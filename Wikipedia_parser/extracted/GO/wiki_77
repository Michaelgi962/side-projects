Bean Brothers

Bean Brothers was a company based in Adelaide, South Australia involved in tanning, leathergoods and shipping ventures in the latter half of the 19th century. Bean Brothers Ltd was set up by the principals to consolidate their assets and develop as wool and produce brokers. They also founded the Adelaide and Port Darwin Sugar Company to develop a sugar plantation in the Northern Territory of Australia. Both ventures failed amid acrimony, recrimination and lawsuits.
The Bean Brothers.
Family tree.
1. George Bean (ca.1805 – 25 April 1869), tanner, founder of a tannery and grindery on banks of River Torrens at Torrensville, and a "colonist of 32 years" was married to Ann, who was accidentally killed on 17 September 1862
W. H. Bean.
George's eldest son William Henry Bean was a prominent South Australian businessman and parliamentarian. He was elected to the Sixth Parliament (paired with Hon. H.B.T. Strangways) for the District of West Torrens of the South Australian House of Assembly, on 28 March 1870, until 23 November 1871, losing his seat after the dissolution of 1871. but was re-elected, with William James Magarey, to the Ninth Parliament (1878-1881) from 2 April 1878 to 19 March 1881, and re-elected, with Frederick Estcourt Bucknall, to the Tenth Parliament from 8 April 1881 to 19 March 1884. (G. T. Bean had held the seat previously and lost it under controversial circumstances. This is one of very few cases in Australia of a pair of brothers being parliamentarians). He campaigned again in 1878 for the West Torrens seat which he narrowly won, and retained it in 1881. He did not contest the 1884 elections.
He conducted the Adelaide affairs of Bean Brothers while G. T. Bean was overseas from 1869 to 1878. He also organised a large number of wool, hide, meat and bark shipments in partnership with H. J. Wilke.
He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1872 but resigned in 1874.
W. H. Bean (with Wilke) bought into a gold discovery "Golding's Find" at Mount Torrens in 1870. and was a director in James Scott's "El Dorado" Mount Pleasant mine in 1872.
He was on the board of the South Australian Zoological and Acclimatization Society. He resigned or was dropped in 1884.
In 1884 Bean Brothers Limited successfully sued him in the Supreme Court for making unauthorised payments. He was declared insolvent in 1885.
He was in London at the time of his brother G. T. Bean's death in 1912.
G. T. Bean.
His second son George Thomas Bean (ca. 1845 – 25 February 1912) (generally known as "G. T. Bean") was a prominent South Australian entrepreneur and parliamentarian. He was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and his business ventures included leather, shipping, and mining in South and Western Australia, and sugar in the Northern Territory of Australia, often in conjunction with one or both of his brothers W. H. and Arthur Bean.
He was elected, with H. B. T. Strangways, to the Fifth Parliament (1868-1870) for the District of West Torrens of the South Australian House of Assembly, on 21 April 1868, the first SA-colony-born person to achieve this. On 19 November 1869 with J. A. Bean he left for London on business, but his application for leave of absence was refused by Parliament, despite a petition from his constituents. His seat was declared vacant on 29 January 1870, due to his "failure to attend". While away he prospected for diamonds in Cape Town, with some success, not returning until 1878. John Pickering won the resulting by-election on 10 February 1870, and the Fifth Parliament was dissolved on 2 March 1870. His brother W. H. Bean successfully stood for West Torrens at the election for the Sixth Parliament.
He was a popular speaker and frequently called upon to officiate at public occasions in the Hindmarsh area.
While an M.P. in 1869 G. T. Bean was brought into mining matters.
He was one of the original shareholders in the Port Augusta and Port Darwin Railway Co. Ltd.
George Bean with Alfred von Doussa proposed diamond mining at Echunga in 1879 but no evidence of any exploration.
G. T. Bean was Chairman of West Australian Mining Company in 1895.
He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Institute of Directors in London. Following a number of operations for cancer, he died in London on 25 February 1912, aged 67. He was survived by his brothers, William living in England, and Arthur in Sydney.
Arthur Bean.
Another brother, Arthur Bate Bean, was often a partner in George's business enterprises.
He too was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution,
He was the driver of a dogcart which overturned, killing his mother Ann. James McEnhill, whose runaway horses upset the carriage, was found not guilty of manslaughter.
He married Rosa Elizabeth Williams in 1866. They had at least eight children and she died 10 June 1917 
From some time before 1867 they lived at "Bleak House", a substantial property on South Road, St Mary's. In 1882 he was found to have acted deceptively in attempting in 1880 to persuade Miss Selina Rogers of Tusmore to sell her nearby property "Sarnia" to one Ernest Alfred Leonard of Western Australia at a price around half its market value. It is not clear what Arthur's motives may have been, but in September 1882 he sold off much of his effects. In 1893 he sold "Bleak House".
He was living at Sussex Street, Glenelg from at least 1902 to 1904.
In 1907 he was boarding and keeping shop at 235 Forbes Street Sydney, New South Wales under the alias "Henry Louis Burton". He was still in Sydney at the time of his brother G. T. Bean's death in 1912.
Arthur's son, Walter W. Bean took over the Hindmarsh tannery and leatherware shop at 158 Rundle Street in 1898. 
A photograph of Arthur Bean may be seen here SLSA picture
The firm of Bean Brothers were leather, wool and produce brokers. In 1882 its principals floated a company Bean Brothers Limited to take over their assets.
Leather goods.
Robert Laundy Ingham and George Bean Snr. established the Thebarton Tannery in competition with William Peacock. In 1839 the partnership was dissolved and Bean Snr. took over the business. In 1840 Bean Snr. opened a shop in Hindley Street previously held by a Mr Crabb, and a year later moved to premises vacated by the firm of Grieve & Campbell on Rundle Street. He was declared insolvent in 1859. A creditor, ex-employee Carl Schoening, charged that Mr Bean withheld cash transactions from the accounts books. Other books which might have supported his claims were not to be found. At this time all three sons were in his employ.
He passed the tannery on to son William H. Bean in 1860. and moved to Sandhurst, Victoria (now named Bendigo), where he was jailed for bankruptcy. In 1861 G. T. Bean, W. H. Bean and Arthur Bean opened as Bean Brothers in larger premises at 108 Hindley Street, retaining the tannery and grindery at Torrensville.
"On 20th January 1865 William Henry Bean, George Thomas Bean and Arthur Bean, of Torrenside, Tanners, were granted Title to 15 acres, part of Section 46 embracing the whole of the area later covered by Fauldings’ premises in Reid Street..." The adjacent Beans Road (now part of Dew Street) may have been named for them. They commenced making shoe and boot uppers, and by the end of 1865 had 14 workers so engaged in King William Street, in part of the building owned by J. Clarkson & Co.
They moved offices to King William Street early 1867 with Arthur handling the retail trade at No. 25 and G. T. Bean at the wholesale business at No. 27, while W. H Bean handled the import of leathergoods, hides and tanning materials. Arthur bought the retail business in April 1867 and the wholesale side in September 1867. On 26 November there was a major fire in the retail shop, determined at an inquest by the Supreme Court as almost certainly arson. Certain inconsistencies of evidence made G. T. Bean the prime suspect, but nothing could be proved. Sometime before 15 September 1868 Arthur sold the business to H. G. Crocker & Co. which was taken over before 4 June 1869 by F. Fischer. This company was affected by another fire, in December 1870, this time originating in the adjoining Adelaide Photographic Company's premises.
Shipping.
While Bean Brothers were running the tannery and leathergoods shop and factory, they were purchasing much of their hides and leather and other materials through agents, then seeing the commercial opportunities in exporting wattle-bark to tanneries in Great Britain, concentrated on that business. At first they were sending consignments as regular cargo but by 1869 they were chartering ships to export the bark from Yankalilla via Normanville, South Australia for London. and by 1870 were exporting all the wattle-bark they could obtain. In one year they shipped 8,000 tons of bark, at prices ranging from £10 to £13 a ton.
In 1871 they purchased and refitted the 560 ton Joshua Bates and appointed Captain Thomas Bicknell to ship bark to London with a back-cargo of timber. Before it could make its first voyage, the ship was set fire by a disgruntled crewman, E. W. Holloway.
Other ships owned or managed by Bean Brothers were the steamer Kura, the Brigantines Nightingale and Mary Bannatyne, the brig African Maid, and schooners St. Kilda (three-masted), Prosperity, Stephen, Lady Darling, and Io.
From 1877 they produced a monthly circular containing information as here [http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/40779139] on demand and prices for wool, skins and bark.
Sugar in the Northern Territory.
In 1881 G. T. Bean floated a company Adelaide and Port Darwin Sugar Company to establish sugar plantations in the Northern Territory. In 1882 he set up a trial sugar plantation on Cox's Peninsula (later Cox Peninsula) across Darwin Harbour from Port Darwin, and organised the hire of 2,000 Singapore Chinese labourers to work the field at ₤1 per week. Investors included Benjamin Cohen De Lissa of Queensland (and after whom the Cox Peninsula suburb and town Delissaville (now Belyuen) and the nearby Delissaville airstrip were named), G. T Bean, W. H. Bean, Arthur Bean, Luther Scammell, George Scarfe and F. W. Stokes. Housing was erected, many cane tubers were supplied by the Government botanist M. W. Holtze from the nursery at Fannie Bay, many more ordered from Queensland and locally and a mill was erected by the Delissa Pioneer Sugar Company. DeLissa, who had been appointed supervisor for his sugar plantation experience, made a trial crushing of 30 tons of cane in December 1881 which returned very little sugar. DeLissa quit in 1882, citing interference by G. T. Bean, who was scathing in his denunciation of DeLissa. W. H. Thompson was brought from Antigua to take over management of the plantations. The machinery was bought for a tenth of its original £6,000 by W. H. Gray, for his Daly River Plantation Company but his plantation also failed, and it was left to rust away. In 1885 the 100,000 acre lease was resumed for non-compliance with the conditions. G. T. Bean was criticised for spending Adelaide and Port Darwin Sugar Company money on worthless land without due diligence, over-extending his stay in London and overspending his allowance there.
Bean Brothers Ltd.
In 1882 Bean Brothers floated Bean Brothers Limited wool and produce brokers with initial subscription of 6,000 £10 shares and total capital of £100,000. Its purpose was to acquire the assets of Bean Brothers (including properties in Grenfell Street, Coromandel Place and French Street) and continue their business as commission agents. Founding directors were W. B. Rounsevell, M.P., Robert Darling, J.P., of Mundoora, W. K. Simms, J.P., John Hill, Seth Ferry, F. E. Bucknall, M.P., and William Whinham of Mount Gambier with W. H. Bean as manager. But two years later the company collapsed among a series of lawsuits, notably that in the Supreme Court against G. W. Bean for over £2000. At a shareholders' meeting it was revealed that it was necessary to make a call of ₤1 per share to pay creditors. The two brothers were insolvent and owed the company money, but were out of South Australian jurisdiction (G. T. Bean being in England and W. H. Bean in Melbourne). Among the causes for the company's collapse was W. H. Bean's unauthorised purchases on company cheques (speculating on chaff for instance). Nor had W. H. Bean maintained the books properly. At the shareholders' meeting anger was expressed that the liquidator, Mr C. Schlumberger, appeared to side with the company principals, not the ordinary shareholder who stood to lose the whole of their investment. The company went into voluntary liquidation in 1885.

Minjur Seawater Desalination Plant

The Minjur Desalination Plant is a reverse osmosis, water desalination plant at Kattupalli village, a northern suburb of Chennai, India, on the coast of the Bay of Bengal that supplies water to the city of Chennai. Built on a 60-acre site, it is the largest desalination plant in India. Originally scheduled to be operational by January 2009, the work on the plant was delayed due to Cyclone Nisha in October 2008, which damaged a portion of the completed marine works and destroyed the cofferdam meant for the installation of transition pipes. The trial runs were completed in June 2010 and the plant was opened in July 2010. Water from the plant will be utilised chiefly for industrial purposes such as the Ennore Port and North Chennai Thermal Power Station. However, during droughts, water from the plant will be supplied to public, serving an estimated population of 500,000.
Water scarcity in the city.
Being a city that depends extensively on ground water, replenished by an average annual rainfall of 1,276 mm, Chennai experiences a chronic water problem. The city receives about 985 mld of water from ground and surface water sources, against the demand of 1,200 mld. Due to an increased usage of groundwater, underground aquifers are being depleted at an rapid rate. By 2031, the demand is expected to increase to about 2,700 mld.
To alleviate the freshwater problems, the state government decided to implement desalination of sea water. Initially, a 100 mld plant was planned at Minjur, followed by another plant with equal capacity at Nemmeli. A third plant with a capacity of 200 mld has been planned at Pattipulam, south of Nemmeli.
Chennai Water Desalination Limited.
Chennai Water Desalination Ltd. (CWDL) is a special purpose vehicle of IVRCL Infrastructure & Projects Ltd. and Befesa Agua of Spain created in 2005 to design, build, own and operate the seawater desalination plant for the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). In September 2005, the CMWSSB signed a bulk water purchase agreement with CWDL to purchase water from the plant at a cost of 48.66/m³ (US$1.03/m³). The water to industries is sold at a rate of 60/m³ (US$1.27/m³). At the end of the 25-year agreement, the plant will be transferred to the state government.
With an installed capacity to produce 100 million liters of drinking water per day (MLD), it is the largest such plant in India. Commercial operations began on 25 July 2010, and average production has been 90 MLD. With Chennai being a burgeoning metropolis with an unfulfilled requirement of nearly 400 MLD of water, this project is the first among a series of desalination plants being planned in the state to meet the deficit in supply.
Operations.
Reverse osmosis technology is employed at the plant to desalinate the sea water, which contains up to 6.4 ppm aluminium and about 50 NTU of turbidity. Energy recovery units help increase the efficiency of the system by recovering kinetic energy from the brine solution and transferring the same to the desalinated water that has passed through the osmotic membrane.
Pre-treatment of the raw sea water includes coagulation-flocculation, gravity, and pressure filtration. The filtered water is then pumped to the plant where it undergoes various preliminary treatments before being passed through the RO trains. The water is then forced through the RO membranes at high pressure. The membranes retain the salts and pass on the desalinated water to the next stage, namely, the post-treatment process. The treated water is then flavoured and stored in a 20 mld underground water tank, from where it is pumped to the Red Hills reservoir and then released into the city grid.
The RO technology of the plant produces 100mld of desalinated water from 273 million litres of sea water.
Components.
The plant consists of 8,600 sea water reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, 248 pressure vessels, 23 pressure exchangers, 5 high-pressure pumps, 16 pressure filter vessels, electrical, automation and control systems and 1,200 m of HDPE pipelines of 1,600 mm diameter. The CMWSSB laid a 33 km pipeline at a cost of 930 million (US$20 million) to carry the treated fresh water from Minjur to Red Hills. The project also included infrastructure for the collection of seawater, including a 110 kV/22 kV sub-station built by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board for uninterrupted power supply to the desalination plant. Before construction of the plant, studies were also conducted on the environmental impact on the livelihoods of fishermen and other communities and the impact of high saline discharge on the fisheries and turtle nesting.
Seawater intake system.
A RCC cylindrical intake well of 5 m diameter and 4m height has been installed nearly 600 m from the shore at a depth of 9 m. A stainless steel screen sits atop the well. The sea water intake pipeline enters the well at the bottom. The HDPE pipeline is 1,600 mm in diameter. It was welded using butt fusion welding machines on the shore before being floated out to the sea and being sunk along the required alignment. The pipeline empties the water into a sea water intake sump on the shore where 3 vertical turbine pumps of variable discharge up to a maximum of 4,000 cum/hr each are used to pump water into the plant. The average intake flow is 9,000 to 10,000 cum/hr, and the average product water output of the plant is about 4,000 cum/hr. The system is designed to work as a self-priming suction for sea water intake.
The plant also has 5 additional intake lines of 560 mm OD as a stand-by intake system. These pipelines have a separate pump house where centrifugal pumps of discharge up to a maximum of 1,500 cum/hr each have been installed. The marine works subcontract (involving laying of the intake pipelines, intake structures and outfall pipeline) was executed by Flowline Systems Pvt Ltd.
Cost.
Chennai Metrowater purchases water from the plant for 48.66 per kilolitre of water in accordance with the bulk water purchase agreement with Chennai Water Desalination Limited, a special purpose vehicle promoted by IVRCL. The tariff is high compared to the plant at Nemmeli since the company that has set up the plant also has to add in capital and operations costs.

Charles Pourtales Golightly

Charles Pourtales Golightly (1807–1885) was an Anglican clergyman and religious writer.
Life.
Golightly was born on 23 May 1807, the second son of William Golightly of Ham, Surrey, gentleman, by his wife, Frances Dodd. His mother's mother, Aldegunda, was granddaughter of Charles de Pourtalès, ‘a distinguished member of an ancient and honourable Huguenot family.’ He was educated at Eton College. In his youth he travelled in Europe, visited Rome, seeing there ‘a good deal of certain cardinals, and entering into their characters and their politics.’ He matriculated 4 March 1824 at Oriel College, Oxford, where he proceeded as B.A. in 1828, M.A. in 1830. His attainments would have justified his election to a fellowship, but as his private property was thought to be a disqualification he took curacies at Penshurst, Kent, and afterwards at Godalming, Surrey.
In 1836, when the chapel of Littlemore, near Oxford, was almost finished, it was suggested that Golightly's means would enable him to take it without an endowment. Golightly entered into the scheme with enthusiasm, and bought one of the curious old houses in Holywell Street, Oxford. A single sermon led, however, to a disagreement with John Henry, later Cardinal Newman, the then vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, to which Littlemore had been an adjunct, and their official connection, though they had been acquaintances from early youth, at once ceased. In this house he remained for the rest of his life, keenly interested in church matters, and struggling against the spread of what he deemed Romanism.
For some time he was curate of Headington; he held the miserably endowed vicarage of Baldon Toot, and he occasionally officiated in the church of St. Peter in the East, Oxford, for Hamilton, afterwards bishop of Salisbury. He was a thorough student of theology and history. His religious views were those of Hooker, and he gloried in the traditions of the old high church party, but his hatred of Romanism, deepened by his Huguenot descent, made him a fierce opponent of ritualism. Even opponents admitted his deep religious feelings and his frank fearlessness. He was friendly with men of every division of thought, and his charity was unbounded and unostentatious. He was full of anecdote, heightened by much dryness of wit, and was always accessible. For the last three years of his life he was haunted by painful illusions, and his death was a release from pain. He died on Christmas Day 1885, and was buried in Holywell cemetery, near Magdalen College, Oxford. Edward Meyrick Goulburn, dean of Norwich reprinted, ‘with additions and a preface, from the “Guardian” of 13 Jan. 1886’ his reminiscences of Golightly. An auction catalogue of his furniture and library was issued in February 1886.
Works.
All his publications were controversial. They comprise:
In the same year (1878) Golightly reissued in separate form, and with his name, his ‘Brief Account of Romeward Movement in Days of Laud.’ The attack on Cuddesdon College was the subject of pp. 358–66, 415–18, vol. ii. of the ‘Life of Bishop Wilberforce,’ and Golightly retorted with ‘A Letter to the Very Reverend the Dean of Ripon, containing Strictures on the Life of Bishop Wilberforce,’ 1881.

Jacob de Graeff

Jacob de Graeff (June 28, 1642 in Amsterdam – April 21, 1690), was a member of the De Graeff-family from the Dutch Golden Age. He was an Amsterdam Regent and held the titles as 20.th Lord of the Free and high Fief Ilpendam and Purmerland. Jacob de Graeff was a member of a family of regents who belonged to the republican political movement also referred to as the ‘state oriented’, as opposed to the Royalists.
Biography.
Jacob was the son of Cornelis de Graeff and Catharina Hooft, and the younger brother of Pieter de Graeff. In 1648 Jacob laid the foundation stone for the new city hall on the Dam. Joost van den Vondel wrote a poem to Jacobs Foundation stone. During the summers the family spent a lot of their time at the Palace Soestdijk, and he and his brother played with the young William III of Orange – who later became King of England, Scotland and Ireland and stadtholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands – at the lake and woods at Soestdijk. After he finished his studies at the University of Harderwijk he returned bag to Amsterdam. In 1666 he married to Maria van der Does. Maria died 3 months later and they had no children.
In 1672 Jacob became a member of the Government of the City of Amsterdam. He was a political advisor to his cousin Johan De Witt. In the rampjaar 1672, after the death of the brothers De Witt and the raise of the House of Orange, the republican-minded faction of the De Graeff family included Jacob and Pieter, their uncle Andries de Graeff and their nephew Lambert Reynst, lost their political positions. In 1674 Jacob sold the hunting lodge and its surrounding fields, now the Soestdijk Palace, for only 18,755 Guilder to William III, and became one of the princes captains in the battle at Reibach near Bonn. In the same year Jacob owned 260.000 Guilder. About that he was one of the richest persons from the Dutch Golden Age. 
Jacob was like his father Cornelis a man who surrounded himself with art and beauty. He was an art collector and patron to some famous artists. Jacob was painted by Gerard Ter Borch, Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael, Thomas de Keyser, Karel Dujardin and Jan Victors and sing by the poet Joost van den Vondel. Jacob owned the castle Ilpenstein. He died 1690; his tomb chapel is to be found in the Oude Kerk at Amsterdam.

Antonio Scopelliti

Antonio Scopelliti (Campo Calabro, January 20, 1935 – Piale, August 9, 1991) was an Italian prosecuting magistrate, murdered by the 'Ndrangheta on behalf of the Sicilian Mafia.
He was a prosecutor at the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione). While on holiday visiting his family in Calabria, he was ambushed on a road on August 9, 1991. At the time he was preparing to argue the government’s case in the final appeal of the Maxi Trial against Cosa Nostra for the Supreme Court. The reason for the killing was to hold up the trial so that the Mafia bosses' legal terms of detention would expire and they would be freed.
The crime still remains unsolved. Two trials were held at the Court of Reggio Calabria against Mafia boss Salvatore Riina and thirteen of the so-called Sicilian Mafia Commission, and a second trial against Bernardo Provenzano and nine other bosses of the Commission, including Filippo and Giuseppe Graviano, Raffaele Ganci, Giuseppe Farinella, Antonino Giuffrè and Nitto Santapaola. All were convicted at first instance in 1996 and 1998 and subsequently acquitted in the Court of Appeals in 1998 and 2000 because the testimonies of the seventeen government witnesses were conflicting.
His daughter Rosanna Scopelliti is the national coordinator of Ammazzateci tutti (Italian for "Kill Us All"), an Italian Antimafia social movement against the 'Ndrangheta.

Michael Lort

Michael Lort (1725–1790) was a Welsh clergyman, academic and antiquary.
Life.
The descendant of a Pembrokeshire family living at Prickeston, he was eldest son of Roger Lort, major of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who married Anne, only child of Edward Jenkins, vicar of Fareham, Hampshire. His father died at Cambrai, 11 May 1745, aged 51, from wounds received at the battle of Fontenoy; his mother died in 1767, aged 69, and in 1778 he erected a monument to their memory, now on the east wall of the chapel of St. Ann in Tenby Church. 
He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 13 June 1743, when he was described as aged 18 and as coming from Tenby school. William Cole adds that he was at Westminster School. His degrees at Cambridge were, B.A. 1746, M.A. 1750, B.D. 1761, and D.D. 1780. He was incorporated at Oxford 7 July 1759. His college offices were: scholar 20 April 1744, sub-fellow 2 Oct. 1749, full fellow 4 July 1750, senior fellow 1768, sublector primus 1753, Latin reader 1754, lector primarius 1755, and Greek reader 1756. On graduating in 1746, Lort acted as librarian to Richard Mead until 1754. 
His preferments were numerous, but for many years not very lucrative. From 1759 to 1771 he held the post of Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge, and in 1768 he applied for the professorship of modern history, when Thomas Gray was given the chair. In 1761 he was appointed chaplain to Richard Terrick, bishop of Peterborough, and about that date he served the vicarage of Bottisham, near Cambridge. From 1779 to 1783 he lived at Lambeth Palace as domestic chaplain to Archbishop Frederick Cornwallis. He was promoted to be librarian at Lambeth in 1785, and he is said to have been librarian to the Duke of Devonshire. In January 1771 he became rector of St. Matthew, Friday Street, London. On 11 April 1780 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Tottenhall in St. Paul's Cathedral (which caused him to vacate his fellowship at Trinity College on Lady day 1781); he obtained in 1789 the rectory of St. Michael, Mile End, adjoining Colchester; and Bishop Beilby Porteus gave him in April 1789 the sinecure rectory of Fulham.
Lort was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1755, remaining a vice-president until 1788, and became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1766. While driving down North Hill, Colchester, in August 1790, Lort was thrown out of his carriage, and he died from the effects of the accident at 6 Savile Row, London, 5 November 1790. He had married, in May 1783, Susannah Norfolk one of the two daughters of Alderman Norfolk of Cambridge. She died on 5 February 1792, aged 50, and was buried in the same vault with her husband in the church of Friday Street, a white marble tablet being placed on its north wall. On the demolition of the building the remains were removed in 1883 to the City of London cemetery at Ilford.
Works.
He published little, but helped others. He printed a couple of sermons (1760 and 1770), edited in 1769 ‘A Projecte conteyning the State of Governmente of the University of Cambridge, 43 Queen Elizabeth,’ in 1785 had ‘a copy of the Alexandrian New Testament printed off on fine vellum,’ and in 1790 published ‘A Short Commentary on the Lord's Prayer,’ from which Granville Sharp in 1806 took the observations on the last two petitions as an appendix to his own work on that subject. John Carter the architect obtained his ‘first insight and encouragement’ from him. 
Some of his manuscript lives were used by Alexander Chalmers in his ‘Biographical Dictionary.’ James Granger obtained his aid in his portrait-dictionary, he assisted John Nichols in the "Gentleman's Magazine" and in other undertakings, and he contributed to "Archæologia". Letters to and from him and Cole, Thomas Percy, and Horace Walpole are in Nichols's ‘Literary Anecdotes,’ and ‘Illustrations of Literary History,’ and there are some letters and notes from him in Granger's ‘Letters.’ 
Lort's English verses from the ‘Gratulatio Academiæ Cantabrigiensis,’ 1748, on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, are reprinted in Nichols's ‘Collection of Poems,’ and another English poem by him is in Thomas Zouch's ‘Works.’ The Greek verses in four collections of the university of Cambridge (1760–3) which bear Lort's name are reprinted in Zouch's ‘Works,’ (by whom it appears that they were written). His notes on the authorship of the "Whole Duty of Man" are in Nichols's ‘Literary Anecdotes,’ and his vindication of Horace Walpole with respect to Thomas Chatterton is in the ‘Illustrations of Literary History,’ 
His books were sold from 5 April to 14 May 1791, and produced £1269, and his prints, which were disposed of on 26 May and six following days, fetched £401.

Gorbea Natural Park

Gorbea Natural Park is a protected area that is located between the provinces of Alava and Vizcaya in the Basque Country (Spain), the highest Basque natural park with an area of . It covers Villaro municipalities, Castillo and Elejabeitia, Orozco, and Ceberio Ceánuri in Vizcaya and Cigoitia, Zuya and Urcabustaiz in Álava. Gorbea Natural Park, along with the nearby natural park of Urkiola, form an important environmental unit. Natural Park was declared by the Basque Government Decree on 21 June 1994 with the purpose of protecting their natural heritage while promoting rural development, understanding and enjoyment. It takes its name from its highest peak, the Gorbea (Gorbeia or Gorbeiagane in Euskera) of . Other peaks of interest are Aldamin Peña of and the Peñas de Itxina.
Communications and access to the park.
Access to Gorbea Park is based on the national highway N-240 linking Bilbao to Vitoria, which surrounds the park to the east. To the west it is surrounded by the AP-68, which also links Bilbao and Vitoria and local roads, such as BI-2522 and A-624. The BI-3513 county of Orozco Artea] allows access to the north and the N -622 in the south.
The bus service linking Bilbao and Vitoria, or Barazar Altube, is another means of access to the park.
Interpretive centers.
There are two interpretive centers: one in the Alava, near the town of Sarria and another in the town of Villaro or Areatza in Vizcaya. There information can be found about the Natural Park as well as an exhibition that describes the characteristics of the park.
Mount Gorbea, the heart of the park.
Gorbea Natural Park is formed around Mount Gorbea, and the peaks surrounding it. The summit of above sea level is a fundamental reference of the habitants of Alava and Vizcaya. For the Basques the Gorbea has been one of the mountains bocineros of which are calling for General Meetings. The summit of the mountain is surmounted by a cross of in height (the first that was installed was and the second ) installed in the early twentieth century and has become a symbol for all Basques coming to form part of popular culture.
Climate.
The altitude of Gorbea Natural Park gives it a typical mountain climate, and acts as a major barrier to stop the wet winds from the Gulf of Biscay, with substantive differences between the northern, more humid, and the south, dry and sunny.
Rainfall is abundant, present in all months of the year, although the fall and winter months are the rainy seasons. In general, are higher than / year in the northern slope, which may exceed in the summit. On the south side down to about rainfall about / year.
The average annual temperature between in the valleys Basques to in higher areas. Precipitation in these latter areas is in the form of snow during the winter months, which remains until early spring.
The difference in precipitation and temperatures between the area of Vizcaya and Alava are evident in various aspects such as flora or geology. Due to the effect more of the abundant rains are in the northern part of the massif and the southern part is characterized by a climate of Continental influence.
Geology and geomorphology.
Geologically Gorbeia is mostly composed of sedimentary rocks. They have been created by erosion processes whose sediments were transported inland sea and then lithified (the process by which sediments are transformed into a compact rock.) .
The park is known for its rocky surroundings. Formations as the Eye of Atxular or Atxular Itxina in karst and the cave in Álava Mairuelegorreta accidents are the most notable.
In the park there are two types of substrates:
Silica forms of landscape originates rounded, dark tones and lush vegetation. Gorbea summit is a good example.
Limestone: light-colored surfaces and rocky, limestone areas are characterized by the presence of cracks, potholes and depressions. There are 500 chambers listed in the Park, of which the cave and Supelegor Mairuelegorreta are most popular. In the limestone karst highlight Itxina complex, which evolved over Urgonian extracts (characteristics of the limestone) that have caused one of the best examples of forms of Euskal Herria kartice.
The hydrography of Gorbea, which pours into the Mediterranean and Cantabrian consists of small rivers that should save a significant gap forming gullies and ravines. In the Mediterranean, which run to Álava, there is the Zubialde Bayas River, in the Cantabrian Altube, Arnuari, and Arratia Zeberio.
Flora and fauna.
With regard to vegetation, the area holds important deciduous forests, especially in the aspect of Alava (Altube area). The tree that occupies the largest area with about 6,000 have been, but we also found robledades sessile oak and pedunculate oak, and sketches of Cantabrian holm oak and strawberry trees reveal that centuries ago the climate was much warmer. Alders, willows, ash, and poplars are increasingly rare riparian forests found to shelter species of great interest. The conifers, mostly exotic species planted for forestry, occupy much of the Park's area, among the most representative of these plantations are insignis and radiata pine (Pinus radiata), Lawson cypress and the black pine (Pinus nigra).
Excessive logging that occurred since the eighteenth century intended for work in the foundries, shipbuilding and papermaking even led to the provincial council to decree that the repopulation of the cleared areas, would be done with commercial species.
There is a large representation of species of fauna, forest raptors (hawk, hawk, eagle toed) and rupícolas (peregrine falcon, Egyptian vulture), mammals (bobcat, deer, polecats, martens, marten and dormouse). The ponds and wetlands are home to a good representation of amphibians (Alpine newt and frog agile). Carrion vultures have the Park as part of its territory but do not nest in it, they come from the nearby Parque Natural de la Sierra Urkiola and Saved and Valderejo Natural Park.
Places to visit..
There are many landscapes that are worth visiting, but the best known are: Cruz del Gorbea, Itxina Karst, The meadows of Araba, Mairuelegorreta cave, waterfall and wetland Gujuli Saldropo.
Population.
In the park there are no inhabited areas but there is a scattered population living in villages, there is a seasonal population, pastoralists, living in shacks during pasture season. The small towns surrounding the park are home to some 9,000 people and its economy is founded on farms, herds of latxa sheep, cattle and horses, and forestry. Subsistence agriculture is the sale of surplus in the markets of the regions concerned.
"Population history of the occupation"
The first humans of which there is evidence in the park territories date back to 100,000 years before Christ, in the Middle Paleolithic, five teeth of a Neanderthal have been found and identified. No evidence was found for the occupation of cromangones and is believed to be due to harsh weather in the Upper Paleolithic period in the cave. Similar Arrillor lithic remains of Magdalenian type in the cave were found relaing to Bolinkoba piety, antlers and bones with geometric prints. Mesolithic finds in the cave there Urratxa III belonging to the so-called culture Azilian.
They built the largest Neolithic stone monuments, normally for funerary use. The dolmens and barrows are easy to observe structures within the park. More than 10 dolmens and burial mounds are located in the current grazing areas.
The isolation of these territories means the influence of historical movements have been minimal. The life forms of Neolithic pastoralism have remained unchanged to the present.Only the occupation of some isolated settlements of farmers has allowed a change in the historical record. This has favored the conservation delentorno with the values that have and are currently protected.
Unlike neighboring Urquiola Natural Park, which has historically been an important route of communication, Gorbea has remained outside, keeping the traditional ways of life until the advent of technological revolutions succeeded in making a dent in them. Therefore traditional buildings, such as water mills, predator, refrigerators and evidence of the coal industry are now beautifully preserved, one of its main actrativos, along with the natural course.
The main activity that has historically been developed in the territories that make up the park is grazing. This activity was completed by the manufacture of lime, by firing limestone kilns, charcoal making and the manufacture of ice in a refrigerator. Of these the only activity that remains is that of grazing, and the remains of its other facilities are used to develop a new source of wealth for the area, urban tourism. Gorbea Natural Park has become a place to which people flock from nearby urban areas, especially in Bilbao and Vitoria, for sports and leisure activities.
In the park there are about 13 chapels, the most important of which is the shrine of Our Lady of the Snows. During the mid-twentieth century Club Deportivo de Bilbao Egiriñao built a shelter.
In an area like the land surrounding the Gorbea, where outside influences have been reluctant to enter, the mythology has been kept alive in its residents. There is the main goddess Mari, the Lady of Anboto, whose house is seen from many parts of the park, and the forests are inhabited by the Basajaun and on the banks of the river, the ladies with flippers, the Lamiak.

Elizabeth Bury

Elizabeth Bury (1644–1720) was an English diarist.
Early life.
Bury was baptised 12 March 1644 at Clare, Suffolk, the day of her birth having probably been 2 March. Her father was Captain Adams Lawrence of Linton, Cambridgeshire; her mother was Elizabeth Cutts of Clare, and besides Elizabeth there were three other children. In 1648, when Elizabeth was four years old, Captain Lawrence died, and in 1661 Mrs. Lawrence remarried, her second husband being Nathaniel Bradshaw, B.D., minister of a church in the neighbourhood. 
About 1664 Elizabeth described herself as "converted", and became introspective. Her studies were Hebrew, French, music, heraldry, mathematics, philosophy, philology, anatomy, medicine, and divinity. Her stepfather, Mr. Bradshaw was of the ejected ministers in 1662, the family moved to Wivelingham, Cambridgeshire. Elizabeth in 1664 began writing down her "experiences" in her "Diary", initially in shorthand.'
Adult life.
In 1667, on 1 February, Bury married Griffith Lloyd of Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire, who died on 13 April 1682. In her widowhood, which lasted another fifteen years, Mrs. Lloyd passed part of her time in Norwich. She was married at Bury to Samuel Bury, nonconformist minister, on 29 May 1697, having previously refused to marry three churchmen, whose initials are given, because "she could not be easy in their communion".'
Mrs. Bury had a good estate, and was a generous benefactor. She kept a stock of bibles and practical books, to be distributed from time to time; she had a knowledge of materia medica. She had a motto written up in her closet in Hebrew, "Thou, Lord, seest me." She became infirm after 1712, and died 8 May 1720, aged 76. Her funeral sermon was preached at Bristol on 22 May 1720 by the Rev. William Tong, and was printed at Bristol the same year; a third edition was reached the next year, 1721. "The Account of the Life and Death of Mrs. Bury", Bristol, 1720, included the extant portions of her diary, the funeral sermon, a life by her husband, and an elegy by Isaac Watts.

2011 Vacansoleil-DCM season

The 2011 season for the cycling team began in January at the Tour Down Under and ended in November at the Amstel Curaçao Race. As a UCI ProTeam, they were automatically invited and obligated to send a squad to every event in the UCI World Tour; Vacansoleil-DCM became a ProTeam for the first time ahead of the 2011 season.
Improving upon 14 victories in the 2010 season, Vacansoleil-DCM managed 22 victories during the season. Having previously been invited to the 2009 Vuelta a España, Vacansoleil-DCM contested the other Grand Tour events – the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France – for the first time. Despite rumours that the team faced exclusion to the doping scandals involving team members Riccardo Riccò and Ezequiel Mosquera, they were included pursuant to UCI rules. The team rarely featured in the Giro, while the team was more successful at the Tour de France. Johnny Hoogerland held the lead of the mountains classification on two occasions, while Romain Feillu finished in the top five on four stages during the first half of the race. Hoogerland also made headlines when he and 's Juan Antonio Flecha were sideswiped by a car while they rode in a breakaway. Outside of the Grand Tours, Thomas De Gendt took World Tour stage victories at Paris–Nice and the Tour de Suisse, with Borut Božič also taking a stage win in Switzerland.
The team were also successful in single-day races, with six different riders all achieving a victory. Despite all the victories, the team finished last in the UCI World Tour rankings, since the majority of their victories came during UCI Europe Tour races. ProTeams, though eligible to participate in the races, were not eligible to earn points toward the Europe Tour ranking (just as Professional Continental teams could not earn points toward the World Tour ranking).
2011 roster.
Ages as of January 1, 2011.
One-day races.
Spring classics.
The team started the single-day season with a third place finish for Feillu at the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise in January, and first-year professional Ligthart taking a similar placing in February's Clásica de Almería. In March, Westra took his first victory since the 2009 Tour de Picardie, by winning the Classic Loire Atlantique, in France. After creating a four-man breakaway with Anthony Geslin of , 's Jean-Marc Marino and rider Frédéric Amorison, they were joined by five other riders within the last ; one of the five, Amorison's team-mate Bert Scheirlinckx attacked in the closing stages but Westra followed and outsprinted him to the line, eventually winning by two seconds. Four days later, Marcato finished sixth in Dwars door Vlaanderen. Ligthart won his first race as a professional in April, by winning Hel van het Mergelland in a sprint finish of 26 riders.
The following day, Leukemans was in contention for victory at the Tour of Flanders, attacking off the front of the field on the Molenberg, remaining in contention with the persistent attacks by other riders within the last of the event; Leukemans was aided by De Gendt and Devolder, but could do no better than a seventh place finish. In the Grand Prix Pino Cerami, Marcato finished in second place, having been part of an eleven-man breakaway formed with around remaining, before losing to Scheirlinckx in a two-man sprint after the two had jettisoned their fellow escapees. Leukemans suffered the same result in Brabantse Pijl, losing out to 's Philippe Gilbert in another two-man sprint, after the two riders attacked off the front of a seven-man lead group. Following a second place at the Grand Prix de Denain, Feillu won the Tour du Finistère in mid-April, gapping the field in an uphill sprint to the line. Leukemans continued his good form into the Ardennes classics, taking seventh place in the Amstel Gold Race, and ninth in Liège–Bastogne–Liège.
May was not as successful for the team, as Marcato finished in sixth place in the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop at the start of the month, and Ruijgh took seventh place in the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan, towards the end of the month. Keizer took his first professional victory, by winning the Boucles de l'Aulne. From a breakaway of five riders, Keizer attacked in the closing stages, and soloed to the win. While in June, Gardeyn finished fourth in the Tour de Rijke, Ruijgh finished second to 's Dirk Bellemakers in the Ruddervoorde Koerse national event, and Veuchelen finished eighth in Halle–Ingooigem.
The team also sent squads to the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, Le Samyn, the Nokere Koerse, the Handzame Classic, Milan – San Remo, the Cholet-Pays de Loire, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent–Wevelgem, the Scheldeprijs, Paris–Roubaix, the Tro-Bro Léon, La Flèche Wallonne, the GP Herning, the Rund um Köln, the ProRace Berlin, and the Gullegem Koerse, but placed no higher than 12th in any of these races.
Fall races.
Shortly after the Tour de France, Božič took third place in the Vattenfall Cyclassics. Willem Wauters – who joined the team as a stagiaire in August – made an immediate impact for the team, finishing second behind 's Svein Tuft in the Grote Prijs Stad Zottegem, while the following day, Leukemans followed up his overall win from the Tour du Limousin with victory in Druivenkoers Overijse – for the second year in succession – beating 's Davy Commeyne and Jurgen Van Goolen of to the line.
The team achieved more top-ten placings in September, taking six within the space of a week; Božič finished ninth in the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen, and sixth in Paris–Brussels, while Leukemans finished sixth in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec World Tour race, and third on his return to Europe, in the Grand Prix de Wallonie. Feillu and Marcato each took a seventh place in the Grand Prix de Fourmies, and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal respectively. Mouris and Keizer finished third in Duo Normand, while on the same day, Božič finished fourth in the Grand Prix d'Isbergues. In October, Marcato took his first professional win in the Tour de Vendée, and also finished second to 's Greg Van Avermaet in Paris–Tours, Feillu finished eighth in Paris–Bourges, and Devolder finished seventh in the Chrono des Nations time trial. Hoogerland completed the team's year, in November, with third place in the Amstel Curaçao Race.
The team also sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, the Dutch Food Valley Classic, the Châteauroux Classic, the GP Ouest-France, the Schaal Sels-Merksem, the Grote Prijs Jef Scherens, the Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen, Omloop van het Houtland, Binche–Tournai–Binche, the Nationale Sluitingsprijs, and the Giro di Lombardia, but finished no higher than 11th in any of these races.
Stage races.
The team was very successful at the Tour Méditerranéen in February, as Feillu won three consecutive stages, along with the points classification, and Poels finished as the best young rider in third place overall, having finished in the same position on the final and most difficult stage. Westra finished third in the Volta ao Algarve, before De Gendt took the team's first World Tour stage win of the season, managing to just outlast the advancing field in a sprint finish to the opening stage of Paris–Nice. Feillu took another stage victory at May's Tour de Picardie, en route to an eventual overall victory in the race. The following week at the Circuit de Lorraine, De Gendt won the third stage – giving him the race lead for a time – and Feillu won the fifth and final stage, with De Gendt finishing at the top of the mountains classification, and the team won their respective classification. Westra won the opening prologue of the Tour of Belgium, with the squad eventually winning the teams classification. Feillu took his eighth victory of the season at June's Tour de Luxembourg, taking the final stage win.
Later in June, the team took two stage victories in the Tour de Suisse; in the fifth stage into Tägerschen, following an attack by Marcato, Božič took out the uphill sprint to the line, and on the seventh stage that finished in Austrian town Serfaus, De Gendt triumphed after breaking clear of a 17-man group with remaining on the stage, eventually winning the stage by over half a minute. Held concurrently with the Tour de France, van Leijen won the second stage of the Tour de Wallonie, with Selvaggi later finishing on top of the mountains classification, and the squad took another teams classification win. Poels claimed a stage win during the Tour de l'Ain in August, eventually finishing the race second overall after cracking from the race lead on the final stage, but did win the race's sprints classification. Hoogerland also took the team's sixth mountains classification win of the year. Leukemans completed the team's stage race successes with a stage and overall win at the Tour du Limousin.
The team also won lesser classifications at the Étoile de Bessèges, the Critérium International, the Three Days of De Panne, and the Tour de Pologne. The team also sent squads to the Tour Down Under, the Vuelta a Andalucía, Driedaagse van West-Vlaanderen, Vuelta a Murcia, Tirreno–Adriatico, the Volta a Catalunya, the Tour of the Basque Country, Ronde van Drenthe, the Tour de Romandie, the Four Days of Dunkirk, the Critérium du Dauphiné, the Delta Tour Zeeland, the Ster ZLM Toer, the Danmark Rundt, the Eneco Tour, the Tour of Britain, the Tour de Wallonie-Picarde, and the Tour of Beijing, but did not achieve a stage win, classification win, or podium finish in any of them.
Grand Tours.
Giro d'Italia.
The UCI considered a potential revoking of Vacansoleil-DCM's ProTeam licence in mid-February, which would stop the team from automatically being invited to any World Tour race and be demoted to a Professional Continental team, as they were in 2010. This licence issue came to light due to continued investigations into doping regarding two of the team's riders; Mosquera and Riccò. Mosquera had tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch at the 2010 Vuelta a España, while Riccò had been admitted to hospital earlier in February, amid allegations that he had carried out a self-administered autologous blood transfusion at his home. (For more information on the Riccò allegations, see the Dismissal of Riccardo Riccò section) 
Despite talk of a potential exclusion from the race due to these scandals, the team were included in the list of 23 teams admitted, on March 7, per UCI rules. Carrara was the team's leader for the race, while Božič and Hoogerland were named to the squad to aim for stage wins and breakaway representation. The team's showing in the stage 1 team time trial was average, as they came home 10th of the 23 teams, 37 seconds off the winning pace set by . Božič finished near the front of the field in the Giro's first road stage, taking fifth in the mass sprint finish to the second stage, in Parma. Hoogerland and Selvaggi made breakaway attempts on stages 7 and 8, but neither could hold a sustainable advantage until the end of each stage. Carrara moved into the top ten overall after stage 9, finishing 14th on the race's first summit finish, at Mount Etna. Selvaggi took the team's only top-ten placing in the second half of the race by finishing eighth in a mass sprint finish on stage 12, while Carrara eventually finished the race as the team's highest placed rider in the general classification, finishing 17th overall.
Tour de France.
Feillu was the team's leader for the Tour, leading a youthful team into the race, with three riders – De Gendt, Poels and Ruijgh – eligible for the young rider classification. Westra made the first breakaway of the Tour along with two other riders, while the team finished 20th of the 22 teams in the team time trial. It was not until stage 3 that the team finished highly; Feillu finished second behind 's Tyler Farrar, with Božič also making it into the top ten, in eighth position. Hoogerland and Westra made breakaway manoeuvres on stages 4 and 6 respectively, but again could not muster a big enough advantage for a stage victory. Hoogerland did however take the lead of the mountains classification at the conclusion of the sixth stage, where Feillu had finished fourth and Marcato ninth. Feillu took another fourth place the following day on the seventh stage into Châteauroux.
Hoogerland made another break from the peloton on the ninth stage, as he was joined by five other riders who extended their lead over the field. With remaining, Hoogerland and fellow escapee Juan Antonio Flecha of were involved in a dramatic crash; while attempting to overtake the riders, a support car from France Télévisions sideswiped Flecha, and as a result, caused Hoogerland to crash into a barbed wire fence, and would later require 33 stitches to close gashes on his leg. Prior to the crash, Hoogerland had gained enough points on the stage to retake the lead of the mountains classification from 's Tejay van Garderen. Flecha and Hoogerland both finished the stage and were jointly awarded the combative rider award for the day. Marcato made the breakaway on stage ten, with Feillu and Božič again making the top ten at stage end; Feillu finished fifth with Božič three places behind, in eighth place. Feillu closed the first half of the race, with sixth place on stage 11.
None of the team's riders featured prominently in the early mountain stages, as it was not until stage 16 when Vacansoleil-DCM returned to the top ten of a stage result, with Marcato finishing eighth into Gap. Božič was tenth on stage 17 and seventh on the final stage, sandwiching two top ten placings for De Gendt, who finished sixth on stage 19 to Alpe d'Huez, and fourth on the following day's individual time trial. At the race's conclusion, the team's highest-placed rider was Ruijgh in 21st, some 33 minutes down on race winner Cadel Evans of .
Vuelta a España.
Although the team had 2010 runner-up Mosquera on their books, they elected not to send him – having been on the team's pre-selection list – to the race due to the ongoing investigation into his positive doping case for hydroxyethyl starch. Instead, the team elected to place leadership upon the shoulders of Poels, who had taken second place and a stage victory in the Tour de l'Ain, held one week before the Vuelta. The team started with another mediocre performance in the team time trial, coming in 18th of the 22 teams, but Pidgornyy was part of a successful four-man breakaway on the third stage, and although he eventually finished 15 seconds down on the eventual stage winner Pablo Lastras (), Pidgornyy moved into fourth place in the general classification.
Poels featured in the top ten of the next two stages, the sharp incline to Sierra Nevada – finishing eighth, two places behind team-mate Lagutin – and was the closest to 's Joaquim Rodríguez on the steep finish into Valdepeñas de Jaén. He also tried to make a late-stage move, within the final , on the eighth stage, but was unsuccessful, as he was swallowed up by the main field prior to the 20% gradient final climb to the line. Ligthart and Keizer made their way into the breakaway on stage 9, with both being dropped before the climb to La Covatilla. Pidgornyy made it into his second breakaway of the race, as the race moved into its second half, on stage 12, but he and rider Luis Angel Maté were overhauled with just remaining.
As the race began to take shape in the Cantabrian Mountains, Poels continued his impressive Vuelta by again featuring in the top five of a stage, by taking fourth place on stage 14. Having stayed with the main group of overall contenders, Poels managed to stay with the likes of 's Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, while others such as Rodríguez and defending race winner Vincenzo Nibali of had faded out of contention. The next day, the race headed to the summit finish of the Angliru for the first time in three years, and while 's Juan José Cobo soloed into his eventual race-winning general classification lead, Poels was his closest challenger, 48 seconds in arrears but sufficient enough to move him into the top ten overall. Poels slipped out of the top ten after losing time on the finish to Peña Cabarga, and thus tried to make a breakaway the following day, on stage 18, but was not given the freedom to break and finished with the main field. Poels ultimately finished the race 17th, but the team's best-placed rider honour went to Lagutin, who finished almost three minutes ahead in 15th place.
Away from competition.
Dismissal of Riccardo Riccò.
Having made his season début with a seventh place in the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise in France on January 30, and prior to travelling to the Tour Méditerranéen, Riccò was admitted to hospital in Pavullo nel Frignano on February 6, with his father Rubinho stating that his son had apparent "kidney failure" and a body temperature of ; he was later transferred to a hospital in Modena. Two days later, the Italian State Police confirmed that they were investigating Riccò for blood doping, after an apparent self-administered autologous blood transfusion at his home, and obtained his medical records while Riccò was in hospital recovering. His team also released a statement that day, calling the reports "a rumour", but started their own investigation into the matter, and if found to have doped, Riccò would be sacked as a violation of UCI anti-doping rules.
Personalities within the cycling world condemned Riccò for returning to doping, having already served a 20-month ban for the banned blood booster CERA in 2008. After conducting their investigation, the team announced that they had suspended Riccò on February 11, also indicating that they had sent a letter of their decision to Riccò. Following this scandal, as well as the continued allegations over team-mate Mosquera in 2010, the UCI had planned to look at the credibility of having the team at the highest echelon of the sport – as a ProTeam – with Riccò's points making up a proportion of the team's allocation in regards to a ProTeam licence. Riccò was sacked by the team on February 19, on the basis of their "zero-tolerance policy" on doping. The team later announced a more stringent policy on how they deal with doping. Having previously given Leukemans a second chance after a positive test for artificial testosterone, team manager Daan Luijkx stated that the team would not give riders a second chance to prove their capabilities after Riccò's situation.
Riccò announced his intention to never race again in March, but signed with Continental team Meridiana-Kamen in June in the hope of competing in the Tour de Serbie. This did not transpire, as he was suspended by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the race, in relation to the February blood transfusion. He eventually received a twelve-year ban from the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal in April 2012.

Paambadam

Paambadam is an ear ring worn by elderly women in South Indian States such as Tamil Nadu & Kerala.
Designed in the shape of a snake hood, with two balls, two knobs, a square piece and a tongue pieced together, the gold coated ear rings weigh about 50gms. each.
Paambadam in Tamil means the hood of the snake(paambin padam).
The sheer weight of a paambadam enlarges the ear lobe, which has to be pierced with a special knife for gradual expression.
Paambadam would be worn with one or two others of similar size and weight, pulling down and stretching the earlobe considerably. The remarkable semi-abstract design actually incorporates animal forms, showing the head of a snake.
Currently due to more modernisation, such earrings are not worn.

55th Infantry Division (United States)

The US 55th Infantry Division was a 'phantom division' created in October 1943 to cover the departure of the US 5th Infantry Division from Iceland. An entirely notional force, its existence was reported to the Germans only through controlled agents as Iceland was too far from Europe to make use of radio deception.
World War II.
Between March and July 1944 the division (along with the fictional 7th, 9th and 10th Ranger Battalions) was presented as being part of the British VII Corps of the British Fourth Army. It was a mountain trained division intended to act as the reinforcing unit for the British 52nd Infantry Division in the attack on Narvik. When 'Fortitude North' was closed down, the division was presented as being part of a force designed to follow up the German evacuation of Norway. It was disposed of by announcing during late 1944 that the division was leaving Iceland, with the final units leaving by March 1945.

Holy Trinity Avonside

Holy Trinity Avonside was a heritage-listed Anglican church located in Linwood, Christchurch, New Zealand. It is registered as a "Historic Place – Category I" by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. It was "damaged beyond the point of repair" in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and was demolished the following September.
History.
The Parish of the Most Holy Trinity Avonside was established in 1855, with the first service held in the Rev. Charles Mackie's home "Stricklands". The first service was held in a church building designed by Charles Edward Fooks and made of cob at Christmas Day 1855, but the church was only consecrated on 24 February 1857; it was the first Anglican church in Canterbury consecrated by Bishop Harper. The land for the church had been provided by John and Elizabeth Stace, who had arrived in Lyttelton on the "Nugent" in 1851. Architect Benjamin Mountfort, a parishioner, designed additions to the church including a bell tower and timber vestry in 1869. Around 1873, further Mountfort-designed additions included a stone chancel and transepts. In 1905 the original cob building was replaced by a stone nave designed by Mountfort's son Cyril Mountfort. In 1953–1954 the west end of the church was extended, removing the remaining pre-1870s part of the building.
The church received damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Repairs were under way when the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake struck, when the church building suffered major damage including collapse of the chancel and most of the transepts. The church was "damaged beyond the point of repair". Workers repairing damage on the inside of the 1876 Mountfort-designed part of the church were having lunch outside when this part of the building collapsed. The church was demolished in September 2011 amidst much controversy. Heritage advocates claimed that the church was of higher importance than ChristChurch Cathedral and more should have been done to try and save it, or it should have at least been dismantled by hand to save important architectural features like the ceilings, but instead diggers smashed everything up. Bishop Victoria Matthews defended the demolition, stating that her "priority has to be humans and the safety of the community. It wasn't the time to take chances." A time capsule containing the words of the consecration was recovered from underneath the nave.
Graveyard.
The church graveyard is the burial place of some prominent Cantabrians including:
Heritage listing.
On 16 November 1989, the church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 3113. Among Mountfort's churches, it is significant as it is his first Anglican stone church. The graveyard is also significant for the number of important people buried there. The parish was one of the first to be established in Christchurch.

Red Eclipse

Red Eclipse is a multi-platform, free, and open source first-person arena shooter that runs on the . The game is predicated around multiplayer based action, but can also be played offline against bots.
Gameplay.
"Red Eclipse" is a multiplayer first-person shooter with a style of play often compared to "Quake III Arena" or "Unreal Tournament", though the lead developer claims it is intended as a subversion of common mechanics in the arena FPS sub-genre.
The game consists of a variety of modes, which can be extended with any of fourteen "mutators". For example, the "Capture the Flag" mode can be used in conjunction with the "Instagib" and "Jetpack" mutators, changing how the game is played. This allows players to experience more flexibility and variety when playing the same mode. There are also seven mode-exclusive mutators, which can only be played in certain modes.
Aside from the more traditional modes of its genre - among them "Deathmatch", "Capture the Flag", and "Defend the Flag" (akin to King of the Hill), "Red Eclipse" offers two more modes of play. "Bomber-Ball" pits two teams against one another with the objective of throwing the bomb into the enemy team's goal before it explodes, and "Time-Trial", in which players race through a level to compete for the best times.
Bots are also available for all modes and mutators when teams are short of human players, as well as for offline practice matches.
"Red Eclipse's" weapon arsenal consists of a pistol, sword, shotgun, submachine gun, flamethrower, plasma gun, rifle, grenade, mine and rocket launcher, each with primary and alternate methods of attack. Each weapon also has variables that the player can alter to change their behavior, such as particle size, accuracy, the reload and fire rates, and damage.
Movement and physics.
The game's "Impulse" and parkour systems allow the player a variety of ways to move about a level via wall-kicking, wall-running, dashing on the ground and mid-air, and double-jumping. Similarly to the weapon variables, there is also a list of environmental variables, allowing players to easily create their own modes. Variables pertaining to physics, such as jump height or distance, movement speed, and gravity, are all changeable in-game to allow for different gameplay.
Game modes and mutators.
"Red Eclipse" has six different game modes excluding the in-game editor and demo: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Defend the Flag, Bomber-ball, Time-Trial and Gauntlet.
By default, the game is on team play (Alpha team vs. Omega team) unless the player selects FFA or Multi mutators
In addition to the game modes, there are fourteen mutators which extend the game modes:
Furthermore, "Red Eclipse"'s game modes could have multiple mutators to extend the mode, such as having Capture the Flag with the Instagib, Teamplay, and jetpack mutators, which enables one-shot-one-kill styled gameplay, and players to fly around.
It also has some support for maps, allowing players to play their favourite Sauerbraten maps.
Development.
"Red Eclipse" is built upon the . The first version (1.0) was released on the 15th of March, 2011. The game code is under the permissive Free zlib License, and the game data assets are mainly under the Copyleft License CC-BY-SA-3.0.
Technical details.
"Red Eclipse" utilizes the Cube 2 engine, which uses a 6-directional heightfield (or octree) world model. An octree in Red Eclipse is a cube that can be split into eight smaller cubes that can then be done the same to. This allows for complex level geometry and easier editing which can be accomplished through the game's built in editor.
Rendering engine.
The original "Cube" engine's rendering engine assumed that overdraw (where polygons that do not appear in the final scene are occluded via the z-buffer) was more processor-intensive than sending new streams of triangles to the graphics processing every frame, which limited its performance on more modern hardware where memory bandwidth is a greater limiting factor. Instead, "Red Eclipse" uses the rendering engine in Cube 2, which is designed around modern graphics processing units, which perform best with huge batches of geometry already stored in video memory. Lighting is precomputed into lightmaps—image files that correspond to geometry as textures—for efficient batching, with an additional stored directional component, that allows for efficient shader-based lighting effects.
Map editor.
"Red Eclipse" retains the Cube engine's built-in map editor, in which the player is able to fly around the game world manipulating and deforming volumes referred to as cubes. This, as well as weapon and other entity placement is achieved in real-time, and can be done cooperatively online with other players as well. AI "waypoints" can also be generated dynamically as the level is played. Lighting is accomplished through precomputed lightmaps. Each cube-shaped node in the octree represents a renderable volume, simply referred to as a "cube". Each edge of this cube can be lengthened or shortened to deform the cube into a variety of other shapes. Corners of cubes can also be "pushed" or "pulled" to create crude curves.
The what you see is what you get realtime editing ability has enabled level designers to add a plethora of detail to maps, while reducing the time spent on actual creation. This is in contrast to traditional modern polygon soup 3D engines which take a model generated as an essentially random batch of triangles from an external modelling program, and attempt to spatially subdivide the model's triangles after the fact by splitting them to fit into tree structures, such as a BSP tree or even an octree, that require costly pre-processing to build.

Mayflower (tugboat)

Mayflower is a steam tug (tugboat) built in Bristol in 1861 and now preserved by Bristol Museums Galleries & Archives. She is based in Bristol Harbour at M Shed (formerly Bristol Industrial Museum). She is the oldest Bristol-built ship afloat and is believed to be the oldest surviving tug in the world.
She was built by GK Stothert & Co, who were connected with the Bath-based engineering company Stothert & Pitt. A branch of the family came to Bristol to build railway locomotives (later to become the Avonside Engine Company). After 1852, a separate shipbuilding company was established which survived in business until the 1930s.
"Mayflower" was built to work on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and in the River Severn, one of three tugs ordered after trials had shown how much more efficient than horses they were. Altogether they cost £3000.
"Mayflower" started working between Sharpness and Gloucester Docks, towing trains of small sailing vessels such as trows and ketches, and, after the new docks at Sharpness were completed in 1874, larger steamers one at a time. By the late 1890s she was the most seaworthy tug in the fleet, and she was altered to make her suitable for work in the Bristol Channel. The old single-cylinder engine was replaced in 1899 with a vertical compound condensing engine supplied, along with a new boiler, funnel, propeller and shafting by W.Sisson & Co. of Gloucester for £940. The steering position, which had previously been behind the funnel, was moved forward, and a waist high iron steering shelter added to give the skipper some comfort. She went back to work outside Sharpness, towing sailing vessels through the dangerous stretches of the Severn Estuary to the mouth of the river Wye and back again.
Around 1907, the Canal Company decided to compete on the River Severn upstream of Gloucester to Worcester. In 1909 "Mayflower" was again altered when the funnel was arranged to hinge down (counterbalanced with large weights which can still be seen) to enable her to pass under the fixed bridges on this stretch of water. She was now capable of working on every part of the navigation from Worcester to Chepstow, and because of this, became regarded as the training tug in the canal's fleet, which she continued to be until the end of her working life.
In 1922, she was again altered when the entire deck was raised by which meant that the area beneath the deck at the stern could become another cabin albeit with very low headroom. At the same time the bulwarks were cut away down most of each side and replaced with stanchions and chains; this reflected the increased barge traffic on the canal, allowing the crew to step onto laden barges easily.
In the late 1930s, a wooden wheelhouse replaced the steering shelter, and some time after this the bulwarks were replaced. In 1948 the British Waterways Board took control of the canal and made efforts to modernise the tug fleet. All the tugs were either scrapped or had diesel engines installed, except "Mayflower", as she was too old to be worth bothering with. She was given the job of 'mudding tug' – towing the mud hopper barges filled by the canal dredger to the discharge point. Sometimes she was needed to turn ships at Sharpness Docks and assist them in the entrance lock. In 1962—1963, when the winter was so cold that the canal froze and the diesel tugs had difficulty in working, "Mayflower" once again took on ship-towing work in the canal. Finally, British Waterways sold "Mayflower" for scrap in 1967.
She was saved from being cut up for scrap metal by Mr. Anthony H Barrett who at the time was setting out in his business career and regularly attended auction sales throughout the UK. Mayflower had been purchased by an auction ring which Mr. Barrett had to join if he stood any chance of acquiring the tug and fortunately it was Mr. Barrett who was the highest bidder in that 'ring' and he purchased the tug for a sum of £400 initially borrowing the money to pay for her from his cousin, Mr. George Billingham. A consortium was then formed to fund the purchase, and Mr. Barrett was joined by the late Mr. Kevin Donaghy and Mr. Len Sanford two Walsall engineers. All three men took a third share in Mayflower and agreed to share the expenses of keeping her moored at Gloucester Docks. Mr. Barrett who was around 20 yrs old at the time was already involved in the restoration of vintage Rolls Royce motors and it was he that saw the value in preserving Mayflower for posterity! Mr. Barrett wrote to many people and organisations including Prince Charles who was going through his investiture at that time, in his endeavour to find assistance in preserving the vessel, unfortunately to no avail. In the late seventies the two other investors pulled out after some vandals went aboard in the night and opened the 'water cocks' in effect scuttling the old girl, she went to the bottom of the dock. This tragic event cost the consortium in excess of £1400 to re-float the old boat (relatively, a lot of money at the time to find at short notice for three struggling entrepreneurs with young families to maintain). Mr. Barrett soldiered on alone until 1981 when because of a bit of a financial crisis he sadly and reluctantly decided he too must pull out and let someone else take over as custodian of this wonderful example of British engineering and see to her needs. Mr. Barrett and the two other men had done their very best to maintain the tug often under very difficult circumstances in the fourteen years they were custodians of her. It is in no small part due to their earnest intervention that she still exists, had it not been for their earlier efforts Mayflower would certainly not have survived to be enjoyed and appreciated as she is today. In 1981 she was offered for auction by Charles Phillips Auctioneers from outside Mr. Barrett's home Sneyd Farm Essington, this is when she was purchased by Bristol Museums & Art Gallery and towed back to her birthplace.
Over the next six years "Mayflower" was restored to working order by a team of volunteers, and she steamed again in 1987. Early in 1988, she steamed back to Gloucester on a courtesy visit.
"Mayflower" regularly steams during the summer months carrying visitors on trips in Bristol Harbour. She marked her 150th anniversary in May 2011.

After Secondary School, she took up typing and started working as a sales representative and later on as Assistant PR for a well known Batik factory and Tourist Center in Gombak run by the Chong family. It was the beginning of her journey as the bread winner of her family.
Roy & Fran.
Royston Sta Maria and Francissca Peter, better known as ‘Roy & Fran’ was an unbeatable duo act in the 1980s. They were at times, dubbed ‘The Carpenters’ of Malaysia. The pairing brought them immense popularity among Malaysians. Their natural chemistry and soothing voices were admired by many, culminating in the release of two LPS. They came from a musically talented family, with their own family members dabbling in music at some point in their lives. Roy’s dad, Clive was part of a singing group called Clive & The Boys. Fran, on the other hand has a sister, Bibiana, who released an album in the 1980s and her brother Michael, is making waves in the US with his debut album.
Right from their schooling days, both were active in the school choir and their interest in music started from a very early age. It was Malaysian pianist and composer, Michael Veerapen who suggested that Fran team up with Roy and they teamed up in 1979, when she was only 17.
They were performing every night in Merlin Hotel in KL during the 1980s when S. Atan, a renowned music producer discovered them. Then EMI, a record company in Malaysia, with the urging from local music writers and critics, signed them on and the marketing department people were immediately planning the duo’s debut album, "Siapa Dia Sebelum Daku" in 1982.
Roy and Fran then moved on to Genting Highlands, Kuantan and Johor Bahru. Fran had a break when Andy Williams sang at the Highlands resort and she was the Opening Act. During that time, Roy & Fran were performing at the Genting Highlands Resort Lounge and Bar.
After the success of the first LP, this was followed by "Bersama Pertemuan Ini" in 1983. However after the success of the second album, Fran decided to go separate ways and develop a solo career.
Career.
Fran has lent her voice to numerous TV commercials: ‘Embracing Proton’ (she was the first "Proton Girl"); on stage at the National Grand Parade she led the launch of the first Malaysian car; Malaysia Airlines (the National Carrier) with the theme ‘To Know Malaysia is to Love Malaysia’ which was later used as a song for Tourism Malaysia, McDonald’s, Nescafe, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Courts Mammoth, Carlsberg, Honda and others.
In 1984, Fran was chosen as the first and only Anti-Dadah Campaign girl for more than a year (Malaysian Anti-Drug Spokesperson). Her campaign poster was displayed in every police station in the country. The theme song for the campaign was "Si Mata Merah" from her first solo album "Komputer Muzik" and part of the proceeds for the sale of the song went to the Anti-Dadah campaign.
1986 saw her winning in the first Anugerah Juara Lagu. She was awarded for the song "Sekadar Di Pinggiran" and after that she just kept soaring and more local awards.
In 1987, she was the first Malaysian artist to win the International Award for "Best Song" at the 'Asean Song Festival' held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She is also known nationwide for her rendition of Malaysia's second national anthem "Setia".
Fran was always known to be Malaysia's darling - the celebrity who stayed away from cheap publicity or controversies. However, in 1987 her album "Kau Bintangku" was almost banned as the album cover had her wearing a crucifix. Instigated by a small group of people who did not like the fact that a non-Malay was popular with many Malay-muslim fans in Malaysia, they tried to get the album banned but Warner Music decided to digitally touch up the album cover and put it back on the shelves. Consequently, the album went Platinum.
In 1990, with five platinum discs, two gold discs and numerous awards to her name, Francissca began working in the United States. During her two years in Los Angeles, Fran worked with artists including jazz fusion pianist Brian Simpson, Sam Simms, Michael Winans of the gospel group The Winans, Vassal Benford, Kirk Whalum, Scott Maio and Himalaya. She also appeared as guest vocalist on jazz saxophonist Cal Bennett's album "Local Hero" singing "Liberian Girl". "Jazziz Magazine" and "Bre Magazine" in the USA called her vocals "A Lush Standout, An Ingenious Outing and the Most Outstanding Track".
In 2000, Fran starred in the musical "The King and I" with The Hong Kong singers. She played the role of Lady Thiang. The musical was directed by Ian Robinson and conducted by Julian Grant, one of Britain's leading opera composers. It was produced by Rupert McCowan. "The King and I" played to sell-out audiences throughout its 9-day run at The Hong Kong City Hall.
Fran has worked with numerous musicians in London including Peter Churchill, Mark Fletcher, Tim Wells and David Lim of Yokohama Sinners. While she has been successful as a commercial artiste, she is also always remembered in Malaysia as the first jazz vocalist who helped launch "All That Jazz", the first ever jazz club in Malaysia. She has performed worldwide in numerous cities while on the local front, has worked with the likes of jazz maestros Michael Veerapen, Leonard Yeap, Lewis Pragasam, Jeremy Koay, Khairil, Wan, Gary Gideon, Jose Thomas, Dato’ Mokhzani, Greg Lyons, the late Terry Thaddeus, Tony Makarome Yue, David Gomes, Eric Li, Steve Thornton, Mac Chew and others.

"Keunggulan Francissca Peter" (The Very Best of Francissca Peter), a 37 song compilation album, was released in late January 2010.
In 2009, Fran saw the end of a love that she thought would last a lifetime, her marriage. Heartbreaking as it was for her, she accepted it gracefully and let him go. The news of her separation and final breakup was kept from the public for many years until she announced it only during her "Keunggulan 33 Tahun Francissca Peter Concert" in 2011 so that all the Press who were present would be on one page.
In June 2010, Warner released a love-duets album "Sukma Rindu". Fran and Royston Sta Maria had two never-before released duets in the album titled "Manusia" and "Gunung Payung" plus a romantic duet with William Clark titled "Cinta Abadi".

869 Sanriku earthquake

The and associated tsunami struck the area around Sendai in the northern part of Honshu on 9 July 869 (26th day of 5th month,
11th year of Jōgan). The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 8.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale. However, it is likely that the moment magnitude rating may have been similar to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami at around 9.0. The tsunami caused widespread flooding of the Sendai plain, with sand deposits being found up to from the coast.
Name.
In Japan this earthquake is commonly called "Jogan Jishin（貞観地震）". Jōgan is the Japanese era name for the period from 859 to 877 AD. But during the era other large earthquakes also occurred in Japan, so the name of the geographic epicenter and the anno domini year number when the quake occurred are sometimes added. Sanriku in this context is a name roughly corresponding to the Pacific front northeastern coastal area of Honshu island.
The Japanese history text, "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" which was compiled in 901, recorded the 869 earthquake and tsunami of Mutsu Province.
Description in public archives.
Although this earthquake occurred in the frontier region of the ancient Japanese Empire based at Kyoto, a short and precise official record of this catastrophe was left. The description in "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" is the following.
Tectonic setting.
The northern part of Honshu lies above the convergent boundary between the over-riding Okhotsk Plate (a proposed microplate within the North American Plate) and the subducting Pacific Plate. This boundary has been associated with a series of large historical earthquakes, originating either from rupture along the plate interface or from deformation within either the over-riding or subducting plates, many of them triggering a destructive tsunami, such as the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake.
Damage.
In the area which the earthquake struck, the Imperial Court of Japan battled with an indigenous people of the Tōhoku region, Emishi, at that time. According to "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku", around 1000 people were killed by the tsunami.
Despite a lack of reliable sources, there are legends about the earthquake from Tōhoku region to Bōsō Peninsula.
The tsunami caused extensive flooding of the Sendai plain, destroying the town of Tagajō. Archaeological investigations have identified the remains of 8th and 9th century buildings beneath the town, covered by sediments dated to the middle of the 10th century.
Characteristics.
Earthquake.
The estimated magnitude of the earthquake as 8.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale, has been taken from modelling of the tsunami. A source area of long by wide with a displacement of is consistent with the observed distribution and degree of flooding. Analysis of the tsunami deposits associated with the 2011 earthquake suggests that the extent of sand deposition in the earlier events underestimated the degree of inundation. A muddy deposit was found to extend half as far again as the sand sheet. As the topography and cultivation of the Sendai plain has not changed significantly since 869, it has been proposed that the sources of the 2011 and 869 tsunamis were of comparable size, suggesting that the magnitude of the 869 earthquake has been severely underestimated. Thus the magnitude of this quake may have been as high as 9.0.
Tsunami.
The extent of flooding caused by the tsunami of the Sendai plain has been mapped using dated deposits of sand. The tsunami flooded at least inland. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami.
Predicted earthquake hazard.
Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the Sendai plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed.
As for the other two large tsunamis recognized before the 869 tsunami, one was estimated to have occurred between about 1000 BC and 500 BC and the other around 1 AD. In 2007 the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1–8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years.
The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was somewhat larger than the predicted event, but occurred in the same area as the 869 earthquake and caused major flooding in the Sendai area.

George Blake (athlete)

George Bernard Blake (4 September 1878 – 6 February 1946) was an Australian sportsman who competed in the 1906 Intercalated Games and 1908 Summer Olympics as a long distance runner. He also played Australian rules football with St Kilda and Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Biography.
Blake, the son of Irish immigrants, had 10 siblings. One of them, Tom Blake, was also a league footballer and distance runner of note.
In 1897, George Blake made three appearances for St Kilda, who were playing in the inaugural VFL season. He played three more games in 1898 and then, due to his running career, had to wait five years for his seventh and final league game with St Kilda. He returned in 1905 to play one more game, this time at Carlton.
A national record holder for the 10 miles, Blake was one of Australia's leading long distance runners of the early 1900s and was a member of the East Melbourne Harriers Athletic Club. He went to Auckland in 1901 for the Australasian Championships and finished second in the three miles, but was the first placed Australian.
He was one of just four Australians to go to Athens in 1906 for the Olympics. His first event was the Men's 1,500 metres where he finished far back in his heat and missed the final. The longer distances were more to his liking and in the Men's 5 mile race he placed sixth out of 28 competitors.
Blake's best performance of the 1906 Games was in the Men's Marathon, where he was the only athlete from the southern hemisphere to compete. He was leading the race at the 24 km mark, by a distance of 1200 metres, but succumbed to cramp. Blake was still able to finish the race and finished sixth, in a time of three hours, nine minutes and thirty five seconds. He was involved in a sprint for the finish with Greece's Ioannis Alepous, who beat him to the line by ten seconds. His placing was not bettered by an Australian at an Olympic Games until Robert de Castella finished fifth in 1984.
Blake made the long journey to Europe again two years later to participate in the London Olympics, this time competing for Australasia. He narrowly missed out on making the Men's 5 Mile final after finishing third in his heat and only the top two qualified. In the marathon he couldn't repeats his performance from Athens and didn't finish the race. He could however feel aggrieved as his retirement after five and a half miles was due to an injury sustained when the bicycle riding attendant collided with him while giving out refreshments.

Magnus Stiernstråle

Magnus Stiernstråle (died December 18, 1738) was a Swedish military colonel, and was most likely from Livonia. 
Stiernstråle became captain of the Hämeenlinna infantry in 1648. When the Great Northern War erupted in 1700, he was lieutenant colonel and commander of the Ivangorod Fortress, which he had to give up on August 16, 1704. In 1710 he became a colonel in Vyborg and Commandant of the Vyborg Fortress, which was fitted with a garrison of only 4 000. In March, it was attacked by a numerically superior Russian force under General Fyodor Apraksin.
At first, the Russians, who had not brought any real siege artillery, had little success. Soon, however, when Czar Peter I himself arrived on May 10 with reinforcements and supplies, they gained the upper hand. From this time, they were besieged in a position more and more desperate, and in vain waited for rescue from the Finnish side. Since the city walls to a large extent been destroyed and the crew weakened by disease and suffering, Stiernstråle surrendered on June 13, 1710. Although he was the commander of the defense forces, and much of the bourgeoisie were taken as prisoners to Russia, Stiernstråle was taken to Pinsgorod, from where he first after peace returned in 1721. He was promoted to Major General in 1721, and in 1723 received command of the Savo Regiment.

Raskamboni Movement

The Raskamboni Movement (alt. Raskamboni Front) is a paramilitary group active in southern Somalia. It is led by Sheikh Ahmed Madobe. Raskamboni's members are opposed to the radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab.
History.
The group has been involved in numerous armed clashes with al-Shabab militiamen. The Raskamboni engaged al-Shabab militiamen on March 13, 2011 in the village of Dif. The movement claimed to have destroyed a number of Al-Shabaab military vehicles in the fighting, which left at least 5 dead.
On April 3, 2011, the Raskamboni movement, in conjunction with Transitional Federal Government forces and the Kenyan Air Force, captured the border town Dhobley from Al-Shabab.
In July 2012, it was reported that they staged a rescue operation to free four kidnapped aid workers from the Norwegian Refugee Council.
In September 2012, a reconstituted Somali National Army assisted by AMISOM troops and Raskamboni militia reportedly re-captured Kismayo from the Al-Shabaab insurgents during the Battle of Kismayo (2012).
In February 2014, Al-Shabaab militants launched a string of attacks in Kismayo targeting Raskamboni members, including an IED that tore through a vehicle carrying the group's members and killed several civilians. On 19 February, Raskamboni militants began an intensive search operation in the city after the group's security chief, Isse Kamboni, was shot dead by one of his bodyguards, a former Al-Shabaab member. According to eye-witnesses, Ras Kamboni subsequently started hunting down Al-Shabaab suspects. Many Raskomboni fighters were seen patrolling the streets, and more than 150 civilians were detained at the local police stations in connection with Isse's assassination. Seven civilian deaths were also reported during the clampdown with some accusing the militia of using the clampdown as an excuse to stifle dissent. Hundreds of elders and businessmen had earlier fled the city.

Introduction.
The Gothic style, it is an artistic style of the 15th and 16th centuries. A visible style in that epoch's buildings, mostly of religious aspect, though very few ones are kept in foot as they were. The great majority of those centuries' buildings have been deteriorating with the time and have been reconstructed, consequently, they do not support the same Gothic essence any more. Nevertheless, in buildings like Saint Anthon's church, even having being reconstructed, it is possible to observe some Gothic features as the rib vaults, the pointed arches.
History.
Created at the end of the 15th century over a plot where 300 years before was a warehouse of merchandise. Considered like asset of cultural interest after 17 July 1984, with the category "National Historic-Artistic Monument".
In 1300 Diego López de Haro gave the municipal charter. The river an the plot ere incorporated to the new village called Bilbao. In 1334 Alfonso XI of Castile ordered to build a fortress and wall that were used like a dike against the flood. This was discovered in 2002 by an archaeological excavation.
Some time later this two buildings were replaced by one church dedicated to Saint Anton Abbot. This church was consecrated in 1433. In that moment the church only has one nave with a rectangular floor and a vaulted roof. Nowadays we can see the old foundations of that church near the old wall of Bilbao.
In 1478 they start a new project to increase the church, because it was very small and the congregation of faithful people was increasing. This enlargement, in Gothic style, was finished in the first part of the 16th century.
Throughout history this church has suffered a lot of damages and was closed two times. The main source of damage was the Nervión river because the church is very close to it. A lot of flooding happened during the history and a part of the furniture inside was affected by it. The last flood was in 1983 and it affected the church; it destroyed furniture, drag doors and railings.
During the war the bombing and fire the church suffer a lot of damages. Especially during the Carlist war. Caused by this war the church had to close because it was used like warehouse of management. The second time when Saint Anton had to close was in 1881. This was caused by the tumbledown state of the church. This restoration done by Sabino Goikoetxea was very polemic because he change a lot of original things.
Gothic art in Biscay.
Gothic art was created in France in the 13th century, but it is not until the 14th century when it was introduced in Biscay, due to the poverty. In the 14th century the population and the economy grew, carrying the Gothic into Biscay.
The ogival art or Gothic art was born in France, and it was extended to the rest of Europe. In Spain the ogival architecture is used a half century later than in France. As the French influence entered by Navarre, it avoided the Basque Country, so it was even later when it came to Biscay. Most of the buildings are not really big, even if we can find Santiago's cathedral in Bilbao or Andra Mari of Lekeitio.
The Gothic architecture, with its ogival arches (that is why it is also called ogival architecture), was what they needed in Biscay. This arches needed an exterior backing, which began in the wall. The concentric arches became peaked and ogival, instead of the half-pointed arches. They were adorned with vegetal, zoomorphic or human representations. The vaults began being as simple-ribbed but finally they were used terceletes.
Most of the buildings were begun in the 14th century, but only Santiago's cathedral was ended then. The rest were consecrated between the 15th and 16th centuries.
The Biscay Gothic lost the spirit of the International Gothic: they were not monumental buildings with windows which played with the light creating a mystical aura inside, but small buildings, becoming that a characteristic of the local Gothic.
Andra Mari of Guernica, Getxo, Orduña, Gueñes, Erandio, Galdakao, Portugalete and Lekeitio, Santa Eufemia of Bermeo, Santiago's Cathedral, Basilica of Begoña, San Vicente and San Anton of Bilbao and San Severino of Balmaseda have to be named as important buildings of the Gothic of Biscay.
Chapels of San Antón.
The Church of San Antón contains three chapels:
Chapel of Provost.
It is the first and widest chapels that the Church of San Antón possesses. Built in 1530 this chapel is an example of the late Gothic style which can be seen in other nearby construction like Begoña, La encarnación, San Vicente of Abando and San Pedro of Deusto. There is a big ogival arch at the entrance of the chapel. This arch is closed by a grille that was forged in Bilbao. At the top of the entrance it is located this chapels founder’s coat of arms: the Lezama-Leguizamón family’s coat of arms. In the past there was a passageway that linked this chapel and Lezama-Leguizamón family’s tower house. There is a stained glass window located in the front wall.
The chapel held two altarpieces. One of the altarpieces is dedicated to Santa Ana and the other is dedicated to Virgen de la Consolación. At present the chapel contains an altar that contains a wood carved sculpture of Inmaculada and some paintings.
There is also a silver lamp with the following inscription carved on it: "Esta lámpara dieron a su capilla de Santa Ana, Doña María de Leguizamón y Don Domingo de Isasi-Leguizamón. 1621"
Chapel of Piety.
The Chapel of Piety is smaller than the Chapel of Provost but bigger than the Chapel of San Roque. It possesses similar attributes of those present in the Chapel of Provost. It has a Gothic structure in the entrance arch, rib vault on the ceilings and stained glass windows.
The grille closing this chapel is older than the grille closing the Chapel of Provost. It is present in the top part of this grille the coat of arms of the Recalde family alongside with details of The Passion.
The intermediate frieze contains the following inscription written in Latin: "O Mater Dei, memento mei Iesu". It could be translated as "Oh mother of god, remember us before Jesus".
In 1919 the Chapel of Provost and the Chapel of Piety were united with a Gothic arch to enlarge the communion rail.
Chapel of San Roque.
It's the smallest chapel out of the three that the church of San Anton possess. This chapel is composed by a rib vault and a small blinded Gothic window in the right wall. It was the first entrance of the church.
When the new main front was built the Ibiceta family which had their family sepulchre in the chapel decided to transform it to an artistic mausoleum with prayerful sculptures and diverse decorative elements. The chapel contains a round-headed arch sustained by Corinthians columns.
At present days there are present in this chapel the sculpture of San Roque above the sepulture and the sculptures of Santa Lucia and San Sebastian flanking it.
Façade of Renaissance.
The Saint Anthon church, in Bilbao, contains a typical front, not of the own and general style of the church, which is the Gothic, but of the Renaissance style born in the 16th century. This owes to the repeated reforms to which the church has been submitted, and every reform has contributed something new and characteristic of that epoch.
To begin with, it is necessary to emphasize that there exist features that belong neither to the Renaissance nor to the Gothic. Example of it we have the arches of the entry. These arches are called round arches and are typical of the Romanesque style; and at the door there is another type of arch that was used at the end of the 15th century.
A really Gothic and visible element from any point of view, are the rib vaults, that are in the whole church, so much in as externally, though in this paragraph we indicate only the ones outside.
In the front we find the front of the church, a front that goes from the sides of the door up to being over it. The mentioned front was built in the year 1548, a generous front in proportions and rich in all the decorative resources of the Renaissance. Around the arch we notice small sculptures of low relief,with the form of heads, symbol of the anthropocentrism that dominated the Renaissance epoch. The great majority of the heads contain wings of angels behind them; and just in the middle of all, in the central keystone, we notice a slightly bigger sculpture than the others, with the form of a shield, and with the year 1548 recorded in it, as a signature of the builder.
In every side of the door we can see another typical example of the Renaissance, which was the use of Corinthian columns. Those which appear in this church are of small size in comparison with other buildings, but they support all their essence: a Corinthian capital with its rectangular annulet and abacus and its acanthus' leaves, some coiled forming "caulículos". The shaft we find it in grooved style and the end of the shaft and the foot we can see it with sculptural drawings of plants (basically leaves) and human representations.
And to finish with the front, as we can observe in this image,we find two niches, one to each side of the door, which until 1892 were empty, and that from that year's reform, the sculptures of Saint Pedro and Saint Paul went to occupy them.
The niches contain scallops, which are the space of the niche itself, with representations that venerate what is inside the niche. In this case we also find in the scallop two little angels holding a medallion with the head of another human being.
All these elements (niches, angels, scallops, medallions, Corinthian columns) are representative elements of the Renaissance style of the 15th and 16th centuries; all of them have as canon to represent the beauty and the naturalism, and all of them shape the great front of the Saint Anthon church of Bilbao.
Belfry Tower.
In 1774 the construction of the Belfry Tower began by Gabriel de Capelastegui. This one had to substitute the former one. The tower has a quadrangular body that raises near the central roof. Above it we can find the belfry crowned by a dome and a lantern, and with aunctions in the weathercock. It has a shining Baroque dieciochesco style, being one of the best examples of the whole Basque Country. The weathercock dates back of in 1775, concretely it was made in December 7 of the same year.
We get to the belfry going up the 106 limestone stairs and its banister, which has a surprising geometric precision. From the base to the lantern there are 32 wooden steps, that need to be repaired.
Even if from the four eyes of the tower you can have wonderful panoramics, it is true that from the lantern they enlarge. That is why, doting it of a better and more secure access would be convenient, to allow more people to see what probably is the best view of the city.
The outside watch was ubicated in this lantern, with bronze sphere and golden numbers, it was situated between the two coats of arms made of bronze in the consulate balcony, in front of the Mercado de la Ribera.
The bell, substituted the one before, The Circumcision of the Lord, which fell on 29 June 1779. The actual one has the following inscription: "IHS. San Antonio Abad. Ora pro nobis, Antonio de la Hoza me Hizo. 1829."
The last contributions date from 1902: the new portic in front of the Ronda street, the new sacristy and the large parroquial dependences.
The construction of the portic and the frontages which run until the bridge are a good decision of its architect, Enrique Epalza, for making them in Isabelline Gothic, avoiding like this to oppose to the temples style.

Australian Capital Territory general election, 2012

Elections to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly occurred on Saturday, 20 October 2012. The 11-year incumbent Labor Party, led by Chief Minister Katy Gallagher, won a fourth term over the main opposition Liberal Party, led by opposition leader Zed Seselja.
Candidates are elected to fill all 17 Legislative Assembly seats in the unicameral parliament which consists of three multi-member electorates, Brindabella (five seats), Ginninderra (five seats) and Molonglo (seven seats), using a proportional representation single transferable vote method known as the Hare-Clark system.
Background.
The incumbent centre-left Australian Labor Party led by Chief Minister Katy Gallagher attempted to win re-election for a historic fourth term after 11 years in government in the 17-member unicameral ACT Legislative Assembly. Labor led by Jon Stanhope came to power as a minority government at the 2001 election with the support of the Greens and Democrats who held the balance of power. The 2004 election resulted in a historic majority government for Labor, and represented the first time the ACT had elected a majority government. Labor again formed a minority government after the 2008 election resulted in a Green balance of power – Labor 7 seats (37.4%), Liberal 6 seats (31.6%), Greens 4 seats (15.6%). Stanhope resigned as Chief Minister and Labor leader on 12 May 2011, and was replaced by his deputy, Katy Gallagher.
The 1989 election saw the start of self-governance in the ACT. Elections see all members of the unicameral Assembly face re-election, with members being elected by the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation. The Assembly is divided into three electorates: five-member Brindabella (including Tuggeranong and parts of the Woden Valley) and Ginninderra (including Belconnen and suburbs) and seven-member Molonglo (including North Canberra, South Canberra, Gungahlin, Weston Creek, and the remainder of the Woden Valley). Election dates are set in statute with four-year fixed terms.
Candidates.
Nine political parties were registered with the ACT Electoral Office as eligible for the October 2012 election. 
Three further organisations—Pirate Party Australia, Australian Democrats and No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics—were not registered as political parties in the ACT, however had stated they intended to nominate candidates to be listed on ballot papers as independents.
Brindabella.
Five seats were up for election. The Labor Party was defending two seats. The Liberal Party was defending two seats. The Australian Greens were defending one seat. 
Ginninderra.
Five seats were up for election. The Labor Party was defending two seats. The Liberal Party was defending two seats. The Australian Greens were defending one seat.
Molonglo.
Seven seats were up for election. The Labor Party was defending three seats. The Liberal Party was defending two seats. The Australian Greens were defending two seats.
Results.
Final distribution of seats.
After the distribution of preferences neither of the two major parties had won sufficient number of seats to form government in their own right and would need to form a minority government with an alliance with the sole Greens representative Shane Rattenbury. After a week of negotiations Shane Rattenburry formally supported the Labor party to form a minority government.

Military-digital complex

The military-digital complex (MDC) is the militarization of Cyber Operations by governments and corporations, often through monetary relationships between computer programmers in private companies and the military to combat the threat of cyber terrorism and warfare. Cyber operations since 2000 have increased dramatically, with the recent branch of the US Strategic Command the United States Cyber Command. Cyber operations has been defined by the Washington Post as,
As cyber attacks become an increasingly common threat to the security of civilians and highly classified governmental information, a need to combat the threat by means of Computer network operations and Computer Network Defense have arisen. It is important to note however that protection is only one component of the Military-digital complex and that the use of Information Warfare within the complex can be used to achieve military operations and an upper-hand in economic exploits.
The Military-digital complex contains many components which align it succinctly to its industrial counterpart, for example the use of defense contractors. Although hired Contractors may not be explicitly named as such they still expose the complex to complications such as the principal agent problem and consequently moral hazard. The MDC is seen as a progression as nations move globally towards cyberwarfare, indeed the cyber war is increasingly being acknowledged as the "fifth domain of warfare"
The MDC is a necessity for governmental bodies in order to maintain high standards within their cyber army, for example the USA boasts over "143 private companies involved in top secret cyber operations programs", however James Gosler a government specialist in cyber security indicates that the USA have a severe shortage of government cybersecurity specialists
History.
Technology has always been utilized for warfare since the dawn of man. Neolithic tools such as daggers were used as weaponry and clan rivalry long before recorded history. The bronze age and iron age saw technological improvements namely in the advancements of weaponry and subsequently the arrival of complex industries. It was not until the late 19th and early 20th Century that weaponry advanced in leaps and bounds to the armaments mankind witnesses today, however even then industry was relatively independent of the government and military. The Great war and World War II were two important factors that led to the consequent military-industrial complex. Eric Hobsbawm in his book "Age of Extremes" outlines how categorically countries like Japan, USA and Russia had to develop their own military industry to support their militaristic efforts, creating a complex whereby the economies then straddled on this arms industry. Consequently the procurement of missiles, ballistics, nuclear weapons, destroyers and submarines shows a marked difference between the ancient acquisitions of countries.
At the dawn on the 21st Century, the world has seen an emergence of digital equipment in the use of warfare, spanning from satellite surveillance systems all the way to dedicated agencies such as United States Cyber Command fully equipped with thousands of professionals manning computers on a 24/365 basis in order to prevent a cyber attack.
The use of computers has long been an essential tool in warfare, however as warfare moves from the traditional frontiers of land, sea, air and space to "cyber space" the use of computers is becoming not only essential but vital. Gregory Rattray, author of "Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace", explains how the history of warfare in the information age is far reaching and is well beyond military operation including financial crime and economic espionage. The history of this cyber warfare shows that it crosses global boundaries and encompasses political agendas, attacks on the USA such as Titan Rain show an attack from networks and computers situated in China for example. As the age of digital warfare progressed it has become evident that human reliance on technological equipment to monitor essential utilities such as our electricity grids has proven cataclysmic. As the threat became increasingly relevant, the emergence of big corporate players on the MDC scene including names such as Symantec, McAfee and interestingly traditional defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, as the cyber threat grows so does mankind's reliance on corporate players such as the aforementioned, creating an iron trinagle among government, military and these global security corporations.

Liberalisme (anthology)

Liberalisme: Politisk frihet fra John Locke til Amartya Sen () is a 2009 Norwegian language anthology edited by Lars Svendsen. The book focuses on the history of liberalism and libertarianism in general, and contains a sample of liberal thinkers from John Locke to Amartya Sen. It was published by Universitetsforlaget with financial support from Civita and Fritt Ord. The book received mixed reviews by critics.
Background.
Svendsen was 39 years old at the time of publication, teaching philosophy at the University of Bergen. In the Spring of 2007, Civita hosted a debate on the content in the word "Liberalism". It took place at a public breakfast meeting at a café in Oslo.
The anthology was published two years later, in May 2009, also at a breakfast meeting. Norwegian politicians and writers were invited to the debate, among them Cathrine Holst, Henrik Syse and Ove Vanebo.
In a 2009 interview with the Norwegian newspaper "Klassekampen", Svendsen stated that he hoped the book would become "Civita's Red Book".
Content.
The anthology contains entries for various liberal thinkers, among them John Locke, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Mary Wollstonecraft, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, Robert Nozick and Amartya Sen. Each entry consists of a short biography of the thinker, as well as a translated work. Svendsen states in the foreword of the book that he tried to select works that had not been translated to Norwegian before.
Reception.
The book received much lukewarm criticism from reviewers, many of whom were arguing that the selected persons in the anthology did not fit together. Eirik Høyer Leivestad, reviewing for "Bergens Tidende", supported this view, and stated that "crazy" minarchist libertarians like Ludwig von Mises, Robert Nozick and Friedrich Hayek did not belong in a book with "tempered" liberal thinkers like John Locke, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.
Professor at the University of Oslo, Trond Berg Eriksen, also criticised the anthology for being contradictory, and labelled it "not a peaceful cemetery" in his review in "Morgenbladet". He also criticised Svendsen for leaving out prolific liberal thinkers such as Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Raymond Aron, Milton Friedman and Quentin Skinner.

RAF Gaza

RAF Gaza was a Second World War RAF airfield in the present day Gaza Strip, probably on the site of Karni crossing.
History.
During the Second World War RAF Gaza was used by a number of RAF squadrons, including 33, 45, 127, 208, 318 and 451 Squadrons. No.2 Air Crew Officers School was based on the airfield, and the Greek Training Flight was also based there from 1941-1942. The airfield was used as the Middle East ammunition depot from July to September 1942. It was in use by 1941, and may have first been used earlier. RAF Gaza was on the site of present-day Karni crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Although no remains of the airfield itself are visible today, the British concrete road linking the airfield with the ammunition storage areas (located about 6 km south of the airfield, still visible today) is visible and in good shape.

Frederick William, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

Frederick William I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (28 March 1675 – 31 July 1713) was the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin portion of the duchy of Mecklenburg from 1692 until 1713.
Frederick William was the eldest son of Prince Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow, and Christine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg (1653–1722). He was a nephew of the childless Duke Christian Ludwig I of Mecklenburg. Frederick Wiliam succeeded his uncle on 21 June 1692 as regent of the Schwerin portion of the duchy of Mecklenburg. After the extinction of the Mecklenburg-Güstrow line of the dynasty with the death of Duke Gustav Adolph in 1695, Frederick William became embroiled in a violent succession dispute with his uncle Adolf Frederick II that escalated quickly. It brought the country to the brink of civil war and was settled only through the intervention of foreign powers. The dispute was ended in 1701 by the Hamburg Compromise. Mecklenburg was again split into two parts with limited autonomy. The two sub-principalities, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin, existed until 1918. The Compromise also introduced the right of succession of the first-born to the dynasty.
In 1708, Frederick William introduced the "Consumption and Tax Statute" to overcome the fiscal consequences of the Thirty Years' War and the Great Northern War. In addition to the taxation of knights and the clergy, this law included the abolition of serfdom, freeing farmers from dependence on their landlords. The former peasants could lease their land and forced labor was to be replaced by work for a salary. This created a sharp conflict between the duke and the landed estates.
Frederick William married Sophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel on 2 January 1704 in Kassel. She was a daughter of Count Charles I of Hesse-Kassel. The couple had no children.
Frederick William had numerous mistresses, with whom he had at least nine children, including:
A lady named Frederika Wilhelmina was born 1702 in Boitzenburg and died 1748 in Schwerin. In 1719, she married 1719 Hermann Christian von Wolffradt (died in 1723 in Dömitz)). She was a mistress of Duke Karl Leopold of Mecklenburg. Whether she was an illegitimate daughter of Frederick William is a point of controversy in the historical literature. 
Frederick William died in Mainz on 31 July 1713 on his return from Schlangenbad. His wife Sofia Charlotte took up her dower in Bützow, where she died. She was buried beside her husband in the crypt of the newly built Schelfkirche St. Nikolai in Schwerin.

Shinmen Munisai

, also called Hirata Munisai, was a martial artist, expert in using the sword and the jutte. He was also the father of the samurai named Miyamoto Musashi. He was the son of Hirata Shōgen 平田将監, a vassal of Shinmen Iga no Kami, the lord of Takayama Castle in the Yoshino district of Mimasaka Province. Munisai was relied upon by Lord Shinmen Sokan,the head of the Shinmen clan and so was allowed to use the Shinmen name. He was one of the few to have obtained the title of "Unrivaled Under The Sun", title offered to him by the Shogun Ashikaga.
Biography.
Munisai's birth date.
Because of the uncertainty centering on Munisai (when he died, whether he was truly Musashi's father, etc.), Musashi's mother is known with even less confidence. Here are a few possibilities:
Duel against the Yoshioka.
Sometime after Ashikaga Yoshiteru became the Shogun, he started in Kyoto a comparison duel between Munisai, who was still called Hirata at the time, and the founder of the Yoshioka-ryū school of sword-fighting: Yoshioka Kenpo (who was also the sword instructor of the Ashikaga). Kenpo won the first match, while Munisai won the other two. This event later started a feud between Munisai's son Miyamoto Musashi and the following generation of the Yoshioka family. Munisai having won the match, the shogun gave him the title of "Unrivaled Under The Sun".
Recruited by the Shinmen clan.
Having heard about Munisai, the head of the Shinmen clan, Shinmen Sokan, recruited Munisai as instructor of his troops. During these years at Sokan's services, Munisai married a woman named Yoshiko, who gave him two children: a girl, Ogin, and a boy, Takezo (who would later be known as Miyamoto Musashi). More or less five years later, he divorced with Yoshiko, keeping custody of his children, forbidding Takezo to go and search for his mother.
In 1589, for unknown reasons, Sokan ordered Munisai to kill his student Honiden Gekinosuke. After this event, he started training Takezo in the ways of the sword and of the jutte, but it didn't last long since the inhabitants of Miyamoto village, displeased with Gekinosuke's death, forced him to move away in the village of Kawakami. 
He died in 1592, surely due to the amount of stress caused by the fact that many swordsmen wanted to claim his title afterwards.

Coronation of the Nepalese monarch

The Coronation of the Nepalese monarch was a Hindu religious ceremony in which the King of Nepal was crowned. The Kingdom of Nepal was the last Hindu monarchy in the world at the time of its dissolution and replacement with the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.
Preparations.
The coronation would happen on a date selected by court astronomers for its auspiciousness. On the chosen day, the new King would have eight different types of clay ceremoniously applied to parts of his body. He would then bathe in holy water before being sprinkled with a mixture of butter, milk, curd and honey by a representative of the four traditional Hindu castes - a Brahman, a warrior, a merchant and an Untouchable.
Crowning Ceremony.
Only after these had been done was the King allowed to be crowned. At the most auspicious moment, selected by the astronomers, the King would be crowned by the royal priest with the Crown of Nepal, a large jewel-encrusted crown.
After the Ceremony.
The King's subjects, family and courtiers would salute him and there would be a parade. The King, royal family and other guests and courtiers would ride through the streets of Kathmandu on elephants.

Bassoon Quintet (Waterhouse)

The Bassoon Quintet (German: Fagott-Quintett) is a quintet by Graham Waterhouse, composed in 2003 for bassoon and string quartet.
History.
In 2003 Graham Waterhouse composed the Bassoon Quintet, to be premiered as part of a composer's portrait concert at the Gasteig. On 5 October 2003 music for one to ten players, conducted by Yaron Traub, was performed in the Kleiner Konzertsaal, including the Piccolo Quintet. The bassoon part was first played by Lyndon Watts, the principal bassoonist of the Münchner Philharmoniker, in the presence of bassonist William Waterhouse, the composer's father. The string quartet was formed by Odette Couch, Kirsty Hilton, Isabel Charisius and the composer.
A revised version was performed in Munich on 14 March 2011 in a chamber concert of the Bavarian Tonkünstlerverband (Musical Artists' Association). The soloist was again Watts, who also premiered Bernd Redmann's "Migrant" for bassoon and string quartet, and played the first of four quartets for a woodwind instrument and string trio, called "Finnische Quartette", by Jörg Duda. The string players, besides the composer, were members of the Münchner Pilharmoniker, Clément Courtin, Namiko Fuse and Konstantin Sellheim.
The quintet is in preparation to be published by Zimmermann. It was played in concerts to celebrate the composer's 50th birthday in Munich and Frankfurt.
Music.
As in the composer's Cello Concerto of 1995, the movements of the quintet are in the sequence "slow introduction – fast – slow – fast". The introduction presents characteristic intervals and the wide tessitura of the bassoon, a range of three and a half octaves. The predominantly "lyrical mood" of the work is also established. "Restless energy" defines the Allegro movement, a four note motif is passed between cello and bassoon, later dominating figuration in the bassoon part.
The slow movement is reminiscent of the composer’s memories of liturgical Armenian chant, which he experienced in 1996 in the Armenian district of Jerusalem around Easter. He describes: "The meandering line, continually curling back on itself and the resonance of the massive, ancient stone walls are mirrored in the writing, as continually shifting, changing fragments of the "chant" are passed between the instruments".
The last movement has a more symphonic aspect. The strings and the bassoon play arpeggio motifs in open intervals such as fifths and major sixths. The intervals of the introduction reappear on high harmonics in the strings. A virtuoso coda concludes the work.

Spirillinida

Spirillinida is an order of Foraminifera in which the test, or shell, primitively consists of an enrolled open tube, coming after the proloculus, wound planospirally or conically, commonly composed of an optically single crystal of calcite. The aperture is a simple opening at the end of the tube. Advanced forms with more than one chamber may consist of a few crystals, or rarely, a mosaic of crystals of calcite. 
The Spirillinida was separated from the Rotaliida where it had been included as the Spirillinacea. However not only is the spirillinid test rather distinct from typical rotaliid tests commonly composed of radially laminate calicite, but so are the protists distinct. The gametes produced by spirillinids during sexual reproduction are amoeboid in contrast to the biflagellate gametes produced by most other foraminifera included rotaliids.

Usama Hasan

Usama Hasan is a former senior lecturer in business information systems at Middlesex University, and a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He has argued in favour of a compatibility between Islam and human evolution. He is also Senior Researcher in Islamic Studies at the Quilliam Foundation.
Career.
Hasan has a PhD, an MSc and an MA in Physics and Artificial Intelligence from the Universities of Cambridge & London. He followed the family tradition of Islamic scholarship, becoming an Imam at the Masjid al-Tawhid mosque in Leyton. He is a certified transmitter of the Qur'an and Hadith and has translated a number of Islamic texts into English, including The Islamic Foundation's "Way of the Prophet" (2009). He has stated that he fought in Afghanistan against the Russian occupation.
Hasan was a member of the United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s Projecting British Muslims delegations to Egypt in 2008 and to Afghanistan (Helmand) in 2010, was a Keynote Speaker at the Anglo-Syrian government-sponsored conference "The Message of Peace in Islam" in Damascus in 2009, and is a Patron of both the Forum for the Discussion of Israel and Palestine (FODIP) and Friends of the Bereaved Families Forum. Usama was also a speaker at the Google Ideas/Council on Foreign Relations "Summit Against Violent Extremism" (Dublin, 2011).
He is Senior Researcher at the Quilliam Foundation and was also a Founding Advisor for the organization in 2008. According to the Quilliam website, Hasan "aims to address key questions on gender rights, minority rights, personal freedoms, penal codes; seeking to harmonise tradition and reason, faith and science, and developing the Sharia in keeping with the original Prophetic spirit of mercy, and away from rigid ritualism". He has made numerous appearances on Western and Eastern television channels, including "BBC Hardtalk", CNN, and has also written various columns for "The Guardian" and "The Washington Post".
Creationism controversy.
Hasan has argued that Islam is compatible with the theory of evolution, dismissing the story of Adam and Eve as "children's madrasa-level understanding" of human origins while pointing to antecedents of the modern theory of evolution among medieval Muslim philosophers like Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Miskawayh. His lectures have been disrupted by hecklers on occasion for suggesting that Islam is compatible with evolution and he claims to have received death threats.
Hasan later retracted some of his views on evolution. Several British Muslim writers, including Inayat Bunglawala and Yahya Birt, backed his right to free speech. On 5 January 2013, he was featured in a debate against Yasir Qadhi titled "Have Muslims Misunderstood Evolution?", where he argued in favor of human evolution.
Power struggles at the Masjid al-Tawhid.
He has complained about "extremism" at the Masjid al-Tawhid and in May 2012, as part of the arbitration process, he and all other trustees voluntarily stepped down from their positions as Trustee of the masjid. In June 2012, the new Trustees of the Trust changed the locks of the Mosque doors and employed security guards. According to the website of the Masjid al-Tawhid, the Hasan family "want to ... regain personal control of the mosque".
Al-Shabaab video threat.
In October 2013 Hasan was alerted by anti-terrorist police that he and other Muslim figures in the UK who had spoken out against Islamist extremism had been targeted by a propaganda video created by Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group responsible for the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya.

Energy Catalyzer

The Energy Catalyzer (also called E-Cat) is a purported cold fusion or Low-Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) heat source which was devised by inventor Andrea Rossi with support from physicist Sergio Focardi. An Italian patent, which received a formal but not a technical examination, describes the apparatus as a "process and equipment to obtain exothermal reactions, in particular from nickel and hydrogen". 
Rossi and Focardi said the device worked by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel powder, transmuting it into copper and producing heat. The international patent application received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability because it was adjudged to "offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories".
The device was demonstrated to invited audiences several times in 2011, and commented on by various academics and others, but no independent tests have been made, and no peer-reviewed tests have been published. Steve Featherstone wrote in "Popular Science" that by the summer of 2012 Rossi's "outlandish claims" for the E-Cat seemed "thoroughly debunked" and that Rossi "looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end."
Reactions to the claims.
In March 2012, Professor Ugo Bardi of the University of Florence wrote on his blog that claims made by Rossi regarding the emission or non-emission of gamma radiation, the location of a supposed factory – in Florida, or not in the United States at all – and the fact that some of his supporters are apparently deserting him, indicated that "... the E-Cat has reached the end of the line. It still maintains some faithful supporters, but, most likely, it will soon fade away in the darkness of pathological science, where it belongs". In reply to a non-peer-reviewed paper submitted to the arxiv digital archive in May 2013, he added that "This is the n-th claim of success of a long series that has led to nothing verifiable and that has become rather boring."
Peter Ekström, lecturer at the Department of Nuclear Physics at Lund University in Sweden, concluded in May 2011, "I am convinced that the whole story is one big scam, and that it will be revealed in less than one year." He cites the unlikelihood of a chemical reaction being strong enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier, the lack of gamma rays, the lack of explanation for the origin of the extra energy, the lack of the expected radioactivity after fusing a proton with 58Ni, the unexplained occurrence of 11% iron in the spent fuel, the 10% copper in the spent fuel strangely having the same isotopic ratios as natural copper, and the lack of any unstable copper isotope in the spent fuel as if the reactor only produced stable isotopes. Kjell Aleklett, physics professor at Uppsala University, said the percentage of copper was too high for any known reaction of nickel, and the copper had the same isotopic ratio as natural copper. He also stated, "Known chemical reactions cannot explain the amount of energy measured. A nuclear reaction can explain the amount of energy, but the knowledge we have today says that this reaction cannot take place." James Randi, discussing the E-Cat in the context of previous cold fusion claims, says that it doesn't work.
Other reactions to the device have been mixed. In 1998 Dennis M. Bushnell, Chief Scientist at NASA Langley Research Center, described LENR as a "promising" technology and praised the work of Rossi and Focardi. Roland Pettersson, retired Associate Professor from the University of Uppsala, who witnessed a 2011 demonstration said "I'm convinced that this works, but there is still room for more measurements".
Theoretical astrophysicist Ethan Siegel and nuclear physicist Peter Thieberger argue that the claims for the E-Cat are incompatible with the fundamentals of nuclear physics. – the authors argue that it is now time "for the e-Cat's proponents to provide the provable, testable, reproducible science that can answer these straightforward physics objections."
Swedish physicists, Hanno Essén and Sven Kullander stated that if the claims that they had read about the e-cat were true, then it must operate through some kind of a nuclear reaction. However, they had no access to privileged information about the catalysts in Rossi's device. According to Kullander it is "important "to consider the experimental facts and not indulge too much in speculation about what could happen in theory". Kullander also emphasized that measurements of excess heat must be made accurately and independently: "You have to rely on Rossi that he is true to what he conveys and through discussions with him we may try to conclude how reliable the measurements are."
Theoretical nuclear physicist Yeong E. Kim of Purdue University has proposed a potential theoretical explanation of the reported results of the device, but has stated that, for confirmation of this theory, "it is very important to carry out Rossi-type experiments independently." Kim had previously put forward this theory to explain the results of the discredited Fleischman and Pons cold fusion experiment in 1989.
Patents.
An application in 2008 to patent the device internationally had received an unfavorable preliminary report on patentability at the World Intellectual Property Organization from the European Patent Office, noting that the description of the device was based on "general statements and speculations" and citing "numerous deficiencies in both the description and in the evidence provided to support its feasibility" as well as incompatibilities with "generally accepted laws of physics and established theories." The patent application was published on 15 October 2009.
On 6 April 2011 an application was approved by the Italian Patent and Trademark Office, which issued a patent for the invention, valid only in Italy. Under then-current Italian law, the examination of the application was more formal and less technical than for the corresponding PCT application.
In March 2014 the US Patent Office replied to Rossi's US patent application with a provisional decision to reject it, saying "The specification is objected to as inoperable. Specifically there is no evidence in the corpus of nuclear science to substantiate the claim that nickel will spontaneously ionize hydrogen gas and therefore 'absorb' the resulting proton".
Demonstrations and experiments.
Invited guests attended several demonstrations in Bologna in 2011. The device has not been not independently verified. Of a January demonstration, Discovery Channel analyst Benjamin Radford wrote that "If this all sounds fishy to you, it should," and that "In many ways cold fusion is similar to perpetual motion machines. The principles defy the laws of physics, but that doesn't stop people from periodically claiming to have invented or discovered one." According to PhysOrg (11 August 2011), the demonstrations held from January to April 2011 had several flaws that compromised their credibility and Rossi had refused to perform tests that could verify his claims.
University of Bologna researchers have attended some E-Cat experiments, but only as observers. On 5 November 2011, the University of Bologna clarified that its researchers had not been involved in the demonstrations and that none of the experiments took place at the university. Rossi had signed a contract with the university, but the contract was terminated and no research was done because Rossi didn't make the first payment.
Skeptic Ian Bryce believes that the E-cat is misconnected during demonstrations, and that the power attributed to fusion is supplied to the device through the earth wire. Dick Smith offered Rossi one million dollars to demonstrate that the E-Cat system worked as claimed, while the power through the earth wire was also being measured, which Rossi refused. Peter Thieberger, a senior physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, said it would be very difficult for this misconnection to happen by accident and that the issue could only be cleared with a fully independent test.
Another demonstration on 6 October 2011 reportedly lasted for about eight hours. Roland Pettersson, retired Associate Professor from the University of Uppsala, who witnessed it said "I'm convinced that this works, but there is still room for more measurements".
On 28 October 2011 the unit was "customer tested" and was said to release 2,635 kWh during five and a half hours of self-sustained mode, an average power of 479 kilowatts – just under half the promised power of one megawatt. Independent observers were not allowed to watch the measurements or make their own, and the plant remained connected to a power supply during the test allegedly to supply power to the fans and the water pumps.
Tests.
Because of his research into cold fusion for over 15 years, Sergio Focardi was contacted by Andrea Rossi in 2007 in order to validate the apparatus at its early stage of development. After four years of work and measurements together with Rossi, Focardi concluded that nuclear fusion reactions happen inside the Energy Catalyzer. Focardi states that the nuclear process is facilitated by a secret additive, known only by Rossi and not by him. According to Focardi, the process would be much less intense without this additive. Rossi and Focardi are then reported to have been unable to find a peer-reviewed scientific journal that would publish their paper describing how they claim the Energy Catalyzer operates. Their paper appears only in Rossi's self-published blog, "Journal of Nuclear Physics".
In May 2013 a non-peer-reviewed paper describing "results obtained from evaluations of the operation of the E-Cat HT in two test runs" was submitted to the arxiv digital archive. Although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process, they concluded that, even by the most conservative of measurements, the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude, and possibly several, higher than any other conventional energy source, including gasoline. The test was partly funded by the Swedish energy research consortium, Elforsk. Elforsk stated on their website that the results were very remarkable, but that it was highly questionable to speculate whether nuclear transformation had occurred when no access had been provided to the reactants. In a response to the original paper, also published on arxiv, commentators criticized the testing as not truly independent, described the report as having "characteristics more typically found in pseudo‐scientific texts", and stated that "The authors seem to jump to conclusions fitting pre‐conceived ideas where alternative explanations are possible." Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel commented at scienceblogs saying Rossi did not allow the reactants or products to be measured on this occasion. In the previous tests there were not enough Nickel-62 and Nickel-64 (the only two isotopes which can fuse with hydrogen), at 3.6% and 0.9% respectively, in the reactants to explain the 10% copper output; these isotope levels are typical of natural copper, rather than of fusion by-product. According to Siegel, Rossi also refused to unplug the machine while it was operating despite it being an easy way to surreptitiously power the device. He also added that the supposedly independent testers had to rely on data supplied by Rossi.
In the press release announcing the acquisition of the E-Cat technology by "Industrial Heat" they referred to the "independent test" and said that "In addition, performance validation tests were conducted in the presence of IH personnel and certified by an independent expert."
Ownership and licensing.
Originally, a Greek company Defkalion was supposedly going to produce the E-Cat, but this deal was terminated in 2011 and Defkalion announced that they planned to make a similar device. In 2012 an Italian company, Prometeon Srl became the official Italian licensee for the E-Cat.
Ecat.com is a website for taking "non-binding orders" for the device. It is run by four Swedish entrepreneurs, two of them particle physicists. One of the physicists, Magnus Holm, in response to suggestions that he was "contributing to fraud" replied "We are not engaged in any deception, and I do not think Rossi is engaged in any fraud either. If it would turn out that it does not work, in spite of everything, I would think it is about self-deception."
In January 2014 Industrial Heat LLC, a U.S. Company based in Raleigh, N.C., announced that it has acquired the "intellectual property and licensing rights" to the E-Cat. Popular Science called the acquisition "interesting" and said, "There are many reasons to be skeptical of the technology, considering that it has never been conclusively proven to work, and claims to work via an unfamiliar chemical reaction. Rossi has also previously passed off spurious inventions, and has repeatedly backed-out of third party testing of the E-Cat, for example with NASA." Triangle Business Journal reported that 14 investors have put $11.6 million into the company, as "a mixture of equity, debt and options". They noted that CEO Tom Darden is also CEO of Cherokee Investment Partners, which has "nearly $2 billion under management", and that Industrial Heat was "one of the topics he discussed with Chinese officials on a recent trip to China." Rossi "claims to focus on his role as head of research for the technology".

Pomone (opera)

Pomone ("Pomona") is an opera in a prologue and five acts by Robert Cambert with a libretto by Pierre Perrin. It has been described as "effectively the first French opera." It was first performed in Paris at the Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille theatre belonging to Cambert and Perrin's Académie d'Opéra on 3 March 1671. The production had set designs and machinery by Alexandre de Rieux, marquis de Sourdéac. The novelty of the work drew large audiences and the opera enjoyed 146 performances over the eight months of its run. The score of "Pomone" has only partially survived.
Background and performance history.
Attempts had been made to introduce Italian opera to France in the mid-17th century but French audiences had disliked the genre, preferring their own form of stage music drama, the "ballet de cour", a ballet containing sung elements. Nevertheless, some French composers began to experiment with developing opera which would better suit national tastes. On 28 June 1669, King Louis XIV had granted Perrin and his Académie d'Opéra the monopoly on performing operas on the Parisian stage. "Pomone" was the first production by the Académie. It contained many of the features audience were used to in the "ballet de cour": dance, spectacular stage effects and rich costumes. The innovations were the replacement of spoken dialogue by recitative and the use of more complicated vocal ensembles. The pastoral theme of the work was not new, for instance Cambert had already composed music for a stage work called the "Pastorale d'Issy" in 1659. In spite of "Pomone'"s success, Perrin soon ran into financial difficulties. The Académie staged another opera with music by Cambert, "Les peines et les plaisirs de l'Amour", in early 1672, but the king then revoked Perrin's monopoly on opera production and transferred it to his favourite composer, Jean-Baptiste Lully, who would have more success in establishing a lasting French operatic tradition. Cambert moved to London with his pupil Louis Grabu, where he staged a version of "Pomone" with additional music by Grabu.
Synopsis.
Vertumne is in love with Pomone and Pomone's nurse Beroé is in love with Vertumne. Vertumne assumes various disguises in his attempts to seduce Pomone: a dragon, Pluto, Bacchus. He only succeeds when he disguises himself as Beroé, because Pomone cannot refuse her old nurse a kiss.
Recording.
The surviving 30 minutes of music was recorded by Hugo Reyne, conducting La Simphonie de Marais, on a 2-disc CD set also containing Jean-Baptiste Lully's "Les fêtes de l'Amour et de Bacchus" (Accord, 2004)

Maurizio Ferraris

Maurizio Ferraris (born February 7, 1956, Turin) is an Italian philosopher and scholar. 
His name is attached to the philosophical current named new realism (he wrote the Manifesto of New Realism in 2012, forthcoming for SUNY Press), that shares significant similarities with speculative realism and object oriented ontology. A pupil of Gianni Vattimo, and influenced by Jacques Derrida, he started as a theorist of hermeneutics before turning his attention to the analytic strand. Over the years he has been able to create an effective synthesis between the two approaches, creating a new ontological realism that rejects Kant's schematism in the cognitive area. Since 1995 he has been full Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he also runs the CTAO (Inter-University Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology) and the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology). He studied in Turin, Paris and Heidelberg and has taught in the major European Universities. He is the director of the Rivista di Estetica and is part of the directive committee of Critique and aut aut. From 1989 to 2010 he has written for the cultural supplement of Il Sole 24 ORE; since 2010 he has been writing for the cultural section of la Repubblica. His main areas of expertise are hermeneutics, aesthetics and ontology.
Biography.
Ferraris graduated from Philosophy at the University of Turin in 1979, under the guidance of Gianni Vattimo. In the early years of his career he divided his time between teaching, research and cultural journalism. From 1979 to 1988 he has been an editor, and then co-director, of Alfabeta, whose directive committee includes, among others, Antonio Porta, Nanni Balestrini, Maria Corti, Umberto Eco, Francesco Leonetti, Pier Aldo Rovatti and Paolo Volponi. In the early eighties he began his relationship with Derrida, who deeply marked his philosophical training. On the academic level, in 1984, after two years of teaching in Macerata (1982–83), he began to teach in Trieste, interspersing his didactic activities with a series of stays in Heidelberg. Here, after getting in contact with Gadamer, he started his studies in hermeneutics. In 1995, Ferraris was called in Turin, as a full Professor of Aesthetics, and later began teaching Metaphysics (Filosofia teoretica) in 1999. While working as a director of program (i.e. teacher) at the Collège international de philosophie from 1998 to 2004, in 2001 he founded the Laboratory for Ontology (LabOnt) and the Inter-University Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). Currently Ferraris is full Professor of Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he is also the Director of the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology) and of the Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). He is a Fellow of Käte Hamburger Kolleg “Recht als Kultur” (Bonn) and a Honorary Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies of South East Europe (Rijeka). He has been Fellow of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America and of the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. He has also been Directeur d’études of the Collège International de Philosophie and a Visiting Professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (Paris) as well as other European and American Universities, including. He is a columnist for ‘La Repubblica’, the Director of ‘Rivista di Estetica’, and the Co-director of ‘Critique’ and the ‘Revue francophone d’esthétique’. He wrote almost fifty books that have been translated into several languages. The books that have appeared in English are: "History of Hermeneutics" (Humanities Press, 1996), "Documentality or Why it is Necessary to Leave Traces" (Fordham UP, 2012), "Goodbye Kant!" (SUNY UP, 2013); forthcoming in 2014: "Where Are You? An Ontology of the Cell Phone" (Fordham UP) and "Manifesto of New Realism" (SUNY UP). Maurizio Ferraris has worked in the field of aesthetics, hermeneutics, and social ontology, attacching is name to the theory of documentality, and contemporary New Realism.
Thought.
Ferraris’ early interests lied in French post-structuralist philosophy, with special attention to authors such as Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and Gilles Deleuze. A special role in the formation of his thought was undoubtedly played by Jacques Derrida, with whom Ferraris has maintained a relationship of research, later turned into a friendship, since 1981. Evidence of this phase of his thought can be found in his early works: "Differenze" (1981), "Tracce" (1983) and "La svolta testuale ("1984). Ferraris has specifically dedicated to Derrida: "Postille a Derrida ("1990), "Honoris causa a Derrida" (1998), I"ntroduzione a Derrida" (2003), "Il gusto del segreto" (1997) Taste for the Secret, Blackwell 2001 and, finally, "Jackie Derrida. Ritratto a memoria" (2006). While working with Gadamer, starting in the early eighties, Ferraris then turned to hermeneutics, writing: "Aspetti dell’ermeneutica del Novecento" (1986), "Ermeneutica di Proust" (1987), "Nietzsche e la filosofia del Novecento" (1989) and especially "Storia dell’ermeneutica" (1988) "History of Hermeneutics", Humanities Press, 1996
The turning point.
At the end of the eighties, Ferraris developed an articulated critique of Heidegger and Gadamer's tradition (see, in particular, "Cronistoria di una svolta", the 1990 afterword to Heidegger’s conference “The Turn”), which makes use of post-structuralism to challenge the romantic and idealistic legacy affecting such tradition. The conclusion of this critical path led the philosopher to the reconsideration of the relationship between the spirit and the letter as well as to a reversal of their traditional opposition. Oftentimes, both philosophers and ordinary people despise the letter (the rules and constraints instituted through documents and inscriptions of various kinds) and set the spirit (i.e. thought and will) above it, recognizing the creative freedom of the latter as opposed to the former. For Ferraris, it is the letter that precedes and founds the spirit. Thus occurred the transition to the second phase of the thought of the Italian philosopher.
Ferraris abandoned hermeneutic relativism and Derridean deconstruction to embrace a form of realistic objectivism according to which "objectivity and reality, considered by radical hermeneutics as principles of violence and abuse, are in fact – and precisely because of the contraposition between spirit and letter mentioned above – the only protection against arbitrariness". This principle, which applies to morals, is based on the acknowledgement of a sphere of reality that is independent of interpretations (see, in particular, L’ermeneutica, 1998). The external world, recognized as unamendable, and the relationship between conceptual schemes and sensory experience (aesthetics, restored to its etymological meaning of "science of sensory perception", acquires a primary significance – see, in particular, Analogon rationis (1994 ), Estetica (1996, with other authors), L’immaginazione (1996), Experimentelle Ästhetik (2001) and Estetica razionale (1997)) are the dominant themes of the second phase of Ferraris’ thought, which involves a re-reading of Kant through the naive physics of the perceptologist Paolo Bozzi (see Il mondo esterno (2001) and Goodbye Kant!(2004, forthcoming for SUNY Press)). Ferraris’ "critical ontology" recognizes the world of everyday life as largely impenetrable compared to conceptual schemes. The failure to acknowledge this principle traces back to the confusion between ontology (the sphere of being) and epistemology (the sphere of knowledge); such confusion is critically thematised by Ferraris starting from the character of unamendability that is typical of being as opposed to knowledge (see in particular: Ontologia (2003) and Storia dell’ontologia (2008, with other authors)). His reflection on realism led, in 2011, to the elaboration of the Manifesto of New Realism.
From social ontology to documentality.
The natural outcome of critical ontology is the twofold acknowledgement of the external world as unamendable and of the domain of objects which Kantian transcendental philosophy rightly applies to: that of social objects. This new phase of Ferraris’ thought was ideally inaugurated with the publication of Dove sei? Ontologia del telefonino (2005) are you? Ontology of the Cell Phone, forthcoming for Fordham UP and went on with Babbo Natale, Gesù adulto (2006), Sans Papier (2007), La fidanzata automatica (2007) and Il tunnel delle multe (2008). The basic thesis is that the distinction between ontology and epistemology, combined with the acknowledgment of the ontological autonomy of the sphere of social objects (regulated by the constitutive law "object = inscribed act"), allows for the correction of Derrida's thesis that "there is nothing outside the text "(literally, and asemantically,"there is no outside text") so as to theorize, against Searle, that “there is nothing social outside the text." This leads to the mature stage of Ferraris’ thought, fully exposed and systematized in what may be considered his summa: Documentalità. Perché è necessario lasciar tracce (2009) Why It Is Necessary to Leave Traces, Fordham UP, 2010 - A monographic issue of the ‚“Monist“ (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and Leonardo Caffo) will also shortly appear.
Documentality.
The most influential ontology of social reality, formulated by the American philosopher John Searle (1995), is based on collective intentionality, which allegedly ensures that certain physical objects (e.g. a piece of paper) are transformed into social objects (e.g. a banknote). As noted by Barry Smith (2003), this perspective has difficulty in accounting for both negative entities – such as debts, which apparently do not have a physical counterpart – and the new, seemingly intangible, social objects generated by the Web. The theory of documentality proposed by Maurizio Ferraris (2005) aims to solve these problems by arguing that social objects are always recordings of social acts. This accounts for both negative entities and the virtual entities of the web, which consist precisely of recordings just like any other social object. For the theory of documentality, the constitutive rule of social reality is "Object = Inscribed Act", where “inscribed” is equal to “recorded”. That is: a social object is the result of a social act (such as to involve at least two people), which is characterized by its being recorded on some support, including the minds of the people involved in the act (in the case of informal social acts such as promises) . Articulated by Ferraris (2009) in a complete ontological theory and by Smith ( 2012) in a theory of document acts, documentality has three main reasons of interest. First, it has been able to account for the substantial growth of documents and recording devices in the Web world, which is very well explained by the proposed constitutive law of social reality. Secondly, it has been able to explain why social reality, while requiring the presence of subjects for the enactment of acts, may develop independently from them and even without their knowledge (an economic recession can be taking place even if no human subject is aware of it). Third, instead of making social reality depend on the action of collective intentionality – with an increasing social constructivism (Searle 2010) – documentality is capable of substantiating a "new realism" (Ferraris, 2012) that helps continental philosophy come out of the impasses of postmodernism and reconnect with analytic philosophy. of this description of documentality: L. Caffo, "From Documentality to New Realism", in "The Monist", 97:2 April 2014.
New Realism.
Context: 
The realist turn carried out by Maurizio Ferraris starting from the formulation of aesthetics not as philosophy of art, but as ontology of perception and sensory experience (Estetica razionale 1997 new edition 2011), finds a further declination in the Manifesto del nuovo realismo (2012) of new realism, forthcoming for SUNY Press. New Realism – the principles of which were anticipated by Ferraris in an article published in La Repubblica on August 8, 2011 and which then started a massive debate – is primarily a consideration of some historical, cultural and political phenomena (i.e. the analysis of postmodernism up to its deteriorating into media populism). From these reflections follows the urge to shed light over the outcomes produced by the derivations of postmodernism within contemporary thought (i.e. the interpretation of philosophical realisms and "theories of truth" that developed starting from the end of last century in response to a deviation of the relationship between the individual and reality). This, in turn, leads to the proposal of an antidote to the degeneration of postmodernist ideology and the degraded and mendacious relationship with the world that it has caused: New Realism, in fact, identifies itself with the synergistic action of three key words, Ontology, Critique and Enlightenment. New Realism has been the subject of several debates and national and international conferences and has called for a series of publications that involve the concept of reality as a paradigm even in non-philosophical areas. In fact, the debate on new realism, for number of contributions and media response, has no equivalent in the recent cultural history, to the point of being chosen as 'case study' for the analysis of the sociology of communication and linguistics.
In the international arena, the Manifesto of new realism can be found in two translations (Chilean and Spanish, the latter enriched by a new essay by Ferraris and by a long introduction by Francisco José Martín, anticipated in the Revista de Occidente). Translations into English (Suny Press), German (Klostermann), and French Hermann) are forthcoming. New realism was discussed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung and the Süddeutsche Zeitung. A monographic issue of the ‚“Monist“ (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and Mario De Caro) will also shortly appear. Furthermore, the topic was re-elaborated both in Warumes die Welt nicht gibt by Markus Gabriel (Berlin, Ullstein Verlag 2013) and in Manifiesto del nuevo realismo analógico (Buenos Aires, Circulo Herméneutico 2013) by Mauricio Beuchot(México-UNAM) and José Luis Jerez (Argentina-UNCo).
History: 
In the frame of hermeneutics, as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, Maurizio Ferraris has proposed the so-called "New Realism" (Manifesto del nuovo realismo, 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers – such as Mario De Caro (see Bentornata Realtà, ed by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and continental philosophers, such as Mauricio Beuchot (Manifesto del realismo analogico, 2013), and Markus Gabriel (Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology, 2014). New Realism also garnered the support of great thinkers such as Umberto Eco, Hilary Putnam and John Searle, intersecting with other realistic movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the "speculative realism" defended by the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux and the American philosopher Graham Harman. For New Realism, the fact that it is becoming increasingly clear that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should say goodbye to reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world.
In this context, New Realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world opposes to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource – a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed. Now that the season of postmodernism has died out, New Realism expresses the widespread need for renewal in extra-disciplinary areas such as architecture, literature, pedagogy and medicine.

Gaza Airstrip

Gaza Airstrip , also known as Gush Katif Airport, is a small airfield in the Gaza Strip approximately two miles north of the town of Khan Yunis, and adjacent to the UNRWA Khan Younis refugee camp. It is immediately west of the former Israeli settlement of Ganei Tal, and named after the former Israeli settlement area of Gush Katif. It may be on the site of the former RAF Gaza, which was first used as an airstrip in 1941. Following the destruction of the Yasser Arafat International Airport it is currently the only usable runway in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli air blockade prevents the runway from being used.

During the Second World War RAF Gaza was used by a number of RAF squadrons, including 33, 45, 127, 208, 318 and 451. No.2 Air Crew Officers School was based on the airfield, and the Greek Training Flight was also based there from 1941-1942. The airfield was used as the Middle East ammunition depot from July to September 1942. Whether or not RAF Gaza was on the site of the present day Gaza Airstrip is unclear, as it was likely only of a temporary nature. Some sources place RAF Gaza to the southeast of Gaza City although there are no visible remains of the airfield there.
After the 1948 Palestinian exodus 35,000 refugees took shelter in a camp to the south of the present day airfield. This has become the UNRWA Khan Younis camp.
As part of the unilateral disengagement of Israel from Gaza, Jewish settlers were evicted from the Gush Katif area in 2004 and 2005.
In 2004, the airfield was in a good state of repair. The runway was kept clear, and runway markings were maintained. Following the handover to the Palestinian authorities along with the rest of Gush Katif, the airstrip was no longer maintained. It became partially covered by sand and reduced from a width of 80 ft to approximately 30 ft of usable tarmac, and the 225 ft overrun and backtracking loop at the northwest end became blocked with sand.
Present day.
The UNRWA Khan Younis refugee camp is adjacent to and south of the airfield, and the UNRWA Khan Younis Vocational Training Centre, built in 2007, is immediately south of the runway. The camp houses over 68,000 refugees. 
In 2010 the main 2,625 ft runway was still sufficiently clear to be used, due to its use as access to UNRWA Khan Younis.
Following the destruction of the runway of Gaza Airport in 2002, Gaza Airstrip is the only remaining runway in the Gaza Strip. Although the runway is short compared to Gaza Airport, with the tarmac overrun at the northwest end of the runway cleared of sand it is potentially long enough for STOL airliners such as the DHC-7 to operate safely. 500 ft of open ground beyond the overrun could be used to extend the runway.

No Orchids for Miss Blandish (novel)

No Orchids For Miss Blandish is a 1939 crime novel by the British writer James Hadley Chase. The novel was influenced by the American crime writer James M. Cain and the stories in the pulp
magazine "Black Mask".
"No Orchids for Miss Blandish" provoked considerable controversy because of its explicit depiction of sexuality and violence. The novel was a great critical success and was included in the "Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century".
In 1942, the novel was adapted into a stage play which ran for over 200 performances at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. In 1948, it was adapted into a British film "No Orchids for Miss Blandish". The 1971 American film "The Grissom Gang" was also based on the novel.
It was also the subject of a fairly well-known essay by George Orwell, "Raffles and Miss Blandish", and parodied by Raymond Queneau in "We Always Treat Women Too Well".
The 1939 novel was extensively rewritten and rearranged by the author in 1962 because he thought the world of 1939 too distant for a new generation of readers. Unfortunately this means that readers of the Orwell essay will not understand many of Orwell's quotations and references because they came from the earlier edition.

SacI homology domain

SacI homology domain is a family of evolutionarily related proteins.
This Pfam family represents a protein domain which shows homology to the yeast protein SacI . The SacI homology domain is most notably found at the amino terminal of the inositol 5'-phosphatase synaptojanin. 
Synaptic vesicles are recycled with remarkable speed and precision in nerve terminals. A major recycling pathway involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis at endocytic zones located around sites of release. Different 'accessory' proteins linked to this pathway have been shown to alter the shape and composition of lipid membranes, to modify membrane-coat protein interactions, and to influence actin polymerization. These include the GTPase dynamin, the lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase endophilin, and the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin.
The recessive suppressor of secretory defect in yeast Golgi and yeast actin function belongs to this family. This protein may be involved in the coordination of the activities of the secretory pathway and the actin cytoskeleton.
Human synaptojanin which may be localised on coated endocytic intermediates in nerve terminals also belongs to this family.
Examples.
Human genes encoding proteins containing this domain include:
FIG4; INPP5F; SACM1L; SYNJ1; SYNJ2;

The Jo Stafford Show (1961 TV series)

The Jo Stafford Show is a nine-episode British television programme which aired in the United Kingdom on a fortnightly basis starting 9 September 1961. It was presented by the singer Jo Stafford, who was joined on stage by guests from the world of music and television; each episode was based on a particular theme. The show was broadcast in the United Kingdom, and was also aired internationally.
Overview.
"The Jo Stafford Show" was produced as a series of one-hour specials. Stafford and her husband, Paul Weston, spent the summer of 1961 in London in order to record the show, and the series was produced by Associated TeleVision at the Borehamwood Studios in Hertfordshire. The programme featured Stafford and guests from the world of music and television in both the United Kingdom and United States, with each episode having a different theme, such as love or travel. The first episode featured the singer Ella Fitzgerald and the actress Claire Bloom in a show whose theme was love. Stafford and Fitzgerald performed a musical medley while Bloom recited poetry.This edition also featured a sketch with Kathleen Harrison and George Benson. The travel edition featured Kenneth More and the vintage motor car from the film "Genevieve".
The website "Television Heaven" cites a different edition as the series' opening episode, this one centered around the theme of the differences between British and American English. Guests included Graham Stark and Peter Sellers. At Stafford's personal request she was accompanied on stage for the series by the British vocal group, "The Polka Dots".
Although the series was produced in the United Kingdom, it was intended for international distribution. The website "Cherished Television" has called "The Jo Stafford Show" "the first truly international television musical series". "Television Heaven" says the show was "billed as the most ambitious series ever launched by a British television production company".

C-terminal telopeptide

In bone physiology, the C-terminal telopeptide (or more formally, carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks, and known by the acronym CTX) is a serum biomarker used to measure the rate of bone turnover. It can be useful in assisting clinicians to determine a patient's nonsurgical treatment response as well as evaluate a patient's risk of developing complications during healing following surgical intervention. The test used to detect the CTX marker is called the Serum CrossLaps, and it is more specific to bone resorption than any other test currently available.
Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw.
In the early 2000s, a link between bisphosphonate use and impaired bone physiology was noted. The strong inhibition of osteoclast function precipitated by bisphosphonate therapy can lead to inhibition of normal bone turnover, leading to impaired wound healing following trauma (such as dental surgery) or even spontaneous non-healing bone exposure. Because bisphosphonates are preferentially deposited in bone with high turnover rates, it is possible that the levels of bisphosphonate within the jaw bones are selectively elevated.
Risk determination.
With the advent of implant dentistry, more dental patients are undergoing therapies in the oral cavity that involve bone healing, such as surgical implant placement and bone grafting procedures. In order to evaluate the risk of osteonecrosis for a patient taking bisphosphonates, use of the CTX biomarker was introduced in 2000 by Rosen.
Use of the CTX biomarker.
Although a number of surrogate biomarkers exist for measuring the metabolic products of bone resorption, the serum CTX marker was chosen because it is both highly correlated to bone turnover rate and already available for detection in a laboratory test carried out by a major lab testing corporation.
The CTX test measures for the presence and concentration of a crosslink peptide sequence of type I collagen, found, among other tissues, in bone. This specific peptide sequence relates to bone turnover because it is the portion that is cleaved by osteoclasts during bone resorption, and its serum levels are therefore proportional to osteoclastic activity at the time the blood sample is drawn. Serum levels in healthy patients not taking bisphosphonates tends to hover above 300 pg/mL.
Patients who are placed on a 6-month drug holiday exhibit marked improvements in their serum CTX values; in one study, patients showed an improvement of 155.3 pg/mL over 6 months or a rate of 25.9 pg/mL each month.
Initially, urinary CTX levels were sought, but this proved to offer no greater value than urinary NTX values—both tests suffered from large spontaneous fluctuations unrelated to therapy or intervention, and were therefore largely unreliable. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody test for detecting serum CTX levels features minimal spontaneous disruption yet remarkable change to antiresorptive therapy, making the serum CTX assay both highly sensitive and specific.

Arge cyanocrocea

Arge cyanocrocea, the bramble sawfly, is a species belonging to the family Argidae subfamily Arginae. 
As all sawflies, these species are related to wasps and not to flies, but lack the typical wasp waist. Its head and thorax are black, while the abdomen is yellowish orange. 
"Arge cyanocrocea" can be distinguished from the similar "Arge pagana" by its dark wing patches and gray apex of wings and by its reddish legs, with small black rings. 
These sawflies are present in most of Europe, in the Caucasus, in Asia Minor and in Japan. 
The adults grow up to long and can be encountered from May to July, feeding on pollen and nectar of several Apiaceae species ("Aegopodium podagraria", "Meum athamanticum", "Heracleum sphondylium", etc.), Euphorbiaceae species ("Euphorbia" spp.) and Asteraceae species ("Tanacetum vulgare")
The larvae of this species look like caterpillars, but they have five pairs of prolegs, while caterpillars have four pairs. The larvae feed on the leaves of brambles (hence the common name), mainly blackberry ("Rubus fruticosus"), raspberry ("Rubus idaeus") and great burnet ("Sanguisorba officinalis").

VAC14

Protein VAC14 homolog, also known as ArPIKfyve (Associated Regulator of PIKfyve), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "VAC14" gene.
Functions and interactions.
The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. The ArPIKfyve protein scaffolds a trimolecular complex to tightly regulate the level of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of this complex are the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE and the Sac1-domain-containing PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase Sac3, encoded by the human gene FIG4. VAC14 functions as an activator of PIKFYVE. Studies in VAC14 knockout mice indicate that, in addition to increasing the PtdIns(3,5)P2-producing activity of PIKfyve, VAC14 also controls the steady-state levels of another rare phosphoinositide linked to PIKfyve enzyme activity – phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate. 
In addition to the formation of the ternary complex with PIKfyve and Sac3, ArPIKfyve is engaged in a number of other interactions. ArPIKfyve forms a stable complex with the PtdIns(3,5)P2-specific phosphatase Sac3, thereby protecting Sac3 from rapid degradation in the proteasome. ArPIKfyve forms a homooligomer through its carboxyl terminus. However, the number of monomers in the ArPIKfyve homooligomer, ArPIKfyve-Sac3 heterodimer or PIKfyve-ArPIKfyve-Sac3 heterotrimer is unknown. Human Vac14/ArPIKfyve also interacts with the PDZ (post-synaptic density) domain of neuronal nitric oxide synthase but the functional significance of this interaction is still unclear. ArPIKfyve facilitates insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface.
Lessons from VAC14 mouse models.
VAC14 knock-out mice die at, or shortly after birth and exhibit massive neurodegeneration. Fibroblasts from these mice display ~50% lower levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(5)P. A spontaneous mouse VAC14-point mutation (with arginine substitution of leucine156) is associated with reduced life span (up to 3 weeks), body size, enlarged brain ventricles, 50% decrease in PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels, diluted pigmentation, tremor and impaired motor function.
VAC14 and human disease.

Brianne Theisen-Eaton

Brianne Theisen-Eaton (born 18 December 1988) is a Canadian track and field athlete who competes in the heptathlon and women's pentathlon. She is an Olympian from London 2012 and holds the Canadian record for the indoor pentathlon with a score of 4768 points. Theisen-Eaton is a heptathlon silver medallist from the 2013 World Championships, and a pentathlon silver medallist from the 2014 World Indoor Championships. She is the only Canadian woman to podium in the multi-events at the World Championships.
A national junior champion in 2006, she took the heptathlon gold medal at the Pan American Junior Championships the following year. She enrolled at the University of Oregon and broke a number of school records in her first three years, winning back-to-back NCAA heptathlon titles in 2009 and 2010. She has also won twice at the NCAA Indoor Championship, including a collegiate pentathlon record in 2011.
Career.
Early life.
She was raised in Humboldt, Saskatchewan and attended Humboldt Collegiate Institute. While at high school she took part in track and field, volleyball and soccer. She found her niche in the track and field combined events and represented Canada at the 2005 World Youth Championships in Athletics, coming seventeenth in the girl's heptathlon. She was the national junior champion in the heptathlon in 2006 and took part in the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Beijing. In her senior year at high school she won the gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Junior Championships.
College athletics.
She received a sports scholarship at the University of Oregon, where she started a major in business administration in late 2007. In her first year she was the runner-up at the Pac-10 championships and came fourth in the heptathlon at the NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship. Theisen began her second year with a third place finish in the pentathlon at the NCAA Women's Indoor Track and Field Championship. The outdoor season saw her establish herself among the world elite in the heptathlon. She won the Pac-10 title, then set a personal record of 6086 points to win her first NCAA outdoor title, before finally going on to take the national heptathlon title that summer. This earned her a spot on the national team to make her senior international debut at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. As Canada's only representative in the event, she came in fifteenth place. In addition to her athletic breakthrough, she also received a mention for All-Academic honours that year.
Theisen continued her strong college form into the following year, winning her first pentathlon title at the 2010 NCAA Indoors with 4396 points and repeating as the Pac-10 Outdoor heptathlon champion. She also took a second consecutive victory at the NCAA Outdoors, improving her personal record to 6094 points. This total ranked her within the top twenty athletes in her discipline worldwide that year. At the NCAA Outdoors she had her second win of the competition when she helped the Oregon women's team to the 4×400-meter relay title. That year she also led Oregon to a decathlon/heptathlon double at the Texas Relays, as she claimed the win alongside her schoolmate Ashton Eaton to whom she was engaged ( they married in July 2013 ) .
In 2011 she won at the NCAA Indoor Championships for a second time and broke Jacquelyn Johnson's collegiate record mark with a total of 4540 points from five events. She suffered an injury in the outdoor season that year and missed ten months as a result. She returned at the Texas A&M Challenge in January 2012 and recorded a score of 4555 points to win the meet. This was a new collegiate and Canadian national record for the event, beating Jill Ross-Giffen's previous score, and Theisen improved her personal bests in the shot put (12.87 m) and high jump (1.88 m) events. A third NCAA Indoor title came two months later with a winning score of 4536 points, which included a 60 m hurdles best of 8.25 seconds. She also repeated as the heptathlon champion and her personal best score of 6440 points included four new bests in individual events (hurdles, shot put, long jump and javelin).
Professional.
Theisen placed second at the Canadian Track and Field Championships and went on to finish eleventh in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships, however a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying "I'm at peace getting silver knowing I gave it 110 per cent. Ashton and I talked about both being on the podium here. I watched Ashton the last couple of years winning his medals and could only imagine what that actually felt like." In her last outing that year she was third at the Decastar meet in France. At the 2014 World Indoor Championships in Poland, Theisen captured silver in pentathlon with a personal best score of 4768, breaking her own national record.
Personal.
She married American decathlete and world record holder Ashton Eaton in July 2013. The pair had originally met while competing together at the University of Oregon.

List of people reported to have lived beyond 130

This is a list of people who have been reported to have lived beyond 130 years. The oldest person whose age was verified by modern standards was Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122. The cases in this list include both semi-legendary personages and people whose existence is not doubted.
Argentina.
The "London Chronicle" reported in September 5, 1785, the history of Louisa Truxo, who supposedly lived until 175 years old (1610?-1785).
British Empire.
Cases of extreme longevity were listed by James Easton in 1799; his list was reprinted by James Cowles Prichard in 1813. "Kirby's wonderful and eccentric museum", of 1820, reports many of the same cases, some referenced to the "Philosophical Transactions" of the Royal Society. Charles Hulbert edited a book containing a list of cases in 1825. Sharon Turner in "The Sacred History of The World", Vol. III, 1839, included many cases cited to Easton, to Haller, or to a "Mr Whitehurst".
William Thoms, an antiquarian, published a sceptical work on longevity in 1879. 
Easton cases.
Welsh bard Llywarch Hen ("Heroic Elegies") died c. 500 in the parish of Llanvor, traditionally about age 150.
A brief biography of Henry Jenkins, of Ellerton-on-Swale, Yorkshire, was written by Anne Saville in 1663 based on Jenkins's description, stating birth in 1501; he also claimed to recall the 1513 Battle of Flodden Field. However, Jenkins also testified in 1667, in favor of Charles Anthony in a court case against Calvert Smythson, that he was then only 157 or thereabouts. He was born in Bolton-on-Swale, and the date given, 17 May 1500, results in only a 1 year discrepancy with the age of 169 on his monument (he died 8 December 1670).
Thomas Parr is recorded by Easton as having died in 1635 at 152, the case having been recorded in "Philosophical Transactions" of the Royal Society. William Harvey carried out a postmortem on him, according to Easton.
Hulbert cases.
Hulbert also includes the cases of Lywerch Hen and Thomas Parr.
South Africa.
Alic Natas (b. 1908/2014)
Nepal.
Bir Narayan Chaudhary (1856-1998) reportedly lived to age 141, though he had no birth certificate to authenticate this because such documents did not exist in rural Nepal at the time of his reported birth. However, in 1998 King Birendra of Nepal recognized and honored the elderly resident of the small Tharu village of Aamjhoki in Nepal's Tarai region as the oldest man in the kingdom. His age of 141 was meticulously verified by Nepal's Ministry of Archaeology based on astrological charts made at the time of his birth.
Pakistan.
The 1973 "National Geographic" article on longevity also reported, as a very aged people, the Burusho or Hunza people in the Hunza Valley of the mountains of Pakistan.
Feroz-ud-Din Mir (10 March 1872).
Russia (Soviet Union).
Deaths officially reported in Russia in 1815 listed 1068 centenarians, including 246 supercentenarians (50 at age 120–155 and one even older). "Time" magazine considered that, by the Soviet Union, longevity had elevated to a state-supported "Methuselah cult". The USSR insisted on its citizens' unrivaled longevity by claiming 592 people (224 male, 368 female) over age 120 in a 15 January 1959 census and 100 citizens of Russia alone ages 120 to 156 in March 1960. Such later claims were fostered by Georgian-born Joseph Stalin's apparent hope that he would live long past 70. Zhores Medvedev, who demonstrated that all 500-plus claims failed birth-record validation and other tests, said Stalin "liked the idea that Georgians lived to be 100". However, longevity claims from Caucasus continued well after Stalin's death, and longevity has been explained by specific lifestyle and health effects of kefir.
Sweden.
Anna Persdotter died in 1689 in Leksand at a reported 1024 years.
Niels Paulsen, from Uppsala, died in 1907 aged 160.
Switzerland.
In the 18th century, Swiss anatomist Albrecht von Haller collected examples of 62 people ages 110–120, 29 ages 120–130, and 15 ages 130–140.
United States of America.
A periodical "The Aesculapian Register", written by physicians and published in Philadelphia in 1824, listed a number of cases, including several purported to have lived over 130. The authors said the list was taken from the "Dublin Magazine".
Charlie Smith, who died October 5, 1979, claimed to have been born in 1842, which would have made him the oldest person in the United States. Prior to Smith's death, the Guinness Book of World Records had called his claim into question, noting that Smith's marriage certificate from 1910 stated that he was 35 years old at the time.
Uzbekistan.
Tuti Yusupova is alleged to have been born on July 1, 1880 and claims to be the world's oldest living person at the age of .
Yemen.
Abdel Wali Numan is said to have lived 142 years (1865-2007).
Saudi Arabia.
Mohammed bin Zarei(b.1858/1859 - d.2013) 
Algeria.
Mubarak Rahmani Messe(b.1873 - d.January 2014)
Legendary and religion related people.
These people are often reported to have lived for centuries. Some interpreters of religious texts claim that the years actually refer to months, but there is no consensus about this.
Ancient Sumer.
Age claims for the earliest eight Sumerian kings in the major recension of the Sumerian King List were in units and fractions of "shar" (3,600 years) and totaled 67 "shar" or 241,200 years.
In the only ten-king tablet recension of this list two kings (Alalngar, [...]kidunnu, and En-men-dur-ana) are recorded as having reigned 72,000 years in total. The major recension assigns 43,200 years to the reign of En-men-lu-ana, and 36,000 years each to those of Alalngar and Dumuzid.
Hebrew Bible.
The Hebrew Bible, the Torah, Joshua, Job, and 2 Chronicles mention individuals with lifespans up to the 969 years of Methuselah. 
Some literary critics explain these extreme ages as ancient mistranslations that converted the word "month" to "year", mistaking lunar cycles for solar ones: this would turn an age of 969 "years" into a more reasonable 969 lunar months, or 78½ years of the Metonic cycle. However, the text says that Arpachshad (son of Shem) fathered Shelah at 35 years of age. If that is taken to mean 35 months, then Arpachshad was a father before turning three years of age – which is clearly impossible. In addition, the first chapters of Genesis distinguish solar cycles of years from lunar cycles of months. (Genesis 1:14–16; 7:11)
Donald Etz says that the Genesis 5 numbers were multiplied by ten by a later editor. These interpretations introduce an inconsistency as the ages of the first nine patriarchs at fatherhood, ranging from 62 to 230 years in the manuscripts, would then be transformed into an implausible range such as 5 to 18½ years. Others say that the first list, of only 10 names for 1,656 years, may contain generational gaps, which would have been represented by the lengthy lifetimes attributed to the patriarchs. Nineteenth-century critic Vincent Goehlert suggests the lifetimes "represented epochs merely, to which were given the names of the personages especially prominent in such epochs, who, in consequence of their comparatively long lives, were able to acquire an exalted influence."
Those biblical scholars that teach literal interpretation give explanations for the advanced ages of the early patriarchs. In one view man was originally to have everlasting life, but as sin was introduced into the world by Adam, its influence became greater with each generation and God progressively shortened man's life. The biblical upper limit of longevity was categorized by the Bible scholar Witness Lee as having four successive plateaus of 1,000, 500, 250, and finally 120 years, and "four falls of mankind" correspond to these four plateaus. In a second view, before Noah's flood, a "firmament" over the earth () contributed to people's advanced ages.
Persian empire.
The reigns of several shahs in the "Shahnameh", an epic poem by Ferdowsi of around 1000 AD, are given as longer than a century:
Japan.
Some early emperors of Japan ruled for more than a century, according to the tradition documented in the "Kojiki".
Vietnam.
The 18 first Hùng kings of Vietnam were reported to live at least over 200 years each. Their reign lasted from 2879 BC to 258 BC.
Roman empire.
In Roman times, Pliny wrote about longevity records from the census carried out in 74 AD under Vespasian. In one region of Italy many people allegedly lived past 100; four were said to be 130, others even older. 
"Macrobii".
A book "Macrobii" ("Long-livers") is a work devoted to longevity. It was attributed to the ancient Greek author Lucian, although it is now accepted that he could not have written it. Most examples given in it are lifespans of 80 to 100 years, but some are much longer:
Christianity.
Saint Servatius, bishop of Tongeren in continental Europe, died 13 May 384 according to consistent tradition. He was consecrated at the alleged age of 297, and is said to have lived for 375 years (birth 8/9 AD).

Philip I Courtenay

Sir Philip I Courtenay (c.1355 – 29 July 1406), of Powderham, Devon was the fifth son of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (1303-1377). He was the founder of the cadet dynasty known as "Courtenay of Powderham", seated at the manor of Powderham, until then a former Bohun manor of little importance, whilst the line descended from his elder brother, the Earls of Devon of the mediaeval era, continued to be seated at Tiverton Castle and Okehampton. 
Early life.
Sir Philip Courtenay was the fifth son of eight sons of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (1303–1377) and Margaret de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford by his wife Elizabeth Plantagenet (1282-1316), a daughter of King Edward I.
Military and naval career.
He was known as a rash, angry and temperamental man but was skillful in naval and military affairs. Philip served during the Spanish War. He was with Edward the Black Prince at the famous victory of the Battle of Najera. He was knighted before the battle with his brothers Peter Courtenay, K.G., and Hugh Courtenay, K.G.
On his return Sir Philip was made Admiral of the West responsible for defending a coast plagued by pirates. In 1373 he was put in charge of a large supply convoy to Gascony. In August, the expedition took the Castle of Gurry.
Back in England, he launched a petition to parliament protesting against corruption of the Stannaries, which he claimed was preventing protection and patrol of the coastline. That August, Philip was engaged with Peter in a desperate battle against the Spaniards during which they were both captured as supplies failed to get through to Gascony. Two Bristol burgesses paid a large ransom for their release. In return they were granted trading exemptions from customs tax.
In February 1383, he become Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, serving for 10 years under King Richard II. He attended the parliament that met at Salisbury in April 1384, but in July his duties were taken over by the deputies. In 1385 the King gave him powers of administration in Dublin. He did not stay long and returned to London on 6 May. That Christmas the Great Council met to discuss charges of extortion levelled at Courtenay. In January 1386 he was dismissed from his post, arrested by the Crown in March. Sir Robert de Vere was created Marquess of Dublin and Viceroy. By 1387, De Vere was styling himself as duke of Ireland. Courtenay was elected for the commons in October 1386, and petitioned against the injustice. He received compensation for the loss of Ireland. By the end of 1387, the Lords Appellant had banished de Vere.
Landholdings.
He also served as Steward of Cornwall in the 12th year of the reign of Richard II. Pope Urban VI challenged the English to join a Crusade in 1383. John of Gaunt opposed any such venture; whereas the clerical party was supported by Bishop Despenser of Norwich and Sir Philip Courtenay. Gaunt made the Priory of Somborne over to the Courtenays. There in Hampshire they attacked and tortured the Carmelites, and when they accused Gaunt of treason, the knights caused the death of the Friar.
It is perhaps as well for his privilege that Sir Philip was elected to parliament in February 1383 for he was not a favourite of Richard II. Edward III had granted him a pension of £100 for life, which was confirmed by Richard II in 1378. The Black Prince had granted him two annuities of £50 each from the Duchy of Cornwall, which were doubled on his marriage in 1393.
Richard II demanded his presence in parliament because he had been given the official post of Keeper of Dartmoor Forest in 1370, and granted substantial estates in Devon from 1380. In March 1388, he received four parks, which he forfeited to the Merciless Parliament. But he was granted the Royal Manor of Haslebury Plucknett for a period of six years. In 1391, the manor of Dartmoor and manor of Bradninch were granted to him and his wife, for the sum of £39 p/a. All these landholding decisions were confirmed by Henry IV.
In December 1404, the King ordered Philip to grant Dartmoor and Bradninch to Henry, Prince of Wales.
Ireland.
Courtenay was still Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall until 1392. Two years later he was preparing to go on an expedition with the king to Ireland. Philip was in charge of royal household arrangements. He was to this end commissioned to find fish from Devon and Cornwall for provisions. Whilst in Ireland he soon fell out with de Vere, the royal favourite, and was removed as royal troops commissioner.
Military experience.
By 1399 Sir Philip was an experienced soldier called upon to suppress the Welsh revolt. He called up the Commissions of Array. He bought transporters of the soldiers and horses for the 1402 expedition to Brittany, and the sailing against the King of Scotland in 1400.
Politician.
He criticised ships lying idle in the docks, and reported to the Royal Council. They urged Henry IV to bring the experience of the West Country men in provisioning stores against France in 1402. Sir Philip also sat on the Council of 1405. Despite falling into terrible debts governing Ireland, he was exonerated of any crimes and pardoned by the King in 1393. When two men were dispossessed of their property Philip encouraged arbitrators Sir Peter Chudleigh and Sir James Chudleigh MP to decide. Many men complained of Courtenay's conduct: Sir Thomas Pomeroy was returned some property lost in Exeter in 1402. And Nicholas Potyngton managed to renew his complaint of 1393 for the loss of manor of Bickleigh. Abbot of Newenham's was stolen by sixty retainers; Courtenay ignored the summons. This he also did forbidding access to Abbot of Beaulieu.
Imprisonment.
Sir Philip was imprisoned in the Tower in November 1402 for clerical abuses against the Church. On 29 November he was forced to pay a recognizance of £100 by Sir John Arundell and to Sir John Herle and Sir William Sturmy a surety of £1000.
Inheritance.
Philip had been very fortunate to receive property on the death of relatives. In 1357 he received the reversion the manor of Moreton on the death of his brother, Thomas. In 1374 he had gained Broadwindsor and Cadleigh on the death of his brother, Sir Peter Courtenay, and the reversion of Honiton and Nuneham Courtenay, and East Coker. The Earl left him 100 marks in his will. In 1377, Sir Philip returned advowsons of Honiton and East Coker to Exeter Cathedral to construct a memorial to his father. His mother also left him seven manors from 1391 as well as her chapel.
Philip was granted Powderham Castle by his mother upon her death in 1391, as well as seven other manors. He was succeeded by his son, Richard, Lord Bishop of Ireland, upon his death on 29 July 1406. At that time he held one manor and hamlet in Dorset; three manors and a moiety and three advoswons in Somerset; and seventeen manors and five advowsons in Devon with some smaller properties. He was valued in 1405 to have an income of £140 pa.
Family.
Courtenay married Ann Wake, the daughter of Sir Thomas Wake of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, by Alice, the daughter of Sir John de Pateshulle. They had three sons and two daughters:

Vorupør

Vorupør is a coastal parish in the district of Thy on the North Sea coast of Jutland, Denmark. The major and northern settlement, "Nørre Vorupør", has a population of 591 (1 January 2014) while "Sønder Vorupør" 2 km further south is much smaller. Vorupør is situated in Thisted Municipality, North Denmark Region.
While the traditional occupation was fishery, it is today mainly a small-scale tourist resort, known for its beaches, nature and relative unspoiltness, as compared to other resorts. Vorupør is situated in the middle of the Thy National Park which was inaugurated in 2008, however, the vast dune and heath areas surrounding the village have been protected areas for some decades.
Fishery.
Like in other Danish coastal communities, full-time fishery has diminished. The last occupationally operated coastal boat stopped by 2010, but boats being operated for fishing tourists remain. Most of the fishing has traditionally been longline fishing, especially for cod. The smaller dinghies used for part-time fishing remain. Fishery with shallow boats built for dragging on to the open beach was formerly practised at many places in Northern Jutland, but remains only in Vorupør, Lild Strand and, most intensely, in Thorup Strand.
The pier at Vorupør was built in 1908 for protecting the boat landing site. The end of the pier is the most remote point from Copenhagen within Denmark, excluding the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Vorupør has a coastal rescue station under the Danish Maritime Safety Administration.
In 1887 local fishermen founded "Fiskercompagniet", the world's first cooperative fishing organisation. This local initiative was inspired by the Danish cooperative movement which was much more prevalent among farmers, and to some extent among urban workers. The co-op was originally based on strongly Christian rules, reflecting the religiousity of the community.

Benicia (barquentine)

Benicia was a barquentine built by Matthew Turner in Benicia, California in 1899. She was known for a fast passage from Newcastle, New South Wales to Kehei, Hawaii, of 35 days. Barkentine "Benicia" was wrecked in Haiti in 1920.
Turner's influence on schooner "Benicia".
At least two other sailing vessels also carried the name "Benicia." Gibbs reports that Turner's influence on the South Seas schooner was still evident as late as 1941, when a two-masted schooner, "Benicia", built in Tahiti by a shipwright who had worked in Turner's yard, arrived in San Francisco under the French flag.
1883 iron ship "Benicia".
An 899-ton iron ship named "Benicia" was launched in Oct. 1883, for Liverpool owners, by Whitehaven Iron Shipbuilding Co.

Trolleybuses in Wolverhampton

The Wolverhampton trolleybus system served the city of Wolverhampton, then in Staffordshire, England (and now in West Midlands, England), for much of the twentieth century.
Opened on , the system was one of the most extensive trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, with a total of 14 routes, a maximum fleet of 173 trolleybuses. For a brief period in the 1930s, it even had the distinction of being the world's largest trolleybus system. It was closed on .

The M.G.M. Album

The M.G.M. Album is a 1989 album by American vocalist Michael Feinstein of songs from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films. The album is arranged by Ian Bernard and Larry Wilcox.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by William Ruhlmann awarded the album three stars and said of Feinstein, "As usual, Feinstein sings in his earnest tenor, which has gained range and expression as an instrument over his recording career, and he savors the words with a scholar's affection. He serves the material, sometimes reverently, although it is still true that the least impressive thing about a Michael Feinstein album tends to be Michael Feinstein himself".

Hello Hemingway

Hello Hemingway is a 1990 Cuban drama film directed by Fernando Pérez and starring Laura de la Uz. The plot, set in Havana in the last period of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship, follows a young girl whose aspirations to obtain a scholarship in America, against the odds, are paralleled with her reading of Ernest Hemingway's "The old man and the sea".
Plot.
In 1956 Batista's Cuba, sixteen-year-old Larita lives with her mother and her aunt's family in a ramshackle house outside Havana. From their garden they can see Ernest Hemingway's white mansion. At home, she adorns her walls with pictures of Elvis Presley and Tony Curtis, while at school she excels in her English class. Larita is delighted when her teacher suggests that she enters the scholarship exam for a university in America. Larita also happily dates a class mate, Victor, the president of the student association.
On a visit to a bookshop, she is given a copy of Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea", which she stars to read avidly, drawing parallels between the novel and her own life which she confines to her diary. At home, her family tease her about her academic aspirations, but it is also becomes clear that they resent the fact that while they work hard she studies and contributes nothing to their meager existence. The issue of finances is made more accurate when Larita is sent home because she is not wearing the correct school uniform. However, she passes the first round of scholarship exams and is invited to a reception for the finalist, trying to make herself as presentable as possible with the help of her relatives' sewing skills. She tells Victor that she is in the scholarship short list, which makes him angry since politically America represents everything he despises. That night Larita returns home to find that her uncle has been fired. 
At the scholarship interview, it is implied that her chances of a place are severely hampered by the fact that she is illegitimate and does not have the right social connections. In desperation, Larita decides to visit Hemingway to see if he will write a reference for her, but it turns out that he is away. Larita bitterly blames her mother for the fact that she is in disadvantage by poverty and illegitimacy. Meanwhile, at school, the student protest are becoming more frequent, culminating one afternoon in Victor's arrests. 
Later that year, Larita takes a job at a coffee bar where one evening the scholarship administrator walks by and recognizes her, unaware of her profound disappointment about the award. Undaunted by the knowledge that she may never have the education and career of her dreams, Larita, like the old fisherman in Hemingway's tale, is able to salvage some hope out of her despair.
DVD release.
The film was released on DVD in the USA in April 2002. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.

Vac7

Vacuolar segregation protein 7 is a protein that in yeast is encoded by the "VAC7" gene. VAC7 is a component of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, composed of ATG18, FIG4, FAB1, VAC14 and VAC7.
Function.
The PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex regulates both the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2). VAC7 activates FAB1 kinase for example during hyperosmotic shock and can elevate levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in the absence of VAC14 and FIG4. VAC7 is directly involved in vacuolar membrane scission and is required for normal vacuole acidification, inheritance and morphology.

Nikoulitzas Delphinas

Nikoulitzas Delphinas () was an 11th-century Byzantine magnate and local lord of Larissa, in Thessaly. He took part in a revolt initiated by the Vlachs of Thessaly in 1066.
He was the grandson of Nikulitsa, the governor of Servia and "archon" of the Vlachs of Hellas. The younger Nikoulitzas bore the rank of "protospatharios", but is not known to have had any official position.
Nikoulitzas had his own fortress with a garrison of men, and was one of the most powerful lords of Thessaly. The "Vlachs" and Slavs of the region started planning a revolt in 1065, prompted by the taxation increases and corruption in the same area. When Nikoulitzas heard this from his spies he went to Constantinople to warn the Emperor Constantine X Doukas, but the Emperor dismissed him and no measures were taken.
Upon returning to Larissa Nikoulitzas saw the growing movement and tried to talk the rebels out of it. They insisted on Nikoulitzas becoming their leader, as he had a fort and a private army. Nikoulitzas declined, as his two sons were in Constantinople, fearing they would come in harm's way. The rebels however forced Nikoulitzas to take a leadership position and the revolt began.
The revolt ended by negotiation, but the Emperor captured Nikoulitzas and imprisoned him in Amaseia, on the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor. His son-in-law was the writer Kekaumenos, whose "Strategikon" is the only source on him and the revolt.

The Škoda 1202 was a family car produced as a station wagon, light panel van and pick-up (Utility) by Czechoslovakian automaker AZNP at their subsidiary plant in Vrchlabí. A saloon (sedan) version was never produced. It was introduced in 1961 as a successor to the station wagon and pick-up versions of the Škoda 1201 and closely resembled the slightly smaller Octavia Combi.
The car was powered by a 1221 cc four-cylinder ohv water-cooled engine delivering 34.5 kW of output, inherited from its predecessor, and which later also found its way into the company’s Octavia model. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed prop shaft. A top speed of 100 km/h (63 mph) was quoted.
Although volumes were never high, the model remained in production until 1973. More modern models Škoda 1000 MB and Škoda 100, produced in main plant in Mladá Boleslav, featured rear engine configuration, which was not suitable for station wagon and van bodies.

United! (novel)

United! is a 1973 children's novel by prolific British author Michael Hardcastle. It is the second in a series of books focusing on the fortunes of fictitious youth football team Bank Vale United.
Plot summary.
"United!" follows youth football team Bank Vale United's attempts to improve their fortunes by buying a player from a rival team. Despite the fact that their team is amateur, United's impetuous striker Kevin Ripley believes there is no reason why they cannot pay for someone to come and join them. Kevin's team-mates Keith Nash and Gary Ansell, although sceptical, agree to the plan and the boys manage to raise the princely sum of £1 to purchase the talents of Nick Abel-Smith.
Despite Nick's obvious ability he is an unsettling influence and the Bank Vale players have to make a tough choice between success and loyalty. In addition to the usual football action Hardcastle includes a section on another of his interests, Motocross.

Re Parkes Garage (Swadlincote) Ltd

Re Parkes Garage (Swadlincote) Ltd 1 Ch 139 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning a voidable floating charge for past value.
Facts.
The liquidator of Parkes Garage (Swadlincote) Ltd sought a declaration that a floating charge on the company's property given by a debenture to a creditor, Mr Oswald Ling, was invalid. Parkes Garage Ltd, a garage proprietor and motor dealer, went insolvent in March 1927 (though this only transpired during litigation). On 15 June it executed a floating charge for a group of creditors (the trustee acting for the group was an accountant named Mr Oswald Ling). On 27 July the company sold part of the business and used that cash to pay off the group of creditors, with interest and a fee to Mr Ling. They endorsed a memorandum of discharge on the debenture. On 14 September, another creditor, Midland Bank, heard about these dealings and successfully petitioned for a winding up order. The liquidator alleged that under section 212 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 (now Insolvency Act 1986 section 245) the debenture for Ling was invalid because it was conferred more value than it was worth in the three months before insolvency.
The County Court judge held that the payment of the debts to the group of creditors was invalid. Mr Ling appealed.
Judgment.
Eve J held that it was not open to the judge to declare the debenture as a whole invalid, so that no debt would be repaid at all. He was only allowed to declare the charge invalid, because that is all that CCA 1908 section 212 (now IA 1986 section 245) affected. The charge could not be merged with the debt itself. Nevertheless, it might well be argued yet that the whole transaction was invalid as a fraudulent preference, but that was not done here.
Maugham J concurred.

Clock drive

In astronomy a clock drive is a regulatory mechanism used to move an equatorial mounted telescope along one axis to keep the telescope in exact sync with the apparent motion of the celestial sky (diurnal motion).
Overview.
Clock drives work by rotating a telescope mount's polar axis, the axis parallel to the Earth's polar axis (also called the right ascension axis) in the opposite direction to the Earth's rotation one revolution every 23 hours and 56 minutes (called "sidereal day"), thereby canceling that motion. This allows the telescope to stay fix on a certain point in the sky without having to be constantly re-aimed due to the Earth's rotation. The mechanism itself used to be clockwork but nowadays is usually electrically driven. Clock drives can be light and portable for smaller telescopes or can be exceedingly heavy and complex for larger ones such as the 60 inch telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory. Clock-driven equatorial platforms are sometimes used in non-tracking type mounts, such as altazimuth mounts.
History.
The original inventor of the clock drive is unknown, being an idea that was tried in several ways throughout history. In China in 1094, during the Song Dynasty, Su Song built a water driven clock tower that had many features including a 20 ton bronze armillary sphere that stayed in alignment with the heavens.
Different types of equatorial clock driven telescopes were built or proposed in the 17th and 18th century including English astronomer Robert Hooke's 1674 paper proposing their use in precision measurement, a clock driven aerial telescope objective lens constructed in 1685 by Italian-French astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini fitted with setting circles, and one supposedly built by English clockmaker and inventor George Graham early 18th century.
What is considered the first practical clock driven telescope was constructed in 1824, Joseph von Fraunhofer's ‘Great Dorpat’ refractor, a telescope that combined other innovations, such as an achromatic lens and Fraunhofer's "German equatorial mount", making it the prototype of all future large refracting telescopes. Early telescope clock drives used a clock work with falling weights and pendulums, almost like grandfather clocks. Over time the falling weights and pendulums were replaced by an electric motor.

Omi International Arts Center

Omi International Arts Center is a nonprofit international arts organization located in Columbia County in upstate New York. Omi International Arts Center was founded in 1992 by Francis Greenburger, a New York real estate developer, who serves as chairman of Art Omi, Inc., the residency’s parent foundation. The organization takes its name from Omi, a nearby hamlet in the Hudson River Valley two and a half hours from New York City. 
Omi International Arts Center offers four distinct residency programs: the Art Omi International Artists Residency for visual artists for three weeks in July; the Ledig House International Writers Residency for writers of fiction and non-fiction, critics and translators for up to two months in spring and fall; Music Omi International Musicians Residency, which brings together musicians, composers and improvisers in early August; and Dance Omi for dancers and choreographers in late summer. The programs encourage residents to collaborate and explore new avenues of expression and experiment with media and techniques not always available to them at home. Residents are provided with free room and board as well as a congenial place in which to work. Each year a limited number of fellowships are available to help artists with the costs of travel and art supplies. The residency welcomes talented applicants whether they are starting out, in mid-career or are already established. To date Omi has hosted over a thousand residents from 80 different countries and the United States.
Omi invites gallerists, critics, agents, publishers, curators and collectors to give talks and presentations. Their visits also benefit residents by providing them with exposure and access to the New York cultural scene. Omi regularly holds exhibitions, readings, concerts and dance performances to which the public is invited. In addition to the four residency programs, Omi International Arts Center is also home to The Fields Sculpture Park, Architecture Omi and Education Omi. 
The main compound is made up of three separate buildings with 18 guest rooms, three conference rooms, a library and communal spaces. Ledig House (named for the late German publisher H.M. Ledig-Rowohlt), a converted 1830 farmhouse, serves as Omi’s home and central meeting place. The principal work space consists of a two-story converted barn and several satellite sheds. The latest addition to the Omi campus is the Charles B. Benenson Visitors Center & Gallery, which opened to the public in the summer of 2008. The Center presents exhibitions of art and sculpture and includes a gift shop and café. The structure has been built using state-of-the-art ‘green’ technology. Omi’s facilities are available for rental for corporate retreats from December through March, when residency programs are not in session.
The Fields Sculpture Park, which is open to the public throughout the year, features over 100 permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Fields occupies approximately 150 acres of the Omi’s campus that has recently expanded to cover nearly 500 acres of farmland, woods and ponds. In the future architects will be invited to design structures ranging from pavilions to free-standing buildings, some of which may function as autonomous galleries or mini-museums.
Omi International Arts Center raises money primarily from philanthropic and corporate foundations and individual donors. Its major fundraising event is a theater benefit held each spring.

Frederick Field (chemist)

Frederick Field (2 August 1826–3 April 1885) was an English chemist. 
Early life.
He was born in Lambeth, London, the second son, by his second wife, of Charles Field, of the firm of J. C. & J. Field, candle manufacturers, etc. Educated at Denmark Hill grammar school and at Mr. Long's school at Stockwell (where he was a schoolfellow of Professor Odling), Field showed so strong a liking for chemistry that, on leaving school in 1843, he was placed in the laboratory of the Polytechnic Institution, then conducted by Dr. Ryan. On leaving the Polytechnic, Field entered into partnership with a chemist named Mitchell as an assayer and consulting chemist, but finding the need of further training spent some time as a student under Dr. Hoffmann in the Royal College of Chemistry in Oxford Street.
Field was one of the original members of the Chemical Society of London, started in 1846, and he read his first paper to that society in the following year.
Work in Chile.
In 1848 he accepted the post of chemist to some copper smelting works at Coquimbo in Chile. Some account of his work there is contained in his papers in the ‘Journal of the Chemical Society’ for 1850, ‘On the Examination of some Slags from Copper-smelting Furnaces,’ and ‘On the Ashes of the Cactus-plant,’ from which large quantities of carbonate of soda were obtained. In 1851 Field described a natural alloy of silver and copper, which had the appearance of nearly pure silver, and also discovered that a certain ore which occurred in large quantities near Coquimbo was in reality pure lapis lazuli, the first found in South America.
In 1852 Field was appointed manager of his company's works at Caldera, a new port to the north of Coquimbo. Before assuming this position he visited England and married a sister of (Sir) Frederick Abel, returning to Caldera in 1853, of which he was now appointed vice consul. The post involved many responsibilities in a land subject to revolutions. During the Russian War, Field also acted as the representative of France in that district.
In 1856 Field became chemist and sub-manager to the smelting works then established by Señor Urmeneta at Guayacan, which have since become one of the largest copper-smelting works in the world. In 1859 a revolution broke out in Chile. Field sent his wife and family to England, but himself remained and succeeded in preserving the establishment from injury.
Return to England.
In September 1859 he finally quit Chile for England. Soon after his arrival in London he was appointed lecturer on chemistry to St. Mary's Hospital (1860), and in 1862 became professor of chemistry in the London Institution. In the same year he was appointed chemist to the aniline colour works of Simpson, Maule, & Nicholson, a post which he held till 1866, when he became a partner in the old firm of his family - Messrs. J. C. & J. Field - in which he remained and of which he was senior partner at the time of his death. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863.
Death.
In 1876 Field's health began to fail, and after a long illness he died on 3 April 1885.
Writings.
Field wrote forty-three papers on scientific subjects for various periodicals, in addition to one written in conjunction with his brother-in-law, Sir F. A. Abel. Among them are:

<doc id="31170896" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31170896" title="Self-Sampling Assumption">
Self-Sampling Assumption

The self-sampling assumption (SSA), one of the two major schools of anthropic probability (the other being the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA)), states that:
For instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails they will create two, then we have two possible worlds, the first with one observer, the second with two. These worlds are equally probable, hence the SSA probability of being the first (and only) observer in the heads world is 1/2, that of being the first observer in the tails world is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of being the second observer in the tails world is also 1/4.
This is why SSA gives an answer of 1/2 probability of heads in the Sleeping Beauty problem.
Unlike SIA, SSA "is" dependent on the choice of reference class. If the agents in the above example were in the same reference class as a trillion other observers, then the probability of being in the heads world, upon the agent being told they are in the sleeping beauty problem, is formula_1 1/3, similar to SIA.
SSA may imply the doomsday argument depending on the choice of reference class. It is often used in anthropic reasoning.
Bostrom has suggested refining SSA to what he calls the Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA), which replaces "observers" in the SSA definition by "observer-moments". This coincides with the intuition that an observer who lives longer has more opportunities to experience herself existing, and it provides flexibility to refine reference classes in certain thought experiments in order to avoid paradoxical conclusions.

Soldan International Studies High School

Soldan International Studies High School (also known as Soldan High School) is a public magnet high school in the Academy neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri that is part of the St. Louis Public Schools. From its opening in 1909, Soldan was known for its wealthy and predominantly Jewish student population. Starting in the 1950s, the student population underwent a rapid change in demographics; by the mid-1960s, it was predominantly African American. In the early 1990s, the school was renovated and reopened as a magnet school with a focus on international relations.
Soldan currently offers its students several athletic and academic opportunities, including cross country, football, soccer, tennis, softball and volleyball. Its dropout rate is lower than the state average, and it is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. It has several notable alumni and former students, including politicians, authors, academics, and athletes.
History.
Construction and early years.
By the end of the 1890s, the population of the city had increased to more than 575,000, but since 1855, the St. Louis Public Schools had operated only one high school. To meet the need for greater space for high school students, the school district built two new high schools in 1904. Three years later, the district began building a fourth high school, which would become Soldan. Known during its construction as Union Avenue High School and renamed Soldan High School upon opening, the school was named for Frank Louis Soldan, the superintendent of St. Louis schools from 1895 until his death in 1908. Land acquisition costs for the building were $10,000, and construction cost $630,000.
William B. Ittner's design for the school received praise from the United States Bureau of Education for its attention to detail and to the needs of students It was designed to stylistically complement the nearby Clark School, which was designed in Gothic Revival style, with fittings and brickwork to suggest a Tudor period Gothic structure built in approximately 1620. With a capacity of 1,600 students, the building originally occupied an area of 288 by 256 feet and had three stories. The original design of the building had 41 classrooms, with 23 designed for 48 students and 18 for 35 students. The building's 18 science demonstration rooms and laboratories accommodated physiology, physiography, chemistry, botany, and physics, and in the basement, the building was designed with shops for woodworking, machining, and domestic science. The building also had four art rooms with skylights for studio work and three mechanical drafting rooms. The auditorium was the largest in the school system up to that time, with a seating capacity of 1,750, while the music room was built with a capacity of more than 300 students. To provide for ample physical education opportunities, the school was built with two gymnasiums. The school originally had two separate cafeterias for male and female students, although the practice of gender segregation at lunch was ended in the late 1940s.
During the 1930s and 1940s, the school became widely known as the city's "predominantly Jewish" school, with students from several notable or wealthy families in the Central West End. Although the school remained open on Jewish holidays, it often had significantly lower attendance. During its early years, Soldan graduated several notable individuals, including William McChesney Martin, Jr., the longest-serving Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, and Clark Clifford, a presidential adviser and United States Secretary of Defense. In 1922, Clifford and Martin were tennis doubles partners on the school's team. It also was during the 1920s that Tennessee Williams attended the school; in the 1940s, Soldan received notability as the school attended by some of the characters in Williams' "The Glass Menagerie". In 1948, the school received students after the closure of nearby rival Blewett High School, which was located one block from Soldan. After the merger, the school was briefly known as Soldan-Blewett; it returned to its original name in 1955.
Integration.
After the Brown v Board of Education decision in 1954, white parents and students of Soldan were among the most welcoming in the city toward integration. On the first day of integration, the school saw no protests, although national media personalities such as NBC evening news anchor John Cameron Swayze covered the event. Neither black nor white students reported significant incidents of racial tensions or problems, although black students often chose to eat in separate areas of the building from whites in the cafeteria. Despite the relatively uneventful process, Soldan experienced a rapid change in the demographics of its student population. During the 1940s, more than 90 percent of Soldan students were Jewish whites; by the early 1960s, the majority were African American. By 1965, only one white student attended Soldan, and many of the school's African American students had moved into the area from poorer neighborhoods such as Mill Creek Valley after urban renewal projects had displaced them.
Renovation and magnet status.
Starting in the late 1980s, St. Louis schools were required to improve physical conditions and create magnet schools as part of promoting a court-ordered desegregation program. The international studies magnet program originally was set for implementation at Northwest High School, but in August 1988, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh revised the district magnet school program. Among the changes was that Soldan would become a magnet school for international studies, and that it would become the highest part of a "cluster" of magnet schools focused on international relations, with lower-level schools having a focus on foreign languages.
Also part of the court desegregation plan was the physical improvement of city schools. Significant renovations to Soldan began in late 1989 and included interior renovations and the replacement of the school's two 2,000-square-foot gymnasiums with one 10,000-square-foot gymnasium. Due to the renovations, the building was closed from the 1990–1991 to the 1992–1993 school years, and its students were reassigned to Roosevelt High School. While the building was undergoing renovations, the city's Center for Management, Law and Public Policy magnet school was folded into the international studies program at Soldan. After three years of construction, the renovated building reopened on September 2, 1993. However, an electrical rewiring of the school and the installation of a synchronized clock system, which were to be completed as part of the renovation work, were not finished until early 1995 owing to a contractual dispute with an electrical company.
After the conversion to a magnet school, Soldan became home to a significant international student population. By 1996, nearly 40 percent of students were from 32 countries other than the United States. As part of the merger of the Center for Management, Law and Public Policy, the school became the only high school in the state to have a law library as part of its facilities. During the 2010–2011 school year, as part of a district budget process, Soldan began to accept seventh and eighth grade students.
Current status.
In 2011 it had an enrollment of 801, making it the 119th largest high school in Missouri.
Activities.
For the 2010–2011 school year, the school offered seven activities approved by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA): boys' and girls' cross country, 11-man football, boys' and girls' soccer, girls' tennis, girls' softball, and girls' volleyball. In addition to its current activities, Soldan students have won several state championships, including:
The school also has produced one tennis doubles state champion and three boys' outdoor track and field individual events champions.
Demographics.
In the 2009–2010 school year, Soldan had an enrollment of 749 students with 53.6 full-time-equivalent teachers, for a student-teacher ratio of 13.97. In 2010, more than 80 percent of students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. Since 2006, more than 65% of the student population at Soldan has been African American and the white student population has declined by roughly half.
Academic and discipline issues.
Soldan has a low dropout rate; for the 2009–2010 school year, 1.8 percent of students dropped out compared to the Missouri state dropout rate of 3.5 percent. Soldan also has a discipline incident rate of 3.1 percent, which is comparable to the average Missouri rate. Since the passage of No Child Left Behind in 2001, Soldan has met the requirements for adequate yearly progress (AYP) twice. In 2006, Soldan students achieved 17.2 percent proficiency in communication arts, allowing the school to meet AYP via making satisfactory progress. In 2009, the school met AYP in communication arts via a confidence interval.

Chung Wai-ming

Chung Wai-ming (), MBE (17 July 1931 - 27 November 2009) was an experienced Hong Kong broadcaster. He was dubbed by his fellows as 'Big Brother Chung' and earned the title 'the King of Broadcasting' by his performance.
Chung started his career as a broadcaster in 1947. Throughout his career, he had worked for Rediffusion Television, the United States Information Service (USIS) and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). In 1992, Chung became the first ethnic Chinese broadcaster to be appointed as an MBE; in 1998, he was presented The Life Time Achievement in Broadcasting Award by the RTHK.
Family.
Chung Chi-ming, one of his younger brothers, is also a broadcaster in Hong Kong.
Biography.
Chung left school at the age of 11. He first worked for the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company; he then started learning to be a film director at San Yuet Pictures in Hong Kong. In 1947, he participated in the production of a radio drama for the first time in the RTHK's "The Resurrected Rose". In 1952, he joined Rediffusion and became a programme director; he was mainly responsible for film production. At the same time, he was also an amateur participant for the recording of radio dramas. Later, he decided to focus on radio drama because his heavy workload made him unable to participate in both film production and radio drama. He participated in the production of various radio dramas of different genres and earned the title of 'the King of Broadcasting'.
Chung wanted to resign from Rediffusion and join the USIS, but Rediffusion objected to that. Finally, after discussions between the USIS and Rediffusion, the USIS allowed him to work for Rediffusion, the RTHK and Commercial Radio Hong Kong outside work time. In 1970, Chung joined the Hong Kong Civil Service as a programme officer at the RTHK.
In the late 1980s, Hong Kong saw the huge influx of Vietnamese refugees. The Hongkongese government implemented the policy of 'Comprehensive Plan of Action' on 16 June 1988 and the RTHK started to broadcast the famous 'Bắt đầu từ nay' announcement. Chung was the broadcaster reading out the Cantonese part of the announcement.
Chung retired in 1991. Yet, he continued to be a programme host in the RTHK. He became the first ethnic Chinese broadcaster to be awarded the MBE medal in 1992; in 1998, he was awarded The Life Time Achievement in Broadcasting Award by the RTHK for his contribution to broadcasting.
In the morning of 27 November 2009, Chung fainted in Prince Edward Station of Hong Kong MTR. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital and was certified dead in the same morning at 11:36. Before his death, he was a host for the RTHK's programmes targeted at elderly audience.

<doc id="31170942" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31170942" title="Battle of Araviana">
Battle of Araviana

The Battle of Araviana was a cavalry action fought during the War of the Two Peters on 22 September 1359. Eight hundred Aragonese horse, many of them Castilian exiles in service of the Crown of Aragon under Henry of Trastámara, had launched a "cavalgada" in Castilian territory when, near the Castilian town of Ágreda, confronted and routed a Castilian force under Juan Fernández de Henestrosa set to guard the frontier. Numerous Castilian noblemen and knights were killed, including Henestrosa, while many other were captured.
Background.
The War of the Two Peters broke in 1356 when a squadron of 9 Catalan galleys under Francesc de Perellós sent by the king Peter IV of Argon to assist the House of Valois in their succession conflict with the House of Plantagenet, captured near Sanlúcar de Barrameda two ships under the flag of the Republic of Genoa, at that time engaged in a war against the Republic of Venice and the Crown of Aragon. The king Peter I of Castile, who was present at Sanlúcar during the event, feel offended and demanded Perellós the free of the Genoese vessels.
Perellós refused Peter's demands and was therefore chased by Castilian warships till the Portuguese coast. Peter of Castile complained afterwards to the king Peter IV Aragon, but as he did not obtained the desired results, he declared war on the Crown of Aragon. He promptly began the operations besieging by sea the Valencian town of Guardamar, unsuccessfully, and launching some "cavalgadas" through the frontier. In 1359 the Castilian fleet raided the Valencian and Catalan coasts, not obtaining satisfying results but menacing the town of Alicante. Peter IV, seeing that his southern frontier was in danger, dispatched several horse companies led by Pere de Xèrica to defend the area around Orihuela, Crevillente and Elche, and also ordered all the fortresses to be provisioned with enough ammunitions and supplies.
Battle.
Over the following months the action displaced to the Aragonese border with Castille. In September, Henry of Trastámara, pretender to the Castilian throne and half-broder and rival of Peter I, together with his younger brother Tello and several members of the Aragonese House of Luna, as Pedro, Juan Martínez and Fray Artal de Luna, launched a raid in Castilian territory invading the country near the town of Almazán. This force consisting of about 800 horse, encountered a considerable larger Castilian company of 1,500 horse led by the uncle of Peter I, Juan Fernández de Henestrosa. Refusing to run for cover, Henry offered battle near Ágreda. The fought which ensued was a brief affair and concluded with the routing of the Castilian force. Among those Castilians who were killed were found Juan Fernández de Henestrosa.
Other signaled casualties were Gomez Suárez de Figueroa, Fernando García Duque, Pedro Bermúdez, Gonzalo Sánchez de Ulloa and Juan González de Bahabon. Many noblemen and knights as Iñigo López de Orozco, Fernando Rodríguez de Villalobos, Juan Gómez de Bahabon, Hurtado Díaz de Mendoza and Díaz Sánchez de Porra, all of them Knights of the Band, were captured. Also the Castilian banner was taken when his bearer, Gonzalo Sánchez de Ulloa, was killed.
Aftermath.
Peter I was informed of the defeat of his armies at his arrival on Seville from the Valencian coast. The Aragonese armies won another victory shortly after at Tarazon, but a few months later, in the spring of 1360, Henry was defeated by Peter I himself at the so-called First Battle of Nájera. On this occasion Henry was supported by 1,200 cavalry and 2,000 cavalry, while Peter had a much larger army of 5,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. Though Peter won the first day he decided to withdraw and Henry was able to continue offering battle. However, Castille took the initiative and focused the operations at the southern Valencian frontier. The town of Orihuela was subsequently raided by 800 Castilian and Moor cavalry, but a relief force of 250 horse led by Count Alfons of Ribagorza and Denia dispersed them and recovered the lost ground.

Dockers is a British feature-length television drama produced for Channel 4 about the struggles of a small group of Liverpool dockers who were sacked and subsequently spent 2 years picketing during the Liverpool Dockers' Strike of 1995 to 1998.
Although the credited screenwriters for the drama were Liverpool screenwriter Jimmy McGovern and Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh the drama was largely written by sacked dock workers and previous union members under the supervision of the two screenwriters. This unusual writing method was considered an experiment in 'democratic television' and was documented in a separate channel 4 documentary, "Writing the Wrongs".

Antonietta (novel)

Antonietta is a novel written by American Pulitzer-Prize winning author John Hersey. Published in 1991, the novel traces the history of the titular violin, a fictitious creation of Antonio Stradivari, recounting its usage under multiple owners interspersed with what Hersey describes as "intermezzi", interludes of fact. Hersey's 25th novel, it was the last he released before his death.
Overview.
As a novel following the history of an object, it is in the style of a popular 18th century genre termed "novel of circulation". The novel covers the history of the violin Antonietta from its creation by Antonio Stradivari in 1699. Beginning with an overview of the creation of the violin, named in honor of Stradivari's second wife, the novel follows the violin through multiple owners, focusing on its influence of their work and those around them. Among the owners of the violin featured in the novel are Mozart, who possessed the violin in the late 18th century and composed a sonata for it; Pierre Baillot, who describes its impact on the composition of Berlioz; Pavel Federovsky, who played in trio with Stravinksy; Spenser, a modern businessman in Martha's Vineyard; and Hersey himself, who claimed to have purchased the violin with advance money for the novel itself. In each section, the writer adopts a writing style to mirror the personality and perspective of the owner.
Critical reception.
The novel was critically well received. Publishers Weekly termed it a "delightful tour de force". While suggesting that it may not appeal to those who did not appreciate classical music, "The Milwaukee Journal" described the book as "original and vibrant", concluding that "the joint appeal of passion in music and irony in history is universal, and, I should think, irresistible." Publishers Weekly opined that while even non-music fans might enjoy the novel, which "satisfies on several levels", "the music lover will be doubly enchanted by a virtuoso performance." "The Victoria Advocate" summarized it as "a rare novel indeed, and for music lovers a gem of sparkling brilliance."
Similar stories.
It has been speculated that the novel was an influence on the 1998 Canadian film "The Red Violin", which similarly traces the history of an evocative violin through multiple owners. The film's producers indicate that although they became aware of the similarities in story concept during the writing of the film, the writers were instructed not to read the book to avoid any unconscious influence.

Carrier Dove (schooner)

The Carrier Dove was a 4-masted schooner built by the Hall Brothers in Port Blakely in 1890. She worked in the West coast lumber trade and in fishing.
Career of 1890 schooner "Carrier Dove".
In 1893, "Carrier Dove" was active in the foreign lumber trade out of British Columbia. The Alaska Packers Association also described "Carrier Dove" as a "salmon vessel" which had sustained a partial loss at sea amounting to $11,500, in 1893. In 1894, she loaded lumber at Nanaimo under Capt. Brandt. She was used for fishing between 1902-1907. On Nov. 19, 1903, while at sea in the vicinity of Juneau, AK, a seaman named John Macas jumped overboard. "A boat was launched and man picked up, but died soon afterwards."
The Seattle-Alaska Fish Co. began business in Seattle in 1902, using for its home station the old West Seattle plant of the Oceanic Packing Co. The first year the schooner "Carrier Dove" was the only vessel outfitted, but in 1903 the schooner "Nellie Colman" was added. In 1906 the latter vessel was sold, her place being taken by the schooner "Maid of Orleans." Only the "Carrier Dove" was outfitted in 1907, but in 1908 she was sold and the "Maid of Orleans" outfitted. In 1910 the company was absorbed by the King & Winge Codfish Co., of Seattle. 
"Carrier Dove" took a load of lumber from Masset Inlet, B.C. to Port Adelaide in 1919-1920. 
Schooner "Carrier Dove" was wrecked after striking a reef near the Hawaiian island of Molokai on Nov. 21, 1921. She had become "waterlogged and unmanageable while on a voyage from Tonga Island for San Francisco with copra." The "Pacific Marine Review" reported that the loss of the "Moore schooner "Carrier Dove"" was estimated at "$77,000 cargo, no hull."
The American schooner "Carrier Dove", wrecked on the Island of Molokai, Hawaii, November 2, was "lost" twice before, once in September, 1903, on the China coast, and again in February, 1920, during a hurricane that cast her on a reef of Fiji. She was salved both times. No salvage of the latest wreck is possible.
"Two tons of copra from the wreck were gathered up four days later on the Kai-lua beach on Oahu." The wreck was still "visible on the ocean bottom" as of 2002.
1854 Great Lakes schooner "Carrier Dove".
An earlier schooner named "Carrier Dove" was built in 1854 at Wolfe Island, Ontario. She sunk on the American side of Lake Ontario March 3, 1876, when the boat was "swept from her moorings and dragged underneath another schooner."

County Road 61.
County Road 61 is a county route, which runs from the intersection of Minnesota 61 Expressway and North Shore Scenic Drive in Two Harbors, Minnesota, and follows the North Shore Scenic Drive to Duluth on Saint Louis County Road 61, passing through the communities of Larsmont and Knife River in Lake County. County 61 is more commonly known and signed as North Shore Scenic Drive between Duluth and Two Harbors and is also known as Scenic 61.
County 61 (between Duluth and Two Harbors) was commissioned as U.S. 61 in 1926, ready for use by 1929, and paved by 1940. Until the expressway between Duluth and Two Harbors was constructed inland in the 1960s, County 61 (then U.S. 61) had served as the principal route between Duluth and Two Harbors. Formerly known as U.S. 61, the state turned over management of the road to Saint Louis and Lake counties in the 1960s and the two counties then designated the route "County 61".
The course for Grandma's Marathon follows this road route annually in June.

<doc id="31171045" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31171045" title="Feng Hongduo">
Feng Hongduo

Feng Hongduo (馮弘鐸) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who controlled the Sheng Prefecture (昇州, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) region from 893 to 902.
Background.
Feng Hongduo was originally from Lianshui (漣水, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), and he served as an officer at Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which Lianshui belonged to. Once, when Feng was accused of impropriety by circuit administrators, fellow officer Zhang Xiong, who was also from Lianshui, spoke on his behalf, and Zhang's doing so caused Ganhua's military governor ("Jiedushi") Shi Pu to suspect both of them. In 886, knowing that Shi suspected them, Zhang and Feng gathered 300 men and left Ganhua with them, crossing the Yangtze River to attack Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which then belonged to Zhenhai Circuit. They captured it, and Zhang claimed the title of prefect. Eventually, he was able to gather an army reaching the size of 50,000, with 1,000 ships, and called his army Tiancheng Army (天成軍).
Service under Zhang Xiong.
Zhang Xiong was eventually dislodged from Su Prefecture by Xu Yue (徐約) and roved down the Yangtze River to East China Sea and then back up the Yangtze; Feng followed him. Zhang eventually settled in at Shangyuan (上元, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), and was given the title of prefect of a new Sheng Prefecture, with its seat at Shangyuan, by then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong. After Zhang's death in 893, Feng succeeded him as the prefect of Sheng.
As ruler of Sheng Prefecture.
It was said that Feng Hongduo, as the prefect of Sheng, was capable in riding and archery, and was also a good speaker, speaking as if he were a learned Confucian scholar. He also possessed the strongest fleet of the region, constructed from good, durable wood that he obtained from afar; the ships were massive and known as "tower ships" (樓船). He made peace with Yang Xingmi, who by that point had taken control of Huainan. However, at one point, he sent his follower Shang Gongnai (尚公乃) to Yang, demanding that Yang turn over control of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to him. When Yang refused, Shang made the comment to Yang, "Lord, you reject our demand, but can you withstand the tower ship fleet?" Still, it appeared that no major conflict between Yang and Feng resulted from this incident.
In 902, Emperor Zhaozong, who was then under the controls of the eunuch Han Quanhui and the warlord Li Maozhen at Li Maozhen's Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), which was then under siege by another major warlord, Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), sent the imperial emissary Li Yan to the southeastern circuits to encourage the warlords there to join under Yang's command and attack Zhu. As part of the edicts that Li Yan promulgated, Feng was given the title of military governor of Wuning (武寧, i.e., Ganhua).
Meanwhile, by this point, Feng had felt trapped between Yang and Yang's vassal, Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), but as he felt that he could depend on his tower ship fleet, he did not join the Huainan power bloc. Tian decided to try to conquer Feng's territory, so he hired the shipbuilders who had previously built Feng's ships to build ships for him, despite those shipbuilders' objections that Tian's territory lacked the type of wood that Feng used and therefore resultant ships would not be as durable. (Tian's response to them was, "Just build them; all I need to do is to use them once.") Tian thus quickly had a fleet built, ready to engage Tian.
Feng realized Tian's intentions, and his subordinates Feng Hui (馮暉) and Yan Jian (顏建) suggested that he attack Tian first. He therefore activated his fleet and headed southwest on the Yangtze, claiming to be readying to attack Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but was instead intending to attack Tian. When Yang sent emissaries to try to stop him from attacking Tian, he refused to listen. However, when he engaged Tian's fleet at Geshan (葛山, in modern Xuancheng), Tian dealt him a major defeat.
Having been defeated by Tian, Feng Hongduo gathered the remnants of his fleet and planned to head down the Yangtze to East China Sea. Yang was concerned that he might be able to rebuild his forces and become a threat later, and therefore sent messengers to assure him that if he submitted, he and his army would be well-treated. Feng's army wanted to accept the offer, and when Yang, unarmed, thereafter went to Dongtang (東塘, in modern Yangzhou) to meet Feng, Feng and his army was impressed, and therefore joined Yang's army at Huainan. Yang made him the deputy military governor of Huainan. He thereafter served Yang without failure. That was the last historical record on Feng, and it is not known when he died.

Equatorial platform

An equatorial platform or equatorial table is an equatorial telescope mount in the form of a specially designed platform that allows any device sitting on it to track astronomical objects in the sky on an equatorial axis. They are used to give equatorial tracking to any device sitting on them, from small cameras up to entire observatory buildings. They are often used with altazimuth mounted telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, to overcome that type of mount's inability to track the night sky.

Many types of equatorial platform have been used over the years. The mid-1960s saw the introduction of the Russian AFU-75 satellite-tracking camera mounted on a three point equatorial platform. Two of the points were aligned on a polar axis while the third was a jackscrew actuator to drive the platform. This gave the mount a few minutes of equatorial tracking to allow stars in the field of view to be imaged as points for accurate measurement. 
The late 1970s saw the publication of Adrien Poncet's "Poncet Platform", a very simple design for amateur telescope makers that used a pivot point and an inclined plane that made a very low profile "table". This type of mount has been a popular retrofit for altazimuth mounted telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, adding equatorial tracking for high magnification work and astrophotography. 
Since the Poncet Platform's simple bearing surfaces suffers from high mechanical loadings when used with heavy telescopes or at low geographic latitudes more sophisticated equatorial platform designs were invented in the 1980s. One was Alan Gee's design that uses a cylindrical bearing surface and a pivot making a mount similar in structure to a horseshoe mount that has been "cut flat". In 1988 Georges D'Autume proposed a more sophisticated design which used conical bearings surfaces all around to raise the height of the "virtual polar axis" to make the mount better balanced for heavier loads. 
Poncet based platforms are usually designed to track for 1 hour (15° of tilt) since longer tracking exceeds their range of motion and could cause the instrument on top to topple off. At the end of their drive limit the mount has to be pivoted back to the east to reset the clock drive mechanism.

Zinnia elegans

Zinnia elegans (common zinnia, youth-and-old-age), an annual flowering plant of the genus "Zinnia", is one of the best known zinnias.
Description.
The uncultivated plant grows to about 30 in (76 cm) in height. It has solitary flower heads about 2 in (5 cm) across on stems resembling daisies. The purple florets surround black and yellow discs. The lanceolate leaves are opposite the flower heads.
History.
The species was collected in 1789 at Tixtla, Guerrero, by Sessé and Mociño. It was formally described as "Zinnia violacea" by Cavanilles in 1791. Jacquin described it again in 1792 as "Zinnia elegans", which was the name that Sessé and Moçiño had used in their manuscript of "Plantae Novae Hispaniae", which was not published until 1890. The genus was named by Carl von Linné after the German botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn, who described the species now known as "Zinnia peruviana" in 1757 as "Rudbeckia foliis oppositis hirsutis ovato-acutis, calyce imbricatus, radii petalis pistillatis". Linné realized that it was not a "Rudbeckia".
Habitat.
Wild "Zinnia elegans" is a desert plant found in Mexico. Garden varieties may escape and naturalise.
Habits.
Flowering occurs between spring to fall.
Cultivation.
The garden zinnia was bred via hybridisation from the wild form. Zinnias are popular garden plants with hundreds of cultivars in many flower colors, sizes and forms. There are giant forms with flower heads up to 6 in (15 cm) in diameter. 
Flower colours range from white and cream to pinks, reds, and purples, to green, yellow, apricot, orange, salmon, and bronze. Some are striped, speckled or bicoloured. There are "pom-pom" forms that resemble dahlias. Sizes range from dwarf varieties of less than 6 inches (15 cm) in height to 3 feett (0.9 m) tall. The powdery mildew common to zinnias in humid climates is less common recently developed varieties, which are resistant. 
Other cultivars include 'Magellan', 'Envy Double', 'Fireworks', 'Purple Prince', 'Blue Point Purple', 'Profusion Cherry', 'Profusion Orange', 'Star Gold', 'Star Orange', and several white-flowered types such as 'Crystal White', 'Purity', and 'Profusion White'. Mixed-color seed selections are available.
Growth.
Zinnias grow easily and prefer well-drained, loamy soil and full sun. They grow best in dry, warm, frost-free regions, and many kinds are drought-tolerant. Some may be grown indoors.

Cape Newenham Air Force Station

Cape Newenham Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-05, LRR ID: A-09) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located west-southwest of Togiak, Alaska. 
The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.
History.
Cape Newenham AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska.
A construction contract was awarded to Haddock Engineers, Ltd., on 13 June 1950. Work was started on 12 September, and considerable construction difficulties. The only means of getting construction materials and supplies to the site was by barge or Navy LSTs, however this was restricted to when the sea was not frozen and had to be unloaded north from the proposed site . Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort.
The site became operational in April 1954, two years behind schedule. Cape Newenham was initially maintained by Detachment F-5, 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (AC&W Gp). In 1952, Alaskan Air Command (AAC) decided to upgrade the detachments to squadrons. The 794th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W Sq) was activated on 8 December 1952 with 107 military personnel authorized. However, due to delays in construction, the squadron operated at limited manning until the site became operational. 
The station had its main camp in a valley between peaks. Recreational features included hobby shops and recreation rooms, plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The station had a tramway connecting the base station with the radar antennas located on a mountain peak at 2,300 feet. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter. A new riblet type tramway was installed in 1962. 
Cape Newenham AFS was originally equipped with an AN/FPS-3 Search Radar which was later modified as the AN/FPS-93A Search Radar. The station provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at King Salmon AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. An AN/FYQ-9 Semiautomatic Data Processing and Display System was installed and became operational in July 1965, eliminating the need to pass track data manually.
Cape Newenham AFS was resupplied annually since 1950 by sealift. Bulk cargo was delivered across the beach in landing craft, while fuel was pumped ashore to storage tanks. It was part of the annual Cool Barge remote resupply operations originally known as Mona Lisa. The name was changed to Cool Barge in 1967. A runway was built in 1952 , north-northeast to facilitate the transportation of personnel and critical cargo.
The squadron was assigned to various headquarters, including AAC. On 15 October 1977, the squadron was reassigned from Headquarters, AAC to the 531st AC&W Gp upon the reactivation of the latter. The Group was redesignated the 11th Tactical Control Group on 1 July 1981. 
Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Cape Newenham site was activated in December 1957. It was inactivated in March 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm.
Construction of a composite building was begun in late 1975. The $11.7 million facility was accepted by the Alaska District Corps of Engineers in October 1980. However, occupancy was delayed until July 1981 because of safety deficiencies and changes in design.
On 1 October 1977, AAC, after a trial period, implemented a site support contract with RCA Services as part of an Air Force-wide effort to reduce remote tours. Eighty military positions were deleted. The remaining 14 were primarily in operations. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Cape Newenham received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's Seek Igloo program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. 
No longer needed, the 794th AC&W Sq was inactivated on 1 November 1983 and the station redesignated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. The composite building was modified to house personnel and equipment, and the other facilities were disposed of. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Cape Newenham LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC.
In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated "Operation Clean Sweep", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005.
Current status.
Today very little of the former Cape Newenham Air Force Station remains. It is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is generally unattended; a few civilian contractor maintenance personnel needed for continued operation access the site by the Cape Newenham LRRS Airport when needed to maintain the radar system.
Climate.
Cape Newenham has the typical subarctic climate of most of Alaska, though owing to the maritime influence of the Bering Sea it borders on a polar climate despite receiving an amount of precipitation one would expect more of an oceanic location.

Alex Taylor (Edmonton)

Alexander Taylor (May 17, 1853 – February 12, 1916) was a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor and politician. He is credited as being one of the founders of the city of Edmonton. Taylor was born in on May 17, 1853 in Ottawa, Ontario, and came to Edmonton in 1877. Shortly after his arrival in Edmonton, Taylor established the first telegraph, telephone, and electricity systems. Edmonton asked the Bell Telephone Company to provide services in 1883, but were just offered "a few telephones" and no telephone exchange at a great cost, Taylor, who, at the time was working for the Dominion Telegraph and Signal Service proposed running a telephone line from his office to St. Albert, which was 14 km away. He then purchased two telephones made of Spanish mahogany, and asked store owner Henry William McKenney of St. Albert to keep the device in St. Albert. On January 3, 1885 the two tested the line, the first on Northern Alberta. In 1891, Taylor co-founded Edmonton's first electric company, the Edmonton Electric Light Company. Taylor also co-founded Edmonton's first newspaper, the "Edmonton Bulletin" with Frank Oliver in 1880. Taylor also served on the Edmonton Public School Board from 1899 to 1909, and was the chairman of the board in 1907.
In 1904, ill health prompted Taylor to sell his telephone company to the City of Edmonton for $17,000, which later became known as Edmonton Telephones. Taylor died on February 12, 1916. He is buried in the Edmonton Cemetery.

Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd

Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd Ch 148 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning voidable floating charges for past value. It holds that a floating charge can harden when it secures a debt in an overdraft account, when the bank keeps the facility open as a company takes money out and puts money in.
Facts.
The liquidator of Yeovil Glove Co Ltd, a glove manufacturer in Yeovil, sued National Provincial Bank Ltd to rescind a floating charge taken within 12 months before insolvency. The bank's floating charge was to secure Yeovil Glove's overdraft, which (on top of debts of £94,000 to other unsecured creditors) had grown to £67,000 when the bank took fixed security and then as money was still unpaid, a floating charge. Over the next year, Yeovil Glove paid £111,000 and drew out (through cheques written to other people that the bank was honouring) £110,000. At the time the Insolvency Act 1986 section 245 (formerly Companies Act 1948 section 322) read that a floating charge was voidable ‘except to the amount of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge.’ The bank contended that because more money had been paid out of the account than was covered by the charge (albeit that new debts were run up) the charge was not voidable. As in "Clayton's case", money going into an account is presumed to discharge the last debt first. So money had been advanced to the company to a greater extent than the charge, and the turnover of money converted the old value given into new value.
Plowman J held that the ability to make drawings after was good consideration for the charge.
Judgment.
Harman LJ noted the liquidator’s argument, that because no cash or promise to pay cash was made when the debenture was made, there was no consideration except the bank’s immediate forbearance. But he held that the act of the bank in meeting the company’s cheques was equivalent to money given, relying partly on a decision by Romer J in "Re Thomas Mortimer Ltd". By the rule in "Clayton’s case", the bank could claim the whole £67,000 was cash advanced subsequently to the creation of the charge, so the security was valid. His judgment went as follows

Miss 1917

Miss 1917 is a musical revue with a book by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse, music by Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and others, and lyrics by Harry B. Smith, Otto Harbach, Henry Blossom and others. Made up of a string of vignettes, the show features songs from such musicals as "The Wizard of Oz", "Three Twins", "Babes in Toyland", "Ziegfeld Follies" and "The Belle of New York".
Background.
In 1916, Charles Dillingham and Florenz Ziegfeld produced "The Century Girl", with music by Irving Berlin. Despite mildly positive reviews, the show closed without recouping its investment. On their next production, which was to be called "Miss 1917", they hired Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert to compose the score and Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse to collaborate on the book. Kern and Bolton had collaborated on the Princess Theatre musicals, including "Very Good Eddie" (1915). British humorist and playwright Wodehouse then joined them for several innovative musicals there, including Oh, Boy! (1917).
Involvement of George Gershwin.
The show is mostly known today as George Gershwin's introduction to musical theatre. During rehearsals for "Miss 1917", Gershwin conducted the pit orchestra and played the piano. He was hired in October 1917, being paid $35 each week. As the rehearsal period extended, Gershwin earned more money. He would later record Kern's "The Land Where the Good Songs Go", which was used in the revue, as a piano roll in January 1918.
While working for the show, Gershwin and his brother Ira Gershwin befriended Herbert and Kern, keeping "in contact with some of the major figures on Broadway". Sunday night concerts held in New York City by the show's cast introduced Gershwin's "There's More to a Kiss Than the Sound" and "You-oo, Just You", both with lyrics by Irving Caesar. "Gershwin had begun work on Broadway as a rehearsal pianist for the Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert musical "Miss 1917". Within months, his talent as a composer was noticed by everyone in the show and he was quickly put under contract by Harms Music. His involvement with "Miss 1917" brought him to the attention of music producer Harry Askins, who in turn mentioned him to Max Dreyfus, "one of the giants of music publishing".
1917 Broadway production.
The producers of the show "had demanded extremely elaborate staging for the revue", so no out-of-town tryouts were held, and the show premiered directly on Broadway on 5 November 1917, at the Century Theatre. The production was staged, directed and supervised by Ned Wayburn, with choreography by Adolph Bohm. The creative team also included set designer Joseph Urban, who built a rotating thrust stage for the theatre. Costume design was attributed to eight designers, including Paul Chaflin, Willy Pogany, and Max Weldy.
The original cast starred comedian Lew Fields, Andrew Tombes and Vivienne Segal. it also included George White, Ann Pennington, Charles King, Bessie McCoy Davis, Bert Savoy, Irene Castle, Marion Davies and the comedic team Van and Schenck. Kern originally wanted Segal to sing "They Didn't Believe Me" in the revue, though Dillingham and Herbert preferred her to sing "Kiss Me Again". Segal's siding with the latter caused tension among the creative team. According to a member of the production crew, technical rehearsals were interrupted several times due to disagreements in staging and choreography; at one point, Kern sought to close the show early, though Ziegfeld wouldn't have it.
The show got rave reviews. Although Castle was singled out for praise by reviewers, she was unhappy performing on stage without her husband and usual dance partner Vernon Castle: "I found myself hopelessly lost as a solo number. I had no training for dancing alone and I should never have tried it." Though successful with critics, the revue failed to attract an audience; at least not enough of one to pay for the lavish production. Castle, White and others were let go by the producers, but the show still foundered in its out-of-the-way theatre. It closed on 5 January 1918, after only six weeks of performances.
Subsequent events.
A month after "Miss 1917" closed on Broadway, on 21 February 1918, items used in the show were sold in an auction, raising $11,300, according to "The New York Times". Most of the items for auction were bought by J. J. Shubert. The following day, Sam Harrison of the New Amsterdam Theatre bought the performing rights to the musical. A London transfer, planned for March 1920, as well as a US national tour were cancelled. According to "The New York Times", the creative team would not allow Ziegfeld to stage the show internationally due to planned major staging and plot changes that he hoped would make the humour more accessible to international audiences.
Recordings.
Although no official cast recording was made, brief excerpts from some of the songs used in "Miss 1917" can be heard on the compilation album, "Jerome Kern: Silver Linings", which was officially released on 22 July 2008.

Dutton's Books was an independent bookstore located in Valley Village in the San Fernando Valley. It was known for its friendly and knowledgeable staff, sizeable and affordable used book collection, rare books, and its owners Dave and Judy Dutton. There were two Dutton's locations in the San Fernando Valley, the other located in Burbank, California, but the Valley Village location was the larger of the two. 
Opened in 1960, on the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Magnolia Boulevard in a former liquor store, by Dave Dutton's parents, the store was eventually taken over by Dave and his wife Judy in the mid-1970s. It served as one of the San Fernando Valley's best independent bookstores. They offered services such as book buyback, book signings, and in-store reading events with community authors. Owners Dave and Judy were extremely knowledgeable and were happy to speak with customers regarding literature, Southern California history or any other topic. The store also provided many books for various movie and television sets. Steady customers, friendly staff, and welcoming owners made the store an ideal place to while away a Sunday afternoon. 
As with most independent bookstores, the impact of discount stores such as Walmart and Costco as well as competition from Amazon.com led to the closing of Dutton's in 2006. The Burbank location closed a year earlier. While there are still some independent bookstores located in the San Fernando Valley, the loss of Dutton's was a difficult blow to owners, customers, and employees alike.

Škoda 1201

The Škoda 1201 was a family car produced by Czech automaker AZNP at their plant in Mladá Boleslav. Saloon and estate versions were offered along with a panel van. The car appeared in 1954 as a successor to the Škoda 1200. It inherited its predecessor's steel ponton format body. One difference was the fitting of flashing turn signal indicators, whereas the 1200 had incorporated semaphore style trafficators in its front wings: subsequent retro-fitting of flashing indicators to old 1200s has left this as an imperfect method for distinguishing between the two models, however.
The car was powered by a four-cylinder 1221 cc ohv water-cooled engine producing at maximum power 33 kW at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed prop shaft. Top speeds of between 90 km/h (56 mph) and 105 km/h (65 mph) were quoted.
The 1201 was available as a four-door saloon and as a three- or five-door station wagon. A panel van (light delivery van) and pick-up truck version were also produced.
Production ended in 1961, which was also the year in which production began of the successor model, the Škoda 1202.

Meteor Defence System (Ringworld)

In the Ringworld series by Larry Niven, set in Known Space, the Ringworld is a ring 150 million kilometers in radius, 960 million kilometers in circumference, 1.6 million kilometers wide, and 1 kilometer thick, built by the Pak. It is first visited by the team of humans Louis Wu and Teela Brown, Speaker-To-Animals (a Kzin), and the Pierson's Puppeteer Nessus. Throughout the novel Ringworld, the team cannot understand how the species who built the Ringworld expected to defend it against a variety of threats such as meteors ripping it apart to invasion by aliens. The Ringworld Meteor Defence System was built by the Pak to protect the Ringworld against these threats.
The Meteor Defence System is built into the material of the Ringworld. A network of superconducting cables run through the entire ring. This network of cables can be used to create a magnetic field to act upon the sun of the Ringworld, causing it to flare. A superthermal laser effect is created within the solar flare and can be directed using the Ringworld superconductor network to fire in any direction. The laser is powered by the energy in the solar flare, so the possible energy output is unbelievable.
When the Pak built the Ringworld, they built the Meteor Defence to work automatically. It fires on any object whose projected path crosses the surface of the Ringworld and might potentially cause damage. This automatic function is discovered when Louis Wu and his team orbit the sun and are fired on. The laser blasts off the instruments on the wing of their ship and causes the stasis field on board to activate to protect the lives of the occupants.

Temple of Confucius, Qufu

The Temple of Confucius () in Qufu, Shandong Province of China, is the "original", largest and most famous of the temples of Confucius in China and East Asia. 
Since 1994, the Temple of Confucius has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu". The two other parts of the site are the nearby Kong Family Mansion (), where Confucius descendants lived, and the Cemetery of Confucius () a couple kilometers to the north, where Confucius and many of his descendant are buried. The three sites are collectively known in Qufu as "San Kong" (三孔), i.e. "The Three Confucian ".
History.
Within two years after the death of Confucius, his former house in Qufu was already consecrated as a temple by the Prince of Lu. In 205 BC, Emperor Gao of the Han Dynasty was the first emperor to offer sacrifices to the memory of Confucius in Qufu. He set an example for many emperors and high officials to follow. Later, emperors would visit Qufu after their enthronement or on important occasions such as a successful war. In total, 12 different emperors paid 20 personal visits to Qufu to worship Confucius. About 100 others sent their deputies for 196 official visits. The original three-room house of Confucius was removed from the temple complex during a rebuilding undertaken in 611 AD. In 1012 and in 1094, during the Song Dynasty, the temple was extended into a design with three sections and four courtyards, around which eventually more than 400 rooms were arranged. Fire and vandalism destroyed the temple in 1214, during the Jin Dynasty. It was restored to its former extent by the year 1302 during the Yuan Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 1331, the temple was framed in an enclosure wall modelled on the Imperial palace. 
After another devastation by fire in 1499, the temple was finally restored to its present scale. In 1724, yet another fire largely destroyed the main hall and the sculptures it contained. The subsequent restoration was completed in 1730. Many of the replacement sculptures were damaged and destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In total, the Temple of Confucius has undergone 15 major renovations, 31 large repairs, and numerous small building measures.
Description.
The temple complex is among the largest in China, it covers an area of 16,000 square metres and has a total of 460 rooms. Because the last major redesign following the fire in 1499 took place shortly after the building of the Forbidden City in the Ming Dynasty, the architecture of the Temple of Confucius resembles that of the Forbidden City in many ways. 
The main part of the temple consists of 9 courtyards arranged on a central axis, which is oriented in the north-south direction and is 1.3 km in length. The first three courtyards have small gates and are planted with tall pine trees, they serve an introductory function. The first (southernmost) gate is named "Lingxing Gate" (棂星门) after a star in the Great Bear constellation, the name suggests that Confucius is a star from heaven. The buildings in the remaining courtyards form the heart of the complex. They are impressive structures with yellow roof-tiles (otherwise reserved for the emperor) and red-painted walls, they are surrounded by dark-green pine trees to create a color contrast with complementary colors. 
The main structures of the temple are:
Dacheng Hall.
The Dacheng Hall (), whose name is usually translated as the Hall of Great Perfection or the Hall of Great Achievement, is the architectural center of the present-day complex. The hall covers an area of 54 by 34 m and stands slightly less than 32 m tall. It is supported by 28 richly decorated pillars, each 6 m high and 0.8 m in diameter and carved in one piece out of local rock. The 10 columns on the front side of the hall are decorated with coiled dragons. It is said that these columns were covered during visits by the emperor in order not to arouse his envy. Dacheng Hall served as the principal place for offering sacrifices to the memory of Confucius. 
Apricot Platform.
In the center of the courtyard in front of Dacheng Hall stands the Xing Tan Pavilion (), or the Apricot Platform. It commemorates Confucius teaching his students under an apricot tree. Each year at Qufu and at many other Confucian temples a ceremony is held on September 28 to commemorate Confucius' birthday.
Stele pavilions.
A large number of stone stelae are located on the premises of the Temple of Confucius. A recent book on Confucian stelae in Qufu catalogs around 500 such monuments on the temple's grounds, noting that the list is far from complete. The steles commemorate repeated rebuildings and renovations of the temple complex, contain texts extolling Confucius and imperial edicts granting him new honorary titles. While most of these tablets were originally associated with the Temple of Confucius, some have been moved to the temple's grounds for safekeeping from other sites in Qufu in modern times.
The inscriptions on the stelae are mostly in Chinese, but some of the Yuan Dynasty and Qing Dynasty stelae also have texts, respectively, in Middle Mongolian (using the 'Pags-Pa script) and Manchu.
Some of the most important imperial stelae are concentrated in the area known as the "Thirteen Stele Pavilions" (十三碑亭, "Sanshi Bei Ting"). These 13 pavilions are arranged in two rows in the narrow courtyard between the Pavilion of the Star of Literature ("Kuiwen Ge") in the south and the Gates of Great Perfection ("Dacheng Men") in the north. 
The northern row consists of five pavilions, each of which houses one large stele carried by a giant stone tortoise ("bixi") and crowned with dragons; they were installed during the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong eras of the Qing Dynasty (between Kangxi 22 and Qianlong 13, i.e. A.D. 1683-1748. These imperial stelae stand 3.8 to 4 m tall, their turtles being up to 4.8 m long. They weigh up to 65 tons (including the stele, the "bixi" turtle, and the plinth under it). 
The southern row consists of eight pavilions, housing smaller steles, several in each. Four of them house stelae from the Jurchen Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) and the Mongol Yuan Dynasty; the others, from the Qing Dynasty.
A large number of smaller tablets of various eras, without "bixi" pedestals, are lined in the open air in "annexes" around the four corners of the Thirteen Stele Pavilions area.
Four important tortoise-borne imperial stelae from the Ming Dynasty can be found in the courtyard south of the Star of Literature Pavilion. This area has two stele pavilions. The eastern pavilion houses a stele from Year 4 of the Hongwu era (1371), designating deities associated with geographical directions etc. The western pavilion contains a stele from Year 15 of the Yongle era (1417), commemorating a renovation of the temple. The other two stelae are in the open air: a Year 4 of the Chenghua era (1468) stele
in front of the eastern pavilion, and Year 17 of the Hongzhi era (1504) stele in front of the western pavilion, also commemorating temple repair projects. Dozens more of smaller, turtle-less stelae are located in this area as well.

Re Shoe Lace Ltd

Re Shoe Lace Ltd 1 BCLC 111 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning voidable transactions.
Facts.
The liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd sought a declaration that a debenture given to Sharp Investments Ltd, which owned 80 per cent of Shoe Lace and was part of a group controlled by the alleged shadow director Mr Mahtani who lived in Ratingen, was invalid under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 245 because it was created after payments to the company. Shoe Lace had shoe shops in Lancashire and Yorkshire but was hopelessly insolvent by April 1990. It gave a debenture to Sharp Investments Ltd secured with a floating charge over the whole undertaking on 24 July. Sharp gave it £300,000 on 3 April, £50,000 in May and £11,500 in July. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 245(2)(a) states that a floating charge is voidable if the value given for the charge does not come after or ‘at the same time’ as the charge created. It was questioned what the precise time limit of this was.
Judgment.
Hoffmann J held that the debenture was voidable, because no businessman would hold this to have been at the same time.
Ralph Gibson LJ, Nolan LJ and Sir Christopher Slade upheld Hoffmann J that a delay of any substantial length (more than a coffee break) would be fatal to the exception.

Hollenfels Castle

Hollenfels Castle (), with a history dating back to the 11th century, is one of the castles located close to the River Eisch in the so-called Valley of the Seven Castles in central Luxembourg. Today it is used as a centre for activities for young people, including a nearby youth hostel.
Location.
Located at the southern end of the village of Hollenfels, the castle stands high above the River Eisch. A path with steep steps and wooden bridges leads to the foot of the castle where hollows in the rock can be seen, explaining the origin of the castle's name which literally means "hollow cliff". Indeed, there are several tunnels running through the cliffs below the castle. Access to the castle is by means of a brick bridge over the defensive ditch. 
History.
The first mention of Hollenfels was in 1129 when Ludolf, Lord of Hollenfels, was given the water rights of the abbey of Marienthal which lies just 400 metres away. The majestic tower, 39 metres tall, with its sumptious Gothic rooms reached by means of a spiral staircase was built in 1380. At the lowest level is the oven room, next comes the servants dining room, then the Gothic Room for the lords of the castle together with a chapel, sometimes used as a bedroom, and finally the armory at the top. The rooms have impressive fireplaces, windows set back in the sturdy walls and a number of sculptures. 
Until 1477, the castle belonged to the lords of Hollenfeld and Elter. It then successively became the property of Raville of Ansembourg, Greiffenklau, Raugraves of Salm, von Thinner, von Hohenstein and Brouckhoven-Hohenstein. In the 1680s, the castle was captured by the French, taken back by the Spaniards and finally recaptured by the French. The mansion on the north-eastern side of the keep was added in 1729 and was restyled with a Baroque finish in 1921. In 1929, when the castle was falling into ruin, restoration work was carried out by the Luxembourg architect J. Schoenberg. Between 1945 and 1948, the castle was used as a camp for prisoners of war. In 1948, the Luxembourg State acquired the building and created a youth hostel there.
The castle today.
Today the castle houses State facilities directed towards improving the education of young people. Open throughout the year, the services allow young people to experience the historic building while coming in close contact with nature. The conditions are enhanced by the nearby youth hostel.

Gregory T. Bedell

Gregory Thurston Bedell (August 27, 1817 – March 11, 1892) was the third Episcopal Bishop of Ohio.
Early life.
Bedell was born in Hudson, New York in 1817, the son of Gregory Townsend Bedell and his wife, Penelope Thurston Bedell. While an infant, Bedell's family moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1822, they moved again, to Philadelphia where his father became the rector of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church. Bedell attended Bristol College, graduating in 1836, and the Virginia Theological Seminary, graduating in 1840. 
Bedell was ordained deacon that same year by his great-uncle, Bishop Richard Channing Moore, and was ordained priest by the same bishop in 1841. After his ordination to the priesthood, he served as rector of Church of the Holy Trinity in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Two years later, Bedell moved to Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he remained until his elevation to the episcopate. While there, Bedell earned a doctorate of divinity from Norwich University. In 1845, Bedell married Julia Strong. They had three children, all of whom died in infancy.

When Bishop McIlvaine died in 1873, Bedell succeeded him as the third Bishop of Ohio. In 1875, the diocese was divided into northern and southern parts, and Bedell remained bishop of the northern part, which retained the name "Ohio". Theologically, Bedell leaned toward the evangelical side of the Episcopal Church, in contrast to the growing Tractarian movement.

Christine Young

Christine Young is an award-winning American investigative journalist and author of the book "A Bitter Brew: Faith, Power and Poison in a Small New England Town," which documented the largest case of criminal arsenic poisoning in American history.
Biography.
Early years and education.
In 2009 Young received a Knight-Bagehot Fellowship in Economics and Business Journalism from Columbia University, from which she received a Master of Science degree. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Southern Maine.
Career.
Young began her career at WMTW, the ABC affiliate in Portland, Maine, where her reporting, profiled on A&E's "Cold Case Files" and TruTV's Forensic Files, led police to the remains of Pearl Bruns, a South Portland grandmother who was found buried in the basement of her home after she was beaten to death by her husband. 
In 1996 Young led the first television camera crew into the world's largest brown egg production facility, Decoster Eggs, where she documented dangerous and inhumane conditions for migrant workers. Later, Young's reporting exposed financial skullduggery and illegal election practices of the Christian Civic League of Maine, a conservative lobbying group responsible for overturning Maine's gay rights law.
Young's 2005 book, "A Bitter Brew: Faith, Power and Poison in a Small New England Town," documented a 2003 arsenic poisoning that took place at a small Lutheran church in New Sweden, Maine, killing one church member and making 15 others critically ill. While Maine State Police and many church members theorized that someone had helped the poisoner, lifelong church member Daniel Bondeson, Young's book rejected the conspiracy theory, revealing that Bondeson, who shot himself at his family farm five days after the poisoning, left a note taking sole responsibility for the crime. In 2006, the Maine Attorney General agreed that Bondeson had acted alone and closed the case. 
In 2006, Young began investigating the facts behind the 1987 Hell's Kitchen murder of a young prostitute from Buffalo, New York, Michaelanne Hall, and the conviction of an intellectually challenged security guard, Lebrew Jones. Suspecting Jones had been wrongfully convicted, Young convinced the New York County District Attorney's Office to reopen the case, and Jones was freed from prison in 2009. 
In December, 2009, Young's series of multimedia stories on the Jones case was highlighted in testimony before the Federal Trade Commission by Karen Dunlap, president of the journalism think tank Poytner Institute. Jones, the son of Count Basie and Duke Ellington jazz drummer Rufus "Speedy" Jones, served 22 years in prison before winning an early release that legal experts attributed to Young's work.
As of the spring of 2013, Young was working on a book about the Lebrew Jones case.
Awards and honors.
Young is the recipient of the New York Newspaper Publishers Association's Distinguished Investigative Reporting Award, the New York Associated Press Writing Contest, the New York Associated Press Award for Beat Reporting, the Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award for Investigative Reporting, the 2008 Online News Association's Online Journalism Award, and the 2009 Excellence in Criminal Justice Reporting Award from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She has also received the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award Silver Baton, the National Headliner Award for Investigative Reporting, the Clarion Award for Investigative Reporting, and an Edward R. Murrow Award.

<doc id="31171426" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31171426" title="Itsagoal">
Itsagoal

Itsagoal (also known as IAG) is a browser based, online football management game which is free to play. The game was developed in the UK by ITSAGOAL.com LTD, and first released in 2001. It is based around the financial management of a football club, as well as tactics, player coaching and team management. The game is currently listed on one site amongst the top 20 online football manager games around. The site is also listed in the Yahoo! Directory amongst other established fantasy soccer games online.
The game is free to play and whilst there is an option to subscribe, subscribers get no significant gameplay advantage over users with free accounts. The general aim of the game is to manage a football club by choosing your team's tactics and line-up, organising training, setting ticket prices, dealing in the transfer market, negotiating contracts with current players and organising your backroom staff. There is also the option to set up a youth academy containing up to eight players between the ages of 12 - 18, who on turning 16 can be offered a first team place, or be given more time to progress at youth level.
History.
The original Itsagoal was created in 2001, introducing the green interface and menu system which would continue right up until the current version. The original game contained a large number of leagues and clubs, and the general consensus was that the gameplay was too easy and the game structure too disorganised. This resulted in the game being taken off the site by the developers.
The site as it is today, was launched on the 27th of October 2006.
Gameplay.
Games are played at 3am UK time, when the game updates are also processed. League games take place on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, with cup matches being played on Wednesdays and Saturdays where applicable. There is also the option to play a reserve match on Wednesdays at 5pm, and on days during the off season. There is a second update at 5 p.m. each day, which can be useful for checking other aspects of management, such as transfer news.
League Structure.
As of season 24, Itsagoal consists of 12 leagues, each containing 10 divisions. Each division contains 20 teams, with 3 teams moving up and 3 teams moving down divisions every season.
Competitions.
As well as a league schedule, Itsagoal has two other main knock out cup competitions. The first is the League Cup, which is a cup competition played out between teams of the same league. The second is the main cup competition on Itsagoal - the IAG Super Cup. The super cup involves every team in every league in the game, and anyone can be drawn against anyone else.
Transfers.
The transfer system used by Itsagoal is currently based on a bidding system, and are commonly referred to as bidding 'wars' between managers. A seller places a player on the transfer market for a set number of days. Transfers close at some point on the last day of the listing, at a time unknown to the bidding and selling managers.
Youth Academy.
Itsagoal gives managers the option to set up a youth academy, containing a maximum of 8 youth players. In order to run a youth academy, managers need to hire a scout to find youth players, and a youth coach to train them (see below). Players can manually be offered promotion to the first team by the manager once the player reaches 16 and has been in the academy for 21 days. However, the manager can also choose to keep the player in the academy until he reaches 18, upon which date he will automatically be offered promotion to the first team.
Youth players don't always accept promotion to the first team, but it is generally considered that the longer they spend in the academy, the more chance they have of signing a provisional professional contract with the first team.
Staff.
Managers are able to assemble a team of back room staff and coaches, each having their own area of the club to work on, depending on which role the manager recruits them for. The five staff roles available are as follows:
Community.
The game contains a set of integrated forums, as well as blogs and stories sections, which managers use to discuss a range of issues from the game itself, to general non-football topics. However, the forums don't allow managers to discuss game issues in detail which might give other managers an advantage. This non-sharing of critical game information is unique for a game of this type.
Subscription.
Subscribers get access to additional features, which aren't supposed to give any advantage over free account users. These include things such as the ability to play friendly matches, customise your club badge, save tactics and organise training schedules.

Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki

The Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki (Greek : "Α.Τ.Ε.Ι. Θεσσαλονίκης"), is a higher education public institute, part of the Greek tertiary education system, specialized on applied sciences. The institute has three campuses. The main campus is located 15 km outside the city of Thessaloniki in Sindos, the second campus is in the nearby city of Kilkis and the last campus is in Nea Moudania.
History.
At the year 2000 the institute and the technology education in the city of Thessaloniki became 30 years old, having existed before with the name ("K.A.T.E." and "K.A.T.E.E"). With the enactment of higher technological education, founded the Institute in Thessaloniki, composed of five faculties: Faculty of Management and Economics - ("Σ.Δ.Ο."), School of Health and Welfare - ("Σ.Ε.Υ.Π."), Faculty of Agricultural Technology - ("Σ.ΤΕ.Γ."), School of Technological Applications - ("Σ.Τ.ΕΦ.") and Faculty of Food Technology and Nutrition - ("Σ.ΤΕ.Τ.Δ").
Facilities.
The five faculties altogether consist of 22 departments. The Department of Clothing Design and Production was added in the academic year 1999-2000 as an annex of the institute in Kilkis and in the academic year 2000-2001 the Department of Fisheries Technology - Aquaculture started operating, also as an annex of the A.T.E.I.TH., based in New Moudania Halkidiki. In addition, since the spring of 1998, two optional program studies have become available for admitting students outside the traditional way of examinations. In regards to the members of its community as a whole employed 430 permanent teachers, 220 administrators and finally the students of the institute have reached the number of 22,000.
The institute's own facilities located at the 15th km of national road Thessaloniki - Athens, near the entrance of Sindos. Spread over an area of 1,600 acres, most of which approximately 900 acres, occupied the farm, with greenhouse crops, stables, poultry farm, plant personnel, training rooms and office service farm. The total building area reaches 35,000 m², which hosts the five schools currently operating in the institute. In the same area is, finally, one of the two homes available to the institute for the accommodation of students.
In regard to laboratory equipment, the improvement is impressive, thanks to the use of national and EU funds, to which they played a key role in the establishment of the Research Committee, together with the intense activity that developed in European projects from the professors themselves. This potential, renewed and strengthened in recent years by members with upgraded academic qualifications, significantly promoted the development of cooperation with tertiary institutions, both Greek and abroad.
Departments and faculties.
The university includes 5 schools, consisting of 22 departments:
Academic Evaluation.
An external evaluation of all academic departments in Greek universities will be conducted by the Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQAA) in the following years, as well as their internal evaluation which they have to redact by themselves.

Athletics at the 2005 West Asian Games

At the 2005 West Asian Games, the athletics events were held at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Qatar. Contested over three days, from 7 to 9 December, it was the first time that women were allowed to compete in athletics events at the Games. A total of 28 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 5 by female athletes. The event was seen as a test event for the Athletics at the 2006 Asian Games, which Doha hosted the following year.
The competition featured some high level performances by a handful of elite athletes: former World Youth champions Belal Mansoor Ali and Yahya Al-Ghahes won the 1500 metres and 100 metres, respectively, while world silver medallist Mubarak Hassan Shami claimed the half marathon title. On the women's side, 2004 Olympian Ruqaya Al-Ghasra won the women's 100 m. In spite of this, many events featured only a small number of athletes and the overall standard of competition was relatively low.
Host nation Qatar topped the medal table with eleven gold medals, ten silver medals and six bronze medal. Their tally was greatly buoyed by the performances of former Kenya distance runners, including event winners Gamal Belal Salem, Majed Saeed Sultan and Musa Amer Obaid. Kuwait had the second highest number of golds with five, while Iran had the second greatest overall haul (13 medals; four golds). Of the nations competing at the games, only Lebanon and Yemen did not win medals in the athletics.
It was later revealed that 3000 metres steeplechase bronze medalist Mohammed Khassaf of Iraq and 200 metres and women's relay gold medallist Munira Saleh failed drugs test at the event and were banned.

Secrets of the Lamp

Secrets of the Lamp is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, published in 1993.
Contents.
In "Secrets of the Lamp", Zakhara's multitudes of djinn, jann, dao, efreeti, and the rest are for player characters to command. Its centerpiece is a detailed description of the famous genie City of Brass. This city, which floats on an endless lake of burning oil, is featured in a poster map and on story cards and monster sheets.
A lengthy scenario in the 32-page adventure booklet sends the PCs (levels 4-7) all over the City of Brass. An efreeti physician falls instantly in love with one of the heroes. The physician imprisons the party, and soon they run into trouble with his two current wives, his albino nightmare, patrolling salamanders, and the Sultan of the Efreet.
The 64-page "Genie Lore" book describes the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve, the Court of Ice and Steel, the Great Padishah of the Marid, genie sorcerers, new magic, and the details of genie wishes.
Publication history.
"Secrets of the Lamp" was written by Wolfgang Baur, and published by TSR in 1993.
Reception.
Allen Varney reviewed "Secrets of the Lamp" for "Dragon" magazine #219 (July 1995). He called the sourcebox itself "entertaining" and the poster map of the City of Brass "nice". He noted that with the efreet in the adventure scenario falling in love with one of the heroes, that "this kind of thing happens all the time in the Al-Qadim line". He comments further on the adventure: "It's all rambunctious excitement and daring exploits, enhanced by fanatic efreet warriors, sparktail scorpions, and the bumbling djinni Hazim the Fool. However, the DM should take care to keep things on track, because if the PCs fail, they end up slaves for seven years." Of the "Genie Lore" book, Varney comments that "Baur hints at many colorful story possibilities", and states that "We don’t get much more than imaginative hints, but in these quantities that might be all you need. Instead of developing one situation, try blitzing the players with a bunch of them. It worked fine for the Arabian Nights storytellers, and the modern role-playing gamemaster works very much in their tradition."

Slobodan Novak

Slobodan Novak (born November 3, 1924) is a Croatian prose writer, novelist.
Biography.
Novak was born in Split on November 3, 1924, the son of father Duje and mother Marija (née Smoje). He was baptized in the local church as Ante Slobodan Novak. He finished elementary school in Rab, attended gymnasium in Split, then graduated in Sušak. During World War II he joined the Yugoslav Partisans, and he later described those days ironically in his autobiographical essays "Digresije" and "Protimbe" (2003). He then attended the University of Zagreb and earned a degree in Croatian language and Yugoslav literature in 1953. He worked as lector and concealer and playwright in Croatian National Theatre in Split. Later he worked as a journalist and editor in publishing houses. In 1983 he became a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. On July 27, 1999 Slobodan Novak was declared Honorary Citizen of Rab.
Literary work.
He started his career with songs full of painful memories from the war. Verses were gathered in his work "Glasnice u oluji" () (1950). Soon he started to write fiction: he published "Krugovima" () and "Republici" (). He gained the attention of critics and public by publishing his autobiographical novel "Izgubljeni zavičaj" () (1955) where he deals with his childhood on a lonely island. The novel flows in sign of nostalgic evocation, images full of emotions, lyric and arcadian atmosphere, while the narrative rhythm closely follows the cyclical changes of the seasons. The narrator appears in two characters: in infantile “I” where he observes, registers and absorbs everything around him; and the second character as today’s “I” where he, with a sentimental and quiet dose of resignation recreates his memories and images from youth. This dualism, by which he achieves intimate dissection, is one of the main points in Novak's works.
The greatest aesthetic achievement was his novel "Mirisi, zlato i tamjan" () published in 1968. This is a story about retired middle-aged intellectual who lives with his wife on an isolated island; he lives his life and nurtures the very old Madona Markantunova, a former rich patrician woman and owner of half of the island. The story takes place in the 1960s.
Novak follows the same thematic and poetic line in his short novel "Izvanbrodski dnevnik" () published in 1977. The work was realized as a narrative triptych: it consists of three separate novelistic units which are connected with narrator, characters, situations and motives. Novak described three travels on relation island-mainland-island. But again the reason for the trip is calculation of collective myths and their own illusions.
Later, Novak published a collection of interviews with Jelena Hekman in a book named "Digresije" () in 2001. He later published "Protimbe" () (2003) which he considered as an expansion of "Digresije". "Protimbe" is one of the greatest works of Croatian autobiographical prose, rich with reminiscences and associations on youth, political and social life in SFR Yugoslavia, on the writer's experience of Croatian War of Independence and political and social changes. In the novel, he also portrays his friends and enemies, from Vlado Gotovac to Antun Šoljan, from Sven Lasta to Vladimir Bakarić. Also, the novel consists of the writer's thoughts and evaluation of the position of Croatianhood, grammar, aesthetics, ICTY, war crimes, Serbian political project, Communism and Croatian national fate.
In general, the quality, expressiveness and uniformity of Novak's works place them towards the top of Croatian modern prose and also equal to the world's literary achievements of existentialist orientation.

Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2)

Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2) BCC 636 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning a fraudulent transaction under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 423.
Facts.
Arbuthnot sought a declaration that Havelet Leasing Ltd, whose plane and coach hire business had gone insolvent, had defrauded its creditors by transferring its business, assets and contracts to the related Havelet Leasing Finance Ltd. Arbuthnot had financed part of Havelet's business, and it owned some of the vehicles which were leased to Havelet. When Havelet fell into arrears, Arbuthnot obtained a judgment and appointed a receiver. They then found that Havelet had transferred its business, assets and benefits of all Havelet’s agreements to a third company (Havelet Leasing Finance Ltd). Havelet’s lessees were paying Havelet Leasing Finance, which in turn paid Havelet in quarterly arrears. This was contended to be a fraudulent scheme to elevate the owner of Havelet in priority after insolvency.
Judgment.
Scott J held that the transfer would be reversed, that all assets in Havelet Leasing Finance’s possession were held on trust for Havelet, without prejudice to Havelet Leasing Finance’s creditors. He said that although the motive was not necessarily dishonest (on the basis that Havelet's lawyers had advised Havelet that it was not), the purpose of the transfer was to put the assets out of Arbuthnot’s reach, it was still done with the purpose of putting assets beyond creditors' reach and thus was a fraudulent transaction and void.
Scott J's judgment set out as follows.

Monarch (band)

Monarch, in the US often written Monarch!, is a French-American drone doom band.
History.
The band was founded in 2002 in Bayonne, France. In 2005, they released their debut, a double CD with three tracks. Since then the band have released new albums almost annually; additionally, they have also released various EPs, singles and splits with Moss, the Grey Daturas and Elysiüm. Monarch have released with various labels, mainly with the Spanish Throne Records and have recently signed with US label At A Loss Recordings that will release their new record, Omens. Monarch have toured frequently outside France; in the beginning of 2010 they played alongside Wolves in the Throne Room in Australia, and 2010/2011 Monarch toured North America, Japan and Australia.
Music.
The band states doom metal and sludge metal bands like Black Sabbath, Noothgrush, Corrupted, Burning Witch and The Melvins as main influences, but emphasizes with the note ""but mainly Black Sabbath"" the special importance of the classic metal band. Their 2010 album stresses this through its title, "Sabbat Noir", French for "Black Sabbath". Eduardo Rivadavia from Allmusic sees their sound as similar to drone metal like Khanate and Rigor Sardonicous, but often harsher. British magazine "Rock-A-Rolla" considers the band to be rooted in modern doom metal. Monarch have also shown appreciation and claim to be influenced by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone, and several D-beat bands such as Discharge, Disclose and Aghast; and covered songs by Turbonegro and Discharge, among others.
Concept.
Since their founding the band's concept did not change drastically; guitarist Kaïdine described as follows: "The main idea was to play slow and loud as fuck. We were all playing in fast bands so we wanted to play something very different, something new and challenging for us." Monarch tracks are quite long, roundabout 20 minutes, and to date the longest is the song "Amplifire Death March", which is 58:27 minutes long and was released in 2006 as part of a split. The track length causes the band to release albums almost annually.
Songwriting.
Their songwriting is not systematic, leaving room for random events and improvisation. The interaction with the amplifiers is very important; bassist MicHell states: "The raw material we work with emanates directly from our amps. […] In that sense there’s actually a physical dimension in our songwriting: seeing how the amps will respond differently according to how we position ourselves in front of them to achieve, for example, a more droning effect, or harsher feedback… So we can’t really write a song unless we’re in front of stacks of loud amps.”
The instrumentation is quite minimalistic. Guitarists and bassist are working with amplifiers by Sovtek, Acoustic, Orange, Hiwatt, Sunn and Marshall plus fuzzboxes. The singer uses delay- and reverb-pedals.
Reception.
After the reissue of "Mer Morte", "Lords Of Metal" called the band a "deep black minimalistic, slow, humongous doom monster". "Maelstrom" called Monarch 2007 in a review of "Dead Men Tell No Tales" "soon-to-be doom titans", emphasizing the album to be a challenge for every doom metal fan, though "it's worth it, as Monarch! have some fantastic music".
Reviewing the same album, "Heathen Harvest" states that it by no means bad, but calls Monarch a copycat of pioneering bands like Boris, Pelican, Isis and Khanate. German "metal.de" called the 2007 album "Speak Of The Sea" "meaningless drone tracks, which basic idea almost too obviously and thus bold was stolen from Khanate".
"Vampster" was impressed 2010 by the album "Sabbat Noir" and Monarch's "undeviating path to dissolve any music into noise" and states that "neither Switchblade nor Black Shape of Nexus, Corrupted, Black Boned Angel, Nadja or Moss deliver more vehement antimusic than Monarch". Beside the band's extremism the reviewer is recognizing something new too: "This is what sludge is going to be, when one keeps moving along way outside drone doom, to try something different. […] The fact is neither drone nor doom can be more extreme without turning to pure noise. Monarch pay tribute to Black Sabbath also by making earth shaking music and in trying something new with a lot of courage and a portion of madness not to underrate […]".
Village Voice called a New York concert in November 2010 "a focused, intense performance, utterly lacking the catharsis that's metal's usual stock-in-trade".

Tomo no Yoshio

, or , was a counsellor of the state in Japan.
Arson.
On the tenth day of the third month of 866, Tomo no Yoshio set fire to the Ōtenmon gate with the intent of placing blame on the minister of the left, the sadajin Minamoto no Makoto. Arson has always been a serious crime in Japan, and the punishment throughout most of history has typically been execution. Yoshio was able to convince the minister on the right, udajin Fujiwara no Yoshimi, that Makoto was behind the arson. As a result Yoshimi attempted to get the counsellor Fujiwara no Mototsune to arrest Makoto. However, instead of making the arrest, Mototsune informed his father, the Daijō Daijin, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, of the situation. Yoshifusa was unconvinced that Makoto could do such a heinous crime and called for the emperor in an attempt to vouch for Makoto’s innocence and straighten out the matter at hand. As a result, Makoto was left unpunished and a consolation was sent to him. It wasn’t until the eight month of that year, that the burning of Ōtenmon gate was attributed to Tomo no Yoshio and his allies due to a report made by Ōyake no Takatori. A thorough investigation was carried out and on the twenty-second day of the ninth month, Tomo no Yoshio was exiled to Izu Province. This story appears to have been passed down through story telling for many generations, becoming widely known. The historical account can be found in "Sandai Jitsuroku".
Cultural references.
“The story of a cook who saw the ghost of counsellor Tomo” is the eleventh story of the twenty-seventh volume of "Konjaku Monogatarishū". In the story, Ban no Yoshio appears in front of a cook after a late night of work and describes himself as a god of pestilence and disease. He goes on to relay his life’s story, admitting that he committed a serious crime. Although the crime is not detailed there, it clearly refers to the burning of Ōtenmon gate and his exile to Izu as punishment. The story portrays Ban no Yoshio’s knowledge of the seriousness of his act and the justice of his punishment. He pronounces his debt, owed to the country for being so well treated during his service at court, and goes on to describe his hand in turning an epidemic that would kill all into a mere cough; which suggests some form of reciprocity.

Friedrich Feuerbach

Friedrich Heinrich Feuerbach (1806–1880) was a German philologist and philosopher. In the 1840s he played an important role disseminating materialist and atheist philosophy.
Life.
Friedrich Feuerbach was born on September 29, 1806, in Munich. He was the youngest son of the distinguished jurist Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach (1775–1833) and uncle of painter Anselm Feuerbach (1829–1880). His older brothers were all distinguished scholars.
Cf. "Meyers Konversations-Lexikon." 4th edition, vol. 6, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig, 1885–1892. 
</ref> In 1826 he began his studies at the university of Erlangen. At first he studied theology, then history and finally philology and philosophy, specializing in Sanskrit literature. His supervisor was Friedrich Rückert. At Erlangen he was a member of a liberal nationalist student fraternity. In 1831, shortly after graduating, he went to Paris to work with the noted philologists and linguists Chézy, Bournouf and Remusat. France had recently experienced the July Revolution, and Friedrich met with some of the French utopian socialists of the time (e.g., Pierre Leroux). He also seems to have travelled to Switzerland, where he met the radical followers of Wilhelm Weitling; some of them subsequently studied his writings on religion. There is no evidence, however, that Friedrich Feuerbach himself ever participated in any revolutionary association (nor would this have been in character with his diffident nature).
On his return to Germany Feuerbach did not seek a profession but instead took rented rooms in Nuremberg and lived on a small state pension. He lived that way for most of his life. Friedrich Feuerbach published several translations from Sanskrit, Spanish, Italin and French. In the 1830s he was associated with the Young German movement in literature; in the early 1840s he contributed to a number of Young Hegelian magazines. Friedrich Freuerbach is described as extremely shy and withdrawn. His brother Ludwig described him as utterly undemanding. The suicide attempt of his older brother Karl, the mathematician, who had been arrested for belonging to a liberal student fraternity in 1824, seems to have greatly affected Friedrich. He was with Karl during his battle with mental illness and when he died prematurely in 1834. The physician Dr. Theodor Spoerri, a family friend, thought he suffered from "heaviness of the blood" (depression). He also thought that the "genius" of the talented Feuerbach family was most concentrated in Friedrich, the least-known brother. The philosopher Georg Friedrich Daumer was one of his few occasional visitors. The liberal theologian Johann Heinrich Wichern also acknowledged his influence.
Friedrich Feuerbach was a qualified Orientalist with several publications. However, under the influence of his brother Ludwig, he turned to philosophy. He expounded a critique of religion that was heavily indebted to his brother's. He professed "to preach what he taught." Friedrich often actively assisted Ludwig in editing his manuscripts. In spite of his atheism, Friedrich seems to have sympathized with a local liberal Protestant 'free faith' group. He died in Nuremberg on January 24, 1880.
Views.
Friedrich Feuerbach shared his brother Ludwig's materialistic humanism. However, he focused less on his brother's theories of the origin of religious alienation and more on the practical implications of religion. Religion requires of the believer "a perpetual sacrifice of his autonomous thinking." The desire for happiness is the most powerful human drive, but it can be fulfilled only if (a) human beings know their essential nature ("Wesen") and (b) they love it. Christianity interferes with the first by replacing science with superstition; it hinders the second by portraying human beings as hopelessly weak and dependent on the will of an almighty God. It is the task of the State, through education and enlightened laws, to provide the material conditions of happiness. To do this, the State must emancipate itself from the influence of the Church. Although Church and State seem symbiotic, the priesthood merely a spiritual police force to complement the secular, in essence Church and State are in conflict: The essence and instrument of the State is the law, but the Church demands of believers obedience to the absolute will of God. As law is in conflict with arbitrary will, so the role of citizen is in conflict with that of believer. So the State must become secular, although Feuerbach acknowledges it will be difficult to remove religion from the minds of the people. The means to social reform is through education. Friedrich Feuebach's political ideal may be described as a kind of utopian socialism: a benevolent secular State that provides people with a scientific education, organises conditions of life rationally and encourages mutual love and assistance.
Although Friedrich Feurbach humbly thought of himself as a mere disseminator of his brother Ludwig's ideas, there were differences between them. Ludwig's distinctive analysis of the concept of God as alienated 'species being' played little role in Friedrich's writings; Friedrich focused on the nefarious implications of God as absolute arbitrary willpower. The note of social radicalism of the professed 'communist' Ludwig was largely absent from Friedrich, who never clarified whether the secular state he envisioned presiding over a society based on mutual aid, could be established by the existing government by enlightened reform from above, or required a more radical change of system. Another difference concerns the role Friedrich Feuerbach assigns to the secular State in establishing conditions of universal happiness and enlightenment about religion; Ludwig Feuerbach places much less emphasis on the state and seems rather more hostile to it.
Quotes.
"No salvation outside of humanity! These words contain the whole of the religion of the future."
"Not irreligion, not unbelief in the dogmas of the religious communities into which people happen to be born, no! "lack of love" and "ignorance" are the two main sources of all earthly calamities."
"Love of humanity … belongs undeniably to the consitions of human welfare; but if it consists in mutual assistance in the striving for happiness and wellbeing, and if this happiness and wellbeing consist above all – as is likewise undeniable – in the satisfaction of our inborn natural drives and the development of our natural powers … the most fertile soil for love of humanity will evidently not be the belief that human nature is thoroughly degenerate and worthless, but rather in the view according to which we regard it [viz., human nature as the essentially and generally acceptable foundation and condition of all our being, feeling, thinking and striving…"

Marguerite Pearson

Marguerite Pearson (Tesseine) (September 6, 1932 – January 4, 2005) was a utility player who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League between the and seasons. Listed at , 125 lb., Pearson batted and thew right-handed. She was nicknamed ″Dolly".
The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League flourished in the 1940s when Major League Baseball went on hold as men went to World War II. The league was created in 1943 by the Chicago Cubs' owner Philip K. Wrigley, and disbanded at the end of the 1954 season. In its twelve years of history, the AAGPBL gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained.
During her seven-year tenure in the AAGPBL, Dolly Pearson moved around for a while, playing for seven different clubs in seven different cities as the league shifted players as needed to help weak teams stay afloat. A versatile utility, she played all positions except catcher before becoming a regular shortstop. Pearson never had the opportunity to play for a pennant contender or a champion team.
After her baseball career was over, Pearson made a name for herself promoting youth sports activities to provide a safe and family-oriented environment on the field, which gained her induction in several Halls of Fame.
Born in Pittsburgh (Hazelwood), Pennsylvania, Pearson was the daughter of William and Retha (Hayes) Pearson. She graduated from Allderdice High School in Hazelwood. She was playing sandlot baseball with the boys and was gaining a reputation. And a AAGPBL scout caught wind, and signed Pearson at the age of 14 nearing 15, the youngest player ever to play in the league. 
Pearson entered the league in 1948 with the Muskegon Lassies, playing for them for one year before joining the Peoria Redwings (1949), Racine Belles (1950), Battle Creek Belles (1951), Kalamazoo Lassies (1951–1952), South Bend Blue Sox (1953) and Grand Rapids Chicks (1954).
On the last day of her rookie season, Pearson celebrated her 16th birthday to everybody's surprise, because everyone thought she was already 16 (the minimum age according the rules), so she had played "illegally" all year. In addition to Dolly, she also received one of the more unusual nicknames in the AAGPBL – "Buttons". Pearson received her curious nickname on a trip with the club, when she wanted to play with all the push-buttons in the train. Overall, Pearson appeared in 82 games and hit .182 with 15 runs and 12 RBI.
In 1949, Pearson batted .216 with Peoria, playing only in 30 games at various positions. At Racine the next year, she started at center field and posted a .235 average with 41 runs and 47 RBI in a career-high 110 games. Then in 1951 she found herself on the move again, this time to Battle Creek, where she started at shortstop, the position she would play for the rest of her career. In addition, she was sent to Kalamazoo in the midseason, combining for a .190 average in 100 games for both teams.
Pearson hit .185 in 44 games for Kalamazoo in 1952 and moved to South Bend in 1953. She appeared in 90 games for the Blue Sox, batting .185 with 29 RBI and 38 runs scored, being selected for the All-Star Team in 1953. Then she joined Grand Rapids in 1954, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL's final season. The league reduced the size of the ball 10 inches to major league size that year. As a result, Pearson started hitting the ball with authority and posted a .326 average with 18 home runs and a slugging of .544, driving in 47 runs while scoring 41 times, setting career-marks. In 85 games, she committed 29 errors in 350 chances for a .917 fielding average.
Once the league folded, Pearson started playing slow-pitch softball in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where her club won 18 championships. She married Edward Tesseine in 1955. The couple raised four children: Retha, Sam, Ron and Ed, and had five grandchildren; Taylon, Kaedria (Sam), Stacy, Rodney and Russell (Retha). 
She worked in the Central Michigan University athletics department for several years, while helping her husband run the bar they owned at Mount Pleasant, E.J.'s Lounge, until 1981.
Widowed in 1991, Pearson retired in 1994 and was involved in the Foster Grandparents Program. Children were always an integral part of her life, as she started the first T-ball program in Mt. Pleasant. She also trained and coached boys' baseball and girls' softball at various levels in the Michigan area, and coached senior girls' bowling for many years.
She was the Grand Rapids, Michigan City Woman's singles' bowling Champion in 1968.
Honors and awards.
Since 1988 she is part of "Women in Baseball", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She also gained inductions into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame, the Michigan Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame, the Michigan State Softball Hall of Fame, and the Mount Pleasant Bowlers Hall of Fame.
Dolly Pearson died at her home in Mount Pleasant, Michigan at the age of 72.

Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd

Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/2.html UKHL 2 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning voidable transactions.
In this case, the court examined whether a series of arrangements could be understood as one "transaction" for the purposes of the Insolvency Act 1986. Ultimately, the court found that, for the purposes of insolvency law, It may be appropriate to consider details of a complex series of linked transactions to assess whether the transaction was undertaken at an ‘undervalue’.
Facts.
Mr Phillips, the liquidator of AJ Bekhor & Co, sought to recover the £725,000 and interest for a business and asset that had been transferred to a subsidiary, which in turn was bought by Brewin Dolphin through a share purchase for £1. The question was whether this constituted a transaction at an undervalue contrary to the Insolvency Act 1986 section 238. Brewin Dolphin contended that part of the agreement was that its parent company, Private Capital Group Ltd, would pay AJ Bekhor four yearly instalments of £312,000 for renting computer equipment. The covenant for the rental had been sublet to BD by AJB despite an absolute bar in the head lease.
The trial judge and the Court of Appeal refused to take the computer rental agreement into account, as part of consideration for the share transaction.
Judgment.
The House of Lords held that the transaction was effected at an undervalue, was voidable under section 238. The computer rental agreement was taken as consideration for the deal, but when assessing its value, reality and not speculative values should not be taken into account. The collateral agreement was precarious, and worthless because the headlessors had immediately declared the transaction to be a repudiatory breach, and it therefore had no value to Brewin Dolphin.

Re Gray's Inn Construction Co Ltd

Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd 1 WLR 711 is a leading UK insolvency law case, concerning the cessation of transactions without court approval after a winding up petition.
Facts.
Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd was a building business, which did a number of small jobs. When one of its creditors, Field-Davis Ltd presented a petition, it was ordered to be wound up by the court. Between the petition date and the court order date, its bank, Natwest (Tavistock Square branch) allowed it to operate its account. It traded unprofitably.
Judgment.
Buckley LJ declined to validate most of the transactions and gave guidance on when they would or would not be void. He held that all transactions in and out of the bank account were ‘dispositions’ within the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 (at the time, CA 1948 s 227). The court should validate transactions to ensure that unsecured creditors will not be prejudiced, applications for specific transactions have to show proof there will be no prejudice, and the more speculative a transaction is, the more unlikely it should be approved. Applications to court need not be made if there is a need for speedy action and the beneficial character of the bargain is obvious. Sales of assets for full market value raise no concern.
Buckley LJ's judgment read as follows.
Goff LJ and Sir David Cairns concurred.
