Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant

The Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant was built in 1909-1910 on the Weber River of northeastern Utah, USA, about southeast of Ogden, Utah. It was built by the Utah Light and Railway Company under the direction of E.H. Harriman, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. It was one of the first powerplants in Utah designed to feed an electrical grid rather than as a source of power of a single locality.
History.
Work had begun on an intake structure in Weber Canyon in the early 1900s at the Devil's Gate location under the direction of C.K. Bannister, an engineer from Ogden. Bannister's plan for a hydroelectric station was contested by the Union Pacific, whose line ran through the canyon. Bannister died shortly after, and his business associates sold the property rights to the Utah Light and Railway Company. Work continued on a penstock to feed the power plant until Harriman acquired sixty percent of the UL&R. With Harriman's ownership Union Pacific opposition to the plant ceased, on the condition that a retaining wall be built to protect the railroad grade. The powerhouse was built in 1909-1910, along with three residences for plant operators. Harriman died in 1914 and the UL&P became the locally-owned Utah Light and Traction Company, which leased the station to the Utah Power and Light Company. The dam was rebuilt in 1916-1917 to better accommodate flood flows. Another operator's residence was built in 1922, together with some utility structures in ensuing years. The plant was upgraded from 2.5 MW to 3.5MW in 1948. Automation allowed a reduction in staff in the 1960s, and two of the residences were demolished. The remaining two were damaged by flood in 1982. A fire in 1983 resulted in renovations and alterations to the powerhouse.
Description.
Water is fed to the powerplant from a low dam about upstream. Overflow is controlled by two tainter gates between concrete piers. A wide fish ladder climbs the north side of the dam. On the south side a large sluice gate allows the small reservoir to be drained. The intake structure is between the sluice gate and the south buttress wall, housed in a small wood frame intake house.A one-story wood-frame watchman's house is just downstream from the intake house, and is joined to the intake house. The power plant intake conduit is a diameter reinforced concrete pipe for the first , transitioning to a welded steel pipe. This replaced of concrete pipe and of wood stave pipe in 1949. The conduit is buried along most of its length. It crosses the river on a -span riveted steel Howe truss bridge made by the American Bridge Company downstream from the dam. Total head is about to . Since the conduit has been altered and is partly buried under the rail line it is not included in the historic district designation.
The powerhouse is a rectangular brick building with a gabled concrete roof supported by riveted steel Fink trusses. The end walls are five bays wide with stepped parapets at the gables. Original window openings have been bricked in. Side elevations are three bays wide, also with infilled window openings. The structure sits on a concrete foundation that incorporates outflow works. The main room in the powerhouse accommodates a Pelton wheel turbine and a 2300 volt generator made by Western Electric, together with a small 125VDC exciter generator. The main generator was rewound during upgrade work in the 1940s. The turbine room is served by a 20-ton traveling crane made by the Whiting Foundry Equipment Company. Three other rooms house batteries, a workshop, and a third room formerly housed switchgear.
The operator's camp once had four houses. Two remain, a one-story brick house and a 1922 wood cottage. Both houses retain landscaping and garden areas with outdoor fireplaces. There are several outbuildings associated with the property. The Davis and Weber Canal Company maintains a diversion dam just downstream from the powerhouse that is not part of the historic district.
The powerhouse and associated structures were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 1989. It is visible from Interstate 84 in Weber Canyon, between the lanes of the highway, whose westbound lanes pass just to the north..

Nyagak II Power Station

Nyagak II Power Station is a 5 MW proposed mini hydroelectric power project in Uganda.
Location.
The power station will be located across the Nyagak River, in Rateng Village, Paidha Sub County, Okoro County, Zombo District, in West Nile, Northern Uganda. This location lies near the town of Paidha, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, approximately , downstream of the existing Nyagak Power Station.
The approximate coordinates of Nyagak II Power Station are:2° 30' 0.00"N, 30° 59' 24.00"E (Latitude:2.5000; Longitude:30.9900). The coordinates are approximate because the power station does not yet appear on most publicly available maps.
Overview.
During the construction of Nyagak Power Station (2006 - 2012), it became clear that its 3.5 MW output was inadequate to meet the electricity needs of the entire West Nile sub-region. In addition, the towns of Aruu and Mahagi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have expressed the desire to be supplied with electricity from neighboring West Nile in Uganda. 
In order to meet these needs, while awaiting the construction of the 600 MW Karuma Power Station, the Government of Uganda has gone ahead to start the construction of Nyagak II Power Station, to supplement Nyagak Power Station, as a bridge measure. The available literature suggests that the government will fund this development on its own. It appears that this power station is separate from Nyagak III Power Station, which will be developed through a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
Construction timetable.
It is anticipated that the construction process for Nyagak II Power Station will last three years, with commissioning expected in the second half of 2015.
Construction costs.
While the exact construction costs of Nyagak II Power Station have not been disclosed, similar power stations built recently in the same neighborhood, have cost between US$15 million and US$20 million. The power generated will be evacuated via the existing 33kV transmission power lines linking the towns of Paidha, Nebbi, Bondo, Okollo and Arua, constructed at an estimated cost of US$15 million, between 2006 and 2012, during the development of Nyagak Power Station. The power lines will also be extended to Pakwach, on the banks of the Albert Nile, with funding from the German Development Bank (KfW).

Blood (In This Moment album)

Blood is the fourth studio album by the American band In This Moment. The album was released by Century Media on August 14, 2012. As has been the case with every In This Moment album, the record has a different sound, dropping many of the traditional metalcore elements in favor for electronic samples and further experimentation.
Background and lineup changes.
After over a year of touring to support their release, "A Star-Crossed Wasteland", the band was ready to start work on their upcoming fourth record. Lead vocalist Maria Brink revealed that this album would be darker and the first time the band would be working with outside musicians. However, the band found themselves in a difficult position. Original members Blake Bunzel and Jeff Fabb left In This Moment to join American Idol finalist James Durbin's touring band. An official statement was released on their Facebook page in November announcing the departure. The statement also stated that the rest of the band members were ready to head back to the studio in the beginning of 2012 for a summer release. The replacements for Bunzel and Fabb, Randy Weitzel and Tom Hane, were introduced during In This Moment's appearance at Shiprocked in December and Soundwave in February, respectively.
Album & Songs.
Brink and Chris Howorth saw the band departures as something positive and it would heavily influence the album. Brink says, "it’s meant to be that they moved on and some other things in my life, it’s so cool ‘cause it’s just like this brand new everything and it feels really awesome. And you’re going to be able to hear it." Howorth says, "Jeff and Blake leaving kind of opened us up a bit and we went from the heart. We went a different route and it was more organic than ever before." Brink and Howorth reteamed with long time producer, Kevin Churko at the Hideout in Vegas to begin process on the album. Two songs emerged from those sessions, "Blood", and "Hello" (later became 'From the Ashes'), which Howorth says brought them a new management deal with In De Goot."
Blood made its first appearance during In This Moment's set on the Soundwave festival on February 26, 2012. Other new songs that made it onto their "First Blood" Tour included "Adrenalize", "Whore", "Burn", and "You're Gonna Listen". The words to the album intro, "Rise With Me" were sung by Maria over Dredg's "What Have I Done" on their 2011 tour as an intro.
On May 14, 2012 it was announced that the album will be released on August 14, 2012 and that the first single, Blood will be released on June 12, 2012. A stream of the studio version premiered in a Cage Match battle on WWBM on May 31, 2012. "You're Gonna Listen" was available for streaming on July 3, 2012.
The album artwork and track-listing for "Blood" were released on June 18, 2012.
Reissue.
A Deluxe Edition featuring a bonus disc of remixes was released on December 14, 2012. It was sold exclusively at all Hot Topic stores and was to contain the iTunes bonus track of Nine Inch Nails' Closer, however the song was left out of the initial pressing. The bonus track was available as a free download to those who purchased the release. The error was corrected in later pressings. Blood was re-released on May 31, 2013 in Europe as a 2 disc edition titled "Reissue & Bonus" featuring the same track listing as the Hot Topic release.
The album was reissued for the third time titled "Blood (Special Edition)" on January 21, 2014. It contains the bonus track Nine Inch Nails' Closer and includes a DVD titled "Blood at the Orpheum" which was shot on May 21, 2013 at the Orpheum Theater in Madison. This is the first live concert DVD shoot for the band. A cover of Nine Inch Nails' Hurt was performed at the show, however it was omitted on the release. A Bluray version of the release was made available exclusively at Best Buy retail stores and the audio of the concert was released digitally at the same time titled Blood at the Orpheum.
Sales.
Blood debuted on the "Billboard" 200 chart at #15, selling around 20,000 copies. This marks the highest position the band has charted to date. As of February 12, 2014, "Blood" has sold over 227,000 copies.

Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture" is an upcoming first-person adventure video game being developed by The Chinese Room and SCE Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. A spiritual successor to "Dear Esther", the game will be set in a large open world and will be a story driven game. Initially announced for Microsoft Windows, the game will now be released for the PlayStation 4, with no plans at present to release on PC.
Plot.
"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture" will be based around six characters, each telling their own story, and each connected to landmarks in the world that evolve as the game progresses. The game will take place in a village in Shropshire during the apocalypse.
Gameplay.
"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture" will differ from its spiritual predecessor by allowing more interaction, such as manipulating objects and opening and closing doors. While playing, the player will be able to influence the events that take place.
Development.
During the development of "Dear Esther", the team wanted to introduce interactive elements. But it became clear to the team that it simply wasn't going to work, thus the concept of Rapture was born.
Unlike "Dear Esther" before it, "Everybody's Gone to the Rapture" will not appear on PCs, instead being a PS4 exclusive. The team made the decision to partner with Sony as they felt they could not raise enough money for the project through crowd funding sources or through sales of alpha versions.

Labour for Independence

Labour for Independence is a political organisation which seeks to give a voice to pro-independence supporters of the Scottish Labour Party. It claims to have 2,000 members across Scotland.
Ideology.
Labour for Independence adheres to Labour's "founding principles [...] of fairness, equality and justice" and seeks to offer a vision of an independent Scotland for Labour supporters, in lieu of Scottish Labour doing so. An opinion poll in March 2014 suggested that almost a quarter of Labour voters were planning to vote Yes in the referendum The appeal of Labour for Independence has been attributed to frustration and disappointment felt by Labour voters in Scotland during the New Labour reign of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
The decision of the British Labour Party to abstain from the vote on the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 on 19 March 2013 also aroused anger from many mainstream Labour supporters. Polling has also suggested that up to 20% of Scottish Labour supporters are dissatisfied with the party's Holyrood leader, Johann Lamont. Labour MP Alistair Darling, who heads the pro-Union Better Together campaign, also has a dissatisfaction rate of 27%.
Organisation.
Labour for Independence is now organised in 5 regional units:
History.
Formation.
Labour for Independence was established in 2012 by Allan Grogan, a Scottish Labour member from Angus. It initially consisted of a website and a Facebook group. Grogan wrote on his website: "We need to show the Labour Party, the rest of the political parties and the media watching, that there is a genuine demand from Labour voters for independence". While the head of the Yes Scotland campaign welcomed the creation of a pro-independence group within the Labour Party, it was reported that Labour chiefs believed there was little support within party ranks for independence.
The group held its first public conference at Glasgow Caledonian University on 12 November 2012, in a meeting attended by around 100 party members, activists and supporters and was subject to mass media coverage in the printed press all over Scotland over the following days. Speakers at the event included former Labour MP, Dennis Canavan, Yes Scotland Chief Executive Blair Jenkins, Jeane Freeman from Women for Independence, Ravenscraig trade union leader Tommy Brennan, and Ricky Ross from Deacon Blue. The shift from being an e-campaign group to being an active "feet-on-the-ground" movement was widely seen as the next step forward and warmly received.
2013 policy conference.
The group hosted a two-day policy conference in July 2013, which sought to suggest possible policies for a post-independence Scottish Labour Party. The conference was open to paid members only, who must be either existing members of the Labour Party or members of no party whatsoever. It is expected to have hosted 100 people. Policies adopted at the conference include complete opposition to the Trident nuclear weapons programme.
Later activity.
Allan Grogan spoke at the March and Rally for Scottish Independence in September 2013, at which a contingent of Labour for Independence supporters reportedly waved "red flags with a thistle in the upper hoist quarter".
Controversy.
In July 2013, Labour for Independence was branded as an "SNP front" by Anas Sarwar, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, who said that SNP politicians and supporters were "masquerading" as Labour supporters and giving a false impression about the campaign, though LFI founder Allan Grogan responded by stating: "There are many instances in which non-LFI volunteers were pictured around our banner. At no time have we ever claimed these people to be volunteers of LFI."
In August 2013, the "Sunday Herald" reported that Celia Fitzgerald, an office-bearer within the group, had been an SNP activist since leaving Labour over the Iraq War. She rejoined Labour in 2012 with the aim of changing the party's stance towards the referendum. LFI leader Allan Grogan said he knew of examples of SNP members handing out LFI leaflets. He admitted only 40% of his group's 80 or so members are actually in the Labour Party. Grogan also said LFI had received initial financial support from Yes Scotland, regarding the £245 accommodation bill for the LFI's first conference.
Later in the month, the group's founder accused Better Together of running a "dirty tricks" campaign and "witch hunt" to discredit his group, the executive of which is made up entirely of card-carrying Labour members.
An editorial by the International Socialist Group likened Scottish Labour's criticism of the group to "a popular child's tantrum" while describing Labour for Independence as "novel, creative, and engaging [...] proponents of a new Scotland".

<doc id="36586999" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36586999" title="World Sensorium">
World Sensorium

World Sensorium is a natural and inclusive world scent, a work of olfactory art by interdisciplinary artist Gayil Nalls, who is based in New York. A large-scale conceptual project and social sculpture, the world scent comprises the most culturally significant scents of 225 countries combined proportionally according to the statistical population data of the year 2000. World Sensorium has been recognized by UNESCO and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities as a global peace project and has been internationally exhibited in large public events, museums and galleries since its creation in 1999. 
The research for the creation of World Sensorium established smells from natural flora that triggered olfactory memory for the majority of people of each nation, with the goal of interpreting the relationship between world flora and human numbers on earth, and to bring new awareness of the living world and its influence on the human spirit and psyche. Through this work, Nalls has sought to foster an understanding of the larger evolutionary social construct of knowledge we share with others via the senses.
The project of World Sensorium can be categorized as a contribution to the genres of Olfactory Art and Aesthetics, Participatory art, and environmental art and functions along the trajectories of avant-garde and political or activist art.
Creative Inspiration.
Berlin Wall.
Nalls envisioned this concept for a “world scent” in 1989, eleven years prior to its completion and debut release. She describes the moment of inspiration for the formula as having occurred on December 28 of that year at the Brandenberg Gate, as the crowd pulled her on top of the Berlin Wall. As the connectivity passed through the bodies gathered, she envisioned a formula for World Sensorium where everyone would be counted.
Relationship to Permutatude Theory.
World Sensorium was created for the aesthetic of mass anatomy to evoke global memory and to evolve a metabolic collective. Permutatude Theory and science form a significant background to the ongoing project, as do the processes of cultural transformation and globalization. As a theoretical construct, conceived to be an embodied consciousness of “one world” the olfactory sculpture critically engages individuals with their sense of smell, often in performative settings.
Methodology.
Determination of ingredients.
Historical scents of all the countries of the world, culturally significant in medicine, mythology, the arts, anthropology, spiritual practices, diet and memory were identified based on survey research to obtain quantitative information that supplied the raw data for the creation of the scent, establishing the constituent natural plant oils “from tree, flower, grass or herb”. 
Many of the plants were identified in local vernacular and required additional research to verify the Latin or English names. In some instances an English name did not exist. “Nalls located botanical taxonomy scholars from the New York Botanical Garden and ethno-botanists from the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii to assist in properly identifying the botanical names” materials which had been referred to in colloquial terms such as, Senegal: Gowe (Cyperus articulatus), no English name, and American Samoa: Mos’oi (Cananga odorata), English name Ylang-ylang.
“The goal was to have to have each flora’s complex molecular compositions represented in its entirety so as to be perceived by humans as closely as it would if it were experienced in its habitat, in order to evoke the same psychological ad emotional responses, and neurological and immune functions as in the traditions of the culture.” To this end all raw materials were derived straight from botanical sources by means of distillation or extraction.
Formula.
The composition of these ingredients was based on projected population percentages for each individual country for the year 2000. Everyone was counted.
Impact as World Peace Project.
Global communications.
In her quantitative research, Nalls crossed political boundaries in dialog with “countries the United States doesn’t get along with, such as Iran (rose), Iraq (date palm) Libya (orange blossom) and Cuba (tobacco).”
In some cases, communications spanned several months, but an especially “poignant moment in the creation of World Sensorium was the day the representative from the Israeli Embassy in Washington and the Palestinian representative from the united Nations called Nalls by phone within minutes of each other to report that their national choices were both the Olive tree because of its long revered association with peace.”
Recognition and Honors.
In 1998, in recognition of Nalls’ outstanding creative achievement, World Sensorium was endorsed by the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was granted sponsorship by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an original cultural initiative building goodwill and peace in conjunction with the United Nation’s International Year for Culture of Peace. In his letter to Nalls, Director-General, Dr. Federico Mayor, a brain biochemist, said that World Sensorium is a “highly original cultural initiative” that “will certainly contribute to creating a climate of goodwill and peace at this memorable moment in time” leading to “understanding and collaboration among nations”.
Cultural Significance.
Olfactory Art and Aesthetics.
With World Sensorium and more recent works, Nalls has advanced concepts of aesthetics to consider the olfactory sense over the historically privileged sense of vision. While the visual remains dominant, artists have and are now increasingly working with the sense of smell to produce emotionally and phenomenologically resonant works in the emergent genre of Olfactory Art. Nalls “like many other olfactory artists, uses only natural fragrances and essential oils. “I call it ‘rewilding the mind,’” she says.
Participatory Art.
For Nalls, the connection between olfaction and social or participatory art is rooted in the evolutionary biology of the sense of smell. As the oldest sense, olfaction has the uncanny ability to trigger memory (individual and collective), and its significant role in chemosensory communication is critical to the collective action that is necessary for participatory social and art processes. 
World Sensorium is a participatory project in its all-inclusive ethos, Nalls’ intention for its en masse experience, and in its very creation which at times required to assistance of volunteers to gather the phytogenic materials. “Randia aculeata an ingredient from the Netherlands Antilles, could only be found locally in Florida. A team was rushed to the site before Hurricane Lenny came in and swept through the area.” to harvest the leaves.
Avant-gardism and Political Art.
In its use of extant culturally significant plant materials, Nalls advances the advant-garde notion that art should be brought closer to the praxis of life. World Sensorium is all-inclusive in its conception–a reflection of actual human-plant relations, making every experience of World Sensorium a connection to the world’s collective ecology and human consciousness. When experienced en masse as in Times Square, Nalls initiated a collective metabolic experience, and introduced a universal language for cross-cultural efforts toward peace, by evoking our co-evolution with nature. Ken Johnson called World Sensorium a "utopian project" and "an olfactory metaphor for world unity" by an "earnest and rather grandiose conceptualist".
Exhibition History.
Additionally World Sensorium has been shown in group exhibitions in the United States, England, Sweden and Slovenia.

Mecklenburg XIX

The locomotives of Class XIX of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway were deployed on the Bad Doberan–Heiligendamm narrow-gauge. The triple-coupled engines were classified as T 7's in 1910. In 1911 they were transferred to te Neubukow Beet Railway.
History.
The Class XVIII locomotives were soon unable to cope with the increase in traffic. As a result a triple-coupled engine was ordered from Krauss in Munich. The locomotive was given the number 1003 by the Mecklenburg State Railway and was incorporated into Class XIX. In 1898 another locomotive, number 1004, followed. In 1910 the line was extended as far as Arendsee. To handle the higher levels of traffic, three similar engines were ordered from Henschel. With the introduction into service of these locomotives, that were grouped into Class T 7, the two Krauss locomotives were given to the Neubukow Beet Railway. The engines were still listed in the first Deutsche Reichsbahn renumbering plan in 1923, but they were retired by 1924.
Design features.
The locomotives had an inside frame which was built as a water tank. The boiler comprised two shell rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward shell ring. The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel spark arrestor. Later a Prüsmann chimney was used.
The horizontally arranged two-cylinder, wet steam drive acted on the rearmost coupled axle. The Stephenson valve gear with crossed eccentric rods was also on the outside.
The two front coupled axles had leaf spring blocks at the height of the running plate. These were linked by equalising beams. The rear axle was sprung with a transverse leaf spring stack.
The hand brake acted on the two outside wheel sets from the outside. Later the locomotives were given Knorr air brakes. The sanding gear sat on the middle of the boiler and sanded the outer sets of wheels from the outside. To begin with the running gear was covered. The locomotives also had steam heating, a steam bell and a De Limon centralized lubricating system.

Melong, Cameroon

Melong is a community in Cameroon. It lies on the N5 road to the north of Nkongsamba.
The soil is volcanic and fertile.
The country around Melong was once covered by thick rainforest, but migration of Bamileke people into the region has caused much of this to be cleared for farming.
Due to cultivation, the volcanic andosols are gradually evolving into ferralsols.
In 1936 the Bishop Paul Bouque transferred the junior seminary to Melong.
The first candidates from this seminary were accepted by the senior seminary at Mvolyé in 1940.
Albert Ndongmo was admitted to the seminary at Melong in September 1940.

105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment

The 105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment () was an aviation regiment established in 1946 as 3rd Training Aviation Regiment () as part of the Yugoslav Air Force.
History.
3rd Training Aviation Regiment.
The 3rd Training Aviation Regiment was formed on December 201, 1946 by order from August 1945 at Kovin airfield. It was formed from 2nd Squadron of 2nd Training Aviation Regiment equipped with Soviet-made Il-2, UT-2 and Yugoslav-made trainer aircraft, as part of Military Aviation College. By the 1947 the regiment had composed from two squadrons, and later number of squadrons was reduced to just one.
By the 1948 year this regiment was renamed like all other units of Yugoslav Army, so it has become 105th Assault-Training Aviation Regiment ("105. vazduhoplovni školski puk / 105. јуришни ваздухопловни школски пук").
The commander of regiment in this period was Aleksandar Radičević-Zemlja.
105th Regiment.
The 105th Assault-Training Aviation Regiment was based at Kovin airfield for short period. By year 1949 it was dislocated to Mostar airport, where it has remain also for short time, and it has moved to Nikšić, until it was disbanded. It was equipped with Soviet Il-2 attack-trainers, Yakovlev UT-2 trainers and domestic made trainers. 
Regiment was reestablished in 1951 at Titograd airport, equipped with Aero-2 training aircraft as part of Active Aviation Officers School of Military Aviation Academy and from 1953 as part of Flight training center. In year 1956 regiment was reformed in to 2nd Pilot School. The Aero-2 aircraft were replaced in late 1950's with Aero-3 and Soko 522 trainers. 
By the 1960 regiment was again renamed in to 105th Training Aviation Regiment ("105. avijacijski školski puk / 105. авијацијски школски пук") which was dislocated to Zemunik from February 2, 1961. Same year, with the application of the "Drvar" reorganization of the Air Force, a new type of designation system was used to identify the squadrons of the regiment, which have became the 463rd, 464th and the 465th Light Combat Aviation Squadrons.
New domestic made G-2 Galeb trainer jet aircraft have replaced Aero-3 and Soko 522 piston-engine trainers in 1966, and three squadrons have been reorganized in to just two - 249th and 251st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron. In 1969 Regiment has been last time renamed in to 105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment. By the 1974 Czechoslovak-made Zlin 526F aerobatic aircraft were introduced with 3rd Mixed Aviation Squadron of 105th Regiment, which has later in 1976 been renumbered as 333rd Squadron. Domestic Utva 75 basic trainesrs were introduced in 333rd Squadron by 1980 being used for flight selection of Military Aviation Academy cadets and their basic training. Later in middle 1980's 333rd Squadron has formed the aerobatic team of the Yugoslav Air Force with six IJ-21 Jastreb light attack aircraft painted in yellow with the colors of the Yugoslav Flag in blue, white and red, named Leteće zvezde (Flying stars). 
In 1986 229th Squadron has been reequipped with new G-4 Super Galeb advanced training jet aircraft which have replaced G-2 Galeb in that squadron. By 1990 seven G-4 Super Galeb aircraft replaced the IJ-21 Jastrebs with the Leteće zvezde team. They were painted in colors of Yugoslav Flag, blue, white and red.
The Regiment was active in combat operations during the 1991 and early 1992 during the war in Croatia. Due the first Croatian hostile activities against Yugoslav People's Army units, 105th Regiment has received order to retreat from Zemunik airport to Udbina airport in Serb controlled Krajina with its two combat squadrons, 249th and 251st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, while 333rd Squadron was dislocated to Golubovci Air Base. Two squadrons at Udbina have got their nicknames and badges - 249th - "Kobre" ("Cobras") and 251st - "Pume" ("Pumas"). The main tasks of 105th Regiment during the war were air support to Yugoslav People's Army ground units of 9th Corps and Naval forces. 
Due the withdrawn of Yugoslav People's Army from Croatia, regiment has been dislocated to Golubovci, Montenegro, where it has been disbanded in early April 1992. The 251st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron was reattached to 172nd Aviation Brigade. 249th Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and personal were divided by 172nd Aviation Brigade and 252nd Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron.
The commanders of regiment in this period were Aleksandar Radičević, Branko Glumac, Branislav Novaković, Svetislav Nešović, Radivoje Kaćanski, Ismet Kulenović, Teodor Majev, Momčilo Nikić, Gajo Vukčević, Miloš Bajčetić, Janez Turk, Milovan Ristić, Radomir Brković, Jovan Marić, Radovan Veselinović and Nikola Dukić.

Berlin Pride

The Berlin Pride Celebration, usually known as "CSD Berlin", is a parade and festival held at the end of June each year in Berlin to celebrate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and their allies. CSD stands for Christopher Street Day. Since 1979, the event has been held each year. Berlin Pride is one of the largest gay and lesbian organized event in Germany and one of the biggest in Europe. Its aim is to demonstrate for equal rights and equal treatment for LGBT people, as well as celebrate the pride in Gay and Lesbian Culture.
History.
The CSD is held in memory of the Stonewall Riots, the first big uprising of homosexuals against police assaults on June 27, 1969. These took place in Christopher Street, Greenwich Village (New York, USA.)
The first CSD in Berlin took place on the 30th of June 1979 and since then has taken place every year. In 2012 around 700.000 people attended the CSD Parade, and 500.000 people were present at the Finale at the Brandenburg Gate, making it into one of the largest events in Berlin as well as one of the largest Pride Events in the world.
CSD Berlin Events.
CSD Berlin comprises several events, taking place within the framework of the month-long Pride Festival, usually starting at the end of May. Pride Week is the final week of the festival, ending with the CSD Parade.
The CSD Gala has been taking place since 2011, and is organised in co-operation with the Friedrichstadt Show Palace.
In the same month both Kreuzberg Pride and "Gay Night at the Zoo" are held. More gay festivals in Berlin are Folsom Europe and Easter in Berlin.
Organization.
All CSD events are organised by the Berliner CSD e.V. (Berlin LGBT Pride Association.) Berliner CSD e.V. was formed at the end of 1999. The association was meant to relieve the three previous coordinators: the “Sonntags-Club”, “LSVD” and “Mann-o-Meter”, who had been organizing the “CSD Berlin” from 1994 to 1999.
Each year, the theme, motto and political demands of the CSD Parade are determined in so-called Pride Forums. These are open meetings that can be attended by anyone.

Klepton

Klepton (abbr. kl.) and synklepton (abbr sk.) are biological classifications.
Kleptons are species that require input from another biological taxon to complete their reproductive cycle. Specific types of kleptons are "zygokleptons", which reproduce by zygogenesis; "gynokleptons" which reproduce by gynogenesis, and "tychokleptons", which reproduce by a combination of both systems.
The term is derived from the Greek, "kleptein", "to steal".

Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology

Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology in Wickliffe, Ohio, is a Roman Catholic seminary that serves the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. It was established in 1848 by the first bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland, Louis Amadeus Rappe.
History.
Bishop Louis Amadeus Rapp established the seminary in Cleveland in 1848 as St. Francis de Sales Seminary, a name it used for only a short time before becoming Saint Mary Seminary. In its first years, the seminary was housed in a former stable, but in 1859 it was moved to a new purpose-built structure at the corner of Lake and Hamilton Streets in Cleveland. 
During the 1920s, the institution moved again, to a new building at Superior and Ansel Roads in Cleveland. In 1922, the institutional focus was changed to a college undergraduate program, meaning that seminarians from Cleveland studied theology at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati. However, the Cleveland seminary program resumed in 1929, and from 1929 to 1954, the Cleveland institution offered both undergraduate education and graduate theology training. In 1954, a separate undergraduate college program, known as Borromeo College (or Borromeo College Seminary), was started in Wickliffe on a campus formerly occupied by Marycrest School. Borromeo offered a liberal arts program and awarded bachelor's degrees to male students considering the possibility of entering the priesthood. In 1990 the St. Mary Seminary programs were moved to the Wickliffe location, while the Borromeo undergraduate program continues at John Carroll University.
Programs.
The seminary's main mission is to prepare students for Roman Catholic priesthood. It awards master's degrees in theology and divinity, as well as a Doctor of Ministry. As of 2009, about 130 students were enrolled.
Accreditation.
It has regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is an accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

No. 27 Squadron IAF

No. 27 Squadron (Flaming Arrows) IAF is a Ground-Attack and Close Air Support squadron of the Indian Air Force, operating from Gorkhapur AFS, under Central Air Command.
History.
The squadron was raised at Adampur AFS on 15 February 1957, with de Havilland Vampires, as a Ground-Attack and Close Air Support unit. The Vampires were replaced by September, the next year, with Hunter Mk.56 aircraft, when it was moved to Ambala AFS. 
It had its first taste of war during the 1961 war in Goa, tasked to participate in Operation Vijay, strafing various ground targets and airfields.
Indo-Pakistan War of 1965.
During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, the squadron operated from Halwara under the Western Air Command, carrying out Air Defence and Ground Attack missions over Punjab. 
On 7 September, at 0615 hours, five aircraft of the squadron participated in an attack on Chota Sargodha Air Base, in Pakistan. Then Flight Lt. D.N. Rathore destroyed at least two PAF F-86 Sabres parked in the airbase. The squadron flew Reconnaissance, Opportunity, and CAS missions in the Gujranwala sector, in the Sialkot-Lahore-Ferozpur axis and in the Khemkaran-Kasur Sector, destroying several enemy tanks and contributing to the "Graveyards of Pattons there". These actions were at a high cost though, the squadron lost five aircraft and two pilots. It earned 2 Vir Chakras, and 5 Mention-in-Despatches.
Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
In April 1965, at Halwara, all the Hunter Mk. 56 aircraft were replaced with Hunter Mk. 56A, and its role changed to Deep Penetration Strike and Fighter Recon. In July 1971, the squadron was relocated to Pathankot.
In December, during the 1971 War with Pakistan, the squadron carried a number of sorties over Poonch Sector, providing CAS to ground units. In addition, the squadron flew Combat Air Patrols over army concentration areas, to intercept any enemy aircraft. On 7 December, the squadron shifted its missions, providing CAS in the Chhamb-Akhnoor Sector.
Post-War Period.
At some point after the war, the squadron was re-equipped with Jaguar IS aircraft. 
The squadron won several trophies in various exercises and gunnery meets, and participated in various operations. On November 13, 1996, it was awarded President Colour for its contributions both in war and peace.

Emergency War Order

The term Emergency War Orders, often abbreviated as "EWO", refers to a shift in the standard operating procedure of the United States armed forces from a peacetime to wartime contingency. The activation of Emergency War Orders is designed to occur after a devastating or sneak attack against U.S. forces, requiring swift action for remaining military units to avoid further destruction. Emergency War Orders are normally transmitted in Emergency Action Messages.
Some provisions often included in Emergency War Orders are:
As Emergency War Orders are only designed for activation during a declared war, the last time such measures were in effect was during World War II. During the Cold War, EWO procedures existed in the event of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. 
For peace-keeping operations and non-wartime campaigns (such as Operation Enduring Freedom), EWO does not technically apply, although similar General Orders exist to deal with combat conditions and execution of military operations under fire.

Osendé Afana

Castor Osendé Afana (1930 - 15 March 1966) was a Marxist economist and militant nationalist who died in 1966 while fighting as a guerrilla against the government of Cameroon.
Early years.
Castor Osendé Afana was born in 1930 in Ngoksa near Sa'a, in the Centre Region of Cameroon.
In 1948 he was admitted to the seminary at Mvolyé, where he became a strong friend of Albert Ndongmo, the future Bishop of Nkongsamba. He left the seminary in 1950 and became a militant nationalist.
At that time Eastern Cameroon was under French colonial rule, and would not gain independence until 1960.
Afana joined the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC), a left-wing movement agitating for independence and led by Ruben Um Nyobé.
Osendé Afana went to Toulouse, France to study Economic Science, and by 1956 was a vice-president of the Black African Students Federation in France ("Fédération des étudiants d'Afrique noire en France" - FEANF), and was managing director of the FEANF organ "L'Etudiant d'Afrique noire".
As a UPC militant he ensured that the issues of Cameroon were well-covered. 
While he was managing director, the moderate viewpoint of the magazine shifted to a harder and more incisive tone.
In 1958 Osendé Afana was General Treasurer of FEANF, as well as being responsible for the UPC in France.
In 1958, after Ruben Um Nyobé died, Osendé Afana decided to abandon his thesis and rejoin the leadership of the UPC, proposing himself as a candidate for the new Secretary General. Nyobé's successor, Félix-Roland Moumié, told him "There is no longer a Secretary General. There was one, he is dead, that is it."
However, Osendé Afana was designated UPC representative at the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Cairo in December 1957 - January 1958.
The conference was dominated by supporters of the Chinese version of communism, 
and later Osendé's Maoism was to arouse suspicions with the UPC leadership in Accra.
Osendé Afana completed his studies in Paris in September 1962 and traveled to Accra.
UPC leadership in exile.
In April and May 1955 the UPC held a series of angry meetings, circulated pamphlets and organized strikes.
On 13 July 1955 the French government dissolved the UPC by decree. 
Most of the UPC leaders moved to Kumba in the British-administered Southern Cameroons to avoid being jailed by the colonial power. 
In July 1957, under pressure from the French, the British authorities in western Cameroon deported the leaders of the UPC to Khartoum, Sudan.
They moved in turn to Cairo, Egypt, to Conakry, Guinea and finally to Accra, Ghana.
After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, UPC rebels who had been fighting the French colonial government continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French.
On 6 September 1962 the UPC leadership in exile met in Accra at Ndeh Ntumazah's house, and decided to exclude the "criminal clique of Woungly" from the administrative secretariat.
At ten that evening, when the attendees were about to leave, a bomb exploded without causing any injury.
The Ghana authorities were not amused and threw the entire UPC leadership in jail.
In October they freed Massaga, Tchaptchet and Ntumazah, but kept Abel Kingué in prison.
On 13 September 1962 the UPC organized its first "Assemblée populaire sous maquis" in Mungo, where the Revolutionary Committee was named.
The committee was presided over by Ernest Ouandié. 
Other members were Abel Kingué, Michel Ndoh, Ndongo Diyé, Osendé Afana, Nicanor Njiawe and Woungly-Massaga.
A two-headed leadership was theoretically in place, with Abel Kingué leading the exiles from Ghana and Ernest Ouandié in the maquis. 
The organization functioned poorly due to communication problems and also to the Sino-Soviet split.
The next year it split, with Abel Kingué and Osendé Afana allied with Ntumazah and opposed to the other leaders.
Guerilla.
In 1963 Osendé Afana left Cairo, Egypt, where he had taken refuge. He traveled to Conakry, Guinea, and then to Accra, Ghana, where he met the core of the leadership in exile. He spent the following months in Brazzaville before secretly entering Cameroon with the intent of establishing a new maquis, a second front in the Moloundou region, a corner of Cameroon that borders the Republic of the Congo.
In August 1963 there had been a popular revolution in Congo Brazzaville in which the neo-colonial regime of Fulbert Youlou was replaced by a government led by Alphonse Massemba-Débat.
This government was relatively friendly to the UPC rebels, opening the possibility of supply from the Congo.
Details of his activity in the period that followed are sketchy, but Osendé Afana seems to have made several visits to the extremely poor Moloundou region, 
where he made contact with the local people, mostly Bakas.
On 1 September 1965 a small party led by Asana entered Moloundou, mainly aiming to educate the people rather than start an uprising, but was forced to leave quickly.
He intended to establish a politico-administrative organization on Maoist lines, but the population of this very backward part of Cameroon was not receptive to these ideas.
A few months later Osendé Afana's small group returned to Moloundou.
By 5 March 1966 they had been detected and encircled by troops that were far more at home in the forest than they were. 
Osendé, a myopic intellectual, lost his spectacles and his sandals.
On 15 March 1966 his party was ambushed by a Cameroon army unit.
He did not take flight, as did most of his companions. Taken prisoner, he was killed and decapitated, and his head was flown by helicopter to Yaoundé so that President Ahmadou Ahidjo could look into the eyes of the dead man.
Publications and views.
Osendé Afana's article "Justice pour le Cameroun" (Justice for Cameroon) appeared in the first issue of "L'Etudiant d'Afrique noire" (The Black African Student) in 1956.
It included a short but complete overview of the French and British occupation and exploitation of Cameroon, including the annexation of various parts of the territory to Nigeria.
In issue 8, January 1857, he published an important article "Pour ou contre L'Etudian d'Afrique Noire?"
In February 1957 Afana gave his study "Le Kamerun en lutte" to the fourth United Nations commission, and in July 1957 published "L'Etat sous tutelle de Cameroun" (The Trust State of Cameroon).
Osendé Afana was the author of a thesis on economics that was published in the year of his death.
In the 1950s and 1960s there was rivalry between the Chinese and Soviet communist parties.
Osendé Afana aligned himself with the Chinese, who seemed more revolutionary in their views than the Soviets.
He theorized on the existence of a "primitive communism" in the pre-colonial era, but noted the existence of contradictions in the social and inter-tribal structures, and the relations between the sexes and the generations. 
In a brochure published after his death, Osendé Afana gave the standard Marxist viewpoint: "The proletariat is the most revolutionary class... Some say that in Africa it is the peasantry that is the most exploited... but anyway, it is the proletariat that is most conscious of their exploitation."

János Radványi (born 1922) is a Hungarian-born American diplomat, politician, political scientist and academic professor, who served as Hungarian Ambassador to the United States between 1962 and 1967, when he applied for asylum from the U.S. government.
Biography.
He was born in Budapest in 1922. He fought the Germans in the partisan underground until the Second World War ended. He entered diplomatic service in 1947 and was posted in Turkey, France, Switzerland, and Syria. He was appointed to head the Hungarian Embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1962. Five years later for political reasons, Ambassador Radványi cut his ties with the Hungarian government and issued a statement that said in part: ""I have always tried to work for peace and better understanding in this troubled world. However, in recent months I came to realize that it was impossible for me to act in good conscience and continue to be the representative of the Hungarian Government to the American Government.""
After being granted political asylum, he and his family moved to California. He earned a doctorate in History at Stanford University in 1971. Shortly thereafter, he joined the faculty of the History Department at Mississippi State University. In 1982, he founded and directed the Center for International Security and Strategic Studies. In June 1996, Radványi became the first chair holder of the newly established Endowed Chair for International Security and Strategic Studies at Mississippi State University.
In 1978, Radványi and his family were granted American citizenship.

Independent Collectors

Independent Collectors is an online community for contemporary art collectors. Founder Christian Schwarm originally launched the site in June 2008. Independent Collectors is said to be the largest online resource of privately owned art and also offers forums to discuss the artwork and arrange meetings. Independent Collectors is based in Berlin, Germany. Die Zeit has described the site as a "Facebook for aesthetics".
History.
Schwarm originally came up with the idea based upon his own experiences of collecting contemporary artwork, noting that he was able to get to know gallery owners but not fellow collectors. He then teamed up with Ulrich Grothe and Uwe Thomas to found the website in 2008 to allow for easier communication between collectors. 
In 2009 the site entered into a partnership with automobile manufacturer BMW, as well as entering into a content-based partnership with AXA Art.
BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors.
In 2012 Independent Collectors and BMW created the project "BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors", a guidebook featuring 173 private but publicly accessible collections of contemporary art from around the world. Next to the addresses of the private collections are short essays concerning all aspects of collecting art. The guidebook was presented during Art Basel. In September 2013 the second extended version of the Art Guide was published by Hatje Cantz. 49 new private art collections were added to the collections initially featured in the first version of the Art Guide. BMW and Independent Collectors also launched the BMW Art Guide Blog early 2013 to accompany the latest edition. The blog features among others behind the scenes posts about the publication.
Website.
The website offers the ability to manage an entire art collection online as well as the ability to present exhibitions. One of the members, Wilhelm Schürmann, used the exhibition function to curate an exhibition titled 'Das Gespinnt', which was shown at Abteiberg Museum in Mönchengladbach. The site has a search function that can focus on location, artist or members name, although users can select to keep their identity anonymous. The changes in the site came after relaunch in December 2011. In 2013 Independent Collectors has nearly 5,000 registered members and over 20,000 works of art are uploaded by the members. Each application is individually verified. Members are required to adhere to the ethical code of Independent Collectors stating that they will not promote their own business. The site has three options for membership, a free basic membership and a paid membership that marks you as a supporting or patron collector.

Weapons Master

Is a fictional character, a supervillian, who appears in various DC Comics publications. created by artist Mike Sekowsky and writer Gardner Fox. He first appeared in Brave and the Bold #29.
Pre-Crisis.
Xotar was one of the first villains ever faced by the Justice League of America. He was a highly intelligent supervillain from the year 11,960. After obtaining the diary of Snapper Carr, he learned that he successfully destroyed the Justice League after travelling to the past using one of his four most powerful weapons. The diary was damaged however so he had to fight the Justice League in small groups until he could determine which weapon defeated them. His first battle was against the Flash at a missile base. Xotar used a shrink ray which he called a microscopitor. Flash used his size to sneak inside the giant robot body Xotar used, destroyed the microscopitor and returned to normal size. Xotar then attacked the Panama Canal and battled Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter. Xotar used his de-evoluionizer and appeared to destroy the Martian Manhunter, though he actually turned invisible and destroyed the de-evolutionizer as Aquaman distracted him. He then battled Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern at Mount Rushmore. Xotar used his Magneto-Bubble weapon, which traps people in magnetic bubbles that are pulled towards the sun. Green Lantern managed to break the bubbles with his power ring, and Wonder Woman snatched the machine with her lasso. He then battled all of the Justice Leaguers with his Illusion-Maker weapon that would trick them into destroying each other. Superman's special vision allowed him to see past it and destroy the fourth weapon. Xotar was then taken back to the future and turned over to the law enforcement. As it turned out the diary Xotar read actually told of his defeat, but was so damaged it looked like it said he won the fight.
Later Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are visiting a carnival when stumble upon a plot by Xotar, who's race plans are to conquer the Earth, however they set up their cosmic carnival in order to stop the Justice League. Taking the three heroes prisoner, and using their advanced technology to make two of their members look like Green Lantern and Flash, the aliens hope to trap the rest of the Justice League. However, while trying to trick Aquaman in the same trap, the captured League members manage to break free, and although their physical forms are distorted by a cosmic fun-house mirror, they manage to stop the impostors and their plot to take over the Earth.
Post-Crisis.
When Guy Gardner, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle decide to restart the Justice League they first meeting is attacked by the Weapons Master. With a veritable arsenal of futuristic weaponry at his command, he quickly takes down all combatants and even Superman and Maxima intervention was useless. With the League defeated, the Weapons Master claims his price – Guy Gardner's power ring. As he turns to leave, he finds a new hero ready to face him – Bloodwynd. Bloodwynd channels the spirits of the dead to fight the Weapons Master. Unable to counter Bloodwynd's magic, the Weapons Master abducts the five fallen heroes and disappears. But the league eventually defeats him.

Peter Tiboris

Peter Ernest Tiboris is an American conductor particularly noted for conducting and producing concerts at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and other classical music venues around the world, especially in Greece. He has conducted over 50 concerts in Carnegie Hall and at Lincoln Center and produced nearly 1200 concerts worldwide through the company he founded in 1983, MidAmerica Productions. Mr. Tiboris' concerts have been hailed by The New York Times as "sizzling and precise," and "vigorous...alert and energetic."
Early Life/Education.
Peter Tiboris was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, on October 31, 1947, to Ernest Peter Tiboris, a dentist, from Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Stella Menas, of Waukegan, Illinois, first generation Greek-Americans of the Greek Orthodox faith.
Peter Tiboris’ interests in Greek culture and music began at age five with piano lessons and continued at age nine with organ lessons given by the Reverend Father Peter Murtos of the St. Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church in Sheboygan. At age 10 he became St. Spyridon’s organist.
Peter Tiboris studied music education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, receiving a bachelor’s degree (B.M.) in 1970 and a master’s degree (M.S.) in 1974. While still an undergraduate, he became Assistant Choir Master at the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church of Madison, under Michael Petrovich.
In 1980, he received a doctorate (Ed.D) in music education from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Between 1972 and 1984, he taught at colleges in Wisconsin, Illinois, New Hampshire, and Louisiana.
MidAmerica Productions.
While serving as Associate Professor of Music at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette (now called University of Louisiana at Lafayette) in 1983, Peter Tiboris was asked to organize a concert in New York to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Archbishop Iakovos as Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America. The concert, on January 7, 1984, at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, brought together soloists, choruses from Louisiana and New York, and the American Symphony Orchestra for a Greek-themed program which included the world premiere of Dinos Constantinides’ Hymn to the Human Spirit and the New York premiere of Constantinides’ Lament of Antigone. The concert also marked the New York conducting debut of Peter Tiboris and the inaugural concert of MidAmerica Productions.
A review of Peter Tiboris’ first concert, written by the critic Tim Page in The New York Times, deemed Mr. Tiboris’ New York conducting debut “vigorous…alert, energetic.”
Peter Tiboris has conducted many works in the choral repertoire as well as symphonic works, operas, and ballets, including world, U.S., and New York premieres of works by Beethoven/Mahler, Bruckner, Dinos Constantinides, Dello Joio, Dohnányi, Effinger, Philip Glass, Gregory Magarshak, Mozart, Nielsen, Schnittke, Taneyev, Tchaikovsky, and Mikis Theodorakis.; as well as rarely performed works by Cherubini and Rossini. He has also conducted in 20 countries.
MidAmerica Productions has presented approximately 1150 concerts worldwide, including 850 concerts in New York, in such venues as Stern Auditorium, and Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall; and Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center. The original choral format has expanded to include Madrigal Festivals, a National Wind Ensemble, Vocal Jazz Festivals, National Festival Youth Orchestra, Sweet Adelines, and solo concerts featuring such musicians as Alan Gilbert and Stanley Drucker. Since 1988, English composer and conductor John Rutter has made over 100 appearances with MidAmerica, including at the world premiere of his Mass of the Children in February 2003.
The company has become a launching pad for Elysium Recordings, Inc., a CD label founded in 1995 that has released 27 recordings to date and is distributed by Qualiton Imports which includes significant works by Mascagni and performances by Lukas Foss; the Manhattan Philharmonic, a freelance orchestra in New York; a solo and chamber music series at Weill Recital Hall and Alice Tully Hall; and a music festival in Greece, Festival of the Aegean, which has completed its 8th season on the Island of Syros and was named “Best Festival in Greater Greece 2011” by the Music Critics of the Union of Greek Music and Theater Critics, Athens, Greece.
Personal life.
Peter Tiboris is married to the soprano Eilana Lappalainen and has two children from a previous marriage, Ernest Peter Tiboris, born in 1979; and Stephanie Susan Tiboris, born in 1982. His brother, Gus, a dentist, was born in 1948 in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

The Baltic Sea watchtower () in Börgerende is an old watchtower that belonged to the Coastal Brigade ("Grenzbrigade Küste") of the East German Border Troops. As a maritime border observation tower (of type BT 11) it belonged to a series of originally 27 towers of this type on the Baltic Sea coast of East Germany, of which two have survived. The other remaining tower is in Kühlungsborn.
The tower is located right next to the beach. The East German border soldiers had the mission of observing shipping movements on the Baltic Sea and identifying escape attempts. By means of a fixed telescope with high magnification the four man crew could observe a wide area of up to 12 nautical miles distance from the observation platform.
The tower is recorded in the List of heritage monuments in Börgerende. The tower is accessible using a ladder on the inside. It is currently being restored.

<doc id="36587714" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36587714" title="Highclere (horse)">
Highclere (horse)

Highclere (1971–1992) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse owned by Queen Elizabeth II. In a racing career lasting from summer 1973 until October 1974 she ran eight times and won three races. Highclere won one minor race as a two-year-old but improved to win the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse and Prix de Diane at Chantilly. She later finished second to Dahlia in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. She retired at the end of the season to become a highly successful and influential broodmare.
Background.
Highclere was a bay filly, bred in England by her owner, Queen Elizabeth II. She was sired by the Sussex Stakes winner Queen's Hussar, whose reputation as a stallion had previously rested almost entirely on the fact that he was the sire of Brigadier Gerard. Her dam Highlight won two minor races and was a daughter of Hypericum, who won the 1000 Guineas for King George VI in 1946. As a descendant of the broodmare Feola, Highclere came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 2-f which produced Round Table, Pebbles and Aureole.
The filly was named after Highclere Castle, the home of the Queen's racing manager, Lord Carnarnvon. Highclere was sent into training with Dick Hern at his stables in West Ilsley in Berkshire. Her regular jockey was Joe Mercer.
Racing career.
1973: two-year-old season.
Highclere ran three times as a two-year-old in 1973. After finishing second in a maiden race at Newmarket, she was moved up in class for the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot Racecourse, and finished second again. On her final start, she won the Donnington Stakes at Newbury, but was not particularly impressive. At the end of the season she was allotted a weight of 109 pounds in the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to have raced in Britain. The rating placed her twenty-two pounds below the top-rated Apalachee, and nine pounds below Bitty Girl, Gentle Thoughts and Melchbourne who tied for the position of best filly.
1974: three-year-old season.
On Highclere's first appearance of 1974 she contested the Classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Wearing blinkers for the first time she started at odds of 12/1 in a field of fifteen fillies. The closing stages of the race saw a struggle between Highclere and the Peter Walwyn-trained favourite Polygamy. with the Queen's filly prevailing by a short head. The win gave the British monarch her second fillies' Classic win, seventeen years after Carrozza won the Epsom Oaks. It was believed that the course and distance of the Oaks would not suit Highclere, and so the filly was rerouted to the French equivalent, the Prix de Diane over 2100m at Chantilly. With her owner in attendance, Highclere won by two lengths from Comtesse de Loir. On their return from France Dick Hern and Joe Mercer were invited to dine with the Royal Family at Windsor Castle.
In July, Highclere raced against colts and older horses in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot. Highclere finished second, beaten two lengths by the French four-year-old filly Dahlia, who was winning the race for the second year. Highclere failed to reproduce her best form in her two remaining races. She finished unplaced behind Dahlia in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and was also unplaced in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe a race in which Allez France beat Comtesse de Loir by a head. Highclere was then retired to stud.
Retirement.
Highclere produced several winners, the best of whom were the colt Milford and the filly Height of Fashion, both of whom won the Princess of Wales's Stakes. Height of Fashion went on to produce the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby winner Nashwan as well as the multiple Group winners Nayef and Unfuwain. Another of Highclere's daughters, Burghclere produced Wind In Her Hair, the dam of Deep Impact. Highclere died in 1992.
Assessment and honours.
Highclere was given a rating of 129 by Timeform.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Highclere an "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and the forty-sixth best filly or mare trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.
Pedigree.
Highclere was inbred 3x4 to Hyperion, meaning that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. She was also inbred 4x4 to Fair Trial.

St Paul's Church, Bury

St Paul's Church, Bury, is located in Church Street, Bury, Greater Manchester, England. A former Anglican parish church, it is now redundant and, following fire damage, has been converted into residential use. The former church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.
History.
The church was built in 1838–42, and designed by John Harper of York. The land for the church was given by the 13th Earl of Derby. In 1898 the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley carried out work on the church, including removing the galleries, repairing the roof, and installing new choir stalls and a font. On 1 November 1995 the church was declared redundant. It was damaged by fire in 2004, and has since been converted for residential use.
Architecture.
St Paul's is constructed in sandstone in 13th-century Gothic Revival style. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel and a west tower. The windows along the sides of the church, and in the tower, are lancets. In the "Buildings of England" series, the authors describe the pinnacles on the tower as "like apologetic eyebrows".
External features.
The churchyard contains the war graves of thirteen soldiers of World War I and an airman of World War II. In 2006 a commemorative memorial erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was temporarily stored away from the church until the conversion of the building into apartments was completed.

<doc id="36587733" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36587733" title="Museum of the Peaceful Arts">
Museum of the Peaceful Arts

The original charter shows the scope of the museum system:
Dr. George Frederick Kunz proposed the organization of an entirely new museum, the “Museum of the Peaceful Arts” or the "Museums of the Peaceful Arts." As there are museums dedicated to science, war and industry, this would be one devoted to the study and exhibition of the peaceful arts. “…Mr. Julius Rosenwald’s industrial museum gift paralleled the $2,500,000.00 bequest of the late Henry R. Towne, lock and hardware man, to New York for a Museum of Peaceful Arts. Mr. Towne had been interested in such a museum by Dr. George F. Kunz, mineralogist and gem expert, an honorary fellow of the American Museum of Natural History, who has visited every world’s fair since the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. Announcement of the Towne bequest sent experts in agriculture, animal industry, mining and metallurgy, transportation, engineering, aeronautics, etc., etc., flocking to Europe to study exhibits in such places as the German Museum in Munich, which contains replicas or originals of epochal contrivances, including James Watt’s first steam engine, Diesel’s oil-compression engine, Dunlop’s original tires. The findings of these experts will assist Chicago’s industrialists as well as New York’s, in assembling a record of material ascendancy of mankind, a record that is to be made practical rather than theoretical, with many working models of machinery, to afford inventors an industrial laboratory.”
The museum proved to be successful. The New Yorker had a discussion about it in 1929: "They have unusual machines: Under a microscope you can see how much you can bend a steel rail with the pressure of your finger, a movie shows air currents moving, etc. The collection was started in 1913 by a group of business men. For the last two years it has been in the present museum which is supported, largely, by a bequest of two and a half million dollars from the late Henry F. Towne."
Fay Cluff Brown (1881-1968) was a physicist and inventor who created and supervised the development of educational exhibits, most notably in the Museum of Science and Industry at New York City’s Museums of the Peaceful Arts. Much of his scientific research focused on the element selenium. Early in his career, Brown invented a device using selenium, which translated printed text into sound.
Among the items owned by the Museum of the Peaceful Arts was America's first submarine: "Dr. Peter J. Gibbons and his son, Austin Flint Gibbons, who recently bought the old United States submarine boat Holland from junk dealers, yesterday presented the relic in perpetuity to the Association for the Establishment and Maintenance for the People of the City of New York of a Museum of the Peaceful Arts." Dr. George F. Kunz, the expert on gems, President of Tiffany & Co., is President of the new Association.
Several notable inventors of the time were interested in the new museum. Orville Wright wrote to Dr. Kunz in May, 1925, about giving one of the original Wright airplanes to the museum, and his experiences with other museums:
 In a book on the history of science, George Sarton says: “This museum is quoted here only pro memoria. The idea was originated by George F. Kunz (1856-1932): The projected Museum of the Peaceful Arts (paper read before the American Association of Museums’s Meeting, New York, 1912, 12 pages). Great efforts were made to obtain sufficient capital but failed. It was more or less replaced by the New York Museum of Science and Industry. G. Sarton has in his archives a considerable correspondence on this subject.”

The boat's first patrol was preceded by a pair of short trips between Kiel in Germany, and Kristiansand and Bergen in Norway. Her first sortie proper started with her departure from Bergen on 7 March 1945. It finished in the same port on 16 March. While sailing on another non-classifiable voyage, she shot a Mosquito of No. 235 Squadron RAF down. The pilot was captured.
2nd patrol and surrender.
She left Bergen on 3 April 1945 and arrived at Portland, UK, flying the black flag of surrender on 10 May.
She was then briefly used by the British as the research ship "N 86" before being transferred to Loch Ryan in Scotland for Operation "Deadlight. She was sunk on 13 December 1945.
In May 2013 her official visitors' book, and Captain Kock's fixed-focus Zeiss binoculars, taken as spoils of war by the British officer who commanded her prize crew, were shown on the BBC television series Antiques Roadshow by the officer's son, himself a former submarine captain, who used the binoculars during his career.
Armament.
FLAK weaponry.
"U-249" was mounted with a single 3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U gun on the rare LM 43U mount. The LM 43U mount was the final design of mount used on U-boats and is only known to be installed on U-boats (, , , and ). The 3.7 cm Flak M42U was the marine version of the 3.7 cm Flak used by the "Kriegsmarine" on Type VII and Type IX U-boats.

History.
Brian Baker.
As biography Counter-World Experience quotes the following words by Brian Barker on their home page:
"Jazz Metal par excellence - no holds barred!!! Since their founding in 2001, Counter-World Experience have been raising the bar in the progressive music world. The band brings Meshuggah-style grooves together with Pat Metheny-like textures, mixes them with electronic sound fragments to create a sound that is, above all, defined by guitar work in the best traditions of Dream Theater.
The musicians Benjamin Schwenen (guitars, guitar-synth), Sebastian Hoffmann (bass) and Thorsten Harnitz (drums) presented their calling card with their debut album "Always Home", and quickly began garnering recognition in the progressive scene for their sound and creative expressionism. With the following two albums "Fraktal" (2005) and "Leaving Lotus" (2007), the international press began to take notice and CWE became regarded as one of the driving points in the Jazz-Metal movement:
"Leaving Lotus is a brilliant album that is highly recommended for dedicatees of Progressive Metal" (Ragazzi)
"an absolute must-buy for fans of hardcore Progressive music...heart and soul dripping from the music" (Babyblaue Seiten)
After many concerts at such prestigious locations as the Burg Herzburg Festival, the Frankfurt Music Fair, the Freakshow Artrock Festival, or as support for Matthias IA Eklundh, Counter-World Experience had the backing of a solid and ever-expanding fan-base.
Now in early 2009, Counter-World Experience are back with their fourth studio album "Metronomicon". With this release, the band demonstrates once again how challenging Progressive Metal can be, and sets a new standard for the genre."
Progarchive.
Atavachron at Progarchive presents the band with the following words:
The fusion of jazz-rock with heavy metal is not an easy nor readily accepted form of music, and requires players of unusual vision and abilities. Berlin trio COUNTER-WORLD EXPERIENCE have been creating such a music since their inception in Hannover, 2002. The group is composed of three of Germany's most accomplished young musicians, guitarist/synthist Benjamin Schwenen, Thorsten Harnitz on drums, and world-class bassist H.D. Lorenz. The sound is quite unique though they occasionally remind of a less grandiose PLANET X, with hints of KING CRIMSON, JOE SATRIANI and even NEBELNEST.
2002 saw their debut "Always Home", primarily a modern fusion outing. 'Fraktal', their second release in the summer of 2004, introduced electronic sounds and heavier guitar layers, bringing in strong elements of metal and high-tech synthesis. In 2006 they recorded their third, 'Leaving Lotus', described by Schwenen as "Cybernetic metal combining with smooth, Pat Metheny-like texturing."
Full of complexity, innovation and surprises, COUNTER-WORLD EXPERIENCE is a band that extends the power trio concept into the future and progresses the state of both metal and fusion.
Music for Kings (2011–2012).
On their fifth studio album ´Music for Kings´, the band demonstrates better than ever their talent at combining powerful Staccato-Riffs and extravagant solo musings with electronic sound textures and listener-friendly melodies. 2012 sees Counter-World Experience creating more material utilizing the band members´ shared roots in classical music. Both guitarist Benjamin Schwenen and drummer Thorsten Harnitz have classical studies on their resumes. This formative element is immediately apparent with the band´s first work for solo organ (´Overture - The Coronation´), and also - another first for the band - in a guest appearance by opera singers in the piece ´Trois filles du roi´. Making sure the band doesn´t lose its ties to the jazz world is bassist Sebastian Hoffmann, who through his playing ranks as one of the finest musicians in the German Jazz scene. His improvisatory solos, combined with his fluid basslines, act much as a counterweight to the classic through-composed music of the band.

Church of Prophet Elijah (Thessaloniki)

The Church of Prophet Elijah () is a 14th-century church in Thessaloniki, Greece, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The church is located in the upper quarter of the old city, and dates to the Palaiologan period, but its original dedication is unknown. In Ottoman times, it was known as the Saraylı Mosque, and through a misinterpretation of this name came about its modern dedication to the Prophet Elijah. It has been traditionally identified as the "katholikon" of the Nea Moni monastery, built ca. 1360–1370 on the site of a former palace destroyed in 1342 by the Zealot uprising. Modern research however has cast doubt on this, since the Nea Moni continued to operate well into the Ottoman period, while the church of Prophet Elijah was converted into a mosque by Badrah Mustafa Pasha immediately after the city's capture in 1430. On the basis of its internal decoration, it has been suggested that the church was the "katholikon" of the important Akapniou Monastery.
Its architectural style, a variant of cross-in-square church known as the "Athonite type", is unique in the city, and was always reserved for "katholika" of monasteries. The careful masonry, of alternating courses of bricks and white ashlar, is also unusual for Thessaloniki and its region; it is copied from Constantinopolitan architecture. Fragments of the church's original decoration survive in the form of wall paintings, fine examples of late Palaiologan art, which influenced later paintings in Serbia.

Alfred Diamant

Alfred Diamant (b. Vienna, Austria, Sept. 25, 1917 – d. Bloomington, May 11, 2012) was an American political scientist. His main contribution was in the field of comparative politics and comparative public administration. He was a member of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG) and a co-chairperson of the Council for European Studies based at Columbia University. According to Peter Alexis Gourevitch, Diamant was both “on the Executive Committee of the Council for European Studies (based in New York) and the Interuniversity Center for European Studies in Montreal.” Alfred Diamant was published by Princeton University Press and by top ranking journals like Administrative Science Quarterly, Comparative Political Studies, and PS. Political Science and Politics. (See List of publications) Diamant’s “areas of expertise” were “Comparative Western European Politics and Social Policy.” Together with his colleague, James Christoph, he “established Indiana University as a major site of the study of European culture, society and politics.” John D.Martz called the “works of Maurice Duvergier, Sigmund Neumann and Alfred Diamant” that focus on the study of political parties “Western European-oriented classics.” D.B. Robertson saw Alfred Diamant as “a gifted and humane scholar.”
Alfed Diamant came to the United States as a young man when the Fascists gained power in Germany and Austria. During WWII, he served in the U.S.army. He was married to Ann Diamant.
Lessons from history.
Alfred Diamant wrote his M.A. thesis on ‘Prototypes of Austro-German Fascism’ at Indiana University in 1948. By that time, it was already clear to him that he wanted to teach and do research at a university.
His focus on the anti-democratic developments in pre-WWII Europe is apparent in a number of large studies and minor contributions that he wrote since the 1950s. Diamant analyzed the role of Conservative political catholicism in Austria and its contribution to the rise of the clerical fascist Dollfuss regime. He also focused on the strengths and failures of the Left in (above all) Austria and Germany that preceded their defeat by fascism. Such works were motivated by a desire to enlighten people concerning the root causes and to prevent a return of what had occurred, no matter whether it might reappear in the form of a tragedy or as a farce. He was convinced that the repeat of mistakes, the return of the same was not inevitable. Instead of pessismism (which would have been understandable), a democratic optimism prevailed.
At the same time, Diamant also took a stand back home in the U.S., with regard to U.S. affairs. Like other open-minded, nonconformist intellectuals, he was opposed to witchhunts of the type practiced by Senator Joseph McCarthy. As early as 1950 he took a stand when he reviewed the book ‘Character Assassination’ by Jerome Davis that had just appeared. Another article published in the 1950s in The Western Political Quarterly also reflects his democratic commitment. It argued in favor of improved local government. 
Similarly, he defended the right of Vietnam war opponents to dissent in an article jointly written with two colleagues and published in the New York Times in 1965.
Rethinking Max Weber.
In the 1960s, Diamant focused increasingly on the critical study of institutional frameworks and thus, above all, on bureaucracy. Max Weber, the conservative he initially looked at without much sympathy, was now critically received and his important insights were adapted to fit the needs of a democratic societal project. (In similar fashion, progressives have been open to the reception of Clausewitz since the 1960s.) A key essay by Alfred Diamant, titled "The Bureaucratic Model: Max Weber Rejected, Rediscovered, Reformed," that appeared in Papers in Comparative Public Administrative Sciences (No. 1 1962,pp. 59–96), reveals this critical yet decisive reception of Max Weber. The author of ‘The American Bureaucracy,’ Richard J. Stillman, calls it an “insightful piece.” Dwight Waldo thinks it is important to “direct” the reader’s “attention” to it. As D.Waldo notes, it is in this essay that Diamant “reviews the vast array” of scholarly publications on bureaucracy respectively bureaucracies while at the same time “carefully and penetratingly examin what Weber "wrote" on, and relating to, bureaucracy. Diamant “evaluates, relates, and classifies; and ends up by setting forth proposals ‘for the comparative analysis of bureaucracies; using the Weberian ideal-type’[…” – as he had “modified it.”
Diamant emphasized the fact that “Weber associated bureaucracy with a legal-rational authority system.” This was what made it modern and what constituted its essence. Ideally, a ‘bureaucratic’ (or administrative) apparatus (or ‘institution’) had to be rational in order to function well. It also was tied to the rule of law (as opposed to absolutist or dictatorial arbitrary suspension of such rule of law). Ideally, this made its functioning dependable and foreseeable. Both qualities, ‘rationality’ and ‘rule of law,’ made bureaucracy a modern phenomenon. And its “authority” – in other words, the fact that it was accepted by the population – depended on both traits. There was nothing specifically Prussian about either ‘rationality’ or ‘rule of law.’ If the specific Prussian way of applying ‘rationality’ and ‘rule of law’ was deficient (or if, somewhat later, the bureaucratic ‘rationality’ of the fascists who organized the holocaust was horrible, just like the Nuremberg laws ( Nuernberger Gesetze) were horrible), this did not mean that the ideals had to be discarded as meaningful guideposts. Instead, they had to be filled, again and again, in given historical situations, with a material content that reflected both humane values and the concrete needs of the citizens.
Diamant was not necessarily a Weberian scholar. Referring to Weber’s ‘ideal-tye’ of bureaucracy, E. N. Suleiman observes, “Some saw in his model a rigid, Prussian-inspired influence that had but a tangential relationship to reality.” Suleiman points specifically to Diamant. Diamant knew indeed that Weber was a functional academic, whose profound insights into the workings of bureaucracies served the interests of the Wilhelminian authoritarian nation-state. Insofar Weber’s model was “a Prussian inspired model” just like Weber himself was a nationalist and per se anti-democratic. He represented and aided the status quo. But regardless of one’s social and political position regarding this status quo, how could one ignore his penetrating insights in the way bureaucracies function and regarding the (positive and negative) purposes they can serve? What mattered was to reflect his insights in the light of new, added knowledge and in the interest not of a ‘Leviathan’ of the Prusso-German type, but in the interest of a democratically constituted society. As far as the charge is concerned that Weber’s ‘ideal-type’ was ‘abstract’ and thus meaningless, Diamant knew full-well that science operates with abstractions. This certainly could not be held against the German scholar. Therefore, it is not surprising that “Diamant makes a valiant effort to defend and ‘resurrect’ Weber from the telling criticisms of scholars like Presthus, Beck and Berger. Weber, he notes, was not so naïve as to believe that his ideal-constructs had unqualified correspondence” in what we like to refer to as the real world. What mattered, according to Diamant, was to ‘modify,’ adapt, or surpass Weber’s constructs. It is well known that in the 20th century, several sociologists and political scientists “have sought to construct typologies that are closer approximations of the mixes or dualities existing in the real world. The Comparative Administration Group (…) was prominent in this field.”
As a member of this group, Diamant shared its basic orientation but did not see the necessity to discard Weber’s bureaucracy model entirely. There was too much in it that was still pertinent.
A pioneer in the field of Comparative Politics and Comparative Administration.
Robert H. Jackson states that “(s)ince World War II a new approach to the study of public administration (...) developed.” Comparative strategies of research were developed and this meant that “administrative behavior and practices (were) analyzed in widely different societies and cultures.” Alfred Diamant, a key member of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG), was part of this innovation of the discipline. “Among scholars who have contribute to the comparative studies of comparative bureaucratic systems (..., ) Monroe Berger, Alfred Diamant, Ferrel Heady, Robert Presthus and Michael Crozier” are singled out as particularly noteworthy by Pardeep Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan. Diamant’s grasp of European political cultures and his knowledge of American paradigms made a comparative orientation plausible. Dwight Waldo called his discussion of “The Relevance of Comparative Politics to the Study of Comparative Administration” an excellent methodological contribution. Empirical comparative studies are a thorough approach if one wants to understand the specific traits of Fascist or Stalinist bureaucracy. They could also serve to elucidate the positive and negative traits of French public administration, as a state bureaucracy subjected to dual political control. How did it work, in comparison to U.S. public administration? The focus on France mattered, for another reason, as well. France was practically a sister republic of the U.S., with a long republican and progressive tradition. It was another “common law country.” In his critique of Austrian conservatism, Diamant had “defined … European political Catholicism as a reaction of both clerics and laymen to the challenges of the French Revolution respectively the modern (liberal) state of the 19th century that was based on it. This ‘anti-modernist’ attitude manifests itself on different levels – on the level of ideas, by way of the formation of a distinct ‘Catholic philosophy’ and ‘culture,’ on the socio-economic level by way of the development of a ‘Catholic social doctrine,’ on the political level by way of the organization of Catholic movements and parties.” This is how G. Stimmer sums it up. France was in many ways an antipode of Austria. It was more modern, having been at the forefront of the industrial revolution, on the European continent, together with Belgium. Although Catholic, it was anti-clerical. Conservative forces were not almost constantly overwhelming Republicans. On top of it, it had a long administrative tradition anchored in Republicanism, though older roots of its ‘droit administratif’ (or legal framework pertaining to public administration), in the Royal Council of the ancien régime, existed. Diamant was especially interest in French developments that took place in the course of the first term of President Mitterrand. 
It is noteworthy, however, that Diamant did not idealize the situation in France. It is true that it was more liberal than Austria had been. It had a strong administrative tradition, and the French republic regulated the civil service by way of a body of laws pertaining to the country’s administration. If we would suppose, however, that in France, administrators can provide some “impetus for major reform,” we are mistaken, as Aberbach et al. have not failed to point out. They quote Diamant who stated flatly, “The French experience would indicate that, in fact, during periods of political indecision, the grand corps do not really govern the country, they simply continue routine operations, maintain the status quo, and protect their own interest.” Diamant obviously regrets that these administrators “could not carry through radical innovations.” Civil servants of the people should after all act efficiently and determinedly, in the interest of the people.
Focus on the ‘Third World’.
As far as “administrative science research” was “focused on developing countries,” it became increasingly comparative in orientation, as H.G. Steiffert noted. Steiffert singles out Alfred Diamant (1962) as well as Robert H. Presthus (1961), K. Henderson (1964), Amitai Etzioni (1967), and Berton H. Kaplan (1968) as the noteworthy theoretical contributors to the debate in the 1960s, while mentioning also the contribution of Edward W. Weidner (in 1970).
In the 1960s, it was above all the Comparative Administration Group (CAG) that was focused on Development Studies, especially after it had received a substantial grant from the Ford Foundation in 1962 that was to facilitate research on “methods for improving public administration in developing countries.” Among the noteworthy members of the CAG, Fred Riggs stands out. He had joined the faculty of the Government Department at Indiana University in 1956. In 1960, “his colleagues elected him chair of the comparative Public Group” (the CAG), a position he held until 1971.
This was the period when “the CAG became a forum for intellectuals attempting to understand in a systematic why administrative practices in non-Western countries diverged so widely from what were thought to be good and universal principles.” 
As a member of the Comparative Administration Group, based at Indiana University like Riggs, Diamant applied his insights into the importance of institutional frameworks of social change (frameworks that in themselves were not seen as static but as changeable and subject to change) to Third World Studies. He chose a ‘bureaucratic systems approach’ which Rodman describes as “(l)ess abstract and more obviously relevant” to its chosen purpose than the “input-output system approach” was as a “conceptual framework”. Several publications of Diamant that tackled methodological questions appeared in the 1960s. Schrader called Diamant’s Models of Bureaucracy and Development (Modellbetrachtung der Entwicklungsverwaltung.translated by Hans Jecht and published in German in 1967) “an important, relevant work.”
At least one of Diamant’s studies focused on racism in South Africa at the time. The apartheid regime was confronted by a liberation movement (Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC)) that was branded as terrorist by various governments. Change was necessary. Racism was unacceptable to Diamant who had suffered fascist racism. The study was supported by a subdivision of the European Commission.
Political science research tied to democratic values: The quest for democratic control.
In their ‘Introduction’ to Chapt.1 of their book on Public Administration, Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan stated, “The rise of the modern welfare state has expanded the scope of public administration. It has widened to the extent that now very few aspects of an individual’s life remain unaffected by public administration. This stands true for all societies, socialist, capitalist, and so on.” They also quote W.B.Donham who said, “If our civilization fails, it will be mainly because of a breakdown of administration. The recognition of the objective necessity of administrating ‘public things’ (in Latin: res publica) does not imply indifference to the question, ‘What sort of administration befits a democratic society?’ And therefore to such related questions as, ‘How can we, the people, make sure that administrative institutions serve us and respond to our needs, rather than vice versa?’ And furthermore, ‘How can we, the people, make sure that administrative institutions adapt to changing needs and arising challenges that society must deal with?’ - Diamant was convinced that if bureaucracies were unavoidable, at least they should not work against us or limit civil rights and the freedom of citizens unnecessarily; on the contrary, they should better our lot. And above all, they should be democratically controlled. How they could be controlled in the best way by the people and its elected servants was a problem that could be handled in a more rational way if empirical evidence of the pros and cons of actually employed models of political oversight was scrutinized in a comparative manner. Apparently, speaking of public institutions, efficiency, coordination, responsibility, oversight and (democratic) political control matter in democratic contexts.
Industrial democracy.
Alfred Diamant also turned to the question of industrial democracy. As always, his observations tended to be cool and objective, when he was discussing it. And yet, his study revealed a critical impetus. The analytic stance and the detachment may have made his critical observations even more effective. Discussing the German model which allowed trade-union representatives to sit on the board of corporations in the name of ‘joint decision-making’ or co-determination (‘Mitbestimmung’), P. Barach and A. Botwinick observed that Diamant provided a “thorough and perceptive study.” Diamant “concluded that the achievements of codetermination «so far are more nearly system-maintaining than system-transforming in character» […].” The words quoted, though carefully phrased and seemingly detached and objective, reveal a certain disappointment.
Diamant’s theoretical emphasis on “political development”.
Diamant hoped for ‘achievements’ or improvements, a ‘bettering’ of that which existed. In his view, change that corresponded to the felt needs of the population was inherently positive. This progressive bend of mind was basically inscribed in his theory of political development. Omar Guerrero sums up Alfred Diamant’s position by pointing out the specific quality that characterizes a process that the latter would describe as ‘political development’: political development is above all “creating conditions, within an institutional framework, that are suitable to the solution of a wide field of social problems.” Guerrero further describes Diamant’s position in this way: “A political system is engaged in a process of development if it can increase its capacity to attain successfully and continually new social goals and the creation of new types of organization. Such political development that leads to new institutional frameworks which allow the population to address social grievances in a new way is currently characteristic of a number of societies in South America. Keith R. Legg termed Diamant’s approach that “view(ed) political development (…) as ‘a generic process of successfully sustaining new demands, goals and organizations in a flexible manner’(…)” “most useful.”
Tradition and innovation.
Diamant’s insight that political institutions, despite their relative inertia, are not static but caught between the force of their ‘traditions’ and pressures for ‘innovation,’ and that for this very reason they reveal both their quality as ‘historical result’ (Resultatcharakter) and as a ‘historical process’ (Prozesscharakter) is perhaps the most significant feature of his critical approach that “modified” Max Weber’s comprehension of bureaucracies in contemporary society. This insight is at the root of his careful arguments in favor of improvement, innovation and development.
A strong belief in social justice.
Easily applied labels are not helpful in describing the human (rather than narrowly political) stand that Alfred Diamant was taking, both as citizen and as political scientist. Norman Furniss, a retired professor at Indiana University and a person who knew Alfred Diamant well, writes, that what was characteristic of him was “a belief that our country and our world can be more just and more decent” than they actually are. In this respect, he was very much like his wife, Ann, a feminist who had “a strong belief in social justice.”

<doc id="36587997" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36587997" title="Tin Can API">
Tin Can API

The Tin Can API, now officially known as "Experience API" (xAPI), is an e-learning software specification that allows learning content and learning systems to speak to each other in a manner that records and tracks all types of learning experiences. Learning experiences are recorded in a Learning Record Store (LRS). LRSs can exist within traditional Learning Management Systems (LMSs) or on their own.
Summary.
The Tin Can API is commonly referred to as "The Experience API" and "Next Generation SCORM". SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) has been the de facto e-learning standard for packaging e-learning content to be delivered to LMSs. However, there are several drawbacks to SCORM. The Tin Can API allows for several new capabilities that SCORM didn't, such as:
The Tin Can API is an open source API. It is a Representational state transfer web service that uses JavaScript Object Notation for its data format. The web service allows software clients to read and write experiential data in the form of “statement” objects. In their simplest form, statements are in the form of “I did this”, or more generally “actor verb object”. More complex statement forms can be used. There is also a built in query API to help filter recorded statements, and a state API that allows for a sort of “scratch space” for consuming applications.
History.
SCORM is over ten years old, and Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), the stewards of SCORM, recognized the need for a newer and more capable software specification. 
ADL issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) asking for assistance in improving SCORM. The BAA was awarded to Rustici Software, a leader in the industry of e-learning interoperability software. Rustici Software then conducted numerous interviews with the e-learning community to determine which factors were most important to improve upon, and developed the research version of the Tin Can API specification. This process was called Project Tin Can. 
The Tin Can API is was released as version 1.0 in April of 2013. There are currently over 80 adopters (15 July 2014).
Current Status.
The Tin Can API is currently at 1.0.1. 
Previous versions include:
1.0.0.
version 0.8 (official output of the BAA) and version 0.9 (research version specification)
0.95 (second research version specification).

Priocnemis susterai

Priocnemis susterai is a large species of Pepsid spider wasp and is, with "Priocnemis perturbator" and "Priocnemis coriacea", one of three similar species of the subgenus "Umbripennis" found in Great Britain which are characterised by having plentiful erect hair on the face and propodum.
Distribution.
Widespread in central and southern Europe but it is difficult to distinguish from the more common "P. perturbator". In Great Britain it is widely distributed in southern and central England as far north as north-east Yorkshire and westwards to Wales and Cornwall.
Habitat.
Open woodland with dry soils, avoids waterlogged areas.
Biology.
in Great Britain the flight period is April to August, and the species overwinters as an adult. Due to confusion with "P.. perturbator" prey records of the two species (formerly considered a single species "P. fuscus") prey records are nor reliable but it is probable that "P. susterai" preys on larger spiders of the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae. Although little is known about the nesting biology of "P. susterai", like other "Priocnemis" wasps ot probably excavates cells in pre-existing cavities. Like "P.. coriacea" the only flower it has been recorded nectaring at is wood spurge but it probably nectars at similar flowers with open corollas.

Alia Bhatt

Alia Bhatt (born 15 March 1993) is an Indian actress who appears in Bollywood films. She made her acting debut with Karan Johar's romantic comedy "Student of the Year" (2012), a box office success. She subsequently garnered praise for her performances in Imtiaz Ali's road movie "Highway" (2014) and the highly successful romantic comedy "2 States" (2014).
Early life.
Alia Bhatt was born on 15 March 1993, to Indian film director Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan. Her father is of primarily Gujarati descent while her mother is of Kashmiri and German ancestry. Bhatt has one sister, Shaheen (born 1988) and two half-siblings, Pooja Bhatt and Rahul Bhatt. Actor Emraan Hashmi and director Mohit Suri are her cousins while producer Mukesh Bhatt is her uncle. Bhatt graduated from Jamnabai Narsee School IBDP in May 2011.
Career.
Bhatt's first acting role was as a child artist in "Sangharsh" (1999), starring Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta where she played the younger version of Zinta's character. She had her first leading role in 2012 with Karan Johar's "Student of the Year", alongside Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan. She portrayed the role of Shanaya, a sophisticated teenage girl who is in a relationship with Dhawan's character but is attracted to the character played by Malhotra. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote of her performance, "Alia's role is reminiscent of Kareena Kapoor in "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham". Stylish, classy, born with a silver spoon, she's someone who loves to flaunt not just her clothes and bags, but also her riches. Extremely photogenic, Alia makes a super-confident debut." Film critic Anupama Chopra of "Hindustan Times" also mentioned the similarities with Kapoor's character, but noted that her performance was "without the killer attitude." "Student of the Year" was a financial success, grossing domestically.
In 2014, Bhatt played the protagonist of Imtiaz Ali's road film "Highway" opposite Randeep Hooda. Her portrayal of a lonely teenage girl who develops stockholm syndrome after being abducted was acclaimed by the critics. Rachit Gupta of "Filmfare" mentioned that "20, it’s surprising how Alia has got so many deft nuances right. It’s as if the actor has grown with the character. She is truly one of the most promising new actors in Hindi films." Sonia Chopra of Sify added that Bhatt is "[completely immersed" in her role, and that "Alia’s uninhibited and raw performance will have you emotionally invested in her character all through." Though the film underperformed at the box office, it earned profits with the aid of non-theatrical rights.
Bhatt next featured in Johar and Sajid Nadiadwala's joint production "2 States" with Arjun Kapoor. An adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's , it narrates the story of two IIM Ahmedabad students who encounter trouble in convincing their parents to approve of their relationship. For her role as Ananya Swaminatham, a headstrong Tamil girl, she learnt the language. Critics were appreciative of her performance with Rediff.com publishing that Bhatt "really grows into the character and makes you believe that she's a career-oriented IIM-A grad." Shubhra Gupta of "The Indian Express" added that Bhatt was a "surprise" and was "easy and fresh and natural." The film emerged as a major commercial success, earning over in domestic ticket sales.
As of May 2014, Bhatt has completed work on Johar's next production "Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania" alongside Varun Dhawan. She has also been signed on for Vikas Bahl's "Shaandar", a destination wedding film opposite Shahid Kapoor.
Other work.
Post her debut, Bhatt performed at several award functions like Filmfare, Screen, and Stardust apart from at an international event in Hong Kong with Varun Dhawan and Siddharth Malhotra. She also performed at a special event alongside Varun Dhawan, Sidharth Malhotra, Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor and Huma Qureshi to raise funds for the flood-affected victims of Uttarakhand. She went on to shoot a special PETA ad for cats and other homeless animals.
Bhatt performed playback singing along with Zeb for the song "Sooha Saaha" in "Highway". Music composer for the film A R Rahman invited her to his music school where she could undergo training.
In the media.
Bhatt is the ambassador of popular brands such as Coca-Cola, Garnier and Maybelline. Raedita Tandon, editor of "Filmfare", wrote about Bhatt, "After meeting Alia Bhatt, I came away with an unexpected feeling. Interviewing her was more like having a conversation with a gal pal. She's what one wishes every celebrity was – carefree and relaxed. There's no mincing of words with her and certainly no diplomacy. Maybe it's because she's all of 20 years. Or maybe she gets it from her father, Mahesh Bhatt. Either way, she's a delight. Though there has been a surge of young actors over the past years, only a few have managed to make a mark. Alia is definitely one of them. That too, with just her debut film, "Student of the Year". But she's under no delusions. She knows she has a long way to go and is willing to work her 'ass off'"

Kids' Night on Broadway

On Kids’ Night on Broadway, kids age 6-18 get to see a participating Broadway show for free when accompanied by a full-paying adult as well as dining deals and more. Kids’ Night on Broadway takes place each winter in New York City, as well as all year round in cities across the U.S.
__TOC__
History.
Kids’ Night on Broadway (KNOB) is a program of The Broadway League, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry. Designed to introduce young people to the magic of live theatre and make Broadway accessible to a new generation of theatergoers, Kids’ Night on Broadway has welcomed young people to Broadway shows in New York and on tour across the U.S. since the program was created in 1996 by The Broadway League and the Theatre Development Fund.
As the League’s signature national audience development program, Kids’ Night on Broadway offers children age’s 6-18 free admission to participating shows when accompanied by a full-paying adult. In addition, KNOB offers family-friendly restaurant and parking discounts. Since its inception in 1996 to KNOB 2012, over 175,000 kids have participated with over 250,000 tickets sold. Kids’ Night on Broadway takes place in other cities across the county, all year long.
Sponsors.
The New York Times is the presenting sponsor of Kids’ Night on Broadway, a program of The Broadway League. In 2012, Madame Tussauds New York was also an official sponsor. Official media partners were WABC-TV, Z100, and 103.5 KTU.
As 2012’s cause-related component, Kids' Night on Broadway saluted Givenik, the only place on the web to get Broadway tickets and have 5% donated to the charity of your choice.
Past Events.
Since its inception in 1996, Kids’ Night on Broadway has attracted thousands of kids to the program that not only offers discount tickets to Broadway shows, but also allows young theatergoers the opportunity to experience some of the behind the scenes magic of the theatre.
In 2000, Kids’ Night on Broadway expanded from not only one night, but to two nights of live theatre experience for kids, ages 6 to 18, across the country. KNOB also served as an anchor event for "Rising Stars Live Broadway Talent Contest," a talent contest where entrants won tickets to Broadway shows, signed posters, CDs, and more as well as be judged by professional agents, and the "Kids’ Fan Fair," which offered backstage activities including dance lessons, face painting, makeup design, and trying on Broadway costumes before the KNOB theatre performances.
2007’s KNOB events were sponsored by Autism Speaks. Fear-mongering about autism and Autism Speaks were printed on Kids' Night materials, on its websites, and at fanfest events at Madame Tussauds. Julie Andrews and daughter Emma Walton Hamilton acted as Kid’s Night on Broadway National Ambassadors for the event held at Madame Tussauds.
Rosie O'Donnell served as 2008’s Kids’ Night on Broadway National Ambassador. The event, sponsored by Madame Tussauds New York and The New York Times, included an educational component and pre-theatre events in addition to the discounted tickets. A party held at Madame Tussauds kicked off the event. Ms. O’Donnell served as the National Ambassador in 2009, as well.
In 2010, Adam Riegler, who played Pugsley in "The Addams Family" musical, acted as KNOB National Ambassador for a special Kids’ Night on Broadway Halloween Edition. This special edition of Kids’ Night saluted UNICEF and the 60th anniversary of its Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF program.
In New York City, KNOB took place on February 5–9, 2012. Participants experienced the behind-the-scenes magic of Broadway at a pre-theatre party at Madame Tussauds. Plus, Kids’ got to eat for less thanks to special family discounts at Times Square area restaurants.
The 2012 National Ambassador was Nick Jonas, then appearing as J. Pierrepont Finch in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." Presented by The New York Times. A free fan festival drew an estimated 3,000 kids and their parents to Madame Tussauds in New York.
Other past ambassadors include Kelly Ripa, Sarah Jessica Parker, and John Lithgow. Kids’ Night in Broadway has been hosted at a number of venues including Macy’s, Toys “R” Us, Madame Tussauds, Bowlmor Lanes, and Roseland Ballroom.

Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries he served as a commissioner for the surveying and suppression of chantries in Wiltshire and Salisbury in 1548. At some time before 1552 he was appointed auditor to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, uncle of King Edward VI. He served as surveyor of crown lands in Somerset after 1575. He was a JP for Dorset and/or Wiltshire in about 1589. 
He was elected MP for Malmesbury in 1559, Heytesbury in 1584 and possibly for Chippenham in 1586, which tenure may be confused with that of his son Lawrence II.

Church of Saint Panteleimon (Thessaloniki)

The Church of Saint Panteleimon () is a late Byzantine church in Thessaloniki, Greece, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The church lies in the eastern part of the old city, near the Tomb of Galerius (the "Rotunda"), at the junction of Iasonidou and Arrianou streets. Its current dedication to Saint Panteleimon was given to the church after the end of Ottoman rule in 1912, and its original dedication is therefore disputed. In Ottoman times, it was converted into a mosque in 1548 and became known as Ishakiye Camii ("Mosque of Ishak "), which in the prevailing scholarly interpretation points to an identification with the late Byzantine Monastery of the Virgin Peribleptos, also known as the Monastery of Kyr Isaac after its founder Jacob, who was the city's metropolitan bishop in 1295–1315 and became a monk with the monastic name of Isaac. A counter-argument however supports the theory that the present church is unrelated to the Peribleptos Monastery, and that it was converted into a mosque ca. 1500, when the city's "kadı" (judge), was Ishak Çelebi, whom the mosque was named after. However, the church's architecture and decoration, which date to the late 13th/early 14th centuries, appear to support the former view.
The church is of the tetrastyle cross-in-square type, with a narthex and a (now destroyed) ambulatory that is connected to two chapels (still extant). Very few of the building's original wall paintings survive. Ottoman remains include the base of the demolished minaret and a marble fountain.

Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud

Mohammed bin Faisal (born 1937) is a Saudi businessman and a member of House of Saud. He is one of the pioneers in the establishment of Islamic banking.
Early life and education.
Mohammed bin Faisal was born in Taif in 1937. He is the eldest child of the King Faisal and Iffat Al Thunayan who had nine children. He is full brother of Saud bin Faisal, Turki bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal, Sara bint Faisal and Haifa bint Faisal.
Muhammed bin Faisal was the first to study abroad among King Faisal's children. He attended both Lawrenceville School and Hun School. He then attended Swarthmore College. He earned his bachelor of science degree in business administration at Menlo College in California.
Early career.
Prince Mohammed began his career at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). In 1964, he was transferred to the ministry of water and agriculture. Next he was appointed director of saline water conversion department at the ministry in 1970. He contributed to the formation of the water desalination program. He was later named deputy minister of water and agriculture responsible for saline water affairs in 1974. He was also named as the governor of then newly founded saline water conversion corporation in November 1974. He resigned from office in July 1977.
Business activities.
Prince Mohammed began to deal with business after his resignation. During this period he financially supported a study about the feasibility of bringing Antarctic icebergs to Makkah. He established a firm for this objective, Iceberg Transport International. On 17 October 1977, he presented his proposal at a conference in London. His plan was the most promising scheme discussed at the conference. However, the findings of the study indicated that it was not feasible, since no iceberg could survive if it passes the equator.
His most significant investments are in the fields of banking and finance and he is one of the pioneers in Islamic banking. Being one of the Saudi nationals, who invested in Egypt, he is the founder of the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt that was established in Cairo in 1977. The bank was officially launched in 1979. The Sudan branch of the bank was also opened in 1977. He founded Dar Al Maal Al Islami Trust (the DMI group) in 1981. It was established in Geneva that is the international Islamic finance organisation and a parent institution for 55 Islamic banks. The DMI group is a Bahamas-incorporated holding company with a portfolio of Islamic banks in Bahrain, Niger, Egypt and Pakistan. Then he founded Faisal Private Bank in 1990 that is the pioneer banking institution in Islamic finance industry. Prince Mohammed is the chairman of its board of directors and of the Islamic Finance Group. Faisal Private Bank has several branches in different countries, including Switzerland. Its Switzerland branch was granted full banking license by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (FINMA) in August 2006. Prince Mohammed is also the former president of Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank, which was founded in 1975.
In addition to banking sector, Prince Mohammed has other business enterprises. He is a shareholder of Saudi and Gulf Enterprise Ltd. based in Jeddah.
Other positions.
Prince Mohammed is the chairman of the board of trustees of the King Faisal Foundation. He is also a member of Effat University's board of founders and of trustees.
Controversy.
Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the families of the victims launched a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed along with two other members of the House Saud, namely late Prince Sultan and Prince Turki, in addition to other people whom they accused of financing Al Qaeda. In 2009, further evidence was gathered by the families. A Washington lawyer, Michael Kellogg, represented Prince Muhammed in the lawsuit.
Personal life.
Mohammed bin Faisal is married to Muna bint Abdul Rahman bin Azzam Pasha, daughter of Azzam Pasha. He has three children: Amr, Maha and Reema. His son Prince Amr is also a businessman dealing with finance.
He was among the 500 influential Muslims list developed by Georgetown University's center for Muslim-Christian understanding in 2009.

Savannah Law School

Savannah Law School is a small, boutique law school located in Savannah, Georgia that takes a collaborative approach to legal education. The American Bar Association approved the opening on December 5, 2011, and the class of 2015 enrolled in August 2012.
Housed in the former Candler Hospital building, directly across from Forsyth Park, Savannah Law School offers both full- and part-time enrollment for the juris doctor (J.D.) degree.
History.
The law school was first opened by Atlanta's John Marshall Law School in the 1970s, but the campus was discontinued in the 1980s. The American Bar Association acquiesced to law school’s re-establishment as a branch campus of Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School in 2011. Savannah Law School is now in the process of independently gaining full ABA accreditation, however, as a branch campus of the fully accredited AJMLS, Savannah Law School's graduates are considered graduates of an ABA accredited law school and may take the bar in any state.
Campus.
Savannah Law School is housed in the former Warren A. Candler Hospital building on Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah, GA. Constructed in 1819, among 26 Seaman’s Hospitals chartered by an Act of Congress in 1791, the building is the oldest hospital in the state of Georgia and used as such until 1980. Several tenants occupied the building sporadically from 1980 until 2009. In 2012, the Historic Preservation Board approved Savannah Law School's comprehensive restoration of the 110,000 square foot facility and the restoration will meet federal historic preservation standards. The estimated cost of the renovation is $10 million and once completed the renovations will represent one of the largest projects to restore an historic property in the United States.
The Candler Oak Tree is also located on the campus. In 2004, the Candler Oak was placed on the National Register of Historic Trees and at approximately 300 years of age is thought to be one of the oldest living landmarks in the region. The Savannah Tree Foundation holds a conservation easement to the tree. The law school adopted the tree as its logo.
Statistics.
In 2013, Savannah Law School increased its entering class size by 11%. The median LSAT for the entire 1L class is a 151; however, the median LSAT for the full-time program is a 153 and the part-time program is a 149. 45% of SLS's entering class moved from outside of Georgia to attend the law school. The gender distribution is 63% female and 37% male. 16% of the 2013 entering class are minorities and 14% are military veterans. The median age for the full-time program is 26 and the median age for the part-time program is 34.
Admissions.
Savannah Law School runs on a rolling admissions basis and applications may be submitted through the Law School Admissions Council by using school code 5344.

Uberto Gambara

Uberto Gambara (1489–1549) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography.
Uberto Gambara was born in Brescia on January 23, 1489, the son of Gianfrancesco Gambara and Alda Pio di Carpi. Veronica Gambara was his sister.
When he was 10 years old, he was destined for a career in the church. He was named provost of Verolanuova and chaplain of San Giacomo in 1502. He briefly left the ecclesiastical state, fighting alongside his brother Brunoro in the French army of Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours then invading Brescia. 
He then reentered the ecclesiastical estate, traveling to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Leo X. The pope named him nuncio to the Kingdom of Portugal, a post he would continue to occupy during the papacies of Pope Adrian VI and Pope Clement VII. The latter pope then named him nuncio to the court of Francis I of France. In 1527, he became nuncio to the Kingdom of England. There, he coordinated with the papal legate to England, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York. On December 15, 1527, he carried Cardinal Wolsey's letter to Pope Clement VII in which Wolsey secretly expressed his wish to be granted special powers allowing him to annul the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon, thus allowing the king to marry Anne Boleyn. 
Pope Clement VII was imprisoned by imperial troops following the Sack of Rome (1527). During this period, Gambara traveled to Paris to attempt to raise military assistance to free the pontiff.
On May 8, 1528, he was elected bishop of Tortona, coinciding with the pope naming him governor of Bologna, holding this post until 1533. He was present at the imperial coronation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna on February 24, 1530. At the end of his governship, he was finally consecrated as a bishop in February 1533 in Bologna by Gian Matteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona.
In 1539, Pope Paul III made him vicar of Rome. He then made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of December 19, 1539. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Silvestro in Capite on January 28, 1540. He opted for the titular church of San Martino ai Monti on March 23, 1541. On January 9, 1542, he was named administrator of the see of Policastro, resigning that administration on June 7, 1543. 
He was the papal legate in Parma and Piacenza from January 27, 1542 until March 5, 1544. He opted for the titular church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine on February 15, 1542 and then for San Crisogono on October 17, 1544.
He was the Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, January 9, 1545 to January 8, 1546. He was then sent to France, returning to Rome on December 16, 1547. On March 22, 1548, he resigned the government of the see of Tortona in favor of his nephew, Cesare Gambara. He then traveled to Genoa, returning to Rome on January 5, 1549.
He died in Rome on February 14, 1549. His remains were returned to Brescia and he was buried in Santa Maria delle Grazie.

Common Language Information Services

Common Language Information Services encompasses several products that are in general use by the global telecommunications industry through license agreements. Common Language products combine numerics and mnemonics to establish naming conventions that telecommunication companies use to exchange critical information via Operations Support Systems and other interface mechanisms. 
Common Language codes help communications companies name, locate, inventory and manage all aspects of their networks. They identify items as large as a building, as small as a single board in a digital switching machine and as complex as a customer circuit. Telcordia manages the registry for all Common Language codes on behalf of the telecommunication service providers industry.
Common Language code sets are recognized by industry standards bodies and organizations, including ATIS, ANSI, IETF, and ETSI.
Following are Common Language codes used by the telecommunications industry.
CLEI Codes
Common Language Equipment Identifier or CLEI code is an industry standard, globally unique identifier for telecommunications equipment with a uniform feature-oriented classification. CLEI codes must be acquired by telecommunications equipment manufacturers and assigned to devices before they are sold to a licensed service provider.
CLLI Codes
A Common Language Location Identification or CLLI code identifies buildings that contain telephony equipment, network facilities housed in those buildings and non-building sites such as poles and manholes. By labeling the equipment functionality, office number, city, and state in a CLLI code, a telecommunication company’s central office can keep this information on and immediately reference any particular item when necessary. This information can be used for making repairs, replacing old equipment, ordering phone service, recovering call detail records, and assisting in tracing calls.
CLCI S/S
Special Service Circuit or CLCI S/S codes provide a coded designation for a service that is dedicated and billed to a particular customer.
CLCI MSG
Message Trunk Circuit or CLCI MSG codes provide a naming scheme for message trunk circuits. These codes identify individual trunks and trunk groups by number, office class, traffic use, trunk type modifier, signaling, and the originating and terminating office locations.
CLFI
Common Language Facility Identification or CLFI Codes provide a standard, mnemonic naming scheme to uniquely identify cable and transmission facilities between two standardized locations (identified via CLLI codes) within a network. It comprises facility designation, facility type, channel/pair/time slot, location of facility terminal A and location of facility terminal Z.
NC/NCI
Network Chanel/Network Channel Interface or NC/NCI codes are used to communicate technical attributes of services, facilities and their associated interfaces to support interconnections between telecommunications service providers through the use of the Access Service Request (ASR) process.
Service Order Process
The service order process utilizes the USOC, USO and Field Identifiers (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. Universal Service Order or USO Codes are used by telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of a customer’s service. Field Identifiers or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of a customer’s account. FIDs define the technical parameters required to provision and bill a customer’s service beyond those described in USOCs.
General Codes
General Codes provide a naming scheme that applies across the industry to identify company names, equipment frames, service centers, design routes, signaling types, circuit switch originating equipment, distributing frame cross-connect points and standard abbreviations.

Insured Cash Sweep

The Insured Cash Sweep® (ICS)or ICSSM service is used by banks and savings associations that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Financial institutions that are in the ICS Network can place the deposits received from their customers into interest-bearing savings accounts at other FDIC-insured banks in the Network.1 Because the funds are placed at multiple banks across the Network in amounts that stay within the FDIC deposit insurance limit at each bank ($250,000), the customer is eligible for total amounts of deposit insurance that are greater than the standard insurance limit for any one bank.2
The customer's relationship bank sets the interest rate offered on the entire deposit amount, and the customer gets one statement from the bank covering the full amount of the deposit.3 The Bank of New York Mellon provides custody, settlement, and recordkeeping services for the ICS service.
ICS is referred to as a "sweep" service because the customer's funds are transferred from a transaction account at the relationship bank into the savings accounts at other banks in the ICS Network. Each customer may make up to six withdrawals per month in the amounts that have been placed into the savings at the other banks.4
The provider of the Insured Cash Sweep is Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC which is based in Arlington, Virginia5 Promontory also offers the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service® or CDARS® service, and the Insured Network DepositSM or IND® service.6 The CDARS service allocates deposits in a way that is similar to the ICS service, but allocates the funds to time deposits (certificates of deposit or CDs) at other Network banks, whereas the ICS service allocates the funds to money market deposit accounts.

Mud Mountain Dam

Mud Mountain Dam is a dam in King County, Washington, a few miles southeast of Enumclaw. 
The dam was finished in 1948 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, although the project had been authorized by an act of Congress in June 1936. Construction had begun in 1939 and was delayed by World War II. At 432 feet high, it was the highest rock- and earth-filled dam in the world at its completion.
Mud Mountain Dam impounds the White River for flood control. From the 1870s local farmers of King and Pierce County competed for water from the White River, dealing not only with periodic flooding but with changes in its channel, notably in 1906 when the White permanently broke through to the shorter, southward channel of the Stuck River. Consultation with the engineer Hiram M. Chittenden eventually led to the decision to dam the river. 
The created reservoir, Mud Mountain Lake, is a riverine, marshy intermittent lake. The Corps of Engineers operates a day-use park at the dam site, the Mud Mountain Recreational Area, with picnic facilities, interpretive exhibits, and ten miles of hiking trails.

Ocean Giants

Ocean Giants is a 2011 British nature documentary series narrated by actor Stephen Fry. The series is a production of the BBC Natural History Unit, and first premiered on 14 August 2011. The documentaries focus on the life of dolphins and whales. The series includes film crew members who worked on the series "Planet Earth". The cameramen featured in the show are Doug Allen, a winner of four Emmys and four BAFTAs for his work on filming marine mammals, and Didier Noirot, known for working with marine conservationist Jacques Cousteau.
The series consists of three episodes, each an hour long. The first episode, "Giant Lives", focuses on humpback whales and blue whales, The second, "Deep Thinkers", explores the cognitive abilities of dolphins. The third and final episode, "Voices of the Sea", investigates the vocalizations of dolphins and whales. The series was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 6 March 2012 by BBC Home Entertainment, but only for the United States. 
Reception.
The series premiered with 5.45 million viewers. Critical reception of the series was mixed. Benji Wilson of "The Daily Telegraph" criticized the first episode for being "underwhelming," writing that although the series showcased plenty of footage of the whales, "it’s hard for television to communicate their awesome bigness." Amol Rajan of "The Independent" voiced a similar concern, pointing out that "there was a failure to convey the sheer size of these beasts because the only thing we had to compare them with was each other." Rajan did praise the show for its underwater photography, calling it "stunning." Phil Hogan of "The Guardian" disliked the slow pacing of the series, writing that "it seemed to take hours to get whales in and out of shot." Hogan commented that it was difficult to distinguish scenes of the humpback whales in battle with scenes of the whales merely swimming, although "there was action to be had... with killer whales."

German submarine U-250

German submarine "U-250" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 9 January 1943 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 684. She was launched on 11 November 1943 and commissioned on 12 December under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Werner-Karl Schmidt.
In one patrol, she sank one ship.
The boat was sunk by the Soviet submarine chaser "MO103" in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic) in July 1944.
Service history.
After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, "U-249" transferred to the 8th flotilla on 1 July 1944.
Patrol, loss and capture.
The boat's first and only patrol was preceded by a pair of short trips between Kiel in Germany, and Reval (now Tallinn in Estonia), and Grand Hotel (Poland). "U-250"s first sortie proper started with her departure from Grand Hotel on 26 July 1944. She sank the Soviet submarine chaser or patrol boat "M-105" on 26 July.
This sinking resulted in a concerted response on the part of the Soviets. "M-103" made the kill; dropping a pattern of depth charges which opened a large hole in the U-boat's pressure hull. Only six men escaped the submarine, forty-six others did not; the U-boat sank in the relatively shallow depth of . It was decided to raise "U-250", despite her proximity to the German-held shore. Harassing artillery fire was met with a constant smokescreen while divers worked. The Soviets succeeded in raising the boat and taking her to Kronstadt in September 1944 where she was examined. She then served briefly in the Soviet navy as the "TS-14" before being broken up.
Armament.
FLAK weaponry.
"U-250" was mounted with a single 3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U gun on the LM 42U mount. The LM 42U mount was the most common mount used with the 3.7 cm Flak M42U. The 3.7 cm Flak M42U was the marine version of the 3.7 cm Flak used by the Kriegsmarine on Type VII and Type IX U-boats.

The Bard (GB horse)

The Bard (1883-1902) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He was owned by Robert Peck and Owen Williams. Robert Peck was also his trainer. He won 23 of his 25 races, including the Goodwood Cup and Doncaster Cup in 1886. He also finished second in to Ormonde in the Epsom Derby.
Background.
The Bard was a light-coloured chestnut standing just over 15 hands high. He was a son of 2000 Guineas and St. Leger Stakes winner Petrarch. After retiring from racing Petrarch had success as a sire, with his progeny including Busybody and Miss Jummy. The Bard's dam was Magdalene. She was a race winner and a daughter of Syrian.
Racing career.
The Bard was undefeated as a two-year-old, winning 16 races including the Brocklesby Stakes, and £9188 in prize money. His record for the most wins in a season by a British juvenile was not equaled until Provideo won 16 times in 1984. In his first race as a three-year-old he faced 2000 Guineas winner Ormonde in the 1886 Epsom Derby. Ormonde was the 40/85 favourite and The Bard was the 7/2 second favourite. Half way down the finishing straight The Bard, ridden by Charles Wood, was slightly in front of Ormonde, but as soon as Ormonde's jockey asked for an effort he went clear. Ormonde went on to win the race by 1½ lengths from The Bard, who was about 10 lengths clear of St. Mirin in third. The Bard then won the Goodwood Cup in a walkover and won the Doncaster Cup.
Stud career.
In 1887 he was sold for 10,000 guineas to Henri Say for breeding and he was a successful stallion in France, becoming champion sire there in 1894 and 1901. He died at Lormoy Stud in France on 14 March 1902.

<doc id="36588540" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36588540" title="Norwich City F.C. in European football">
Norwich City F.C. in European football

Norwich City Football Club is an English football club based in Norwich, Norfolk. The club was founded in 1902 and has competed in the English football league system since 1920. Their first and so far only season in UEFA-sanctioned cup competition came when they reached the third round of the UEFA Cup in the 1993–94 season. They also took part in the Texaco Cup and the Anglo-Scottish Cup in the 1970s.
History.
1972–73 Texaco Cup.
Norwich's first taste of European competition was in the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the first round, Norwich faced Scottish club Dundee. A 2-1 loss was perhaps not the most auspicious of starts but a 2-0 win in the second leg saw Norwich safely through to the second round, where Norwich were pitted against Leicester City. After a 2-0 home win each and no decider after extra time, Norwich progressed by winning the penalty shoot-out 4-3. In the third round, Norwich played Motherwell and beat them in both legs to set up a contest with local rivals Ipswich Town in the Final. Norwich were beaten in both legs.
1973–74 Texaco Cup.
After being beaten finalists the previous year, Norwich had a second go at the Texaco Cup in the 1973–74 season. Their first round opponents would again hail from Scotland; Perth side St. Johnstone. Norwich beat them home and away to get through to the second round, where Norwich would again face Motherwell and just as in the semifinal the year before, overcame them in both legs. They then took on Lancashire club Burnley. "The Clarets" beat City 5-2 on aggregate to send them out.
1974–75 Texaco Cup.
The Texaco Cup format was changed in the 1974–75 season. Group stages were introduced for the English clubs. Each team would play the others in the group once, with only the team finishing top of the group progressing. The four Scottish clubs would join in at the quarter-final stage. Norwich were in Group 1, with Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion and Peterborough United. Norwich kicked off the tournament with a 2-1 home win against Peterborough, however a 5-1 defeat at the Hawthorns to West Bromwich Albion and a 2-1 loss to Birmingham at their St Andrew's ground meant Norwich finished bottom of their group.
1975–76 Anglo-Scottish Cup.
After Texaco dropped their sponsorship of the tournament, the Anglo-Scottish Cup was created in the 1975–76 season, using largely the same format as the Texaco Cup the previous year, but with the introduction of a Scottish Qualifier round to select four from eight teams for the quarter-final stage. Norwich were in Group 4 of the English Qualifiers, with Fulham, Chelsea and Bristol City. Norwich only picked up one point - that coming from a 1-1 draw away at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge - and finished bottom of their group. Fulham progressed from Group 4, and went on to be beaten in the final by Middlesbrough.
1976–77 Anglo-Scottish Cup.
In the 1976–77 season of the Anglo-Scottish Cup Norwich were the only non-London club in Group 3: Fulham, Chelsea and Orient provided the opposition. Draws with all three teams saw "the Canaries" finish second to Orient, who would be beaten in the Final by Nottingham Forest.
1977–78 Anglo-Scottish Cup.
Fulham, Chelsea and Orient would again be Norwich's opposition in the 1977–78 season of the Anglo-Scottish Cup. Draws with Orient and Chelsea either side of a 1-0 defeat at home to Fulham meant that Norwich were eliminated. Fulham progressed, but were knocked out by St. Mirren in the first quarterfinal.
1978–79 Anglo-Scottish Cup.
For the third successive Anglo-Scottish Cup, Norwich and Orient would be pitted against each other in a group that also featured Nottinghamshire clubs Mansfield Town and Notts County. Draws with Mansfield and Orient after a 2-1 away defeat to Notts County saw Norwich again fail to progress past the group stages. This would be the last time Norwich took part in the Anglo-Scottish Cup, which was scrapped after the 1980–81 tournament.
1985–91.
Norwich won the 1984–85 Football League Cup, giving them a place in the 1985–86 UEFA Cup. However, English clubs were banned from taking part in European competition in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster. As a compromise, the Super Cup was created, with the clubs that would have taken part in European competition that year (league champions Everton, FA Cup winners Manchester United, and fellow UEFA Cup qualifiers Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur) participating. Norwich were placed in Group 1 with Everton and Manchester United. A home win and an away loss against Everton and two draws against Manchester United saw Norwich progress with Everton to the semifinals, where they faced Liverpool. A 1-1 home draw in the first leg and 3-1 away defeat sealed Norwich's elimination, and Liverpool carried on to face Everton in a Merseyside derby in the Final, which Liverpool won 7-2 on aggregate. The Super Cup was never held again, and was ostensibly replaced by the Full Members Cup.
Norwich would be denied places in the UEFA Cup twice more: in 1986–87 Norwich finished fifth. Had the usual rules been in place, the club would join Liverpool, Tottenham and 1986–87 Football League Cup winners Arsenal in the 1987–88 tournament. City's finish of fourth place in the 1988–89 season would ordinarily have secured qualification for the 1989–90 tournament, however the ban was still in force. It remained so until 1990–91, with England not getting back all their allocation of clubs to send to European competition until 1995–96.
1993–94 UEFA Cup.
"The Canaries", managed by Mike Walker, achieved a third place finish in the 1992–93 season; the first season of the new FA Premier League. It was the club's highest league finish to date, and for much of the season they had been surprise contenders for the league title. Thus, along with Aston Villa, Norwich would represent England in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup. Norwich's first opponents were Vitesse. A 3-0 home win in the first leg and a 0-0 draw away at Nieuw Monnikenhuize were enough to see Norwich through to the second round, where they would face three-time European champions FC Bayern Munich. A famous 2-1 win at the Olympic Stadium in Munich was followed up with a 1-1 draw at Carrow Road, ensuring that City would progress to the third round. Again Norwich would face a former European Cup winner, this time in the shape of Italian club Inter Milan. The East Anglian club's participation in the competition was ended at this stage as the "Nerazzurri" ran out one-nil winners in both legs.

Geoff Ellis

Geoffrey Phillip Ellis (born 24 May 1950) is a former Welsh cricketer. Ellis was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born at Llandudno, Caernarfonshire.
Career with Glamorgan.
Ellis made his first-class debut for Glamorgan against Oxford University in 1970. He made eight first-class appearances for the county in that season, scoring 318 runs at an average of 26.50, with a high score of 55. This score was one of two half centuries he made in his debut season. He also made his List A debut in the 1970 John Player League against Nottinghamshire, with him making three further appearances in that seasons competition, In 1971, he made just a single first-class appearance against Lancashire in the County Championship. In the following season, Ellis made six appearances for Glamorgan, scoring 223 runs at an average of 20.27, with a high score of 54. As was the case in 1971, he did not feature in any List A matches during the season. In 1973, Ellis made eleven first-class appearances, scoring 322 runs at an average of 18.94, with a high score of 64, which was his only score of above fifty that season. He made his first List A appearance since his debut season in 1970, playing one match each against Minor Counties South in the Benson & Hedges Cup and Gloucestershire in the Gillette Cup, as well as making five List A appearances in the John Player League. He scored a total of 128 runs in his seven List A appearances in 1973, which came at an average of 21.33, with a high score of 47 not out.
In 1974, Ellis made ten first-class appearances, scoring 356 runs at an average of 22.25, in the process recording his maiden, and what would be his only, first-class century, with a score of 116 against Middlesex at Sophia Gardens. He also made fifteen List A appearances in 1974, spread across the Benson & Hedges Cup, Gillette Cup and John Player League, scoring 107 runs at a low average of 11.88, with nearly half of his List A runs in that season coming against Worcestershire in the John Player League, which was also his maiden half century in that format. He also had his first season of note with the ball, with Ellis seeing some success in one-day cricket, with 14 wickets at a bowling average of 29.00, with best figures of 3/22. In 1975, Ellis made his most first-class appearances in a season for Glamorgan up to that point, with eighteen. In these, he scored a total of 624 runs at an average of 18.90, with a high score of 63, one of only two times he passed fifty in first-class cricket in that season. His part-time medium pace bowling was also further utilised in this season, with him taking 15 wickets in first-class cricket at an average of 46.80, with best figures of 46.80. This was to be his most successful season with the ball, eclipsing the four wickets he took in 1974. In List A cricket, he made seventeen appearances in 1975, scoring 337 runs at an average of 30.63, with a high score of 66, which was one of three half centuries he made in that format in that season. He also saw success with the ball in one-day cricket in 1975, taking 18 wickets at an average of 33.38, with best figures of 3/16. 1976 was to be Ellis' final season playing first-class and List A cricket for Glamorgan. He played twenty first-class matches in that season, with his final appearance coming against Kent in the 1976 County Championship. He scored 770 runs, his most in any given season, which came at an average of 20.26, with a high score of 74, one of four half centuries he made in that season. He also made nineteen List A appearances in that season, the of which came against Somerset in the John Player League, with him scoring 487 runs at an average of 27.05, with a high score of 97 not out. This score was one of four half centuries he made in that season, with his unbeaten score of 97 against Yorkshire his highest score in that format.
In total, Ellis made 75 first-class appearances, scoring 2,673 runs at an average of 20.72. With the ball, he took 24 wickets at an average of 59.08, with best figures of 2/20. In List A cricket, he made a total of 62 appearances, scoring 1,086 runs at an average of 23.10. With the ball, he took 40 wickets at an average of 30.35, with best figures of 3/16.
Later career.
He later played for Wales in the 1979 ICC Trophy, a qualification tournament for the 1979 World Cup. He made three appearances during the tournament, against the Netherlands, Israel and the United States.

Madhu Trehan

Madhu Purie Trehan is a veteran Indian journalist and the founding editor of the leading Indian news magazine "India Today".
Biography.
Trehan studied abroad, first at Harrow Technical College & School of Arts in London in 1968, learning journalistic photography, and later at Columbia University in New York, where she earned a master's degree in journalism in 1971. While in New York, she worked at the United Nations in their press department, and served as an editor for a weekly newspaper, "India Abroad".
Trehan returned to India in 1975 when she founded and started the news magazine "India Today", with her father V.V.Purie, owner of Thomson Press. Trehan left the magazine to her brother’s stewardship in 1977 during her pregnancy, and returned to New York to start her family. Upon her return to India in 1986, Trehan produced and anchored "Newstrack", India’s first video news magazine, which earned her a reputation as a pioneering investigative journalist.
In 2009 Trehan published her first book, "Tehelka as Metaphor: Prism Me a Lie, Tell Me a Truth", examining the 2001 Operation West End exposé and its aftermath. Operation West End was an undercover operation conducted by the Tehelka website which exposed "bribing of army officers and senior political leaders in an arms deal". After the scandal broke, the journalists and the website itself became an object of counterattack, and investors in the website were hounded out of business. Trehan's book goes beyond detailing the original scandal to discussing how corruption has become the stock in trade for all levels of Indian society.
Trehan has written for leading news magazines and newspapers such as "Outlook India" and "Hindustan Times". In 2000 she launched Wah India, a website and print magazine. She, along with three other colleagues, also launched a media critique website called News Laundry in February 2012.
Controversy.
On May 25, 2001 the Delhi High Court ruled 3–2 that Trehan and four other journalists on Wah India were guilty of contempt of court for an article which they published “rating the High Court's Judges in terms of various attributes and qualities”. The article purportedly interviewed 50 unnamed senior lawyers to reach its conclusions. In April, the court had ordered Delhi police to seize copies of the offending issue from newsstands and raid the magazine’s Delhi office. The court also banned the media from reporting on the case, but withdrew the ban on May 2 in response to media protest. Three days after being found in contempt of court, Trehan and her colleagues apologized to the justices, and their apology was accepted.
Her book 'Prism Me A Lie Tell Me A Truth: Tehelka As Metaphor' courted controversy when a fellow and renowned journalist Karan Thapar down-reviewed her book in the section "Sunday sentiments" of Hindustan times titled 'Truly sorry, Madhu'. In an unprecedented approach, she replied to the review in the same newspaper by an article 'Who's afraid of Karan Thapar?' describing the review as personal and motivated. Their rivalry continued on Trehan's show 'Can you take it', where she lambasted Thapar for his antagonistic style of interview.
Personal.
Trehan is married to Indian heart surgeon Naresh Trehan.

Makkabi Helsinki

Makkabi Helsinki is a Finnish Jewish sports club in Helsinki, Finland. It is the oldest Jewish sports club in the world that has an uninterrupted history. It was founded in 1906 with the name “Stjärnan”' (Swedish for ‘the star’). The current name was adopted in 1936.
In association football, the club played in the top-flight competition Mestaruussarja in 1930, after that on lower levels. These days the main sports are bowling, futsal, basketball and floorball. The club celebrated its centennial in November, 2006.
The president of the club, Dennis Mattsoff, has mentioned Elias Katz as the most celebrated athlete to have represented this club. Katz won gold in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris with Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola in the 3000m team race. He also won a silver medal in the 3000 meter steeple chase race.
According to Mattsoff, the objective of the club is to strengthen the Jewish identity of the community in Helsinki, and to help the youngsters acquire also values other than those relating to competitive sports.
The club had its worst setback in history at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium on 21 June 1938, when its athlete Abraham Tokazier participated in a 100 metre race. He was officially declared to have come fourth, but on the basis of photographs and other pieces contemporary of evidence, it has been surmised that in reality he won the race. A possible reason for foul play on the part of the organisers was the fact that among the spectators there was a delegation from Nazi Germany.

Mamiya Press

The Mamiya Press is a line of medium-format rangerfinder system camera manufactured by Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and a wide array of accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm × 9 cm, but images can be taken in a number of different formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have flash sync terminals. The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.
Models.
Mamiya Press.
The original Mamiya Press was introduced in 1960 with the M-type back attachment system. It came with a 90 mm lens and has a bellows mechanism on the back that allows up to 15 degrees of tilt and 31 mm of extension.
Mamiya Press G.
The Press G, introduced in 1963, is identical to the original except for the G-type back attachment system, which is compatible with Graflex Speed Graphic cameras.
Mamiya Press S.
The Press S is a simplified version of the original camera, introduced in 1964. It features a fixed 105 mm lens and does not have a rear bellows.
Mamiya 23 Standard.
The 23 Standard was a version of the original without the rear bellows introduced in 1965. The name was changed to reflect the camera's ability to use 2×3 film (with the right film holder).
Mamiya Super 23.
Introduced in 1967, the Super 23 was the first major revision in the series. The body was redesigned, but still retains the rear bellows system. The much larger viewfinder includes selectable bright lines for the 100 mm, 150 mm, and 250 mm lenses for the first time. The 100 mm lens became standard.
Mamiya Universal.
The final model was introduced in 1969 and lacks the rear bellows. Instead, Polaroid backs can be mounted directly on the camera, and M-type and G-type backs with the appropriate adapter.

Bartolomeo Guidiccioni

Bartolomeo Guidiccioni (1470–1549) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography.
Bartolomeo Guidiccioni was born in Lucca in 1470, the son of a patrician family. He studied the human sciences, theology, and law in Rome.
At Rome, he entered the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, "seniore", the future Pope Paul III. He became Cardinal Farnese's vicar general in the diocese of Parma. He also became the governor of Farfa Abbey. After Cardinal Farnese became pope in 1534, Guidiccioni served as a datary from 1536 to 1539. He returned to Lucca, where he took an interest in literary and devotional matters.
In 1539, Pope Paul III recalled Guidiccioni to Rome. Guidiccioni was elected bishop of Teramo on December 12, 1539, and one week later, in the consistory of December 19, 1539, the pope made him a cardinal priest. He was not consecrated as a bishop at this time, though he did receive the red hat and the titular church of San Cesareo in Palatio on January 28, 1540.
He was a member of a congregation of three cardinals that approved the establishment of the Society of Jesus; he was a dissenting voice on the congregation, opposing the approval of the establishment of the order, but after the pope issued the papal bull "Regimini militantis Ecclesiae" approving the order, Cardinal Guidiccioni became a strong supporter. On August 27, 1540, he was named to a commission to study reform of the Roman Rota.
On March 22, 1542, he resigned the government of Teramo because his duties in Rome made him unable to visit it. He served as governor of Rome during this period. In 1542, he became the inquisitor general of the Roman Inquisition. He also served as Grand Penitentiary and Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura. In all, his published legal writings exceed twenty volumes.
On January 5, 1543, the pope named him to a commission to study church reform. On March 17, 1543, Cardinal Guidiccioni and twelve other cardinals accompanied the pope to Bologna. He was one of eight cardinals appointed on May 11, 1543 to a commission to manage the affairs of the upcoming Council of Trent.
He opted for the titular church of Santa Prisca on September 24, 1543. He served as administrator of the see of Chiusi from April 2, 1544 until February 20, 1545. On November 2, 1544, the pope officially made him a member of the upcoming Council of Trent.
Shortly after the start of the council, on May 26, 1546, he was transferred to the see of Lucca. He finally received episcopal consecration from the hands of Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi in the Sistine Chapel on August 28, 1546. From January 7, 1547 to January 13, 1548, he was Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals.
Cardinal Guidiccioni died in Rome on November 4, 1549. His remains were transferred to Lucca and he was buried in Lucca Cathedral.

Symphony in F (Dohnányi)

Ernő Dohnányi completed his first symphony, unnumbered and entitled Symphony in F, in 1896, while a student of Hans von Koessler. It was never formally published, and although awarded the Hungarian King's Prize, it did not achieve significant critical acclaim. The work, like many of Dohnányi's early compositions, bears the imprint of Johannes Brahms, who had championed the young composer after hearing a performance of Dohnányi's "Piano Quintet No. 1". The "Symphony in F" was given moderate attention after being recorded in 2011. It is approximately thirty minutes in length.
It requires 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani and strings and while not published in his lifetime, exists in sketches and score at the National Széchényi Library, Budapest. It was premiered 2 June 1897, in Budapest with Gyula Erkel (son of Ferenc) conducting.
Form.
Dohnányi wrote the work in the traditional four-movement symphonic format. He marks the score with the following:
Recording.
In 2011, the symphony's premiere recording (and only recording to date) was conducted by László Kovács.

Stable-isotope probing

Stable-isotope probing is a technique in microbial ecology for tracing fluxes of nutrients in biogeochemical cyling by microorganisms. A heavier stable isotope is can be enriched in a substrate that is consumed by the organisms to be studied. Biomarkers with the heavier isotope incorporated into them can be separated from biomarkers containing the more naturally abundant lighter isotope by isopycnic centrifugation. For example, 13CO2 can be used to find out which organisms are actively photosynthesizing or consuming new photosynthate. As the biomarker, DNA with 13C is then separated from DNA with 12C by centrifugation. Sequencing the DNA identifies which organisms were consuming existing carbohydrates and which were using carbohydrates more recently produced from photosynthesis.

2012 India blackouts

India had two severe blackouts in July 2012. The "30 July 2012 India blackout" was the then-largest power outage in history, counting number of people affected, beating the January 2001 India blackout. It affected over 300 million people. The "31 July 2012 India blackout" was the largest power outage in history. The outage affected over 620 million people, about 9% of the world population, or half of India's population, spread across 22 states in Northern, Eastern, and Northeast India. An estimated 32 gigawatts of generating capacity was taken offline in the outage. An article in "The Wall Street Journal" stated that of the affected population, 320 million initially had power, while the rest of the affected population lacked direct access.
Electrical power was restored in the affected locations between 31 July and 1 August 2012.
Background.
India is the world's third largest electricity producer and consumer of electricity after US and China, however Indian electrical infrastructure is generally considered unreliable. The northern grid had previously collapsed in 2001. An estimated 27% of energy generated is lost in transmission or stolen, while peak supply falls short of demand by an average of 9%. The nation suffers from frequent power outages that last as long as 10 hours. Further, about 25% of the population, about 300 million people, have no electricity at all. Efforts are underway to reduce transmission and distribution losses and increase production further.
In the summer of 2012, leading up to the failure, extreme heat had caused power use to reach record levels in New Delhi. Due to the late arrival of monsoons, agricultural areas in Punjab and Haryana drew increased power from the grid for running irrigation pumps to paddy fields. The late monsoon also meant that hydropower plants were generating less than their usual production.
Sequence of events.
30 July.
At 02:35 IST (21:05 UTC on 29 July), the 400 kV Bina-Gwalior line tripped. As this line fed into the Agra-Bareilly transmission section, the station also tripped, and power failures cascaded through the grid. All major power stations were shut down in the affected states, causing an estimated shortage of 32 GW. Officials described the failure as "the worst in a decade".
On the day of the collapse, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde stated that the exact cause of the failure was unknown, but that at the time of the failure, electricity use was "above normal". He speculated that some states had attempted to draw more power than permitted due to the higher consumption. Spokesperson for Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and the Northern Regional Load Dispatch Centre (NRLDC) stated that Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana were the states responsible for the overdraw. PGCIL's chairman also stated that electrical service was restored "at a record time".
A senior director for an Indian power company described the outage as "a fairly large breakdown that exposed major technical faults in India’s grid system. Something went terribly wrong which caused the backup safety systems to fail."
More than 300 million people, about 25% of India's population, were without power. Railways and some airports were shut down until 08:00. The busiest airport in North India, Delhi Airport, was able to remain open, because it switched to back-up power in 15 seconds. The outage caused "chaos" for Monday morning rush hour, as passenger trains were shut down and traffic signals were non-operational. Trains stalled for three to five hours. Several hospitals reported interruptions in health services, while others relied on back-up generators. Water treatment plants were shut down for several hours, and millions were unable to draw water from wells powered by electric pumps.
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India stated that the blackout had "severely impacted" businesses, leaving many unable to operate. Oil refineries in Panipat, Mathura and Bhatinda continued operating because they have their own captive power stations within the refineries and do not depend on the grid.
It took 15 hours to restore 80% of service.
31 July.
The system failed again at 13:02 IST (07:32 UTC), due to a relay problem near the Taj Mahal. As a result, power stations across the affected parts of India again went offline. NTPC Ltd. stopped 38% of its generation capacity. Over 600 million people (nearly half of India's population), in 22 out of 28 states in India, were without power.
More than 300 intercity passenger trains and commuter lines were shut down as a result of the power outage. The worst affected zones in the wake of the power grid's collapse were Northern, North Central, East Central, and East Coast railway zones, with parts of Eastern, South Eastern and West Central railway zones. The Delhi Metro suspended service on all six lines, and had to evacuate passengers from trains that stopped mid-journey, helped by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.
About 200 miners were trapped underground in eastern India due to lifts failing, but officials later said they had all been rescued.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), not normally mandated to investigate blackouts, began to do so because of the threat to basic infrastructure facilities like railways, metro rail system, lifts in multi-storey buildings, and movement of vehicular traffic.
The following states were affected by the grid failure:
The following regions were not directly affected by the power outage:
As of 2 August, Uttar Pradesh was being supplied about 7 GW power, while the demand was between 9 and 9.7 GW.
Prior disaster-proofing.
Before the grid collapse, the private sector spent $29 billion to build their own independent power stations in order to provide reliable power to their factories. The five biggest consumers of electricity in India have private off-grid supplies. Indian companies have 35 GW of private off-grid generation capacity and plan to add another 33 GW to their off-grid capacity.
Some villages that were not connected to the grid were not affected, such as Meerwada, Madhya Pradesh which had a 14 kW solar power station built by a US-based firm for $125,000.
Reactions.
On the day of the collapse, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde ordered a three-member panel to determine the reason for the failure and report on it in fifteen days. In response to criticism, he observed that India was not alone in suffering major power outages, as blackouts had also occurred in the United States and Brazil within the previous few years.
The "Washington Post" described the failure as adding urgency to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's plan for a US$400 billion overhaul of India's power grid. His plan calls for a further 76 gigawatts of generation by 2017, produced in part by nuclear power.
Rajiv Kumar, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said, "One of the major reasons for the collapse of the power grid is the major gap between demand and supply. There is an urgent need to reform the power sector and bring about infrastructural improvements to meet the new challenges of the growing economy."
On 1 August 2012, newly appointed Power Minister Moodbidri Veerappa Moily stated, "First thing is to stabilize the grid and it has to sustain. For that we will work out a proper strategy." He declined to blame specific states, saying, "I don't want to start with the blame game."
Team Anna, the supporters of anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare, charged that this grid failure was a conspiracy to suppress the indefinite fast movement started on 25 July 2012 for the Jan Lokpal Bill and targeting Sharad Pawar.
Some technology sources and USAID proposed that another widespread outage could be prevented by integrated network of microgrids and distributed generation connected seamlessly with the main grid via a superior smart grid technology which includes automated fault detection, islanding and self-healing of the network.
Investigation.
The three-member investigation committee consisted of S. C. Srivastava, A. Velayutham and A. S. Bakshi, and issued its report on 16 August 2012. It concluded that four factors were responsible for the two days of blackout:
The committee also offered a number of recommendations to prevent further failures, including an audit of the protection systems.

Insured Network Deposit

The Insured Network Deposits (IND) service is a deposit sweep service for broker-dealers and other custodians of funds. Using the service, broker-dealers automatically transfer, or “sweep,” unused cash balances from customer brokerage accounts to interest-bearing deposit accounts at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and savings associations. The banks may be affiliated or unaffiliated with the broker-dealer.1 
By sweeping funds to multiple banks, broker-dealers that use the IND service offer their customers access to FDIC insurance at multiple banks and, therefore, in larger amounts than the standard FDIC insurance limit for any one bank. Use of a deposit sweep service is an alternative to sweeping funds to money market mutual funds, which are not FDIC insured.2 This service also provides relatively stable floating-rate funding to banks and savings associations.3 
The IND service is provided by Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. In addition to IND, the company offers the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service or CDARS service and the Insured Cash Sweep or ICS service.4 CDARS enables financial institutions to provide access to FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit, and ICS allows financial institutions to provide access to FDIC insurance on balances in money market deposit accounts, both in multiple millions of dollars.5 Promontory Interfinancial Network was founded in 2002 and is based in Arlington, Virginia.6

Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository

The Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository is a deep geological repository for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the first such repository in the world. It is currently under construction at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in the municipality of Eurajoki, on the west coast of Finland, by the company Posiva. It is based on the KBS-3 method of nuclear waste burial developed in Sweden by Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB (SKB).
History.
After the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act
was amended in 1994 to specify that all nuclear waste produced in Finland must be disposed of in Finland, Olkiluoto was selected in 2000 as the site for a (very) long-term underground storage facility for Finland's spent nuclear fuel. The facility, named "Onkalo" (meaning "cave" or "cavity")
is being built in the granite bedrock at the Olkiluoto site, about five km from the power plants. The municipality of Eurajoki issued a building permit for the facility in August 2003 and excavation began in 2004.
Construction.
The facility is being constructed by and will be operated by Posiva, a company owned by the two existing producers of nuclear power in Finland, Fortum and TVO. (Fennovoima, a company which is currently planning its first nuclear reactor, is not a stockholder of Posiva.)
The facility's constructions plans are divided into four phases:
Once in operation, the disposal process would involve putting twelve fuel assemblies into a boron steel canister and enclosing it into a copper capsule. Each capsule would then be placed in its own hole in the repository and packed with bentonite clay. The estimated cost of this project is about €818 million, which includes construction, encapsulation, and operating costs. The State Nuclear Waste Management Fund has saved approximately €1.4 billion from charges for generated electricity.
The Onkalo repository is expected to be large enough to accept for around one hundred years, i.e. until around 2120. At this point, the final encapsulation and burial will take place, and the access tunnel will be backfilled and sealed.
Criticism.
In 2012, a research group at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, published research that suggests that that the copper capsules are not as corrosion safe as the companies planning the repositories claim. See KBS-3.
Treatment in media.
Danish director Michael Madsen has co-written and directed a feature-length documentary "Into Eternity" where the initial phase of the excavation is featured and experts interviewed. The director's special emphasis is on the semantic difficulties in meaningfully marking the depository as dangerous for people in the distant future.

Hyderabad State (1948–56)

[[File:Hyderabad State reorganization 1956.png|thumb|right|Hyderabad state in 1956(in yellowish green). After reorganization in 1956, Regions of the state west of Red and Blue lines merged with Bombay and Mysore states respectively and rest of the state(Telangana) was merged with Andhra state to form Andhra Pradesh state
Hyderabad State was a state in Independent India, formed and existed from 1948 to 1956 after the annexation of Princely state of Hyderabad into Indian Union. The Hyderabad State was later merged with Andhra State in 1956 and named as Andhra Pradesh.
History.
When India gained independence in 1947 and Pakistan came into existence in 1947, the British left the local rulers of the princely states the choice of whether to join one of the new dominions or to remain independent. Nizam of Hyderabad wished Hyderabad to join Pakistan; but this was exceptionally problematic, as the state was entirely surrounded by the new Union of India. Given the Nizam's determination not to join India, this left Hyderabad as an independent country.
At 4 a.m. on 13 September 1948, India's Hyderabad Campaign, code-named "Operation Polo" by the Indian Army, was commenced, with Indian troops invading Hyderabad from all points of the compass. At 5 p.m. on 17 September the Nizam surrendered. India then incorporated the state of Hyderabad into the Union of India and ended the rule of the Nizams. Independent State of Hyderabad became a state of Union of India.
Military Governor.
After the Annexation into the Indian Union, Major General J. N. Chaudhuri who led Operation Polo stayed on as Military Governor till December 1949.
The state witnessed Mulkhi agitation in 1952 by the locals after a government jobs meant for the locals were given to non-locals.
Rajpramukhs.
Hyderabad State had its last Nizam, HEH Mir Osman Ali Khan (b. 1886 -d. 1967) as Rajpramukh from 26 January 1950 to 31 October 1956.
First Appointed Chief Minister.
After the Annexation of Hyderabad State into India, M. K. Vellodi was appointed the Chief Minister of the state on 26 January 1950. He was a Senior Civil servant in the Government of India. He administered the state with the help of bureaucrats from Madras state and Bombay state.
The Nizam was given the ceremonial position of "Raj Pramukh" or "Governor".
First Elected Chief Minister.
In the first State Assembly elections in India, 1952, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected Chief minister of Hyderabad State. During this time there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send back bureaucrats from Madras state, and to strictly implement 'Mulki-rules'(Local jobs for locals only), which was part of Hyderabad state law since 1919.
Districts of Hyderabad State.
Administratively, Hyderabad State was made up of sixteen districts, grouped into four divisions:
Merger with Andhra State.
In 1956 during the Reorganisation of the Indian States based along linguistic lines, the Telugu-speaking region of the state of Hyderabad State was merged with Andhra State. The Marathi speaking region was merged with Bombay state and Kannada speaking region with Mysore state. 
The (SRC) was not in favour of an immediate merger of Telugu speaking Telangana region of Hyderabad state with Andhra state, despite their common language. Para 378 of the SRC report said "One of the principal causes of opposition of Vishalandhra also seems to be the apprehension felt by the educationally backward people of Telangana that they may be swamped and exploited by the more advanced people of the coastal areas."
Andhra state and Hyderabad State were merged to form Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956, after providing safeguards to Telangana in the form of Gentlemen's agreement. But in June 2014, Telangana re-emerged as a separate state. Hyderabad City will continue to be the capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for the coming years.

College Hill Alliance

The mission of the College Hill Alliance is to assist the community in creating change to the physical and social fabric of the College Hill Corridor, a two-square mile area between Mercer University and Macon, Georgia's downtown business district. Funded by a three-year, $2 million grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the College Hill Alliance is a department of Mercer University and became operational in the fall of 2009 after a Senior Capstone project for a group of graduating Mercer students developed into a comprehensive College Hill Corridor Master Plan.
Background.
In 2006, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation sponsored a group of Mercer University students on a trip to meet Richard Florida of the Creative Class Group in Washington, D.C., to learn how they could spur the revival of Downtown Macon, Georgia. These students discovered that Macon was well positioned to recruit and grow creative service industries such as graphic design, marketing, and the arts by retaining talented young people graduating from the city's academic institutions. Inspired by this visit, the group of students dreamed a plan, entitled, "College Hill Revisited," to spur this growth by reconnecting Mercer University and Downtown Macon.
In spring 2007, Mercer University President Bill Underwood and Mayor C. Jack Ellis formed the College Hill Corridor Commission to accomplish the primary goal of creating an attractive, safe and well-defined corridor between Mercer and downtown. By summer, the newly formed Commission began holding public meetings to gather input and momentum from the local community to create a shared vision for the Corridor.
In March 2008, the Commission received a $250,000 planning grant from the Knight Foundation. With the community's input, Interface Studio, an urban planning and design firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was hired to produce the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. During the next year, over 1,000 members of the community met to add their own ideas for the Corridor and set priorities.
In February 2009, the community-driven College Hill Corridor Master Plan was published and adopted by the Commission to begin putting into action.
In June 2009, the Knight Foundation awarded a $5 million grant for revitalizing the College Hill Corridor. The grant issued $3 million to the Community Foundation of Central Georgia to fund the Knight Neighborhood Challenge grant program and $2 million to Mercer University to create the College Hill Alliance.
In September 2012, the Knight Foundation awarded $2.3 million toward continuing the Alliance's work and expanding its influence to assist entrepreneurs in the area.
Alliance.
The mission of the College Hill Alliance is to assist the community in creating positive change to the physical and social fabric of the College Hill Corridor, a two-square mile area between Mercer University and Macon, Georgia's downtown business district.
Created by a three-year, $2 million grant from the Knight Foundation, the College Hill Alliance is a department of Mercer University and became operational in the fall of 2009. In September 2012, the Knight Foundation awarded $2.3 million toward continuing the Alliance's work and expanding its influence to assist entrepreneurs in the area.
The full-time, corporate staff of the Alliance administers the implementation of the College Hill Corridor Master Plan and works specifically to foster neighborhood revitalization through business recruitment and retention, lifestyle enhancement, and by catalyzing commercial and residential real estate development that strengthens the historic character of College Hill.
Commission.
The College Hill Corridor Commission is a diverse group of volunteers committed to promoting an improved physical, cultural and social connection between Downtown Macon and the historic neighborhoods surrounding Mercer University.
Formed in 2007, the Commission shepherded a process that culminated in the College Hill Corridor Master Plan, which represents the best ideas of a talented design firm, local government officials, neighbors, students and even visitors. Having attracted substantial private funding to continue further the College Hill initiative in a more formalized way and with an executive staff, the Commission now supports the College Hill Alliance in an advisory and volunteer capacity.
Commission members are named by virtue of their positions in stakeholder organizations within the Corridor and Downtown Macon and serve as advisors to the Knight Neighborhood Challenge as well as through task forces focused on priorities within the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. The co-chairs of the Commission, appointed by the Mayor of Macon and President of Mercer University, also sit on the College Hill Alliance Steering Committee.
All Commission meetings are open to the public and posted to the College Hill Events Calendar. Community feedback is welcomed and appreciated.
Corridor.
The College Hill Corridor is a two-square mile area between Mercer University and Macon, Georgia's downtown business district comprising several historic city neighborhoods. The cherished area of town is more than a location – it's a movement. What began as a Senior Capstone project for a group of graduating Mercer students developed into a comprehensive College Hill Corridor Master Plan, where public input was compiled to utilize the Corridor as a destination that improves the connection between Mercer University and Downtown Macon.
Today, the College Hill Corridor is a master plan in daily action. The revitalization of the Corridor continues thanks to the efforts of local residents and organizations, including the volunteer-driven College Hill Corridor Commission as well as the Knight Neighborhood Challenge and College Hill Alliance, which are both funded by the Knight Foundation.
Master Plan.
Developed by Philadelphia-based Interface Studio after numerous public meetings to gather community input, the orignal College Hill Corridor Master Plan concentrates on five areas that makes living in the Corridor like no other community in Macon.
With regular, cool events enhancing the area’s Vibe; greenspace and eco-conscious initiatives that improve the Environment; cycling and pedestrian efforts to cool the streets and meet the multi-modal goals of the Connection; residential and business developments targeting the College Hill's Look as Macon’s urban and historic center; and, initiatives and projects dedicated to the Basics of creating a place that is clean, safe and branded, College Hill is an ideal area to live, work, learn, dine, shop and play.
New recommendations for the College Hill Corridor Master Plan, based on community input compiled over a series of public meetings in early 2014, were revealed at the Report to the Community 2014. Among the recommendations is the addition of two new themes: the Strong and the Biz. The Strong seeks to promote exercise, nutrition, access to healthy, affordable food and preventative care. The Biz is about job creation, fostering entrepreneurship and economic development. Other key recommendations were made to the original five parts of the Master Plan: the Basics, the Vibe, the Environment, the Connection and the Look. It was also recommended that the map of the College Hill Corridor extend to create a terminus at Riverside Cemetery and Rose Hill Cemetery.
Projects.
Neighborhood Revitalization.
The goal of the College Hill Corridor, located in these parameters, is to create a cultural and physical connection between Mercer University and downtown Macon. The Corridor tries to add economic value to the city's tax base, keep residential and commercial areas clean to attract and retain students and young professionals. The Corridor creates programs and events, such as Second Sunday, to bring the community together and promote local businesses, bands, fund raisers, and much more. Public input was compiled to utilize the Corridor as a destination that improves the connection between Mercer University and Downtown Macon. The Lights on Macon Tour and Sidewalk Stories are several of the initiatives taking place in The Corridor to boost the local economy and improve the quality of the town.
College Hill Alliance works with the Historic Macon Foundation and Beall's Neighborhood Association to promote living in the Corridor. There are homes to fit every lifestyle and budget, from $60,000 rehabbed loft-style shotgun houses to fully restored $1 million mansions, all in the same block.
Knight Neighborhood Challenge.
When the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $5 million to the revitalization of the College Hill Corridor, $3 million was set aside for the Knight Neighborhood Challenge. Administered by the Community Foundation of Central Georgia, the Knight Neighborhood Challenge is a five-year program that underwrites ideas to transform the city of Macon's first neighborhoods into the vision of the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. A broad-based, competitive grant program, the Challenge funds projects that spruce up parks and public spaces in The Corridor. It also funds enhancements of the arts and entertainment scene. The effort aims to get people involved in College Hill through an array of civic and cultural projects. The goal of the Knight Neighborhood Challenge is to invest in ideas to restore the land use and social fabric of the College Hill neighborhood, to give the city an opportunity to actively participate in a wide array of community arts, cultural and sports activities, and to connect through digital and traditional information gathering/sharing channels.
Second Sunday.
Second Sunday Concerts are one of College Hill Corridor's signature events. Every second Sunday of the month, from April through October, the Corridor hosts the city's biggest monthly picnic in Macon, featuring live music in Washington Park from 6 - 8pm. The concerts are free to attend and features a cash bar, food vendors, and the Macon Makers.
Magnolia Street Soapbox Derby.
For the past 6 years, the Magnolia Street Soapbox Derby is hosted by the Magnolia Street residents and takes place the Saturday before the Second Sunday concert in April. The timed racing event takes place on Magnolia Street’s hill and has teams compete for the title of fastest car and most creative structure. Local business sponsor this annual event. The event is free to attend but a registration fee is required for participants.
Sundown Screen Series.
The College Hill Alliance's need for the creation of sustainable events is being met by different public and private entities. Big Screen on the Green was one of the original Corridor events. Now, the event has transformed into the Sundown Screen Series. 
The Series brings the silver screen to the great outdoors and is hosted by Macon-Bibb Parks & Recreation. These free, outdoor movie events take place in spring, summer and fall at various parks in the city and the Corridor. Picnic baskets and blankets are encouraged, concessions will be availbe at some sites and some events, but not all. In the event of rain, movies will be cancelled. For more information call (478) 751-9280. Funding for the Sundown Screen Series has been made possible by the Knight Foundation.
Reunion Zero.
The Alliance and Mercer University's Alumni Services department partnered together to celebrate the graduating seniors of Mercer University. The communities of Mercer and Macon come together during the week immediately following the last week of the academic calendar to throw a celebration. The week features concerts, downtown get-arounds, specials and discounts at businesses, tours, information about Macon, and career guidance from young alumni. During the week, connections form between the young alumni, Macon community, and recent graduates.
Campus Macon.
Currently in the development stage, the College Hill Alliance is actively exploring ideas to connect local college students to internship and job opportunities in central Georgia. The project is scheduled for completion in late 2014.
The Next Big Idea.
The College Hill Alliance encourages the entrepreneurial spirit among residents of central Georgia. Following that mindset, a business plan competition was created. The Next Big Idea was designed to encourage the to encourage students in the Central Georgia region to make their business dreams a reality, was created. All students at the following colleges were eligible to apply: Central Georgia Technical College, Fort Valley State University, Georgia College, Mercer University, Middle Georgia State College, & Wesleyan College.
Teams submitted their ideas online and each school choose up to two semi-finalist teams. At the end, they competed by pitching their idea to a panel of judges. Teams were judged in the following areas: risk, strategy, capability, viability, and impact. $15,000 was given away as prize money to the top three teams.
Macon Makers.
The College Hill Alliance launched an open call for people to join the "Maker Movement" – a growing national network of artists, craftspeople, business owners, entrepreneurs and innovators building new, locally-driven economies. The Maker Movement is the approximately 135 million adults – 57 percent of the American population ages 18 and up – who employ their creative skills in craft activities, such as making clothing, jewelry, baked goods or art. Financial estimates show that these “makers” push $29 billion into the economy each year. Examples of makers range from computer programmers to wood workers and run the gamut of arts and crafts to engineering and technology. 
The College Hill Alliance is seeking Macon Makers as part of its expanded focus to boost entrepreneurship and attract homegrown businesses to Macon’s Downtown and College Hill Corridor.

<doc id="36589053" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36589053" title="Eolydekkerina">
Eolydekkerina

Eolydekkerina is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian from the Early Triassic of South Africa. It belongs to the family Lydekkerinidae, along with the closely related genus "Lydekkerina". It is known from a single type species, "Eolydekkerina magna", which was named in 1996 from a part of the Beaufort Group called the "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone.
Description.
"Eolydekkerina" is known from two specimens: a skull lacking the lower jaws and a poorly lower jaw, not associated with the skull. At in length, the skull of "Eolydekkerina" is larger than that of any "Lydekkerina" specimen. The snout is proportionally much longer, and the eye sockets are placed farther apart than they are in "Lydekkerina". The proportions of the skull in "Eolydekkerina" are similar to those of the Australian lydekkerinid genus "Chomatobatrachus". However, "Eolydekkerina" shares more features in common with "Lydekkerina", including the nearly identical shape of bones at the back of the skull. The skull is roughly triangular in shape when viewed from above, with straight side margins. The margins of the eye socket are raised and the middle of the snout is slightly indented. Shallow grooves run along the surface of the skull behind the eye sockets and below the nostril openings.
The lengthened skull of "Eolydekkerina", while different from that of "Lydekkerina", is similar to those of the related rhinesuchids and capitosaurians. The short skull of "Lydekkerina" is thought to be a derived or advanced characteristic, suggesting that "Lydekkerina" evolved from a more typical longer-skulled temnospondyl. Since temnospondyl skulls tend to lengthen as individuals of a species age, the skull of "Lydekkerina" may represent a juvenile form, while the skull of "Eolydekkerina" represents a fully-grown adult form. If "Lydekkerina" is the descendant of "Eolydekkerina", it likely evolved by retaining juvenile characteristics into adulthood in a condition known as paedomorphosis.
Paleoenvironment.
Remains of "Eolydekkerina" were found in the lower part of the "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone, a deposit that preserves very few amphibians. Amphibians become more numerous in younger parts of the "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone with most specimens attributable to either "Lydekkerina" or to the dissorophoid "Micropholis". Several species of the family Rhytidosteidae have also been identified from the upper part of the "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone. When fossils of "Eolydekkerina" were first found, they were thought to belong to a rhytidosteid, as a rhytidosteid called "Pneumatostega" had already been found in this part of the assemblage zone.
The lower "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone is dominated by the synapsid "Lystrosaurus", as well as reptiles such as "Owenetta" and "Proterosuchus". Most small-bodied lydekkerinids such as "Lydekkerina" are found in this type of assemblage. Lydekkerinids of similar size to "Eolydekkerina" (such as "Chomatobatrachus") are usually found in amphibian-dominated assemblages where "Lystrosaurus" is not present. Therefore, the presence of "Eolydekkerina" in a reptile-dominated environment is unusual.

The Nightingale casting controversy

In 2012, the La Jolla Playhouse generated nationwide controversy for the casting of a musical adaptation of a Hans Christian Andersen story "The Nightingale," set in ancient China. The play was part of the La Jolla Playhouse's "Page to Stage" program, a workshop series in which unfinished new works are tested and altered during the show's run. Only two Asian American actors were cast, and more than half the cast were Caucasian actors. The Asian American Theatre Community expressed their indignity on this issue.
The casting controversy generated significant response from the Asian American theater and artistic community, particularly because similar controversies have occurred in the past, as when Jonathan Pryce was cast to play the Eurasian lead in the musical, "Miss Saigon".
During a public forum to address the debate, the idea for which having been generated by a letter of protest from the Asian American Performers' Action Coalition, Christopher Ashley, the current Artistic Director of the La Jolla Playhouse, stated that it was his effort to follow a "color-blind" casting principle for this play, and to incorporate both western and eastern elements.[https://vimeo.com/46243248] Ashley and director Moises Kaufman both apologized. Kaufman admitted that he would be "the first to agree that we have been unsuccessful at what we were trying to do."
Speaking from the audience, book writer Steven Sater stated that even though they started out with an all-Asian cast, they eventually decided to go with a multi-cultural cast in order to reflect the "multi-ethnic" world that he knew and lived in. Composer Duncan Sheik stated in an interview after the panel that the discussion had "affected" his thinking of the show and that his "head spinning." Previous readings of the musical included one at Vassar's Powerhouse Theater with a multi-ethnic cast (also directed by Kaufman), as well as one with an Asian American cast at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco.

Lee Tunnel

The Lee Tunnel is a tunnel for storage and conveyance of sewage mixed with rainwater. The tunnel is part of the Thames Tideway Scheme and runs from Abbey Mills Pumping Station down to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works under the London Borough of Newham.
This long tunnel, diameter , running from deep at Abbey Mills down to deep at Beckton, will capture , or 16 million tonnes, of sewage annually from the single largest polluting CSO in London. This sewage would otherwise flow straight into the River Lea, the Thames Tideway and eventually the Thames Estuary. However, the sewage will now be pumped up to the Beckton Sewage Treatment Works - the largest sewage treatment works in Europe - and the resultant clean water will be emptied into the River Lea. The reason for starting at -75m is to be ready to collect sewage from the lowest point of the Thames Tideway Tunnel, which is yet to be built but is intended to connect.
Thames Water awarded the construction contract to the MVB JV consortium, comprising Morgan Sindall, VINCI Construction Grands Projets and Bachy Soletanche, in January 2010. The cost is an estimated £635 million.
The construction of the tunnel began with sinking of vertical shafts in 2010. In February 2012, the TBM, built by Herrenknecht and named Busy Lizzie, started work at the Beckton end. In 2013, a UK record concrete slipform pour was achieved, with 29 days of continual pouring. The tunnel is the deepest tunnel ever bored in London, exceeding the Crossrail excavations. The TBM reached Abbey Mills in January 2014. The remaining work is expected to be completed during 2015-16.

ViPS Viipuri

Viipurin Palloseura (abbreviated as ViPS; 'Viipuri Ball Club') was mainly a bandy club from Vyborg, Russia (which in Finnish is called "Viipuri"), founded in 1928 when the town belonged to Finland. The sport came to Finland from St. Petersburg, Russia, and it was natural that it gained a strong foothold in near-by Viipuri.
During the Winter War (1939–40), the population of Viipuri was evacuated, and in the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty the city was ceded to the Soviet Union. As a result of this, the club was in effect dissolved. A new bandy club called Hukat was formed in Helsinki, its players consisting mostly of former ViPS players.
Sporting achievements.
ViPS won the Finnish championship in bandy in 1931 and 1936, silver in 1934, and bronze in 1932 and 1933.
In association football ViPS played for two seasons, in 1930–31, in the Mestaruussarja, i.e. ‘Championship Series’, the top flight of Finnish football.
In ice hockey the club made it to the semifinals in the season 1928–29.

Janine Berger

Janine Berger (born 21 April 1996) is a German artistic gymnast. In 2012 she began competing among seniors and was selected for the 2012 Summer Olympics, where her team was placed ninth.
Individually she competed in the vault, uneven bar and floor exercise, but failed to reach the finals in the last two events. In the vault she performed a Rudi (handspring 1.5 twisting layout) and a double twisting Tsukahara, with difficulty ratings of 6.3 and 6.0, respectively. Her first vault, the Rudi, had a good height and amplitude, but excessive piking of the hips in the final phase led to an uncontrolled landing. Janine finished fourth behind Russia's Maria Paseka. 
In early 2014, she returned to Gymnastics after a years break in 2013 following an injury. She won the vault competition at the Turnier De Meister World Cup in Cottbus, Germany.

Tigoni Conventual Priory

Prince of Peace Conventual Priory, Tigoni, Nairobi Province, Kenya, is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of the Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. Established in 1978 at the request of Maurice Cardinal Otunga, the monastery is currently home to 35 monks. Conventual Prior Lawrence Mukuru Emukule is the community's superior.
History.
From Peramiho to Kenya.
From its foundation in 1898, the community of Missionary Benedictines at Peramiho, Tanzania, had sought to evangelize the surrounding population. During the monastery's period as an abbatia nullius, its monks successfully cultivated local vocations to the priesthood. In 1969, Diocese of Songea was created and a local priest ordained bishop. At this point, the monks of Peramiho found themselves at a crossroads. Their duty of primary evangelization had been largely accomplished; now it was time to focus mission efforts elsewhere.
Bishop Emilio Njiru of Eldoret, Kenya, invited the monks of Peramiho Abbey to settle in the northern part of his diocese, in the Kerio Valley, an area that had seen little mission work. The Congregation's 11th General Chapter, meeting in 1971, gave their approval to this idea. The first Missionary Benedictines arrived in the Diocese of Eldoret on February 10, 1972. Soon, they began evangelizing the Pokot and Marakwet, residents of the Kerio Valley. Reflecting previous mission efforts of the Congregation, religious instruction was accompanied by social, educational, and medical services. 
The popularity of the Benedictines spread, and in 1977, Maurice Cardinal Otunga of Nairobi invited the monks to make a foundation in the capital city. The monks of Peramiho Abbey were to build a parish in the northern suburbs of Nairobi, including the slums of the Mathare Valley. It was also decided that local vocations would be recruited as soon as the facilities (which were to include a monastery, retreat center, and Christian education center) had been constructed.
Consolidating the Foundation.
The foundation in Nairobi, St Benedict's Monastery, opened on April 6, 1978. In early 1979, construction of the monastery itself began, designed to house a community of 16 monks. At this time, the community began to accept candidates. To ensure that the monastic quality of the house was not overshadowed by the mission apostolate, the Congregation raised the foundation to the status of a simple priory on June 22, 1979. A retreat house and a church were completed in 1982.
Local vocations arrived quickly. A formation house had been established in Nanyuki, 200 km north of Nairobi. By 1981, four local monks had pronounced their vows. By 1984, ten postulants were in formation. Neighboring Uganda proved to be a ready source of vocations. However, the existence of a separate formation house ended up being a disadvantage. Not only did its administration require extra personnel, it also made consolidation of the quickly growing monastic community a challenge. The goal of having a midsized monastery was not being realized either at the Nanyuki formation house or at the Nairobi monastery. In 1988, St Benedict's Monastery in Nairobi was raised to the status of a conventual priory, and Pius Mühlbacher became the community's first conventual prior.
To solve this problem, Cardinal Otunga offered the Missionary Benedictines a large farm in Tigoni, 30 km northwest of Nairobi. In 1987, construction of a new monastery here began; the official day of Tigoni's founding is November 20, 1987. By 1990, quarters for 24 monks had been built. Cardinal Otunga consecrated the monastery's church in 1991. The monastery's properties in Nairobi and Nanyuki were converted to domus religiosa, and the monastic community transferred to Tigoni on June 30, 1992.
Personnel.
As of May 18, 2011, 26 solemnly professed monks (13 of them priests) resided at Tigoni. At this time, the community also included nine temporally professed monks.
Conventual Prior Fr Lawrence Mukuru Emukule is the current superior of the monastic community. He was confirmed for a six-year term on January 15, 2006. Prior Lawrence is assisted in his duties by Bro Emmanuel Omamo (subprior).

Anne Ewing

Anne Ewing (November 19, 1930 - April 11, 2011) was an American biologist and activist for women's rights. She is known for her advocacy for women's rights and her role in removing racist and sexist language from primary school readers in California.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Anne Ewing was born Ann Drayton Heuser on November 19, 1930 in the upstairs bedroom of her family's home located in Wytheville, Virginia. Born "blue", the attending doctor asked her father for a bit of liquor from his hip flask to revive the baby. It worked. As a youngster, Ewing was taken care of by and had much affection for Josie Williams, who worked in the family's home; and by her grandfather, Henry Massillon Heuser, commonly known as "The Judge" since he was the judge for the community. She graduated from Wytheville High School on June 6, 1947; she was the senior class's Vice-President. She matriculated to Marion Junior College the following year, where she distinguished herself in basketball and in field hockey. Then she went on to the College of William and Mary to finish her Bachelor's degree in Biology in 1951. Her first desire was for a degree in chemistry, but the head of the department would not graduate a female student, so she switched to biology.
Next, Ewing earned a Master's degree in Botany from the University of Tennessee in 1952. She then continued her graduate studies at Michigan State University, East Lansing, working toward a Ph.D. in Botany. Afterwards, she taught at University of North Carolina, Greensboro; University of North Carolina, Raleigh; and at Pennsylvania State University, State College.
In 1957, Ewing married Robert Radlow and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. The family moved to San Diego, California, in 1968; the couple divorced in 1980. At that time, she legally changed her name to Anne Dungan Ewing, taking her children's middle names to make a new name for herself.
Ewing died on April 11, 2011 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder at the age of 80 in her home in San Diego, California Per her request, in lieu of flowers at her memorial on May 1, 2011, donations in her memory were given to Planned Parenthood of San Diego. 
Career as a biologist.
Ewing worked as a research fellow for three years (1972-1975) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, designing and conducting research to understand salt-tolerance in plants. Later, she worked in the Planning and Land Use Office of the County of San Diego (1975-1995). Ewing worked to protect numerous native plants and animals from losing their homes to development projects. She also was a lead planner for the Otay Ranch section of Chula Vista, California. Additionally, she was an active member of the Torrey Pines Association, a non-profit organization that encourages public interest in the preservation of the Torrey pine tree and its habitat.
Career as an activist.
Ewing began her activism as a college student and participated in the civil rights movement in the segregated south. After moving to San Diego, she became involved with women’s rights issues. In the early 1970s, she joined the San Diego County Chapter of NOW, the National Organization for Women, and began working on the Education Task Force. As part of that organization, she worked hard in support of Title IX, an amendment to the 1965 Higher Education Act securing equal access to educational programs -- including sports programs -- regardless of sex, until its passage in 1972. She then began to agitate for the elimination of sexist and racist readers in the primary schools. As a part of that effort, Ewing served as the chair of California NOW's Education Task Force. On June 7, 1974, she wrote a guest editorial in "The San Diego Union" newspaper entitled, "Are California's textbooks fair to Jane?: Stereotypes Remain In Latest Materials." Under Ewing's leadership, California NOW presented a report to the California State Board of Education that clearly showed that the readers being used in the primary schools contained sexist and racist themes. California NOW requested that the California Education Board remove these readers and replace them with more appropriate texts. When the Board refused, California NOW threatened to sue the California Education Board over their reluctance to change the clearly sexist and racist texts used in the primary schools. Eventually, the California Education Board yielded and banned texts that had obvious sexism and racism, using the criteria developed by Ewing. The new readers removed racist and sexist language and included the contributions of both men and women in all types of roles, including professional, vocational, and executive. Soon after the rest of the nation followed suit. Concurrent with this achievement, in 1974 the U.S. Congress passed the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA) ensuring that elementary and secondary school books for all American children depicted positive roles for all races and sexes.
She also served as the President of the San Diego County Chapter of NOW from 1975-1976. In 1976, she founded the San Diego County Chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus, and served as its President from 1976-1978.
Ewing was also a strong supporter of women's rights to choose an abortion (pro-choice), and worked for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.

Müller was married to Klara (née Hafner) with whom he had two children, son Alan and daughter Evelina. After his father death, Müller inherited "Balkan" cinema and part of residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street. In 1938, because of the political situation and antisemitism caused by Nazi propaganda, Müller and his family converted to Catholicism and change their surname to Miler. In 1939, Müller sold the residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street to a Topić family from Zagreb. That same year Müller and his family moved to France. During World War II, Müller and his wife where arrested by Gestapo in France with the help from Vichy Regime, while their daughter managed to save herself by hiding at friends. Müller son joined the French Resistance. In August 1944, Müller was deported to Dachau concentration camp, where in January 1945 he was killed.

Harry Freeman (music hall performer)

Harry Freeman (29 July 1858 – 30 July 1922), was a music hall performer of the Victorian era and early twentieth century, and the first King Rat of the showbusiness charity the Grand Order of Water Rats. Among his popular songs were 'Leicester Square' and 'The Giddy little Girl said, "No!"'.
Freeman was born near Bromsgrove in Worcestershire in 1858. In his early teens he moved to Birmingham where he was mainly to be based as an entertainer until his death. His first public appearance was aged 19 in 1877 at a 'Free and Easy' at the Imperial Theatre in Walsall. This was such a success that he received bookings at all the main music halls in the Midlands. He made his London debut at 'Lusby's Music Hall' in 1881. Freeman became a popular entertainer in the music halls of London and the provinces, but he never gained the fame or success in these that he held in his native Birmingham. His songs included 'Can't Stop', 'They're After Me', 'It Never Troubles Me', 'The Giddy little Girl said, "No!"', 'They Were All Occupied' and 'Leicester Square'. A popular success was the song 'Wot Cher Trilby', written by Cart Howard following the success of the stage play "Trilby", and which Freeman sang dressed in female attire. 
During the early 1890s Freeman was living in London, and when the Grand Order of Water Rats was formed in 1890 by Joe Elvin and Jack Lotto, music hall star Dan Leno was to have been the first King Rat of the order, but he preferred not to be King for the first year, and the office went instead to Freeman. In 1896 he appeared on the bill at 'The Paragon Theatre of Varieties' on the Mile End Road in London's East End.
Freeman was one of the 231 figures depicted in Walter Lambert's 'Popularity', a vast painting depicting the music hall stars of the early 1900s. His last public appearance was in Norwich in May 1922. 
Harry Freeman died on 30 July 1922 following an abdominal operation in St Peter's Hospital in Covent Garden. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Handsworth in his native Birmingham on 4 August 1922.

Basilea (queen)

Basilea was the first queen of the legendary Kingdom of Atlantis in ancient Greek folk tradition.
Basilea was the eldest and one of the most celebrated daughters of Uranus, who had forty-five children by various wives, including Rhea and Pandora. Basilea became known as the “Great Mother” due to the solicitous way in which she cared for her younger brothers. After her father’s death, she was elected Queen of Atlantis by popular vote. She married her brother Hyperion and had two children: Selene and Helio, the gods of the moon and sun, respectively. However, her other brothers murdered Hyperion, for fear that he might usurp the throne, and drowned Helio in the River Eridanus or Po in Italy. Out of love for her brother, Selene committed suicide by jumping from a rooftop. Upon learning of the death of her children, Basilea went mad and “wandered up and down, with hair disheveled and bedizened with ornaments, playing wildly on the timbrel and cymbal.” When the people of Atlantis tried to restrain her, she disappeared into a terrible lightning storm. In honor of Basilea and her children, divine rites were established. 
Frank Joseph writes that Basilia was the wife of Uranus rather than his daughter. Basilea became mad when her husband and son were assassinated by other Atlantean kings who feared they would establish a dynasty.

Rayleigh–Bénard convection

Rayleigh–Bénard convection is a type of natural convection, occurring in a plane horizontal layer of fluid heated from below, in which the fluid develops a regular pattern of convection cells known as Bénard cells. Rayleigh–Bénard convection is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility. The convection patterns are the most carefully examined example of self-organizing nonlinear systems.
Buoyancy, and hence gravity, is responsible for the appearance of convection cells. The initial movement is the upwelling of lesser density fluid from the heated bottom layer. This upwelling spontaneously organizes into a regular pattern of cells.
Physical processes.
The features of Rayleigh–Bénard convection can be obtained by a simple experiment first conducted by Henri Bénard, a French physicist, in 1900. 
Development of convection.
The experimental set-up uses a layer of liquid, e.g. water, between two parallel planes. The height of the layer is small compared to the horizontal dimension. At first, the temperature of the bottom plane is the same as the top plane. The liquid will then tend towards an equilibrium, where its temperature is the same as its surroundings. (Once there, the liquid is perfectly uniform: to an observer it would appear the same from any position. This equilibrium is also asymptotically stable: after a local, temporary perturbation of the outside temperature, it will go back to its uniform state, in line with the second law of thermodynamics).
Then, the temperature of the bottom plane is increased slightly yielding a flow of thermal energy conducted through the liquid. The system will begin to have a structure of thermal conductivity: the temperature, and the density and pressure with it, will vary linearly between the bottom and top plane. A uniform linear gradient of temperature will be established. (This system may be modelled by statistical mechanics).
Once conduction is established, the microscopic random movement "spontaneously" becomes ordered on a macroscopic level, forming Benard convection cells, with a characteristic correlation length.
Convection features.
The rotation of the cells is stable and will alternate from clock-wise to counter-clockwise horizontally; this is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Bénard cells are metastable. This means that a small perturbation will not be able to change the rotation of the cells, but a larger one could affect the rotation; they exhibit a form of hysteresis.
Moreover, the deterministic law at the microscopic level produces a non-deterministic arrangement of the cells: if the experiment is repeated, a particular position in the experiment will be in a clockwise cell in some cases, and a counter-clockwise cell in others. Microscopic perturbations of the initial conditions are enough to produce a non-deterministic macroscopic effect. That is, in principle, there is no way to calculate the macroscopic effect of a microscopic perturbation. This inability to predict long-range conditions and sensitivity to initial-conditions are characteristics of chaotic or complex systems (i.e., the butterfly effect).
If the temperature of the bottom plane was to be further increased, the structure would become more complex in space and time; the turbulent flow would become chaotic.
Convective Bénard cells tend to approximate regular right hexagonal prisms, particularly in the absence of turbulence, although certain experimental conditions can result in the formation of regular right square prisms or spirals.
The convective Bénard cells are not unique and will usually appear only in the surface tension driven convection. In general the solutions to the Rayleigh and Pearson analysis (linear theory) assuming an infinite horizontal layer gives rise to degeneracy meaning that many patterns may be obtained by the system. Assuming uniform temperature at the top and bottom plates, when a realistic system is used (a layer with horizontal boundaries) the shape of the boundaries will mandate the pattern. More often than not the convection will appear as rolls or a superposition of them.
The Rayleigh–Bénard Instability.
Since there is a density gradient between the top and the bottom plate, gravity acts trying to pull the cooler, denser liquid from the top to the bottom. This gravitational force is opposed by the viscous damping force in the fluid. The balance of these two forces is expressed by a non-dimensional parameter called the Rayleigh number. The Rayleigh Number is defined as:
where
As the Rayleigh number increases, the gravitational forces become more dominant. At a critical Rayleigh number of 1708, the instability sets in, and convection cells appear.
The critical Rayleigh number can be obtained analytically for a number of different boundary conditions by doing a perturbation analysis on the linearized equations in the stable state. The simplest case is that of two free boundaries, which Lord Rayleigh solved in 1916. and obtained "R"c =  π4 ≈ 657.51. In the case of a rigid boundary at the bottom, and a free boundary at the top (which is the situation in a kettle without a lid), the critical Rayleigh number comes out as "R"c = 1,100.65.
Effects of surface tension.
In case of a free liquid surface in contact with air, buoyancy and surface tension effects will also play a role in how the convection patterns develop. Liquids flow from places of lower surface tension to places of higher surface tension. This is called the Marangoni effect. When applying heat from below, the temperature at the top layer will show temperature fluctuations. With increasing temperature, surface tension decreases. Thus a lateral flow of liquid at the surface will take place, from warmer areas to cooler areas. In order to preserve a horizontal (or nearly horizontal) liquid surface, cooler surface liquid will descend. This down-welling of cooler liquid contributes to the driving force of the convection cells. The specific case of temperature gradient-driven surface tension variations is known as thermo-capillary convection, or Bénard–Marangoni convection.
History and nomenclature.
Rayleigh–Bénard convection, whose effects are due solely to a temperature gradient, was first successfully analyzed by Lord Rayleigh; Rayleigh assumed boundary conditions in which the vertical velocity component and temperature disturbance vanish at the top and bottom boundaries (perfect thermal conduction). Those assumptions resulted in the analysis losing any connection with Henri Bénard's experiment. This resulted in discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results until Pearson reworked the problem based on surface tension. This is what was originally observed by Bénard. Nonetheless in modern usage "Rayleigh–Bénard convection" refers to the effects due to temperature, whereas "Bénard–Marangoni convection" refers specifically to the effects of surface tension. Davis and Koschmieder have suggested that the convection should be rightfully called the "Pearson–Bénard convection".
Rayleigh–Bénard convection is also sometimes known as "Bénard–Rayleigh convection", "Bénard convection", or "Rayleigh convection".

Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs

Orlando Tobias Edward Higginbottom (born 7 March 1986), better known by his stage name Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, is a British electronic music producer, DJ and singer based in London.
Early years.
Orlando is the son of Professor Edward Higginbottom, conductor of the choir of New College, University of Oxford. He was educated at the Cherwell School, Oxford. A classically trained musician, he attended the Junior Royal Academy Of Music in London. Orlando began listening to electronic music in his early teens, through borrowing audio tapes from his older siblings.
After buying records and DJing since the age of 13, and experimenting with music production for several years, Orlando launched Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs in 2009. The name was intended to oppose the often pretentious world of dance music and underground cool, and together with his stage persona, inject some fun and colour into the club environment.
Orlando commented to Spin Magazine that he was looking for a name that "couldn't be cool, couldn't be put into some kind of scene that gets hip for six months and then falls out of fashion."
 In tandem with the name he conceived a stage show which involved dressing up as a dinosaur himself flanked by similarly dressed dancers.
2009 – 2011: Greco-Roman & Kinshasa One Two.
TEED made his debut on Joe Goddard's Greco-Roman label in 2009 with the “All In One Sixty Dancehalls” EP, featuring a remix by British producers 2 Bad Mice. This was followed “All In Two Sixty Dancehalls” EP (featuring the single 'Garden') and by 'Household Goods' EP in November 2010.
In July 2011 Orlando was enlisted by Blur frontman Damon Albarn to take part in an album project connected with his work for well-known charity Oxfam. “Kinshasa One Two” was recorded over a period of six days in the Democratic Republic Of Congo (DRC) as part of the Oxjam music series and released on Warp Records in that year.
2012: Trouble LP.
On 11 June 2012 TEED's debut album “Trouble” was released by Polydor Records. The album was well received, with favourable reviews from several well-respected music publications including the NME ("One of the UK’s most exciting young producers"), Pitchfork and the BBC. iTunes UK named 'Trouble' as their 'Debut Electronic album of the year', it was DJ Magazine's 'album of the year' and it was number 5 in the BBC's end of year album poll.
'Trouble' was also voted 'Best Album' in DJ Magazine's Best of British 2012, with TEED also picking up the award for 'Best Live Act'.
TEED released a number of singles/EPs from the album besides the single “Garden”. These include “Trouble”, “Tapes and Money”, “Household Goods”, "You Need Me On My Own" and “Stronger/American Dream Part II”, which was released as a double single.
TEED appears in the music video for the single, "Trouble". The video was shot in Los Angeles, CA during May 2011 and directed by The General Assembly.
That same year he was enlisted by Pete Tong to record an Essential Mix, which was broadcast on his seminal Friday night show on 18 August 2012.
2013: Get Lost VI.
On 8 July 2013 Crosstown Rebels released “Get Lost VI”, a compilation of music curated and mixed by Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs.
“Get Lost VI” featured tracks from Underground Resistance, Tiga, Breach, Trus'me, Axel Boman, Dave Aju, Mathew Jonson and more.
It was voted 'Best Compilation' in DJ Magazine's Best of British 2013.
It also featured a collaboration by TEED and Eats Everything entitled “Lion, The Lion”, which was later released as a single with remixes by Dutch producer Gerd.
Live Show & Beyond.
TEED has also produced music for other artists including BBC Sound Of 2014 nominee, Banks. He has composed two songs with the American artist, “Warm Water” and “Bedroom Wall”. He has also provided feature vocals for Dillon Francis on “Without You”.
TEED has remixed a number of artists (see Discography), most recently Disclosure's 'F For You' and Foals 'My Number'.
TEED has also presented shows on 6 Music and Rinse FM as well as performing live at Maida Vale Studios for Rob Da Bank's Radio 1 show and has made several appearances on the Boiler Room, including a back-to-back session with Friendly Fires.
TEED's 'Trouble' era live show combined visual and audio elements. He was notorious for his flamboyant headdresses and bright coloured handmade stage outfits and was usually accompanied by dancers. He has toured the globe extensively, with headline appearances at many of the world's best-known festivals, including Glastonbury, Lollapalooza, Parklife, Secret Garden Party, Sonar, Amsterdam Dance Event and more.
TEED's live show has currently been placed on hold while he focuses on DJing and recording a new album.

Müller was married to Nada (née Spitzer) with whom he had three sons, Marijan, Rajko and Branko. Müller fought in World War I as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was a member of the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, Müller, his brother and their families converted to Catholicism and change their surname to Miler due to political situation and antisemitism caused by Nazi propaganda. In 1939, with his wife and two sons Müller moved to London, while his youngest son Branko stayed in Zagreb with his governess. At the beginning of World War II, Müller returned to Zagreb for his son. Müller arranged that his son and governess move to Kosovska Mitrovica where he had a mine. Müller refused to believe that like other Jews he will be arrested and deported to concentration camp. Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac urged Ante Pavelić to save Müller, but in November, 1941 Müller was killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp. After the war Müller's wife returned to Zagreb and sought the return of the Müller's family seized property, but without success. His eldest son, Marijan, made Aliyah to Israel in 1940s. Müller two other sons, Rajko and Branko stayed in Zagreb with their mother. Both of them were skilled athletes. After graduation at the Faculty of Kinesiology at the University of Zagreb, Branko Müller moved to Freiburg where he worked as a professor of athletics.

Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac &amp; Fox Nation

Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.
The Sac and Fox Nation is an Indian (Native American) tribe that governs itself under the Indian Self-Determination Act and imposes taxes based on that authority. The State of Oklahoma sought to impose income and motor vehicle taxes on tribal members. The tribe brought suit to prevent the state from imposing those taxes.
Both the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court held that Oklahoma, without a clear authorization from Congress, was prohibited from imposing taxes on tribal members in Indian country. This case, together with several other cases, are known as the "Oklahoma tax cases" in Native American case law.
Background.
History.
The Sac and Fox Nation is an Indian tribe originally from the Great Lakes area. Following a series of treaties with the United States, in 1867 they moved to the Sac and Fox reservation of in Indian Territory (in what is now Pottawatomie County in the State of Oklahoma). In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act which broke up the reservation and allotted land to the tribal members. In implementing this law, the United States entered into another treaty with the tribe in 1891, in which the tribe retained as a tribal headquarters and tribal members were allotted of land from the former reservation.
The Sac and Fox Nation governs itself under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination Act and has its own tax commission. The tribe imposes a tax on earnings of any person working within tribal jurisdiction, regardless of whether that person is a tribal member. The tribe also provides for a motor vehicle tax and registration of any vehicle that are owned by a tribal member and garaged within tribal jurisdiction. The State of Oklahoma, through the Oklahoma Tax Commission, also administers income and motor vehicle taxes. The state considers that all income earned in the state is taxable, including on tribal land, and issues tax assessments against those who are delinquent. Oklahoma contends that anyone within the state had to register their vehicles with the state, while the Sac and Fox Nation required tribal members residing in tribal jurisdiction to register the vehicle with the tribe. The state viewed those members to be delinquent in their vehicle taxes, but made no effort to collect until the vehicle was sold to a new owner. At that time, Oklahoma would require that the delinquent taxes and penalties be paid in order to register the vehicle.

The Sac and Fox Nation then filed a lawsuit against the Oklahoma Tax Commission in U.S. District Court seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the state from taxing income earned within tribal jurisdiction or of those who reside within the tribe's jurisdiction, and from vehicle taxes on vehicles that were lawfully registered with the tribe. Both the Sac and Fox Nation and Oklahoma made motions for summary judgment and the district court, without determining reservation boundaries, held that while the state could collect income tax on non-tribal members, they could not collect income taxes from tribal members employed by the tribe on trust land. The district court also held that the state could not collect vehicle taxes for periods that the vehicle was properly registered with the tribe. Both sides appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Tenth Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the district court. First the court noted that the reservation boundaries were not relevant to the case, the issue instead being tribal immunity from state jurisdiction. The court noted the prior Supreme Court decision in "Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band, Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla." and stated that "It appears as though the State of Oklahoma persists in fighting a battle it has already lost." Since Oklahoman could provide no Congressional authority for collecting taxes from Sac and Fox tribal members it was clear that the state had exceeded its authority. On the income tax for non-tribal employees, the Sac and Fox Nation asserted that the Commerce Clause and treaty language granted it exclusive taxing authority on tribal land. The appellate court was not persuaded and ruled that the state could impose an income tax on non-tribal members.
On the issue of tribal motor vehicle taxes and registration, the Tenth Circuit Court did not make a distinction between tribal and non-tribal members. The court held that the tribe could require the registration of vehicles on tribal land, regardless of whether the owner was a tribal member or not. The court noted that both "Moe v. Salish and Kootenai Tribes" and "Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation" prohibit such state taxation on tribal members. The state could enforce its vehicle tax on non-tribal members.
Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court, which, after noting a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision in the same area, granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case.
Opinion of the court.
Arguments.
David Allen Miley argued the case for Oklahoma. Edwin Kneedler argued the case for the United States as "amicus curiae" on behalf of the tribe, with Solicitor General Ken Starr. G. William Rice argued the case for the Sac and Fox Nation. "Amicus curiae" briefs in support of Oklahoma were filed by Arizona, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Briefs in support of the tribe were filed by Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and Navajo Nation.
The state argued that the case law cited by the Tenth Circuit only dealt with established Indian reservations and that the appellate court erred since the Sac and Fox reservation had been disestablished in the 1890s. The Tax Commission's position was that there were no more reservations in Oklahoma. Oklahoma stated that without determining reservation boundaries, if any, the lower court would be unable to properly apply tribal immunity. The state also argued that the vehicle tax and registration fees were more akin to a sales tax and a use fee than an excise tax.
Opinion.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. O'Connor stated that Oklahoma's argument that a tribal member must live on a reservation to be exempt from state taxes was incorrect. All that is required is that the member live in "Indian country", which Congress has defined to "include formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or held in trust by the United States." O'Connor noted that the Tenth Circuit should have determined the residence of the tribal members as inside or outside of Indian country, not if they were within the reservation. She noted that in "Potawatomi" case, Oklahoma made exactly the same argument which was also rejected by the court.
O'Connor also rejected the state's argument that the motor vehicle tax was not an excise tax and that the registration fee was a use fee. She stated that the tax strongly resembled the taxes prohibited by "Colville" and "Moe", and noted that if the registration fee was a use fee, then non-residents of Oklahoma would not be exempt. The court upheld the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.
Subsequent developments.
This case, together with two other involving the Oklahoma Tax Commission have defined tribal sovereignty in a clearer manner. The case has been cited in numerous lower court opinions, as well as the Supreme Courts own opinions, as limiting the ability of state governments to act in Indian country. "Sac and Fox", together with "Potawatomi" and "Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation", have become known as the "Oklahoma tax cases". The decision is also unique in that it uses a federal criminal jurisdiction statute as the basis for civil jurisdiction.

Meet the Neighbors

"Pilot" or "Meet the Neighbors" is the pilot episode of the American television science fiction sitcom "The Neighbors". It is slated to air on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on September 26, 2012. The episode was written by Dan Fogelman, and directed by Chris Koch. The episode has generally received negative reviews.
The concept of "The Neighbors" was devised by Fogelman, who previously wrote the films "Cars", "Cars 2" and "Tangled". Although it is a comedy series, its script was cited as potentially being too complex for mainstream American television. Fogelman cenceived "The Neighbors" after a visit to his mother's gated community.
Production.
Conception.
Dan Fogelman devised the concept of the series, which was previously entitled "Down to Earth". It was described as a sitcom about "a New Jersey family that moves into a gated community occupied exclusively by extraterrestrials." Fogelman previously wrote the films "Cars", "Cars 2" and "Tangled". The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) picked up the pilot episode of "The Neighbors" in October 2011, with a pilot commitment. Chris Koch signed on to directed the pilot episode. The show was originally produced for ABC Studios and Warner Bros. Television, but Warner Bros. Television was replaced by company Kaplan Entertainment. Dan Fogelman, Chris Koch, Jeff Morton and Aaron Kaplan executive produced the episode. In May 2012, the show renamed to "The Neighbors", and production of the program was green-lit. "Pilot" was written by Fogelman.
Fogelman conceived "The Neighbors" after visiting his mother, who lived in a gated townhouse community, and stated, "you could reach out my mom's bathroom window and touch her neighbor's bathroom window", but they never spoke to or knew each other, and the idea was "who are these people that she's living between?", and what if they were all aliens? He claimed that family is the best part of humanity, and he kept "exploring stuff". Fogelman wants "The Neighbors" to be a show that "the whole family can watch together". He said: "It's high concept but I do want to ground it as a family sitcom".
The show's premise has been described as "goofy", and has been considered as a "high-concept" show by "Entertainment Weekly". At the semi-annual press tour in Beverly Hills, ABC Entertainment President Paul Lee stated that "The Neighbors" has "high-concept nature", but "loveit. "The Neighbors" was originally stated to premiere at 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but ABC decided to air it in 8:30 time interval. In response to this, Lee claimed that "8:30 p.m. suited the show better" as "there's so much pressure [to perform after "Modern Family"". The 9:30 p.m. slot was replaced with "Suburgatory". Lee wants it to be on the air for a long time, and claimed that "Suburgatory" would better fit in the 9:30 slot. Lee praised Fogelman, calling him a "wondering writer"; he thinks he will give a "smart piece of storytelling".
Casting.
In December 2011, Jami Gertz, Simon Templeman, Toks Olagundoye and Tim Jo obtained roles in the series. It was announced that Gertz would play Debbie Weaver, the matriarch of the human family, Templeman would play Wilt Chamberlain, the leader of the aliens, Olagundoye was cast as Jackie Joyner Kersee, the matriarch of the lead alien family, and Jo would appear as Joe Montana, the son of the alien family. Wilt Chamberlain was originally the lead alien Larry Bird.
In January 2012, Clara Mamet, Ian Patrick and Isabella Cramp garnered roles in the series. Mamet garnered the role of Gertz's teenage daughter, while Patrick and Cramp got kid roles. Later that month, Lenny Venito obtained the lead role as Marty Weaver, the father of the human family. 
Broadcast and reception.
Ratings.
"Pilot" is scheduled to air on ABC on September 26, 2012 after "Modern Family". In Canada, it will air on Saturday at 10:00 p.m. on CTV network in the fall of 2012 after the "Crimetime Saturday" block.
Critical response.
"The Neighbors" received negative treatment at the upfront for the program. Writing for the "San Francisco Chronicle", David Wiegand thought that "The Neighbors" did not look "promising" as it has a high-concept show. Weigand compared it to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) science fiction comedy series "3rd Rock from the Sun", claiming that the series' creator made it so different from "Third Rock From the Sun", that it is "weird". He stated that if "The Neighbors" garnered low ratings, it could possibly be replaced with "Family Tools", an ABC comedy that is scheduled to air in mid-season. He compared it to other comedies set to air on the same channel writing that those are better than "The Neighbors". According to Weigand, "The Neighbors" seems like "Outsourced", which aired for one season on NBC.
Other reviews were more positive. Dave Walker from "The Times-Picayune" thought that "The Neighbors" was a "fish-out-of-water"; he called it a "potentially comedic" show. Rob Owen, a "Pittsburgh Post Gazette" critic, claimed that he has "interest in high-concept shows"; he also "laughed a good bit at the pilot episode". His concern was "how long they can keep up the jokes. Seeing the unusual way aliens do the dishes in the pilot is hilarious. But that gag only works the first time. After that, it's stale."

Doping in China

China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), conducted a state sanctioned doping programme on athletes in the 1980s and 1990s. The majority of revelations of Chinese doping have focused on swimmers. The doping programme has been explained as a by-product of the "open door" policy which saw the rapid expansion within China of modern cultural and technological exchanges with foreign countries. 
Bioethicist Maxwell J. Mehlman in his 2009 book "The Price of Perfection", states that "In effect China has replaced East Germany as the target of Western condemnation of state-sponsored doping". Mehlman quotes an anthropologist as saying that "When China became a 'world sports power', American journalists found it all too easy to slip China into the slot of the 'Big Red Machine' formally occupied by Eastern bloc teams".
Weightlifting, 1997.
One early revelation of the issue of doping in China came in the aftermath of the women's weightlifting competition at the 1997 edition of the country's National Games. Two Americans, conservative pundit Steve Sailer and sports physiologist Stephen Seiler, noted that "tough drug testing is politically impossible" at the Games, and summarized the events there:The 1997 Games in Shanghai were such a bacchanal of doping that all 24 women's weightlifting records were broken, but weightlifting's governing officials had the guts to refuse to ratify any of these absurd marks.
Chinese swimming performances in the 1990s.
In 1992 the number of Chinese swimmers in the top 25 world rankings soared from a plateau of less than 30 to 98, with all but 4 of the 98 swimmers female. Their improvement rate was much better than could have been expected as a result of normal growth and development. China subsequently performed beyond expectations to win 12 gold medals at the 1994 World Aquatics Championships amid widespread suspicions of doping. Chinese swimmers won 12 of 16 gold medals at the 1994 championships and set five world records. 
Between 1990 and 1998, 28 Chinese swimmers tested positive for performance enhancing drugs, almost half the world total of drug offenders in sport. Seven swimmers tested positive for steroids at the Asian Games in Hiroshima in late 1994, these positive tests badly affected the squad to the extent that it won only one swimming gold at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Following the revelations of doping among Chinese swimmers at the Hiroshima games IOC Medical Commission chairman Alexandre de Mérode discounted the possibility of officially sanctioned Chinese doping stating that the results were "accidents that could happen anywhere". Chinese leaders initially blamed racist sports officials in Japan for manufacturing test results. A report by a joint International Swimming Federation and Olympic Council of Asia delegation to Beijing in 1995 concluded that "there is no evidence that the Chinese are systematically doping athletes". The revelations led to Australian, American, Canadian and Japanese sports officials voting against Chinese participation at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. In 1995 the Chinese "People's Daily" newspaper published an anti-doping policy and proclaimed an official prohibition on performance enhancing substances.
China improved in swimming until 1998 when four more positive tests and the discovery of human growth hormone (HGH) in the swimmer Yuan Yuan's luggage at the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Australia. In the routine customs check on the swimmer's bag, enough HGH was discovered to supply the entire women's swimming team for the duration of the championships. Only Yuan Yuan was sanctioned for the incident, with speculation that this was connected to the nomination of Juan Antonio Samaranch by China for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. Tests in Perth found the presence of the banned diuretic masking agent triamterine in the urine of four swimmers, Wang Luna, Yi Zhang, Huijue Cai and Wei Wang. The swimmers were suspended from competition for two years, with three coaches associated with the swimmers, Zhi Cheng, Hiuqin Xu and Zhi Cheng each suspended for three months.
Zhao Jian, the deputy director-general of the China Anti-Doping Agency described the 1998 World Aquatic Championships as a "bad incident", and said that it had led to China adopting a tougher attitude towards drug testing, with drug testing removed from the main sports administration and placed in a separate agency.
The Hiroshima games also saw a hurdler, a cyclist and two canoeists test positive for the steroid dihydrotestosterone.
Chen Zhangho and Xue Yinxian revelations.
In a July 2012 interview published by the "Sydney Morning Herald" newspaper, Chen Zhangho, the lead doctor for the Chinese Olympic team at the Los Angeles, Seoul and Barcelona Olympics told of how he had tested hormones, blood doping and steroids on about fifty elite athletes. Chen also accused the United States, the Soviet Union and France of using performance-enhancing drugs at the same time as China. Chen also blamed foreign experts for "lying" to the Chinese about the effectiveness of doping, saying he and others "blindly believed them like fools". The Chinese officials eventually concluded that training was the key to performance and that taking drugs did not guarantee this.
Chen said that half of the athletes found doping effective and half did not, adding that he had steered away from growth hormones to steroids because they were cheaper. Chen said he was governed by three principles, that the athlete took the substances voluntarily, that no harm was caused and that they were effective.
Xue Yinxian, former chief doctor for the Chinese gymnastics team, had previously told the newspaper that official use of steroids and growth hormone was "rampant" in the 1980s. Xue claimed that steroids and human growth hormones were officially treated as part of "scientific training", and athletes often did not know what they were being injected with. Xue did not allege that all Chinese athletes used drugs and has refrained from naming individual athletes.

Coos Bay Rail Link

The Coos Bay Rail Link is a railroad line from the Willamette Valley to the Port of Coos Bay on the Oregon Coast.
History.
On September 21, 2007, Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad (CORP) elected to shut down most of its Coos Bay branch. The track was closed between Vaughn, Oregon (west of Noti) and Coquille, Oregon (south of Coos Bay). This action was taken after it was revealed that the nine aging tunnels on the line required repairs that were internally estimated to cost up to $7 million. Some local opinion regarded this action unfavorably, as the railroad asked for state funds to repair their private rail line.
On October 23, 2007, the Port of Coos Bay filed a $15 million lawsuit against CORP, in response to its closing of the Coos Bay Branch. The suit claims that CORP failed to provide the required 180 days' notice that it would shut down a leased spur to the bay's North Spit.
On November 21, 2008, the Surface Transportation Board ordered CORP to sell part of the branch to the Port of Coos Bay for $16.6 million. The segment links Danebo, Oregon, in northeast Eugene, and Cordes siding, just north of North Bend. The price was much less than what RailAmerica, CORP's corporate parent, had desired ($25 million), and much closer to what the port had initially offered ($15 million). The Port completed the purchase of the line in 2009 and repaired the tunnels that led to the line's closure. The Port reopened the line in 2011 as Coos Bay Rail Link.
In 2012, the railroad is continuing with rehabilitation of a $30 million rehabilitation of the line funded primarily by grants. Work is going forward in fixing the railroad bridge into North Bend and track infrastructure to Coquille as well as repairs to track, bridges, and crossings on the entire line. The Eugene Register Guard reported in its October 14, 2012 edition that the first locomotive to enter North Bend/Coos Bay in 5 years did so on October 12, 2012. It did not mark official reopening of this stretch of track. The locomotive was part of a work train hauling materials into the area to do repairs on the line.
On April 29, 2013, CBR restored full service to the 134-mile Coos Bay rail line. CBR marked the day by hauling the first rail cars of plywood in 5.5 years from the Roseburg Forest Products mill in Coquille, Ore., north toward connections in Eugene, Ore., with the North American freight rail system.

Kayla Bashore (born February 20, 1983 in Daegu, South Korea) is an American field hockey defender and midfielder. Now living in San Diego, California, she was a student of the Indiana University and was the first player from that university to make the US National Field Hockey team. She represented the USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Kayla grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania. Growing up, Kayla did not find her sporting love in field hockey, but in soccer instead. It was not until high school that she picked up her first field hockey stick. The field hockey coach of the high school saw her playing and immediately wanted her on the team. Throughout the year, the coached constantly asked her to consider playing field hockey instead, but Kayla did not want anything to do with it. Finally, after persisting, Kayla decided to play field hockey and after that moment she realized she had made a good choice. She immediately fell in love with it. From then on out she excelled at the sport and played at the top of her team. After graduating from Hamburg Area High School, she made her way onto Indiana University's team. After playing on the team for four years, in the last couple months of her senior year, she got asked to join the United States National Field Hockey Team. After that, she made her way to San Diego, California, to start to train alongside of the team. This is where she grew into the field hockey player she is today. Her and the team went through rigorous training daily to achieve these goals. The team first qualified for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. Alongside of her team, her whole family made the trip over to support her in her dreams. In the Games, the team did not win any medals. Throughout the following four years they trained harder so they would be able to go to the 2012 Olympics in London, England. They did just that. Her family again was there to support them on. During the games, they did beat their biggest rival team, Argentina. The team did not win any medal during those Games either. A few months after the Olympics, Kayla decided it was time to hang up the shoes and retire. She retired with over 100 international appearances.

Dragonfish nebula

The "Dragonfish Nebula" as is known for its appearance on infrared images is a massive emission nebula and star-forming region, at 30,000 light years of the Sun in the direction of the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross.
Characteristics.
Due its distance and location it's totally invisible in visible light as the interstellar dust absorbs and reddens its light hiding it, so in order to study it wavelengths that are not affected by it like the infrared are required.
Research done with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope show this object has a size of 450 light years, having a largue cavity with a diameter of 100 light years that has been originated by the strong stellar winds of the young and massive stars inside it.
As of 2011, approximately 400 stars of spectral types O and B have been identified within the nebula; subsequent studies have confirmed not only at least 15 O-type stars but also 3 Luminous Blue Variable/Wolf-Rayet star candidates but also have calculated a total mass of the stars associated with the Dragonfish nebula of 105, only comparable in mass with the super star cluster Westerlund 1, being respectively the most massive stellar association and the brightest nebula known in our galaxy.

The Week the Women Went (U.S. TV series)

The Week The Women Went is a 2012 reality series narrated by Jeff Foxworthy on the Lifetime Channel and produced by BBC Worldwide Productions. The show is an American version of a BBC show of the same name.
Premise.
The show follows the town of Yemassee, South Carolina as all of the adult women in the community leave for a week. The men are then left on their own to take on the responsibilities of the women, which includes childcare, house cleaning, and employment.
Reception and criticisms.
Hit Fix criticized the show's premise of being a "social experiment", stating that it felt more like a sitcom, that it perpetuated stereotypes of both men and Southerners, and that "losing fifty percent of the adults in town is going to create a hardship, regardless of whether they're male or female". Other criticisms focused on the helplessness of the men in the show, with one person stating that "I get that it is supposed to be a fish out of water story ... but if you have a 9-year-old daughter and you cannot brush her hair, you aren't a fish out of water. You are a bad father".

Triptych (Frey novel)

Triptych is a 2011 debut novel by Canadian author J.M. Frey. The novel follows three narrators as they recount the events surrounding major turning points in the life of Gwen Pierson, a languages specialist: Evvie Pierson, Gwen's mother a housewife in rural southern Ontario; Kalp, an alien refugee from a dead planet living in England and Gwen's lover; and Basil Grey, a Welsh computer engineer.
It has been described as both science fiction and as literary fiction, and has been praised for blending both genres. It has also been praised for the distinctive voices of the narrators, and for its structure: the novel, rather than chapters, is segmented into three novella-length parts (each narrated by a different character – Evvie, Kalp, and Basil) which hinge together to tell the whole story. Frey deliberately chose this structure to mimic the artistic triptych technique.
Triptych received a starred review from Publisher's Weekly, and was named the #3 best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror book of 2011 by Publishers Weekly's Rose Fox. Triptych was also nominated for the CBC Bookie Award for Science Fiction, the Lambda Literary Award for Bisexual Fiction, and the Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction. Triptych won best Science Fiction Book at the 2012 San Francisco Book Festival, and was given an honourable mention for Science Fiction Book at the 2012 London Book Festival.
The book was the #2 ebook best seller on Amazon.com its debut weekend, behind George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones.
Plot Summary.
Before
The novel begins in a small Welsh town in 2013, where Basil Grey, a mechanical engineer and a member of the United Nation's run Institute, has just witnessed his lover, an alien named Kalp, being shot to death in their living room. Basil's coworkers, led by Agent Aitken, shot him for a traitor and a spy, and drag Basil out of the house and to the Institute's interrogation rooms. He is joined by his wife, Gwen Pierson, and as she tries to convince him that Kalp had betrayed them, Basil has a revelation about a small mechanical device he had seen in the Institutes workrooms, which he has nicknamed a "Flasher".
Part I: Back
Narrated by Evvie Pierson, the first part of the book opens on a fall day in 1983 on the Pierson Family farm. Evvie's gardening is interrupted when an alien spaceship crash lands in her raspberry patch and the pilot attempts to murder both her and her infant daughter, Gwennie. They are saved by Basil Grey and an adult Gwen Pierson, who didn't realize that the Flasher would make them travel backwards in time.
Over the course of twenty four hours, Basil attempts to repair the Flasher so they can make a return trip to the 21st Century; Gwen, Basil, and her father Mark bury both the body of the alien pilot and the space ship; and Gwen reveals to Evvie that they have a tumultuous relationship in the future and that Gwen has stopped speaking to her mother. Evvie blames herself and resolves to do her best to repair the rift when Gwen has grown up. Gwen also reveals that she was married to both Kalp and Basil in a triad relationship called an Aglunate, a tradition of Kalp's people, but that Kalp was killed for selling secrets about the Institute to a group of assassins who are targeting Institute employees. With the help Evvie, Basil and Gwen realize that the assassins are time travelling to target Aglunated Institute Employees and as such, Kalp can't have been the traitor.
Overwhelmed with relief and grieving their lost lover, Basil and Gwen return to 2013 to clear Kalp's name and to try to locate the actual traitor.
Evvie writes a letter to Kalp, intending to warn him of his impending death in an effort to change the future.
Part II: Middle
Told from Kalp's POV, this section encompasses his first meeting with Basil and Gwen (who are already dating and living together) at the Institute through to his death. Kalp is assigned to a team with Gwen and Basil, who are working together to try to build a solar power generator based on shared alien technology. Over the course of the section, it is revealed that Kalp's home planet was destroyed in a natural disaster and a very small ship of refugees was able to escape and seek asylum on Earth. Kalp's family – his Agulnates Maru and Trus – were among the dead. Kalp had volunteered to work at the Institute, which was set up by the United Nations in an effort to aid the aliens in acclimatizing to human cultures.
Overwhelmed by the kindness shown to him by Basil and Gwen, Kalp soon falls in love with the couple and moves in with them. He convinces them to become his lovers on Christmas Eve, several hours after Gwen has revealed that she has fallen pregnant with Basil's child. There is an extremely negative media backlash to their Aglunation, and as a result the Aglunate is attacked outside of a concert hall. Gwen loses the baby and Kalp is grievously injured.
An unknown assassins group begins to target Institute Employees, and Kalp is suspected of selling Institute training secrets to the group and placed under house arrest. Kalp receives a vaguely threatening letter from an anonymous stranger and decides that he must attempt to escape the Institute and clear his name. He is, however, caught by Agent Aitken and shot.
Part III: After
Basil and Gwen have returned to 2013 twenty four hours after they left. At first they are taken into custody for being AWOL and theft, but they eventually convince the Institute of both Kalp's innocence and their own. They are allowed to join a secret ops mission to break the assassin's circle and capture the ring leaders.
During the assault, Gwen and Basil stumble upon a warehouse where exactly the same alien ship that they shot down in 1983 is preparing to travel back in time. They are surprised by the pilot – not an alien after all, but Agent Aitken, who reveals that she is both the mastermind behind the assassins circle and the traitor. She is an extreme bigot and zealot and has vowed to purge the world of the disgusting, unnatural people who participate in Aglunates, and has figured out how to use the alien technology to travel in time to kill those who accept and love the aliens before they can grow up and pevert the Institute.
Gwen is injured in the attempt to stop her, and Basil unsuccessful at destroying the ship. He is, however, able to sabbotauge it. He then realizes that Agent Aitken has travelled back to the Pierson Farm in 1983, where he and Gwen will shot the ship down and kill Aitken before the rogue agent has the ability to murder infant Gwennie.
Next
Basil and Gwen travel to the Pierson Farm in 2013 to retrieve the buried space ship and Aitken's remains. They travel alone in order to maintain their privacy and to keep media speculation to a minimum before the trial of the remaining assissins.
After they have unburied the space ship, Mark coerces Basil to join him in mucking out barn. They discuss Basil's intentions towards Gwen, and Mark reminds Basil that he owes him a favour for destroying their betamax. Mark then offers Basil a family heirloom ring with which he'd like Basil to propose marriage to Gwen.
Basil decides that he will, both in memory of Kalp and in order to open a new chapter in their lives where the shadow of the tragedy can finally be left behind. As he approaches the farm house with the ring, Basil catches sight of Evvie and Gwen's tearful reconciliation through the kitchen window.
Characters.
Main Characters.
Gwen Pierson – a Canadian woman in her early thirties. She specializes in languages, and was recruited to the Institute to help translate alien documents and speeches. She is Basil's girlfriend at the beginning of the novel and eventually also falls in love with and marries both Kalp and Basil in a traditional alien triad arrangement called an Aglunate. Gwen is initially extremely reluctant to enter into the Aglunate, but does eventually come to love Kalp as deeply as she loves Basil. Gwen is taciturn, generally snarky, and an only child.
Kalp – an alien refugee from a dead world. Kalp was a structural engineer/architect on his home planet, and was in an Aglunate with Maru and Trus, who both died with the natural disaster struck. Desperately lonely and suffering acute culture shock at the beginning of the novel, he learns to adjust to Earth and falls in love with Gwen and Basil, his coworkers at the Institute. They eventually form an Aglunate of their own.
Basil Grey – a Welsh mechanical engineer and super-geek. He was recruited to the Institute to help recreate beneficial alien technologies and placed on a team with Gwen. He wooed her with dirty alien poetry, and later enters into an Aglunate with Gwen and Kalp. He has two older sisters and several nieces and nephews, whom he adores. Frey admits that the inspiration for Basil came from both actor David Hewlett and the character he portrayed in Stargate: Atlantis, Dr. Rodney McKay, screenwriter Martin Gero, and the character Rhys Williams in Torchwood. Frey wanted to create an amalgam that represented the Geek Everyman she sees at science fiction conventions, the sort of person who would revel in being dropped suddenly into a world where science fiction has become social fact.
Evvie Pierson – A Canadian farmer's wife, and Gwen's mother. Evvie attempts to be open-minded about her daughter's relationships but doesn't approve of Basil, initially, and his horrified to learn that Gwen is sleeping with an alien. Eventually she comes to understand that Gwen is happy with her lovers, and to accept that her own perceptions of appropriate need to alter.
Mark Pierson – a Canadian farmer, and Gwen's father.
Agent Aitken – a zealot and bigot who works for the Institute and is disgusted by all humans who fall in love and enter into sexual relationships with the aliens. She is secretly the head of a ring of assassins who are killing Aglunates, and murders Kalp. She is killed attempting to murder Gwen.
Secondary Characters.
Maru – Kalp's first Aglunated. Deceased.
Trus – Kalp's first Aglunated. Deceased.

Select Reviews:
"Debut author Frey knocks it out of the park with a remarkable tale of alien refugees, time travel, intrigue, the pervasive madness of grief, and love that transcends culture, gender, and species. Classic science fiction elements are smoothly updated for a modern audience." – Publishers Weekly's Rose Fox 
"Time travel, aliens, and the politics of sexuality combine with tragic violence in Frey's deeply satisfying debut. Aliens seeking refuge from their broken planet find it on peaceful Earth. Gwen Pierson and Basil Grey work for the U.N., helping the aliens to integrate. When alien Kalp joins their team, they learn that Kalp's people mate in threes, and soon the trio become the first human–alien marriage. Violent protests and assassinations threaten to unravel the fragile trust between the refugees and their human hosts, so Gwen and Basil follow the assassins--back in time to the 1980s, where Gwen's parents are still adjusting to raising newborn Gwennie. The near paradox is appropriately disorienting, but the story is so well-grounded in the characters that it never once loses its course. Frey tells the story from varying points of view in distinct voices, imagining a world at once completely alien and utterly human."—Publishers Weekly Starred Review 
"A stirring adventure, as well as a tender love story, from a first time author who truly embraces the limitless possibilities the future may bring. JM Frey's Triptych satisfies any sci-fi reader looking for a different take on the first contact motif, or anyone looking to explore the possible evolution of human sexuality and love."
–Lambda Literary, Read the full review
"I was afraid we'd be left with a lot of technical asides and scientific musings to explore the aliens. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Instead of being cold and clinical, the approach here is warm and human. I won't spoil any of what happens between them, but I will say I shed tears of joy and tears of sorrow for this unusual family, and that's an accomplishment few authors can claim. Not only is this a wonderful story, but it's a wonderfully told story."
–Sally Sapphire, The Bibrary Bookslut
"I finished Triptych in one go last night, couldn't put it down even. It's a very impressive first novel and if Ms. Frey continues to do with science fiction what she's done in this book she might single-handedly be credited with reviving the entire genre. Bravo! Encore, encore!"
–Todd McCaffrey, author of The Dragonriders of Pern series
Triptych has also been panned as an extended treatise on alien/human sex and for its lack of worldbuilding and depth of exploration of Kalp's homeworld and culture. However, other commentors have pointed out that Kalp's assimilation into Earth culture is what feeds the tragedy of his life.

RNE Ràdio 4 is a Barcelona-based radio station broadcasting to the Catalan-speaking population of the provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona in northeastern Spain. It is part of the country's national public radio and television service, RTVE.
RNE Ràdio 4 was launched in 1976 during the Spanish transition to democracy, and was integrated into a regional countrywide Radio 4 network in 1988 after the closure of the state-owned but commercially funded Radiocadena Española in that same year. The integrated regional countrywide Radio 4 network was shut down in 1991 due to poor ratings, and RNE Ràdio 4 once again became a standalone radio station.
In 2006 however, RNE Ràdio 4 was itself threatened with the prospect of closure due to a very low audience share (only 8,500 listeners in Catalonia out of a population of 7.5 million people). This sparked a campaign against closure of the station, which eventually proved successful after Santiago Gonzalez, the then newly appointed director of RNE (Radio Nacional de España), decided against closing Ràdio 4.

Dina Bajraktarević

Hajrudina Bajraktarević (born 19 March, c. late 1950s), known professionally as Dina Bajraktarević, is a Bosnian former singer and the younger sister of Silvana Armenulić and Mirsada Bajraktarević. Her sisters died together in a car crash in 1976.
Early life and family.
Hajrudina Bajraktarević was born in the Bosnian city of Doboj in the 1950s to a Muslim Bosniak family with thirteen children. Her mother's name was Hajrija (25 November 1916 – 2008) and her father was Mehmed Bajraktarević (1913–1965). Her sister Silvana (born Zilha) started singing at an early age, but their father, a local cake shop operator, was not supportive of her singing career.
Dina had a brother named Hajrudin who died about two weeks after being mauled by a dog in the 1940s. After her brothers death, her father found solace in alcohol and solitude, neglecting the family and his business. After her father's cake shop closed, the family suffered greatly. The family of thirteen children included sisters Hajrudina, Zilha (Silvana), Abida, Mirsada (Mirjana) and Ševka, and brothers Hajrudin, Muhamed, Izudin, Abudin, and Ismet.
Career.
In 1955, Silvana moved to Sarajevo at the age of sixteen where she lived with her aunt and sang in local kafanas for money. She eventually landed a professional singing career which led way to sister Mirsada getting a record deal and recording her first album at the age of eighteen in 1969 and releasing it in 1970.
The singing sisters, Silvana and Mirjana, died together in a car crash on 10 October 1976 near the Serbian village Kolari. At the time, Mirjana, who was in the second term of her pregnancy, was sharing a home with Dina.
After their deaths, Dina was approached to release an album. Hesitant to sing professionally at first, she ended up releasing three extended plays: one in 1978, 1979 and 1980. She had major success with the song "Sudbina je tako htjela" ("Fate Wanted It That Way"). She then took a break from music and had two sons, Silvano and Silvan, with her husband singer Žika Nikolić. Their sons Silvano and Silvan, named after Dina's late sister Silvana, are singers as well, although Silvano is not singing actively anymore, whilst Silvan is taking music to a professional level with his voice.
Bajraktarević made a return to music in 1987 with a full length studio album, "Dođi dragi ne dangubi" ("Come Dear, Do Not Waste Time"). That was her final release before retiring from music.
