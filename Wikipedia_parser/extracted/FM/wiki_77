Bacho Kiro

Bacho Kiro () (7 July 1835 – 28 May 1876) was the nickname of Kiro Petrov Zanev (Киро Петров Занев), a Bulgarian teacher, man of letters and revolutionary who took an active part in the April Uprising.
Bacho Kiro was born in what is today Byala Cherkva, Veliko Tarnovo Province (then called Gorni Turcheta), to the family of the herdsman Petar Zanev. After finishing the religious school in his village, he joined the Batoshevo Monastery as a neophyte. From 1852 on, he worked as a teacher in various villages, including Koevtsi, Musina, Mihaltsi, Vishovgrad and his native Byala Cherkva, where he lived and taught from 1857 to 1876 with some interruptions. Bacho Kiro also travelled around the Bulgarian lands by foot, calling for armed resistance against the Ottoman rule, and visited Istanbul, Mount Athos, Belgrade and Bucharest. Bacho Kiro established a number of cultural centres ("chitalishta"); in February 1872, he became the Byala Cherkva head of Vasil Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation.
Upon the outbreak of the April Uprising in 1876, Bacho Kiro was among the uprising's leaders in the Tarnovo district and a sub-voivode in Father Hariton's detachment. Bacho Kiro took part in the Dryanovo Monastery fightings, and although his detachment was routed by the Ottomans, he managed to escape. However, he was betrayed and captured by the Ottoman government. He was sentenced to death and hanged in Tarnovo. Before his execution, he held a passionate speech and did not ask for mercy.
Bacho Kiro was the author of some travel notes and the drama piece "Poor Man Tancho". The Bacho Kiro cave near Dryanovo is named in his honour.

Psychrotrophic bacteria

Psychrotrophic bacteria are bacteria that are capable of surviving or even thriving in a cold environment. They provide an estimation of the product's shelf life, also they can be found in soils, in surface and deep sea waters, in Antarctic ecosystems, and in foods.
They are responsible for spoiling refrigerated foods.
Psychrotrophic bacteria are of particular concern to the dairy industry. Most are killed by pasteurization; however, they can be present in milk as post-pasteurization contaminants due to less than adequate sanitation practices. According to The Food Science Department at Cornell University, psychrotrophs are bacteria capable of growth at temperatures at or less than 7°C (44.6°F). At freezing temperatures, growth of psychrotrophic bacteria becomes negligible or virtually stops.

Obrascón Huarte Lain

Obrascón Huarte Lain, S.A. (), or OHL, is a Spanish-based multinational construction and civil engineering company. The company is involved in infrastructure and commercial property construction, homebuilding and the operation of toll road and other transport concessions. In the latter, the group is particularly active in Brazil through its majority-owned subsidiary OHL Brasil and in Mexico with OHL México. OHL also has a majority-owned American subsidiary called Tower-OHL Group which is based in Miami, Florida.
OHL was founded by the $900 million merger in 1999 of the firms Obrascón-Huarte and Construcciones Lain. Since July 2008 the company has been a constituent of the benchmark IBEX 35 stock market index on the Bolsa de Madrid.
History.
The company's roots stretch back to May 1911 and the foundation of Sociedad General de Obras y Construcciones Obrascón, S.A., whose first project was the construction of two wharfs in the Port of Lisbon. The company grew over the decades, being acquired first by the Banco de Bilbao in 1953 and then by Altos Hornos de Vizcaya 20 years later. Obrascón fell into financial difficulties in the late 1980s, however, and was bought from bankruptcy for one penny in 1987 by Juan-Miguel Villar Mir, who remains the company's chairman today. Villar turned around the firm's fortunes and it listed on the Bolsa de Madrid in 1991.
In 1998 Obrascón merged with its larger, but struggling, rival Huarte, a major construction firm established in Pamplona in 1927. The following year a further merger was conducted with Construcciones Lain, a publicly traded firm originally founded as the Spanish arm of John Laing Construction in 1963. This deal created the Obrascón Huarte Lain group in its current form.
On November 30, 2010, OHL acquired 50.1% of the US construction company Judlau Contracting, Inc., specialized in civil engineering with headquarters operations in the state of New York.
On April 16, 2014, OHL lost the largest case for damages in the history of Gibraltar, having been judged to fail to comply with the terms of a contract to build a tunnel to cross the Gibraltar International Airport runway.
In May 2014, Miguel Fraile testified to Quebec's Charbonneau Commission that a Quebec-based competitor firm, SNC-Lavalin (SNC), wanted the business of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) to itself. SNC vice-president Riadh Ben Aissa “started by asking, who am I? Who is OHL? We are nothing. We are nobody. Montreal is SNC’s city, the MUHC is its project” as the corruption inquiry continued its study of the CAD$1.3-billion hospital project. Fraile reported that Ben Aissa told him OHL must withdraw from the bidding, which was set close in March of 2010, and that SNC was a “powerful company in Canada," and if OHL dropped out of the bid, the two firms might be able to team up in the future. “He said that if we won the contract, he would make our lives impossible.” The senior management of SNC, including Ben Aissa, has since been charged or dismissed under suspicion, and the premises have been raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. OHL did not win the MUHC bid, even though it outbid SNC by $60 million.

French heraldry

French heraldry is the use of heraldic symbols in France. Although it had a considerable history, like England, existing from the 11th century, such formality has largely died out in France. The role of the herald ("héraut") in France declined in the 17th century. Many of the terms in international heraldry come from French.
Characteristics.
French heraldry has a set system of crown and coronets. Supporters are not linked with any rank or title, unlike the coronets, and are far less common than in other forms of European heraldry, such as English heraldry. Even the Royal Arms' angelic supporters are not shown in most depictions. Crests are rare in modern depictions, again in contrast to England.
National Emblem of France.
The current emblem of France has been a symbol of France since 1953, although it does not have any legal status as an official coat of arms. It appears on the cover of French passports and was originally adopted by the French Foreign Ministry as a symbol for use by diplomatic and consular missions in 1912 using a design drawn up by the sculptor Jules-Clément Chaplain.
In 1953, France received a request from the United Nations for a copy of the national coat of arms to be displayed alongside the coats of arms of other member states in its assembly chamber. An interministerial commission requested Robert Louis (1902–1965), heraldic artist, to produce a version of the Chaplain design. This did not, however, constitute an adoption of an official coat of arms by the Republic.
Technically speaking, it is an emblem rather than a coat of arms, since it does not respect heraldic rules—heraldry being seen as an aristocratic art, and therefore associated with the Ancien Régime. The emblem consists of:
Fleur-de-lys.
The fleur-de-lys (or fleur-de-lis, plural: fleurs-de-lis; , in Quebec French), translated from French as "lily flower") is a stylized design of either an iris or a lily that is now used purely decoratively as well as symbolically, or it may be "at one and the same time political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic and symbolic", especially in heraldry. 
While the fleur-de-lis has appeared on countless European coats of arms and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the French monarchy on a historical context, and nowadays with the Spanish monarchy and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as the only remaining monarchs of the House of Bourbon. 
It is an enduring symbol of France that appears on French postage stamps but has not been adopted officially by any of the French republics.
Arms of major cities.
All major cities within France have coats of arms; these are often intertwined with local traditions over history.
Regions of France.
Each region of France has its own coat of arms, although usage varies:
Départments.
Few départments have official arms. There may be substantial disagreements with this table.

Elizabeth Murray Campbell Smith Inman

Elizabeth Murray Campbell Smith Inman (July 7, 1726 – May 25, 1785) was a shopkeeper, teacher, philanthropist, and proto-feminist in Boston, Massachusetts, before, during, and after the American Revolution. Elizabeth spent much of her adult life teaching her nieces and female friends the importance of personal financial autonomy through shopkeeping and other traditionally female domestic duties.
Biography.
Early life.
Elizabeth was born in and spent the first twelve years of her life in Unthank, Scotland, until her older brother James, an up-and-coming merchant, brought her to his new North Carolina home to be his housekeeper. In this capacity, Elizabeth learned the attendant responsibilities, such as "keeping accounts with local merchants and vendors, selecting and purchasing the items needed for household consumption, overseeing the work of any servants, and performing numerous chores associated with housecleaning and preparing food and clothing" 
At seventeen, she moved with James and his new bride to London, where Elizabeth saw the city bustling with shop-owning women who sold wide arrays of cloth and other popular goods from all over the world. Also, London, offered her a chance to see the latest fashions in ladies' clothing that were so popular both in Great Britain and in its colonies.
Sailing back to America, the Murrays stopped in Boston, and Elizabeth, now twenty-three, decided to stay in the bustling commercial hub to open her own shop. Because many urban women were running taverns and small schools, it was considered an appropriate extension of women's acceptable domestic duties to support themselves through businesses they ran out of their homes.
Career.
Backed by her brother's mercantile connections in Great Britain, Elizabeth established credit in the commercial world and was able to sell the latest fashions from London in her Boston shop. She advertised in local newspapers, such as the "Boston Gazette" and the "Boston Evening-Post", showcasing both her world-class ladies' apparel and her talents as a teacher of "Needle Works". Additionally, Elizabeth allowed her female students to board with her, to supplement her income. After a trip to London to make more business connections, Elizabeth returned to Boston and sent for James' daughter Dolly, wanting to give her the chance to pursue the "superior educational opportunities" in the northern city. Dolly worked under both Elizabeth and other local women to gain an education in arithmetic, shopkeeping, reading, and sewing.
In 1755, Elizabeth got married to a trader and ship's captain, Thomas Campbell, thereby trading in her status as an independent single woman for the protection (and legal limitations) of "couverture". Their union signified a business partnership, in which Thomas handled the larger commercial transactions, while Elizabeth ran the shop. Additionally, she became part of a female network of shop-owners and teachers in Boston with whom she interacted and traded services with daily. However, by the age of thirty-two, Elizabeth became widowed when Thomas died of the measles in 1759.
By 1760, Elizabeth married for a second time to a wealthy old widower named James Smith, who would change her financial status for the rest of her life. Under their prenuptial agreement, James stipulated that she would not be rendered personally, legally, or financial dependent under couverture; instead, Elizabeth would be allowed to keep all of her own money that she had earned as a shopkeeper, and would be entitled to one-third of his considerable estate if he died before her. Because of their wealth, both Elizabeth and James stopped working and enjoyed a leisurely life in Brush Hill, outside of Boston. She did, however, continue to teach women the ways of shopkeeping and other business ventures, financially helping out young women like her nieces Dolly, Betsy, and Anne, as well as local up-and-coming merchants like Ame and Elizabeth Cumings. Additionally, Elizabeth's single, independent friend and protégé Jannette Day enjoyed the financial and emotional support of her friend.
By 1763, Elizabeth's ventures in helping her female friends and family were stymied by the violence in the Boston streets, when colonists became enraged at the taxes imposed on them by the British government. Growing out of the resentment of the Sugar Acts of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 were boycotts on British goods and attacks on loyalists like Andrew Oliver and Thomas Hutchinson. Because Elizabeth's brother James and her husband were involved in housing British soldiers in James Smith's sugar factory when the British landed in Boston in 1768, she and her family became vulnerable to the rioters' hostilities. When her second husband died, Elizabeth became a woman of great wealth, further solidifying her status as an independent, wealthy widow. She decided to leave for London to escape the violence running rampant in Boston; but before she left on a dangerous journey across the Atlantic, Elizabeth wrote her will, leaving lots of money to her family and female friends like Jannette Day and her daughter Jackie.
When Elizabeth visited her brother John's family in Norwich, England, she decided to take his daughter Mary Murray (nicknamed Polly) under her wing, teaching her all that she herself had learned as a shopkeeper in Boston. She immediately set upon sending Polly to Boston to make connections in the commercial world and boarding with her merchant friends, the Cumings sisters. They would teach her all she needed to know about shopkeeping and running a business for herself. Additionally, Elizabeth sent her young nephew Jack to voyage with his sister across the Atlantic to Boston, in hopes of his becoming an apprentice for a successful merchant cousin in Rhode Island. Despite the unrest growing in Boston and many of her friends becoming attacked for importing British goods, Elizabeth decided to send Polly and Jack to Boston, anyway. To Elizabeth's surprise, when the Cumings sisters were publicly reviled in the press, their business turned even more successful, because of their insistence on " 'Striving in an honest way to Git there Bread'." Thus, women were finding themselves thrust into a world in which their decisions to purchase goods had become fraught with political meaning.
Returning to Boston in April 1771 with her new charge Jackie, Elizabeth found Boston much calmer than when she had left a year and a half earlier. She decided to remarry for a third time to fellow shopkeeper Ralph Inman, who would help improve her finances, which she realized were not in good order upon her return to Boston. She and Ralph signed a prenuptial agreement that allowed her to keep her wealth and continue to help young women get started in business. Unfortunately, she quickly learned that this marriage was not a good match, emotionally. Boston's turmoil with the British began to flare up again, and she removed to Cambridge with her niece Dolly to oversee her and her husband's estate, despite the fact that most women were leaving the area altogether. Her husband and her brother remained in Boston, now occupied and closed off by the British, under General Thomas Gage. Elizabeth wrote her husband repeatedly, even after rebel troops had kept her prisoner in her own house, but Ralph did not respond to her entreaties for him to join her in Cambridge. She stayed on in Cambridge, without her husband's protection, "overseeing crops, financial matters, and business decisions," all the while feeling abandoned by Ralph. When Ralph did contact his wife that he needed money, he urged her to come to Boston to join him, something she refused to do. When she insisted on defying her husband's wishes, Ralph made plans to sail to Great Britain without her, thereby separating from her indefinitely. Elizabeth decided that her brother James' daughter Betsy should stay with her and learn more shopkeeping, despite the Revolution taking place in Boston. She finally went to Boston to assist her niece Anne Murray, who was working in a Boston shop. When she realized Anne was unhappy with shopkeeping and wished to get married and leave America, Elizabeth did all she could to help solidify the union. Ralph was arrested before he could leave Boston and his property was seized by rebel forces in 1776.
She was later castigated in the press for befriending a Scottish officer taken prisoner in Boston named Archibald Campbell, perhaps related to her first husband. She sent him various items in prison to assuage the pain of his imprisonment, such as books, rum, coffee, and sugar. She continued this relationship, despite smears on her name that associated her with political activity and prostitution.
When the war drew to a close and her brother James died, many of Elizabeth's nieces and nephews came to live with her and Ralph in Cambridge or nearby. The war had destroyed her and her husband's finances, but they decided to stay with one another. Elizabeth continued to urge her kin to come to Boston to take up shopkeeping, until she fell ill in the spring of 1785. Prior to her death, she drew up a new will that bequeathed much of what was left of her estate to her family, particularly here nieces and family friends.
Death and afterward.
Elizabeth Murray Campbell Smith Inman died on May 25, 1785, with Polly and Betsy at her side. She was buried in a tomb alongside her second husband, James Smith, at the cemetery in King's Chapel in Boston. Her husband, Ralph Inman, received relatively little of her fortune, causing a great deal of stress for Elizabeth's nieces and the rest of her family in disputing her will.

Pediatric Attention Disorders Diagnostic Screener

The Pediatric Attention Disorders Diagnostic Screener (PADDS), created by Dr. Thomas K. Pedigo and Kenneth L. Pedigo, is a suite of computer administered neuropsychological tests of attention and executive functioning. The PADDS is used in the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children between the ages of 6 to 12 years. The PADDS software program represents a multi-dimensional, evidence-based approach to ADHD assessment, consisting of the Computer Administered Diagnostic Interview (CADI), the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham—IV (SNAP-IV) Parent and Teacher rating scales, and the three computer-administered objective measures of the Target Tests of Executive Functioning (TTEF). It calculates a diagnostic likelihood ratio, where each unique data source is allowed to contribute to (or detract from) the prediction of the diagnosis, as well as normalized relative standard scores, t-scores, z-scores, and percentile ranks for comparison to the non-clinical reference group.
PADDS history and development.
One of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders referred to mental health clinicians is ADHD.
It is a complicated neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder and has an estimated range of occurrence of 2 to 3 percent of the school population and up to 10 percent in other settings. Thus, on average a minimum of at least one child with ADHD and executive functioning disorders is in each classroom in American schools. (Reddy et al.) (Rowland, Leswesne, & Abramowitz, 2002)
indicated that prevalence rates for ADHD vary markedly based on presenting symptoms, different assessment approaches used, and the various settings in which the child was tested. A lack of a consensus on what constitutes the core set of symptoms for ADHD complicates and confounds the screening and assessment process (Brown, 2002).
Due to these concerns regarding prevalence rates of ADHD, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2000) and the National Institute of Health (NIH, 1998) have stressed the need to develop new standardized, evidence-based assessments that have strong psychometric properties, and are easily administered in schools and other clinical settings.
The major considerations guiding the development of the PADDS is integrating an updated construct of ADHD assessment, while focusing on ways to enhance diagnostic accuracy in an efficient manner. 
Clinical testing of the PADDS Target Tests of Executive Functioning was conducted on one of the largest samples of age specific, ADHD and non-ADHD subjects collected, with 725 children (240 females and 485 males) age 6 to 12 years (M = 8.63, SD = 1.72) split approximately evenly between those diagnosed with ADHD (n = 395) and age matched Non-ADHD/ Typical peers (n = 330). Data were collected in seven states from a total of 10 data collection sites. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the overall project was established through Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia. All research sites included specialty ADHD assessment centers, each with independent IRB oversight, in Illinois, Georgia, Idaho, New Jersey, Tennessee, California, and Florida. Pedigo, Pedigo & Scott (2008).
Screening for possible comorbid conditions.
The Computer Administered Diagnostic Interview (CADI) is used for comorbid screening, to assist clinicians with the collection and consolidation of pertinent patient information. The clinical protocol consists of 113 questions covering the major domains of co-occurring disorders. These areas include a medical and developmental history, emotional/social functioning, depression and anxiety symptoms, behavioral issues, school history, and attention/hyperactivity symptoms. This information is necessary to help structure an individual assessment process and to support recommendations that might be generated. The information is reviewed, with the parent or guardian, for cross validation of any concerns presented.
Screening for inattention and hyperactivity.
The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham—IV (SNAP-IV) rating scale forms are included for parent / guardian and teachers to complete. 
The SNAP-IV rating scales offer categorical and dimensional input across the 18 core diagnostic items from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV Fourth Edition-Revised. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale for severity. These behavioral criteria when used in the ascribed manner have produced reliable sensitivity and specificity in identifying ADHD cases relative to non-clinical reference groups. (Power, T. J., Andrews, T. J., Eiraldi, R. B., Doherty, B. J., Ikeda, M. J., DuPaul, G. J., & Landau, S.; 1998)
Objective measures.
The Target Tests of Executive Functioning (TTEF) consist of three target subtests, Target Recognition, Target Sequencing and Target Tracking. They are designed to place distinctly different demands on several key areas of executive functioning that have been identified as important to ADHD assessment.(Biederman, J., Monuteaux, M. C., Doyle, A. E., Seidman, L. J., Wilens, T. E., Ferrero, F., Morgan, C. L., & Faraone, S. V.; 2004). The tests tap working memory, sequential memory and procedural memory functions, and help provide an objective assessment of a subject’s ability to employ various but not all executive processes such as planning, attending, organizing input, storing and retrieving information, modulating emotions and sustaining effort. These task demands have been consistently identified as areas of difficulty for children known to have ADHD.(Russell Barkley; 1997)
Task specific demands for target recognition.
Target Recognition takes approximately 8–10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents five large colored squares with smaller squares inside them. Below the squares are five small boxes labeled 1 to 5. The colored squares simultaneously blink on and off the screen at 1 ½ second intervals, in differing patterns for a total of 153 presentations. The child is taught a strategy to read from left to right and to count the number of large squares with small squares inside them of the same color and then to click on the corresponding number in the small box below labeled 1 to 5.
Specific requirements for task completion include among others:
Attention to detail, avoiding distraction, maintenance of effort or persistence, holding information in mind through the use of metacognition, feedback, and emotional regulation while developing a response to changes in novel stimuli.
Task specific demands for target sequencing.
Target Sequencing takes approximately 8–10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents five large colored circles. A small colored square moves through each of them starting in the middle or at either of the end circles. The child is taught to attend only to circles when the square matches it in color and to say the name of the color to him or her self while at the same time disregarding the circles that have squares with a different color. Once the squares have moved through all five circles the child clicks on each of the circles that had matching colors in the same order that they stated to him/herself. First match first, second match second and last match last.
Specific requirements for task completion include among others:
Attention to detail, avoiding distraction, maintenance of effort or persistence, holding information in mind through the use of metacognition, feedback, and emotional regulation during the initiation and follow through of a response to complex sequences while remaining sensitive to changes in novel stimuli.
Task specific demands for target tracking.
Target Tracking takes approximately 8–10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents four colored shapes at the top and bottom of the screen. The computer creates one move at a time two and three step moves that the child must repeat/recreate in the same order seen. First move first, second move second and last move last.
Specific requirements for task completion include among others:
Attention to detail, maintaining divided attention, holding information in mind, maintenance of effort or persistence and emotional regulation while completing complex two and three step instructions.
Scoring and reporting.
The PADDS System and Summary Reports presents the incremental input of multiple forms of information that research has shown to be most reliable and valid for ADHD assessment. (Frazier & Youngstrom; 2006). The PADDS system uses a comparison of two well-defined reference groups namely ADHD and Non-ADHD. Each component is calculated in additive or subtractive manner for and against a diagnosis in consideration of the ADHD Base rate. The inputs are displayed in a real time format via a computer generated Nomogram presenting an individual and an overall predictive index of likelihood ratios establishing evidence for or against a diagnosis. Results are likewise presented in a normalized, relative Standard score, T-score, Z-Score, and Percentile rank format for comparison to the non-clinical reference group.
The Nomographic display of the individual and cumulative inputs are evaluated stepwise via the calculation of likelihood ratios applied incrementally with a Fagan's Nomogram,(Fagan TJ ;1975) to produce an overall predictive index beginning with a calculated base rate, and combining the results of the other measures, in either an additive or subtractive manner, to provide a post-test probability. When these components are used in conjunction with clinical judgment they have proven to be highly effective for consideration of diagnosis, in highlighting and documenting a need for further evaluation or actions, and may allow the clinician to evaluate their own diagnostic practices and effectiveness over time.
Clinical use of the Pediatric Attention Disorders Diagnostic Screener (PADDS).
PADDS is used by: Child Psychiatrists, Child Psychologists, Neuro-psychologists, School Psychologists and Pediatricians
The PADDS is published by and available from Targeted Testing, Inc. and other major psychological test publishers.

La Diva (group)

La Diva is a Filipino pop girl group, first established for the show "SOP". The group is composed of two winners and a runner-up of "Pinoy Pop Superstar", namely Jonalyn Viray, Aicelle Santos, and Maricris Garcia. La Diva has sold more than 10,000 albums in the Philippines which has earned them several achievements, including an Awit Award, two PMPC Star Awards for Music and an Aliw Award, becoming the fourth best-selling female group in the Philippines behind the Sexbomb Girls, Aegis and Mocha Girls.
History.
In May 2008, it was confirmed that the GMA Artist Center would be forming a female music trio called La Diva. With its "Three of a Kind" segment, the musical variety show was ready to introduce a new generation of "divas".
Member Jonalyn Viray noted that a meeting for the creation of La Diva was held in January 2008, with the stipulation that each member of the group would still keep their own identity, for their solo careers. While the three ladies of La Diva are uncertain of how the group was formed, the combining factor is that each of them came from the singing competition, "Pinoy Pop Superstar". Viray and Maricris Garcia were the Grand Champions of the first and third seasons respectively, and Aicelle Santos was the runner-up of the second season.
During October 24–28, 2011, La Diva was invited to guest on three shows in Indonesia. They performed hits such as "I'm Yours" and "Empire State of Mind". On the show "Showbiz Central", it was reported and confirmed that La Diva were to begin an work on an international album.

The album contains 10 tracks including their own versions of the songs "Apologize", "Angels Brought Me Here", "I'm Yours", "Best of My Love", "Stand Up For Love", "Gaano Kadalas Ang Minsan" and their original songs, "Kasiping Ka" as their carrier single, "One Last Goodbye", and "Rosalinda".
Artistry and influences.
Musical styles.
On La Diva's debut album, the group was noted to have a distinct, mixed style of reggae, belting pop, novelty and dance. Thematically, La Diva's music explores independence and female empowerment, such as in songs like "Angels Brought Me Here" and "Best of My Love".
They have a blending of vocal styles; Jonalyn Viray being the soprano, Maricris Garcia taking the place of the mezzo-soprano, and Aicelle Santos as the alto.
Image.
La Diva is known for a "belting style" and them being "sexy". Sony BMG Philippines from the business label described La Diva as a pop group characterized by bold, bright outfits and big, catchy hooks punctuated by rap verses and an "in-your-face swagger".
Styles and themes.
La Diva has recorded R&B/novelty/pop songs with styles that encompasses urban, contemporary and dance-pop music. They have revealed that R&B female group Destiny's Child and fellow Filipina singer Regine Velasquez are among their influences.

Hakon Børresen

Axel Ejnar Hakon Børresen (June 2, 1876, Copenhagen – October 6, 1954, Copenhagen) was one of the foremost Danish composers of the 20th century.
Life.
Børresen was descended from a merchant family. As a child, he was given violin, cello and piano lessons. When Børresen made clear to his father that he wished to become a composer, the latter arranged for him to study at the Royal Danish Conservatory in 1895. There he studied composition with Johan Svendsen. After further private studies, his First Symphony was privately premiered in 1901. It made his name as an up-and-coming composer. There followed travels in Germany, France and Belgium, where he made many useful connections. From 1902 on he divided his time between Copenhagen and Skagen where he maintained a second home. Børresen was an important organizer of several Danish music festivals and served as the president of Danish Composers Union between 1924 and 1949. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as one of Denmark's most important musicians. His opera, "The Royal Guest", is widely regarded as the best early 20th-century Danish opera, and his chamber music works received considerable critical praise.
Tonal language.
Børresen's style and musical language are primarily that of the late Romantic. His music shows little or no influence from more modern tendencies. Instead, his music takes as its inspiration Danish cultural ideas and folk melodies. His style reflects the influence of his teacher Svendsen, as well as that of Tchaikovsky.

Onyeka Nwelue

Onyeka Nwelue (born 31 January 1988) is a Nigerian writer, filmmaker and cultural entrepreneur, described by Channel O as 'an unalloyed genius', who divides his time between Paris, France and Lagos, Nigeria.
Biography.
1988–2009: Early life and beginning.
Onyeka Nwelue was born in Ezeoke Nsu, Imo State, Nigeria. Throughout his youth, he aspired to be a writer and filmmaker. After joining school, he started painting and won competitions. He led the drama and debating clubs of his primary school. He was also a part of the youth choir of St. Paul's Cathedral Church, Ezeoke Nsu, before he was sent to the seminary. Considered to be very lazy by his family, he found strength in storytelling and painting and did so well in them. The son of a politician father, Chief Sam Nwelue (also a Knight of St. Christopher), and school-teacher mother, Mrs Kate Nwelue, also an Anglican Lay Reader and cousin to notable Nigerian writers Flora Nwapa and Chukwuemeka Ike. He is cousin to young Nigerian entrepreneur, Gerald Konwea. He lived in his village and attended Umunohu Primary School until he gained admission to Mount Olives Seminary, Umuezeala Nsu. He spent six years in the seminary, and in March 2006, at the age of 18, travelled to India to pursue a career in writing, living in the house of writer Abha Iyengar, before he became famous and made friends with writers and artistes of his generation, including Jyoti Guptara, one of the Guptara Twins, who was introduced to him by young Indian scientist, innovator and inventor of Glabenator, Apurv Mishra. His first novel, "The Abyssinian Boy", was written within the three months of his six-month stay in India, where he had gone to write, at the invitation of the India InterContinental Cultural Association (IICCA).
After graduating from seminary, Nwelue was to join Trinity College, Umuahia, but abandoned home and went to Lagos. From there, he travelled to India at the invitation of India Inter-Continental Cultural Association (IICCA), headed by Dev Bhardwaj, for the International Writers' Festival, after which he travelled to Delhi to live with the writer Abha Iyengar. However, life in India was very difficult for him. He began to work on a novel and needed help finding the true cultures of India.
In India he practised Hinduism, before turning to atheism. He wrote mainly on religion and sexuality, having met hijras on the streets of Pahar Ganj, where major parts of "The Abyssinian Boy" were set.
After the three months of his six-month stay in India, Nwelue finished the first draft of "The Abyssinian Boy" and sent it out to agents, claiming to have received over 45 rejection slips. Depression set in and it was time to leave India; he returned to Nigeria and got admitted into the University of Nigeria, Nsukka to study Sociology & Anthropology. Nwelue described those moments, as "those moments I needed validation from everyone. University education was trending, so if I must belong to the society, I must stay on one of the university campuses and pretend like I was adding something to my life." But after two years, he withdrew officially and decided to use the term "drop-out" because he believed it to be "fashionable". Within these two years, he had signed to DADA Books and was waiting impatiently to release "The Abyssinian Boy" and when it happened, he found a reason to move out of Nsukka town, keeping himself busy with his book tour in different states of Nigeria.
The launch of "The Abyssinian Boy" took place at the National Library, Yaba, Lagos, and was attended by politicians, writers, actors and relatives. Newspapers hailed Nwelue's first book as "out-of-the-box", and Indians in Nigeria praised him for capturing the Indian ethos properly.
Prior to "The Abyssinian Boy"'s release, some pundits had expressed doubts that the book would be successful. However, after its release, "The Abyssinian Boy" went on to become a critical and commercial success. Nwelue's portrayal of Indians was lauded by Indians themselves. Smitha Radhakrishnan from "Asia Pacific Arts" commented: “Very fresh and unusual and completely out-of-the-box.” Notable Indian writer and journalist Shobhaa De called it "promising". Indian critic Vani Nethiar wrote: “The surface of "The Abyssinian Boy" pulsates with Indian and Nigerian ethos. The reader wonders whether the novel portrays the meaninglessness of racist criminality and parochial sentiments that run in the baser levels of any man’s consciousness.” Magazines and newspapers chose "The Abyssinian Boy" as “Book of the Week” for a very long time, making it a National Bestseller as sales went up. At the Abuja Writers’ Forum, he won the TM Aluko Prize for First Book and Ibrahim Tahir Prize for Fiction. He was immediately nominated for the Creative Artiste of the Year at the Future Awards 2010, for a first book. For the third time in 2012, he was nominated in the same category, which after he lost, went on Twitter to say to the organizers: “Please, do not nominate me again. Shows that I’ve not been doing enough. Next time, don’t nominate me, please.”
2011–present: Breakthrough.
Following "The Abyssinian Boy", Nwelue began work on his second novel, "Orchard of Memories", travelling to Hong Kong, where the book is set. He has described the book as “rants from two angry men, a Hong Konger and a Mexican, who are stranded at the airport in Doha, waiting for a connecting flight to Hong Kong.” According to Nwelue, the book is told in a different way. “It is a more difficult style I chose this time around. But I enjoyed writing it,” he explained further. In June, Nwelue travelled from Lagos to Lisbon and from Lisbon to Barcelona to sign at Pontas Literary & Film Agency, the biggest literary agency in Spain. Anna Soler-Pont of Pontas wrote: “Pontas has recently become the international literary agency for Nigerian author Onyeka Nwelue and we are convinced that he is an important new literary voice in English language.”
From editing "FilmAfrique", an new magazine published by Africa Film Academy, Nwelue got admitted into Prague Film School in Czech Republic to study Directing. He runs his company Blues & Hills Consultancy, with an office in Lagos.
Education and teaching.
In 2007, he was admitted into the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he studied Sociology and Anthropology briefly before dropping out to pursue a diploma in Scriptwriting at the Asian Academy of Film & TV, Noida.
After graduating, he lectured at NSS College, Ottapalam, in Kerala, southern India. Nwelue has spoken to students at City University, Hong Kong, Caritas University, Enugu, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, University of Nigeria, Enugu campus, Kaduna State University, Kaduna and taught in the "Nigerian Fiction" Class at the English Language Department, University of Lagos, as a Guest Lecturer. He has also taught Film Adaptation at the Centre for Research in Art of Film & TV, Delhi, where he was Writer-in-Residence. He also taught Screenwriting during the Film-in-a-Box, organised by Africa Film Academy in Lilongwe, Malawi.
Career.
Literary career.
Nwelue started writing at the age of eleven, as soon as he was admitted to the seminary. He wrote "The Talkative Monkey and the Rabbit", which appears in a chapter of "The Abyssinian Boy".
He won the Thomson Short Story Prize in 2000. He rose to fame with his appearance at the Wole Soyinka Festival in 2004, after which Nwelue was described in "The Guardian" as "a teenager with a steaming pen".
After he finished at the seminary, he received an invitation from the India InterContinental Cultural Association (IICA) to attend the 2nd International Writers Festival – India, that took place in several Indian states in 2006. Thereafter, he stayed in India to write, travelling to different parts and living with one of India's most celebrated authors, Abha Iyengar. Nwelue's completed manuscript was sent out to agents and publishers in 2006 and he claimed to have received over 45 rejection slips, before DADA Books publisher Ayodele Arigbabu called from Cape Town offering to publish the book. Many months later, a contract was signed and "The Abyssinian Boy" was published. Nwelue was rumoured to have been paid an advance of over N2.5 million for the book, which neither he nor his publisher have denied.
Nwelue is a founding member of DRUMLINE, a select group of creative young people at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, who were focused on creating and organising events. They also published a newspaper, "DRUMLINE", which folded after unsuccessful calls for sponsors. A few months after that, Nwelue officially withdrew from the university to become the Founder/chief executive officer of Blues & Hills Consultancy, an arts agency that champions the promotion of arts.
Danish filmmaker and visual artist Lasse Lau sought for the film rights to "The Abyssinian Boy" three months after its publication, but there was no proper agreement between KRAN Film and DADA Books; Nwelue got signed to Pontas afterwards. Lau and Nwelue met during an arts exhibition entitled "Maps: The World is Flat", organised by Kowry Kreations in collaboration with Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA), owned by veteran visual arts promoter, Bisi Silva.
Nwelue has been published in "The Guardian", "Times of India", "NEXT", "Punch", "Daily Times," "The Sun", "Vanguard", "ThisDay", "Ecletica Magazine", "Kafla InterContinental", "Wild Goose Poetry Review", "Maple Tree Literary Supplement", "Insurance & Money Weekly" and other publications.
He was the editor of "FilmAfrique", a new film magazine published by Africa Film Academy, curators of the African Movie Academy Awards.
"The Abyssinian Boy".
"The Abyssinian Boy" is about a South Indian Tamil Brahmin essayist and his East Nigerian Christian wife and the hallucination their nine-year-old child faces. The book, published in 2009, has received considerable critical acclaim from media sources like "The Guardian", "NEXT" and notable Nigerian writers, like Jude Dibia, Chika Unigwe and Nnorom Azuonye.
Shobhaa De described "The Abyssinian Boy" as "promising" and wrote on her blog that it was the novel she had travelled to Poland with, to keep herself busy. Amit Chaudhuri has praised Nwelue as a "very talented young author". And Hong Kong-based Sri Lankan writer Nury Vittachi has described him as "African literary wonder-kid".
"The Abyssinian Boy" was published in India in 2011 by Serene Woods. It won the TM Aluko Prize for First Book and came second at the Ibrahim Tahir Prize for Fiction, all in 2009, organised by Abuja Writers' Forum (AWF).
Nwelue is signed to Pontas Literary & Film Agency based in Barcelona, Spain.
"Orchard of Memories".
"Orchard of Memories" is Nwelue's second novel, the story of a Chinese man living in Lagos and a Mexican musician. It is set in Lagos, Hong Kong, Mexico City and Doha International Airport. Nwelue travelled to Hong Kong and walked the streets to get a feel for the book. "Orchard of Memories" will be represented by Pontas Literary & Film Agency.
"Burnt".
Burnt is a narrative in verse. British-Hungarian poet, George Szirtes describes the collection as " a breathless series of vignettes, anecdotes and narratives." It explores abuse, dogma, tangled relationships and a love for hypnotic cities.
"The Peace Symphony".
To be released on 20 April, The Peace Symphony is based on Peace Anyiam-Osigwe, the chief executive officer of the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It is a personal view of her, by Nwelue, who has worked and lived closely with Ms Anyiam-Osigwe for years.
Filmmaking career.
After training at the Asian Academy of Film & TV, Nwelue travelled to Oguta in Imo State, the birthplace of his mother, to film a story in 2011 based on the anthropological finds of German anthropologist, Sabine Jell-Bahlsen, who had spent over 26 years in Oguta, writing about Ogbuide, the river goddess. The film was called "The Distant Light" and there was a media buzz about it. It has not been released yet. His documentary on sex workers, "A Night with the Angels", has been hailed as a daring work. It chronicles the story of three colleagues who go out at night to hang out with prostitutes. He has made cameo appearances in movies, including one in multiple-award-winning director Kunle Afoyalan's recent film, "Phone Swap". He has also interviewed some of the heavyweights of the cinema world.
Nwelue co-created an idea for a short film, "The Beginning of Everything Colourful", with British actor and model Dudley O'Shaughnessy. The script was co-written with Ebuka Njoku, a student of Theatre Arts and Film Studies Department at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. It was shot in Paris. The music video of Casey's "Follow You" was also directed by him.
Controversies.
Nwelue has been the subject of various controversies owing to his outspoken nature. He legally dropped the name "George" in 2008 because of his atheist beliefs and for the fact that "I didn't understand the name George". In 2009, in a newspaper interview, he claimed that "Soyinka writes bad dialogue" even though he acknowledges the Nobel laureate as one of his mentors. In February 2011, at a lecture he delivered at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi, India, he dropped a bombshell when he declared "Things Fall Apart", by the legendary Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, was "the worst book ever written by an African". He also went on to describe fellow Nigerian writer, the equally famous Chimamanda Adichie, as "a nuisance to African literature", saying that she was only seeking relevance by connecting herself with Achebe. He posited that both "Things Fall Apart" and "Half of A Yellow Sun" should be banned in Indian universities and colleges since they presented poor, one-dimensional images of Africa and implored more non-Africans to read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". The video of the speech is on social network YouTube. In the video, he also added that Adichie's first book, "Purple Hibiscus", was one of the best books he had ever read in his life.
An open letter written to the Abuja Writers' Forum in 2010 caused much controversy in Nigeria and was published in major national dailies and several online media. In it, Nwelue accused the leadership of the writers' body of not having paid his prize money for the two prizes they awarded him late in 2009. Till date, the money has not been paid. Another open letter to the Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, comparing him to Zimbabwean ruler Robert Mugabe, was published later that year after Nwelue had met Mugabe's daughters who were schooling in Hong Kong on one of his trips. It caused so much buzz and sections of the public criticized the president for the poor Nigerian educational sector. Later in 2010, Nwelue released a controversial list of the Most Influential Nigerians Under 20. Published in online and print media in Nigeria and neighbouring Ghana, the list was received with mixed reactions. It included singers Jon Ogah, Whizkid, Mo'cheddah, writers Chibundu Onuzo and Chizitere Ojiaka, writer and motivational speaker Mervis Emelife and celebrity gossip journalists Sheifunmi and Noble Ezeala. Entrepreneur and essayist Aboyeji Iynoluwa and writer, journalist and self-styled mediapreneur Eromo Egbejule were also on the list.
In January 2013, Nwelue's Facebook, "An Open Letter to Tonto Dikeh by an Angry Igbo Man", which was lifted without his permission by one of his fans, was published widely. He crictized Nollywood actress and singer Tonto Dikeh for insulting "men of his tribe". He was praised by those who despise Ms Dikeh and considered as the best satirist ever.
After the release of the award-winning film "Mirror Boy", written and directed by Obi Emelonye, the Nigerian filmmaker came under scrutiny for what some bloggers called a "poor imitation" of Nwelue's "The Abyssinian Boy". In an interview with Ghanaian journalist and blogger Ameyaw Debrah, Nwelue said: "Obi Emelonye hasn’t denied that knowledge of my book, but rather he has denied reading it; which I think is very interesting. There are so many stories with children and dwarfs. There are many stories like that. But my fear is that Danish filmmaker Lasse Lau has a script that he’s going to shoot and it is the same way the adaptation has taken shape. The fear is that when people see "The Abyssinian Boy" film, they would totally assume it is a remake of "The Mirror Boy".” Nwelue's publisher, DADA Books refused to sue.
Nwelue is believed to practice Satanism and has been tagged occultist, owing to his atheist views in a religious country like Nigeria. He has also confessed to have worshipped Ogbuide, the Oguta Lake goddess of Imo State, Nigeria, for reasons known to him. He has also written extensively on the Rosicrucian Order, Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), having fictionalised them in his debut novel, "The Abyssinian Boy". His incessant attacks on Islam and Christianity have put him in spotlight. His website was hacked into and shut down by an Islamic group, after he wrote an open letter condemning the bombing of churches by Muslims in Nigeria. He has received threat messages, both from Christians and Muslims.
Grants, awards and festivals attended.
Nwelue received a grant from the Institute for Research on African Women, Children and Culture (IRAWCC), an organisation founded by former Nigeria's Mines and Steel Development Minister, Professor Leslye Obiora, to "empower young people". In 2010, he was nominated as Creative Artist of the Year at The Future Awards. He has been nominated thrice for the award, in the same category. He has been invited and participated at the 2nd International Writers' Festival – India, Jaipur Literature Festival, Man Hong Kong International Literary Festival- Hong Kong, DSC South Asian Literary Festival – UK, SWITCH Conference – Portugal, Creative Industries Session – Serbia and Lagos Book and Art Festival.
In 2000, he won the Thomson Short Story Prize. He won the TM ALUKO Prize for First Book and came second at the Ibrahim Tahir Prize for Fiction, all in 2009, organised by the Abuja Writers' Forum (AWF). He was Visiting Fellow at Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) in Cochin, Kerala, and was a Visiting Lecturer at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi. He became the first African to join Sandbox, a global community of young innovators under 30. He has read poetry at clubs and bars in Lisbon, Paris and Lagos. His collection of poems, "I Will Die When I Want", is due out in 2013.
In 2013, Nwelue became a recipient of Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development and participated at panels discussing Nollywood at the Lille Black Film Festival in France, alongside Nadia Denton, Dorah Ilunga and Maik Dwara.

His firm organised the first and second editions of Bayelsa Book and Craft Fair, at which he worked as the Director in 2011. The second edition was described by so many writers as an "epic failure", which Nwelue publicly stated was a "monumental failure and was taking responsibility of anything that went wrong". He has worked with celebrities like Dudley O'Shaughnessy, Davido, Casey, Nwachukwu Uti, Okey Uzoeshi, OC Ukeje, Terry Pheto, Ogah Brothers, p.R Twins, Nse Ikpe Etim, Nneka and many more on different capacities.

Insane Woman

Insane Woman is an 1822 oil on canvas painting by Théodore Géricault in a series of work Géricault did on the mentally ill. It is housed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, France. 
Mental aberration and irrational states of mind could not fail to interest artists against Enlightenment rationality. Géricault, like many of his contemporaries, examined the influence of mental states on the human face and shared the belief, common in his time, that a face more accurately revealed character, especially in madness and at the moment of death. He made many studies of the inmates in hospitals and institutions for the criminally insane, and he studied the heads of guillotine victims.
Géricault's "Insane Woman", her mouth tense, her eyes red-rimmed with suffering, is one of several portraits he made of the mentally ill that have a peculiar hypnotic power. These portraits present the physical facts with astonishing authenticity, especially in contrast to earlier idealized commissioned portraiture.

Delyo

Delyo (, sometimes Делю, "Delyu") was a Bulgarian rebel leader ("hajduk voivode") who was active in the Rhodope Mountains in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
Delyo was born in Belovidovo (today Zlatograd) in the Smolyan region in the 17th century. He headed an armed detachment of rebels in the central Rhodopes and acted against the Ottoman authorities' Islamization of the local Bulgarian population. In 1720, he led a group of united rebel detachments that attacked Raykovo (today a neighbourhood of Smolyan) in revenge for the murder of 200 locals who refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. Delyo was mentioned in "Historical notebook", an 18th-century document of disputed authenticity.
Delyo is a popular character in Rhodopean folk songs and legends. He is presented as a protector of the local population and an opponent of the local Ottoman authorities. He is glorified as being unkillable by a standard sword or gun, so his enemies cast a silver bullet in order to murder him. According to the legends, Delyo was the son of a poor craftsman and was taught tailoring by his uncle in Enidzhe (Giannitsa), but upon getting to know Bulgarians from around Gyumyurdzhina (Komotini), he organized a rebel detachment to counter the Ottoman atrocities.
The most popular folk piece about Delyo is "Izlel e Delyo haydutin" ("Delyo the hajduk has gone out"), a song from the Central Rhodopes that has been recorded in various versions. The song is best known as performed by Bulgarian folk singer Valya Balkanska. It was launched into space in 1977 as part of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes' Golden Record which includes a multicultural selection of music.

La Lingerie

La Lingerie (内衣少女, "Noi Yee Siu Nü") is a 2008 Hong Kong film written and co-directed by Chan Hing-Kai and Janet Chun, and is a loose follow-up to Chan's 2001 debut "La Brassiere". Stephy Tang heads the film's ensemble cast, which also includes Janice Man, J.J. Jia, Kathy Yuen and Ronald Cheng.
Plot.
Aspiring designer Miu Ho is hired as a "Lingerie Researcher", and is given the task of finding out how lingerie makes the woman, or in some cases, the other way around. After her aunt Lara unexpectedly passes away, Miu and her cousin Donut inherit a spacious, fully furnished apartment filled with designer lingerie. The two girls live upstairs from Celine, a gold digging flight attendant who has had items of underwear stolen by a mysterious thief, and after reporting the incident to the authorities becomes involved with part-time police officer James Shum. Donut works in a lingerie shop, and is involved with a much older married man, Henry, who buys her a pink bra as his first gift. Bargirl CC is a customer at Donut's shop, and after meeting Harvard student Eugene believes that she may have found true love.
Still a virgin, Miu is determined not to end up like her unmarried aunt Lara, and resolves to find her first love. Her new colleagues warn her about the office lothario, marketing manager Lucas, but after a failed attempt to bed her the two instead become friends. Lucas tries to teach Miu how to attract men, which leads to a number of encounters with potential suitors, including sperm bank worker CY and writer Jack Dee. Eventually she ends up in a relationship with "Prince" Antonio, the narcissistic heir to her company, but an increasingly jealous Lucas realises that his feelings for Miu are genuine after all.
Development.
Written and co-directed by Chan Hing-Kai and Janet Chun, "La Lingerie" has its roots in Chan's 2001 debut, "La Brassiere". Speaking of that film, Chan said that although "did a lot of research, especially on the female side... we only took the point of view of men!" In order to redress the imbalance, Chan and his colleagues decided to make a film that gave "the female point of view about underwear", though the story changed several times before settling on four young women who hang out in a lingerie shop. He denied that the film had been inspired by the success of "Sex and the City", saying that he had yet to finish watching the show's first season. Actress Gigi Leung, who starred in both "La Brassiere" and its 2002 sequel "Mighty Baby", reprised her role as Lena in a cameo appearance.
Release.
"La Lingerie" opened in Hong Kong on 8 August 2008—the same day as the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympics—though director Chan did not regard the timing as a problem. On its opening weekend the film was ranked third at the local box office, grossing US$398,512. By the end of 2008, the film had grossed a total of US$1,094,497 at the Hong Kong box office with an additional US$143,068 at the Malaysian box office, making a total gross of US$1,237,565.
Critical response.
"Love HK Film.com" regarded the film as neither "exceptional nor an accomplishment", but commented, "The whole 'underwear as metaphor' theme is rather thin, but as fodder for gags and oddball characters, it works... For a two-hour Hong Kong-specific urban comedy, "La Lingerie" is enough to entertain." Gabriel Chong of Singaporean website "moveXclusive.com" was more critical of the film, finding it "stale and not even mildly funny" and saying, "what this all amounts to are artificially concocted emotions that basically are just as hollow as the multiple characters here... Coming from Chan Hing-Kai who’s proven to be capable of much better, this is nothing less than a disappointment."

Josip Kopinič (Nom de guerre: "Vokšin, Aleksandar, Vazduh, Valdes"; 18 February 1911 in Radoviči, Slovenia – 26 May 1997 in Ljubljana)
In 1931 Kopinič joined the Communist Party of Slovenia (KPS), and shortly later was sent to Moscow. In 1936 he was sent by the Comintern as "military counsellor" to help the Republic as the Spanish Civil War started. There he became commander of the Spanish Republican Navy yard at Cartagena. Then, from 1936 to 1938 he served on the republican submarine flotilla. Together with I. A. Burmistrov and N. P. Yegipko, Kopinič, in spring 1938, Kopinič participated to the hazardous journeys which their submarines made from France, where they had been repaired, along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula through the Straits of Gibraltar to Cartagena, i.e., a route almost entirely controlled by the nationalist forces.
After the Spanish Civil War Kopinič stayed in Paris as Spanish republican diplomat, provided also with a Soviet passport. During World War II Kopinič headed the chief Soviet intelligence center in Zagreb and was instructed by the Comintern to establish a new party organization independent from the KPJ.
Kopinič set up a radio-transmitter in Zagreb in 1940 which become the major information point between the Italian and Greek communist parties and the Comintern in Moscow. Also for this reason, it seems, the KPJ preserved pre-eminence in the Southeastern European region, backed by the Comintern. That lasted up to the Cominform Resolution of 28 June 1948 (resulting from the Tito–Stalin split).
From 1946 to 1949 Kopinič was in Turkey but nothing is known about this period except that he continued to work as a Soviet intelligence officer. Following the Tito–Stalin split Kopinič returned to Yugoslavia. In 1951 he became director of the Uljanik shipyard in Pula, where he stayed until his retirement.

Rancho Santa Gertrudes

Rancho Santa Gertrudes was a 1834 Mexican land grant, in present day Los Angeles County, California, resulting from a partition of Rancho Los Nietos. A former site of Nacaugna, the rancho lands included the present day cities of Downey and Santa Fe Springs.
History.
At the request of Manuel Nieto heirs, governor José Figueroa in 1834, officially declared the Rancho Los Nietos grant under Mexican rule and ordered its partition into five smaller ranchos: Las Bolsas, Los Alamitos, Los Cerritos, Los Coyotes, and Santa Gertrudes.
Josefa Cota (widow of Antonio Maria Nieto, son of Manuel Nieto) received the Rancho Santa Gertrudes grant. Lemuel Carpenter (1808–1859), who had married Maria de Los Angeles Dominguez, a niece of Josefa Cota, bought the rancho in 1843 from Josefa Cota, his aunt by marriage.
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for part of Rancho Santa Gertrudes was filed Lemuel Carpenter with the Public Land Commission in 1852. Carpenter, who was deeply in debt to John G. Downey, killed himself in 1859. In 1859 the rancho was sold at a sheriff's auction to John G. Downey and James P. McFarland. of the grant was patented to McFarland and Downey in 1870. 
A claim for part of Rancho Santa Gertrudes was filed by Thomas Sanchez Colima with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and of the grant was patented to Thomas Sanchez Colima in 1877.

Nallur Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between March 1960 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Nallur in Jaffna District, Northern Province. The district was carved out of the eastern part of Jaffna Electoral District in March 1960. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts.

After three months of absence, Sivasithamparam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983.

Elm City Resident Card

The Elm City Resident Card is an identification (ID) card used in New Haven, Connecticut in the United States. The card was originally designed to protect the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 undocumented immigrants in New Haven from being robbed or assaulted. All city residents can receive the card, which serves as a form of identification, debit card with a capacity of $150, library card, and a way to pay for parking meters. The cards were first issued in July 2007, and were the first municipal identification cards issued in the United States. The card costs $5 for children or $10 for adults.
Background.
Illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and other Latin American countries, has been a controversial political issue in the US for many years.
Illegal immigrants in New Haven were often targets of robbery, and sometimes murder because they were less likely to go to police due to their immigration status. It is also harder for illegal immigrants to get bank accounts, causing some to carry around larger sums of cash.
New Haven has historically had a favorable policy toward immigrants. In December 2006, the New Haven police instituted a policy of not asking crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status, unless they were suspected of being involved in a crime - the first policy of its kind in Connecticut.
Planning.
Municipal ID cards were first proposed in 2005, as the result of a study conducted by the Junta for Progressive Action, an advocacy group, and Yale Law School students. The proposal received a positive reaction, but was not adopted. Then, in December 2006, the mayor of New Haven, John DeStefano, Jr., announced that he was reviving the plan. The city then redrafted plans, and in May 2007 unveiled the new Elm City Resident Card that has multiple uses, so that it would be useful to all residents of New Haven.
Approval.
On 4 June 2007, New Haven aldermen vote 25-1 in favor of accepting $250,359 in private funds from the First City Fund Corporation to fund the Elm City Resident Card.
Aftermath.
Immigration raid.
Two days after the card was unveiled in 2007, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 32 illegal immigrants in the city.
Immigration office raid.
In December 2007, 6 months after the plan was approved, federal agents from the Department of Health and Human Services raided the offices of the Community Action Agency of New Haven with a warrant for all documents from 2003 onward. The agents asked whether they had been given instructions about giving aid to illegal immigrants.
Other municipal ID cards.
On January 15, 2009, the city/county of San Francisco launched the SF City ID Card, a municipal identification card program modeled after New Haven's. New York canceled a plan to issue driver's licenses for illegal immigrants after strong opposition.
Opposition.
Just before the ID cards were approved, two groups - Danbury-based Citizens for Immigration Control and the North Branford-based Southern Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Reform - wrote and distributed flyers around New Haven criticizing the Card. The Southern Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Reform have also criticized the plan as hurting New Haven's workers who are legal residents.
Other critics argue that it will entice illegal immigration and undermine border security.
In early 2008, opponents filed a Freedom of Information request to make public the names, addresses and photos of everyone who has an ID card. On June 25, 2008, Connecticut's Freedom of Information Commission upheld the city's decision to reject this request and protect the privacy and safety of holders of the Elm City ID.

Criticism and controversy.
Guerrero's tenure at UCLA has been the subject of much criticism.
Alumni and fan websites such as Bruins Nation, Go Joe Bruin and others have been very critical of Guerrero's performance. They cite the lack of forward thinking and complain that the department is constantly in a reactionary mode.
Additionally, the recent hiring of Men's Basketball Coach Steve Alford raised many questions regarding how much vetting was done into Alford's past when it became known to UCLA alumni and fans that Alford had publicly supported former Iowa basketball player Pierre Pierce who was accused of sexual assault and later pled to a lesser charge. When given the opportunity to properly address the scandal suring the second question of his introductory press conference at UCLA, Alford did not show any remorse, saying that "All I can tell you with that situation is I followed everything that the University of Iowa, the administration, the lawyers that were hired," Alford said, "I did everything that I was supposed to do at the University of Iowa in that situation." In response to criticism about this, Guerrero proclaimed that Alford "gets a clean slate" at UCLA. Nine days later, Alford apologized for his actions in the scandal via a prepared statement. Guerrero also issued a statement at the time. 
In response to the Alford hiring, fans and alums launched an online petition calling for his termination by UCLA Chancellor Gene Block.
Education.
Guerrero received his Bachelor's degree in History from UCLA in 1974 on a baseball scholarship as a second baseman. He earned a Master's degree in Public Administration in 1982 from Cal State Dominguez Hills.
Personal life.
Guerrero, who was raised in Wilmington, CA, was inducted into the UCLA Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Guerrero is married to the former Anne Marie Aniello and they have two grown daughters: Jenna and Katie. A Southern California native, Guerrero has been a very influential part of the community and one of Los Angeles' most charitable benefactors. Guerrero has contributed generously to many local foundations including the Chianti breweries.

L'Absent

"L'Absent" (English: "The Absent One") is a 1997 Canadian experimental film written and directed by Céline Baril.
The idea for the film was inspired by Baril's discovery in a Paris flea market of a dusty old photo album. Interior scenes, and all exteriors of European cities, including Rome, Vienna, Budapest and Prague, as well as glimpses (footage) of old B&W photos of a family, were shot in 8 mm and blown up to 16 mm for effect.
Synopsis.
This film tells the story of Paul Kadar, an architect and musician who, en route to Budapest, is overcome by vertigo while contemplating the Danube and throws himself into it. It is an account of the happiness shared by Paul Kadar, his wife Françoise
and Roland, their adopted son. Years later, Roland, still unclear as to the circumstances that led his father to drown himself in the Danube, heads to Europe to find out for himself. His journey takes him to such places as Budapest, Warsaw, Prague and even as far as Tokyo.
Reception.
In August 1997, Brendan Kelly of "Variety" wrote, "With its snail-like pacing, sub-par acting and underwhelming emotional impact, "The Absent One" is not likely to stir up much interest," and concludes with "Baril moves what little story there is along at an extremely slow speed, further straining viewer patience."

Blufflands State Trail

Blufflands State Trail is a paved multi-use rail trail system in southeast Minnesota. The trail system consists of two main segments, the Root River segment, and Harmony-Preston Valley segment. The trails are used mainly for bicycling, hiking, and inline skating in the summer, and for cross country skiing in the winter. Much of the trail, especially the Root River segment, is built along a former Milwaukee Road (Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad) railbed following the contours of the Root River valley.
The degrading quality of the trail's pavement has generated concern from both trail users and local business owners. The trail was originally paved in the 1980s, and asphalt trails are typically expected to last 15 to 20 years. As of 2008, some sections of the trail still feature the original 23-year-old asphalt. There have been reports of several injuries to cyclists caused by potholes in the pavement. The DNR has expressed sympathy, but places a higher priority on repairing closed trails than on repaving open trails. In August 2007, some parts of the trail were washed out by torrential rain. The damaged areas were temporarily repaired with gravel fill, and were repaved by June 2008.

Peruća Lake

Lake Peruća or Peruča ( or "") is the second artificial lake in Croatia after Lake Dubrava. It is located in the Split-Dalmatia County.
Location.
Located in inland Dalmatia, south of the source of the River Cetina, northeast of the State route D1 between the towns of Sinj and Vrlika.
The Lake is on the course of the River Cetina, bounded by Svilaja mountain to the southwest and Dinara mountain to the northeast.
Building of the dam.
The Lake is fed by water from the Cetina River, and drains an area of 3,700 km², while the total catchment area of the Cetina is around 12,000 km2. The annual discharge is around 105 m3 s−1 as a consequence of a mean annual rainfall of 1380 mm. This is why the artificial lake was created by building a dam on Cetina River in 1958, some 25 km downstream. The Peruća lake was the first large reservoir created in karst and the first remote reservoir in the Cetina Hydropower System. The reservoir was impounded in the Cetina canyon upstream of the Hrvatačko Polje ("field") by the construction of the 63 m high Peruća earth dam and grout curtain. The Peruća lake reservoir active storage is about 37% of the mean annual inflow, and it considerably affects the Cetina flow regulation at the downstream power plants between Sinjsko Polje ("field") and the Adriatic. The head concentration which is the result of Peruća Dam construction is used by the Peruća Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Peruća lake reservoir's active storage is 565 million m3 at the maximum operating level at an elevation of 361.50 m.a.s.l. The maximum reservoir flood level is 362.00 m.a.s.l. This was considered a great achievement at that time. The majority of the catchment drains calcareous are rocks of the Cretaceous period, predominantly limestone. Peruća lake is the third largest lake in Croatia by size. It is spread over 10–20 km², and is 60–70 m at its maximum depth, depending on quantity of rain/snow in winter.
Consequences.
Building the dam on the Cetina and creating the lake, has limited flooding downstream. Dalmatia has secured a greater energy supply. 
Before it was built, the State of SFRY nationalised land which belonged to the inhabitants of the neighbouring settlements of Vrlika, Garjak, Kosore, Ježević, Laktac, Dabar, Vučipolje, Zasiok, Bitelić, Rumin, Hrvace, Satrić, Potravlje, Maljkovo, Otišić and Maovice. 
In the middle of the lake, there was an old Orthodox Dragović Monastery. Before the artificial lake for the hydroelectric power station at Peruća was created, the Dragović monastery was moved to a hill not far from the old fortress at Gradina.
Croatian War of Independence.
The Peruća Dam was gravely damaged during the Croatian War of Independence, when on January 28, 1993, in the aftermath of Operation Maslenica, at 10:48 a.m., the dam was blown up in an intentional effort to destroy it by Serbian/Yugoslav army forces. They mined it with 30 tons of explosive and detonated the charges with the intention of harming thousands of Croatian civilians downstream. The explosion caused heavy damage, but ultimately failed to demolish the dam. The Croatian communities in the Cetina valley (from Sinj to Omiš) were nevertheless in great danger of being flooded by water from Peruća lake. The actions of the UNPROFOR officer Mark Nicholas Gray ("Major in the British Royal Marines") prevented the disaster at the Dam because before the explosion he had raised the spillway channel and reduced the level of water in the lake by four meters. This prevented total collapse of the dam and engineers were quickly able to maintain the integrity of the dam.
Subsequently, the Croatian forces intervened and recovered the dam and the surrounding area. On January 29, a small Croatian army team, supported by engineers previously employed in dam maintenance, verified that the main outlet valve could be accessed. It was accessible but stuck due to two years of neglect, loaded with 700 tons of hydrostatic pressure. The engineers then refilled the oil in the hydraulic pumps and used an UNPROFOR engine to restart them. This allowed for the lake to finally drain into Cetina, at a rate of 187 m3/s.
In August 1993, HEP started to repair the dam. The works on the dam were completed some time after the war ended, in May 1996.
In 2002, Colonel Gray was awarded the MBE (although not for his actions at Peruća). In 2011, Croatian President Ivo Josipović decorated four Croatian soldiers for valor in combat at Peruća. On 27 January 2013, the 20th anniversary of the HV recapture of the Peruća dam, Gray was awarded Order of Duke Domagoj by president Josipović.

The Haunted House of Horror

The Haunted House of Horror, also titled Horror House and The Dark, was an early type of teen "slasher film" set in late 60's England. It starred Frankie Avalon and Jill Haworth as young adults looking for a thrill by spending the night in an old mansion in the English countryside. Although portraying a teenager, Avalon was nearly 30 years old at the time of filming. It was directed by Michael Armstrong who would go on to direct "Mark of the Devil".
Plot.
In swinging London, a group of twenty-something friends are attending a rather dull party, and they decide to gather for kicks at an old supposedly haunted mansion where one of their number used to play as a child. Among the group is American ringleader Chris, his bored partygirl girlfriend Sheila, promiscuous Sylvia who has her eye on handsome two-timing Gary, and his "good girl" date Dorothy. Also tagging along are nervous, heavy-set Madge and her sarcastic, hot-tempered boyfriend Peter, and sweet faced Richard (who suggested going to the mansion), and his friend Henry. They are all followed by Paul Kellet, Sylvia's older jealous married ex-boyfriend.
They have fun exploring the mansion, even holding a seance before separating one by one by candlelight on the moonlit night. Sylvia, frightened by the mansion, leaves and hitchhikes toward home, but Kellet hangs behind at the mansion. While all the partiers are alone, Gary is brutally knifed; his body is discovered by the panic-stricken Dorothy and the others. Since some of them have a criminal record, Chris convinces the group to leave Gary's body far from the home and to pretend that Gary left and no one knows where he went. They are all shaken by Chris' assertion that one of them must be the murderer.
During the next few weeks, the survivors are possessed by tension and guilt, and after Gary is reported missing, they are further shaken by questioning from the police. Kellet confronts Sylvia, learning that she may have lost a lighter that could link them at the mansion. He returns there where he is also killed.
Dorothy calls the survivors together to ask to confess. However, Chris convinces them to return to the house to discover who among them is the killer before they all succumb to a gruesome death. Meanwhile, Sylvia is visited by the police again, and she discloses the location of the house after learning of Kellet's disappearance. At the mansion, Dorothy becomes hysterical, prompting several of the group to depart, leaving just Chris, Sheila, and Richard. While Sheila is out of the room, Richard recounts a tale of how he was locked in a basement for three days as a child and how he has a paralyzing fear of the dark or anyone he suspects will lock him away. Despite Chris' efforts, he is also knifed and Sheila is frantically chased around the mansion. Just as Richard is about to strike, the moon goes behind a cloud, bringing about his reversion to childhood and fear of the dark, thus saving Sheila as the police arrive.
Reception.
The film's box office performance was reasonable.

QPACE

QPACE (QCD Parallel Computing on the Cell Broadband Engine) is a massively parallel and scalable supercomputer designed for applications in lattice quantum chromodynamics. 
Overview.
The QPACE supercomputer is a research project carried out by several academic institutions in collaboration with the IBM Research and Development Laboratory in Böblingen, Germany, and other industrial partners including Eurotech, Knürr, and Xilinx. The academic design team of about 20 junior and senior scientists, mostly physicists, came from the University of Regensburg (project lead), the University of Wuppertal, DESY Zeuthen, Jülich Research Centre, and the University of Ferrara. The main goal was the design of an application-optimized scalable architecture that beats industrial products in terms of compute performance, price-performance ratio, and energy efficiency. The project officially started in 2008. Two installations were deployed in the summer of 2009. The final design was completed in early 2010. Since then QPACE is used for calculations of lattice QCD. The system architecture is also suitable for other applications that mainly rely on nearest-neighbor communication, e.g., lattice Boltzmann methods.
In November 2009 QPACE was the leading architecture on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. The title was defended in June 2010, when the architecture achieved an energy signature of 773 MFLOPS per Watt in the Linpack benchmark. In the Top500 list of most powerful supercomputers, QPACE ranked #110-#112 in November 2009, and #131-#133 in June 2010.
QPACE was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of SFB/TRR-55 and by IBM. Additional contributions were made by Eurotech, Knürr, and Xilinx.
Architecture.
In 2008 IBM released the PowerXCell 8i multi-core processor, an enhanced version of the IBM Cell Broadband Engine used, e.g., in the PlayStation 3. The processor received much attention in the scientific community due to its outstanding floating-point performance. It is one of the building blocks of the IBM Roadrunner cluster, which was the first supercomputer architecture to break the PFLOPS barrier. Cluster architectures based on the PowerXCell 8i typically rely on IBM blade servers interconnected by industry-standard networks such as Infiniband. For QPACE an entirely different approach was chosen. A custom-designed network co-processor implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs is used to connect the compute nodes. FPGAs are re-programmable semiconductor devices that allow for a customized specification of the functional behavior. The QPACE network processor is tightly coupled to the PowerXCell 8i via a Rambus-proprietary I/O interface.
The smallest building block of QPACE is the node card, which hosts the PowerXCell 8i and the FPGA. Node cards are mounted on backplanes, each of which can host up to 32 node cards. One QPACE rack houses up to eight backplanes, with four backplanes each mounted to the front and back side. The maximum number of node cards per rack is 256. QPACE relies on a water-cooling solution to achieve this packaging density.
Sixteen node cards are monitored and controlled by a separate administration card, called the root card. One more administration card per rack, called the superroot card, is used to monitor and control the power supplies. The root cards and superroot cards are also used for synchronization of the compute nodes.
Node card.
The heart of QPACE is the IBM PowerXCell 8i multi-core processor. Each node card hosts one PowerXCell 8i, 4 GB of DDR2 SDRAM with ECC, one Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA and seven network transceivers. A single 1 Gigabit Ethernet transceiver connects the node card to the I/O network. Six 10 Gigabit transceivers are used for passing messages between neighboring nodes in a three-dimensional toroidal mesh.
The QPACE network co-processor is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, which is directly connected to the I/O interface of the PowerXCell 8i. The functional behavior of the FPGA is defined by a hardware description language and can be changed at any time at the cost of rebooting the node card. Most entities of the QPACE network co-coprocessor are coded in VHDL.
Networks.
The QPACE network co-processor connects the PowerXCell 8i to three communications networks:
Cooling.
The compute nodes of the QPACE supercomputer are cooled by water. Roughly 115 Watt have to be dissipated from each node card. The cooling solution is based on a two-component design. Each node card is mounted to a thermal box, which acts as a large heat sink for heat-critical components. The thermal box interfaces to a coldplate, which is connected to the water-cooling circuit. The performance of the coldplate allows for the removal of the heat from up to 32 nodes. The node cards are mounted on both sides of the coldplate, i.e., 16 nodes each are mounted on the top and bottom of the coldplate. The efficiency of the cooling solution allows for the cooling of the compute nodes with warm water. The QPACE cooling solution also influenced other supercomputer designs such as SuperMUC.
Installations.
Two identical installations of QPACE with four racks have been operating since 2009:
The aggregate peak performance is about 200 TFLOPS in double precision, and 400 TFLOPS in single precision. The installations are operated by the University of Regensburg, Jülich Research Centre, and the University of Wuppertal.

Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative

The Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC) is a coalition of more than 1,000 organizations and individuals — employers, consumer and patient/family advocacy groups, patient quality organizations, health plans, labor unions, hospitals, physicians and other health professionals — that works to develop and advance an effective and efficient health system built on a strong foundation of primary care and the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model, an approach to providing comprehensive care for children, youth, and adults. The Collaborative is dedicated to advancing team-based, comprehensive primary care in parternship with patients and their families and serves as a broad-based national advocacy organization for the primary care patient centered medical home, providing information and networking opportunities to facilitate support for the PCMH. They are headquartered in downtown Washington, D.C.
History.
The Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative was created in late 2006, when several large national employers came together with the four major U.S. primary care physician associations in order to:
To achieve these goals, the PCPCC has created an open forum where healthcare stakeholders freely communicate and work together to improve the future of the American medical system. The Collaborative has developed model language for inclusion in health reform proposals to include the PCMH concept. It also acts as a key source for the continued education of congressional representatives, the federal and state governments, and individual practices on the PCHM model as a superior form of healthcare delivery.
Activities.
Having achieved significant success in getting the PCMH included as a foundational model of care in national and state-level health care reform efforts as well as in the commercial health insurance market, the Collaborative is now working with partners to obtain full-scale implementation so all patients and families can receive care in a PCMH. In order to realize this vision for modern, robust primary care services, the Collaborative is working to:
In addition to the work of the PCPCC, the Patient-Centered Primary Care Foundation (PCPCF) currently engages in education of the PCMH model through public conferences, webinars, policy papers, guides, and toolkits.
Member Organizations.
Today, PCPCC’s membership represents more than 1,000 stakeholder organizations and 50 million health care consumers throughout the U.S. split into two different tiers of membership.
Executive Committee Members
The PCPCC’s Executive Committee is a valuable group of members that provide leadership and work in partnership with PCPCC's Board of Directors and staff. Members represent a range of health care stakeholders, including health professional associations, employers, purchasers, health plans, health systems, pharmaceutical firms, professional associations and quality improvement organizations. Member benefits include access to exclusive leadership roles, events and organizational initiatives. Each member contributes annual dues that support the development of educational tools, publications and conferences. 
General Members
The Collaborative’s general public membership is free of charge and includes many benefits. General members are invited to join the Collaborative’s national weekly call and receive monthly updates on the work of the five Centers. Members also have free access to many Collaborative resources.

Baseball (drinking game)

Beer-Baseball is a drinking game in which players shoot a ping-pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in one of several cups of beer on the other end, doing so in a way combining beer pong and flip cup. The game typically consists of two teams of even numbers, one on each side of a table, and four cups set up on each side. The cups are lined up in a straight line representing the bases with the last cup at the edge of the table.
When a ball lands in a cup, the defending team must consume all of the beer inside that cup and all the cups below it, e.g. if the third cup is hit (a triple), the third, second and first cup are consumed. The cups are filled according to their position on the table. The cup closest to the opposing team is 1/4 full, the second cup is 1/2 full, the third cup is 3/4 full and the final cup nearest the edge is full. It is also common to have a glass of water with the purpose of cleaning the ball between throws. After consumption the cup is refilled to the appropriate level and placed back on the table.
The game consists of nine innings in which each team gets to "bat"; if a ball is thrown and does not hit or land in a cup this is an out; each team gets three outs per inning. The team with the greatest score after nine innings is considered the winner. Variation: the game can be played using "little league" rules in which the game is over after six innings.
Setup.
14 cups are needed, seven for each team, four representing the bases, then three on each side of the table representing bases for baserunners. The four cups representing the bases are lined up in a straight line with the last cup at the edge of the table. The cups for flip cup are placed near the center of the table so that judging who won the flip cup can be done easily.
Teams.
Baseball is usually played with two teams of even numbers, though it can be played by an odd number so long as the relative drinking/playing strengths are even. Each team begins with two captains who pick their team in an alternating fashion. The captain who picks second then chooses whether to be home (shoot second) or away (shoot first.)
Playing field.
The game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.
Equipment.
The most common cups used are 16 ounce disposable plastic cups with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. 
38 mm or 40 mm table tennis (ping pong) balls are typically used for game play.
Alcohol.
Usually an inexpensive light beer is used because of the large quantities of beer which may be consumed during the course of several games.
Game play.
Game play proceeds much like a game of beer pong. The team that is up shoots the ball until they accumulate three outs, via getting 3 strikes (by missing the cups), being caught out (which can occur when a ball bounces off a cup and the opposing team catches it), or being thrown out stealing. At this point the other team begins to shoot. After nine innings the score is calculated and the team with more runs wins.
AT BAT:
Four cups are arranged so that the farthest cup is touching the far edge of the table. The cups are arranged vertically and touching so that each cup is one cup's diameter closer to the person "at bat." The cups are filled with beer so that the "single cup" (being the cup closest to the batter) is filled 1/4 of the way. The "double cup" is filled to half. The "triple cup" is filled to 3/4, and the "home run cup" is filled all the way.
If a player lands the ball in a cup the opposing team must consume that cup and all cups below it, e.g. the second cup is hit (a double) so the second and first cup are consumed. The cups are refilled to the appropriate line and placed back in formation.
Each player gets three attempts (strikes) to get a hit (make the ball in one of those cups). A miss is one strike. The opposing team can field the batter out by catching a foul ball (as described above). 
BASE RUNNING:
When a player makes a cup they are said to be on base. Three cups must be set up as bases: The "first base" cup must be filled 1/2 of the way full; the "second base" cup is to be filled 3/4 full; the "third base" cup is full. A designated "catcher" from the fielding team must also have a cup that is filled to 1/3. A base runner advances to the base corresponding to his at bat. A single puts him on first base, a double onto second base, etc. There are two ways to advance a runner: the runner can advance by the at bat player hitting the ball (which moves him the corresponding number of bases) or by stealing.
BASE STEALING:
This means they are now playing flip cup against a person from the other team, a catcher. If the person on base wishes to advance (steal) they begin to play single cup flip cup. If the person on base wins they advance, if they lose they are thrown out, and are off the bases and an out is recorded. The person attempting to steal must not try to steal until the opposing team has set and refilled their cups, an attempt to steal before this is done is considered void and must be sent back to the original base. If the catcher lifts up their cup before the base runner lifts up their cup this is a balk and the base runner advances one base. If a player throws a ball that hits a cup and the opposing team catches it, it is a strike. Should a player throw an airball (the ball touches no cups or the table) and is caught, it is considered an 'out' The person catching must rotate by inning and no one can catch a second time until everyone has caught once.
If a person shoots out of order just like in baseball if caught the shooter is not out but the person that was skipped is out.
ALTERNATE RULES:
An alternate set of rules (known as "Man Lodge Rules") exists to make the game higher scoring, feel more similar to actual baseball, and make home runs more rewarding. In Man Lodge rules the gameplay is similar except:
1) Missing all cups but still hitting the table is counted as a strike, as opposed to an out
2) Bouncing the ball off a cup is treated as a foul ball, and if caught in the air is an out, if not it is counted as a strike (similar to actual baseball)
3) Missing the table entirely ALWAYS constitutes an out, whether or not the defense catches it
4) Each cup is filled halfway, once a cup is made you pull that cup and drink its contents, with the exception of a home run, in the event of a home run all remaining cups are consumed, and all cups are replaced.
5) If a player makes a "base" cup a player is currently drinking (similar to a "death cup" in beer pong) that is considered a "Grand Slam" - drink remaining cups and count 4 runs scored

William Mosley

William Ralph Mosley, Jr. (born June 22, 1989) is an American basketball center for Basket Ferentino in Italy's Legadue Basket. He played for Northwestern State from 2008–09 through 2011–12. He is best known for leading NCAA Division I in blocks as a junior in 2010–11. Mosley recorded a school single season record 156 blocks in 32 games player for an average of 4.9 per game. He graduated after 2011–12 as the fifth most prolific shot blocker in NCAA history after having accumulated 456 career blocks.
Early life.
Mosley was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He attended Huntington High School from 2003–04 to 2006–07, and as a senior he was named Second-team All-District 1-5A on a team that finished with a 34–6 overall record. The Raiders, as the team was known, was the second-ranked team in Louisiana's Class 5A. During his final high school season, Mosley averaged 9.2 points, 11.3 rebounds 5.2 blocks per game.
College.
Mosley stayed in his home state to play college basketball, although his collegiate career did not begin until 2008–09. That season, he ranked fourth nationally in rebounds per game (8.5) among freshmen and second in blocks per game (2.5). His 76 blocked shots placed him 10th all-time in Northwestern State University history while also ranking him second in single season totals.
The following year, his sophomore campaign, Mosley led the Southland Conference with 3.4 blocks per game. He recorded career highs of eight blocks and 21 rebounds en route to being named an Honorable Mention All-Conference selection.
In 2010–11, Mosley increased his statistical averages in most categories, most noticeably in blocks per game. He played in three more games than the year before but also increased his average by 1.5 blocks per game, and Mosley's 4.9 topped NCAA Division I. He had entered his junior year having already amassed 174 career blocks and needing 29 to become the school's all-time leader. After recording 156 during his junior year, and still having one full season left to play, Mosley has entered his senior season in 2011–12 as the school record holder by 127 blocks. When his college career ended following the 2011–12 season he had recorded 456 blocks. This total placed him fifth all-time on the NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaderboard.
Infant twin sons' deaths.
On March 3, 2012, Mosley's two infant twin sons, Jayden and Kayden Mosley, died after spending their entire lives in a hospital due to respiratory issues. The twins were born on March 20, 2011, and there was no apparent threat prior to their deaths.

Nicholas A. Christakis

Nicholas A. Christakis (born May 7, 1962) is an American sociologist and physician known for his research on social networks and on the socioeconomic and biosocial determinants of behavior, health, and longevity. As of July 2013, he is the Sol Goldman Family Professor of Social and Natural Science at Yale University. He directs the Human Nature Lab, and he is the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Science. Until July 2013, he was a Professor of Medical Sociology in the Department of Health Care Policy and a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School; a Professor of Sociology in the Department of Sociology in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences; and an Attending Physician at the Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital. From 2009 to 2013, Christakis and his wife, Erika Christakis, were Co-Masters of Pforzheimer House, one of Harvard's twelve residential houses.
Christakis is also known for his popular undergraduate lecture class "Life and Death in the USA" which is podcast publicly, and for attracting a diverse group of faculty and students from across University departments and professional schools into his research group.
In 2009, he was named to the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2009 and again in 2010, Christakis was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.
He was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in 2006, and he was named a Fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2010.
Early life and education.
Christakis is of Greek heritage.
Christakis received a B.S. in biology from Yale University in 1984, where he won the Russell Henry Chittenden Prize. He received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School and an M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1989.
In 1989, Christakis moved to Philadelphia, PA, where he completed a residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Health System and then obtained a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. While at the Penn as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar, he worked with Renee C. Fox, a distinguished American medical sociologist; other members of his dissertation committee were methodologist Paul Allison and physician Sankey Williams. In his dissertation, which was published as "Death Foretold", Christakis studied the role of prognosis in medical thought and practice, documenting and explaining how physicians are socialized to avoid making prognoses. He argued that the prognoses patients receive even from the best-trained American doctors are driven not only by professional norms but also by religious, moral, and even quasi-magical beliefs (such as the "self-fulfilling prophecy").
Christakis trained as a general internist. He completed his residency in 1991 at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1993.
Career.
Upon graduating in 1995, he was recruited by the University of Chicago, where he started as an Assistant Professor with joint appointments in Departments of Sociology and Medicine. Six years after arriving at Chicago, Christakis was awarded tenure in both Sociology and Medicine. However, in 2001, Christakis left the University of Chicago to take up a position as Professor of Medical Sociology at Harvard Medical School; in 2005, he was also appointed as Professor of Sociology in the Harvard Department of Sociology; and, in 2009, he was appointed as Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
In 2013, Christakis moved his lab to Yale University, where he is appointed as a Professor of Sociology and a Professor of Medicine.
Research.
Nicholas Christakis uses quantitative methods (e.g., mathematical models of network formation, statistical analysis of large observational studies, and experiments) to study social networks and other social factors that affect health. His work has spanned the fields of demography, sociology, sociobiology, behavior genetics, network science, and biosocial science. He is an author or editor of four books, more than 150 peer-reviewed academic articles, and numerous editorials in national and international publications.
Studies by Christakis and James H. Fowler suggested a variety of individuals' attributes like obesity, smoking cessation, and happiness rather than being individualistic, are causally correlated by contagion mechanisms that transmit these behaviors over long distances within social networks. Since then, other work in the Christakis and Fowler Labs has used experimental methods to study social networks, and has broadened to use many data sets and approaches. Christakis's Lab at has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and by the Pioneer Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and by other funders. In a TED talk [http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/nicholas_christakis_the_hidden_influence_of_social_networks.html], Christakis summarizes the broader implications of the role of networks in human activity.
In 2009, his group extended the study of social networks to genetics, publishing in "Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences" a finding that social network position may be partially heritable, and specifically that an increase in twins' shared genetic material corresponds to differences in their social networks. And in 2011, Fowler and Christakis published a follow-up paper on "Correlated Genotypes in Friendship Networks" in PNAS. In 2012, in a paper in Nature, the group analyzed the social networks of the Hadza hunter gatherers, showing that human social network structure has ancient origins. Christakis and Fowler (and others) have argued that social networks are deeply related to human cooperation.
In 2010, Christakis and Fowler published a paper (based on the spread of H1N1 in Harvard College in 2009) regarding the use of social networks as 'sensors' for forecasting epidemics (of germs and other phenomena), beginning a program of research to deploy social networks to improve health and health care. In another TED talk [http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/nicholas_christakis_how_social_networks_predict_epidemics.html], Christakis describes this effort and computational social science more generally.
Harvard has licensed some of the technology from Christakis's lab to a start-up company, Activate Networks.
Physician.
Christakis has practiced as a home hospice physician, taking care of home-bound, dying patients. In Boston, from 2002 to 2006, Christakis worked as an attending physician on the Palliative Medicine Consult Service at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2006, he moved to Mount Auburn Hospital, and in 2013, he moved to the Department of Medicine at Yale University.
Books and other writings.
Christakis's first book, "Death Foretold: Prophecy and Prognosis in Medical Care", was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1999.
Along with James Fowler, Christakis is the author of "Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives", published in September 2009. It was awarded the "Books for a Better Life" Award in 2010 and has been translated into nearly 20 languages. "Connected" draws on previously published and unpublished studies and makes several new conclusions about the influence of social networks on human health and behavior. In "Connected", Christakis and Fowler put forward their "three degrees of influence" rule about human behavior, which theorizes that each person's individual social influence can stretch roughly three degrees before it fades out.
Christakis has also edited two clinical textbooks published by Oxford University Press.
Christakis also contributes to popular media. He is a contributor to Edge, and recently argued there that the 21st century will see a new kind of social science. He has published opinion pieces with and without his wife, Erika Christakis, in venues such as "Time", the Financial Times, the New York Times, etc., about science and the policy implications of new scientific understandings.

Savoia-Marchetti S.64

The Savoia-Marchetti S.64 was a monoplane developed in Italy in 1928 specifically to contest the world duration and distance records. It was an unusual pod-and-boom design, with the empennage carried on two open truss structures that extended aft from the wings, similar to the arrangement used on the S.55. The powerplant was mounted on a set of cabane struts above the wing, and consisted of a single engine driving a pusher propeller. The cockpit was located inside the stubby fuselage pod and was fully enclosed. The S.64 made its first flight on 3 April 1928 with Alessandro Passeleva at the controls.
Record flights.
On 31 May 1928, Arturo Ferrarin and Carlo del Prete broke three world records in the S.64 by making 51 round trips between Torre Flavia (in Ladispoli) and Anzio. When they landed on 3 June, they had covered 7,666 km (4,791 mi) – a new world distance record over a closed circuit – and stayed aloft for 58 hours 34 minutes – a new world endurance record. Moreover, they also set the world record for top speed over a distance of 5,000 km (3,110 mi) of 139 km/h (87 mph). With the record attempt successfully concluded, an announcement was made that this was to be a proving exercise for a Rome–New York transatlantic flight.
The following month Ferrarin and del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, but across the South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio on the evening of 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within radio range of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160 km (100 mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100 km (5,030 mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188 km (4,500 mi) – the orthodromic distance between Montecelio and Natal – and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later. 
In 1930, a second, improved S.64, designated the S.64bis, set out to reconquer the duration and closed-circuit distance records that been broken since Ferrarin and del Prete's flight. Between 30 May and 2 June, Umberto Maddalena and Fausto Cecconi flew from Montecelio in a closed circuit and covered 8,188 km (5,088 mi) in 67 hours 14 minutes, establishing new distance and duration records. They were preparing to again contest the endurance record in the S.64 when the aircraft crashed into the sea off Pisa on 19 March 1931. Maddalena and Cecconi were both killed, along with their mechanic, Giuseppe Da Monte. The wreckage was too widely dispersed for the cause of the accident to be determined with any certainty, but the Commission of Inquiry suspected that the crankshaft may have broken, causing the propeller to penetrate various parts of the aircraft.
The achievements of Ferrarin and del Prete, and the S.64, are commemorated in Rio de Janeiro's Praça Carlo del Prete with a statue of del Prete and a 1:2 scale bronze model of the aircraft.

Please Don't Stop the Rain

"Please Don't Stop The Rain" is the eighth single by James Morrison, and the third from his second album, "Songs for You, Truths for Me". James Morrison co-wrote this song with Ryan Tedder, from OneRepublic, who also sings in the background vocals. The single was released on March 30, 2009.
Music video.
The music video for "Please Don't Stop The Rain" is available to view on Morrison's official Youtube channel. The video begins with Morrison walking in a hilly area. Half-way through the chorus, Morrison is suddenly walking through fog, with sparks 'raining' down upon him. This happens through the rest of the song, joined with several shots of a husky running around in the same foggy conditions.
Critical reception.
Mayer Nissim from "digitalspy" gave a mixed review for the single and gave 2 out of 5 stars. He says:
"The third single from James Morrison's platinum-selling second album Songs For You, Truths For Me doesn't stray too far from the template of his previous releases. Morrison's voice is fine enough and the production sounds sleek and expensive, but unfortunately the music itself is quite unmemorable.
Please Don't Stop The Rain' begins with a Coldplay-esque piano riff and an anaemic melody that improves little by the time it reaches the chorus. You're forced to look to the lyrics for a reason to keep listening, but the earnestness of each clumsy metaphor quickly tries the patience ("I can see the skies are changing, no longer shades of blue"). Morrison's pleasingly gruff tones deserve some decent writing to tease them out, but sadly this isn't up to the job".
Charts.
In the United Kingdom, "Please Don't Stop The Rain" made its debut at number 68 rising to 39 two weeks later. On the issue dated April 19, 2009, the song rose to #33, and the following week, it started to fall, going down to #34. The week after, the song fell to #42. However, despite not reaching the commercial success of previous singles, it has become a big radio hit in Britain.

Voluntary action

Voluntary action is an anticipated, but not necessarily conscious, goal-orientated movement. This psychological concept is part of cognitive psychology that is associated with consciousness and will. Voluntary action works with action effect. Action effect is when an individual has learned to associate a particular action with a particular outcome. Thus, voluntary action is demonstrated when one cognitively identifies the desired outcome and pairs it with the action it will take to achieve it. According to psychologist such as Tolman this concept is applicable to humans and animals alike. However, there are some criticisms to the theory of voluntary action. Psychologist Charles Nuckolls explains in his paper that voluntary action is based on the principle that we are in control of our own actions. He states that it is not known how we come to plan what actions will be executed.
History.
The concept gained recognition when it was discussed in "The Principles of Psychology" by William James in 1890. James states that, for something to be classified as a voluntary action, “the act must be foreseen”. Thus, it is opposite to involuntary action. To highlight the difference between the two, James gives the example of movement: the idea of movement is a voluntary action, however, the movement itself, once the idea has been formed, is involuntary. This is true provided the action itself require no further thought. Voluntary action stems from the fact humans and animals have desires and the wish to fulfill them. To do this, goals are developed and voluntary action undertook to achieve the goals. Some of the terms that James used to describe voluntary action – such as desire - are now outdated according to cognitive psychology due its introspective experience but the general concepts are still held true.

Dorset Island

Dorset Island is one of the Canadian Arctic islands located in Hudson Strait, Nunavut, Canada. It lies off the Foxe Peninsula area of southwestern Baffin Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region. It is serviced by an airport and a harbour.
The island was named after the statesman Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset.
Geography.
The island is long and wide, with its highest elevation above sea level.
On the southern end of Dorset Island, at an elevation of above sea level, the mountain, Cape Dorset, projects into the Hudson Strait. It is part of the Kingnait Range ("Kingnait", in Inuktitut, means "high mountains"). The cape represents the southern tip of the Foxe Peninsula. On September 24, 1631, Captain Luke Foxe named the landform "Cape Dorset" to honor his benefactor, Lord Chamberlain, Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset.
Kingnait Hill, at high, is located on the island's north-west side. The shorter Eegatuak Hill is located north of the cape, on its eastern side, rising above sea level, and exhibiting a distinctive bowl-shape surmounted by a cairn.
Mallik Island, directly to the north, is joined to Dorset Island by sand and boulders. A natural harbour exists in the peninsula formed by the southeast side of Mallik Island and the northwest side of Dorset Island with prevailing northwesterly winds at 10 to 15 knots, stronger in September and October. The anchorage may have heavy swell conditions and there is frequent fog during the navigation season of early August through mid-October. Ice break-up is around mid-July, and freeze-up occurs in early November. Winter ice thickness can be up to .
There are several other islands within 10 km, including Okolli Island and Sakkiak Island.
History.
In 1913, a trading post was established on the island by the Hudson's Bay Company. A Roman Catholic mission was located on Dorset Island during the period of 1938 to 1960.
The first discovery of the remains of Dorset culture was on Dorset Island. An ancient Paleo-Eskimo people, they flourished in this area for about 2,000 years, during the period of 1000 BC through 1100 AD. Present-day Dorset Islanders, Inuit who descend from the later Thule culture, refer to Dorset culture people as "tuniit" in their legends.
Community.
Across from Mallik Island, on the northern side of Dorset Island is located the Inuit hamlet of Cape Dorset (also named Kingnait). It is approximately north of the mountain cape bearing the same name. Because the people of this community are known for their artisanship, including drawing, printmaking, and carving, the community of Cape Dorset is commonly referred to as the "Inuit art capital".
Wildlife.
The island and its surrounds are frequented by Arctic wolves, polar bears, and Arctic fox, as well as caribou and Arctic hare. Seals appear regularly, as do beluga whale during their migration through by the island in October and April.
Peregrine falcons, snowy owls, ptarmigan and ducks abound. Ornithologists consider the island's cape a major entry way to the nesting area of the Blue Goose. In 1929, it was the departure point for naturalist Dr. J. Dewey Soper in his quest for locate the Blue Goose's Foxe Basin nest area.
Mallikjuaq Territorial Park spans both Dorset Island and Mallik Island. Notable for its Thule culture, Dorset culture, and Inuit archaeological sites that date back as far as 3,000 years ago, it is reachable by foot from Cape Dorset at low tide, or by boat.

West Stanley Pit Disaster

The West Stanley Pit Disaster, also known as the Burns Pit Disaster, was a coal mining disaster that took place in Stanley, Co. Durham, England, on 16 February 1909. It was caused by too much methane gas in the air which caused a single lamp to explode (this was never proven at the time and the exact cause of the explosion remains unknown. But at a later inquest in 1933 when the last two bodies were recovered, it was discovered that a lamp was used in the pit that should not be used in gassy pits and that could ignite gas in the surrounding area). 168 men and boys died in the explosion.
Ex-manager of Newcastle United F.C. Kevin Keegan's grandfather was in the Stanley pit disaster and was one of the few who got out alive. A pit-wheel memorial was erected at Chester Road in Stanley.It shows all of the people who died in that incident.
A memorial service was held in 2009 to mark the centenary of the disaster.

Real property tax reform was another of Merritt's priorities in the Texas House. In 1999, he authored a proposed constitutional amendment to cap property taxes. In 2005 he authored both a bill and a proposed constitutional amendment to bring property tax relief to Texans. In 2009, he again authored legislation to reform property tax appraisals and proposed a constitutional amendment to cap property appraisal increases at the rate of inflation.
In 2009, Merritt co-authored legislation to reform the state's franchise tax, exempting more small businesses. Merritt also authored or co-authored numerous bills to overturn and subsequently prohibit inheritance taxes in Texas in 2005 and 2003.

Children of Bodom

Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Roope Latvala (guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), and Jaska Raatikainen (drums). In total they have released eight studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.
The band's third studio album, "Follow the Reaper", was their first album to receive a Gold certification in Finland, and since then, all seven of the band's studio albums have acquired the same status. In Finland, Children of Bodom has released three consecutive albums that debuted at number one on Finnish album charts, and has also seen chart positions on the United States "Billboard" 200.
The band has incorporated many different musical styles, leading critics and fans to label them as melodic death metal, power metal, thrash metal, and early symphonic black metal and neoclassical metal. They are one of Finland's best selling artists of all time with more than 250,000 records sold there alone. They have often been referred as "The kings of Melodeath".
History.
Formation and early years (1993–1997).
Children of Bodom was formed in 1993 by guitarist Alexi "Wildchild" Laiho and drummer Jaska Raatikainen under the name of "Inearthed". Both musicians had known each other since early childhood and had shared an interest in heavy metal, especially death metal groups, such as Dissection, Entombed, and Obituary. Bassist Samuli Miettinen completed the initial line-up of the band. Inearthed recorded its first demo, "Implosion of Heaven", during August of the same year.
Samuli was the main composer of the band's lyrics for the two years that he took part in Inearthed, but his family moved to the United States in 1995, making it impossible for him to remain in the band. His last contributions to Inearthed were the lyrics of the songs from their second demo, "Ubiquitous Absence of Remission" which was the first time they worked with producer Anssi Kippo at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In this demo, keyboards were incorporated into the band's songs for the first time. In order to achieve this, both Laiho and Raatikainen played the keyboards separately, and subsequently mixed the recorded track with the other instruments. Laiho, who had previously only composed the melodies of the songs, assumed the role of the band's lyricist.
At the time, Raatikainen played French horn in a local big band, and during a rehearsal he met Alexander Kuoppala, a trumpet player and also a proficient guitarist. Shortly after the recording of their second demo, Kuoppala was invited to join Inearthed as a rhythm guitarist.
The bassist chosen to replace Samuli was Henkka "Blacksmith" Seppälä, whom Laiho and Raatikainen had previously known from school. Apart from playing the bass, Seppälä also often doubles as the band's backing vocalist. Also, the band recruited a musician to specialize on keyboards, whose name was Jani Pirisjoki. Both joined Inearthed in early 1996.
With this new line-up, Inearthed proceeded to record their third demo, entitled "Shining". This demo did not impress record labels any more than the previous ones had, and none took interest in the band. Despite their efforts, their music got little exposure and managed only to play at local events. As a last resort, the band decided to record an independent, self-funded album. Considering that none of the musicians had much money to begin with, it was an audacious move.
Laiho wanted to make use of the keyboards more effectively, but Pirisjoki was not attending rehearsals. Thus, he was fired and replaced by a friend of Raatikainen's, a jazz pianist named Janne "Warman" Wirman.
Wirman was the component which was previously missing from Inearthed. His presence allowed the band to assume the style which would later characterize Children of Bodom. With Wirman, the band successfully recorded their first album in 1997. Their debut, "Something Wild", was supposed to be released by a small Belgian label, Shiver Records, but second vocalist Sami Tenetz (from Thy Serpent) acquired a copy of their album through the hands of Kuoppala. They both worked for the same company at the time. Shortly after Inearthed signed this contract, Spinefarm Records' boss immediately became interested in signing them for a country-wide release. The latter deal was much more attractive to the band, since the Belgian label was offering them close to no help, to the point where they would have to distribute and sell the album themselves.
The band was required to create a new name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.
"Something Wild" (1997—1998).
"Something Wild" was produced, recorded and mixed by Anssi Kippo and Children of Bodom at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In an attempt to promote their band, they opened a show for Dimmu Borgir in 1997. Their success was such that a representative from the Nuclear Blast label shortly approached them with a contract for a European release, a deal which started on the subsequent year. "Something Wild" was officially released in November 1997, and for promotional purposes the band recorded a music video of the song "Deadnight Warrior". The video was directed by Mika Lindberg and had a slim budget of €1000. It made use of simple scenery, which consisted essentially of an outdoors location after a snowstorm. The band played for a couple of hours at night, with an average temperature of minus fifteen degrees Celsius.
Although Laiho is very critical of all of the music he has written, he notes that he dislikes "Something Wild" the most of all of his albums. When recording this album, Laiho had tried to mimic the style of one of his idols, Yngwie Malmsteen, which is why "Something Wild" is considered one of the most technical albums Children of Bodom have ever produced. Despite this, he still considers it to be their "most important" record, as it "put them on the map."
Children of Bodom's first European tour began in February 1998. They played with bands such as Hypocrisy (at such festivals as Under the Black Sun), The Kovenant and Agathodaimon, but suffered from the absence of Wirman, who was concentrating on finishing his studies. He was replaced by pianist Erna Siikavirta for the duration of the tour.
Months later, the band recorded two new songs again at Astia-studios with producer Anssi Kippo, entitled "Towards Dead End" and "Children of Bodom". The latter was included in a compilation by Spinefarm Records, which after being released remained on the top of Finnish charts for eight consecutive weeks. In late August, the band played the song "Forevermore" live for the first time during a show in Russia. This song was later renamed "Downfall".
Their second European tour occurred in September of that same year, but once more Wirman was not able to perform with them. Laiho's then-girlfriend Kimberly Goss (from Sinergy and formerly of Dimmu Borgir, Ancient and Therion) assumed the keyboards this time. By the end of the tour, Kimberly invited Laiho to join Sinergy, which at the time was still in its early stages.
"Hatebreeder" (1998–2000).
The second album, "Hatebreeder", was recorded between the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 by Anssi Kippo at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). It was originally entitled "Towards Dead End", but while in studio the members of the band opted for the current title. To create anticipation in Finland, the '"Downfall" single was released two weeks prior to the album's release. It was accompanied by a new music video, once more directed by Mika Lindberg. "Hatebreeder" ultimately topped the charts in many European countries. In July 1999, the success of the "Downfall" single and "Hatebreeder" allowed Children of Bodom to schedule three concerts in Japan with Sinergy and In Flames. During two of these concerts, the live album "Tokyo Warhearts" was recorded. In it the band managed to seamlessly reproduce and at times improve on their songs. This was a notable achievement for a band with only two albums recorded previously. Under their request, no overdubs were used on the recording of the concert.
"Follow the Reaper" (2000–2002).
For their next release, Children of Bodom decided to make use of Peter Tägtgren's Abyss studio in Sweden instead of the Finnish Astia-studio from Anssi Kippo where they had recorded all of their previous releases including the demos from Inearthed. The band wrote eight new songs for this album. While in the studio, they decided to include an extra track that was hastily composed and featured lyrics improvised by Laiho; that track would eventually receive the name of "Kissing the Shadows". The band gave the album the name of "Follow the Reaper" and recording sessions took place between August and September 2000; the album saw a worldwide release in late 2000. A music video for "Everytime I Die" was recorded by the Finnish director Tuukka Temonen shortly after.
"Hate Crew Deathroll" (2002–2004).
In February 2002, Children of Bodom began writing songs for their upcoming album, entitled "Hate Crew Deathroll". They returned to Astia-studio (Lappeenranta, Finland) to work with producer Anssi Kippo again. The session ensued during the months of August and September, and the album was released January 2003 in Finland. It remained on the top of the Finnish charts for a total of three weeks and subsequently became the band's first gold album. Eventually all of the band's albums reached this status and "Follow the Reaper" reached platinum.
On January 3, 2003, the Finnish Metal Music Awards were held at Tavastia Club in Helsinki. Voting was open to all the metal fans and was presented through the various media outlets that were working with the event's organizers. Children of Bodom was awarded Finnish Band of the Year.
Children of Bodom's first world tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the consolidation of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons right in the middle of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on the 16th of August.
"Are You Dead Yet?" (2004–2007).
After successfully finishing the world tour with Latvala — who then assumed a permanent position in the band's line-up — Children of Bodom proceeded to record and release the EP "Trashed, Lost & Strungout" and the single "In Your Face", which contained songs from their upcoming album and a parody cover of "Oops!... I Did It Again" by Britney Spears. In late 2005, the album "Are You Dead Yet?" was released, featuring a style different from what had been presented by the band on its previous works. Simpler and heavier guitar riffs were incorporated into Children of Bodom's sound, as well as elements from industrial music. Reactions from fans to the release were varied; however, the album remains the band's most commercially successful. It was awarded gold status in Finland and reached first place on the Finnish charts, 16th in Germany, 16 in Sweden and 17 in Japan. The next release of the band was a DVD-single for the song "In Your Face", which included the music video, backstage footage from the band and a live recording of the song "Sixpounder" at Wacken Open Air festival in 2004.
In June, Children Of Bodom was in front of 120,000 spectators, one of their biggest concerts on the last concert of the Böhse Onkelz. On the DVD of the concert, the Vaya Con Tioz was called, Children of Bodom were also with the song "Everytime I Die" represented.
Children of Bodom's live DVD "Chaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live" was released on December 5, 2006. It contains a recording of a live concert performed on February 5, 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden, with over 90 minutes of live footage. "Chaos Ridden Years" refers to a documentary featuring interviews with band members about the history of the band and footage of the band on tour. It also contains every official music video Children of Bodom has ever made, except for "Needled 24/7".
Guitarist Alexi Laiho was voted world's best guitarist of 2006 by Metal Hammer magazine.
In June 2006, the band embarked on one of their biggest tours: The Unholy Alliance tour, playing alongside Slayer, Lamb of God, Mastodon, In Flames and Thine Eyes Bleed. The bands toured the US through June and July and Europe through October and November.
On January 31, 2007, Laiho slid down the lane at a bowling alley after accidentally stepping over the foul line. He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours and a festival that they were slated to headline.
On March 31, 2007, the band's website released information on Laiho's condition stating that while Laiho's injury will never fully heal, it no longer affects his ability to play a guitar. The same notice also stated that the band had already written some songs for a new album and would start recording sometime later in 2007.
Children of Bodom was selected to replace Velvet Revolver for the Monsters of Rock festival, playing on the same stage as Ozzy Osbourne and Megadeth.
"Blooddrunk" (2007–2009).
From October to December 2007, Children of Bodom recorded their sixth studio album, entitled "Blooddrunk", which was released on April 15, 2008.
The album contained 10 songs including a cover of "Ghost Riders in the Sky."
Children of Bodom was featured on the Gigantour 2008 North American tour with Megadeth, In Flames, Job for a Cowboy and High on Fire. Children of Bodom was one of the first bands to be confirmed for Wacken Open Air 2008, where they performed alongside many bands including Iron Maiden, Sonata Arctica and Avantasia. Children of Bodom played at Donington Download on the 15th of June, playing a mixture of old and new songs. On March 8, 2008, Children of Bodom did their first ever UK signing event at the Zavvi music shop in Oxford Street, London. They signed copies of their new single "Blooddrunk" in CD, 7 inch and 12 inch vinyls, only 666 copies of the 12 inch vinyls have been made.

In September and October 2008, the band toured the USA supporting "Blooddrunk" with support from The Black Dahlia Murder and Between the Buried and Me. Testament also made a special guest appearance in the main support slot at the tour's New York City date. In November and December 2008, the band toured in Europe supporting Slipknot and Machine Head. From late January to early March 2009, the band also co-headlined the European tour with Cannibal Corpse with Diablo opening for them. On April 2, 2009, Children of Bodom embarked on the No Fear Energy Tour headlined by Lamb of God with main support from As I Lay Dying and themselves, and rotating opening slots with God Forbid and Municipal Waste, but unfortunately dropped off the tour a week before it was finished following a serious injury Alexi suffered after falling from the top bunk of his tour bus on April 26, 2009, after the show in Palladium Ballroom, Dallas TX. In addition to the injury, on May 8, 2009, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, Alexi and Children of Bodom were forced to quit playing after a few of their songs because of Alexi's previous injury. Laiho originally planned to continue touring despite his injury, but was forced to cancel last six dates when any efforts to alleviate the pain failed. All summer festival dates went down as planned and were unaffected by Alexi's injury.
In February 2009, Children of Bodom hinted at plans to release a cover album entitled "Skeletons in the Closet", which was released on September 23, 2009. They also admitted to being "lazy" when it comes to practicing and talked about plans to have more songs on future albums. The band embarked on a tour of South America and Mexico in September 2009. Support on the trek came from Amorphis. Also in September and October 2009 the band returned to North America to headline a massive, month-long tour.

<doc id="21566649" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21566649" title="NFL Draft Advisory Board">
NFL Draft Advisory Board

The NFL Draft Advisory Board (sometimes initialized as the NFLDAB) is a panel of professional football scouting experts who offer advisory opinions to college football players as to the likely level of demand for the players' services during the NFL draft.
Background.
The board was created in 1994 to assist those college football players who were eligible to continue playing NCAA football or enter the NFL draft. Although the NFL had begun permitting such "underclassmen" to apply for the draft in 1989, within a few years it was clear that commission-based sports agents had deluded many of them as to their likely demand by teams and future salaries. 76 of the first 165 underclassmen to apply were not drafted, and once a college football player has entered the draft, he is no longer eligible to play college football. Thus, it was important that such players understand whether they would likely be among the small number of players drafted, and what their salaries might be, before committing to the process.
Board logistics.
The board is composed of general managers and personnel directors from a number of NFL teams, along with the directors of the NFL's two scouting combines, BLESTO and The National.
The panel issues an advisory opinion that a player has potential to be picked:
or some range thereof. These apparently can include a specific opinion that a player will be drafted in the "third or fourth round" or "first or second round", which is usually known as a "first day" pick, because Round 1 is on the first day of the draft.
The Board has a fair track record that has successfully predicted pick placement for some underclassmen but not others.
Player's role.
167 underclassmen applied for an evaluation during the 2007-2008 season. Players typically submit their requests for a Board opinion by late December and, after receiving the panel's report, have until mid-January to decide whether to enter the draft.
The Board's written opinion is delivered confidentially to the player. While some of the draft-eligible candidates choose to disclose the results to their coaches or to the press, either fully or partially, others do not.
For some players, the Board opinion determines whether they enter the draft while for others, little heed is paid to the opinion. Some players are so sure of what the opinion will say that they do not even wait for it to arrive before deciding on their course, while others listen to their coaches' advice on whether to declare early.

Ungod

Ungod is the debut album released in 1994 on Columbia Records by the American industrial rock band Stabbing Westward. The album was recorded in six weeks of 1993 in Chiswick, England, and released in February 1994. With adequate album sales and touring with the likes of Depeche Mode a second album was warranted, "Wither Blister Burn & Peel". The guitar line in the chorus of the song "Ungod" was later used in Filter's song "Hey Man, Nice Shot." Stuart Zechman, who was also playing guitar for Filter at the time, took the riff and showed it to Stabbing Westward who ended up using it as well. The song "Nothing" appeared in the "Bad Boys" movie starring Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Téa Leoni, but was not featured on the official soundtrack album. The song also accompanied the credits of the film "Johnny Mnemonic" and was included on the film's soundtrack, along with the song "Lost". "Lost", "Lies" and "Can't Happen Here" were used in the film "Mortal Kombat", but Stabbing Westward refused to include it in the official soundtrack. The "Thread Mix" of "Violent Mood Swings" was included in the Clerks soundtrack.
Reception.
In 2005, "Ungod" was ranked number 425 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time".

W. A. B. Coolidge

William Augustus Brevoort Coolidge (August 28, 1850 – May 8, 1926) was an American historian, theologian and mountaineer.
Coolidge was born in New York as the son of Frederic William Skinner Coolidge, a Boston merchant, and Elisabeth Neville Brevoort of the Netherlands. He studied history and law at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, and at Exeter College, Oxford. In 1875 he became a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. From 1880 to 1881 he was professor of British history at Saint David's College in Lampeter and in 1883 he became a priest of the Anglican church.
In 1870 at the age of twenty he was made a member of the Alpine Club. Coolidge was one of the great figures of the so-called silver age of alpinism, making first ascents of the few significant peaks in the Alps that had not been climbed during the golden age of alpinism. On many of these climbs he was accompanied by his aunt, Meta Brevoort, and a pet dog, "Tschingel", given to him by one of his guides, Christian Almer. 
In 1885 he moved to Grindelwald, Switzerland, where he died in 1926.

Visions (Clearlight album)

Visions is a progressive rock album by Clearlight, released in 1978 on Celluloid / LTM Records in France. (LTM Records is specified on the cover, but the label says Celluloid Records.)
Clearlight's final album set off in yet another new direction: while previous albums incorporated a new age element blended with other styles, this one is primarily a new age album, reflecting the emergence of new age music as a popular genre. The album is mostly instrumental, but has one song with lyrics and another with spoken word, both in French. Indian instruments such as sitar and tablas are prominent. "Fullmoon Raga" expands upon musical themes from "Master Builder" from Gong's "You" album, blending Indian music with rock music. The album also incorporates Clearlight's usual psychedelic jazz fusion jamming.
This edition of Clearlight played only one concert (the first since its UK tour in late 1975), at the Olympia in Paris on April 8, 1978, with a variation of the album's line-up: Verdeaux, Malherbe, Lockwood, Mandin, Melkonian and Bouladoux plus Jean-Michel Kajdan (guitar) and Mico Nissim (keyboards). It was badly attended, putting a premature end to the project. This would be the last manifestation of Clearlight until a one-off performance in 1988.

<doc id="21566746" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21566746" title="Coach (baseball)">
Coach (baseball)

In baseball, a number of coaches assist in the smooth functioning of a team. They are assistants to the manager, or head coach, who determines the lineup and decides how to substitute players during the game. Beyond the manager, more than a half dozen coaches may assist the manager in running the team. 
Roles of professional baseball coaches.
Baseball is unique in that the manager and coaches typically all wear numbered uniforms similar to those of the players. Notable exceptions to this were Baseball Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack, who always wore a black suit during his 50 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Burt Shotton, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1940s, who wore a Dodger 200 cap and a team jacket over street clothes in the dugout. After the widespread adoption of numbered uniforms in the early 1930s, Joe McCarthy, another Hall of Fame manager, wore a full uniform but no number on his back for the remainder of his career (with the New York Yankees, then the Boston Red Sox). Coincidentally, all three men retired during or after the same season — .
Full-time coaches in professional baseball date to , when John McGraw of the New York Giants engaged Arlie Latham and Wilbert Robinson as coaches. By the 1920s, most Major League teams had two full-time coaches, although the manager often doubled as third-base coach and specialists such as pitching coaches were rare. After World War II, most MLB teams listed between three and five coaches on their roster, as managers increasingly ran their teams from the dugout full-time, and appointed pitching and bullpen coaches to assist them and the baseline coaches. Batting and bench coaches came into vogue during the 1960s and later. Because of the proliferation of uniformed coaches in the modern game, Major League Baseball now restricts the number of uniformed staff to six coaches and one manager during the course of a game.
Bench coach.
The position of bench coach is relatively new in baseball. On most teams, the bench coach is the closest thing a team has to a second-in-command. The bench coach serves as an in-game advisor to the manager, offering situational advice, and bouncing ideas back and forth in order to assist the manager in making game decisions. Should the manager be ejected, suspended, or unable to attend a game for medical or family reasons, the bench coach assumes the position of acting manager or if the manager is fired or resigns, then it is usually the bench who gets promoted to interim manager. The bench coach's responsibilities also include helping to set up the day's practice and stretching routines before a game, as well as coordinating spring training routines and practices.
Pitching and bullpen coaches.
A pitching coach mentors and trains teams' pitchers. He advises the manager on the condition of pitchers and their arms, and serves as an in-game coach for the pitcher currently on the mound. When a manager makes a visit to the mound, he typically is doing so to make a pitching change or to discuss situational defense. However, to talk about mechanics or how to pitch to a particular batter, the pitching coach is the one who will typically visit the mound. As the name suggests, the pitching coach is generally a former pitcher. One exception is Dave Duncan, the former pitching coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, who was a catcher. Prior to the early 1950s, pitching coaches were usually former catchers.
The bullpen coach is similar to a pitching coach, but works primarily with relief pitchers in the bullpen. He does not make mound visits, however, as he stays in the bullpen the entire game, working with relievers who are warming up to enter the game. Generally, the bullpen coach is either a former pitcher or catcher.
Offensive coaches: hitting coach and base coaches.
A hitting coach, as the name suggests, works with a team's players to improve their hitting techniques and form. He monitors players' swings during the game and over the course of the season, advising them when necessary between at-bats on adjustments to make. He also oversees their performance during practices, cage sessions, and pre-game batting practice. With the advent of technology, hitting coaches are increasingly utilizing video to analyze their hitters along with scouting the opposing pitchers. Video has allowed hitting coaches to clearly illustrate problem areas in the swing, making the adjustment period quicker for the player being analyzed. This process is typically called 'Video Analysis' in the industry.
Two on-field coaches are present when the team is at bat. Stationed in designated coaches' boxes near first and third base, they are appropriately named base coaches - individually, first base coach and third base coach. They assist in the direction of baserunners, help prevent pickoffs, and relay signals sent from the manager in the dugout to runners and batters. While the first base coach is primarily responsible for the batter as to whether he stops at first base or not or for a runner already on first, the third base coach carries more responsibility. His duties include holding or sending runners rounding second and third bases, as well as having to make critical, split-second decisions about whether to try to score a runner on a hit, and accounting for the arm strength of the opposing team's fielder and the speed and position of his baserunner.
Additional coaching responsibilities.
The bench coach, third base coach, and first base coach often are assigned additional responsibility for assisting players in specific areas, particularly defense. Common designations include outfield instructor, infield instructor, catching instructor and baserunning instructor. When a coaching staff is assembled, the selection of the first base coach is frequently made with the purpose of filling a gap in these coaching responsibilities, as the actual in-game duties of a first-base coach are relatively light.
Other coaches.
Teams may also employ individuals to work with players in other areas or activities. These positions sometimes include the word "coach" in their titles. Individuals holding these positions usually do not dress in uniform during games, as the number of uniformed coaches is restricted by Major League Baseball rules. The most prominent of these positions are the Athletic Trainer and the strength and conditioning coach. All Major League Baseball teams employ an Athletic Trainer, most employ a strength and conditioning coach. Other positions include bullpen catcher and batting practice pitcher. Some teams also employ additional coaches without specific responsibilities.
Minor and amateur leagues.
In general, Major League Baseball teams will have one person specifically assigned to each coaching position described above. However, minor league and amateur teams typically have coaches fulfill multiple responsibilities. A typical minor league/amateur team coaching structure will have a manager, a pitching coach, and a hitting coach, each of whom also assumes the responsibilities of the first and third base coaches, bullpen coach, etc. In U.S. college baseball, the title "manager" is not used; the person who fills the role of a professional manager is instead called the "head coach".

South Asia

 
South Asia or Southern Asia is the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as northern parts of India south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.
The current territories of Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan form the core countries of South Asia, while Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives are generally included, and Afghanistan and Myanmar often added. By various deviating definitions based on often substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory, Mauritius, Iran and the Tibet Autonomous Region are included as well. With the 7 core countries considered, South Asia is home to well over one fifth of the world's population, making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is an economic cooperation organisation in the region which was established in 1985.
Definitions.
The area of South Asia and its geographical extent is not clear cut as systemic and foreign policy orientations of its constituents are quite asymmetrical. Although there's a distinct core of countries, all formerly part of the British Empire, in defining the South Asia, there is much variation as to which (if any) other countries are included.
The current territories of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan (the core of the British Empire prior to 1947) form the core countries of South Asia, while the mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, and island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included. Afghanistan and Myanmar are often added, and by various definitions, the British Indian Ocean Territory, Mauritius, Iran and the Tibet Autonomous Region are included as well.
The common concept of South Asia is largely inherited from the administrative boundaries of the British Raj, with two major differences. The Aden Colony, British Somaliland and Singapore, though administered at various times under the Raj, have not been proposed as any part of South Asia. The 562 princely states that were protected by but not directly ruled by the Raj became administrative parts of South Asia upon joining Union of India or Dominion of Pakistan. Geopolitically, it had formed the whole territory of Greater India,
[[File:Location-Asia-UNsubregions.png|thumb|250px|right|United Nations geoscheme for Asia based on statistic convenience rather than implying any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories:
]]
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), a contiguous block of countries, started in 1985 with seven countries — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — but was extended to include Afghanistan as an eighth member in 2006. China, Iran and Myanmar have also applied for the status of full members of SAARC. This bloc of countries include three independent countries that were not part of the British Raj - Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan. The South Asia Free Trade Agreement and World Bank grouping of countries in the region includes only the original seven members of SAARC, and leaves Afghanistan out.
The United Nations scheme of sub-regions include all eight members of the SAARC as part of Southern Asia, along with Iran only for statistical purposes. Ajey Lele of Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses The United Nations finds it to be a "top option" for country grouping. Population Information Network (POPIN) includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as part of South Asia. Maldives, in view of its characteristics, was admitted as a member Pacific POPIN subregional network only in principle. The Hirschman–Herfindahl index of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific for the region includes only the original seven signatories of SAARC.
The British Indian Ocean Territory is connected to the region by a publication of Jane's for security considerations. The region may also include the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which was part of the British Indian princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, but is now administered as part of the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang.
Regional affinity of the bordering countries like Myanmar and Afghanistan is always confusing. Myanmar with its low-profile foreign policy has not drawn much scholarly attention, but Afghanistan is in a more complex situation. During the Iranian Revolution (1979) it was included into Southwest Asia, during the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979 to February 1989) it was included into Central Asia, and since the War on Terror (2001 onward) its included into South Asia. One school of thought divides the Asian continent latitudinally and treats South and Southeast Asia as one region. The South Asia Institute (SAI) of Heidelberg University and scholars like Howard Wringgings and James Guyot subscribe to this tendency.
A lack of coherent definition for South Asia has resulted in not only a lack of academic studies, but also in a lack interest for such studies. The confusion exists also because of a lack of clear boundary - geographically, geopolitical, socio-culturally, economically or historically - between South Asia and other parts of Asia, especially the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Identification with a South Asian identity was also found to be significantly low among respondents in a two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Indian Subcontinent.
The region was labelled variously as India (in its pre-modern sense), Greater India, Indian Subcontinent and South Asia. "Indian Subcontinent" is a term adopted and used by the British Empire. The terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia" are used interchangeably. According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, Indian Subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia "in more recent and neutral parlance." Indologist Ronald B. Inden argues that the usage of the term "South Asia" is getting more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia. Some academics hold that the term "South Asia" is in more common use in Europe and North America, rather than the terms "Subcontinent" or the "Indian Subcontinent".
According to anthropologist John R. Lukacs, "The Indian Subcontinent occupies the major landmass of South Asia." while according to political science professor Tatu Vanhanen, "The seven countries of South Asia constitute geographically a compact region around the Indian Subcontinent". According to Chris Brewster, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent; with Afghanistan, Iran and Maldives included it is more commonly referred to as South Asia, while according to a number of Indian scholars South Asia includes the Indian Subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal), as well as the island countries of Sri Lanka, Maldives and Mauritius. When the term Indian subcontinent is used to mean South Asia, the island countries of Sri Lanka and the Maldives may sometimes not be included, while Tibet and Nepal may either be included or excluded intermittently, depending on the context.
Boundary.
The boundaries of South Asia vary based on how the region is defined. South Asia's northern, eastern, and western boundaries vary based on definitions used, while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers.
Much of the region consists of a peninsula in south-central Asia, rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east, and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast.
One school of thought proposes the frontier between South and Southwest Asia (i.e. the Middle East lie in eastern Iran and western Afghanistan, while the frontier between South and Central Asia in northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Kyrgyzstan. Per the UN's definition the wider subregion's northern frontier is the Himalayas and southerly post-Soviet states of Central Asia (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan; its western boundary is the westerly border of Iran (with Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, and Iraq); and its eastern boundary is the easterly border of Myanmar (with Thailand and Laos).
Geography.
While South Asia had never been a coherent geopolitical region, it has a distinct geographical identity. The region is home to a variety of geographical features, such as glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodies — the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea — and has acutely varied climate zones. The tip of the Indian Peninsula had the highest quality pearls.
Indian plate.
Most of this region is a subcontinent resting on the Indian Plate (the northerly portion of the Indo-Australian Plate) separated from the rest of the Eurasian Plate. The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia, forming a land mass which extends from the Himalayas into a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and Eastern Indonesia, as well as Kunlun and Karakoram ranges, and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan, the Hindu Kush range and Balochistan. It may be noted that geophysically the Yarlung Tsangpo River river in Tibet is situated at the outside of the border of the Subcontinental structure, while the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan are situated inside that border.
It was once a small continent before colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50-55 million years ago and giving birth to the Himalayan range and the Tibetan plateau. It is the peninsular region south of the Himalayas and Kuen Lun mountain ranges and east of the Indus River and the Iranian Plateau, extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea (to the southwest) and the Bay of Bengal (to the southeast).
Climate.
The climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon period(s). The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalyan ranges.
As the Himalayas block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For most part, the climate of the region is called the Monsoon climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region.
South Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:
Maximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%-30%. Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by monsoons. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall. Two monsoon systems exist in the region:
The warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the Indus-Gangetic Plain and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June the jetstreams vanish above the Tibetan Plateau, low pressure over the Indus Valley deepens and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.
History.
Ancient era.
The history of core South Asia begins with evidence of human activity of "Homo sapiens," as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including "Homo erectus" from about 500,000 years ago. The Indus Valley Civilization, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of South Asia from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was the first major civilization in South Asia. A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE.
Classical era.
This Bronze Age civilisation collapsed before the end of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilisation, which extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the Mahajanapadas. In one of these kingdoms, Magadha, Mahavira and Gautama Buddha were born in the 6th or 5th century BCE and propagated their "Shramanic" philosophies.
Most of South Asia was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Various parts of India ruled by numerous Middle kingdoms for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. Southern India saw the rule of the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, and Pandyas. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or "Golden Age of India". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE.
Medieval era.
Muslim rule in core South Asia began in 8th century CE when the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern Punjab in modern day Pakistan, setting the stage for several successive invasions from Central Asia between the 10th and 15th centuries CE, leading to the formation of Muslim empires in South Asia such as the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Mughal rule came from Central Asia to cover most of the northern parts of South Asia. Mughal rulers introduced Central Asian art and architecture to India. In addition to the Mughals and various Rajput kingdoms, several independent Hindu states, such as the Vijayanagara Empire, the Maratha Empire, Eastern Ganga Empire and the Ahom Kingdom, flourished contemporaneously in southern, western, eastern and northeastern India respectively.
Modern era.
The Mughal Empire suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, leaving a power vacuum that was exploited by local rulers such as the Sikhs and Marathas and later used by the British East India Company to gain ascendancy over most of South Asia.
Beginning in the mid-18th century and over the next century, large areas of India were annexed by the British East India Company. Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed a period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic decline. During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress and later joined by the Muslim League. India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.
Territory and region data.
2009 referenced population figures except where noted.
Core countries.
With the core seven countries, the area covers about 4.48 million km² (1.7 million mi²), which is 10% of the Asian continent or 2.4% of the world's land surface area. They account for about 34% of Asia's population (or over 16.5% of the world's population) and are home to a vast array of peoples.
Demographics.
Total population of South Asia is about 1.70 billion.
Ethnic groups.
South Asia, which consists of the nations of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, is ethnically diverse, with more than 2,000 ethnic entities with populations ranging from hundreds of millions to small tribal groups. South Asia has been invaded and settled by many ethnic groups over the centuries - including various Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, Austroasiatic and Iranian groups - and amalgamation of Dravidian, Indo-Aryan and native societies has produced composite cultures with many common traditions and beliefs. But, the traditions of different ethnic groups in South Asia have diverged throughout earlier times, sometimes giving rise to strong local traditions such as the distinct South Indian culture.
Other ethnic groups, successively streaming in later mainly from Central Asia e.g. Sakas, Kushans, Huns etc. influenced pre-existing South Asian cultures. Among the last of these new arrivals were the Arabs followed by the Turks, the Pashtuns and the Moghuls. However, Arab influence remained relatively limited in comparison to that of the Turks, Pashtuns and Moghuls, who brought in much cultural influence and contributed to the birth of Urdu, a syncretic language of combined Indo-Persian heritage, which is widely spoken today. Ethnic Englishmen and other Britons are now practically absent after their two centuries long colonial presence, although they have left an imprint of western culture in the elite society.
Languages.
The largest spoken language in this region is Hindi, its speakers numbering almost 422 million, the second largest spoken language is Bengali, with about 210 million speakers. Urdu is also a major language spoken in the subcontinent, especially in Pakistan, and is similar linguistically to Hindi; Hindi and Urdu together make up Hindustānī. Other languages of this region fall into a few major linguistic groups: the Dravidian languages:Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and the Indo-Aryan languages, a sub-branch of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages.
The other great sub-branch of Indo-Iranian, the Iranian languages, also have significant minority representation in South Asia, with Pashto and Balochi being widely spoken along the northwestern fringes of the region, in modern-day Pakistan. Many Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups, who are speakers of their language-group, are found in northeast India, Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. Dzongkha a member of this linguistic group, is the national language of Bhutan. There are as many as 24 Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in Bhutan. Other small groups, speaking Austroasiatic languages, are also present in South Asia. English is another language which dominates South Asia, especially as a medium of advanced education and government administration.
Most of South Asia writes using various abugidas of Brāhmī origin while languages such as Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi use derivatives of the Perso-Arabic script. Not all languages in South Asia follow this strict dichotomy though. For example, Kashmiri is written in both the Perso-Arabic script and in the Devanagari script. The same can be said for Punjabi, which is written in both Shahmukhi and Gurmukhī. Dhivehi is written in a script called Tāna that shows characteristics of both the Arabic alphabet and of an abugida.
Religions.
Indian religions are the religions that originated in South Asia; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Although Indian religions are connected through the history of South Asia, they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.
Arabs traders brought the Abrahamic religion of Islam to South Asia, first in the present day Kerala, Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands.
Later Sindh, Balochistan, and parts of the Punjab region saw conquest by the Arab caliphates along with an influx of Muslims from further west, which resulted in spread of Islam in parts of Western region of South Asia. Subsequently, Muslim Mughal conquerors and further emigration and immigration furthered it throughout the Indo-Gangetic plains, further east towards Bengal, and deep south up to the Deccan.
Economy.
South Asia is the poorest region in the world after Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index, just over a quarter of the world's MPI poor people live in Africa, while a half live in South Asia. The study also found there are more poor people in eight Indian states than in the 26 poorest African countries. According to the index, 55 per cent of people in South Asia are MPI-poor and in sub-Saharan Africa, 64.5 per cent of people are MPI-poor. And according to the poverty data of World Bank, more than 40% of the population in the region lived on less than the International Poverty Line of $1.25 per day in 2005, compared to 50% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa.
But in 2014, Acco to World bank ICP 2011 report based on PPP, South Asia’s share of the world’s absolute poor was estimated at about 49 percent in 2005 but in 2011 it had declined to 29 percent due to record poverty decline in IndiaIn 2014,Economists at both the Washington-based Center for Global Development and the Brookings Institution found that In India the number of people living on less than International poverty line of $1.25 a day fell from 393m of the country’s 1.2bn people to just over 100mbased on World Bank's 2011 ICP report,Even setting a poverty line equivalent to $1.78 in 2011 PPP dollars ($1.55 in 2005 PPP dollars), the Brookings researchers found that the number of people living in below poverty line had fallen to 148 million.
Sri Lanka has the highest GDP per capita in the region, while Afghanistan has the lowest. India is the largest economy in the region (US$ 1.97 trillion) and makes up almost 82% of the South Asian economy; it is the world's 10th largest in nominal terms and 3rd largest by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates. Pakistan has the next largest economy and the 5th highest GDP per capita in the region, followed by Bangladesh and then by Sri Lanka which has the 2nd highest per capita and is the 4th largest economy in the region. According to a World Bank report in 2007, South Asia is the least integrated region in the world; trade between South Asian states is only 2% of the region's combined GDP, compared to 20% in East Asia. The Economist has blamed this on Indian neglect of its neighbors.
Governance.
India and Pakistan are the dominant political powers in the region. India is by far the largest country in the area covering around three-fourths the land area of the subcontinent. India has the largest population of around three times the combined population of the 6 other countries in the subcontinent. India is also the World's largest democracy India's annual defence budget for 2013-14 is $39.2 Billion which is equal to the whole Pakistan's Federal budget of $39.3 billion for 2014-15.
Bangladesh is a unitary state and parliamentary democracy. Bangladesh also stands out as one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world,” said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh’s legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-
financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.
Diplomacy among the countries of South Asia has been mainly driven by populist politics, with the centre-stage taken by India-Pakistan conflict ever since their independence in 1947, and then the creation of Bangladesh under tense circumstances in 1971. During the height of Cold war, the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the US, while India played crucial role in forming the Non-Aligned Movement and while maintaining goodwill relations with the USSR.
Pakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan has become a concern for the South Asian region. In Nepal, the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism, and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE, which was suppressed recently. Burma's politics is dominated by a military Junta, which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.
Health and nutrition.
There are 421 million MPI-poor people in eight Indian states alone - Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - while there are 410 million in the 26 poorest African countries combined. Roughly 42% of Indian children under age 5 suffer from malnutrition.
According to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian population and about 75% of South Asia's poor live in rural areas and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood. According to the Global Hunger Index, South Asia has one of the highest child malnutrition rates in the world. In a latest report published by UNICEF in 2008 on global hunger shows that the actual number of child deaths was around 2.1 million. As of 2008 India is ranked 66th on the global hunger index.
The 2006 report stated that "the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region". Corruption and the lack of initiative on the part of the government has been one of the major problems associated with nutrition in India. Illiteracy in villages has been found to be one of the major issues that need more government attention. The report mentioned that, although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the Green Revolution in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has "inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children".

MGR-3 Little John

The MGR-3 Little John was a free flight artillery rocket system designed and put into service by the U.S. Army during the 1950s and 1960s. 
Description.
It was a fin-stabilized field artillery rocket that followed a ballistic trajectory to ground targets. The rocket XM51 consisted of a warhead, a rocket motor assembly, and an igniter assembly. The components were shipped in separate containers and assembled by the user. 
The Little John differs from the Honest John in not only its size but how it is stabilized in flight. The flight of the Honest John is stabilized by a spin that is imparted to the rocket by spin rockets after the round leaves the launcher. The Littlejohn rocket flight is stabilized by applying spin to the rocket while on the launcher, just before firing. This manual method of stabilization was called "spin-on-straight-rail" (SOSR). The system was maufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. 
The missile and launcher system were light enough to be easily transported by helicopters and other aircraft or towed by a vehicle. The Phase II Littlejohn weapon system was initially deployed with the 1st Missile Battalion, 157th Field Artillery in Okinawa, Japan.
The missile was retired beginning in July, 1967, with the final missile removed from inventory in 1970. Five hundred missiles were produced during the life of the weapon program.

Comanchero Motorcycle Club

The Comanchero Motorcycle Club is an outlaw motorcycle gang in Australia, with chapters in Strathfield. The word "outlaw" itself carries a specific meaning which does not imply immediate criminal intent; rather it means the club is not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and does not adhere to the AMA's rules. The Comancheros are participants in the United Motorcycle Council of NSW, which has recently convened a conference aimed at addressing legislation aimed against the "bikie" clubs, their poor public image in the wake of several violent clashes and ongoing biker wars, and defusing deadly feuds such as the Comancheros' battles with the Hells Angels. The sincerity of these efforts to defend the battered image of the clubs has met with skepticism.
History.
The original club was formed by William George "Jock" Ross, a Scottish immigrant, in Sydney, New South Wales in 1968. He chose the name after seeing the John Wayne film "The Comancheros". In late 1982, a second Comanchero chapter was formed by Anthony Mark "Snoddy" Spencer, who had broken away from the first chapter after challenging Ross' authority. When visiting the United States with Charles Paul "Charlie" Scibberas, another member of the second chapter, Spencer met with members of the Texan motorcycle club, the Bandidos and the two gangs became allies. The Bandidos eventually patched-over the second Comanchero chapter to become the Bandidos' first Australian chapter.
The Comanchero and Bandidos were now rivals and in 1984, the two clubs were involved in the Milperra massacre, a shoot-out which left seven people dead, including four Comanchero, two Bandidos, and a 14-year-old bystander. Jock Ross received a lifetime jail sentence for his involvement in the Milperra massacre but only served five years and three months before he was released.
The Comanchero and Hells Angels were also believed to be involved in a clash at Sydney Airport on Sunday, 22 March 2009. The clash resulted in one man being beaten to death and police estimated as many as 15 men were involved in the violence. Police documents detail the brawl as a result of a Comanchero Club member and a Hells Angels Member being on the same flight from Melbourne. Six Comancheros were arrested as a result of the altercation and have been convicted of "riot and affray", while Comanchero president Mick Hawi was also found guilty of murder on 2 November 2011. As a result of heightening violence, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees announced the state police anti-gang squad would be boosted to 125 members from 50.
It was announced in late 2009 that a new national president was elected named Duax Ngakuru.
Perth chapter.
The Comanchero established a single Western Australian chapter in 2010 which is presently located on Wellman Street, Northbridge at the Fitness and Fight Centre.
The Comanchero expansion into Western Australia was delayed by the 2010 arrest of Steve Milenkovski who was about to be patched as the Perth’s Chapter president when he was arrested in the culmination of Operation Baystone. Operation Baystone resulted in Milenkovski, Yavuz Ozan, Hao Bi, and Mark Vick Kitos being charged with various drug offences. The operation seized 7.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine imported into Western Australia from New South Wales.
In August 2012 Milenkovski was found guilty of two counts of Possess a Prohibited Drug with Intent to Sell or Supply after a 9 week Perth District Court trial and sentenced to 17 years jail as the "king pin". Two of his co-accused, were convicted of one charge each of attempted possession including David Tanevski who was sentenced to eight years' jail. Hao Bi, who was alleged to have been the courier was acquitted.
In May 2014 eight men including two patched members of the Comanchero were charged for allegedly extorting businesses in Northbridge.
Infighting.
On 5 September 2012, Comanchero member Faalau Pisu was murdered, being shot in the head outside the Serbian National Defence Council at Canley Vale whilst attending a wedding. A 25-year-old gang member and a 27-year-old associate of the club were also shot and injured. NSW Police allege that an internal rift within the Comanchero was behind recent shootings involving Comanchero members.

History of Gaza

The known history of Gaza spans 4,000 years. Gaza was ruled, destroyed and repopulated by various dynasties, empires, and peoples. Originally a Canaanite settlement, it came under the control of the ancient Egyptians for roughly 350 years before being conquered by the Philistines, who made it one of the principal cities of their pentapolis in the 12th-century BCE. Gaza fell to the Israelite King David in about 1000 BCE, and with the division of Israelite kingdoms came under the dominance of northern Samaria. With the fall of the Kingdom of Israel in about 730 BCE, it became part of the Assyrian empire, and subsequently, that of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Alexander the Great besieged the city for five months before finally capturing it in 332 BCE. Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for Hellenistic learning and philosophy, was resettled by nearby Bedouins. The area changed hands regularly between two Greek successor-kingdoms, the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt. The city was besieged and taken by the Hasmoneans in 96 BCE.
After the Roman Empire began its influence in the area in 63 BCE, Gaza was rebuilt under the command of Pompey Magnus, and granted to Herod the Great thirty years later. Throughout the Roman period, Gaza maintained its prosperity, receiving grants from several different emperors. A 500-member senate governed the city, and a diverse array of Greeks, Romans, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Nabateans populated the city. On the breakup of the Roman Empire, Gaza became part of the Eastern Byzantine Empire. Conversion to Christianity in the city was spearheaded and completed under Saint Porphyrius, who destroyed its eight pagan temples between 396 and 420 CE.
Gaza was the first city in Palestine to be conquered by the Arab Rashidun Caliphate in 635 CE. The arrival of the Muslim rulers brought drastic changes, as its churches were transformed into mosques, the population adopted Islam as their religion, and Arabic became the official language. Under the Arab Muslims, the city went through periods of prosperity and decline. The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100, and ruled until 1187, when the city was conquered by Saladin and the Ayyubids. Gaza was in Mamluk hands by the late 13th-century, and became the capital of an administrative unit of Bilad ash-Sham, that stretched from the Sinai Peninsula to Caesarea. By the time of its incorporation into the Ottoman Empire in the 16th-century, it was but a small village. The Ottomans charged the Ridwan family with governance over the city in the early 16th-century. From the early 19th-century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt, with significant numbers of Egyptian Muslims moving in and Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it in 1831. His brief rule ended in 1840, after the Ottomans defeated his forces outside the city. The 20th-century began in Gaza with two destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914.
In 1917, the forces of the Triple Entente captured the city after a third battle against the Ottoman forces there. The city also expanded in the first half of the 20th-century under the Mandatory Palestine. According to the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to the Arab Palestinian state. The population of the city and the Gaza Strip swelled as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the war the All-Palestine Government was declared in Gaza by the Arab League, and a Palestinian executive body was assembled in the city. After the war, it functioned as a client government of Egypt until incorporated into the United Arab Republic in 1959, de facto being absorbed into Egypt, though its residents were not granted citizenship. Egypt held Gaza until the 1967 Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. Gaza became a center of political resistance in the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas emerged as the victor in Palestinian factional fighting with Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority there. Israel has blockaded the Strip ever since and launched an assault in 2008–2009, which it characterized as a response to Qassam rocket attacks. The bombardment and ground assault reportedly left over 1,300 people dead in the territory, and destroyed over 4,000 buildings.
Bronze Age.
Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to 3300–3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an Ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to the cedar trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the Early Bronze Age II.
Gaza enjoyed demographic and economic growth again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization and all of the cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd-century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the Early Bronze Age IV. An urban center known as Tell al-Ajjul began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite Hyksos, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose for the third time in the 15th-century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th-century, at the end of the Bronze Age.
Ancient period.
A city which would become present-day Gaza began to develop on the site of Tell al-Ajjul. This city served as Egypt’s administrative capital in Canaan, and was the residence of the Egyptian governor of the region. A caravan point of strategic importance from the earliest times, it was constantly involved in the wars between Egypt and Syria and the Mesopotamian powers, and appeared frequently in Egyptian and Assyrian records. Under Tuthmosis III, it is mentioned on the Syrian-Egyptian caravan route and in the Amarna letters as "Azzati". Gaza was in Egyptian hands for 350 years, until it was conquered by the Philistines, a seafaring people with cultural links to the Aegean, in the 12th-century BCE. It then became a part of the pentapolis; a league of the Philistines' five most important city-states. The Hebrew Bible mentions the Avvites occupying an area that extended as far as Gaza, and that these people were dispossessed by the Caphtorites from the island of Caphtor (modern Crete). Some scholars speculate that the Philistines were descendants of the Caphtorites.
In the Hebrew Bible, Gaza is also mentioned as the place where Samson was imprisoned and met his death. The prophets Amos and Zephaniah prophesied that Gaza would be deserted. According to biblical accounts, Gaza came under Israelite rule from the reign of King David in the early 11th-century BCE. When the United Monarchy split in about 930 BCE, Gaza became a part of the northern Kingdom of Israel. When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II around 730 BCE, Gaza came under Assyrian rule. In the 7th-century, it again came under Egyptian control, but during the Persian period (6th-4th centuries BCE) it enjoyed a certain independence and flourished. In 529 BCE, Cambyses I unsuccessfully attacked Gaza and later, around 520 BCE, the Greeks established a trading post in Gaza. The first coins were minted on the Athens model around 380 BCE.
Alexander the Great besieged Gaza—the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt—for five months, finally capturing it 332 BCE. Led by a eunuch named Batis and defended by Arab mercenaries, Gaza withstood the siege for two months, until it was overcome by storm. The defenders, mostly local elements, fought to the death and the women and children were taken as captives. The city was resettled by neighboring Bedouins, who were sympathetic to Alexander's rule. He then organized the city into a "polis" or "city-state" and Greek culture took root in Gaza which gained a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenic learning and philosophy. Belonging at first to the Ptolemaic kingdom, it passed after 200 BCE to the Seleucids.
In the 1st-century BCE and the first half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had hoped for help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city destroyed by Jannaeus when Aretas did not come to their aid.
Classical antiquity.
Roman rule.
Gaza was rebuilt by consul Aulus Gabinius after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BCE, under the command of Pompey Magnus. Roman rule brought six centuries of relative peace and prosperity to the city—which became a busy port and locus of trade between the Middle East and Africa. In the New Testament, it is mentioned as being on the caravan route to Egypt It was granted to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a separate unit within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, the governor of Idumea, was in charge of the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria. After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province of Syria. In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.
Throughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Philistines, Greeks, Romans, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint stamped out coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 CE, Emperor Hadrian, who favored Gaza, personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium, which soon became known from Alexandria to Damascus. The city was adorned with many pagan temples—the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local deity Tyche.
The spread of Christianity in Gaza was initiated by Philip the Arab around 250 CE; first in the port of Maiuma, but later into the city. The religion faced obstacles as it spread through the inland population because pagan worship was strong. In 299, an unverified number of local Christians who assembled in Gaza to hear the Scriptures read were seized and mutilated by the Romans. Also, its Christians were harshly repressed during the Diocletianic Persecution in 303. The first bishop of Gaza was Philemon, believed to have been one of the 72 disciples, but the first cleric was Saint Silvanus who, during the persecution by Maximinianus in 310, was arrested along with about 30 other Christians, and condemned to death.
Byzantine rule and advent of Christianity.
On the breakup of the Roman Empire, Gaza became part of the Byzantine Empire as part of the Palaestina Prima province. The official recognition of Christianity by Constantine I did not increase sympathy of the religion in Gaza. Although Gaza was represented by Bishop Asclepas in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the vast majority of its inhabitants continued to worship the native gods. As the Roman Empire was crumbling at this time, Gaza remained unaffected. At this time, the inhabitants of Maiuma converted to Christianity "en masse". Constantine II decided to separate it from pagan Gaza in 331, giving Maiuma its own episcopal see. Julian reversed the process during his reign in the latter half of the 4th-century. Although Maiuma had its own bishop, clergy, and diocesan territory, it shared its magistrates and administration with Gaza. Upon Julian's death, Maiuma's independence was restored and the rivalry between it and Gaza intensified.
During most of the 4th-century, the Christian community was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members were not allowed to hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.
Depicted in the mosaic Map of Madaba of 600, Gaza was the most important political and commercial center on the southern coast of Palestine. Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach Raphia. The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City.
Arab Caliphate.
Rashidun rule.
There were already converts to Islam among the city's Greek-speaking Christian population before Gaza's capitulation to the Muslims. At the near end of the Byzantine era, Gaza had become the home of an increasingly influential group of Arab traders from Mecca, including Umar ibn al-Khattab, who later became the second ruler of the Islamic Caliphate. Muhammad visited the city more than once before being a prophet of Islam.
In 634, Gaza was besieged by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As, with assistance from Khalid ibn al-Walid, following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. During the three-year siege, the city's Jewish community fought alongside the Byzantine garrison. The victory of al-'As is attributed to a combination of Arab strategy, Byzantine weakness, and the influence of Gaza’s Arab residents. Gaza was the first city of Palestine to be conquered by the Muslims and the only one to be captured during the reign of the caliph Abu Bakr. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf—who also lived as a merchant in Gaza—was buried, the city was not destroyed by the victorious Arab army.
The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought drastic changes to Gaza; its churches were transformed into mosques, including the Cathedral of John the Baptist (previously the Temple of Marnas) which became the Great Mosque of Gaza. The population adopted Islam as their religion, and eventually, Arabic became the official language. The Christian population was reduced to an insignificant minority and the Samaritan residents deposited their property with their high priest and fled the city east upon the Muslim conquest. Gaza was placed under the administration of Jund Filastin ("District of Palestine") of Bilad al-Sham province during Rashidun rule, and continued to be a part of the district under the successive caliphates of the Umayyads and Abbasids.
Arab dynasties.
Under the Umayyads Gaza served as a minor administrative center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, as noted in the writings of the bishop Saint Willibald, who visited the city in 723. The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine and the arrival of the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law. In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent "fiqhs" (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.
In 796 the city was laid waste during a civil war by the Arab tribes of the area. Gaza apparently recovered by the 9th-century according to Persian geographer Istakhri who wrote that merchants grew rich there "for this place was a great market for the people of the Hejaz." A Christian writer, writing in 867, described it as "rich in all things". Gaza's port, however, occasionally succumbed to neglect under Arab rule and an overall decline in commerce followed because of infighting among Palestine's rulers and Bedouin bandits who disrupted overland trade routes towards the city.
From 868 to 905 the Tulunids ruled Gaza, and around 909, the influence of the Fatimids from Egypt started to grow, leading to a slow decline of the city. The orange was introduced to the area, arriving from India in 943. In 977, the Fatimids established an agreement with the Seljuk Turks, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt. By the 985 CE, while under Fatimid rule, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi described Gaza as "a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert. There is here a beautiful mosque, also to be seen is the monument for the Khalif Umar." The Arabic language poet, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Ghazzi was born in the city in 1049.
Crusader and Ayyubid rule.
The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100. According to the chronicler William of Tyre, the Crusaders found it uninhabited and in ruins. Unable to totally refortify the hilltop on which Gaza was built, due to a lack of resources, King Baldwin III built a small castle there in 1149. The possession of Gaza completed the military encirclement of the Fatimid-held city of Ascalon to the north. After the castle's construction, Baldwin granted it and the surrounding region to the Knights Templar. He also had the Great Mosque converted into the Cathedral of Saint John.
In 1154, the Arab traveler al-Idrisi wrote Gaza "is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders." William of Tyre confirms that in 1170, a civilian population was persuaded to occupy the area outside the castle and establish feeble fortifications and gates surrounding the community. That same year, King Amalric I of Jerusalem withdrew Gaza's Templars to assist him against an Egypt-based Ayyubid force led by Saladin at nearby Darum. However, Saladin evaded the Crusader force and assaulted Gaza instead, destroying the town built outside the castle's walls and killing its inhabitants after they were refused refuge in the castle, managed by Miles of Plancy at the time. Seven years later, the Templars prepared for another defense of Gaza against Saladin, but this time his forces fell on Ascalon. In 1187, following Ascalon's capitulation, the Templars surrendered Gaza in return for the release of their master Gerard of Ridefort. Saladin then ordered the destruction of the city's fortifications in 1191. A year later, after recapturing it, Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city, but the walls were dismantled as a result of the Treaty of Ramla agreed upon months later in 1193.
According to geographer Abu al-Fida, Gaza was a medium-sized city, possessing gardens and a seashore in the early 13th-century. The Ayyubids constructed the Shuja'iyya neighborhood—the first extension of Gaza beyond the Old City.
Mamluk rule.
The Ayyubid period of rule virtually ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza—his southernmost point of conquest. Hulagu left his army in Gaza after being recalled due to the death of the Mongol emperor, and the Mamluk general Baibars subsequently drove the Mongols out of the city and again defeated them at Baysan in the Galilee. He was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt on his way back from the battlefield after the assassination of Sultan Qutuz. Baibars passed through Gaza six times during his expeditions against the remnants of the Crusader states and the Mongols from 1263 to 1269. The domination of the Mamluks started in 1277, with Gaza being a mere village in the territory of Ramla. In 1279 Sultan Qalawun encamped in Gaza for fifty days while on a march against the Mongols.
In 1293 his son al-Nasir Muhammad instituted Gaza as the capital of the province that bore its name, "Mamlakat Ghazzah" ("the Governorship of Gaza"). This province covered the coastal plain from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, extending in the east to the western slopes of Samaria and the Hebron Hills; its major towns were Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. In 1294, an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks. That same year Gaza was the center of a conspiracy against the Sultan of Egypt, which was detected and crushed before being carried out.
The Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described the city in 1300 as "so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land." He accounted to Gaza the cities and towns of Ascalon, Jaffa, Caesarea, Arsuf, Deir al-Balah, al-Arish (in the northern center of the Sinai Peninsula), Bayt Jibrin, Karatiyya, Hebron and Jerusalem—all of which had their own governors. The Bahri "emir" Baybars al-Ala'i ruled between 1307-1310, during the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad before the latter was briefly ousted by Baibars II. Gaza was one of the places returned to the allegiance of the exiled sultan; in 1310, al-Nasir Muhammad defeated the Sultan Baibars II at Gaza, forcing the latter to surrender his throne to him. Baibars II was imprisoned in the city.
Sanjar al-Jawli acquired the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed it into a flourishing city, having built for it a horse-race course, a "madrasa" ("college"), a mosque, a "khan" ("caravansary"), a "maristan" ("hospital"), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the "Na'ib al-Saltana" ("Viceroy") of Syria, Tankiz al-Husami.
In 1348 the Bubonic Plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants, and in 1352, Gaza suffered a destructive flood—which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, by 1355, the Berber traveler Ibn Batutta visited the city and noted that it was "large and populous, and has many mosques. But there were no walls round it. There was here of old a fine Jami' Mosque (the Great Mosque), but the one presentused was built by Amir Jawli [Sanjar al-Jawli."
In the early 1380s, the governor of Gaza, Akboga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against Sultan Barquq. He was detected and exiled to Karak, and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, the city fell into the hands of Ilboga Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. Gaza was retaken without violence, as Ibn Bakish met Nasiri at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The unseated Barquq regained his throne in 1388, and retook Gaza the next year. In 1401 a swarm of locusts destroyed Gaza's crops. A battle between the rival Mamluk rulers Akberdy and Kansowah Khamsieh occurred in Gaza; Khamsieh had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful final stand. Between 1428 to 1433, Gaza was ruled by Sayf ad-Din Inal, who would later become sultan in 1453. During his sultanate, in 1455, Inal's "dawadar" ("executive secretary") had the Madrasa of Birdibak built in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood.
Ottoman era.
Early Ottoman rule and the Ridwan dynasty.
In 1516, Gaza—by now a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. 
Shortly after Palestine's quick submission to the Ottomans, it was divided into six districts, including the Sanjak of Gaza (District of Gaza) which stretched from Jaffa in the north to Bayt Jibrin in the east and Rafah in the south. The "sanjak" was a part of the larger Wilayat Dimashq or the "Province of Syria".
The first governor of Sanjak Gaza was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died a short while later and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming governor of Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.
Although no explanation is provided in the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their castle. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the "sanjaks" of Nablus and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Wilayat Dimashq in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control and knowledge of the Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.
'Arab Hasan's son Husayn Pasha was governor of Nablus and Jerusalem, and inherited the impoverished governorship of Gaza when his father died. He borrowed a large sum from the French in order to meet the heavy taxes imposed on the city by Hassan Aga, governor the Wilayat Sidon—the province that Gaza belonged to. Husayn's period in office was peaceful and prosperous for the city, and he gained a good reputation for he considerably reduced the strife between the nearby Bedouins and the settled population. He appointed his son Ibrahim to be governor of the Gaza and Jerusalem districts, but when the latter was killed during an expedition against the Druze in Mount Lebanon in 1660, Husayn resumed control of Gaza. That year, Gaza was designated the capital of Palestine, indicating the city's rapid recovery. The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. Anonymous petitions sent to Istanbul complaining about Husayn's failure to protect the "Hajj" caravan and alleged pro-Christian tendencies, however, served as an excuse for the Ottoman government to depose him. He was soon imprisoned in Damascus and his assets confiscated by provincial authorities. He was later sent to Istanbul and died in prison there in 1663.
Husayn's brother Musa Pasha then governed Gaza into the early 1670s, implementing an anti-French and anti-Christian regime to appease the Ottoman government. Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office.
In 1723, the Ottomans appointed Salih Pasha Tuqan of the Nablus-based Touqan family to govern Gaza and two other "sanjaks" until his death in 1742. In the 1750s, a local Bedouin tribes disposed of the plunder from a Meccan caravan, consisting of 13,000 camel-loads of goods, into Gaza's markets, boosting the city's wealth. The attack on the caravan was a reprisal to the Ottomans who had recently replaced the governor of Damascus. In 1763, Gaza staged a revolt against the Turks. Then, in November 1770, Ali Bey al-Kabir, the rebellious Mamluk sultan of Egypt, sent troops to Gaza to aid Dhaher al-Omar in the Galilee, helping him check the power of the Ottomans in the Levant. Gaza was briefly occupied by the French Army under Napoleon Bonaparte, who referred to it as "the outpost of Africa, the door to Asia", in 1799. Most of its inhabitants fled as a result. His forces easily razed the remains of the city walls (which had not been rebuilt since their destruction by Saladin), but abandoned the city after their failed siege of Acre that same year. The duration of French influence in Gaza was too short to have a palpable effect.
Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival.
Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt from the early 19th-century; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832. Strangely, in 1833, Muhammad Ali instructed his son Ibrahim Pasha not to purchase Gaza's cotton harvest (cotton production was Ali's main source of wealth and Egypt's production was low that year), instead allowing its residents to dispose of it how they wished.
American scholar Edward Robinson visited Gaza in 1838, describing it as a "thickly populated" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. He further stated that its soil was rich and supported groves of "delicious and abundant" apricots and mulberries. Although Gaza's port was by then inactive, it benefited from trade and commerce because of its position on the caravan route between Egypt and Syria, as well as from the production of soap and cotton for trade with the Bedouin. The governor of Gaza at the time was Sheikh Sa'id. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation.
The Bubonic Plague struck again in 1839 and the city stagnated, as it lacked political and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began to recover from the plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.
Although the first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities. Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically dominated by a number of powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families. Two destructive earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914.
When World War I erupted in 1917, British forces were defeated by the Ottomans in the first and second Battle of Gaza. General Edmund Allenby, leading the Allied Forces, finally conquered Gaza in a third battle.
British rule.
After the war, the League of Nations granted quasi-colonial authority over former Ottoman territories to Great Britain and France; Gaza was included in the British Mandate of Palestine.
The Jewish Quarter of Gaza was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots and most of Gaza's fifty Jewish families fled the city. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion, with new neighborhoods, such as Rimal and Zeitoun being built along the coast, and the southern and eastern plains. Areas damaged in the riots also went through reconstruction. Most of the funding for these developments came from international organizations and missionary groups.
Egyptian occupation.
As a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt obtained control of Gaza and the surrounding area. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel.
From 1948 through 1959, Gaza was nominally under the jurisdiction of the All-Palestine Government, an entity established by the Arab League during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, purportedly to provide a Palestinian government for Palestine. However, the members of the Government were removed to Cairo, and had little or no influence over events in Gaza. Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip was interrupted for four months during the 1956 Suez Crisis.
Upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing and the establishment of local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics.
In 1959 with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially become a part of the United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon the withdrawal of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.
Israeli occupation.
Gaza was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War after the defeat of a coalition of Arab armies. Under Israeli occupation, existing structures of administration in Gaza would be maintained and administrative tasks would continue to be executed by Palestinian civil servants. Although this policy of "government but not administration" was declared, the Israeli military frequently interfered in the city's administration in order to control local resistance. In the immediate aftermath of the 1967 War, the military governor of Gaza threatened to dismiss the municipal council and cut off utility services if the local leadership was unable to force the residents of the city to turn in their weapons. This action was deemed excessive and was revoked by the Israeli military governor of the Gaza Strip, however. Organized armed struggle against Israel peaked between 1969 and 1971, but was largely crushed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) under the command of Ariel Sharon.
In 1971, the occupational Israeli Army attempted to disperse the high concentration of Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes that resulted in the establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.
Palestinian control.
Palestinian Authority.
In September 1993, leaders of Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.
In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its military and settlements from the Gaza Strip including the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip adjacent to the border with Egypt, as part of its unilateral disengagement plan. Since the Palestinian organization Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006, it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization Fatah.
Hamas administration.
In 2007 Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas has "de facto" control of the city and Strip. Israel bombarded Gaza and nearby cities in the Gaza Strip in an air and ground assault codenamed "Operation Summer Rains" with the aim to end continued Qassam rocket attacks launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and to secure the release of an Israeli soldier captured by Palestinian militants.
A human rights coalition charged March 6, 2008 that the humanitarian situation in Gaza had reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War. On December 27–28, 2008 Israel commenced air strikes against Gaza, codenamed "Operation Cast Lead". Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military excursions and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. By January 3, 2009, Israeli tanks and infantry were invading Gaza with air and naval support. Thirteen Israelis, including ten soldiers were killed, while, according to Palestinian sources, a total of more than 1,300 Palestinians were killed and 5,500 injured. In addition 4,000 buildings were destroyed and 20,000 damaged throughout the Gaza Strip.

Billy Douglas (rugby union)

William 'Billy' Douglas (2 July 1863 - 24 September 1943) was a Welsh rugby union back who played club rugby for Cardiff and international rugby for Wales. Douglas was also a rugby referee, and officiated over four international matches.
Rugby career.
Douglas played club rugby for Cardiff, and in the 1885–86 season he succeeded Frank Hancock as the senior club captain. Douglas was first selected to play for the Welsh national team as part of the 1886 Home Nations Championship in the opening game against England. The team was captained by Newport's Charlie Newman and Douglas was one of three Cardiff players gaining their first cap in the game. Although Wales lost the game, the margin was low and Douglas was re-selected for the very next Welsh international, this time to Scotland. Wales lost this game, but due to a dispute with Ireland failed to complete all the matches in the tournament. In the next year's tournament Douglas was selected for the first two games. The first was a drawn game against England at Llanelli, the country's best result to date against the English. His fourth and final game was the team's second game of the 1887 Championship, away to Scotland, which Wales again lost.
Four years after the end of his international playing career, Douglas began his international refereeing career. Douglas was chosen to referee the 1891 Home Nations Championship match between Ireland and England at Lansdowne Road. His second match as referee was in 1894, in a match between England and Ireland played this time at the Rectory Field. His final two international games as a referee were both between England and Scotland, in 1896 and 1903. The 1903 match was of particular note, as it saw the only appearance of Scotland's John Dallas, who also scored a try in the game. Dallas would himself go on to referee at international level, in the infamous 1905 game between Wales and New Zealand.

Crookes Valley Park

Crookes Valley Park is an area of public parkland in the Crookesmoor area of the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. The park lies just under two kilometres west of the City centre at . It is one of the three “Crookesmoor Parks” the other two being Weston Park and The Ponderosa.
History.
Crookes Valley Park covers an area of approximately 4.8 hectares (11.9 acres), the majority of the park is taken up by the lake which was originally a water supply reservoir called the Old Great Dam. It was one of ten reservoirs built in open countryside in the valley between Crookes and Upperthorpe to supply water to the growing City of Sheffield in the 18th century. The Old Great Dam was built in 1785 with a capacity of and was thought big enough to supply the town for many years, however the ten reservoirs became obsolete by the 20th century and were all filled in with the exception of the Old Great Dam.
The Old Great Dam was integrated into Crookes Valley Park when it was set out by Sheffield Corporation in the early years of the 20th century. For many years it was used as a boating lake and is still used for fishing, it is fed by a small stream which flows through a culvert into the western corner. The lake is said to be deep and there are unsubstantiated stories of large Pike and Zander living in the depths. On the south western fringe of the park is the Dam House bar and restaurant, a building of some antiquity. It was built in the 1780s when the Dam was being constructed and originally served as the house of the Water Board’s solicitor.
Two Bowling greens were constructed in the park shortly after it was opened, a children's playground was built in the 1970s. Both were constructed in a part of the park which was known as the recreation ground, and thus marked on old Ordnance Survey maps, it was an area of quite steep banking built as a dam wall for the reservoir.

Secure Freight Initiative

The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program and part of the SAFE Port Act of 2006. It uses non-intrusive Inspection (NII) and radiation detection technology. It also gathers data to measure trade activity for risk-management and protection of United States international trade. The Secure Freight Initiative builds on the current partnership between the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Department of Energy’s Megaports Initiative. 
The two sides of the Secure Freight Initiative are: the Container Security Initiative, also known as the "International Container Security scanning project" and the Importer Security Filing Program. A third pillar was to have been the Global Trade Exchange (GTX), a data acquisition program which was funded as part of the Homeland Security Budget for 2008 and 2009, but is delayed and remains under study.
The Secure Freight Initiative was kicked off in end-April 2007, with the commencement of the International Container Security project. The ICS is in pilot phases and is working to develop appropriate means to verify the safety of transport containers, using scanning technology including radiation portal monitors, non-intrusive imaging equipment, and optical character recognition systems. ICS is being implemented in foreign ports; Southampton (United Kingdom), Port Qasim (Pakistan), and Puerto Cortez (Honduras) will became the first seaports to implement the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) in October 2007. These ports began by scanning all maritime containers destined for the United States for nuclear or other radiological materials. Data from these systems is then provided to U.S. officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center for analysis. 
A second leg of the SFI came to light vis-a-vis the new Importer Security Filing (ISF) program, also known as “10+2,”. The ISF, "10+2" program was put forth as a risk-management program, part of the DHS strategy to assess and identify high-risk U.S.-bound maritime transport shipments.

Salvia palaestina is a herbaceous perennial native to a wide area including what was historically known as Palestine, (which now includes Israel and the West Bank) and is also native to Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, the Sinai peninsula and northeastern Egypt. It was named and described by George Bentham in 1835, with the specific epithet ("palaestina") referring to its geographical distribution "in Palæstinæ montibus inter Gaza et Jerusalem", or the mountains between Gaza and Jerusalem.
"S. palaestina" grows in a wide variety of habitats, between elevation. It was introduced into horticulture in the 1990s. The plant grows tall, with an upright habit and many square stems growing from basal roots. The mid-green rugose leaves vary in shape and size, with light hairs on both sides, and glands that release a scent when rubbed or crushed. The inflorescences grow candelabra-like at the top of the stems, with 4-6 flowers per whorl. The flowers are straight and tubular, ranging in color from white to pale lilac.

Belize–United States relations

Belize – United States relations have traditionally been close and cordial. The United States is Belize's principal trading partner and major source of investment funds. It is also home to the largest Belizean community outside Belize, estimated to be 70,000 strong. Because Belize's economic growth and accompanying democratic political stability are important U.S. objectives, Belize benefits from the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative.
History.
International crime issues dominate the agenda of bilateral relations between the United States and Belize. The United States is working closely with the Government of Belize to fight illicit narcotics trafficking, and both governments seek to control the flow of illegal migrants to the United States through Belize. Belize and the United States brought into force a stolen vehicle treaty, an extradition treaty, and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between 2001 and 2003.
The United States is the largest provider of economic assistance to Belize, contributing $2.5 million in various bilateral economic and military aid. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) closed its Belize office in August 1996 after a 13-year program during which USAID provided $110 million worth of development assistance to Belize. Belize still benefits from USAID regional programs. In addition, Peace Corps volunteers have served in Belize since 1962. Until the end of 2002, Voice of America operated a medium-wave radio relay station in Punta Gorda that broadcast to the neighboring countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The U.S. military has a diverse and growing assistance program in Belize that included the construction and renovation of several schools and youth hostels, medical assistance programs, and drug reduction programs. Private North American investors continue to play a key role in Belize's economy, particularly in the tourism sector.

<doc id="21567448" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21567448" title="Mường Thanh Valley">
Mường Thanh Valley

The Mường Thanh Valley is a valley located in the Điện Biên district of Northwestern Vietnam. The valley is approximately 12 miles long by 3 miles wide. A heart-shaped basin, the valley is surrounded by a region filled with jungles, rice paddies, and lakes. Located within the Mường Thanh Valley is the city of Dien Bien Phu. The capital of Điện Biên Province, Dien Bien Phu is famous for being the site of a long battle between French and Vietnamese forces between March and May 1954.
Geography and location.
Located in the Điện Biên Province of Northwestern Vietnam, the Mường Thanh valley lies at the crossroads of many different modern political boundaries. Two other Vietnamese provinces border the Điện Biên Province, Lai Châu to the east and north, and Sơn La to the east and south. The northern section of Điện Biên Province borders the province of Yunnan in China and the entire Western border of the province is shared with the Phongsali province of Laos. The valley is located 420 kilometers away from Hanoi.
The Mường Thanh Valley lies in a hilly, lush region. The valley runs north-south and is situated in the western portion of the Điện Biên Province, approximately 16 km from the border with Laos.
Demography and culture.
Approximately 40 percent of the inhabitants of the Điện Biên Province belong to the Thai ethnic minority group. While the delta and coastal plain regions of Vietnam are largely populated by the ethnic majority Vietnamese, also known as the Kinh, the highlands are home to many of Vietnam's ethnic minority groups. Many of the ethnic groups in Northern Vietnam are Chinese-descended. However the Thai, among other ethnic groups that inhabit the Mường Thanh Valley and the surrounding highland regions, are not Chinese-descended. The Thai, along with other ethnic groups that inhabit the Điện Biên Province, are largely independent and follow their own series of customs and traditions. The Thai, among other non-Chinese minority ethnic groups in Vietnam such as the Tay, Nùng, Hmong, Muong, Cham, Khmer, Kohor, E De, Bahnar, and Jarai, have their own languages and writing systems. Belief holds that the Thai are originally descended from lowland natives of Zhuang-Dong origin. They were forced into the highlands by continuous invasions of the Mongoloid people of China.
Much Thai folklore surrounds the history of the Mường Thanh Valley. According to Thai folklore, the Thai originally named the valley Muong Then (the land of God) sometimes spelt Muang Thaeng. The Vietnamese Government provides the following story about the history of the Thai people according to Thai folklore:
While the Thai are the largest single ethnic group in the Mường Thanh Valley, the Hmong, Dao, and Day ethnic groups also inhabit the valley. There is also a substantial population of the Vietnamese ethnic majority group, Kinh, in the city of Dien Bien Phu.
Most of the groups in the regions follow animistic religious beliefs. There are also Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, and Muslims.
Political history.
Due to its location along the border with Laos and near the border with China, the Mường Thanh Valley and the surrounding region has had a long history of invasions and political change.
In the 15th century the troops of Vietnamese Emperor Lê Lợi allied with the indigenous inhabitants to expel the Chinese Ming invaders.
Three hundred years later the Mường Thanh Valley came under the occupation of the Phe people from Laos. The Thai vigorously fought the Phe invaders and finally defeated them in 1751 with help from a peasant leader from Son Nam named Hoang Cong Chat.
Until French rule began, the inhabitants of the Mường Thanh Valley and many of Vietnam's other highland minority groups were quite isolated from the lowland populations. When the French arrived in the nineteenth century they began to consolidate rule and contact between highland regions such as Mường Thanh and the lowland regions increased. The French sought contacts with the Thai and other highland groups in order to cultivate their land. This often led to conflict between the French and the minority groups because the natives did not trust the French.
After independence from the French, the Mường Thanh Valley fell under the rule of the North Vietnamese government and the inhabitants were given a certain degree of autonomy as a compromise for accepting the rule of the central government in Hanoi.
Natural life.
Flowing through the Mường Thanh Valley is the Nam Rom River. The presence of the Nam Rom River in the valley makes the valley region highly fertile. Much of the natural environment of the Mường Thanh Valley is jungle. The non-urbanized land in the valley is now largely used for agriculture, namely rice growing.
Economic development.
While the area surrounding the Mường Thanh Valley is largely rural and undeveloped, the valley itself is developed. The capital of the Điện Biên Province, the city of Dien Bien Phu, is located inside the valley.
The Vietnamese government is working to develop theMường Thanh Valley into a popular tourist destination. Many war veterans and other tourists come to the region to revisit the important sights of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The Vietnamese government is now working to further develop the region's tourist infrastructure and appeal by promoting the diversity of local culture.
The Vietnamese government is advertising local Thai culture in an effort to introduce outsiders to the local culture. In 2004 the Vietnam Administration of Tourism and the Điện Biên Province announced that that year would be the "Year of Dien Bien Tourism". This announcement came with a gift of around US$9500 to each commune in Dien Bien to build a commune hall to host visitors. These communes will showcase and introduce tourists to Thai culture.
Trekking, mountain biking, and other nature-oriented tourist activities are also being promoted in the Mường Thanh Valley.
Additionally, a commercial airport is located in the Mường Thanh Valley. The airport, located in Dien Bien Phu, offers flights to Hanoi.
Rice farming also contributes to the local economy.
Battle of Dien Bien Phu.
The First Indochina War began on December 19, 1946 as a battle between the French trying to regain their colonial claims in Vietnam and the Viet Minh attempting to gain control of the area. In the early 1950s Viet Minh forces were making steady advancements on French-controlled parts of Northern Vietnam. By late 1952 much of the Red River Delta was under Viet Minh control. Due to its proximity to supply routes from China, the Mường Thanh Valley region was vital to the survival and support of the Viet Minh. The French forces in Vietnam under General Henri Navarre sought to occupy Dien Bien Phu. This would allow them to cut off an important supply route to the Viet Minh and also help them to fight against a Viet Minh offensive in Laos.
Thus, in November 1953, French forces occupied the town of Dien Bien Phu and used their nearby military post at Lai Châu for reinforcement. Also during November 1953 the Northern Vietnamese Government indicated that it would examine diplomatic settlement proposals from the French. If the Vietnamese army could successfully attack a French-held zone leading up to the talks that were scheduled for April and May 1954, they felt that they would have enough leverage to broker an acceptable peace agreement. Because of Dien Bien Phu's strategic importance, it was chosen as the stage for this attack.
The siege of Dien Bien Phu began on March 13, 1954. By this date the Viet Minh had approximately 50,000 regular troops, 55,000 support troops in the area. They also had around 100,000 transport workers in Mường Thanh Valley area bringing in Chinese aid. The French garrison at Dien Bien Phu relied on air supply and on March 27 the Viet Minh had destroyed the French airfield. This left the French effectively cut off from the outside world. The Viet Minh had artillery posts and troops set up throughout the valley and were able to continuously assault the French.
The French garrison in Dien Bien Phu surrendered on May 7 after the less-than-two-month assault had cost the lives of around 25,000 Vietnamese and 1,500 French.

Line 4 of the Guangzhou Metro () or Nansha Line () is a north-south line on the system that runs between Huangcun and Jinzhou stations, spanning a total of 43.7 km with 16 stations. It will eventually run from the Guangzhou Science Town to Nansha. The section of the line from Huangcun to Xinzao is underground, while that from Xinzao to Jinzhou is elevated. Line 4's colour is green.
Trivia.
Guangzhou Metro Line 4 is one of only two lines of the Guangzhou Metro which uses Linear Motor Trains. The voltage used is 1.5 kV, which may be the highest voltage used on third rail systems. 750V is the maximum that is considered safe if there is no bottom contact. However, voltages above 1.5kV are not always considered practical for metro systems, due to the requirement for large circuit breakers, though there have been some exceptions to this rule, e.g. the Delhi Metro and the Chennai Metro, which use 25kV overhead electrification.

Point Pedro Electoral District

Point Pedro Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Point Pedro in Jaffna District, Northern Province. Udupiddy Electoral District was carved out of the western part of the district in March 1960. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Point Pedro electoral district was replaced by the Jaffna multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Point Pedro continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

Jeffery Boswall

Jeffery Boswall (20 March 1931 – 15 August 2012) was a British naturalist, broadcaster and educator.
One of the longest serving producers with the BBC Natural History Unit (1957-1987), and the writer and presenter/narrator of many of the programmes he produced, he was also been prominent in the development of the ethics of natural history broadcasting and the encouragement of new entrants into the field. Boswall wrote and produced the first wildlife film shown in colour on the BBC, the "The Private Life of the Kingfisher", filmed by Ron Eastman. It was broadcast in 1967 on BBC2. He was one of the "pioneers of British natural history broadcasting" (Daily Telegraph obituary, 5 September 2012).
Early years.
Jeffery Hugh Richard Boswall was born in Brighton on 20 March 1931. A keen amateur ornithologist, his first published article appeared in the journal British Birds when he was 16. His interest in ornithology arose from a chance suggestion by a friend that he join him bird watching at the River Adur near Shoreham-on-Sea. His first full-time job was as assistant to the Director of Watchers and Sanctuaries for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
BBC Natural History Unit.
Boswall began as a radio producer, upon joining the BBC Natural History Unit in 1957, producing series including "Birds of the Air" and "The Naturalist".
He started to work on television programmes in 1964. He produced the "Look" series (introduced by Peter Scott) from 1963 to 1969, which is the series which made Peter Scott a household name in Great Britain.
Boswall wrote and produced the first wildlife film shown in colour on the BBC, the "Private Life of the Kingfisher", filmed by Ron Eastman and narrated by Peter Scott. It was broadcast in 1967 on BBC2. It won the Silver Medal at the Moscow Film Festival in 1967. It enormous popularity led to it being repeated an unprecedented eight times, as well as to Boswall commissioning a series of 18 programmes on single species in a series known as "Private Lives", ranging from the Jackass Penguin to the Siamese Fighting Fish to the Cuckoo.
He produced and presented "Wildlife Safari to Ethiopia" (1970), a six-part series. It was described by Christopher Parsons, former head of the BBC's Natural History Unit, as "arguably one of the best series of its genre ever made". Boswall went on to produce and present three follow up series: "Wildlife Safari to the Argentine" (1972), "Boswall's Wildlife Safari to Mexico" (1977) and "Boswall's Wildlife Safari to Thailand" (1979).
He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1977.
He wrote, produced and narrated "Animal Olympians" (1980) a one hour special which compared the feats of animals to those of human olympians, as well as celebrating superlative feats from the natural world which have no human analogue. This was broadcast in connection with the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and was for many years in the top 5 sales of BBC programmes internationally.
Other programmes he produced included "Cracking the Egg" (1982), "The Truth behind the Turkey" (1982), "Natural World: Where the Parrots Speak Mandarin" (1986) and "Wild Waterfalls" (1989)
He was series producer for "Birds For All Seasons", a three-part series broadcast in 1986, narrated by Magnus Magnusson. He wrote a book to accompany this series, with David Helton.
He frequently appeared on or contributed to other radio and television programmes, including "Today", "Animal Magic", "Nationwide", and "Wogan".
Ethics of natural history broadcasting.
Boswall is acknowledged as one of the key figures in shaping the approach to ethics in natural history broadcasting. He is credited with establishing two main commandments "Thou shalt not deceive the audience" and "thou shalt not harm nature".
On the latter topic he was quoted in "Discover" magazine in 1985:
When I lecture about this issue, I ask this question: Who would shrink from introducing a living fly into a spider's web to get a shot of the spider feeding on the fly. Usually no one objects to that. Then I carry the same question through the animal kingdom, up to using a monkey as a bait for a boa constrictor. Not many people like that too much. Then I ask - supposing of course that adequate provisions were made for his family - how would you feel about feeding a human to a crocodile? Crocodiles do feed on humans, you know, so it would be "scientifically" correct (original emphasis).
The profession of natural history broadcasting.
Boswall chaired the first six BKSTS International Symposia for Wildlife Filmmakers from 1976 to 1991, being the main forum in the UK for wildlife filmmakers to meet and debate current issues in the profession. Keynote speakers included David Puttnam and Hugh Falkus. This event was merged with Wildscreen from 1994.
In 1992 he became Senior Lecturer in Wildlife Film-making at the University of Derby, probably the first full-time position of its kind in the world. Boswall has taught courses in the UK and internationally on natural history film-making. He appeared on the jury at a number of international wildlife film festivals.
Boswall's overall contribution to natural history broadcasting has been recognised by awards from the Royal Geographic Society and the British Kinematograph Sound and Television Society.
Wildlife sound recording.
In addition to owning one of the largest privately held collections of commercially issued bird voice gramophone records and tapes, Boswall published numerous discographies including sound production by birds, mammals, insects and amphibians.
He was joint author of "The Peterson Field Guide to the Bird Songs of Britain and Europe" and co-founder of the British Library of Wildlife Sounds collection now at the British Library Sound Archive in London.
Other work.
After leaving the BBC in 1987 he became Head of Film and Video at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, producing a variety of programmes including "Mud Matters" (1988), "Eagles - the Majestic Hunters" (1990) and "Flying for Gold" (1992).
Throughout his career he has given frequent public lectures on a variety of natural history topics, including bird song and tool using by birds. He has also led courses since 1988 aimed at those seeking to enter natural history television as a career on how to make wildlife documentaries.
From the 1980s, Boswall was involved in the vanguard of the emerging trend towards eco-tourism, and has led wildlife tours to places as varied as the Galápagos Islands, Ethiopia, Russia and China.
Boswall wrote over 100 articles in scientific journals on natural history subjects. He wrote the annual update on global ornithology for "Encyclopædia Britannica Yearbook" from 1964 to 1998.

The Wind in the Willows (2006 film)

The Wind in the Willows is a 2006 live-action television adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's classic novel "The Wind in the Willows". It was a joint production of the BBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and starred Matt Lucas (Mr. Toad), Bob Hoskins (Badger), Mark Gatiss (Ratty), and Lee Ingleby (Mole), with a cameo appearance from Michael Murphy as the Judge. Rachel Talalay directed. It debuted in Canada on CBC Television on December 18, 2006, in the United Kingdom on BBC1 on 1 January 2007, in the U.S. on PBS's "Masterpiece Theatre" on April 8, 2007 and in Australia on ABC TV on 23 December 2007. It was filmed on location in Bucharest, Romania.
Though the novel is considered children's literature, critics noted that this adaptation might not be appropriate for young children; Ginia Bellafante wrote in "The New York Times" that it "is ultimately too jaunty to be considered 100 percent safe for someone over 10", and David Knox thought it "may well alienate children". However, Variety's Brian Lowry said that its appeal "should run the demographic gamut for PBS, from "Sesame Street" to "Bleak House"."
Critics praised Matt Lucas's portrayal of Mr. Toad. "In ordinary life Mr. Lucas’s frame does not suggest that he is a salad-and-pea-shoots kind of guy, and here he has fun with an exaggerated corpulence that seems to leave him channeling W. C. Fields," wrote Bellafante. David Knox wrote that "Lucas’ performance positively swamps this treatment of the classic story".
Director Rachel Talalay received the 2007 Leo Award for "Best Direction in a Youth or Children's Program or Series" for the film. It was also nominated for the 2007 Satellite Award for "Best Motion Picture Made for Television"

BrightBuilt Barn

A BrightBuilt Barn, is an eco-friendly project that is directed towards creating a more sustainable building. It was first established in Rockport, Maine by Kaplan Thompson Architects and company, when a rich entrepreneur contacted them by the name of Keith Collin. The BrightBuilt Barn is the creator's sample of what a more sustainable building can look like, for people to possibly live in. The idealist Keith Collin and company wanted a sustainable, low cost, and environmentally friendly home. At least that was the Collin's plan,since 2006. So far there are only prototype BrightBuilt houses produced. Collin wants the beginning design to be a pathway towards implying more technological applications into common day houses, to bring better result for the environment, or at least that is his vision. From its inception, the design was driven by five guiding principles: livability, sustainability, replicability, disentanglement, and education. In the eyes of the designers this barn project is a stepping stone toward the future improvements that can start right now, especially since the barns Net Zero design can benefit the environments situation. The benefit could mean more energy is conserved in the years to come, which can help other small towns like Collin's.
History.
Keith Collin the project founder, and funds provider, started off with a thought about a project idea that would make homes more sustainable for the environment. Collin followed through with his plan by contacting Kaplan Thompson Architects. He asked of them to build a studio and workshop, for him and his wife. At first the project seemed like a simple project house, but Collin had a big project about to unroll. He did not want any simple workshop, but instead Collin wanted a type of home that could tackle the climate crisis looming around his town. Something big resulted from all this collaboration between Kaplan Thompson Architects, Bensonwood Woodworking Company, a Who’s-Who team of Maine’s green engineers, and a visionary client. A super green, offsite fabricated net-zero building that can be adapted and replicated over time. All the part-takers hoped the project would become a foundation for future Eco-friendly buildings that would possibly follow their footsteps, or they hoped so. Their goal can be seen a little bit too unreachable, but they all made a great effort to open up more people’s eyes toward innovation. Thus Collin and company pushed forward an effort of sustainability by starting in their small town, and hoping it would spread more throughout the world.
Sustainability.
Waste Improvements.
The barn is 25 percent sustainable, and recyclable. Plus the framing and wood materials that went into the manufacturing came within 250 miles from the site. These features make the Eco-home more ideal in avoiding the use of excess waste materials. Material that could be possibly waste in making typical homes. Collin felt that in this time of day any effort for less waste would be for a better good. The workers who actually put the home together developed a plan of how exactly it was all going to come together before even going to the working place, and they did this to avoid any waste material due to errors.
Infrastructure.
The plumbing fixtures inside this Eco-house are specifically set up to use less water than normal fixtures, plus they are separated from the homes structure to make them more accessible for repairs. Even the landscape of these homes have been set up in a more sustainable manner as they have been set up with native drought tolerant plants, instead of water thirsty grass, which helps the maintenance be even that much less.
Energy Efficiency.
Each component of the building envelope (walls, ﬂoor, ceiling/roof) achieves R-40 insulation, which, in combination with high efﬁciency windows, creates a building tight enough to require NO FURNACE. Having the Eco-home be build to these standards demonstrates the planning that went into the BrighBuilt Barn being as helpful to the plant as possible. These Eco-homes is made more environmentally friendly through their use of R-40 insulation, which just means it has a better than normal thermal resistance, than typical homes. The building is even set up to help calculate the homes performance in two distinct ways. The first way to measure performance is through LED lights around the bottom part of the home that are indicates of the moment to moment energy being used by the home. The second way is three meters set up at the far end of the house to indicates the certain levels of materials being used at the home. Each feature being the designer's effort to keep track of the BrighBuilts homes plan of helping the planet.
The BrightBuilt Barn's LED lightskirt located on the outside bottom edge of the house informs the people inside on how efficiently are they using the energy in the building. 
Significant Features.
Net Zero.
The BrightBuilt home has to reach a lot of standards to get to be defined as Net Zero. First and foremost though it must not use any fossil fuels at all. Furthermost, the home can not use more energy that it actually produces itself. What helps the building the most in reaching Net Zero standards are the R-40 insulated walls, and R-60 insulated roof. The insulation helps with climate changes, as it helps during cold conditions. It's not going to take a lot to keep this place warm.
Low Budget and Attractive.
These BrightBuilt homes can now be replicated in other conditions, and it would be estimated at less than 200,000. This low price comes along with a very nice design, as Collin would say. It doesn't look like a science project. It is extremely attractive, and at the same time it is highly energy-efficient. Not to forget the movable walls, so the inhabitants can remodel it to their preferred design.
Utility Credit.
Since the BrightBuilt barn has such tight insulation, the heat produced by appliances plus the inhabitants can keep it comfortable temperature for the people living there, all year long. Also the solar water heater and connected heat pump work as further heating to the house, helping to make the house produce more than it consumes. This extra energy from Collin's barn, is piped back to the energy company to give him utility credit.
ArchiCAD.
The BrightBuilt barn designers used ArchiCAD to produce a three-dimensional model of the home, and how it would come together perfectly in the virtual world, before they actually went to work on it. This virtual design cut formatted a model to precise detail, plus they even calculated how to get the most sun to hit their solar panels. Every little aspect of the home was determined before hand, the designers were not considering errors as a choice. Even three-dimensional communication was continuously occurring between Brensonwood and designers through the use of ArchiCAD, as they virtually talked from a distant building to the working site.

<doc id="21567677" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21567677" title="Zombie company">
Zombie company

"Zombie company" is a media term for a company that needs constant bailouts in order to operate, or an indebted company that is able to repay the interest on its debts but not reduce its debts. There are several types of zombie companies. The term regained popularity in the media during 2008 for companies receiving bailouts from the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). A 2002 "New York Times" article about Japanese companies kept on "life-support" with loans include a headline that stated, "They're Alive! They're Alive! Not!; Japan Hesitates to Put an End to Its 'Zombie' Businesses."
Usage.
"Zombie company" is used to describe a situation in an economy where a failing company continues to operate with government support, but cannot stand on its own. The term can be traced to Edward Kane's explanation of the situation of insolvent savings and loan associations in the 1980s and of Japanese banks in the early 1990s. During the financial crisis of February 2009, "Newsweek Magazine" gave a down arrow to banks in its conventional wisdom watch section saying, "restructure them now, before we get Japanese-style "zombie banks" stalking a lost decade."
Zombie companies are businesses that, although generating cash, are unable to attract enough investment to start paying off their debts. After covering running costs, fixed costs (wages, rates, rent) they only have enough funds left to pay off the huge interest on their debts, but not the debt itself. This is why they are called "zombie companies" - they are still trading, and so half living, but not able to invest or grow to pay off their debts, which is why they are also considered half dead.
With too little cash to live properly, the company's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has to look out for a subsistence living and therefore wanders from one loan repayment to the next. Zombie firms are loss-making and have little hope of improvement in the imminent future. Therefore, they depend on banks to grant them another loan to survive, effectively putting them on never-ending life support. 
Research from the Institute for Turnaround, the not-for-profit and leading membership body for turnaround and transformation professionals, estimates that there may be up to 100,000 zombie companies in operation in the UK. Zombies are often at an unfair advantage over their non-zombie competitors, because of the trading advantages they receive.

'"The Same Door" is the first collection of John Updike's short stories in book form. It was published in 1959 by Alfred A. Knopf. This was the year after his first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, was published by the same company, a house he was to remain with for 50 years.
Contents.
The book consists of 16 stories, all previously published in The New Yorker between 1954 and 1959, some in somewhat different form according the title page . The stories appeared in the magazine in the order in which they appear in the book.
Themes.
The stories are divided into stories with a boyish protagonist set in an unnamed small town or in Olinger, Pennsylvania—the fictional name Updike gave to his hometown—and stories set mostly in New York and other cities, including London, with a young adult man often at the center.

Reception.
Writing about the author's second collection, Pigeon Feathers, in The New York Times Book Review, critic Arthur Mizener wrote of Updike's early achievement as a whole: 
"John Updike is the most talented writer of his age in America (he is 30 today) and perhaps the most serious. His natural talent is so great that for some time it has been a positive handicap to him — in a small way by exposing him from an early age to a great deal of head-turning praise, in a large way by continually getting out of hand. He has already written five books — two novels ('The Poorhouse Fair' and 'Rabbit, Run'), a volume of verse ('The Carpentered Hen'), and two books of stories ('The Same Door' and this book). Read in chronological order they show clearly the battle that has gone on between his power to dazzle and his serious insight."

Lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water

The discovery of widespread lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water resulted in a Congressional investigation that damaged the scientific reputation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), left thousands of children with lifelong health risks, and led to a re-evaluation of the use of chloramine in public drinking-water systems. Marc Edwards, an expert in plumbing corrosion, discovered lead levels at least 83 times higher than the accepted safe limit while performing research into premature pipe corrosion for the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA). He found that the decision to change from using chlorine to chloramine as a treatment chemical had caused the spike in lead levels. After the "Washington Post" ran a series of front-page articles about Edwards's findings, resulting in widespread public concern, the United States House of Representatives conducted an investigation. The House found that the CDC had made "scientifically indefensible" claims in a report that had indicated there was no risk from the high lead levels. The "Post" investigation uncovered evidence of widespread misreporting of lead levels at water agencies across the United States, leading to regulatory crackdowns and changes in Environmental Protection Agency policies.
The problem was addressed in 2004 by adding additional treatments to the water, preventing the chloramine from dissolving lead in the water mains, solder joints, and fixtures.
In 2010, the CDC reported that 15,000 homes in the Washington, D.C. area might still have water supplies with dangerous levels of lead.
2001–2004: Initial reports of elevated lead.
In 2001, more than half the water samples taken from 53 DC-area homes under the procedures required by the EPA's Lead and Copper Rule showed levels of lead exceeding the national standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb). Lead disrupts the physical and mental development of fetuses, babies, and young children, and can cause kidney problems and high blood pressure in adults. The rule does not assume that there is a "safe" level of exposure, but notes that 15 ppb is an "action level" where utilities must take action. The rule was created in 1991, after research showed that drinking water could account for one-fifth of all lead intake. Lead is not normally present in drinking water; it is released from the inside surface of lead service lines (pipes that run from the main to the house), joints connected with lead-based solder, and lead fixtures inside the house. Based on these findings, WASA was required to notify the public and implement plans to replace lead service lines in key areas of the municipal water system. 
The first media attention came in late 2002, when the "Washington City Paper" ran an article about a resident of American University Park whose water tested six to 18 times the EPA Lead and Copper Rule's action level. WASA found that homes in its service area with lead service lines averaged five times the EPA limit for lead during a year-long period. The results were unexpected; the EPA scientist overseeing DC's water suggested that drought conditions might have raised the alkalinity levels of the Potomac River, leading to a change in the pH of the water. As a result, WASA was required to start replacing seven percent of the district's lead service lines each year until the levels dropped below 0.015 milligrams per liter. At the time, about 23,000 WASA customers had lead service lines.
In March 2003, Marc Edwards, a professor of civil engineering and expert on corrosion in drinking-water systems, was conducting research into an unexpected increase in pinhole leaks in copper water pipes in the DC area. WASA funded Edwards's research. Suspecting the leaks were caused by a change in the water chemistry, Edwards used a field meter to test for lead in one home's water. The meter could read values up to 140 ppb. His initial reading pegged the meter, so he diluted the sample to ten percent of its original strength. Even so diluted, the sample still pegged the meter, indicating the water contained at least 1,250 ppb of lead. "Some of it would literally have to be classified as a hazardous waste," Edwards said.
After Seema Bhat, a water quality manager at WASA, told her superiors at the agency and at the EPA about the lead levels and warned that federal guidelines required aggressive action, she was fired by the agency. A federal investigator found that she had been improperly terminated.
The lead levels required WASA to conduct a wider survey of their water quality. By the fall of 2003, it had tested more than 6,000 homes in the District, finding that two-thirds tested had more than 15 ppb of lead in their water. The survey showed that over 4,000 homes served by WASA had lead levels exceeding the acceptable level. More than a third of the homes surveyed—2,287 out of 6,118—had levels exceeding 50 ppb. The water tested over 300 ppb in 157 homes. Despite this result, WASA did not notify its customers of the risk until November 2003. 
Although regulations required WASA to include the specific warning "Some homes in this community have elevated lead levels in their drinking water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health." in the water bills of each affected customer, WASA's notice omitted key parts of the phrase such as "in their drinking water" and "significant". Although Federal law required WASA to hold public meetings to discuss the problem and actions people could take to protect themselves, they advertised the meetings as being "to discuss and solicit public comments on WASA's Safe Drinking Water Act projects", omitting mention of lead. The EPA was required to review the notice before it was sent out; one D.C. Council member, commenting on the EPA's approval of the faulty notice, asked "Where were you, EPA?" The EPA later found that WASA's notice violated federal law because of the omissions.
In January 2004, the "Washington Post" reported that the mayor and several D.C. Council members had not been informed of the elevated lead levels. The "Washington City Paper" said that Carol Schwartz, the councilmember who chaired the Committee on Public Works and the Environment, was not informed of the lead issue until that newspaper contacted her during the last week of January 2004. Early communications from WASA limited the health advisory to pregnant women and small children in homes with lead service leads, but later tests showed the high lead levels were also present in homes with copper service leads.
Meanwhile, on January 2, 2004, WASA called Edwards and threatened to cut off his access to monitoring data needed for his research, and divert funding from him to other researchers, unless he stopped working with the homeowners whose water showed high lead levels. Soon after, the EPA discontinued its own contract with Edwards.
2004: "Washington Post".
The issue became front page news when the "Washington Post" ran an article titled "Water in D.C. Exceeds EPA Lead Limit" on January 31, 2004 across six columns of page A1. Reporter David Nakamura was contacted by one of the homeowners whose water was tested by WASA during its survey after he received the test results. Nakamura—who had no prior experience with clean water issues—initially thought it was a minor issue, but agreed to help the homeowner get a response from WASA. When WASA would not give him a straight answer, Nakamura pressed them for full data on the tests. Nakamura says that, even though he was "stunned" at the facts reported in that first story, the "Post" "had no idea about the size and scope of what was to follow."
The article quoted Erik Olson, an analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, as saying "This is a really big deal... If schools go over 20 parts per billion, they immediately take the water out of production." WASA recommended that residents let the tap run for 30 seconds to one minute before using it to reduce the risk.
This first "Post" article was the first public mention of the theory that the lead levels were tied to chloramine. The traditional use of chlorine had been stopped four years earlier, out of concerns that it could produce harmful chemicals in the pipes. Long-term exposure to the byproducts from chlorine treatment has been linked with cancer. The paper quoted officials as saying that it was possible chloramine was more corrosive to lead pipes. (In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the Washington Aqueduct that supplies water to WASA, rejected a recommendation to add phosphates to the water to prevent lead leaching in the mid-1990s.) The change to chloramine was made after the EPA issued regulations concerning disinfection byproducts formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in drinking water; the EPA considered these byproducts to be a potential health threat. 
After the first article, the "Post" formed a core team of reporters to investigate the issue. Nakamura was joined by reporters Carol Leonnig, Jo Becker, Avram Goldstein, and D'Vera Cohn; editor Marcia Slacum Greene provided daily oversight. Nakamura was the lead reporter for the breaking news coming from WASA and City Hall, and wrote profiles of key players. Leonnig reported on the federal and EPA response to the contamination. Cohn investigated the Washington Aqueduct angle and worked with water quality and environmental experts. Goldstein covered the DC Department of Health. Becker looked at water quality nationwide.
After the first article appeared, residents inundated WASA's water hotline with calls and overwhelmed water testing laboratories with requests to have their tap water tested for lead contamination. District elected officials immediately called for an emergency public meeting, and established an inter-agency task force with the EPA to investigate and manage the problem. However, messages to the public at the time were often confusing and contradictory: while WASA was suggesting running taps for 90 seconds to flush out any lead, the EPA was demanding that recommendation be changed to ten minutes.
The "Post" article lead WASA to hand out over 30,000 free water filters, hire health experts, and offer free blood tests to residents. Some water fountains were turned off due to lead levels. In 2004, the D.C. Council held 11 oversight hearings on the issue; the US Congress held four. American University claimed that its water was safe to drink, because the larger water mains feeding commercial sites like the college were not made of lead.
After Nakamura's first few stories for the "Post" on the issue, he was contacted by Seema Bhat's attorney. Bhat, who was then fighting her dismissal from WASA, shared thousands of internal documents with Nakamura. The documents, Nakamura said, "provided a fairly clear picture" that WASA had been trying to find a way to avoid the cost of replacing pipes and adding additional chemicals to the water. He said Bhat's documents were critical to the "Post"'s investigation. He recalls that, while reading the documents, the team found WASA memos indicating that they tried to find "clean" houses to test to reduce the apparent average lead level from the testing, but the more they tested, the more "dirty" houses they found.
By April 2004, there were reports of some DC-area homes reaching lead levels of 6,000 ppb to 48,000 ppb.
In June 2004, the EPA cited WASA for a "serious breach" of the law, including withholding six test results showing high lead levels in 2001, dropping half of the homes that had previously tested high for lead levels in subsequent testing, and avoiding homes known to be at high risk for contamination. In July, a WASA-commissioned report supported the "Post"'s claims that the agency had known about the high lead levels for years, but had failed to notify regulators or the public.
In August 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers started adding orthophosphate to the water in hopes of preventing lead leeching. By November, WASA's board of directors had committed to a plan that would replace all of the agency's 23,000 lead pipes by 2010, at a cost of $300 million—starting with 2,800 lead pipes to be replaced in 2005. WASA estimated that the repairs would cost residents $6 to $7 a month. The agency was not legally responsible for the portion of the lead service lines within a homeowner's property lines; however, they offered to perform the work at a set rate, and arranged a low-interest loan program with Wachovia Bank to help homeowners afford the cost. 
By January 31, 2005, the "Post" had run over 200 stories on the issue, amassing thousands of pages of correspondence through the Freedom of Information Act. Gloria Borland, a District resident, testified before Congress: "If the " Post" had not exposed this scandal, our children today would still be drinking lead contaminated water". 
"Post" reporters Nakamura, Leonnig, Cohn, Becker, Craig Timberg, Monte Reel, and Sarah Cohen won the 2005 Selden Ring Award for Investigative Reporting for the articles. Michael Parks, director of USC Annenberg's School of Journalism and Pulitzer Prize-winning former editor of the "Los Angeles Times", said "The "Washington Post"s work was a very important piece of journalism—important to every man, woman and child living in the District of Columbia, drinking its water and thinking it was pure. And it was important to the residents of other cities whose water is contaminated by lead and other toxic substances". The award's cash prize of $35,000 is believed to be the largest in journalism. According to Nakamura, some at the "Post" were surprised to win the award, because of the atypical nature of the "Post"'s investigation. Most winners conduct a long-term investigation and then publish long articles over a few days with the results; the "Post" covered the investigation as a series of beat stories. Nakamura said he had never heard of the Selden Ring Award until the day his editor told him that the team had won it.
2004: The CDC report.
On March 30, 2004, an "MMWR dispatch", "Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water --- District of Columbia, 2004", was made available on the MMWR web site. It was then published by CDC as "MMWR Weekly, April 2, 2004 / 53(12);268-270". The report ""summarizes the results of the preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated water lead levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (BLLs)"". The report describes the background, and the various kinds of blood tests it employed, and explicitly states: ""All blood tests were used in this analysis."" There is no mention at all of any test results not being available, not even in the "caveat" section, where other potential sources of error are discussed.
The report concludes that the high amounts of lead in the drinking water may have led to a slight rise of the blood levels; however, not to the levels of official concern. It also claims that the average levels were sinking. However, the report notes that there is no known "risk free" level, and therefore recommends that efforts should be made to eliminate lead in children's blood entirely.
The report later was strongly criticized, both by Marc Edwards and by the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; see #Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper.
2004–2005: Government hearings.
At an oversight hearing before the House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine was the cause of the elevated lead levels. He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as "lead free" under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine in a way that would increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like organophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.
On March 23, 2004, Anthony A. Williams (the mayor of the District of Columbia) and Carol Schwartz (chair of the DC Council's Committee on Public Works and the Environment) wrote a letter to President George W. Bush, asking the federal government to reimburse WASA $24,093,700 and the District of Columbia $1,730,401 to cover expenses from the lead contamination. The letter justified the request for full reimbursement by saying "the regulatory decisions of EPA appear to have generated these costs" and that it would be "inherently unfair" for taxpayers and WASA customers to pay those costs. In 2005, President Bush proposed cutting the EPA's budget by almost a half-billion dollars, mostly from clean-water programs. He wanted to decrease spending on replacing aging water facilities by 83 percent.
On March 30, 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that found the lead "might have contributed a small increase in blood lead levels." The report claimed that no children with dangerously high blood lead levels were found, even in the homes with the worst lead levels. Officials in other cities, such as New York and Seattle, cited the report as justification for a less-than-aggressive response to high lead levels in their own water. Water testing in the first six months of 2004 showed 90 percent of homes having 63 ppb of lead or less in the water.
In October 2004, Edwards co-authored an article in the "Journal of the American Water Works Association" that linked chloramine use with greatly increased lead leaching.
A report commissioned by the D.C. Council released on December 8, 2004 faulted the federal government's regulation of the city's water supply as a factor in the lead contamination. The report noted that no one agency was responsible for the water quality: The Army Corps of Engineers treated the water, WASA delivered it, and the EPA performed the quality checks. It urged the Council to assume authority for the entire system. In the last six months of 2004, 90 percent of homes tested had lead levels of 59 ppb or lower.
The city's interim inspector general, Austin A. Andersen, released a report on WASA's performance in January 2005. Andersen called for WASA to enter a formal agreement with the city's Health Department to ensure that future communications about water health issues were timely and worded appropriately. WASA rejected the need for such an agreement. That same month, the Architect of the Capitol issued a warning to Capitol Hill employees that they should not use water from bathroom or kitchen faucets for drinking or cooking. Some water fountains on the campus were turned off, although employees were told it was okay to continue using the others. One home on Capitol Hill was found to have 308 ppb of lead in 2003.
On January 21, 2005, the EPA ordered WASA to notify more than 400 homeowners that the agency had mistakenly told them their house's water lead levels were safe, and to replace an additional 500 service lines to comply with federal law. The EPA said that WASA had flushed the water line for five minutes before running the lead tests for those homes, resulting in artificially low readings; such a lengthy flush is not permitted by EPA standards. The EPA did not believe that the flushes were done intentionally by WASA to reduce lead levels. The testing had been done as part of an effort to avoid the expense of replacing lead lines in areas where it found low lead levels.
2004: Other cities investigated.
In 1999, an EPA survey estimated that the United States's drinking-water systems were in need of $150 billion worth of repairs over the following 20 years. However, in April 2004, an EPA spokesperson told the "Washington Times" that "high lead levels are not a pervasive problem". At a Congressional hearing that month, the EPA testified that it had no current information on lead levels in 78 percent of the nation's water systems, and that as many as 20 states had not provided any data.
On October 5, 2004, the "Washington Post" ran a front-page article reporting that cities across the United States were illegally manipulating lead testing results, such as discarding high readings or avoiding homes likely to have high readings. A former EPA official described it as "widespread fraud and manipulation" on the part of water utilities. That July, however, an EPA administrator told Congress that "we have not identified a systemic problem". Using data from the EPA, the "Post" identified 274 utilities that had reported unsafe lead levels between 2000 and 2004. Some utilities defended their testing practices as being approved by state regulators; others argued that the lead was actually leaching from customers' fixtures, not their plumbing.
Among the cities that the "Post" faulted through the EPA data were:
The "Post" article led the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York to open an investigation into the city's drinking-water lead levels. Regulators in Michigan and Oregon also investigated utilities singled out by the "Post" in those states. Senators James M. Jeffords and Paul S. Sarbanes called for the EPA to impose tougher standards; Jeffords and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for an investigation of the EPA following the "Post"'s findings.
Seattle had already suffered widespread lead contamination in its public school system in 2003. One parent, a scientist who had initiated the investigation there, said "we continue to suffer from an epidemic of lead complacency" nationwide.
The EPA said that between 2003 and 2005, only four large water systems had unsafe lead levels: Washington, DC; St. Paul, Minnesota; Port St. Lucie, Florida; and Ridgewood, New Jersey.
2005–2006: Lower lead levels.
By January 2005, a year after the high lead levels were publicized by the "Post", advocates were calling for the firing of local and federal officials involved in the issue, saying that they had done too little to fix the problem. Eric Olsen of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that officials "have fallen down on the job" because thousands of residents still had unsafe water. The group Lead Emergency Action for the District called for an overhaul of WASA's management, an independent study of needed improvements to the water system, stronger laws, and action from the EPA. "We want fines and a criminal review," said Olsen.
In March 2005, the EPA proposed changes strengthening the Lead and Copper Rule. The changes require utilities to give test results directly to homeowners, and to notify state and federal regulators before changing water-treatment methods. Critics, such as Clean Water Action, called the changes "revisions at the margins". Rick Maas, co-director of the Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina, said the revisions would "solve maybe 5 to 10 percent of the problem" with the Rule. Trade organizations, such as the American Water Works Association, found the changes "basically reasonable".
That month, WASA said that recent tests showed encouraging declines in lead levels, which it attributed to the orthophosphate treatments started in August 2004. Out of 51 homes tested, only four had readings above 15 ppb; ten of those homes were above the 15-ppb standard the previous year, but fell below it in this test. WASA also noted that the Army Corps of Engineers would continue using chloramine throughout the year to keep the water chemistry stable. By May 10, 2005, the company was announcing that its tests were "below the '90th percentile lead action level.'"
As of January 2006, WASA said that about 29 percent of its customers had chosen to replace the lead service lines within the customer's property. In a January press release, WASA said that the average lead level in its most recent tests was 7 ppb. The authority also claimed that a voluntary blood-lead-level screening it funded showed no identifiable public health impact from the elevated lead levels.
The EPA formally reduced its oversight of WASA in May 2006, after testing showed the lead levels had remained below 15 ppb for a full year. However, the agency continued to require WASA to submit 100 samples every six months for at least another year; the normal requirement is 50 samples a year.
Even after the lead levels abated, the "Post" continued to note other problems with the District's water supply. In 2007, it noted that WASA's periodic "chlorine surge" resulted in high levels of haloacetic acids, a chlorine disinfection byproduct believed to be unsafe. Utilities use annual or biannual chlorine surges to remove pathogens such as cryptosporidium that are not adequately killed by chloramine. Independent testing by the Environmental Working Group showed 40 percent of samples exceeded federal safety limits for chlorine byproducts, but officials from the Washington Aqueduct and WASA said the levels were probably temporary and that the water was safe to drink.
2006–2010: EPA, CDC, expert reports faulted.
In January 2006, the Government Accountability Office released a study criticizing the EPA's efforts monitoring lead levels in drinking water across the United States. Although the study found that lead in drinking water had generally declined since the 1990s, it noted that data collection problems "may be undermining the intended level of public health protection".
Guidotti paper.
In 2007, the journal "Environmental Health Perspectives" published a paper about the public health response to the lead contamination, written by a team of academic investigators headed by Tee Guidotti of George Washington University. Guidotti and his team had been hired as consultants by WASA in 2004; he had told the WASA board that water only accounts for seven percent of the typical two-year-old child's lead exposure. The paper analyzed data from the 2004 screening program, identifying sources of confounding or bias. Four indicators were examined, and none showed evidence that blood lead levels had been affected by the elevation of lead in drinking water. The investigators concluded that the evidence did not clearly demonstrate a correlation between lead in the District's drinking water and blood lead levels. However, they cautioned that a population study was not suitable for establishing such relationships. They called for reduction in exposure from water as well as from other sources. The paper stated "There appears to have been no identifiable public health impact from the elevation of lead in drinking water in Washington DC in 2003 and 2004."
The Guidotti paper was called into question by members of the DC Council in February 2009, after the "Washington Post" ran an article about a more recent study by Marc Edwards that found a correlation between water and blood lead levels in area children. The National Institutes of Health, publisher of the journal in which the paper appeared, were unaware that George Washington University's contract with WASA gave the water authority final approval over anything Guidotti wrote concerning the authority. Guidotti was also supposed to remove the sentence about public health impact from the paper before publication, because experts reviewing the paper had rejected that finding; he failed to do so. Guidotti and WASA both denied that the agency influenced the paper; Guidotti said he didn't view the contract as giving WASA preapproval over the paper, and therefore didn't disclose it to the journal. In an August 2006 e-mail obtained by the "Post" from Edwards, Guidotti agreed to replace the sentence with "Measures to protect residents from exposure to lead in drinking water may have prevented more frequent elevations in blood lead" before its publication, but that did not happen. The journal refuses to accept research that is under a sponsor's control; it conducted a review to determine if the paper should be retracted—the journal's first such review in its 30-year history. The paper had been cited as evidence that the lead contamination had not harmed District residents.
In an e-mail to the "Washington City Paper", Guidotti refuted any claims that WASA influenced the team's findings. He clarified that WASA's contract was with the university, not Guidotti personally. He said "The data in our 2007 study are valid, the analysis was accurately reported, and we stand by the conclusions."
The review panel convened by "Environmental Health Perspectives" released its findings in June 2009, finding that the controversial sentence was included due to "inattention to detail" and found no evidence that Guidotti was trying to mislead readers. The panel recommended that Guidotti submit an apology and correction; he did so. The panel said it found evidence that neither Guidotti nor WASA intended for the utility to exercise approval over the research conclusions.
Edwards paper.
The March 1, 2009 issue of "Environmental Science and Technology" included a paper by Marc Edwards, Simoni Triantafyllidou, and Dana Best that established a link between the elevated lead levels in the drinking water and potentially harmful blood lead levels in area children. The "Washington Post" announced the results of that study on January 27, 2009. The report found that 42,000 children who were in the womb or under age 2 during the contamination are at risk of health and behavioral problems. In some areas, the number of children with enough lead to cause irreversible IQ loss and developmental delays more than doubled between 2000 and 2003. These findings contradicted previous statements by WASA that there were no health impacts, as well as the 2004 CDC MMWR report. David Bellinger, a Harvard University neurologist, told the "Post", "If these data were available previously, I would be surprised that anyone would be assuring the public there was no problem."
The CDC refused to provide Edwards with the data necessary to perform the study. He convinced the Children's National Medical Center to share the data with him in 2008.
The paper won the Editor's Choice Award for Best Science Paper of 2009 from the editors of "Environmental Science and Technology".
Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper.
Edwards's study raised new questions about the March 2004 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that downplayed the health impact of the lead contamination. "Salon" noted that the CDC had found a link between lead pipes and high childhood blood lead levels in the district in 2007, but did not publicize the study. The principal author of the 2004 study—Mary Jean Brown, who co-authored the 2007 study—acknowledged that thousands of blood tests were missing from the 2004 study, but defended the paper's conclusion that any harm was slight. "There is no indication that DC residents have blood lead levels above the CDC levels of concern", she wrote.
However, Edwards's results came from analysis of the same data used for the 2004 CDC report. When he wrote to the CDC's associate director of science, questioning the report's conclusions and methodology, he received a belated reply: "We have examined CDC's role in the study and have found no evidence of misconduct."
The United States House of Representatives' Science and Technology Committee opened a congressional investigation into the 2004 CDC report. Investigators found that although the CDC and city health department reported dangerous lead levels in 193 children in 2003, the actual number was 486 according to records taken directly from the testing laboratories. Representative Brad Miller of North Carolina called the CDC report's data "wildly incomplete". The underreported results came from the city's health department, which had said the missing tests were omitted because some labs did not report low lead levels to the city. The health department data was also the basis for Guidotti's paper.
The investigation found that the CDC knowingly used flawed data in drafting the report, leading to "scientifically indefensible" claims in the 2004 paper. It also cited the CDC for failing to publicize later research showing that the harm was more serious than the 2004 report suggested. After the investigation's findings were released, the CDC initially stood by the report's findings that no significant harm was caused by the lead, but acknowledged that the claim that no children with lead poisoning had been found was "misleading". Edwards called for the CDC to retract the paper and for Brown's resignation. "If you were a child living in D.C. at that time, a single glass of tap water could have elevated your blood lead to unsafe levels," said Edwards.
The report strongly criticized Brown for failing to check the original lab results. It also noted that one section of the 2004 CDC report said not one of the people living in a home with water lead levels 20 times higher than the action level had elevated blood lead, but it failed to mention that most of those people were drinking bottled or filtered water, not tap water, before their blood was tested—a fact Brown and her co-authors were well aware of. The investigation found that Brown gave her fellow authors just three hours to review her work before it was submitted for publication.
A year after the "Washington Post" published the results of the investigation, the CDC published a "Notice to Readers" in the May 21, 2010 issue of the "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" admitting that the 2004 report was misleading. It said the original report "did not reflect findings of concern from the separate longitudinal study that showed that children living in homes serviced by a lead water pipe were more than twice as likely as other DC children to have had a blood lead level ≥10 µg/dL." A further Notice to Readers published in June 2010 clarified that the results in the 2004 report "should not be used to make conclusions about the contribution of water lead to blood levels in DC, to predict what might occur in other situations where lead levels in drinking water are high, or to determine safe levels of lead in drinking water." 
The "Post" described the CDC's Notice to Readers as "a full vindication" for Edwards, who spent tens of thousands of dollars out of his own pocket to fund his research, and who was the target of attempts to besmirch his professional reputation by the CDC and EPA. Tom Sinks, the deputy director of the CDC's national center for environmental health, told the Post "Looking backward six years, it's clear that this report could have been written a little better".
In 2010, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UAS) claimed that the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning had been expected to lower the action level for lead in drinking water below 10 micrograms per deciliter in the summer of 2002. According to the UAS, Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, took the unprecedented step of rejecting a number of nominees to the committee selected by staff scientists. Instead, the group claims, Thompson appointed at least two appointees with financial ties to the lead industry. A 2010 "Washington Post" editorial cited the group's statement as a reason why the District's lead contamination "was practically inevitable" due to politicization of the CDC. 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Delegate to Congress representing the District, accused the CDC of a coverup. Jim Graham, a member of the DC Council, said "To now learn that the Centers for Disease Control not only got it wrong but may have intentionally misled District residents and our water agency is the ultimate betrayal of the public trust".
A 2010 study by Brown at the CDC essentially confirmed Edwards's findings. It also found that the 15,000 "partial pipe replacements" performed by WASA—where lead service lines were replaced up to a homeowner's property line, but no further—may not have effectively reduced lead levels, and may have made the problem worse. WASA spent $97 million to replace 17,000 pipes, including the 15,000 partial replacements. A "Post" article about the report lead to jammed phone lines at WASA and increased demand for bottled-water delivery. The study indicated that there is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and that children in homes with even a partial lead service line are at a much higher risk of lead poisoning than those with no lead in the line. WASA said the finding "is not news" to them; General Manager George Hawkins told WAMU that the utility had been acting as if the CDC's findings were fact for some time before the report was released. Hawkins said that WAMU was not seeing elevated levels of lead in homes with partial pipe replacements.
John Parkhurst, et al. lawsuit.
On February 17, 2009, John Parkhurst, the father of twin boys living on Capitol Hill, through his attorneys Stefanie Roemer and David Sanford of Sanford, Wittels & Heisler, filed a class action lawsuit against WASA in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeking $200 million in compensatory damages plus punitive damages. Parkhurst, a 50-year-old single father and psychologist, prepared food and formula for the boys using tap water from the time they were 8 months old until 2002, when they were two years old. The complaint was later amended to add additional five children, on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all children who, at any time from 2000 to 2004, while six years of age or younger, consumed water supplied by WASA that passed through a line containing lead (whether directly or prenatally through their birth mothers), and who had blood-lead levels of 10μg/dl or higher. The suit claims that WASA "undertook Herculean efforts to shield itself from liability and to otherwise deny responsibility". Contemporary news reports indicated that WASA had not seen the lawsuit at the time the story broke, but included comments from WASA spokespeople that more studies would be needed before lead in drinking water could be linked to health and behavioral issues. The agency said that such claims would need to be substantiated on a case-by-case basis. WASA's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in October 2009. In 2012 the named plaintiffs on the case sought to make the case a class action, but on April 8, 2013, judge Anthony C. Epstein denied their motion for class certification stating that the "class of tap water drinkers under 7 years old with elevated blood lead levels was too broad", and that it was not clear the class had or even possibly would suffer any injury.

Salvia patens

Salvia patens (sometimes called gentian sage or spreading sage) is a herbaceous perennial that is native to a wide area of central Mexico. It was introduced into horticulture in 1838 and popularized by William Robinson.
Description.
"Salvia patens" is tuberous, and easily lifted for overwintering in a greenhouse. The more common varieties reach tall and wide, and are covered with hastate shaped mistletoe-green leaves. Inflorescences reach or longer, rising well above the leaves. pure blue flowers are spaced along the inflorescence, with a green calyx that adds to the attractiveness of the flowers.
The specific epithet "patens" means "spreading".
Cultivation.
"Salvia patens" is frequently treated as an annual by gardeners due to its sensitivity to hard frost, with bedding plants often put out in spring. Varieties have been developed with colors ranging from white to lilac to various shades of blue. Seeds from the Netherlands have been available since the 1990s for rich colored and large flowered varieties. 
The species and its cultivar 'Cambridge blue' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. William Robinson praised the species in the 1933 edition of "The English Flower Garden" as, "doubtless, the most brilliant in cultivation, being surpassed by and equalled by few other flowers." A collecting trip to Mexico in 1991 led by James Compton discovered a tall variety with large deep blue flowers that is available as 'Guanajuato'.

Shadow life

Shadow life is a theory proposed by Paul Davies, which suggests that life may exist on Earth which has no evolutionary connection with any form of life currently known to science. If shadow life actually exists, this would greatly increase the prior probability of extraterrestrial life developing on other Earth-like planets.

The Prophet Murders

The Prophet Murders ("Peygamber Cinayetleri" in Turkish) is a Turkish detective fiction novel by Mehmet Murat Somer originally published in Turkish by İletişim Yayınları in 2003 and in English by Serpent's Tail in 2008. It is the first published entry in the author’s Hop-Çiki-Yaya series about an unnamed transvestite amateur detective in Istanbul.
Publishing history.
Somer wrote “The Prophet Murders” along with two other novels in the Hop-Ciki-Yaya series back-to-back in 2001, after health problems forced him into semi-retirement, but had trouble finding a publisher as, “His characterisation of radical Islamic groups proved a tough sell for small publishing companies.” Finally Iletisim Yayinlari, who had published one of Somer’s favourite books, "My Name is Red" by Orhan Pamuk, agreed to take on the project commencing in 2003 with this the second book in the series, and Somer credit the prestigious company's stamp of approval with, “protecting the books from a hostile reception." Serpent’s Tail published Kenneth Dakan’s English translation of this novel in 2008 with Somer stating that, “I believe, the Nobel prize Orhan Pamuk won, opened the international door for Turkish writers, including me."
Synopsis.
The narrator sets out to investigate the mysterious death of two of the employees at the transvestite nightclub she runs, only two discover that they are part of a larger sequence of murders of transvestites named after the prophets.
Reviews.
"This is heady ground," according to Peter Millar of "The Times", “for a camp comedic thriller, especially when it is littered with references to rampant homosexual practice." "The novel promises at first to be as screamingly camp as its hero/ine's wardrobe," agrees Jake Kerridge of "The Daily Telegraph", “but turns out to be quite sober and thoughtful, witty rather than arch and restrained even when filthy." 
"The mystery part of "The Prophet Murders" unwinds fairly predictably: it's a paint-by-the-numbers work in that respect,” states "The Complete Review", “though competently enough done to satisfy most fans of the genre." "I couldn't have cared less ‘whodunit’ in The Prophet Murders,” confirms Chris Wiegand of "The Guardian" as, "Somer says he considers plot secondary to character and atmosphere."
"The real appeal of the novel," agrees "The Complete Review", "is in the milieu it describes, and in the main character. The narrator is an entertaining figure, immersed in the transvestite scene but also understanding that aspects of it are hard to take entirely seriously." "Somer's effervescent hero sashays and shimmies around town," confirms Wiegand and, "The hero's investigations are frequently put on hold for trips to the beauty salon." "Many of the queens are ridiculously dim and/or fussy," states "The Complete Review", "making for an amusing cast of characters (though even this gets a bit monotonous)," but Wiegand concludes that, “the novel's lively cast and punchy chapters kept me gripped."
According to Wiegand, "Somer also colours his crime plot with dashes of social commentary and comedy." “Fairly daringly, Somer also brings the religious issues to the fore, describing a society of homosexuals repressed by the demands and precepts of the prevalent religion -- and the sometimes very unpleasant consequences thereof,” confirms "The Complete Review" before concluding that, "It's no surprise that the prophet-murderer behind the crimes has issues which are grounded in the fundamentals of this society.".
"Its portrayal of Istanbul's alternative scene makes one glad to feel one's life comparatively dull," states Kerridge and according to Millar, "As such it is a healthy and well-timed reminder that our stereotypes can be well wide of the mark, as well as a chilly amusing high-adrenalin romp through what seems at times like an alternative universe." "Fairly amusing, with a few uncomfortably graphic scenes, "The Prophet Murders" is an unusual exotic murder mystery,” summarises "The Complete Review", “Somer has a nice, easy-going tone and manner (though it too often doesn't go anywhere far) and there's certainly potential for the series."

<doc id="21567802" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21567802" title="Hendler Creamery (cable-car powerhouse), Baltimore, MD.">
Hendler Creamery (cable-car powerhouse), Baltimore, MD.

Hendler Creamery (cable-car powerhouse) is a historic industrial complex in Baltimore, Maryland. Since it spans an entire block it has addresses at 1100 E. Baltimore St. and 1107 E. Fayette St. "The Hendler Creamery is historically significant for its contribution to the broad patterns of history in three areas of significance: transportation, performing arts, and industry." 
Jonestown neighborhood.
The Hendler Creamery lies in the Jonestown neighborhood of Southeast Baltimore. The neighborhood lies north of Little Italy, and east of Downtown Baltimore. Jonestown was laid out in 1732 on divided into twenty lots on the east side of the Jones Falls. Today it is an area of industrial, commercial and residential buildings.
From the 1830s to just after World War II, it was a very Jewish enclave, first with Germans and then later with Eastern Europeans. Old "Corned Beef Row" along East Lombard Street was filled with delicatessens, butcheries, and other food markets and shops up until the 1980s. A variety of cultural and educational institutions also served the crowded neighborhoods. Recalling this heritage are the historic synagogues (Lloyd Street and B'nai Israel) and the Jewish Museum of Maryland.
In the last half of the 20th century, Jonestown became an African American neighborhood. Public housing replaced many of the former rowhomes and townhouses throughout the area. In the early 2000s, though, contemporary row housing replaced the public housing. Today Jonestown is home to Baltimore's Central Post Office, in addition to eight Baltimore City Landmarks, including the Flag House and the Phoenix Shot Tower, both Registered National Historic Landmarks.
Construction and architect, Jackson C. Gott.
The Hendler Creamery consists of two adjacent building complexes. The original three-story brick Richardsonian Romanesque building was constructed as a cable car powerhouse in 1892, replacing five old houses on the site. This use necessitated massive arched doors and a mezzanine floor. The construction is of red face brick with red mortar joints and Potomac red Seneca stone trim, and contains much architectural detailing. The front on East Baltimore Street includes four large contiguous Romanesque Revival half-round arched openings with our pairs of rectangular window openings directly above these. In reviewing plans for the building, the Baltimore Sun wrote at the time that it would be one of the most prominent structures in that part of the city and continued, "Economy, durability and simplicity are the controlling motives of the design, and a practical power-house, with a proper regard for architectural proportions and effect, without unnecessary ornamentation, is expected to be the result." 
Additions were built in 1915-20 and 1949. It is also connected to a one-story brick building built in the 1960s. The second building complex is a brick warehouse structure built from 1923 to 1927.
The architect was Jackson C. Gott, a Baltimore based architect who is survived by eight buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the same year the Jonestown cable-car powerhouse was built, Gott also designed the currently named Charles Theatre building on North Charles Street, also for the Baltimore City Passenger Railway. It too served as a cable-car powerhouse, in this case for the BCPR's 2.2 mile Blue Line, which ran north-south, essentially along Charles Street, from South Street to 25th street. In the 1890s Gott further designed two other well-known extant Baltimore buildings: the Maryland Penitentiary, now the Metropolitan Transition Center (1894), and the Southern District Police Station at 28 E. Ostend St. (1896).
Cable-car powerhouse.
As a cable-car powerhouse for the Baltimore City Passenger Railway Company from 1892 to 1898, the building played an important role in Baltimore's transportation history as cable-car mass transit was developed to replace the horse-car. According to the Maryland Historical Trust, the building powered the run of cable from Gay Street to North Avenue, using two Reynolds compound non-condensing Corliss steam engines, 24" + 38" x 60". These propelled a sheave which pulled a continuous loop of cable and moved the car at a speed of around 11 MPH. Just like a subway line today, this line was designated by a color, the Red Line, and ran from North Avenue, down Gay Street, around to Baltimore Street, Bank Street and Patterson Park. The total mileage was 10.7.
Electric cars began replacing cable cars on the Red Line on August 30, 1898 as a more economical and faster means of mass transit. Cables were removed immediately, but the expense of extracting the underground pulleys, sheaves and other fittings was too much, and in most instances they were just covered over as streets were resurfaced. With the switchover, The Baltimore City Passenger Railway Company was absorbed into Baltimore's trolley monopoly, United Railways and Electric Company, and power was generated at the Pratt Street Power Plant. UREC held onto the building for a few years, using the rear half as a "trouble station" for trolleys and renting out the front to the US Navy (Maryland) Naval Reserves for use as a drill-room.
In all, the two Baltimore cable-car companies, Baltimore Traction Company (BTC) and Baltimore City Passenger Railway (BCPR), built six powerhouses, three each. This was a very significant capital expense for an enterprise that only lasted from 1891 to 1899. Of the three and a half surviving powerhouses, the Hendler Creamery is the only one listed on the National Register. As mentioned above, another Gott designed powerhouse survives today as the Charles Theatre (BCPR), while the third totally extant powerhouse (BTC) lies three blocks south at 1110 East Pratt Street. The latter was most recently used as the Pratt Street Garage of the Baltimore City Department of Solid Waste. It is now boarded up and waiting some kind of adaptive re-use. It stretches a full block, between East Pratt and Granby Streets, and is surrounded by Albemarle Square, a 15 block area that revitalizes both a public housing project and the surrounding neighborhood.
While not having the architectural flair of Stanford White's nine story Beaux-Arts Cable Building on Broadway in New York City, the Hendler Creamery is one of the absolute gems of the American cable powerhouses that have survived. For the most part these structures evidenced utilitarian, warehouse style construction, which can be seen clearly in the extant LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse (Chicago).
The only other architecturally significant Baltimore cable-car powerhouse, the former Baltimore Traction Company's Druid Hill Avenue powerhouse and car burn, lost half its structure in 2005 in a spectacular 5 alarm blaze. It is a massive Victorian Romanesque-style brick-and-stone structure. The Epworth Powerhouse (BTC) on Mosher Street in West Baltimore had been torn down years before (see drawing below in gallery). It is a lesson in a site's metamorphoses: going from a church to a powerhouse to a dry cleaning plant, and finally, after demolition, to a high-rise apartment building today.The last powerhouse (BCPR) on South Eutaw, south of West Baltimore, succumbed long ago to the pressures of urban redevelopment.
Yiddish theatre and James Lawrence Kernan.
After the replacement of the cable car by electric trolleys, the Hendler Creamery was then converted into a performance space by Baltimore-born James Lawrence Kernan (1838-1912). He was a theater manager, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, who earlier in his life had fought for the Confederates, been captured and held as a prisoner till the war's end at the brutal Point Lookout Prisoner-of-War Camp at the confluence of the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River. Returning to civilian life, among other ventures, he started a combination hotel and German Rathskeller and founded a hospital, which survives today as the University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute.
Under Kernan's ownership, a second floor, containing an auditorium and dressing rooms, was installed above the first-floor engine room. He named it the Convention Hall Theater. It operated primarily as a Yiddish theater from 1903 to 1912, serving the largely Jewish immigrant population. Some of the city's earliest motion pictures were also shown here by Kernan. Yiddish theater was first performed in Baltimore in the mid-1880s at Concordia Hall, an aristocratic club of Baltimore German Jews. It burnt down in 1891.
The building's conversion to a theater links it to Baltimore's early-20th century performing arts history, which includes melodrama, movies, opera, vaudeville, as well as the Yiddish theater.
Hendler Ice Cream Company.
The building's most important and longest historical legacy came when it was purchased by the Hendler Ice Cream Company in 1912 for $40,000 and converted to the country's first fully automated ice cream factory.
Besides producing one of Baltimore's favorite brands of ice cream, it played a major role in the development of the nation's ice cream business. Many important pioneering industry innovations were developed over the next 50 years in this building, including new kinds of packaging; the blade sharpener, which produced smoother ice cream; and fast freezing, which allowed ice cream to be frozen with a liquid cream texture. The adjoining building at 1107 East Fayette Street, built in the 1920s as part of the Hendler Creamery complex, is also significant, notably in the creation of one of the nation's first ice cream delivery systems by refrigerated truck. As the Maryland Historical Society noted in a blog posting, "The Velvet Kind: The Sweet Story of Hendlers Creamery", "The ice cream was virtually everywhere in Maryland, as it was distributed to over 400 stores at the company’s peak, which kept the production lines humming. The factory ran six days a week with vanilla ice cream being made almost everyday. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry were production mainstays, but the creamery dabbled in more exotic flavors as well. Hutzler's department store sold several varieties, including ginger and peppermint. For the Southern Hotel, Hendlers supplied a tomato sorbet which was served as a side dish rather than dessert. The eggnog ice cream was produced each year at Christmas time. Hendler made with real rum, was a major hit. The factory also cranked out other holiday-themed products, such as an Independence Day treat made with vanilla, strawberry, and blueberry ice creams and a Mother’s Day cake topped with a silk screen of James McNeill Whistler’s portrait of his mother." 
The creamery closed in the 1970s. The nearby Jewish Museum of Maryland has an extensive archive of Hendler Company and family memorabilia.
Historic preservation designation.
The Hendler Creamery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
$45 million adaptive re-use project in 2014.
Following a fourth incarnation as a warehouse and city social services agency, the Hendler Creamery buildings are now (as of the spring of 2014) facing a new prospect. The Commercial Group, a Maryland-based real estate and construction company, bought the building in 2012 for $1.08 million, and is planning a $45 million adaptive re-use, featuring 276 units, along with up to 11,000 sq ft of retail. The project includes exclusive amenities such as multiple outdoor courtyards, a pool deck overlooking the Baltimore skyline, basketball courts, and a yoga studio. Kirby Fowler, president of Downtown Partnership of Baltimore Inc., said redevelopment of the Hendler building would be the next chapter in a decade-long revival for Jonestown. “When you think about what that area used to be like 12 years ago, we’ve gone lightyears toward improvement,” Fowler said. “Albermarle Square four blocks away is this incredibly progressive mixed-income project that came as the result of some HUD money and federal support, and it’s really helped expand Little Italy and Fells Point further north. There’s already progress heading in that direction, and this just continues that.” 
Baltimore City officials have said that they view this location—two blocks east of the iconic Shot Tower, seven blocks west of the bustling campus of The Johns Hopkins Hospital and nine blocks north of the contemporary mixed-use development project Harbor East—as critical to attractively tying together the Hopkins medical facilities and Downtown Baltimore.

Edmund Maynard

Edmund Anthony Jefferson Maynard (10 February 1861 – 10 January 1931) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire from 1880 to 1887 and captained the side for two seasons.
Maynard was the son of Edmund Gilling Maynard, of West House, Chesterfield. He was educated at Harrow School, where he was a member of the cricket eleven in 1879 and played his first game for Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1880. He was at Trinity College, Cambridge and played cricket for Cambridge University Cricket Club from 1881 to 1883. After leaving Cambridge he travelled extensively, shooting bear in the Rocky Mountains in 1882, and ibex and other species of deer in India and Kashmir in 1883 and 1884. He played regularly for Derbyshire from 1880 to 1887, appearing in 37 matches. He captained the side in 1885 and 1886 and for part of 1887. He also played occasionally for MCC. He was a right arm batsman and a slow right hand bowler.
Maynard played 47 first-class matches and had 85 innings for Derbyshire and Cambridge University together. His highest score was 84, but his batting average was 8.88. As a bowler he delivered 68 balls for 53 runs, completing four maiden overs and taking 2 wickets. His bowling average was therefore 26.5. After Maynard's term as captain, Derbyshire were dropped from the league.
Maynard became a Justice of the Peace for Derbyshire. He was a keen rider to hounds and hunted with the Fitzwilliam Hunt at Cambridge, the Rufford Hunt, and the Meynell Hunt. In 1907 he bought Hoon Hall near Hilton, Derbyshire, and demolished the old building to create a new family home in the Arts and Crafts style. He named this Hoon Ridge, and many years later it became a Rest Home.
Maynard died at Hoon Ridge aged 69.
In 1887 Maynard married Margaret Blanche Sitwell, elder daughter of Mr. R. S. Wilmot Sitwell. Their son John Wilmot Maynard was killed in action in 1915.

Turfing

Turf dance is a form of American street dance that originated in Oakland, California. The term is credited to dancer Jeriel Bey, who created it as an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor because the terms "having fun with it" or "hitting it" (as it was originally known) didn't seem marketable. The term turf dancing originated as a way to describe dances that different 'turfs' from Oakland performed to represent where they were from (the same as 'blocks' or 'sets'). The dance form had its earliest influences in the Oakland Boogaloo movement of the mid-1960s, later developing into a distinctive dance style.
History.
Turf Dancing has its earliest origins in the Oakland Boogaloo movement of California in the 1960s, developing into a separate genre of dance in the 1990s. Along with hyphy music, it came to be seen as distinctively representative of Oakland. The movement rose to prominence in 2002 following Jeriel Bey's establishment of his group, "The Architeckz." Turf Dancing was first displayed on videos from artists such as Baby Bash, Keak Da Sneak, and E-40 by innovative and influential turf dancers (and creators of the turfing Lifestyle) Jeriel Bey. Along Demetrius Zigler, Chare' Johnson, Rawnay, Ronald "Head" Singleton & Yun Shep, and Dav 2.0. Turf dance had been promoted as a means of dispute resolution within the Oakland community, and in 2005 The Architeckz built on this concept of dance battle by engaging krump dancers from Los Angeles in city-level competition. Friendly rivalries with dancers from New York and Memphis have developed as well. The artist E-40 brought international attention to the movement with his 2006 single Tell Me When to Go. In 2012 Alonzo (Turf) Jones 
, AKA Retro, a turf dancer and skateboarder from California's Bay Area competed on NBC's "America's Got Talent" (season 7).
Foundation.
The foundation of turf dance is based on a series of dances with different "turfs" in oakland displayed. Some of these foundation dances are "two step," "brookfield," "auntie," "shaking," "the busta," "cliffhangers," "tsunamis" and "traces". Turf dance also includes "story telling" which is a style based on pantomime "life stories" or "everyday activities". Turfing incorporates other dance style concepts such as tutting, flexing, waving and animation. Turf dance is an improvisational, free-flowing form of dance that is based on the idea of pure cause and effect but focuses on storytelling, the creation of optical illusions, and the display of distinctive personal style. Dance elements include popping, locking, and miming. Gliding is heavily used in turf dance because it enables the creation of optical illusions. "Going dumb," or completely letting one's emotions loose on the dance floor, is also a distinctive part of the tradition.

Vestibular evoked myogenic potential

The vestibular evoked myogenic potential or VsEP is a neurophysiological assessment technique used to determine the function of the otolithic organs (utricle and saccule) of the inner ear. It complements the information provided by caloric testing and other forms of inner ear (vestibular apparatus) testing.
The vestibular system.
The vestibular system helps a person maintain: balance, visual fixation, posture, and lower muscular control. 
There are six receptor organs located in the inner ear: cochlea, utricle, saccule, and the lateral, anterior, and posterior semicircular canals. The cochlea is a sensory organ with the primary purpose to aid in hearing. The utricle and saccule are sensors for detecting angular or linear acceleration, and the three semicircular canals detect head rotation. 
Located within the membranous labyrinthine walls of the vestibular system are approximately 67,000 hair cells in total. This includes ~7,000 hair cells from each of the semicircular canals located within the crista ampullaris, ~30,000 hair cells from the utricle, and ~16,000 hair cells from the saccule. Each hair cell has about 70 stereocilia (short rod-like hair cells) and one kinocilium (long hair cell).
History.
Bickford et al. (1964) and subsequently Townsend and Cody, provided evidence for a short latency response in posterior neck muscles in response to loud clicks that appeared to be mediated by activation of the vestibular apparatus. These authors made the additional important observations that the response was generated from EMG (muscle) activity and that it scaled with the level of tonic activation. Subsequent work led to the suggestion that the saccule was the end organ excited. 
In 1992 Colebatch and Halmagyi reported a patient with a short latency response to loud clicks studied using a modified recording site (the sternocleidomastioid muscles: SCM) and which was abolished by selective vestibular nerve section. Colebatch "et al." (1994) described the basic properties of the response. These were: the response occurred ipsilateral to the ear stimulated, the click threshold was high, the response did not depend upon hearing (cochlear function) per se, it scaled in direct proportion to the level of tonic neck contraction, the response was small (although large compared to many evoked potentials) and required averaging, and only the initial positive-negative response (p13-n23 by latency) was actually vestibular-dependent. It was subsequently shown to be generated by a brief period of inhibition of motor unit discharge.
VsEPA and VSEPL.
VsEP assesses the non-auditory portions of the labyrinth and requires kinematic stimuli (i.e. motion) instead of sound stimuli and bear only a loose relationship to VEMPs. This kinematic stimuli needs to be well characterized, precisely controlled, consistent in amplitude, and consistent in kinematic makeup. An electromechanical shaker is a stimuli generator that is widely available. This shaker provides a transient stimuli, can generate angular or linear acceleration, and can couple to the skull directly (with skull screws) or via a stimulus platform. 
The VsEP is commonly divided into two sections: angular vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPA) and linear vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPL).
VsEPA.
VsEPA stimuli needs to be a brief or transient, high amplitude, angular acceleration pulse. Currently, the most effective stimuli for the best results have not yet been identified or agreed upon by researchers. The major downfall of the VsEPA response is that it also elicits a VsEPL response.
VsEPL.
In contrast to VsEPA, researchers have standardized the VsEPL stimuli but many variants of this standard are being used in research laboratories today. The stimulus needs to be a transient, rapidly changing pulse (i.e. linear jerk stimulus). A rectangular jerk step/pulse is generated by an electromechanical shaker. The main downfall of the VsEPL response is the presence of electrical artifacts due to movement and touching of the wires/electrodes during testing.
Application of VEMPs.
An early application was in the diagnosis of superior canal dehiscence a condition in which there can be clinical symptoms and signs of vestibular activation by loud sounds. Such cases have a pathologically lowered threshold for the sound-evoked VEMP. The test is also of use in demonstrating successful treatment. It has diagnostic applications in Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, otosclerosis as well as central disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis.
Other methods of activating the vestibular apparatus have been developed, including taps to the head, bone vibration and short duration electrical stimulation. It is likely that both air-conducted and bone-conducted stimuli primarily excite irregularly discharging otolith afferents. The two otolith receptors appear to have differing resonances that may also explain their responses.
In addition to the response in the SCM, similar reflexes can be shown for the masseter and for eye muscles (oVEMPs or OVEMPs = ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials).

Udupiddy Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between March 1960 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Udupiddy in Jaffna District, Northern Province. The district was carved out of the western part of Point Pedro Electoral District in March 1960. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Udupiddy electoral district was replaced by the Jaffna multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Udupiddy continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas

Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas was a land grant in present day Los Angeles County, California given to Maria Rita Quinteros Valdez de Villa. Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas (Ranch of the Gathering Waters), is named for the streams that emptied into the area from out of the canyons above it, Cañada de las Aguas Frias (Glen of the Cold Waters, now Coldwater Canyon) and Cañada de los Encinos (Glen of the Green Oaks, now Benedict Canyon).
History.
Maria Rita Valdez was a granddaughter of Luis Quintero one of the original settlers of Los Angeles. Maria was married to Spanish colonial soldier, Vicente Fernando Villa (-1841).
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Maria Rita Valdez at in 1871.
The rancho was sold in 1854 to Benjamin D. Wilson and Major Henry Hancock. Hancock later sold his share to William Workman. In 1868 Edward Preuss, purchased over for the development of a city to be known as the "Town of Santa Maria". Lots were platted of about five acres each, but dry weather came and the land reverted to the sheep.
The land next passed into the hands of Henry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker, owners of the United States Hotel at Main and Market Streets in Los Angeles, and became "one vast field of lima beans", supplying the culinary needs of the owners' Hotel. The bean fields survived until 1900 when the land was sold to Burton E. Green of the Amalgamated Oil Company for oil development. After drilling many unproductive wells, they reorganized as the Rodeo Land and Water Company in 1906.

John Schultz is an American writer of fiction and non-fiction. He is also a teacher of writing, the creator of the Story Workshop method of writing instruction, and an emeritus professor in the Fiction Writing Department at Columbia College, Chicago. He was born on July 28, 1932, in Columbia, Missouri, served as an army medic from 1953 to 1955, and then worked in Chicago as a writer and teacher.
The Story Workshop.
Schultz originated the Story Workshop method of teaching writing in 1965. He practiced the method at Columbia College, teaching many writers and training teachers in the Workshop techniques. The Story Workshop method "focuses on helping you hear your own individual voice and provides a supportive, interactive, and challenging environment for developing your reading, writing, listening, speaking, critical thinking, and imaginative problem-solving capacities." The Story Workshop Institute was founded to bring the method to elementary and secondary classrooms and other forums for writing instruction.
The 1968 Democratic National Convention.
Schultz covered the 1968 Democratic National Convention for the "Evergreen Review" and later wrote "No One Was Killed" (1969), a first-person account of his experiences both in the International Amphitheater where the convention was held and on the streets and in the parks of Chicago where antiwar protesters gathered, rallied, and clashed with police.
He also witnessed the subsequent trial of eight participants for conspiracy and inciting riot (the Chicago Seven), which he wrote about in "Motion Will Be Denied," (1972), later republished as "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial".

South Simcoe Police Service

The South Simcoe Police Service is a municipal police force in Ontario, Canada providing service to the municipalities of Innisfil and Bradford West Gwillimbury. It came into existence on January 1, 1997, through the amalgamation of the Innisfil Police Service and Bradford West Gwillimbury Police Service. The neighbouring Barrie Police Service was part of the initial proposal but did not participate in the amalgamation.
The police force is also responsible for waterway policing on the Holland River and parts of Lake Simcoe.
The South Simcoe Police Service has 74 officers and 43 civilian staff members. The police force also has a complement of auxiliary officers.
The Chief of Police from 1997 to 2011 was Bruce J Davis. On April 16, 2012 Rick Beazley was appointed Chief. He was the former Chief of Police for the Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service.
Municipal councillors for The Town of Innisfil have been critical of the 6.75% budget increase for 2011 - with at least one councillor calling for the municipalities to look at other policing options.
Bradford West Gwillimbury is also looking at other policing options - with counsel voting in favour of asking the Ontario Provincial Police for a proposal to provide policing.
Divisions.
The police service operates out of two divisions. The South Division is based in a new building located at 81 Melbourne Drive in Bradford; it opened in January 2008 and houses most of the administration staff, criminal investigations branch, identification bureau, communications, and uniform patrol. The North Division has been extensively renovated and is located at 2137 Innisfil Beach Road in Innisfil. The Services Traffic and Marine Unit, Victims of Crime (VCARS) and uniform patrol operate out of this building. A community office was located at the Cookstown Outlet Mall at Highways 400 and 89 but closed in early 2013.
Special Function Bureaus.
The police force operates several special function bureaus which include a canine unit, containment team, criminal investigations, identification unit, and a traffic and marine unit.

Snowden on Ice

Snowden on Ice is a musical holiday special aired on CBS in 1997. It was funded by Target Corporation.
Plot.
Kate (Ekaterina Gordeeva) and her daughter, Lizzie (Daria Grinkova), moved to Kate's old hometown where Kate was taught to skate by her Grandpa Alfred. His spirit lives on in Snowden, a snowman, who wears Alfred's old hat and scarf.
Kate knows that Lizzie will not be accepted if she doesn't know how to skate, so she pushes Lizzie onto the ice. Kate's bitter rival, Shana (Josée Chouinard), and her students give Lizzie the cold shoulder and laugh at her when she falls. Lizzie comes off the ice in tears and Kate is reminded of when she fell down in one of her performances while attempting a difficult movement during her first competition for the Albert Trophy. Kate's fall allowed Shana to win the competition and all succeeding competitions except one that Bret (Kurt Browning) won only because Shana had a broken ankle and pneumonia. However, she still came in second place. This discouraged Kate, leading her to vow never to skate again.
One night, while no one is watching, Kate summons up the courage to finally attempt skating once again. As she puts on her skates, Snowden comes to life. As Kate steps onto the ice her costume dramatically changes. Snowden skates with her, and as he does so changes into a cartoon.
During the competition, Kate decides to spontaneously enter as a late entry. As there are no rules to the competition, she is allowed to perform. She wins and is promptly given the trophy by Shana, who has become less hostile. Scootch (Scott Hamilton), the narrator, Zamboni man, and old friend of Albert's, carries Lizzie to Kate.
At the end, Lizzie goes out on the ice in an attempt to skate, encouraged by her mother's earlier performance. She skates with Snowden for a while before he transforms back into Alfred (Kurt Browning), who starts teaching Lizzie how to skate as he had done with Kate. She sees this and smiles.

Dalsland Canal

Dalsland Canal () is a Swedish canal which enables ships to sail between Lake Vänern and central parts of the Dalsland and southwestern Värmland lake districts. The canal runs across the well-known aqueduct at Håverud and is a much visited tourist attraction during the summer months, drawing yachts, motor boats as well as canoeists.
Geography.
The canal system stretches from Köpmannebro on Lake Vänern via the Dalsland lakes of Råvarpen, Laxsjön, Lelång and continues into southwestern Värmland by means of the lakes of Foxen, Töck and finally reaches Lake Östen and its extension named Snäcke Canal. The lakes of Stora Le and both Västra Silen and Östra Silen are also deemed part of the canal system. A boat lift at Strandviken on Stora Le Nössemark enables ships to be loaded onto lorries to Halden in Norway and continue their journey down Idefjord and Svinesund to Skagerak. Stora Le is situated 66 m (217 ft) above Lake Vänern. Thirty-one locks help to span this drop. 17 metres of head space along the route enables sail boats to ply the entire length of the canal, in contrast to many other canals in Sweden. However, it pays to note that only 1.8 m (6 ft) of draught and a maximum length of 22.75 m and width of 4.05 m are allowed. Maximum speed on the canal is set at 2.5 knots.

The canal was dug between 1864 and 1868 by engineer Nils Ericson. Only 12 km (7.5 Mi) out of the 250 km stretch of the canal system had to be dug or dynamited, as Ericson made good use of the numerous lakes which span this area.
Canal use.
The canal is exploited by the Dalslands Kanal AB company, seated in Åmål. The canal dues are SEK50 per lock for small boats up to SEK2500 for the whole canal back and forth (in 2010). Several shipping companies offer short cruises on the canal. The "Dalsland kanotmaraton +" canoeing competition is partly held on lakes forming part of the canal system.

<doc id="21568296" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21568296" title="Personal life of Wilt Chamberlain">
Personal life of Wilt Chamberlain

Star status.
Wilt Chamberlain was the first big earner of basketball: his 1959 $30,000 rookie contract was $5,000 more than the previous best earner, Celtics star guard Bob Cousy. He was basketball's first player to earn more than $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia player, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. In addition, he would often stay out late into the night and wake up at noon, a point that became notorious in the 1965–66 NBA season.
When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the "Ursa Major" in Bel-Air, as a play on his nickname "The Big Dipper". It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. Robert Allen Cherry, journalist and author of the biography "", describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping. Designed according to his preferences, the house was constructed with no right angles, and had an "X-rated" room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed. Chamberlain lived alone, relying on a great deal of automated gadgets, with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company. In addition, Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996. Following his death, in 2000 Chamberlain's estate was valued at $25 million.
Friendships and rivalries.
Although Cherry points out that Chamberlain was an egotist, he added that he had good relationships with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: "The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles.
During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of "copping out" in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been "more physical" with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for "intellectualizing" basketball in a negative way.
More hostile was Chamberlain's relationship to fellow Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ten years his junior. Although Abdul-Jabbar idolized him as a teenager and was once part of his inner circle, the student/mentor bond deteriorated into intense mutual loathing, especially after Chamberlain retired. Chamberlain often criticized Abdul-Jabbar for a perceived lack of scoring, rebounding and defense, although Cherry points out that Abdul-Jabbar is virtually peerless regarding scoring, rebounding and call-ups to the NBA All-Defensive Teams. As an admirer of Malcolm X and a supporter of black nationalist movements and the Nation of Islam, Abdul-Jabbar accused Chamberlain of being a traitor to the black race for his Republican political leanings, support of Richard Nixon, and relationships with white women. When Jabbar broke Chamberlain's all-time scoring record in 1984, matters had improved, but after that, Chamberlain repeatedly called on him to retire and accused him of not playing up to the level of his physical abilities. When Abdul-Jabbar published his autobiography in 1990, he retaliated by writing a paper titled "To Wilt Chumperlane " in which he stated "Now that I am done playing, history will remember me as someone who helped teammates to win, while you will be remembered as a crybaby, a loser, and a quitter." and the relationship remained strained until the end. However, in an interview in 1993, Chamberlain told Bob Costas that if he were to see Abdul-Jabbar today he "wouldn't feel any real animosity towards him," because he felt that Abdul-Jabbar was simply "venting a little anger, and saying something he really doesn't mean."
Politics.
Chamberlain denounced the Black Panthers and other black nationalist movements in the late 1960s, and supported Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. Chamberlain accompanied Nixon to the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Love life and “20,000 women” claim.
Although shy and insecure as a teenager, adult Chamberlain became well-known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour "Sy" Goldberg put it: "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met him when he was 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... he never was bad or rude." Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the show "In Living Color" in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing out that their names are on it, as well as a 1991 "Saturday Night Live" sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. However, "Los Angeles Times" columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was “rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was,” adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table.
According to Rod Roddewig, a contemporary of Wilt's, the 20,000 number was created when he and Chamberlain were staying in Chamberlain's penthouse in Honolulu during the mid-1980s. He and Chamberlain stayed at the penthouse for 10 days, over the course of which he recorded everything on his Daytimer. For every time Chamberlain went to bed with a different girl he put a check in his daytimer. After those 10 days there were 23 checks in the book, which would be rate of 2.3 women per day. He divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence.
In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate at the time of his escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children.
Cherry believes that Chamberlain's extreme sex drive was fueled by the female rejection he had experienced as a teenager, causing him to overcompensate. His lifelong friend and on-and-off girlfriend, Lynda Huey, eleven years his junior, said: "He had an inability of combining friendship and sexuality." Shaw added: "Wilt never liked to admit a weakness ... you cannot be married and be Superman ... you cannot appear invulnerable to your mate."
Death.
Chamberlain had a history of heart trouble. In 1992, he was hospitalized for three days following an irregular heartbeat, and in 1999, his condition deteriorated rapidly. During this time, he lost 50 pounds. After undergoing dental surgery in the week before his death, he was in great pain and seemed unable to recover from the stress. On October 12, 1999, Chamberlain died in Bel-Air, California, at the age of 63. He was cremated. His agent Sy Goldberg stated Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure, and for about a month, doctors had been draining his legs of fluid that had accumulated because of the heart problem. He was outlived by his sisters Barbara Lewis, Margaret Lane, Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain, and brothers Wilbert and Oliver Chamberlain.
NBA players and officials were sad because of the loss of a player they universally remembered as a symbol of the sport. His lifelong on-court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated "the fierceness of our competition bonded us together for eternity", and Celtics coach Red Auerbach praised Chamberlain as vital for the success of the entire NBA. Ex-Lakers teammate Jerry West remembered him as an utterly dominant, yet friendly and humorous player, and fellow Hall-of-Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Johnny Kerr, Phil Jackson and Wes Unseld called Chamberlain one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He was the most happy person they had met.
