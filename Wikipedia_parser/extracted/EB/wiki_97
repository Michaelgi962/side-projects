Ambrosius Hubrecht

Ambrosius Arnold Willem Hubrecht (2 March 1853, Rotterdam – 21 March 1915, Utrecht) was a Dutch zoölogist. 
Hubrecht studied zoology at Utrecht University with Harting and Donders, for periods joining Selenka in Leiden and later Erlangen, and Gegenbauer in Heidelberg. He graduated "magna cum laude" with Harting in 1874 with a study on nermertine worms. In 1875–1882 he worked at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden, and in 1882 became professor at Utrecht. In 1890–1891 he traveled in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, where he made embryological studies, notably on the tarsier. He visited the United States in 1896 and 1907. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by Princeton University, the University of St Andrews, the University of Dublin, the University of Glasgow (LL.D 1901), and the University of Giessen.
Hubrecht´s most important work was in embryology and placentation of the mammals. In papers in the "Quarterly Journal of Microscopial Science" in 1883 and 1887 he put forth the theory—also held by Sir E. Ray Lankester—that the vertebrates originated in a Nemertine form, basing this on his discovery in the Nemertines of a continuous nerve sheath. "The Descent of the Primates" (1897) is the title under which were published his lectures at the sesquicentennial celebration at Princeton. 
Hubrecht founded the Institut Internationale d'Embryologie, today known as the International Society of Developmental Biologists.

John Paul Jones (athlete)

John Paul Jones (October 15, 1890 – January 5, 1970) was an American track athlete who set several world records in the mile, including the first mile record to be ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1913.
Biography.
He was born on October 15, 1890 in Washington, D.C.
Jones entered Cornell University in 1909, majoring in mechanical engineering. He showed little initial promise in track, not making the team until his last year and not impressing until his last race. An extremely popular and handsome man, Jones worked long hours on his studies, played basketball and tennis in the summer and ran as a pastime. As a senior, he was selected for membership in the Quill and Dagger society.
But he worked and trained hard as a runner and had the most successful coach of the era, Jack Moakley. Initially a cross country runner, he won the freshman intercollegiate championships easily and in the fall of his second year won the IC4A cross country championship.
On May 27, 1911, Jones ran in the IC4A championships at the Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium in Allston, Massachusetts in front of 12,000 spectators. Entered in the mile, Boyle of Penn State led at the quarter in 59 followed by his teammate Wilton Paull. Jones hung back in fifth place. Hanavan of Michigan State led at the half-mile mark with a 2:08, with Paull in second and Jones in third. Paull grabbed the lead at 1,000 yards, but Hanavan regained it for a lap. Then, Jones lengthened his stride and passed Paull and Hanavan, winning by 10 yards. His time: 4:15, a new amateur world record, finally surpassing Thomas Conneff's 4:15 set 16 years earlier. However the time was inferior to the professional record of 4:12 set by Walter George in 1886.
Jones was not done for the day. He additionally ran and won the 880 yards to give Cornell the IC4A championship.
He spent the summer playing baseball and tennis, won the IC4A cross country championship again in the fall, then tied for first in the mile with a 4:20 at the 1912 IC4A. He won the 880 in a collegiate record time of 1:53.
1912 Olympics.
He had no desire to compete in the Olympics, but was talked into it and made the ship shortly before it departed for Stockholm.
The 1912 Olympic 1500 metre competition featured the greatest field of mile/1500 m runners ever assembled to that point. Besides Jones, the 1908 Olympic champion Mel Sheppard was entered, as was the speedy Arnold Jackson of Britain, and the promising miler Norman Taber from Providence, Rhode Island. Additionally, American Abel Kiviat, who held the world record in the 1500 m, was in the field. 
Jones was not as prepared as he could have been as he couldn't train on the ship across the Atlantic, so Kiviat, who had set his 1500 m record of 3:55 only on 26 May of that year, barely missing Jones' mile record in the process, was favoured.
In the end, Jackson prevailed in the final, held 10 July, with Kiviat and Taber so close an official camera needed to be consulted to determine who won silver. Jones finished fourth. He also participated in the 800 metres event but he was eliminated in the first round. At the same Olympics he competed in the baseball event which was held as demonstration sport.
Jones, out of the medals, won his third IC4A cross country championship that fall, then ran an indoor mile in 4:19 early in 1913 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Second mile record.
On 31 May, Jones ran again in the IC4A championships in Cambridge, and was up against Olympic 1,500 m silver medalist Taber in the mile.
Taber led at the first three quarters, in 61.6, 2:09.3 and 3:16.1. But Jones launched into his drive as the bell for the final lap sounded and Taber couldn't respond. He crossed the finish line in 4:14, a new world amateur record, and the first mile record to be recognized by the new governing body of track and field, the IAAF, known then as the International Amateur Athletics Federation.
Jones subsequently lost his next race, the 880, and this proved to be his final race. He graduated from college and retired from the sport.
Death.
He died in Tucson, Arizona on January 5, 1970.

<doc id="9916386" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9916386" title="Synaptic gating">
Synaptic gating

Synaptic gating is the ability of neural circuits to gate inputs by either suppressing or facilitating specific synaptic activity. Selective inhibition of certain synapses has been studied thoroughly (see Gate theory of pain), and recent studies have supported the existence of permissively gated synaptic transmission. In general, synaptic gating involves a mechanism of central control over neuronal output. It includes a sort of gatekeeper neuron, which has the ability to influence transmission of information to selected targets independently of the parts of the synapse upon which it exerts its action (see also neuromodulation).
Bistable neurons have the ability to oscillate between a hyperpolarized (down state) and a depolarized (up state) resting membrane potential without firing an action potential. These neurons can thus be referred to as up/down neurons. According to one model, this ability is linked to the presence of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. External stimulation of the NMDA receptors is responsible for moving the neuron from the down state to the up state, while the stimulation of AMPA receptors allows the neuron to reach and surpass the threshold potential. Neurons that have this bistable ability have the potential to be gated because outside gatekeeper neurons can modulate the membrane potential of the gated neuron by selectively shifting them from the up state to the down state. Such mechanisms have been observed in the nucleus accumbens, with gatekeepers originating in the cortex, thalamus and basal ganglia.
Gated synapse model.
The model for gated synapses was originally derived from the model electronic circuit, in which the gatekeeper serves as a transistor in a circuit. In a circuit, a transistor can act as a switch that turns an electrical signal on or off. In addition, a transistor can serve to amplify an existing current in a circuit. In effect, the gatekeeper neuron acts as the transistor of a gated synapse by modulating the transmission of the signal between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. 
In a model gated synapse, the gate is either open or closed by default. The gatekeeper neuron, therefore, serves as an external switch to the gate at the synapse of two other neurons. One of these neurons provides the input signal and the other provides the output signal. It is the role of the gatekeeper neuron to regulate the transmission of the input to the output. When activated, the gatekeeper neuron alters the polarity of the presynaptic axon to either open or close the gate. If this neuron depolarizes the presynaptic axon, it allows the signal to be transmitted. Thus, the gate is open. Hyperpolarization of the presynaptic axon closes the gate. Just like in a transistor, the gatekeeper neuron turns the system on or off; it affects the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron. Whether it is turned on or off is dependent on the nature of the input signal (either excitatory or inhibitory) from the presynaptic neuron.
Inhibition.
Modulation of interneurons.
Gating can occur by shunting inhibition in which inhibitory interneurons change the membrane conductance of an excitatory target axon, thereby diffusing its excitatory signal. A gating signal from the gatekeeper triggers these inhibitory interneurons in order to prevent one set of neurons from firing even when stimulated by another set. In this state, the gate is closed. Examples of this kind of gating have been found in visual cortical neurons and areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in primates that may be responsible for suppressing irrelevant stimuli. Studies suggest that this kind of inhibition can be attributed in part to GABA receptor-mediated synapses.
In order for these inhibitory interneurons to act upon their targets, they must receive input from a gatekeeper signal that stimulates them. This input can be either intrinsic, extrinsic or both. Extrinsic input comes from an area of the brain anatomically and functionally distinct from a given circuit, while intrinsic input is released from parts if the circuit itself. Generally, this input occurs in the form of neuromodulatory substances, such as hormones, neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters that have been released from incoming neurons. These signals then converge on the gatekeeper, where they are integrated and directed toward the target. Depending on the circuit, gate signals may arrive from different brain areas. For example, studies have shown that the entorhinal cortex may gate areas of the medial PFC, thereby inhibiting them from projecting to other brain areas.
Additional research has shown that the thalamus can also act as a source for gating signals. In the pathway between the PFC and the hippocampus, stimulation of mediodorsal thalamic neurons, as well as stimulation of ventral tegmental area neurons inhibited PFC neuron firing. These inhibitory effects were shown to be modulated by various dopamine receptor antagonists, which implies some role of dopamine as a neuromodulatory agent in this circuit.
Role in spatial attention.
Due to the brain's limited capacity to process information, it becomes necessary that the brain have the ability filter out unnecessary information, and select important information. Input, especially to the visual field, competes for selective attention. Models for gating mechanisms in the process of attention have been explored by many groups of researchers, however, a consensus on the role of synaptic gating in attention has not been reached.
Role in working memory.
Gating mechanisms in the basal ganglia have been linked to our ability to filter irrelevant information and access relevant information from working memory. In this instance, the gatekeeping function is the responsibility of the thalamus. It opens the gate between two areas in the cortex, allowing for the influence of stimuli in working memory. The thalamus, however, is tonically inhibited by the basal ganglia. Activation within the basal ganglia will allow for the disinhibition of the thalamus and thus, the opening of the gate.
Permissive gating.
The firing of an action potential, and consequently the release of neurotransmitters, occurs by this gating mechanism. In synaptic gating, in order for an action potential to occur, there must be more than one input to produce a single output in the neuron being gated. The interaction between these sets of neurons creates a biological AND gate. The neuron being gated is bistable and must be brought to the up state before it can fire an action potential. When this bistable neuron is in the up state, the gate is open. A gatekeeper neuron is responsible for stimulating the bistable neuron by shifting it from a down state to an up state and thus, opening the gate. Once the gate is open, an excitatory neuron can cause the bistable neuron to further depolarize and reach threshold causing and action potential to occur. If the gatekeeper does not shift the bistable neuron from down to up, the excitatory neuron will not be able to fire an action potential in the bistable neuron. Both the gatekeeper neuron and excitatory neuron are necessary to fire an action potential in the bistable neuron, but neither is sufficient to do so alone.
An example of this type of gating may occur in the nucleus accumbens. Studies have shown hippocampal neurons may gate the transmission of signals between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Stimulation of the prefrontal cortical neurons has a very small chance of eliciting an action potential in the nucleus accumbens while those neurons are in the down state. Likewise, stimulation of hippocampal neurons fails to produce action potentials in the nucleus accumbens; however, these hippocampal neurons have been shown to switch their targets in the nucleus accumbens to the up state. As long as these neurons remain in the up state, stimulation of prefrontal cortical neurons has a much higher likelihood of producing action potentials in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, the hippocampus serves as the gatekeeper for information flow from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens, such that its action permissively gates these synapses.
Synaptic gating involves a variety of mechanisms by which the efficacy of neuronal activity is modulated. Additional studies demonstrate the permissive properties of synaptic gating. In certain instances, membrane depolarization will cause an opening of the gates that previously had an inhibitory effect on the neuron they were gating. This permissive gating is more than a matter of simple summation, however. Summation is the convergence of many EPSPs at the axon hillock (either from a single neuron firing at a high frequency or from many neurons firing at once) that depolarizes the membrane potential to the point of threshold. The membrane depolarization caused by the opening of synaptic gates causes an additional increase in intracellular calcium that facilitates the release of neurotransmitters; thus, it is able to selectively distribute information from the presynaptic cell.
Synaptic gating and disease.
Comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety.
Studies of children diagnosed with ADHD have shown considerably higher scores on the Anxious/Depressed scale of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, which implies a comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety. It has been suggested that impaired synaptic gating processes in the nucleus accumbens are the underlying cause of this comorbidity. This defect causes a reduction in synaptic gating of dopamine input from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on the nucleus accumbens. One theory supposes that this defect reduces the individual's ability to selectively inhibit fear responses from the amygdala, leading to anxiety. There are several theories, however, on how this impairment ultimately affects those with ADHD.
In studies with rodents, the prefrontal cortex, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the processing of information lasting from milliseconds to several seconds, while the hippocampus has been implicated in the processing of information for longer time scales – such as minutes to hours. Damage to both these areas in people with ADHD seems to illustrate why they exhibit inattentiveness and impulsiveness. Nucleus accumbens neurons are bistable and thus can be selectively gated to either an “up” - depolarized state or a “down” – hyperpolarized state. Nucleus accumbens neurons are gated by hippocampal and amygdala input and this creates a depolarized accumbens neuron that is more receptive to innervation from input from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, in patients with ADHD not only is the input from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens reduced but in addition the gating input from the hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens is also reduced leading to a reduction in activation of the nucleus accumbens neurons. Individuals that take medication such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) will increase their dopamine (DA) output along many of these synapses helping to compensate in the loss of synaptic activity generated from the pathophysiology of ADHD. Taking methylphenidate can increase DA projections to the nucleus accumbens, which can not only act to increase synaptic activity between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (improving memory) but also act as a reward system as the nucleus accumbens is part of the mesolimbic pathway. Moreover, it is possibly why individuals on Ritalin have a “need” and “desire” to learn as it acts as a positive reinforcer in the brain. In addition, this reward circuitry activation is most likely a reason why methylphenidate is highly addictive and carries great dependence. In conclusion, synaptic gating illustrates a plausible mechanism by which ADHD medication like Ritalin modulates synaptic activity and memory.
Schizophrenia.
People who suffer from schizophrenia often exhibit an inability to illustrate context-dependent memory, an inability to show affective valence – proper emotions, and an inability for attentional and temporal processes. Synaptic gating seems to illustrate why all of these inabilities develop. In particular, hippocampal input into the nucleus accumbens, a region of the basal ganglia, acts as a gate creating a more depolarized up state within the accumbens neurons allowing them to be more receptive to innervation from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, amygdala input, in much the same way, acts as a gate creating a more depolarized state within the accumbens neurons although this depolarized state is much more transient. All in all, nucleus accumbens neurons are bistable. People with schizophrenia have damage to the hippocampus and amygdala illustrating improper gating and resulting in nucleus accumbens neurons being in the down position. This is why people with schizophrenia display an inability for context-dependent memory and their inability to show proper affective valence. In addition, because accumbens neurons are in the down position they are not as receptive to PFC stimulation and therefore people with schizophrenia show problems with attentional deficits. The gating theory of schizophrenia posits a bistable nucleus accumbens neuron that when gated improperly leads to a wealth of behavioral and memory deficits.
Current and future research.
Current research now has shed light on the fact that the bistability of a neuron may be part of a larger bistable neural network. Evidence of a bistable network has been shown with the interneurons of the auditory cortex. The stable states of this auditory cortex network are either synchronous or antisynchronous, which illustrates its bistable nature. When auditory interneurons were coupled with electrical and chemical inhibitory synapses, a bimodal firing pattern was observed. This bimodal pattern illustrates the bistability of the network to fire at either a synchronous or antisynchronous state. These two states could be modes by which an individual perceives different frequencies in sound waves. Future research is looking into whether this bistable network embodies many of the properties of a bistable neuron, and if there is a larger gatekeeper modulating the network as a whole. 
It has been shown that nucleus accumbens neurons are capable of being gated because they are bistable. Recent evidence has shown that neurons in the cortex are also bistable, and thus also able to be gated. There appear to be three different types of gating circuits – one that is controlled by the cortex, one that is controlled by the association nuclei in the thalamus, and one that is controlled by circuits spanning the basal ganglia, cortex, and the thalamus. Strong evidence has concluded that gating from thalamus impacts the prefrontal cortex response from the hippocampus. This is seen as either an enhancement or a suppression illustrating the bistability of the process. It has been proven that nucleus accumbens neurons act as a gate yet do the neurons in the cortex act in the same manner? Future research will look at similarities between the two sets of bistable neurons. In addition, the mechanism of shifting the bistable neurons to their “down” state needs to be expanded upon. This state leads to inhibition and thus are their inhibitory interneurons that modulate this shift and if so are inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA involved? Lastly, neurons capable of modulating gates such as hippocampal and thalamic neurons can contact many different areas of the brain. With increasing research saying that neurons in the cortex, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum are all able to be gated, can the hippocampus modulate the signals for all of these and if so can it connect these different brain areas into a much larger neural network capable of being modulated all at once? These are the questions at the heart of synaptic gating in the future.

Château de Pierrefonds

The Château de Pierrefonds () is a castle situated in the "commune" of Pierrefonds in the Oise "département" (Picardy) of France. It is on the southeast edge of the Forest of Compiègne, north east of Paris, between Villers-Cotterêts and Compiègne.
The Château de Pierrefonds includes most of the characteristics of defensive military architecture from the Middle Ages, though it underwent a major restoration in the 19th century.
History.
In the 12th century, a castle was built on this site. Two centuries later, in 1392, King Charles VI turned the County of Valois (of which Pierrefonds was part) into a Duchy and gave it to his brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. From 1393 to his death in 1407, the latter had the castle rebuilt by the court architect, Jean le Noir.
In March 1617, during the early troubled days of Louis XIII's reign, the castle, then the property of François-Annibal d'Estrées (brother of the beauty Gabrielle d'Estrée), who joined the "parti des mécontents" (party of malcontents) led by Henri II, Prince of Condé, was besieged and taken by troops sent by Richelieu, the secretary of state for war. Its demolition was started, but not carried through to the end because of the enormity of the task. The exterior works were razed, the roofs destroyed and holes made in the towers and curtain walls.
The castle remained a ruin for more than two centuries. Napoleon I bought it in 1810 for less than 3,000 francs. During the 19th century, with the rediscovery of the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages, it became a "romantic ruin": in August 1832, Louis-Philippe gave a banquet there on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Louise to Léopold de Saxe-Cobourg Gotha, first king of Belgium. Among other artists, Corot depicted the ruins in several works between 1834 and 1866. The Château de Pierrefonds has been classified as a "monument historique" by the French Ministry of Culture since 1848.
Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (later Napoleon III of France) visited the castle in 1850. As emperor, he asked Viollet-le-Duc in 1857 to undertake its restoration, continuators are Maurice Ouadou and Juste Lisch until 1885. There was no question of a simple repair to the habitable parts (the keep and annexes): the "picturesque" ruins in front were to be kept for decor. In 1861, the project grew in scale: the sovereign wanted to create an imperial residence, so the castle was to be entirely rebuilt. The works, which would cost 5 million francs, of which 4 million were to come from the civil list, were stopped in 1885, six years after the death of Viollet-le-Duc. The departure of Napoléon III had halted the reconstruction and, through lack of money, the decoration of rooms was unfinished. Inside, Viollet-le-Duc produced more a work of invention than restoration (polychrome paintings). He imagined how the castle ought to have been, rather than basing his work on the strict history of the building. On the other hand, with the exterior he showed an excellent knowledge of the military architecture of the 14th century.
Château de Pierrefonds in media.
The castle has often been used as a location for filming including "les Visiteurs", ', ' and the 1998 version of The Man in the Iron Mask. The castle serves as Camelot for the BBC series "Merlin", and a cut scene of this castle was used to portray Wiz Tech Academy in Disney's TV series, "Wizards of Waverly Place".

Topic-based authoring

In technical communication, topic-based authoring is a modular approach to content creation where content is structured around topics that can be mixed and reused in different contexts. It is defined in contrast with "book-oriented" or "narrative" content, written in the linear structure of written books.
This authoring approach is popular in the technical publications and documentation arenas, as it is adequate for technical documentation. Tools supporting this approach typically store content in XML document format in a way that facilitates content reuse, content management, and makes the dynamic assembly of personalized information possible. 
A topic is a discrete piece of content that is about a specific subject, has an identifiable purpose, and can stand alone (does not need to be presented in context for the end-user to make sense of the content). Topics are also reusable. They can, when constructed properly (without reliance on other content for its meaning), be reused in any context anywhere needed.
The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is a standard designed to help authors create topic-based content. The standard is managed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) DITA Technical Committee.

Battling with Buffalo Bill

Battling with Buffalo Bill is a 1931 American Western serial film directed by Ray Taylor and starring Tom Tyler, Lucile Browne, William Desmond, Rex Bell, and Francis Ford. Based on the book "The Great West That Was" by William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody, the film is about a cowboy named Buffalo Bill who goes up against a shady gambler who is attempting to scare off the townspeople so he can gain possession of a gold strike. When a nearby Indian tribe is provoked into attacking the town, the cavalry rides in to the rescue. Cody's book was also used as the inspiration for the studio's highly successful 1930 serial "The Indians Are Coming".
"Battling with Buffalo Bill" was Universal Pictures's 78th serial, the 10th with sound and 4th with full sound, of the studio's total of 137 serials.
Plot.
The plot is a variation on the standard B-Western "Land Grab" plot: Gold has been discovered in the area and gambler Jim Rodney intends to make sole claim to it by pushing the rightful owners off the land and taking it for himself. To do so he has his henchmen kill an Indian woman, provoking attacks from her tribe. This brings Buffalo Bill and the United States Cavalry into the town. Buffalo Bill proceeds to defeat Rodney and his schemes.
Production.
Along with the more successful "The Indians Are Coming" (1930) this serial was based on the book "The Great West That Was" by Buffalo Bill Cody.

Battle of Fundina

The Battle of Fundina took place on 2 August 1876 in Fundina, a village in Kuči, Principality of Montenegro. 
The Montenegrin Army was led by the two Montenegrin dukes, Ilija Plamenac and Marko Miljanov, who had about 5,000 troopers under their direct command. Days before the battle, a Montenegrin Muslim, Mašo-Hadži Ahmetov revealed Ottoman plans to Marko Miljanov, so that Montenegrins knew where the attack was going to come from.
The Ottomans advanced from the Southwest towards Kuči, planning their final attack for 3 August. But, since Montenegrin commanders knew of their plans, they counterattacked a day before. Most of the fighting occurred at the bottom of Heljam hill, where Ottomans were defending from the trenches. While Marko Miljanov was in the front lines, Ilija Plamenac was commanding the Montenegrin army from the back, developing a strategy. After the victory was secured, Montenegrins captured the Ottoman leaders, put them in a house and burned it to the ground. The rest of Montenegrins chased the remaining Ottomans soutward, forcing them into a fast retreat.
The importance of this Montenegrin victory was that it stopped the Turkish advance, and secured Montenegrin victory in the Montenegrin-Turkish War of 1876-1878.

Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation

The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation is a privately funded, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides academic scholarships to children of United States Marines and Navy Corpsmen, with particular attention given to children whose parent was killed or wounded in combat, and those with demonstrated financial need. The Scholarship Foundation is the Nation’s oldest and largest provider of need-based scholarship to military children. Their funding is provided by private supporters, including individuals, corporations, and other nonprofit foundations. The organization's slogan is ""Honoring Marines by Educating Their Children"."
Work.
Since its founding in 1962, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation has provided more than 30,000 scholarships, valued at over $80,000,000. For the 2013-2014 academic year, the Scholarship Foundation announced a record $6,600,000 in scholarships to 2,040 sons and daughters of U.S. Marines and Navy Corpsmen. The scholarships provide opportunities for students that cannot afford the full cost of higher education or vocational/technical training, while increasing their chances for success in their personal and professional lives. Scholarship recipients have Marine and Navy Corpsmen parents that are honorably discharged, active duty, retired, wounded in combat, and killed in action. 
The Scholarship Foundation reports that:
• 89% of their scholarship recipients attend 4-year colleges or universities
• 45% are STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) majors 
• 52% are first-generation college students
• 86% of scholarship recipients that begin school graduate with a degree, compared to the national average of 40%.
In addition, the Scholarship Foundation has been recognized by the Better Business Bureau for satisfying 20 out of 20 standards for charity accountability, transparency, and sound financial management. 
The Scholarship Foundation's awards are primarily need-based. Qualified applicants must be the child of a Marine or Navy Corpsmen, and their maximum family income must not exceed that of the current pay scale of a sergeant major. The average household income of 2013 scholarship recipients was approximately $52,306. 
The Scholarship Foundation cites the mounting toll of the War on Terror, the rising costs of education, and the maturation of a new generation of Marines as an urgent call for increasing support.
Scholarship applications increased by 81% from 2006 to 2013. To meet this increasing demand, and to plan for future generations, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation launched “The American Patriots Campaign” in 2007. The American Patriots Campaign is led by the American Patriots Campaign Leadership Cabinet, composed of former Commandants of the Marine Corps and luminaries from the worlds of business, entertainment, and philanthropy. To date, this drive has raised $65,000,000 in funds, which will allow the Scholarship Foundation to develop a sustainable, diversified base of support to increase their scholarship capacity for the next generation of Marine and Navy Corpsmen families.
Scholarship applications are accepted January-April annual via the Scholarship Foundation’s website.
Origin.
The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation began by helping one child. In New York City in 1962, a group of service-minded Marines, led by Brigadier General Martin F. Rockmore, learned that a Marine World War II Medal of Honor recipient could not afford to send his child to college. Concerned, General Rockmore and his peers organized a charity ball that December, which raised $1,500 (1962 dollars); at the Ball, these funds were awarded as a scholarship to a single student. The annual charity ball, known as the New York Leatherneck Ball, continues to this day, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2012. The original event has inspired numerous balls, galas, golf tournaments, and other fundraisers across the country. Today, the Scholarship Foundation, with the assistance of volunteers across the country, hosts more than 35 fundraising activities annually. 
Special Commitments.
Through its “Heroes Tribute for Children of the Fallen” and “Heroes Tribute for Children of the Wounded” scholarship programs, the Scholarship Foundation has made special commitments to the sons and daughters of Marines and Navy Corpsmen whose parent has been killed or wounded in combat. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 97 students received “Heroes Tribute for Children of the Wounded” Scholarships. 
Leadership.
The Chairman of the Scholarship Foundation’s Board of Directors is Lieutenant General Martin R. Steele USMC (Ret.) Margaret B. Davis has served as the President and CEO of the Scholarship Foundation since 2009. 
Location.
The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation is located in Alexandria, Virginia.

Hamilton Castner

Hamilton Young Castner (11 September 1858 – 11 October 1899) was an American industrial chemist.
Biography.
He was born in Brooklyn, New York and educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, then at the Columbia University School of Mines. He left without a degree and in 1879 joined his brother, E. B. Castner, as a consulting chemist. He left this business around 1884 and worked to devise a process for manufacturing aluminium by reducing aluminium chloride with sodium. Sodium was relatively expensive at that time and Castner devised a process of producing it by the reduction of caustic soda with carbon, a much cheaper process. He failed to interest American industrialists and travelled to England in 1886.
In 1887 his process helped to lead to the formation of the Aluminium Company in England which produced aluminium of high purity. However in 1889 it was rendered obsolete by a much cheaper electrochemical process. Castner's only asset then was his cheap sodium and he worked to develop uses for this, including the manufacture of sodium peroxide, a bleaching agent, and sodium cyanide which was used in the gold mining industry.
In 1890 Castner devised a new method for producing very pure caustic soda by the electrolysis of brine in a rocking cell containing mercury. This process also produced the useful by-products, chlorine and hydrogen. When Castner came to patent his process he found that a similar patent had been lodged by Karl Kellner in Germany and that this had been made over to the Solvay Company in Belgium. In order to avoid litigation, Castner's Aluminium Company combined with the Solvay Company to form the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company and they built a large works in Runcorn, Cheshire. The Castner-Kellner process is still in operation in Runcorn today. 
Castner suffered from tuberculosis and died, unmarried, in 1899 in Saranac Lake, Franklin county, New York state.

Mesa del Sol

Mesa del Sol (Spanish for "mesa (table) of the sun") is a currently under construction mixed-use master planned community in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
History.
Mesa del Sol was approved as part of a public-private partnership strategy with the State of New Mexico, City of Albuquerque and University of New Mexico and has been planning stages since the 1980s. In 2002, the New Mexico State Land Office selected Forest City as the developer of Mesa del Sol in an open bid process and the project broke ground in 2005 with University Boulevard extended to the community. Forest City Enterprises and Covington Capital Partners were the initial developers.
On March 17, 2011, Forest City announced that on March 28 it would break ground on the first phase of its residential development. Forest City plans to build 250 homes and models in the first phase, including infrastructure, and has selected four home builders including Rachel Matthew Homes, RayLee Homes, Paul Allen Homes and Pulte Homes. Builders estimate by early 2012, homes will be available for residents. The homes will range from in size and will cost between $100,000 and $300,000.
Plan.
Mesa del Sol would be built over 40 years and would cover 9,000 acres of the 12,900-acre site. The remaining 3,200 acres is proposed for parks and open space. Overall, the project is expected to house 100,000 people, with a downtown area, 37,500 homes, of office space, for residential and supporting retail, for schools including university branches.
Aperture Center.
Architect and New Mexico native Antoine Predock designed the Aperture Center building which opened in late 2008 as the centerpiece of Mesa del Sol. It is a LEED-certified environmentally friendly building clad in a glass curtain wall inspired by the shape of bone cells. The $11 million town center building has retail shops and restaurants on the ground floor and offices above.

<doc id="9916894" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9916894" title="Battle of Patan">
Battle of Patan

The Battle of Patan was fought on 20 June 1790 between the Maratha Empire and the Rajputs of Jaipur and Jodhpur which resulted in a decisive Maratha victory.
Background.
With the decisive defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat, imperial ambitions of Marathas had suffered a serious setback. But by 1783, with the conquest of Gwalior, Maratha chieftain Mahadji Scindia had managed to reassert Maratha influence over much of Northern India, especially Rajputana. Many Rajput kingdoms like those of Jaipur and Malwa were threatened by the Marathas.
After the failure of Lalsot campaign of July 1787, Marathas of Scindia had evacuated the Jaipur territory. In early 1790, hoping to completely rid the Rajputana off Maratha interference.
The Pursuit.
Intending to prevent the junction of Ismail Beg with his Rajput allies, Mahadji Scindia, dispatched an army under his generals Gopal Rao Bhau and Benoît de Boigne. On the morning of 10 May, Marathas came upon Ismail Beg at Patan.
Stakeholders.
The forces of Rajputs had 12000 Rathore cavalry, 6000 from Jaipur, 5000 Mughals under Ismail Beg, 2000 under Allyghar Beg Khan, 12000 men on foot with 100 Pieces of Artillery, 5000 foot soldiers with Ismail Khan with 21 pieces of artillery, 4000 Rohillas, 5000 Fakirs (religious fighting mendicants) called Attyles and Brakys and Rajput Sybundess (irregular infantry) with 8 cannon and 4000 Meena (hill tribals) soldiers. DeBoignes French army was 10,000 strong with additional Maratha soldiers on the outer flanks.
The battle.
De Boigne's disciplined brigade and artillery guns formed the spearhead of Maratha attack and occupied the central position in the Maratha lines. The Maratha captains Ambaji Ingle and Balaji Ingle commanded the left wing (opposite Ismail Beg) whilst Holkars commanded the right wing. Gopal Bhau commanded the Deccan cavalry which formed the centre. 
The armies faced each other in east-west direction along a straight line. Ismail Beg's contingent formed the southern wing of Rajput-Mughal combine. It was followed by Rathore horsemen and Abdul Mtalab's (Ismail Beg's lieutenant) battalions. Bulk of the Rajput cavalry was concentrated in the centre of wing. The left wing was formed entirely by Jaipur Nagas (fighting monks). The alliance had over 125 artillery pieces at its disposal. They were placed in three rows, one before Ismail Beg, one before Matlab and the remaining one the trenches of Jaipur Nagas. 
Maratha artillery under de Boigne's brigade, though smaller in number, was more rapid, accurate and mobile than the one in possession of their adversaries. Battle of Patan began in the form of sporadic skirmishes and evolved into an all out battle only at its end. The command of Rajput-Mughal army was disunited and had no concrete plan of action. It was this lack of organisation that was instrumental in a decisive Maratha victory as the Marathas had the initiative and the element of surprise on their side.
At the onset of the battle, neither side was in haste to come to grips. The Maratha army took up arms at the daybreak and advanced four miles westwards from their camps to the mouth of the pass leading to Patan. But it took their adversaries over a quarter of a day to take up positions on the hill over overlooking the pass. However hostilities didn't break out for six more hours. It was "ekadashi", an auspicious day in the Hindu calendar. Hindu soldiers on both sides were observing a religious fast. Exchange of fire during this period occurred only between the Muslim soldiers on both sides.
Ambush by the Maratha's.
At dusk, Rajputs and their Muslim allies, retired to their respective camps. The Maratha army however held its positions at the mouth of the pass. The real battle however precipitated in the evening by an unforeseen skirmish. Some Maratha Pindaris from the left wing of Maratha lines, managed to seize animals that were a part of Ismail Beg's contingent. This inevitably led to a small skirmish with Ismail Beg's men. General de Boigne then directed his guns on Ismail Beg's contingent. Caught on unawares, the murderous fire of Maratha guns proved to be deadly. Gopal Bhau and de Boigne, sensing victory, went for the kill. Marathas descended upon enemy camps. Taken aback by the suddenness and the ferocity of the Maratha attack, Rajput resistance capitulated. The Jaipur Nagas held on to their positions before finally being overwhelmed at around 9 pm in the night.
The aftermath.
Pitted against European armed and French trained Marathas, Rajput states capitulated one after the other. Marathas managed to conquer Ajmer and Malwa from Rajputs. Although Jaipur and Jodhpur remained unconquered. Battle of Patan, effectively ended Rajput hopes for independence from external interference. Sir Jadunath Sarkar notes:
From the day of Patan (20th June 1790) to the 2nd of April 1818 when Jaipur entered into protective subsidiary alliance with the British government, lay the gloomiest period in the history of Jaipur kingdom.
His victory increased Scindia's influence with the Peshwas (Maratha Prime Ministers) in Pune, the seat of Maratha government. The Battle of Patan along with the subsequent gains helped Marathas regain lost influence and morale, which had been badly shaken by the Panipat debacle.

Johnny Miljus

John Kenneth (Johnny) Miljus (Serbian Cyrillic Џон Кенет Миљуш or Serbian Latin "Džon Kenet Miljuš") (June 30, 1895 – February 11, 1976) nicknamed Big Serb and Jovo, was Serbian-American baseball player who pitched in Major League Baseball between and . Miljus batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Miljus was born in Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh on June 30, 1895. He served in the United States Army during World War I, in France, as part of the 320th Infantry. His wartime bunkmate was Joe Harris. The two of them would later be reunited as members of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Miljus was wounded in action and was to be sent home. He chose to rejoin his unit after leaving the hospital, instead of heading home.
After toiling in the minors, this lanky 178 pounder spent six seasons in the major leagues as a pitcher. Miljus reached the majors in 1915 with the Pittsburgh Rebels of the outlaw Federal League, spending one year with them before moving to the Brooklyn Robins (NL, 1920–21), Pittsburgh Pirates (NL, 1927–28) and Cleveland Indians (AL, 1929). More than a dependable pitcher, he filled several roles coming out from the bullpen as a closer or a middle reliever, and as an occasional starter as well. Unfortunately, Miljus is probably best remembered as the pitcher who served a ninth-inning wild pitch that escaped Pirates' catcher Johnny Gooch and allowed the New York Yankees to sweep the 1927 World Series. In Game Four, after striking out Lou Gehrig and Bob Meusel, and with two strikes on Tony Lazzeri, the next Miljus' pitch rolled far enough away for Earle Combs to score the winning run.
In a seven-season career, Miljus posted a 29–26 record with 166 strikeouts and a 3.92 ERA in 457⅓ innings pitched, including 45 starts, 15 complete games, two shutouts, and five saves.
Miljus died in Fort Harrison, Montana, at the age of 80.
As of , Miljus has one of the lowest ERA (3.92) of any major league pitcher coming out of University of Pittsburgh with more than 100 innings, behind Bob Malloy (3.26), Doc Medich (3.77) and Steve Swetonic (3.81).

Order of Leopold (Austria)

The Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold was founded by Franz I of Austria on 8 January 1808. The order's statutes stipulated only three grades: Grand Cross, Commander and Knight. During the war, in common with the other Austro-Hungarian decorations Crossed Swords were instituted to reward bravery in the face of the enemy. An Imperial Decree of the 1 February 1901 ordered that in future the senior grade would be split into two separate awards and from then onwards there were four ranks: Grand Cross, First Class, Commander, Knight.
Until the 18 July 1884 the award of the order had also entitled the recipient if he was not already of that standing, to be raised to the following appointments and or ranks of the nobility:
Both the Grand Cross and the First Class Members of the Order wore on formal occasions their orders in the form a Sash with the Order attached to the Bow and respectively an eight pointed and a four pointed breast Star. The Grand Cross was somewhat larger than the First Class as was the width of the Sash. The Commanders' Cross was worn to the neck, suspended from a 52 mm wide ribbon; the Knight wore his Order on a triangular ribbon on the left breast. The actual Order consists of a red enameled gold cross, with white enamel edging. The obverse of the Order displays the initials "FIA" in gold on a red enamel background. The Mottoes of the Order were "INTEGRITATI ET MERITO" and "OPES REGUM CORDA SUBDITORUM". The ribbon of the Order is red with two narrow white side-stripes. The Cross is surmounted by a golden Emperors' Crown. The Grand Cross could also be awarded with diamonds; from 1808 to 1918 only four people received this honour. The last recipient, Ernst Graf von Silva-Tarouca, was awarded the decoration on 11 November 1918, just hours before Charles I of Austria withdrew from public affairs.
After 1918 the Order was no longer awarded.

Anatole Devosge

Anatole Devosge (13 January 1770–8 December 1850) was a French painter.
Born in Dijon, he was the son of painter François Devosge and grandson of sculptor Claude François Devosge. He was one of the many artists trained in the studio of Jacques-Louis David. David's work "Les derniers moments de Michel Lepeletier" survives only in a sketch by Devosge. The sketch formed the basis of Tardieu's engraving, distributed by the government to all 84 departments of France as part of the propaganda campaign following the death of Lepeletier and Jean-Paul Marat.
His own pupils included Sophie Fremiet. Many of Devosge's works are held by the Museum of Fine Arts in Dijon. He was for many years a teacher at the Dijon School of Drawing, and his estate included many works by pupils of the school.
Devosge's work, like that of his master David, was not popular with later audiences. A character in Joris-Karl Huysmans "The Oblate" (1924) comments "Oh, what an absolute ass was this Devosge, what a priceless old woman!".

Askeran clash

The Askeran clash on 22—23 February 1988 in the town of Askeran was one of the starting points of Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which triggered the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The Askeran clash was followed by the Sumgait pogroms.
Background and clash.
On 22 February, two days after the request of Karabakh National Council to transfer the region of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, a crowd of Azerbaijanis surrounded the local Communist Party headquarters, demanding information about rumors of an Azerbaijani having been killed in Stepanakert. They were informed that no such incident had occurred, but refused to believe it. Dissatisfied with what they were told, thousands began marching toward Nagorno-Karabakh, “wreaking destruction en route.” The authorities mobilized roughly a thousand police to stop the riots; the result was a clash in the Askeran region of Nagorno-Karabakh that left two Azerbaijanis dead, 50 Armenian villagers, and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis and police, injured.
On "Azerbaijani Radio", deputy attorney general Katusev reported the fact that "two inhabitants of the Agdam district fell victim to murder", giving two Muslim surnames. These news, according to Tamara Dragadze, were announced to show the gravity of the conflict and to calm down sentiments.
The news of these clashes along with ongoing deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia sparked the Sumgait pogrom against Armenian residents of the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan on 27 February. The violence was led, to some degree, by Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia, perhaps as many as 2000 of them made even more desperate by being forced to take shelter in the appalling conditions of Sumgait's shantytown.

Digital strategy

In the fields of strategic management, marketing strategy and business strategy, digital strategy is the process of specifying an organization's vision, goals, opportunities and initiatives in order to maximize the business benefits of digital initiatives to the organization. These can range from an enterprise focus, which considers the broader opportunities and risks that digital potentially creates (e.g., changes in the publishing industry) and often includes customer intelligence, collaboration, new product/market exploration, sales and service optimization, enterprise technology architectures and processes, innovation and governance; to more marketing and customer-focused efforts such as web sites, mobile, eCommerce, social, site and search engine optimization, and advertising.
Overview.
There are numerous approaches to conducting digital strategy, but at their core, all go through four steps:
Within each of those stages, a number of techniques and analyses may be employed.
Identifying the key opportunities and/or challenges in a business.
Includes one-on-one interviews, group interviews and workshops with a company's senior management, marketing and sales, operations and service stakeholders with a goal of understanding the business strategy, challenges and opportunities, products, organization, processes, supply chain and vendors, distributors, customers, and competitive landscape, as well as the potential role of their online assets.
Includes evaluations of a company's main competitors and potential substitutes with the goal of understanding a company's strengths and weaknesses relative to their competitors and potential substitutes. While this often includes steps found in traditional marketing competitor analysis, such as products, prices, etc. Competitor analysis includes two unique items:
An analysis of a company's financial data (which may include everything from public financial statements to private ERP data) with the goal of understanding the financial impact (positive and negative) that certain changes would have on a company.
ASSIMPLER Blueprinting - The Business Blueprinting of the organization is designed based on the ASSIMPLER framework (based on work of Mandar Vanarse). ASSIMPLER stands for Availability, Scalability, Security, Interoperability, Maintainability, Performance, Low cost of ownership, Extendability and Reliability - applied to business services and processes. The framework helps model the business expectations and challenges to be addressed through the Digital Strategy.
Identifying the unmet needs and goals of the customers.
Includes one-on-one interviews and focus groups with a company's customers with a goal of understanding customers behaviors, needs, goals and perceptions of the company and their industry both in the broadest business context as well as specifically online. In addition to standard marketing strategy methodologies and questions, customer interviews for Digital Strategy may includes usability testing, an analysis of how effective customers are at using the online assets developed by a company for their intended purposes. In digital strategy this is used to uncover usability barriers in the present state that may prevent the accomplishment to the online vision.
An analysis of customer behaviors in their environment, for example: field observations of shoppers at a store. In addition to standard ethnographic research, digital strategy may include video taping of a customer using their computers or specific computer applications or web sites.
An analysis of the usage patters of a company's online assets with the goal of better understanding customer behavior as well as identifying strengths and weakness of the company's current online offerings. This may include understanding how many people are visiting a web site, what are the most popular pages, what are the most popular paths, where are people coming from, where do they drop off, how long do they stay, etc. 
A specific methodology for web analytics where the company's online assets are modeled as a sales funnel, with a visit or impression representing a new leads, a certain page or action in the web site considered a conversion (such as a user hitting the purchase confirmation page) and specific pages in the web site representing specific stages of the sales funnel. The goal of the analysis is to provide insight into the overall conversion rate as well as the key weak points of the funnel (the stages in which the largest percentages of users drop out of the funnel). This may also involve analysis of a company's search engine optimization situation and changes in online traffic pathways.
An analysis of a company's customer databases and information repositories with the goal of segmenting customers into homogeneous groups across one or more dimension of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc. In digital strategy this often includes the online customer registration database which companies use to provide access to their customer specific, protected areas.
An analysis of a customer's behavior (such as their purchase behavior or their service behavior) that looks across all the different channels in which customers interact with a company's products or information. There are lots of different ways to do this, be a representative example would be, a company focuses on the customer purchase process (how a customer becomes aware of a product, how a customer develops the intent to purchase a product, and how a customer actually purchases the product). The analysis would look at which channels (example: phone, catalog, retail store, web site, 3rd party search engine, etc.) a customer uses at which stage of the purchase process, attempts to understand why each channel is used, and evaluates the company's strengths or weaknesses in that particular channel for that particular stage of the process.
An approach to collection customer feedback in a quantitative manner from a large population. In digital strategy, surveys may be used to validate or invalidate key questions raised in more qualitative exercises such as customer interviews and focus group. Depending on the breadth of the survey population and the degree of variation within the population, survey results may be segmented to form homogeneous groups across one or more dimension of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc. Surveys are often conducted online using web intercepts, e-mail lists, or 3rd party panels, although phone surveys or other offline means may sometimes be used when they are questions as to the online savvy-ness of a particular target population.
Developing a vision and prioritizing a set of online initiatives.
A spreadsheet with supporting documentation that quantifies the investments and returns over time that will result from the execution of the online strategy. The Business plan also defines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure and evaluate the success of the online strategy.
A design of a technical architecture which will meet the needs of the business vision and conform to the business plan and roadmap. This is often done as a gap analysis where the current technical architecture is assessed. A future technical architecture, which meets the needs of the online vision, is designed. The gaps between the current state and future state are identified, and a series of initiatives or projects to fill those gaps are developed and sequenced.
Similar to a technical assessment, organizational and process assessments look at the changes that need to be made to an organization and its processes in order to achieve the online vision. They may involve a series of business process reengineering projects focused on the areas of an organization most affected by the online initiatives.
A way of prioritizing various initiatives by comparing their cost of implementation to their expected business benefits. This is often done by creating a two by two matrix where cost of implementation runs along the x-axis (from high cost to low cost) and expected business benefit runs along the y-axis, from low benefit to high benefit. Individual initiatives or projects are then plotted on the matrix in terms of their calculated costs and benefits and priorities are determined according to which projects will provide the greatest benefit for the least amount of cost.
A plan detailing the allocation of media spending across online media (such as search engine marketing, banner advertising, and affiliate marketing) usually as part of the customer acquisition or retention portions of the digital strategy. Since the late 2000s, social media has become increasingly important in engaging with customers both for marketing and customer support purposes, especially benefiting smaller businesses.
Graphics representations or comps of key ideas or processes of the digital strategy. These are often created in order to better communicate a key concept or to build excitement among stakeholders when building consensus or socializing a digital strategy.
A high-level project plan which details the durations and dependencies of all the initiatives in the digital strategy. The roadmap will often include checkpoints to assess the progress and success of the digital strategy.
A description of the key performance indicators used to measure the effectiveness of the digital strategy as well as the process for collecting and sharing the information. The measurement plan usually covers the financial, operational, and e-business metrics and their relationships.
The organizational structure, roles, and process description of the operational entity the will manage the initiatives in a digital strategy. The governance model describes who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, how issues are escalated, and how information on the performance of the projects is communicated within the organization.
Personas.
As of 2007, a trend in digital strategy is the use of personas as a framework for using customer information to prioritize online initiatives. Personas are character sketches which represent a typical member of one customer segment and highlights their needs, goals and behaviors. Because it is representative of a customer segment, it allows decision makers to prioritize various features based on the needs of the segment. Because it is a character sketch, it is sometimes easier for decision makers to internalize the key needs of the segment than it would be by reading reams and reams of data. A typical approach is to create the segment based on customer analysis such as customer interviews, ethnographic research, and statistical surveys. Then assemble key decision makers or stakeholders, present the findings of the personas, and use them to kick start a brainstorming session around different online initiatives which can meet the personas needs and goals.
Execution.
Historically, execution of a business or digital strategy is done as a big bang, with large initiatives such as site redesigns and transactional systems taking 6–12 months to develop and often an additional 6–12 months before they deliver any results. As of 2007, a trend has emerged where companies adopt a more iterative approach to rolling out their strategies, one which leverages a series of smaller tests, which are carefully measured and analyzed and used to modify or optimize the digital strategy. An example of this test-measure-optimize-scale approach is that a company might take some key pages on their site and test a number of versions of those pages with different marketing messages, design approaches, user experience optimizations, navigation optimizations, and even new features and functions using a multivariate or A/B test. The company would then identify the page which had the best combination of changes in terms of some key business metric (such as conversion), analyzing the results to understand which changes were most instrumental in affecting the high conversion rate, and applying those learnings to future pages and future tests (conversion optimization). The advantage of this approach is that in the long run, it tends to be more successful in delivering business results, because each step is measured and adjusted for. In addition, it tends to favor smaller (less risky, less expensive) steps rather than larger (more risky, more expensive) initiatives before getting the payback. The disadvantage is that over time this approach tends to converge on a solution (local optimum), not necessarily the best solution (global optimum) that might have been reached if a company starts from scratch instead of building each step on the previous one. Another disadvantage is that although this solution tends to favor smaller, more incremental changes, there is often a larger up front cost to setting up all the measurement systems and staffing a company with the right analysts and change processes to react to these tests in a timely and effective manner. As a result, companies often adopt a mix of big bang efforts augmented by some smaller, more iterative efforts as part of their overall strategy. A person who is primarily focused on digital strategy may be referred to as a digital architect or digital strategist and a person who executes a digital strategy may be referred to as a digital marketing engineer.
Digital strategy vs. online strategy.
The two terms, "digital strategy" and "online strategy", tend to be thrown out somewhat interchangeably. However, there is some consensus around the differences between digital strategy and online strategy. According to some, digital strategy refers to the strategy a company takes to become a digital company, where digital connotes deeper interactions with their customers, more customized and personalized offerings and interactions, data driven decision making, and organizational models and processes that are more reactive to changes in the company's environment. Online is a subset of digital, as there may be digital assets which are not online. In this context, a company may use the term online strategy to be limited to the development of plans to deploy their online assets to maximize business results and digital strategy to be the more transformative step of changing the organization.

Order of Franz Joseph

The Imperial Austrian Franz Joseph Order was founded by the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on December 2, 1849 on the first anniversary of his accession to the imperial throne. 
Classes.
The order was originally awarded in three classes: "Grand Cross," "Commander's Cross," and "Knight's Cross." In 1869, the class of "Commander with Star" was added, which ranked immediately below the Grand Cross. The "Officer's Cross", which ranked between Commander and Knight, was introduced on February 1, 1901.
The order ceased to exist with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. It was not re-established with the foundation of the Republic of Austria.
Description.
Knights wore the decoration suspended from a triangular ribbon on the left breast. Officers wore it on the left breast without a ribbon. Commanders wore the decoration at the neck, as did Commander with Star, who in addition also wore a breast star. The Grand Cross was worn suspended from the shoulder and also came with a breast star. The ribbon of all classes of the order was plain red. 
In common with the other Austro-Hungarian awards of the period, the Franz Joseph Order was further distinguished with the addition of the War decoration and Swords which could be awarded for military merit. However, if soldiers were honoured, it was usually for distinguished service as opposed to gallantry in the face of the enemy.
Recipients.
Honorees of the order include Anton Bruckner Philipp Sarlay, and Émile Baudot.

Heroes of the West (1932 film)

Heroes of the West (1932) is a Universal movie serial that depicts the dangers and thrills of building a transcontinental railroad.
This was the 82nd serial (and the 14th serial with sound) to be released by Universal.
Plot overview.
John Blaine – helped by his teenaged son and daughter, Noah and Ann – work to build a section of a transcontinental railroad "through the heart of the wild and wooly west." Unfortunately for them but fortunately for film-goers who love Western adventure, their section threads through Wyoming territory, dangerously close to hostile Indians. In addition to tribulations inherent in the Old West, work is hindered by crooked foreman Rance Judd, who is "secretly in the pay of a rival contractor and aims to make Blaine lose his government railroad contract by fouling up construction in any way he can" with help from his henchmen Butch Gore, Bart Eaton, and Buckskin Joe. Blaine is aided by a group of men also working on the railroad: surveyor Tom Crosby, scout Noah Blaine, and rail crew leader Bart Eaton. Together, our heroes must battle skullduggery from Judd's henchmen, stagecoach problems, saloon brawls, horse stampedes, train robberies, Indian attacks, and other perils "to complete the line on time."
As is typical in serial films, each episode ends on a cliff-hanger. For example: after a tremendous fight in an old trapper's cabin, the cabin catches on fire and burns down with our heroes still inside; however, the next episode shows how they escaped the fire through a secret tunnel in the cabin floor.
Cast.
Actress Julie Bishop was already a veteran film actress when "Heroes of the West" was made, despite her young age of 18. Her filmography includes works billed under Jacqueline Wells (beginning in 1914 at age 9), Diane Duval ("Heroes of the West" was her only billing with this name), and Julie Bishop (1941 on). As Jacqueline Wells she appeared in almost 50 B-movies for Universal – spanning the silent era and the talkies – including two comedies with Laurel and Hardy. She adopted the name Julie Bishop when she signed with Warner Bros., and she appeared in more than a dozen feature films including "Sands of Iwo Jima" (1949) with John Wayne.
Production.
Along with "Flaming Frontiers" (1938), this serial was based on "The Tie That Binds" by Peter B. Kyne.
"Heroes of the West" was Universal's 82nd serial. In terms of Universal's serials in the sound era, it was the 14th. See the list of film serials by studio for more information about other serials of the time.
"Heroes of the West" was directed by prolific film director Ray Taylor. With more than 150 films to his credit, Taylor is best known for his serials, for example "Dick Tracy" (1937) for Republic Pictures in the detective's live-action debut, plus almost 50 serials for Universal Pictures including "Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe" (1940) and "Don Winslow of the Navy" (1942).

L'Astrée

"L'Astrée" is a pastoral novel by Honoré d'Urfé, published between 1607 and 1627.
Possibly the single most influential work of 17th century French literature, "L'Astrée" has been called the "novel of novels", partly for its immense length (six parts, forty stories, sixty books in 5399 pages) but also for the success it had throughout Europe: it was translated into a great number of languages and read at every royal court. Even today, this novel is regularly republished, both in full and in abridged edition, and even in comic book form. The first three parts were published in 1607, 1610 and 1619; after Honoré d'Urfé's death in 1625 the fourth was completed by Balthazar Baro, and a fifth and sixth were supplied in 1626 by Pierre Boitel, sieur de Gaubertin. The last two are often counted as one.
The plot is immensely complex, but the main thread of the storyline is the perfect love between a shepherd and shepherdess of fifth-century Forez, the heroine Astrée (named after Astræa) and her lover Céladon (who gave his name to the ceramic). The perfidies and political ambitions of the other characters, which result in many misadventures for the couple, occupy the greater proportion of the novel, which is frequently interrupted by digressions into stories that are strictly unrelated but which serve to flesh out the world in which they live. D'Urfé's descriptions of Forez are sufficiently detailed for many locations to be identified without ambiguity. Visitors to Boën can today follow the "chemins de l'Astrée" ("paths of Astrée") by visiting the "Grand Pré" in the grounds of d'Urfé's old estate.
The most important editions are those of 1733, 1925 and 2006. A film version, "Les Amours d'Astrée et de Céladon", by Éric Rohmer, was made in 2007. An opera by Gérard Pesson was performed in 2006 at the Stuttgart Opera, and in 2009 in Paris.
In his work "The social destiny of man: or, Theory of the four movements", Charles Fourier discussed celadony ("l'amour Céladonique"), describing it as purely spiritual love embodied by Céladon in "L'Astrée".

Norman Greenfield

Charles Norman Greenfield (4 April 1907 – 17 September 1997) was a fireman with the Manchester City Fire Brigade who precipitated a significant legal case in British trade union history, particularly regarding the Fire Brigades Union (FBU).
Until 1938, the Manchester Fire Brigade had been part of the Manchester City Police and its members attested as police constables, a common practice in the early 20th century. In 1938 it became an independent organisation, but firemen who had joined before that time continued to be police constables and answerable to the Chief Constable in disciplinary matters. The Chief Constable also continued officially to be the Director of the Fire Brigade.
The Barnsley-born Greenfield was an experienced First Class Fireman who had been a member of the brigade for some years and was therefore an attested police constable. As such, he was not permitted to join the FBU or any other trade union. However, he took an interest in the welfare of his fellow firemen and particularly of the wartime members of the Auxiliary Fire Service, whose conditions were often extremely poor. He was one of the four members of the board of representatives, the body which had replaced the Police Federation in the fire brigade after 1938. He urged the AFS members to join the FBU, which, not being police officers, they were entitled to do. On 5 November 1940, Greenfield wrote to John Horner, General Secretary of the FBU, informing him of these conditions and enclosing 28 membership application forms from members of the AFS. However, Horner had recently moved and the letter was returned to sender on 9 November. Greenfield had listed his return address as "Fire Station, Manchester 10", his own station, but the letter was returned simply to "The Fire Station, Manchester" and delivered to headquarters.
On 19 November 1940, Greenfield was summoned before John Maxwell, the Chief Constable of Manchester, and charged with three disciplinary offences: acting in a manner likely to bring discredit upon the force; unauthorised communication with a person not connected with the fire brigade; and divulging to that person fire brigade matters. Maxwell listened to his explanation of his conduct, and then dismissed him on the spot. Greenfield appealed, as was his right, to the Watch Committee, the police force's governing body. However, after making his appeal he was asked to leave the room while they deliberated; Maxwell was allowed to stay while the committee deliberated an appeal against his own decision. Unsurprisingly, the appeal was dismissed.
The FBU demanded the return of the letter and membership forms, but Maxwell refused. In response, the FBU took him to court, demanding the return of their property and damages for its wrongful detention. The case, described as "unique in legal history", was heard in Manchester County Court on 26 February 1941 before Judge Thomas Bowes Leigh. Donald McIntyre appeared for the union and D. P. Dingle, Deputy Town Clerk of Manchester, for the Chief Constable. Dingle made much of the fact that Greenfield had headed his letter "Dear Comrade", implying that this showed communist sympathies.
The judge found in favour of the FBU. He ordered that the letter and forms be returned immediately and that the Chief Constable pay £5 damages for their detention. He also awarded costs against the Chief Constable on the highest possible scale.
Greenfield was invited to speak at the annual conference of the FBU in London later that year and was greeted with massive applause. After being dismissed he had obtained a position (and a promotion) as Fourth Officer with Barnsley Borough Fire Brigade. As this was a civilian brigade, he was entitled to join the FBU, and was later elected to the Executive Council.
The Greenfield case strengthened the rights to join a trade union and was one of the final nails in the coffin of the system of police-controlled fire brigades.

Ultzama valley

The Ultzama Valley is an area in the north part of Navarra province, a region in northern Spain that borders France. The area has been called "the Switzerland of Navarre".
Location.
The valley is formed by 13 small villages: Alkoz, Arraiz-Orkin, Auza, Cenoz, Eltxo, Eltzaburu, Gorronz-Olano, Guerendiain, Ilarregui, Iraitzoz, Juarbe, Lizaso and Urrizola-Galain. They all are small villages typical of mountain zones with big old houses and narrow streets. The architecture of the region has been described as "rectangular with gable roofs, plastered walls and ashlars on the corners and lintels, doorways in the centre and balconies across the facades."
Notable areas.
Orgi Forest.
The Orgi Forest is located in the south part of the Ultzama Valley, 25 kilometres from Pamplona. It is a millennial forest of eighty hectares. In the area, it is the only remaining oak woods that used to be common in the valley. A Natural Recreation Zone was created in this forest in 2000.
Other places.
Other things to visit are the churches that most of the village have. This zone has always been highly influed on catholic traditional religion and it can be seen in these churches.
There is an industrial zone in Alkoz where about 1000 people work, most of them local workers.
Gastronomy.
The valley near Aralar is noted for sheep's cheese sold as originating in the Idiazabal area. This area is shared by Navarre and Guipúzcoa. The Ultzama valley also produces sheep's milk cuajada (junket) and, in the autumn, hongo beltza (black mushroom).

Lamin B2 is a protein associated with laminopathies.
Model organisms.
Model organisms have been used in the study of Lamin B2 function. A conditional knockout mouse line, called "Lmnb2tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi" was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program — a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists.
Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice and four significant abnormalities were observed. No homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation, and therefore none survived until weaning. The remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice. Male heterozygotes displayed increased circulating creatinine levels and an increased susceptibility to "Salmonella" infection.

LEM domain-containing protein 3

LEM domain-containing protein 3 (LEMD3), also known as MAN1, is an integral protein in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of the nuclear envelope. It is encoded by the "LEMD3" gene and was first identified after it was isolated from the serum of a patient with a collagen vascular disease.
Structure.
The protein is 82.3 kDa and has a 40 amino acid long LEM domain located at its amino-terminal region. In its carboxyl end it has a RNA recognition motif. The LEM domain is also common to two other integral proteins of the INM: lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) and emerin. 
The LEM segment enables LEMD3 to attach to the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), and therefore, indirectly interact with the chromatin. LEMD3 also has several implications in regulating the cytokine family such as the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and bone morphogenic protein (BMPs). The RRM domain in its carboxylic region attaches to the Smads proteins, the mediators of the cytokine family cellular signalling, and consequently, regulates the downstream genes. 
LEMD3 seems to play an important role in regulating the expression of several fundamental genes. 
LEMD3 and disease.
LEMD3 has been associated with laminopathies as well as osteopoikilosis. Mutations in the "LEMD3" gene have been linked to several genetic diseases such as osteopoikilosis, melorheostosis and Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome.

The Death of Poe

The Death of Poe is a 2006 independent film that tells the tragic story of the mysterious disappearance and death of the American author Edgar Allan Poe. The film is shot mostly in black-and-white with occasional color sequences.
Plot summary.
After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine "The Stylus". Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. 
Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.
An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors.
Afterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner. The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass. The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe. Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered alcohol several times. Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense.
At the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries. He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe. Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die. Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a flashback where he sees his dead wife Virginia Clemm.
Production.
The film was shot on location in Baltimore and Virginia, and at the studios of Redfield Arts [http://www.redfieldarts.com]. Principal photography took place in June and July 2005.
Distribution.
"The Death of Poe" had its world premiere at the Festival of Fantastic Films in Manchester, United Kingdom on September 30, 2006. The U.S. premiere was at Baltimore's Charles Theatre on October 11, 2006.
The film was released on DVD in the United States by Alpha Video on December 5, 2006. Alpha's release also included two rare early films based on Poe's work: "The Avenging Conscience" (1914) (D.W. Griffiths' silent film adaptation of "The Tell-Tale Heart"), "The Raven" (1915), and additional bonus material.
The film was also screened at the Fargo Film Festival in Fargo, North Dakota on March 11, 2007.
Reception.
British film journalist M.J. Simpson described the film as "an impressive and imaginative piece of independent film-making, available at a ridiculously low price and thoroughly worth the time, effort and cash of anyone who has ever enjoyed reading (or watching films based on) the words of Edgar Allan Poe." DVDTOWN.com managing editor James Plath wrote that Redfield's portrayal "really does bring the character to life," however the production "doesn't have the level of acting or script sophistication to make it play in Peoria . . . or anywhere else where Poe isn't revered." This sentiment was echoed by "DVD Pub Review", who stated that "Mark Redfield has a lot of talent, but it seems that he tries too hard to do too much." Both Plath and "DVD Pub Review" lauded the extensive bonus material of the DVD release.

Sustainable South Bronx

Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx) is a non-profit environmental justice solutions organization in New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, founded by Majora Carter in 2001.
The organization spearheaded the creation of Hunts Point Riverside Park, the first piece of the projected South Bronx Greenway. This organization also pioneered a "green roof" project in the South Bronx with its own for-profit installation company SmartRoofs, LLC, and started a "green-collar" job training program called Bronx Environmental Stewardship Program (B.E.S.T.) which prepares urban residents in areas such as ecological restoration,hazardous waste cleanup, green roof installation and maintenance, urban forestry, and landscaping; the program has a 90% placement rate after four years of operation. They are also proposing a Bronx Eco-Industrial Complex as an alternative use for a piece of land where the city government currently is planning to construct a prison, and are engaged in developing "a collection of businesses in which the waste and byproducts of one business are the raw materials for another one."
SSBx runs the Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training (BEST) program, which takes qualifying students through 12 weeks of intensive training covering topics like tree pruning to OSHA brownfield remediation to estuary maintenance to job–life skills. This program aims to give local residents a personal and financial stake in the management of their local environment. In December 2006, Mitsubishi International Corp contributed $150,000.
In 2005, SSBx built the "Cool and Greenroof Demonstration Project" above their offices in the historic American Banknote Building — the first such roof in the City of New York. In 2007, SSBx launched the for-profit SmartRoofs, LLC green roof installation business.

Susa y Epifanio

Epifanio González Villamil is a fictional character (played by Puerto Rican comedian, special education teacher, choreographer and dancer Víctor Alicea), who, along with his on-again, off-again partner, Jesusa Cruz Avilés (played by Puerto Rican singer and comedienne Carmen Nydia Velázquez) have appeared in popular radio and television programs in Puerto Rico for close to twenty years. "Susa y Epifanio" have enjoyed sustained popularity in the island country regardless of the media format and program format their interpreters have had to adopt through the years. They currently appear on the radio program ""Prende El Fogón"" which airs weekdays at noon (AST) on WSKN-AM in San Juan, and on ""El Fogón TV"", aired on weekdays at 5:00 PM (AST) on WORO-TV in Carolina. They also make frequent personal appearances all through Puerto Rico.
Carmen Nydia Velázquez is quick to remind people of the existence of her namesake, Nydia Velázquez, a Puerto Rico-born congresswoman for the Lower East Side section of New York City. The two are not directly related.
Epifanio González Villamil.
Fictional background.
Don Epifanio was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico sometime near 1945, and claims to having been raised in an upper class subsection of town called "La Rambla" (named after La Rambla in Barcelona, Spain, a city after which many of Ponce's features and landmarks have been modeled). In reality, according to their one-time producer, Luisito Vigoreaux, Don Epifanio was born on the coastal sub-section of La Guancha, which is a working-class neighborhood. Since "ponceños" (the inhabitants of Ponce) have a reputation for being very fond of their hometown at best -and have a rather snobbyish attitude about it at their worst, in a way that reminds people of the civic pride of Texans with long-term genealogical ties to the state (Ponce is named after Juan Ponce de León's family) have about it-, Don Epifanio considers Ponce to be heaven on Earth, and is a constant promoter of the phrase: ""Ponce es Ponce y lo demás es parking"" ("Ponce is Ponce, and the rest –of Puerto Rico- is parking). However, he has since reluctantly moved to Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he lives.
Epifanio is a merchant, usually owning kiosks, small eateries or clubs. Due to his age, Epifanio's hair is grey, although reportedly because of a toupée he wears to conceal his baldness. Most often he wears a red guayabera shirt with long sleeves. More character traits are explained later in the article.
Character's origin.
Víctor Alicea has repeatedly stated that he mainly modeled Epifanio González Villamil after his own father, with added characteristics from daily observations of real people. The character was born within ""El Derecho de Lavar"", a comedy spoof on a particular radio (later television) novela, ""El derecho de nacer"", whose basic format has been followed as a formula for almost 70 years in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other Latin American media. The ""Taller de Actores Puertorriqueños"" (Puerto Rican Actors' Workshop), of which Alicea was a member, set up an entire story behind the parody, as to make it resemble the original but exaggerating its main story line as to make it absurd enough to have a comedy made out it.
At the initial stages of the character, Don Epifanio had a laundromat, something that was unbecoming of his avowed origins. His sister was also his partner in the laundry's administrative duties, and constantly had to bring Epifanio to his senses, since his rather caustic sense of humor and constant anger tended to rub the laundry's patrons off. Epifanio had never married and his sister was divorced (she shared a bit of his misanthropy and had a hard time having and keeping a partner). Therefore, when they once found a baby girl inside a trash can in front of their laundromat, they raised her as their "niece". The girl, Chachita, turned to be a pretty, short, shrill-voiced teenager, who befriended Papo Tennis, a tall, unemployed young man who wore basketball garb and constantly went to the Laundromat to clean his tennis shoes using the laundry's equipment. Epifanio hated Papo for many reasons: his tennis shoes would break the equipment up and Epifanio would use this as an excuse, but the real reason was their perceived social class differences. Epifanio, whose skin isn't "fair" by any means, would be openly racist towards Afro-Puerto Rican Papo. He would attempt to sabotage any of Chachita's efforts to go out with Papo, and for this he would put his considerable talent as a miser to good use. Most of these attempts would inevitably backfire (or would somehow hint Chachita of her lineage, something that, according to the story, would have to remain a secret forever given the circumstances of Chachita's adoption), and hence, would make the plot of the story each day, since "El Derecho de Lavar" was a daily 20-minute section within a daily variety show (then aired on WLUZ-TV, San Juan's former Channel 7)
The format proved to be too rigid to sustain over time, so some of the logic behind the novela spoof was relaxed in a newer inception, "Epifanio's Laundromat", which was more centered on Epifanio himself. His attempts to attract clientele and sustain the laundromat would almost always have disastrous results. The owner of WLUZ-TV, Tommy Muñiz, grew tired of the constant struggles he faced to sustain his television channel, and as a result, sold the station to foreign owners, who changed the station's format drastically. As a result, much of the station's talent (including Alicea) were forced to migrate elsewhere. Alicea then joined Luisito Vigoreaux's production company, and for close to twelve years starred in Vigoreaux's best-rated television comedies. One of these paired him with Velázquez, starting a partnership that has remained strong ever since.
"El Viejo Daña'o".
On the character's newer plot lines, Epifanio was still a misanthrope and was less racist than before, but would also turn out to be a geriatric sex addict, who would constantly attend the nearby ""El Pocito Dulce A-Go-Go Girl Bar"", and hence would almost always be broke after spending his money in lap dances or the dancers themselves. Most often than not he would befriend "La Canita", a dumb blonde stereotype character played by Puerto Rican comedienne Waleska Seda, who would live off Epifanio and get him into financial trouble. This penchance for promiscuity earned Epifanio the moniker ""El Viejo Daña'o"" (from "dañado", which literally translates to "The Damaged Old Man"). The epithet "viejo daña'o" has since become a common synonym in Puerto Rico for ""viejo verde"", the Spanish phrase used to depict "dirty ol' men".
Given more physical space to act (since the WLUZ-TV's studios were rather small) Alicea then incorporated physical comedy elements to the character, some of which can be directly attributed to Groucho Marx and Charlie Chaplin, were somehow lost in the translation to Spanish of these comedians' work, and were therefore innovative in Puerto Rican comedy. Epifanio would also throw things on purpose and delibetately missing the target, a technique used by Cuban-born comedic actor Leopoldo Fernandez, Jr., who was very popular in Puerto Rico at the time.
"¡¡Católico y Popularrrrrrr!!".
Epifanio would also acknowledge a stronger affiliation to the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD in Spanish), to the point of becoming an unofficial symbol for the party. The character has acted as comic relief on party rallies and fundraisers, and constantly dresses in red, the party's color. Alicea, who is actually a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, again used his father as a basis for this. He builds upon the traditional loyalty of older members of the PPD to Luis Muñoz Marín, which borders in the near-religious. As a result of these cultural nuances, Epifanio would describe himself as """¡¡Católico y Popularrrrrrr!!""" (Roman Catholic and PPD member), trilling the last "r" for emphasis (as the character often does). When reminded that Roman Catholics aren't supposed to be as sexually "damaged" as he is, he either changes the subject rather obviously (very rarely) or claims that there is no reason for his proclivities to impede on his affiliations.
Already militantly partial to both the PPD and his hometown of Ponce, when the mayor of Ponce, Rafael Cordero Santiago, became a strong leader of the PPD, Epifanio incorporated more references to Ponce and its mayor in his lines. He had to slightly minimize these after Cordero's untimely death from a stroke.
"Popular y soberanista".
After years of ambiguously identifying with the PPD as a movement instead of a political ideology, Epifanio's character sided with the "soberanista" faction, which in the past had included prominent Ponce Mayor, Rafael "Churumba" Cordero. This wing is considered the party's most liberal one, pursuing to promote Puerto Rico beyond territory status by replacing the current territorial clause with a pact based on the sovereignty of both Puerto Rico and the United States, while conserving some current aspects including citizenship, coin and defense. This posture was revealed while he worked as Epifanio in a play titled "¡Coge Cambio!" from 2009 to 2011, and was made official with a "welcome card" issued by prominent "soberanistas" Carmen Yulín Cruz, Luis Vega Ramos and Carlos "Charlie" Hernández. While performing in character, Alicea became more vocal to this belief following February 2010, when an ailing William Miranda Marín, one of the most outspoken "soberanistas" in the history of the PPD, pronounced an speech urging all Puerto Ricans to look beyond personal interests in order to find the convergence needed to push Puerto Rico into the future. From this point onwards, Epifanio's posture remained clear and unchanged, even after the "¡Coge Cambio!" tour had concluded.
Susa Cruz.
In the 1990s, Epifanio was paired with Susa Cruz, setting up a comedic duo that would greatly rely on the acknowledged sexual and political tension between the two. Jesusa Cruz Avilés was born in Las Marías, Puerto Rico. Nicknamed "Susa", she jokingly claims to be a distant relative of Tom Cruise, whose last name is a homophone of "Cruz" (and who has no relation with Puerto Rico at all). She is well known for being the best ""fritolera"" (fritter cook) in Puerto Rico, having a reputation for having invented the "alcapurrias bisexuales" (bisexual alcapurrias), named as such by Epifanio due to their ambiguous shape. As many cooks in rural Puerto Rican eateries do, Susa constantly wears a hair mesh.
Susa is known for being good natured, naive at times, not too-well educated (words with more than three syllables give her trouble), for speaking atrocious English, and yet for being a New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (PNP, in Spanish) supporter (as many pro-statehood Puerto Ricans are). She is single by choice, since her standard in men have to resemble either Cruise or PNP leader Pedro Rosselló, something that is rather difficult to find in Puerto Rico. She is also a good "jíbaro" singer (which gives away on Velázquez's own talents as a singer), and is considerably more street-smart than Epifanio. Her trademark phrase is ""¡Fuera, catarro!"" ("Cold bug, go away!"), usually said as a wish for something unpleasant to go away (and particularly, referring to Epifanio).
Character portrayal.
Mutual relationship.
Susa somehow manages to continue a business relationship with Epifanio, who has always been abusive towards her. At the beginning, he was blatantly racist against Susa (due to her darker skin color), and called her a ""monita"" (monkey). Audience protests and complaints from Afro-Puerto Rican community leaders have only diminished Epifanio's rants, and he blames her troubles on her being ""prieta, bruta y penepé"" (black, dumb and PNP member). Susa almost always counters this by hitting Epifanio with her by-now legendary handbag when insulted, something that inevitably causes Epifanio considerable physical pain.
Later on, Epifanio became an occasional sexual harasser of Susa's, parodying Puerto Rican relatively lax community standards on the practice. Her mild (and sometimes supportive) reaction towards this somehow hinted that she had at least a passing physical attraction towards Epifanio. Epifanio would constantly make passes at her, asking her to join him at ""las latas"" ("the cans", or warehouse space, at the back of his establishments), and pinching her, to the battle cry of ""¡Te picó el juey!"" ("The crab just pinched you!"). She would then either verbally humiliate him in front of other people as retaliation, or would physically assault him to keep him at bay. At times, though, sparks would fly between the two, something which they would deny when asked about it.
Somehow this blatantly antagonistic relationship would be sustained without either deteriorating further (or being consummated sexually, on the other hand) over their mutual programs' seasons. Susa would actually attempt to bring some sense into Epifanio's financial and personal life, with very little success. Epifanio would then claim he needed Susa, at least as a verbal target.
Puerto Rican disc-jockey and television presenter Antonio Sánchez, "El Gangster", would make constant reference to a fabled (some say infamous) motel in Caguas, Puerto Rico, "La Hamaca" ("The Hammock") in his radio and television programs. Some television comedy characters in Puerto Rico would make occasional references to La Hamaca, and as a consequence of this, a vaudeville comedy play, called "Amor en La Hamaca" was written and produced (by Vigoreaux and his partners) to capitalize on the reference. The first installment of the play was successful, and a second run, having little to do with the first play, was written with Susa and Epifanio in mind. This would make good use of Velázquez's singing and Alicea's dancing skills (he was a choreographer for Iris Chacón once). In it, Susa and Epifanio would at last consummate their physical relationship, not without some absurd situations thrown in for comedy. "Amor en La Hamaca II" would become the longest-running play in Puerto Rican history, playing over 4 consecutive years. After their "night at the "latas"", Susa and Epifanio would hint on having had additional nights together, but would tend to be discreet about it (or at least Susa was; Epifanio would give away details to her sheer horror).
While acting as Epifanio, Alicea has become a constant promoter of Puerto Rican artists and acts, covering the full spectre of the Puerto Rican humanities' scene. He now voices his political opinions openly and vehemently, championing animal rights, drama and music classes on Puerto Rican public schools, gay and lesbian rights, better living conditions for the elderly, the HIV positive and children, and other liberal causes. This has somehow rehabilitated Epifanio's image among Puerto Ricans, dismissing his "viejo daña'o" antics in favor of a more tolerant, less grumpy image. He still uses risqué humor to refer to women he physically likes, which he calls ""potrancas"" (young mares), and make the occasional pass to Susa.
Radio and television program runs.
Susa and Epifanio would star in various inceptions of their show on Puerto Rican television: ""Susa y Epifanio", "La Taberna Budweiser", "El Kiosco Budweiser"" and ""Café Teatro El Fogón"", over various Puerto Rican television stations. They would also be featured constantly in Puerto Rican patron saint feasts, honoring the founding of each of the island nation's municipalities. On their live shows they would sing parodies of Puerto Rican song standards ridiculing each other, and would make fun of each other, particularly over that fateful night at "La Hamaca". They have also recorded a Christmas record together.
Velázquez tried her hand at entrepreneurship, and opened a night club in Bayamón, Puerto Rico; she would try to cater to every segment of the local market: from family comedy afternoons on Sundays to male stripper shows on Tuesdays. Susa Cruz would sometimes guest on some of the shows. The night club was forced to close after four months due to licensing restrictions (and some controversy from the club's neighbors). When most Puerto Rican television stations opted to reduce local programming in favor of syndicated shows produced elsewhere, Alicea and Velázquez started a radio program, "Prende El Fogón", on WSKN-AM (later moved to WIAC-AM). On this program they would comment the news (Susa would sometimes sing a décima commenting a particular item), and open the phone lines. Susa and Epifanio would ridicule each other's political views, but more often they would ridicule the Puerto Rican political scene, something they claim would fit right into Gabriel García Márquez's fictional town of Macondo in his book One Hundred Years of Solitude. The program has proven to be an audience favorite. It also opened a community service vehicle for Alicea and Velázquez, and particularly for Alicea. Susa and Epifanio have also taken their ""Fogón"" format into television. On their current television program, "El Fogón TV", they attempt to interview political figures using humor to disarm them. Puerto Rican governor Anibal Acevedo Vilá was their first guest. Susa and Epifanio have also recorded various radio and television advertisements, particularly for products and services catering to the aged (supplementary health plans, audiology services and the like). They also made a cameo appearance in Luis Molina Casanova's film ""El Sueño del Regreso"".

Maryland Route 131

Maryland Route 131 (MD 131) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Seminary Avenue, the state highway runs from MD 25 in Brooklandville east to MD 45 in Lutherville. MD 131 was mostly constructed by 1910, with the remainder completed in the early 1920s.
Route description.
MD 131 begins at a four-way intersection with MD 25 (Falls Road) in Brooklandville. The west leg of the intersection is the entrance to St. Paul's School. MD 131 heads east as a two-lane road through the southern end of the suburban community of Mays Chapel. The state highway crosses over Interstate 83 (I-83) (Harrisburg Expressway) with no access and enters Lutherville, where the road has an at-grade intersection with the Baltimore Light Rail. MD 131 continues through the Lutherville Historic District and intersects Bellona Road before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 45 (York Road). Seminary Avenue continues east as a county highway that intersects MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road) and passes through Hampton before ending at Providence Road.
History.
Seminary Avenue was paved from Brooklandville east to the rail crossing—then part of the Northern Central Railway—by 1910. The remainder of the highway was paved by 1923. Aside from the construction of the I-83 overpass around 1956, there has been very little change to MD 131 since then.

Sheboygan County Christian High School

Sheboygan County Christian High School is a Christian school located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, founded in 1969. It is located on the south side of Sheboygan, a few blocks from Sheboygan South High School.
This school is known for teaching curriculum that focuses on the fact that God is central to all that we believe. SCCHS is a parent-owned school, based on God's Word. The school is known for fundraisers such as cherry pie sales as well as the Good as New Store in Cedar Grove, WI. They have had success in athletics (state titles in soccer and basketball as well as regional championships in volleyball, soccer and basketball), music, drama, and art.
History.
Started in 1969, Sheboygan County Christian High School was founded by parents who wished for secondary education, taught with a Biblical worldview. Its original location was inside of a church, just off of Six Corners, located on the outskirts of Sheboygan. It has grown to its present location at 929 Greenfield Avenue, on the south side of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
Christian High, as a parent run school, is governed by a Board of Trustees, made up of parents who are elected by parents and supporters of the school board. Numerous committees work very hard to keep the school up to date while holding on to its traditions. 
From its small beginnings, SCCHS has grown into a school for the entire Christian community. The school continues to be run on the principles laid out by its founders, providing excellent Christian education to students from more than 35 different churches in Sheboygan, Ozaukee, and Manitowoc counties.
Visual Learning.
Through artistic talents of staff and students, Christian High is unique to have large murals in almost every classroom, relating to the subject taught in each classroom. For example, the English room has "Shakespearian" figures painted on the back wall, while the history room has WW I paratroopers landing in the corner. The Multi-Purpose Room and Media Center also have large murals; two graduating classes commissioned Mr. Ron Van Der Pol, art teacher, to paint different aspects of education at Christian High.
Technology at SCCHS.
Sheboygan County Christian High School is a wi-fi building with two computer labs, one with fully equipped Mac computers, as well as two full lap-top computer carts for classroom and student use.

La Ricerca della Lingua Perfetta nella Cultura Europea

La ricerca della lingua perfetta nella cultura europea (; trans. James Fentress) is a 1993 book by Umberto Eco on a relatively marginal theme in the history of ideas. The writing is essayistic and uses the myth of Babel as a paradigm for connecting the linguistic and social practices. Emphasizing that the quest for a perfect language has never been devoid of ideological motivation, Eco outlines some counterarguments to the idea and suggests that an International Auxiliary Language is a more realistic project. He points that the impossible quest has had some useful side effects (taxonomy, scientific notations etc.) but dwells mostly on exotic proposals. Lengthy passages are devoted to Dante, Lull, Kircher, various 17th century authors and a few less known names from later times. The contemporary project for a politically and culturally unified Europe provides the perspective for a more serious consideration of the theme.

Lil' L.O.V.E.

"Lil L.O.V.E." is a song written by American singer Mariah Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Shante Harris, A. Henderson, S. Howse, James Phillips, and C. Struggs for Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s studio album "Strength & Loyalty" (2007). It was released as the second single from the album in 2007. The song's protagonist, Carey, expresses her need for a 'Lil L.O.V.E' and 'T.I.M.E' from her suspected lover in the chorus. In the United States, "Lil’ L.O.V.E." was released as a digital download on May 8, 2007. The song was officially released as a single in the U.S. on June 5, 2007.
Reviews.
"Lil L.O.V.E." has received very positive reviews from important industrial magazines and websites.
Cinema Blend expresses, "Mariah Carey and Bow Wow (who, remember, axed the preceding "Lil" some time ago) join the cause for "Lil L.O.V.E." Mariah reveals she's still plenty relevant and is not vanishing anytime soon. Bow Wow sounds pleased with himself in the song's background, so good for him."
According to "Billboard", “… “Lil L.O.V.E.," featuring a melodious and round duet with Mariah Carey, is their 2007 version of the 1998 hit "Breakdown" …"
Additionally, SoundBytes - News4Jax praises Carey, calling her the main focus of the song. "The group can also show a softer side without stooping to syrupy-ness. Mariah Carey's sensual crooning is the first voice you hear on "Lil L.O.V.E." and before listeners know it, they're hooked and drawn into the midst of a seductive club jam. Dupri, who specializes in such designer dance floor material, helms the song's dense, layered keyboard noodling and synthetic bass pattern that while completely formulaic, could've been a contender on the R&B charts if Carey was its sole focus. Instead, the song's potential is blocked by the Thugs' and Bow Wow's loquaciousness on the mic."
Music video.
The video was directed by Chris Robinson who last directed Carey in the video for her single "I Know What You Want" with Busta Rhymes.
In the video are guest appearance of Swizz Beatz and Jermaine Dupri.
The video premiered in BET's "106 & Park" on July 5, 2007.

MANIAC III

The Maniac III (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer Model III) was a second-generation electronic computer (i.e., using solid state electronics rather than vacuum tubes), built in 1961 for use at the Institute for Computer Research at the University of Chicago.
It was designed by Nicholas Metropolis and constructed by the staff of the Institute for Computer Research. Its design was changed to eliminate vacuum tubes, and thus it occupied a very small part of a very large and powerfully air-conditioned room. It used 20,000 diodes and 12,000 transistors, and had 16K 48-bit words of core memory. Its floating multiply time was 71 microseconds, and divide was 81 microseconds.
Its most novel feature was unnormalized significance arithmetic floating point. This allowed users to determine the change in precision of results due to the nature of the computation.

The Lost Special (serial)

The Lost Special (1932) is a Universal movie serial based on the story "The Lost Special" by Arthur Conan Doyle. This adaptation does not include Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes, and moves events to the American West.
This was the 84th serial (and the 16th serial with sound) to be released by Universal.
Plot overview.
A special train carrying gold bullion is hijacked on its way from the Golconda Mine. Laying down portable tracks, the bandits take the train off the main line, hide it in an abandoned mine shaft, steal the gold, and pick up their makeshift tracks, leaving a mystery in their wake. Part owner of the mine, Potter Hood, and the railroad president, Horace Moore, search for the mysteriously disappeared train and gold. They are unaware, however, that the criminals are working secretly for Sam Slater, the other partner in the gold mine, who wants to sabotage mine operations enough that he can take over completely. Potter's son, Tom Hood, arrives home from college and determines to solve the mystery with the aid of his pal Bob Collins. They board the gold-shipment special train on its next run. Meanwhile, newspaper reporter Betty Moore – who is niece to the railroad president – and her friend Kate Bland begin their own investigation. After the four youths foil an attempt at a second heist, they join forces. The next 11 chapters show the characters' attempts to locate the "Lost Special" train and identify the ringleader.
As is typical in serial films, each episode ends on a cliff-hanger. For example: the two girls are driving in a car along a road that parallels the speeding train, when a henchman's revolver shatters the windshield of Betty's car, blinding her and sending her car toward the on-rushing train. Other cliff-hanger endings include a runaway car sailing off the cliff into a lake and our heroes being trapped by rising water in a dungeon.
Cast.
One of the leading man, Ernie Nevers, was an American Football star. Another sports star, Reb Russell, was cast in the role of "One of Bob's College Pals."
Production.
The advertising for the serial stated: 
"The Lost Special" was Universal's 84th serial. In terms of Universal's serials in the sound era, it was the 16th.
The series was written by veteran Universal serial writers Basil Dickey, Ella O'Neill, George Morgan, and George Plympton. These scenarists specialized in believable, likable characters and snappy dialogue that enhances the story.

This Man Must Die

This Man Must Die (), American title The Beast Must Die, is a 1969 French and Italian thriller film directed by Claude Chabrol. The story is based on a 1938 novel by Cecil Day-Lewis, writing as Nicholas Blake, "The Beast Must Die". The film had a total of 1,092,910 admissions in France.
Plot.
A high-powered car races through the French countryside. A young woman is in the passenger seat. It enters a small village at speed.
Charles Thénier's nine year old son, returning from the beach, is run over at speed and the driver continues on without stopping.
Charles vows to have his revenge, keeping a note of his thoughts in a journal.
The police investigation is fruitless. Charles thinks the guilty party may run a garage as there is no record of a car going in for repair. Partly following his hunches and partly by chance he discovers that actress Hélène Lanson was the passenger in the car. 
He seduces her under a false name as part of his revenge plan, and discovers that the real killer is her brother-in-law Paul Decourt, a man detestable even to his own family. He contrives for Hélène and himself "to visit the family" in Brittany, to further his plot.
While Charles is left with conflicting thoughts as to whether or not he will kill him, consciously saving him from a cliff-fall, Paul's teenage son, Phillipe, confides in him his own wishes to see his father dead.
Hélène confesses that she once slept with Paul but although Charles presses her for further confessions she does not confess the accident, though she is clearly thinking of it.
Charles decides to kill Paul in a faked boating accident and buys a yacht for the purpose. However Paul pulls a gun on him and reveals that he has read his journal and knows his plot. He has passed the journal to his solicitor to read should something happen to him.
Charles appears to give up and drives off with Hélène. In a roadside cafe the TV announces the death of Paul Decourt in a poisoning, and appeals for Charles to return, which they do.
He announces to the police that it would be foolhardy to kill Paul when he knew the journal would reach them (which it has). But they conclude this to be a double bluff and arrest him. However, Paul's son enters and confesses.
Back at their hotel, Charles is weary and promises to tell Hélène the entire story the next day. He leaves a confession on the pillow stating that the son's misplaced fatherly love for Charles had caused him to confess but Charles could not let this happen, it was he who killed Paul. He must sail off never to be seen again. His confession probably lets the son off and reopens the issue but it remains ambiguous as to which of the two did the act.

San Nicolas (Pamplona burg)

San Nicolás (Saint Nicolas in English) is one of the three burgs that were joined in 1423 to form the modern city of Pamplona (Iruña in Basque). The others were "Navarrería" (Navarrian-town)and "San Cernin".
Situation.
San Nicolás limits to the north with the Navarrería burg, in the south by "Paseo Sarasate" (Sarasate Boulevard), in the east is "Plaza del Castillo" (Castle Square) and in the west by "Parque de la Taconera" (Taconera Park).
History.
San Nicolás was founded in the 12th century by a group of weavers and turners. The new burg was initially called "Tencerías" (from the old Spanish word "Tencero", Weaver). In 1366, when the first census of the city was accomplished, there were 29 families living there. But the population grew quickly and in 1427 there were 64 families living there.
In 1423 there were some streets that had the same name but were in different burgs. There were two or three Main Street, Carpenters' street, Butchers' street, Shoemakers' street and some more. The reason is that in these times it was very usual to call the street by the name of the shops and business that were there. San Nicolás had the oldest streets because Navarrería and San Cernin had had a war and they had destroyed buildings, streets and churches. So, the king Charles III of Navarre decided to change the names of the streets in Navarrería and San Cernin.
Pablo de Sarasate, a famous violinist, was born in San Nicolás Street, where a tributary plaque in his honour can be found.

Lympia

Lympia or Lymbia () is a large village in the Nicosia District of Cyprus. In 2011 the population was 2,694.
The name derives from the original name of the settlement "Olympia". 
History.
The road leading from Mosfiloti to Lympia, a stone-made bridge was constructed in 1944 over the Tremithos river. 1300 metres north of the bridge, towards the Lympia village, there is a small chapel dedicated to Saint Marina. Next to it there was a shepherds' settlement. When the Ottoman Turkish army arrived in these areas from Lefkara, during 1570, it attacked the settlement with cannons, which the Turks were trying out for the first time. They started firing against the houses with stone shells and the settlement was destroyed along with the church. The inhabitants that survived took refuge in Lympia village. The day that "Agia Marina" was destroyed was a Tuesday and ever since then the region was named "Kakotriti" (Bad Tuesday). 
The church of Saint Marina was rebuilt, while signs of caves can still be found in the area of the settlement.
2007 Recycling Plant Conflicts.
In 2007, citizens of the village reacted to government plans to built a Recycling Plant (referred to as 'Chita - XYTA') in a neighbourhood called 'Coshi'. There have been conflicts with police special forces culminating in extreme protest events in the area. During that time, children were taken out of the local school during teaching time and along with their parents and locals entered the Nicosia-Larnaca motorway, in both directions, during morning peak time. Due to the closure of the motorway, there was traffic congestion in the area, with difficulties to those travelling to Larnaca airport. During the motorway take over, locals were throwing flaming cars from up the airlift bridge to the motorway grounds. 200 Lymbiani were called to the Cypriot court for actions related to the events. In order to defuse the situation and get traffic in Cyprus back to normal, the President of the House of Representatives Dimitris Christofias (which is today the President of Cyprus) started negotiations for moving the Plant.

Additional components.
Aside from the immediate functional uses, the site educates the public on how to "reduce" their energy usage and "rethink" the way they consume electronics products. In order to "reduce" the amount of electricity consumer's products consume, it advises that consumers look for the Energy Star logo on the products that they buy. A comprehensive list of advice and recommendations are available in the "Reduce" section of the site. 
Thus, it encourages consumers to "rethink" ways in which they can make smarter, environmentally friendlier choices when purchasing electronics products.
Varying perspectives on electronics recycling.
There are some entities in the United States and abroad that raise serious concerns about electronics recycling. Some groups are concerned that the workers who do the actual recycling are exposed to toxins that can be harmful to their health. MyGreenElectronics represents a consumer-driven voluntary approach to recycling. Some people believe that the government should do more to compel consumers to pay for an advance fee for the future recycling cost of their product. Others believe that manufacturers of electronics should take full responsibility for the recycling or disposal of their products.

Campaign to the North of Baoding

Campaign to the North of Baoding (保北战役) consisted of several battles fought between the nationalists and the communists in the region to the north of Baoding during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era and resulted in communist victory.
Prelude.
By the mid of June 1947, the nationalists had given up the attempt to reinforce Northeast China by sending nationalist 43rd Division of the 94th Army. Instead, the nationalist 43rd Division was deployed to the south of Tianjin along with other nationalist units, including the nationalist 16th Army, the nationalist Reorganized 62nd Division, the nationalist 142nd Division of the 92nd Army. In the region north of Baoding, the nationalists had six divisions and two regiments, including the Independent 95th Brigade, the 2nd Security Division and the 3rd Security Division stationed at Baoding. For the region along the railway from Gaobei Hotel (Gao Bei Dian, 高碑店) to Xushui (徐水) and the regions of Yi (易) county and Laishui (涞水), they were garrisoned by the nationalist 5th Division and 121st Division of the nationalist 94th Army, the 7th Security Division, and a regiment of the109th Division of the nationalist 16th Army. The communists decided to launch an offensive against the nationalists in the region north of Baoding in accordance with the communist Summer Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China.
Order of battle.

Communist order of battle:
Campaign.
On June 25, 1947, the communist 2nd Column attacked the town of Xushui (徐水), and the bulk of the communist force of the 3rd Column attacked the town of Solid City (Gu Cheng, 固城) and Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, 北河店), while the bulk of the communist force of the 4th Column attacked the region of the Source of the Cao River (Cao He Tou, 漕河头) and the region of Xu River Bridge (Xu He Qiao, 徐河桥). Meanwhile, detachments from the communist 3rd and 4th Columns were deployed to stop the nationalist reinforcement. By the evening of June 26, 1947, the communist 2nd Column succeeded in taking Xushui (徐水) and completed annihilated the local garrison consisted of a regiment of the 109th Division of the nationalist 16th Army. In addition, nationalist strongholds along the railway from Xushui (徐水) to Tian’s Village Shop (Tian Cun Pu, 田村铺) had fallen into the enemy hands. On June 27, 1947, the communist 4th Column succeeded in taking regions included Twenty-Mile Shop (Er Shi Li Pu, 二十里铺), Source of the Cao River (Cao He Tou, 漕河头), Xu River Bridge (Xu He Qiao, 徐河桥), and Sun’s Village (Sun Zhuang, 孙庄), badly mauling local garrison consisted of the nationalist 2nd and 3rd Security Divisions in the process. The communist success forced the nationalists to sent out reinforcement: the nationalist 16th Army and the 43rd Division of nationalist 94th Army reached south of Liang Township (Liang Xiang, 良乡) via Beijing – Hankou railroad, and the 5th Division and the 121st Division of the nationalist 94th Army reached the region of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, 北河店), from Dingxing (定兴). Little did the nationalists know that the enemy was waiting to ambush them.
On June 28, 1947, a portion of the 6th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column and the 7th and 8th Brigades of the communist 3rd Column stopped the nationalist reinforcement at Shiwuji (十五汲), the region south of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, 北河店), while the bulk of the 6th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column attempted to outflank the nationalist reinforcement from behind. After being ambushed from the flank, the nationalists immediately withdrew to the north of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, 北河店), thus successfully avoided besiegement, but in doing so, the nationalists they attempted to reinforce were doomed. As a result, by the evening of June 28, 1947, the communist 3rd Column took Solid City (Gu Cheng, 固城), the local garrison of the town consisted of a regiment of the 121st Division of the nationalist 94th Army was completely annihilated. In addition, in a stretch from the region of Tian’s Village Shop (Tian Cun Pu, 田村铺) to the region of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, 北河店), all of the nationalist strongholds along the railway had fallen into the enemy hands. In order to lure out the nationalists in Baoding for an ambush, from July 4, 1947 thru July 6, 1947, the communist 4th Column took regions included Horse Factory (Ma Chang, 马厂), Xie’s Village (Xie Zhuang, 谢庄), Northern and Southern Strange Villages (Nan – Bei Qi Cun, 南北奇村) west of Baoding, and annihilated the 1,000 strong nationalist reinforcement consisted of security regiments from Full City (Man Cheng, 满城), and Completed County (Wan Xian, 完县). The nationalists in Baoding refused to be lured out and the campaign thus concluded with communist victory.
Outcome.
The nationalists suffered more than 8,200 losses in their defeat and the critical communication / transportation line of Beijing – Hankou railroad was cut by the enemy as a result.

Mikayil Mushfig

Mikayil Mushfig (, born Mikayil Ismayilzadeh) (5 June 1908, Baku – 12 March 1939, Baku) was an Azerbaijani poet of the 1930s.
Most of his poetry is about romance, nature, feelings, working class, and communism. Despite this, he soon became one of the slandered and criticized poets in the Union of Azerbaijani Writers. Soon afterwards, Mushfig was arrested and executed by Soviet authorities at the age of 30 during the Stalinist purges in the USSR. In 1956, he was exonerated posthumously. Nikita Khrushchev era of de-stalinization has resulted in Mushfig's poetry being famous in Azerbaijani society.
Life and poetry.
Mikayil Mushfig was born in the city of Baku of Baku Governorate in 1908. He received his elementary education at Russian-language School in Baku. After the establishment of the Soviet regime in Azerbaijan in 1920, he studied at Baku Teacher's School and in 1931, he graduated from the Department of Language and Literature of the Baku State University.
Mikayil started his professional career as a school teacher. While being involved in teaching he started writing poems. His first poem "Bir Gün" ("The Day") was published in the "Ganj fahla" newspaper in Baku in 1926. At about this time, he adopted the pen name Mushfig (Perso-Arabic for "tender-hearted"). Along with Samad Vurgun and Rasul Rza, Mikayil Mushfig became one of the founders of new Azerbaijani Soviet poetic style in 1930s. He translated a number of poems from Russian as well.
In his poetry, Mushfig glorified the work of industrial workers and peasants and lauded the construction of industrial enterprises in Baku and other cities. According to Mushfig's wife, Dilbar Akhundzadeh, Mikayil welcomed the transition from the Perso-Arabic script to the Latin script that took place in Azerbaijan in 1927. His excitement was expressed in the following verse:
Despite being a pro-communist poet, he was against the Baku Academy of Music not teaching tar lessons anymore. Mushfig wrote a poem, titled "Sing Tar, Sing", to show his protest against the decision in the late 1920s.
Arrest and execution.
In late 1930s, as been confessed by writer Mehdi Huseyn in one of the Ilyas Afandiyev's memories, it was very common among poets and writers to slander each other and accuse each other of nationalism or spreading religious propaganda. The reasons of such slanders were generally connected with the personal problems. Mushfig also came under the barrage of criticism in the Azerbaijani Writers' Union along with some other literary figures of the era such as Huseyn Javid or Ahmed Javad by some of the literary figures who were serving the interests of Stalin's regime in the USSR branded Mushfig as "chauvinist" and a "petit-bourgeois poet". He was arrested in 1937, charged with treason as "the enemy of the state", and executed in 1939 in the Bayil prison near Baku. He was later officially exonerated. Even though, Mushfig wrote poems about Joseph Stalin, during in de-stalinization policy of USSR he was portrayed as "anti-stalinist" poet.

Yepes

Yepes is a "villa" (town) in the northern region of the province of Toledo, in the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain.
Geography.
Situated on the westernmost part of the comarca called "La Mesa de Ocaña" (the plateau of Ocaña), its limits are:
History.
Yepes has the first documented human presence in a Celtiberian village, founded ca. 600 BC.
The former "Hippo" or "Hippona" of the Carpetanians, where the Celtiberians defeated the Roman troops of Quintius and Calpurnius, derives its current from the times of the Muslim rule, when it was called "Hepes", which in turn would produce "Hiepes", "Iepes" and finally "Yepes". It is possible that "Hepes" be a mozarabic toponym.
During the reign of Alfonso VII, "Yepes and its castle" are ceded to the "Concello" (Council) of San Nicolás.
Monuments.
Plaza Mayor (Main Square).
The plan was originally triangular, with the Church and the Archiepiscopal Palace at the sides, and an administrative building at the base. During the 16th century it served as a place for spectacles. Besides, testimonies of the time reveal that there was a good "mesón" at it.
Later, in the 18th century, the Archiepiscopal Palace was modified in order to create 19 homes for people living in caves and a slaughter house, thus giving the square its current rectangular shape.
Colegiata de San Benito Abad.
This church, dedicated to abbot Saint Benito, was designed by Alonso de Covarrubias, master of the Toledo Cathedral. It is a splendid building of white stone, dating from late and beginnings of the Renaissance. It consists of three naves, plus two series of side chapels and a 70-metre tower.

Millico was born at Terlizzi, near Bari. In 1754, he came to Naples. In 1757 in Rome, he had his first performance as a singer. From 1758 to 1765, he worked in Russia, and then returned to Italy. In 1769, Gluck adapted the role of Orpheus in his "Orfeo ed Euridice" for Millico to perform at Parma — the original role, composed for the alto castrato Gaetano Guadagni, was transposed up for Millico's soprano voice and the whole opera turned into an act of the celebratory work "Le feste d'Apollo". In 1770, Millico sang, in the Vienna revival of "Alceste", the originally tenor role of Admetus, which Gluck had specially rewritten for him, and created the role of Paris in the same composer's "Paride ed Elena", the last in the trilogy of his Italian reform operas. "Gluck and Millico became firm friends, and Gluck entrusted the musical education of his beloved niece to Millico's care—no small tribute to the singer's musicianship".
After interpreting the role of Rinaldo in Antonio Sacchini's "Armida", which was given at Milan's "Teatro Regio Ducale" during the 1772 Carnival season, Millico decided to partner the composer in his moving to London, in order to serve as the ""primo musico"" (principal castrato) at the King's Theatre. Here he performed the leading male roles in the first London operas by Sacchini ("Il Cid" and "Tamerlano", both in 1773). He was also involved in a failed attempt to counteract "the progressive watering-down, pasticcio-fashion," of Gluck’s "Orfeo" which had been initiated in London in 1770 with the active participation of Guadagni. Taking advantage of the availability at the King’s Theatre of both Parma main performers, Millico and Antonia Maria Girelli Aguilar, an original Gluck version of "Orfeo and Euridice" in one act was billed in summer 1773, but it turned into a complete fiasco being dropped after only two performances. On his way back homeward in 1774, Millico called on Gluck in Paris and, as the French version of "Orfeo ed Euridice" was in laborious rehearsal, the composer would give two private test performances "at the house of the Abbé Morellet in which the tenor role of the French score was sung by Millico (with Gluck's niece Marianne taking both Eurydice and Cupid, and with Gluck at the harpsichord)".
After performing at Venice, Florence, Rome and Milan, Millico returned to Naples in 1780, where he became highly popular as a composer and teacher. He taught singing to the Bourbon princesses Maria Teresa and Luisa Maria, and to Emma Hamilton, not yet the lover of Lord Nelson. During this time at Naples, he composed eight operas that are confirmed as being his work, nearly all of which premiered in Naples — two to libretti by Metastasio and one to words by Ranieri de' Calzabigi, Gluck's librettist for all three of his Italian reform operas. The published score of Millico's opera "La pietà d’amore" includes a message of support for Gluck's attempted reforms of "opera seria". Millico also composed eight cantatas, a "Salve regina", 23 arias and 22 duets unattached to a dramatic work, and 82 canzonets. These works are usually composed for harp accompaniment and were extremely popular at the time; many of them were published, both individually and as a part of collections. A collection of his keyboard compositions, "Musical Trifles: a Collection of Sonatine", was published in 1791 in London. He remained at Naples, where he died.

Asset quality

Asset quality is an evaluation of asset to measure the credit risk associated with it.
Description.
Asset quality is related to the left-hand side of the bank balance sheet. Bank managers are concerned with the quality of their loans since that provides earnings for the bank. Loan quality and asset quality are two terms with basically the same meaning.
Government bonds and T-bills are considered as good quality loans whereas junk bonds, corporate credits to low credit score firms etc. are bad quality loans. A bad quality loan has a higher probability of becoming a non-performing loan with no return.

<doc id="9917505" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9917505" title="Vanilla planifolia">
Vanilla planifolia

Vanilla planifolia is a species of vanilla orchid. It is native to Mexico, and is one of the primary sources for vanilla flavouring, due to its high vanillin content. Common names are Flat-leaved Vanilla, Tahitian Vanilla (for the Pacific stock formerly thought to be a distinct species), and West Indian Vanilla (also used for the Pompona Vanilla, "V. pompona"). Often, it is simply referred to as "the vanilla". It was first scientifically named in 1808.
Distribution.
"Vanilla planifolia" is found in Central America and the West Indies. It prefers hot, wet, tropical climates. It is harvested mostly in Mexico and Madagascar.
Description.
Like all members of the genus "Vanilla", "V. planifolia" is a vine. It uses its fleshy roots to support itself as it grows.
Flowers.
Flowers are greenish-yellow, with a diameter of 5 cm (2 in). They last only a day, and must be pollinated manually, during the morning, if fruit is desired. The plants are self-fertile, and pollination simply requires a transfer of the pollen from the anther to the stigma. If pollination does not occur, the flower is dropped the next day. In the wild, there is less than 1% chance that the flowers will be pollinated, so in order to receive a steady flow of fruit, the flowers must be hand-pollinated when grown on farms.
Fruit.
Fruit is produced only on mature plants, which are generally over 3 m (10 ft) long. The fruits are 15-23 cm (6-9 in) long pods (often incorrectly called beans). They mature after about five months, at which point they are harvested and cured. Curing ferments and dries the pods while minimizing the loss of essential oils. Vanilla extract is obtained from this portion of the plant.
Chemistry.
The major chemical components from the pods are vanillin, vanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Kurt Voss

Kurt Voss (born Kurt Christopher Peter Wössner; September 15, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter and musician/songwriter. Voss has written and directed a dozen feature films, including Will Smith's debut "Where The Day Takes You", the Sundance sleeper "Horseplayer", actress Jaime Pressly's debut feature "" and numerous rock and roll related films including "Down and Out with the Dolls" and "Ghost on The Highway: A Portrait of Jeffrey Lee Pierce and The Gun Club."
Voss has frequently collaborated with fellow UCLA alumnus Allison Anders. Working together over twenty-five years, the duo created an acclaimed trilogy of rock films: "Border Radio (1987), a portrait of the L.A. punk scene featuring such stalwarts as John Doe ("X") and Dave Alvin ("The Blasters") and published by the prestigious Criterion Collection; the Sundance-premiered "Sugar Town" (1999), featuring John Taylor ("Duran Duran") and Rosanna Arquette; and "Strutter" (2012), a Kickstarter-financed indie featuring fresh faces, with luminous black and white cinematography by Voss himself.
Anders and Voss also co-wrote "Things Behind The Sun" (2001), which was awarded a Peabody Award in 2002.
In addition to his film work, Voss is a founding member of the West Coast punk band The Hindi Guns, an outfit which produced three highly regarded albums. The First, "The Hindi Guns" (2004,
French Fan Club Records) inspired Rolling Stone Magazine's Senior Editor David Fricke to write, "I've already found one of my favorite new bands of the year: a rough, bewitching four-piece from Portland" and "'I Don't Want To Drink Mercury" is your best ticket into these ten tracks: a bluesy crawl set in dub-like darkness, like early Hole produced by Lee Perry." Early vinyl pressings of the album found their way into the hands of the late and legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ, John Peel, who put no less than three of the album tracks into rotation on his BBC program. 
The album was supported by a 30 city U.S. tour, the West Coast portion of which was filmed for a short film which can be found on Youtube. The Hindi Guns second album, the cheekily named "Rarities" (2009), was a collection of EP material, B-sides and studio outtakes. The album was reviewed in Record Collector by British punk critic Kris Needs, who gave the record four stars,
noting, "Anyone who dedicates a song to 'Instant Karma and The Peel Sessions' must have their heart in the right place.
The late DJ was a fan and it's not hard to see why... 
After the departure of original singer Dee Dee Cheriel, the founding members of Hindi Guns made a final farewell album,
ironically entitled "Do Or Die" (French Fan Club Records, 2009). The CD featured a photo of a sword-wielding Yukio Mishima; the back cover of the record depicted a photo of the author's severed head. The album received extensive college radio play, and an honorable mention in the annual roundup of "Year's Best" by ex-Times pop writer Kevin Bronson But by then the group was disbanded. Voss went on to spent the next twenty-four months involved in the production of the rock film "Strutter' (2012).
Personal life.
Kurt Voss was married to British actress Sammi Davis, with whom he made the film "Horseplayer", from 1990 to 1993.
Voss married actress Sara Ashley in May 2012. The two met while on set of a film in which she acted, and Voss co- directed.

LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)

LittleBigPlanet, commonly abbreviated LBP, is a puzzle-platformer video game, based on user-generated content, for the PlayStation 3 first announced on 7 March 2007, by Phil Harrison at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, California. It was developed under the title "The Next Big Thing" by Media Molecule and was published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Many saw the game as an important title for Sony's PlayStation 3.
The game received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from critics and has been praised for its presentation, including its graphics, physics, and audio, along with its gameplay and large array of customisable costumes and online features. Additional praise was given to its scope and future potential based on user-created content; minor criticism was reserved for specific elements of the gameplay mechanics and level creation facilities. "LittleBigPlanet" has won a considerable number of awards. A PSP version of the game was released in November 2009, featuring new levels and content. The game was offered by Sony as a free download as part of their 'Welcome Back' program, following the PlayStation Network outage of 2011.
Overview.
The game revolves around the player's control of a small character, known as a "Sackboy" or "Sackgirl" — or gender-neutral "Sackperson" — owing to their appearance, in a variety of platforming scenarios. Though the game features a set of pre-built levels for the player to explore, the game's customisable nature is equally important, from altering the player's character and personal space, to building entirely new objects and levels, and then sharing and playing them online with other players as part of the "LittleBigPlanet" community.
Main features.
Sackboy can run and jump and grab certain objects. Grabbable objects can have the designation of being purely for mobility, such as swinging, or they can be pushed, pulled, switched, or operate in other manners. The player uses these abilities in several ways: to play and explore the environments that come with the game, which feature platforming elements such as jumping, pushing, grabbing and running, and which make use of the game's robust physics engine; to create their own content, such as simply placing stickers into levels, in addition to using the level editor to create, destroy, edit and manipulate levels; and, finally, to share creations, by publishing items such as levels and objects with the online community, and play these creations online with others. These three modes are described simply by the title's tagline: "Play. Create. Share."
The player begins the game with an introductory level, and then go inside their own "pod", a personal space from which they can access the three modes of gameplay, and decorate the room with stickers and decorations. Initially, only the Play mode is available and the player must complete some tutorials, narrated by Stephen Fry; once the basics are mastered, the player is free to play the rest of the game.
Core gameplay.
The "Play" section of "LittleBigPlanet" consists of a number of levels that have been created by Media Molecule, and are based around different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations, such as Japanese gardens, dry Mexican deserts, New York City streets, icy Russian stages, and other places. By completing the levels available to them (by reaching the scoreboard), the player may then advance the story and play further unlocked levels. The story mode comprises eight themed areas, with each area containing three or four main levels, and some of these levels in turn contain collectable keys to unlock bonus mini-levels. The main story mode comprises more than 50 pre-built levels in total.
To control their Sackboy character, the player moves by using the analogue sticks, jump with varying degrees of height depending on the pressure applied to the action button, and grab onto objects to either move or swing on them. In addition to regular left-and-right movement, and despite the 2D look of the game, levels consist of three levels of depth—the foreground, middleground and background—and may be traversed between either automatically by the game itself, or by the player's command. The player can opt to emote their Sackboy by applying varying degrees of delight, fear, sadness, and rage, control each arm independently through the analogue sticks, slap other players by jerking the arm movement with the analogue sticks, and use the Sixaxis motion-sensing functionality to animate the character's head and body.
The player can access the Popit menu at any time during the game by pressing the square button.
A large variety of pre-built objects are present in levels which may be interacted with. Those, along with objects that have been constructed out of simple shapes can be given specific materials, which act in a manner physically similar to those they represent. Examples include soft sponge, gripping rubber, and tough wood. Objects that are built with mechanical components, such as motors, pistons, jets, wires and springs also act appropriately. Along with these objects, levels contain dangers that the player must avoid. Examples include objects or platforms that have been set on fire, and explosives that can damage the player's Sackboy if he strays too close. Explosives can also be used to blow up sections of the level. The player's Sackboy can also be crushed to death if trapped under or between heavy items and drown in water. As the player progresses through the level, he encounters checkpoints - points from which the player can resume upon death.
Each level contains a number of "score bubbles", initially known as "sponge" in early demonstrations of the game, which may be collected in order to increase the player's score to beat their own, and other players', high scores. Users may collect larger bubbles known as "prize bubbles" which contain collectable items. Many of these bubbles are hidden or are in hard-to-reach places, and contain items such as new stickers and decorations, or new materials and objects that may be used in the "Create" mode for the user's own levels. Certain stickers, when placed properly, trigger events. Special clothing and accessories for the player's Sackboy is obtained by completing a level without losing a life, also known as acing a level. In addition to the prize bubbles, collectable keys found in main levels unlock new mini-levels with unique goals, such as skipping a spinning pole or bouncing to grab bubbles. There are also unlockable time trial levels such as bobsleigh racing.
Throughout the story mode, players collect prize bubbles which unlock materials, objects, stickers, decorations, sound effects and music tracks which can be used in Create mode.
Content creation.
The player may customise their character in a range of ways. They are able to select a base colour and texture for their "Sackboy" from a range of materials and designs along with giving them pre-made items including clothes, masks, swords and capes. By placing stickers and decorations on their Sackboy, it is possible to make new kinds of costumes. The game also features items based on other PlayStation franchises, such as a Helghast soldier from "Killzone 2"; and character models based on Kratos, Medusa, and the Minotaur from the "God of War" series; Nariko from "Heavenly Sword"; Old Snake, Raiden, Meryl, and Screaming Mantis from ""; Sephiroth from "Final Fantasy VII"; a Chimera from the "Resistance" series; as well as Ryu, Guile, Chun Li, and Zangief from "Street Fighter"; characters from the "Sonic the Hedgehog" franchise; and Ezio from "Assassin's Creed II".
Although the "Create" aspect does include minor tweaks to existing levels whilst they are being played, such as placing stickers and decorations in levels, the main focus of this mode is the level editor. The editor incorporates a large number of editing facilities to create levels from a low to a high degree of complexity. The player may create new objects by starting with a number of basic shapes, such as circles, stars and squares, and then "painting" a shape into the level using one of the many materials. Objects may be glued to each other or to the level. More mechanical features are also available, such as connecting objects together with string, using bolts to spin objects, or using various kinds of triggers. Rocket motors can be attached to objects to propel them across a level. After creating custom objects, the player may save their creation to a library for later use, and even share their object by placing it inside a prize bubble in their level, so that other players who play the level can collect it and may use it in their own levels.
In order to facilitate the creation process and to accommodate any mistakes made, the editor features a manipulatable time system, whereby the player may "rewind" the editor, which acts as an undo feature, or pause the editor, which temporarily halts objects that run under the physics engine, such as gravity acting on falling or rolling objects. In addition to his narration for other parts of the game, Stephen Fry provides the voice-over for the large number of video and interactive tutorials that accompany the create mode, a number of which must be completed in full before unlocking a new set of objects for use. User-generated content is not limited to the player's region, but is available worldwide.
Although the feature was initially announced with the game, the ability to use create mode with other players online was not included in the final release. This functionality was added to the game through a software patch in November 2009 following a public closed beta test. Users are able to invite up to three people from their PlayStation Network Friends list to join them and create levels together.
Online community features.
A large part of "LittleBigPlanet" is the global community features through the PlayStation Network for the player to interact and share their "patches"—levels and other modifications—as well as online play. As of September 2011, more than 5 million user-created levels have been published. The main focus of the "Share" component is the ability for level creators to publish their levels and objects to the online community for other people to play. Once a custom level has been played through, the player is able to tag the level with a list of predefined words, and may cycle through the word choice to find the most appropriate. This allows other players to quickly find their level of choice. The player can search by a specific tag such as "Beautiful". The player has a "heart" feature available to them, which allows them to specify which levels, stickers and decorations they prefer; in this way, people can heart to show appreciation for other people's creations, and visit their online friend's hearted items, or visit the creator of a hearted item, then view his or her hearted items, and so on.
An official community website called the "LittleBigWorkshop" complements the in-game sharing features. Logging on with their PlayStation Network IDs, users are able to create blueprints for level designs, view in-depth tutorials and take part in challenges. It is additionally the home of the official forums. Among its other features, the website allows users to upload in-game videos and photos.
"LittleBigPlanet" features a range of multiplayer options. Levels can be played online with up to four players, locally with up to four players or with a mixture of up to four online and local players. Up to four local users can play together in "Create" mode, whilst the ability to create levels with up to four players online has been added in an update. The way in which users undertake the level is dependent on the design of the level and how the users choose to play, allowing the players to choose whether they play cooperatively or battle against each other to get to the finish line first, or collect the most bubbles.
In the weeks following the game's release, some users reported on community forums that levels they had created had been taken down for "moderation", and were no longer available to play. A representative from Sony stated that once a level is flagged by players using the in-game "Good Grief" system, levels were reviewed by a moderator and only removed if deemed inappropriate. On 11 November 2008, SCE confirmed that around 200 levels —less than 0.5 percent of levels published — had been removed, the majority of which contained obscenity, while the rest were removed due to copyright violations. Media Molecule acknowledged there were issues with the moderation system and released an update in December to help rectify them. In addition to an on-screen message, users are notified with a PSN message when a level they have published is removed, along with information on the reason for its removal. They are able to play and edit the level themselves whether on or offline. The developers have clarified the rules regarding what is and is not appropriate and have made several changes "behind the scenes" which they hope will "alleviate most of the issues that creators have experienced."
Web-based portal and API.
In May 2009, Alex Evans revealed that a new community website was in development that will serve as a web-based portal to help users promote their levels. Shortly before the release of "LittleBigPlanet 2" a new community website was launched with the aim of enabling users to find and share in-game creations more easily. "LBP.me" allows players to search and browse community-made levels from both "LittleBigPlanet" and "LittleBigPlanet 2". Every level is allocated a unique URL which users can copy and share with other people. When signed into the website with their Sony Entertainment Network account, users may add levels to their 'Queue' enabling them to find the level quickly when they're in the game and connected to the game's servers.
Website owners may use a selection of widgets to add live data from the game to any website. A public API is also available but access to it is provided by the game's developers on a case-by-case basis.
Interface.
The game's main interface is based around the player's "pod" and three planets, each of which is focused on the three areas of the game; "Play", "Create" and "Share". These are accessed using the "pod computer". The main Play planet is the "LittleBigPlanet". This is where users access the main story levels and also serves as the main gateway to user-created levels. The LittleBigPlanet features an interface into the PlayStation Store where users can access and purchase downloadable content. The Create planet, called "My Moon", is where players save and access levels they have created or copied. Each crater on the moon holds one or more levels. The Share planet, or "Info Moon", is where players can access their friends list, gameplay statistics and their hearted levels and creators. The user can select a person on their friends list to view their published levels, hearted levels and hearted creators.
The "Popit" is a menu which provides access to costumes, decorations, stickers, materials, editing tools, and messaging features. It is contextual and displays certain sets of options, depending on whether the user is playing a level, editing a level, or in their pod. Stickers and decorations can be plastered onto any surface in the game world, and can be used to decorate something, or to activate certain switches. Stickers may be created by the player, either using an in-game camera (allowing them to take pictures of in-game scenarios), or they can use the PlayStation Eye. However, the ability to import images from the player's console hard drive has not yet been implemented, and is not planned.
Plot.
"LittleBigPlanet" is set in a world full of creations made by Creator Curators. One of the Curators, a rogue Creator called "the Collector", is stealing the other Creators' creations and not sharing them with the world (sharing is one of the core elements of "LittleBigPlanet"). Play starts at the "Gardens" level, where the player meets the King, one of the Curators; the Queen; Little Xim; Big Xam and their servant Dumpty. The player is taught the basic gameplay at this stage: running, jumping, and swinging. The next setting is the "Savannah", where the player accidentally breaks one of the ruler's creations. In return for forgiveness the player must investigate what's scaring the ruler's buffalo. Further adventures involve finding Meerkat Mum's son and a Bridegroom (a story arc with a Day of the Dead theme). After the wedding play moves to the "Canyons", where the player must rescue Uncle Jalapeño and defeat the evil Sheriff Zapata. After completing this the player is taken to the "Metropolis" and turned into a car for a car race scenario. The next adventure takes place on the "Islands", where the player is trained in martial arts and must defeat evil Sumo. From there the player goes to the "Temples", to get a talking flame-throwing cat, and the "Dancer's Court", to speak to The Goddess. Finally the player gets the chance to defeat the Collector in his "Bunker". After the final battle the Collector is revealed to be a little, lonely man who kidnapped everyone because he did not have any friends. Everyone, including the player, offers to be his friend and he accepts, ending his being evil.
Development.
"LittleBigPlanet"'s origin lies in a conversation between Media Molecule co-founders Mark Healey and Dave Smith after a cinema visit to see "Howl's Moving Castle". Healey and Smith discussed a game that had character controls similar to their previous game, "Rag Doll Kung Fu", that would be playable on a console. Healey and Smith left Lionhead Studios in December 2005 along with other Media Molecule co-founders Alex Evans and art director Kareem Ettouney, and managed to arrange a meeting with Phil Harrison, the then-head of development for SCE Worldwide Studios. They created a prototype of their idea, a game called "Craftworld", a physics-based, 2D side-scrolling game, with a place holder character called Mr. Yellowhead. Mr. Yellowhead's arms were controllable with the right analogue stick of the PlayStation 2 controller that Media Molecule had connected to their PC, whilst his legs were controlled with the left stick. The object of the game was to guide Mr. Yellowhead past a number of obstacles by grabbing onto objects and pushing or rolling them around.
They chose to pitch their idea to Harrison using their own software, rather than PowerPoint, which allowed for bullet point information as in standard presentations, but also for live, controllable movement of game characters. By their own admission, the pitch was vague and they had deliberately toned down the creative aspect of the game—which they felt may have appeared as "weird" for a console game—for fear of negative reception of their pitch by Sony. They presented the prototype purely as a playable game, and only briefly mentioned the user created content aspect; Evans relates that Harrison actually picked up on the creative side, and had asked them why they had chosen not to explore this element further. The meeting, which had been scheduled to last 45 minutes, eventually lasted 3 hours at the end of which, Sony agreed to fund the project for six months. After some further development, the team were asked to present what they had done to Sony in what Healey describes as a "Dragons' Den style scenario". Following this, Sony gave them a deal to develop "LittleBigPlanet" for the PlayStation 3 in exchange for exclusivity and ownership of the intellectual property. Media Molecule became incorporated as a company in February 2006.
Despite backing from Sony, Media Molecule were unsure about exactly what direction they were going to take the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule were aware of the fact that Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.
The game was less than one year into development, when it was first shown at GDC 2007. Evans remarked that this public approach to the game's development meant they had been able to react to feedback from the community, and the game had been specifically designed to allow them to easily implement further developments in the future, based on demand from players.
In the game players can earn an in-game costume of Mr. Yellowhead by completing the last level in the Story Mode without losing a life.
Marketing.
Both Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule undertook a large-scale marketing campaign in the run-up to the game's release. In North America, SCEA partnered with several major online retailers to offer unique bonus gifts to customers pre-ordering the game from the selected retailers. These gifts include codes to access additional in-game costumes, a sticker book, a burlap pouch and an official game guide. In the UK, SCEE partnered with online retailers to offer downloadable costumes, such as the Nariko character from "Heavenly Sword", to customers who pre-order the game. A temporary shop in the UK was set up in Manchester city centre, where people were able to play the game before its release. The shop moved to central London in October. In addition to a chance to play the game, it offered such activities as t-shirt making. To market the game to an online audience, a website campaign to "reclaim Pluto as the ninth planet", "Proposition Pluto", was released as a marketing tool several weeks before the game's release.
On 17 December 2009, "LittleBigPlanet" content including virtual clothing and furniture was released for PlayStation Home. Users are also now able to meet players and launch into an online "LittleBigPlanet" game from within PlayStation Home with advanced options. On 13 May 2010, a "LittleBigPlanet" Game Space was released in PlayStation Home called the "LittleBigPlanet PlayGround". It features a mini-game called the King’s Snap Happy Photo Challenge where users find the target, snap a shot, and unlock Home rewards. There's also a sub-space called "The Creator" where users can create their own wallpapers for their PS3's XMB and coming soon is the LittleBigPlanetDerby which will be a carnival style mini-game. In addition to the Game Space, a personal space was released that users can purchase called the "LittleBigPlanet Pod Penthouse" which is designed after the Pod in "LittleBigPlanet".
Release/Re-release.
A demo version of the game was planned for release on the PlayStation Network in the fourth quarter of 2007, but was delayed until 2008. The demo was again delayed until 11 September 2009, when it was released alongside the Game of The Year Edition. Original announcements pointed to a full release early in 2008, but Sony later said the game had been delayed until September 2008 in the UK. During the Sony PlayStation Day on 6 May 2008 in London, Sony announced the game would be delayed for one month, but also confirmed release dates for 21 October 2008 in North America, 22 October in Europe, 24 October in the UK and Ireland, and 30 October in Japan.
Originally intended for a release in mid-to-late October, a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack delayed the game's release worldwide. It was released in North America and Japan at the end of October 2008, and in Europe at the beginning of November 2008.
On 17 October 2008, SCEE instigated a worldwide recall of "LittleBigPlanet" and announced the game's release be pushed back after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licenced songs in the game included passages from the Qur'an and could therefore be offensive to Muslims. However, no actual complaints regarding the music were made. The song, entitled "Tapha Niang", was by Malian artist Toumani Diabaté, himself a devout Muslim. The game was patched twice, the day before its release for players who had received the game early, before its intended release date. The first update did not affect the song, and was released to patch online issues, modify jetpack controls, and add further costumes, whilst the second updated the game to remove the vocals from the track, leaving only an instrumental. Some American Muslims responded to the recall and stated that they were offended by the restriction of freedom of speech. M. Zuhdi Jasser M.D., head of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, was quoted as saying, "Muslims cannot benefit from freedom of expression and religion and then turn around and ask that anytime their sensibilities are offended that the freedom of others be restricted."
SCEA announced new versions of the game that would be shipped to North American retailers the week commencing 27 October 2008. On 20 October 2008 an SCEE press release stated "LittleBigPlanet" would start to appear in stores in the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, Australia and New Zealand no later than the week commencing 3 November 2008 on a country-by-country basis. Later the same day SCEE confirmed the UK release date as 5 November.
Beta phases.
A public beta version of the game was previously scheduled for the summer of 2008, but it was later announced that only private beta testing would take place; a public demo was mentioned as a "possibility". However, in a later interview, Alex Evans, Co-Founder of Media Molecule, said a beta would be released in September 2008 describing it as "a public beta, but limited at the same time". The first beta became playable on 23 September 2008, when gaming website Eurogamer began offering beta codes to its members on the same date, with a total of 5,800 codes available; the website quickly buckled under the influx of visitors, with many unable to load the site. Subsequently, several other gaming websites including 1UP.com and GameSpot offered beta codes to their users. Players were able to play the beta until it ended on 12 October. Although Sony had originally planned to erase all levels created by players during the beta period, an official poll was held to let the players decide their fate; the players voted to keep the levels. These levels were carried over to the final game, although save game data and progress made in the beta was not.
Future developments and downloadable content.
A feature the title lacks, but was included in demonstrations, is the ability to create stickers by importing images from the console's hard drive. When initially asked about the missing feature, Alex Evans replied that its removal was due to time constraints, and that a patch before Christmas would enable the feature. A later forum post from a PlayStation official countered this by stating image import would not be appearing "for a variety of reasons". Further speculation arose when Media Molecule posted an image to their Flickr page after both statements were made, showing the image import tool in action, and a television advert for the game demonstrated family photographs in a custom level.
It was originally intended that players would be able to use the content creation mode with other players online however this feature was dropped before the game's release. "Online Create" was added to the game via software update 1.21 .
In a demonstration at the 2009 Tokyo Games Show, footage of LittleBigPlanet being played with PlayStation Move was shown. This led to many people to believe that a PlayStation Move DLC pack would be released, allowing the creation of Move levels. It was later revealed that the footage was from a spin-off game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves, and a Move pack was later released for the sequel, LittleBigPlanet 2.
Major updates and downloadable content packs.
On 23 December 2008, weapons were introduced into the game with the release of a "Metal Gear"-themed game pack titled ""Metal Gear Solid" Level Pack". A paintball gun power-up, called the "Paintinator", can be used to activate "Paintinator Switches", can destroy certain enemies, and can be picked up similarly to a jet-pack (which is by simply touching it). The player can also add the Paintinator to custom levels. The game pack includes new "Metal Gear Solid"-themed stickers, music that can be placed in user-created levels, and various character costumes.
In April 2009, Media Molecule released a free software update dubbed "Cornish Yarg", the first major update for the game. New features that were introduced with this update include the ability for the user to play their own music from the PlayStation 3's hard drive whilst in their Pod or in "Create" mode, the ability to turn a prize collection in user-created levels on or off and improvements to the character customisation process. Changes were also made to some creation tools including the ability to hide mechanical objects such as bolts and pistons. Shortly after this update, "Creator Pack 1" was released as a downloadable content pack for free. This pack added new "Create" mode tools including a new type of checkpoint which provides the player with an infinite number of lives for a given section, a tether-less version of the jet-pack (allowing the player to hover around more freely) and a power-up removal marker which forces the player to drop any power-ups such as the Paintinator or jet-pack. The update also included a tool to allow the creator to trigger changes in the entire level's lighting and other environmental settings, when the player passes a certain point or performs an action.
In addition to characters from other franchises appearing in "LittleBigPlanet", Sackboy has also appeared in other video games. In March 2009, an add-on was released for "Everybody's Golf 5" which made Sackboy available as a playable character. Sackboy is also in "", a game released on the PlayStation Network based on the 2005 PC game, "Rag Doll Kung Fu" by "LittleBigPlanet" creator, Mark Healy. Sackboy has also appeared in "ModNation Racers" and "3D Dot Game Heroes".
A "Game Of The Year Edition" was released only in North America on 9 September 2009. The Game of the Year Edition includes many downloadable content packs, along with new levels made by various "LittleBigPlanet" community members. (See the Game of the Year Edition section.)
In August 2009, Media Molecule announced that a future update would add water to the game. Eventually, it was revealed that the water would be released as part of a "Pirates of the Caribbean"-themed downloadable content pack that arrived on 22 December 2009. Much like the "Metal Gear Solid" pack, the premium downloadable content pack contains six new levels and also unlocks new Creator tools allowing users to use the new mechanics in their levels. It allows the user to add water to their levels, and these tools include a Global Water Object allowing users to trigger changes in the water properties of their levels as well as a water-activated switch, a scuba-gear pick-up and a bubble machine. The pack also features "Pirates of the Caribbean"-themed stickers, decorations, music, backdrops, objects and materials. Whilst users are required to purchase this pack in order to create levels with water and water-related items, users are able to play levels utilising the features whether they purchase the pack or not.
Game of the Year Edition.
A "Game of the Year Edition" of "LittleBigPlanet" was released in North America on 8 September 2009. This version included all of the content from the original game, as well as exclusive levels from 18 members of the "LittleBigPlanet" community (along with short videos of each of them explaining the levels). The re-release also includes the ""Metal Gear Solid"", "Monsters", and "History" costume and level packs and the "Animals" costume pack. A limited number of copies of the game also included a code, giving the player access to a beta of "ModNation Racers". Initially there were no plans to release the "Game of the Year Edition" in Europe, however a European version was eventually announced for release on 16 April 2010. The Korean language version of the "Game of the Year Edition" is available in South Korea.
Reception.
Previews.
The unveiling of "LittleBigPlanet" at GDC 2007 elicited numerous positive reactions. In his BBC News blog, technology editor Darren Waters wrote, ""LittleBigPlanet" is perhaps one of the most dazzling demos I've seen in the last 10 years". IGN described the game as "beautiful" and reported that "even in the presence of Home, Sony's impressive new community software, "LittleBigPlanet" stole the show at Phil Harrison's Game 3.0 practice conference, and was the thing that everyone was talking about." 1UP wrote that "There are plenty of questions remaining about "LittleBigPlanet" … but it's clear from the reaction to the game so far that it has already won over many fans and that this could be something very special." Slashdot Games editor Michael Zenke suggested the game could be the PlayStation 3's killer application. Even Reggie Fils-Aime, the president of Nintendo of America, praised the product, but was unsure how the game would fare on Sony's platform.
Reviews.
"LittleBigPlanet" has received wide critical acclaim from reviewers. The first major publication to review "LittleBigPlanet" was the UK edition of "PlayStation Official Magazine". In their November edition they gave the game a score of 10/10 calling it "a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand". Eurogamer scored the game 9/10. Reviewer Oli Welsh commented specifically on the game's "unforgettable visuals" and that the accurate lighting was "as total a realisation of high-definition as you'll see anywhere in games this year". He similarly praised the multiplayer gameplay as "a loosely-structured scrum of competition, collaboration and sheer, joyful mucking around". Speaking of the game's comprehensive creation and community tools in contrast with its classic platforming gameplay, he calls the game "the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one". IGN (U.S.) scored it 9.5/10 and said the game was an "instant classic". The reviewer, Chris Roper, also suggested that the game may even be a reason to purchase a PlayStation 3; "If you own a PlayStation 3, you cannot miss this. If you don’t have a PS3 yet, this is the reason to get one." GamePro scored the game 5/5 and said that the real strength of the game "is the tremendous sense of freedom and creativity that it instils in you."
"Edge" gave it a 10/10 and said "It's a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both."
Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. "Eurogamer"'s review stated that the jump timing sometimes feels "off by a fraction of a fraction of a second" and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In "IGN"'s review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay "left a few corners on what should have been a razor-sharp control scheme". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration "isn't as quick as it could be" but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that "there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that "The Z movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right. There's times when it annoys me actually." He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended "in a somewhat disappointing manner" and the story as a whole doesn't make sense.
Awards.
"LittleBigPlanet" has been given numerous awards. It won in eight categories out of 10 nominations at the AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards including "Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction", "Visual Engineering", "Game Design", "Game Direction", and "Outstanding Innovation in Gaming" and was judged "Family Game of the Year", "Console Game of the Year", and as "Overall Game of the Year". "LittleBigPlanet" was also given the "Award for Artistic Achievement" at the 5th British Academy Video Games Awards. It was dubbed Game of the Year by several gaming websites and publications including "GamePro", "Edge", and Eurogamer whose editors felt that while the single-player experience was nothing special, the multiplayer gameplay brought the game into its own and were impressed by some of the user-created levels which inspired "gasps of wonder". It also received various other awards from gaming websites in 2008 including "Best New IP" and "Best Platform Game" from IGN and "Most Innovative Game" from GameTrailers. "LittleBigPlanet" was judged "Best PlayStation 3 Game" at the 2008 Spike Video Game Awards and was given the awards for "Best New Debut", "Best Game Design", "Best Technology", and the "Innovation Award" at the Game Developers Choice Awards.
Sales.
In the UK, the game entered the ELSPA video game charts at number four, then fell to number 19 in its second week of sale. By 29 November 2008, the game was at number 32 and had sold between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the game sold 356,000 units during October and November placing it fourth amongst all PlayStation 3 software sales for that period. It entered October's all-platform video game chart at number eight before falling out of the top 20 by the end of November. Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said "In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so you have to put the chart in context." Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, "LittleBigPlanet" was released mid-week and as a result, its first week performance indicators are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, "LittleBigPlanet" sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009. In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3 million unique users playing "LittleBigPlanet". As of March 2010, the game has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. SCEE President Andrew House announced at Gamescom 2010 that the game has now sold over 4.5 million worldwide.
Sequel.
Statements from Media Molecule and Sony indicated that there were initially no plans to create a traditional sequel to "LittleBigPlanet". Alex Evans stated that the "huge emotional investment" users have made in "LittleBigPlanet" is the reason he does not want to ship a traditional sequel. Because they do not want all of the user-generated content to be made obsolete, their focus would be to "expand the game without partitioning the audience".
In May 2010, Media Molecule announced that recent rumours of a full sequel were true and that "LittleBigPlanet 2" was in development, and that users would be able to use all the DLC released for "LittleBigPlanet" and all its user-generated content. Games magazine "GameInformer" revealed the first details of "LittleBigPlanet 2" in its June 2010 edition. The game was released in January 2011.
PSP game.
In a February 2009 press release, Sony announced a version of "LittleBigPlanet" for the PlayStation Portable would be developed by SCE Studio Cambridge in conjunction with Media Molecule. "LittleBigPlanet" for the PSP was first shown publicly at E3 2009 and it was released in November 2009.

Majd al-Krum

Majd al-Krum (, "Majd al-Kurum") is an Arab town located in the Upper Galilee in Israel's North District about 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of Acre. The name of the village translates to "watch-house of the vineyard", reflecting the town's fame for the quality of its grape vines. The town is entirely inhabited by Muslims. In 2009 it had a population of roughly 13,500.
History.
Majd al-Krum is is an ancient site in the plain at the foot of Jabal Mahüz. Ancient remains, including cisterns dug into the rock, have been found.
The name comes from the "watch-house of the vineyard" in Arabic. Majd al-Kurum receives it name for its history of growing grapes. Ancient ruins (located on the outskirts of the town), consisting of pits built into the rocks where the residents used their feet to press their grape crop to make wine. According to the "Jewish Enyclopedia" the town is identified with "Beit HaKerem", a Jewish Talmudic town. It's Hebrew name means the same as its Arabic name.
Ottoman era.
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Majd al-Krum appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the "Nahiya" of Akka of the "Liwa" of Safad. It had a population of 85 households and five bachelors, all Muslim, and paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives or fruit trees, cotton, and goats and/or beehives. 
In 1875 the French explorer Victor Guérin visited and described Majd al-Krum as being devided into three quarters, each with a different Sheikh. The total population was 800 Muslims, while in 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's "Survey of Western Palestine" described it as a village built of stone and surrounded by olive trees and arable land, inhabited by 600–800 Muslims.
British Mandatory period.
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Majd al-Krum had a population of 889, 885 (Sunni) Muslim, 3 Shia and one Christian. In the 1931 census, Majd al-Krum had 226 occupied houses and a population of 1,006 Muslims. By 1945, Majd al-Kurum had 1,400 inhabitants, all classified as Arabs. They owned a total of 17,828 dunams of land, while 2214 dunams were public property.
During the 1936-39 Arab revolt in Palestine against British Mandatory rule and increased Jewish immigration, Majd al-Krum was one of the first villages in the Galilee to participate in the revolt with native Abu Faris claiming he was the first individual to take up arms in the Galilee during the revolt and the first to have his house demolished by the British as punishment. Abu Faris became the second-in-command of the revolt in Galilee until 1938 when he refused an order to assassinate an Palestinian Arab supporter of the Peel Commission partition plan for Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Abu Faris later left Palestine for Lebanon after the political leader of the revolt, Amin al-Husayni, ordered his assassination.
1948 War and aftermath.
Majd al-Krum was captured by Israeli forces in October 1948 during Operation Hiram. A unit of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) that had been stationed there withdrew from the village upon the Israelis' approach. As he was departing, the ALA's Iraqi commander assembled the inhabitants around the village well and suggested that they not flee the village, but rather stay and surrender to Israeli officers that they knew. Accordingly, a group of Majd al-Krum's residents contacted Haim Auerbach, an Israeli intelligence officer based in Nahariya (who a group of villagers had previously defended from an attack near Acre.) Auerbach arranged for Majd al-Krum's surrender and pledged no harm would come to the village.
However, on 6 November, an Israeli Army unit, unaware of the village's surrender, entered the village and confronted the other Israeli unit already present in the village. The two sides realized their mistake after a brief exchange of fire, and the latter unit was replaced by the incoming unit. The new unit ordered the residents to hand over their weapons within 30 minutes despite having already surrendered their arms a week prior. Before the deadline was reached, the commanding Israeli officer ordered the demolition of a home and gathered five residents, blindfolded them and executed them by gunfire to demonstrate their seriousness. They gathered another five residents to execute, but were stopped by a known Palestinian Arab informant from al-Damun, Shafiq Buqa'i. Buqa'i requested the Israeli officers free the residents by explaining to them the earlier agreement made between the villagers and Auerbach.
During the 1948 War, the village of Sha'ab was largely depopulated and most of its residents settled in Majd al-Krum, some permanently and others temporarily. Many people who fled Majd al-Krum settled in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. A former fighter from the village, Abed Bishr, leased a small plot of land outside Beirut and founded the Shatila refugee camp and gathered other refugees from Majd al-Krum to settle there. According to historian Julie Peteet, the role of Majd al-Krum and its refugees "was foundational in its camp's establishment."
Contemporary period.
In the 1960s Israel confiscated a large percentage of land from Majd al-Krum to form the city of Karmiel. The town was made a local council in 1964. In the center of Majd al-Krum, there is an ancient well, a spring, a Roman-era tomb and ruins dating to the Crusader period. In 1966, efforts on a master plan began and were completed in 1978. However, the master plan was not approved by the authorities and while the population grew from 4,000 to 6,700 between 1966 and 1990, no new land was allocated to Majd al-Krum to cope with population growth. 
In 1977, large anti-government demonstrations were held in Majd al-Krum and nearby villages to protest the demolition of a house in Majd al-Krum built near the road between Safed and Acre. One person was killed and several others injured as police attempted to disperse protesters. The incident prompted mayor Muhammad Manna to leave the Labor Party and join the Hadash party. Manna was subsequently reelected in 1986. Tawfiq Ziad, a member of the Knesset, declared as long as there are stones in the Galilee, we shall use them to stone those who try to destroy our homes." The protest and the response of the state led to more assertive opposition by Israel's Arab community toward state policies.
In 2003 Majd al-Krum along with the nearby local councils of Deir al-Asad and Bi'ina merged to form the city of Shaghur. During the 2006 Lebanon War, over 40 Katyusha rockets landed in the vicinity of Shaghur, with the nearby city of Karmiel being the apparent target. Two men from Majd al-Krum, Baha' Karim and Muhammad Subhi Mana', were killed when a rocket struck near them. Shaghur was later dissolved in 2009.

The Gailer School

The Gailer School was a co-educational independent day school for grades 7–12, located in Middlebury, Vermont.
History.
The school was founded in 1989 by Harry Chaucer, a former high school science teacher, based on his experiences with running the Chaucer house at the Champlain Valley Union High School in Hinesburg, Vermont. Dr. Chaucer followed the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools as he designed the curriculum, placing a special emphasis on finding original sources, using those sources to develop a thesis, and then testing that thesis.
During its first year, the Gailer School operated out of Chaucer's living room. From 1990 to 1998, it rented an unused school building in Middlebury, Vermont, from the Catholic diocese. It drew its student body primarily from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties and hosted a number of international students, primarily from Indonesia. During the 1997-1998 school year, the school had its highest enrollment, with over 80 students. In 1998, Gailer was quietly evicted from this location because the diocese wanted to re-start its Catholic grammar school and needed its building back. 
During the summer of 1998, Gailer moved from Middlebury to Shelburne, Vermont, where it would rent a space from 1998 through 2006. At this time the Board of Trustees was controlled by parents from the greater Burlington area who did not want their own children to be inconvenienced by a long commute. Chaucer also believed at the time that replacing the less affluent Rutland County segment of the school population with more affluent students from greater Burlington would guarantee a steady source of revenue for the school. Analysis of a student and staff phone list from this time shows that approximately 1/3 of staff and students each came from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties. However, a report penned by Chaucer and the Board from this time claimed that over 75% of their students were traveling from the Burlington area in 1997-98. 
As a result of the move, Gailer's student and staff turnover was over 50% per year in the period between 1998 and 2000. At the end of the 1999-2000 academic year, the school lost over half of its students and approximately half of its staff. 
In 2006, the Board of Trustees looked at student demographics, costs, and local competition from other progressive schools, and decided to move the school back to its original home in Middlebury. 
In the spring of 2009, the school purchased the building at 54 Creek Road in Middlebury. However, this upswing was short-lived. After several consecutive years of being unable to generate sufficient tuition revenue in a bad economy, the school ceased operations in May of 2012, after 23 years.

Harry Chaucer named the school's educational program for Leonardo da Vinci. The original curriculum was history-based, beginning with the origin of the universe and extending to contemporary times.
The "da Vinci" curriculum stressed interdisciplinary learning, encouraging students to see the interconnectedness of science, history, mathematics, language and the written word. Classes included seminar-based discussions, lectures, student presentations, field work and group projects. Each student also took a weekly "master class", allowing the in-depth study of a chosen subject. Students also were required to perform community service to encourage and understand their connectedness to their community. Gailer was one of the first schools in Vermont to introduce community service into its curriculum.
The school aimed to foster the development of skills necessary for students to succeed in college and the world:

Svatopluk II

Svatopluk II or Svätopluk II (Latin: "Zentobolchus") was a member of the House of Mojmír and Prince in Moravia (maybe of Nitra) from 894 to 899, as which he strove to control all of Great Moravia.
Life.
Svatopluk II was a younger son of Svatopluk I. As Prince of Nitra, Svatopluk II was subordinated to his older brother Mojmír II, the King of Great Moravia which contained the principality as its province. Svatopluk II rebelled against his brother in 898 in an attempt to take over control of Great Moravia. Their conflict climaxed when Bavarian troops intervened in the winter of 898/899. Mojmír II defeated the Bavarians and captured Svatopluk II, but the Bavarians managed to rescue him and brought him to East Francia. Svatopluk II returned to the Principality of Nitra in 901. He probably died in 906 in fights with the Hungarians, who began to invade the Carpathian Basin in 896. Historical records contain no mention of Mojmír II, Svatopluk II, or their possible successors in connection with the three battles of Bratislava where the invading tribes defeated the Bavarian army.

Frank Bonilla

Professor Frank Bonilla (February 3, 1925 – December 28, 2010) was an American academic of Puerto Rican descent who became a leading figure in Puerto Rican Studies. After earning his doctorate from Harvard University, where his dissertation was supervised by Talcott Parsons, he had held faculty positions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the City University of New York. He is a key figure in the establishment of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Leadership Forum and the Center for Puerto Rico Studies at the City University of New York.
Biography.
Bonilla was born in New York City in 1925. His parents were both from Puerto Rico and had moved to the United States early in their lives. His mother emigrated to the United States in hopes of attending college, and his father had been a cigar maker and had served in the U.S. Cavalry. They were on the same boat going to the United States, and it was there where they met and began their courtship.
Bonilla was raised around East Harlem, a neighborhood full of diversity of culture and race. He said that children were very often exposed to multiple languages at an early age and that they became bilingual to interact with people in their day-to-day lives. Bonilla spent his first years of high school attending a Franciscan high school in Illinois, where he showed academic and leadership skills. His favorite subjects were classical Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, and German. He was also elected President of his class. Bonilla then transferred to Morris High School (Bronx, New York). After he graduated from Morris high in 1943, he was drafted and assigned to a weapons platoon. Bonilla was taught to be a mortar gunner and was assigned to the 290th Infantry Regiment, 75th Infantry Division.
World War II service.
The 290th Infantry Regiment, 75th Infantry Division was involved in the Battle of the Bulge. Bonilla served in this battle at the front of the line for nearly a month. 
After serving at the front lines, Bonilla sustained an injury and had to be hospitalized in France. After a brief three week hospitalization, Bonilla was reassigned to a replacement depot in France. It was there that he was invited to join the Puerto Rican National Guard near Frankfurt and assigned as the company clerk. He soon realized that the Puerto Rican soldiers had a divide. The Puerto Rican soldiers raised in the United States were looked down upon by those who had grown up in Puerto Rico, and referred to the emigrated Puerto Ricans as "American Joes". Bonilla said of this experience, "The military experience helped to consolidate my sense of being Puerto Rican and also a sense of wanting to study and be a scholar."
Post-war career.
Bonilla returned to the United States after he was discharged from the military and made use of the educational benefits of the G.I. Bill to attend the College of the City of New York. He graduated cum laude in 1949 with a B.A. in business administration. He went on to pursue a master’s degree in sociology from New York University, which he earned in 1954. He attended Harvard University and received a doctorate in sociology soon after.
Dr. Bonilla played a key role in the formation of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Leadership Forum to help manage the needs of Puerto Ricans in New York. He also played an instrumental role in the formation of the Center for Puerto Rico Studies at the City University of New York, where he served as founding director until his retirement in 1995. He died after a long illness on December 28, 2010.

Snipets

Snipets was a series of 30-second to 1 minute long short films for children which were produced by Kaiser Broadcasting, and later Field Communications. They ran on Kaiser/Field TV stations and were also syndicated to additional stations in the U.S.
One of the most memorable Snipets was the "Come Back Here Can", which showed kids how they could take a coffee can and a rubber band and create a toy that would roll back to them when pushed.
During its first year on the air, the theme song for "Snipets" was Popcorn by the band Hot Butter. The opening was soon shortened to eliminate the brief song clip.
Approximately 100 Snipets were produced between 1972 and 1978. They aired until approximately sometime in 1982 on Field Communications Stations, and held on for a few more years in sporadic showings on other non-Field Stations.
A common misspelling of these shorts is "Snippets".

Gorgo, Queen of Sparta

Gorgo, Queen of Sparta (; ; fl. 480 BC) was the daughter and the only known child of Cleomenes I, King of Sparta (r. 520–490 BC) during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. She was the wife of King Leonidas I, Cleomenes' half-brother, who fought and died in the Battle of Thermopylae. Gorgo is noted as one of the few female historical figures actually named by Herodotus, and was known for her political judgement and wisdom. She is notable for being the daughter of a King of Sparta, the wife of another king of Sparta, and the mother of a third king of Sparta. Her birth date is uncertain, but is most likely to have been between 518 and 508 BC, based on Herodotus dating ("Histories" 5.51).
Family background.
Her father Cleomenes was the eldest-born son of the previous Agiad king, Anaxandridas II, and succeeded his father at his death; however, he had three paternal half-brothers, of whom the second, Dorieus, would cause him some trouble. The other two half-brothers were Leonidas I and Cleombrotus. All four were sons of Anaxandridas II, one of the dual kings of Sparta of the Agiad house.
According to one version (Herodotus's "Histories", 5.4), Gorgo's grandfather Anaxandridas II was long married without children, and was advised to remarry (i.e. take a second wife) which he did. His second wife gave birth to the future Cleomenes I who was thus his eldest son; however, his first wife subsequently became pregnant, and eventually gave birth to three sons, including Leonidas I. This version is however not supported by other sources, which imply that Cleomenes was either born by the king's first marriage or by a non-marital alliance. In either case, there appears to have been some tension between the eldest son and his half-brothers, resolved only by the former's death (or murder) and the accession of Leonidas I (at once his half-brother and his son-in-law).
Gorgo's mother is unknown, but she was certainly Spartan since she was Leonidas' Queen. Little about Gorgo's childhood is known, although she was probably raised like other Spartan girls of noble family, well fed, encouraged in daily physical exercise, and educated, including literacy and numeracy. She would have learned to ride and drive chariots and have taken part in Sparta's many festivals, dancing and singing in chorus.
According to Herodotus's Histories, at about the age of eight to nine years old, she advised her father Cleomenes not to trust Aristagoras of Miletus, a foreign diplomat trying to induce Cleomenes to support an Ionian revolt against Persians. "Father, you had better have this man go away, or the stranger will corrupt you." Cleomenes followed her advice. Scholars have suggested, however, that Herodotus intentionally reduced Gorgo's age at the time of this incident to make her father look particularly foolish. More likely, Herodotus underestimated her age simply because in other Greek cities girls were married at age 12 or 13 and so rarely in their father's household as teenagers or adults. It is more probable, that Gorgo was closer to 18 or 19 at the time of this incident.
Marriage and reign.
Presumably, after Cleomenes's death, his only surviving child Gorgo became his sole heiress. She was apparently already married by 490 (in her early teens) to her half-uncle Leonidas I. Leonidas and Gorgo would have at least one child, a son, Pleistarchus, co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 459 BC/458 BC.
Arguably, Gorgo's most significant role occurred prior to the Persian invasion of 480 BC. According to Herodotus's "Histories", Demaratus, then in exile at the Persian court, sent a warning to Sparta about Xerxes's pending invasion. In order to prevent the message from being intercepted by the Persians or their vassal states, the message was written on a wooden tablet and then covered with wax. "The Spartans", presumably the ephors, Gerousia or the kings, did not know what to do with the seemingly blank wax-tablet, until Queen Gorgo advised them to clear the wax off the tablet. She is described by David Kahn in his book The Codebreakers as one of the first female cryptanalysts whose name has been recorded.
There are also indications that Gorgo travelled outside of Sparta, specifically to Athens. Virtually all of Leonidas' reign was dominated by his efforts to form a coalition of Greek states willing to resist the impending Persian invasion. This entailed close coordination with the other main opponent of Persia, Athens. It is likely, therefore, that Leonidas travelled to Athens more than once. That Gorgo accompanied can be inferred from two quotes attributed to her by Plutarch. First, he records that "a stranger in a finely embroidered robe" made advances to Gorgo earning the rebuke that "he couldn't even play a female role". While a stranger might have been in Sparta, it is not very likely that he would risk making advances to a Spartan Queen in the midst of her highly armed and notoriously proud subjects. More to the point, however, Gorgo could only make a reference to the theater (playing a female role), if she had experienced it. Sparta is not believed to have had theater at this time, whereas it was already very popular in Athens. Even more explicit is the fact that Gorgo's most famous quip about only Spartan women giving birth to men was, according to Plutarch, made in answer to "a woman from Attica". Since women from Attica were not supposed to leave the women's quarters of their own homes, it is inconceivable that a woman from Attica would have travelled to Sparta. Spartan women, on the other hand, drove chariots and travelled around Lacedaemon on their own, making it perfectly plausible that Gorgo travelled with her husband (and his bodyguard) on one or more of his trips to other Greek cities.
According to Plutarch, before the Battle of Thermopylae, knowing that her husband's death in battle was inevitable, she asked him what to do. Leonidas replied "marry a good man who will treat you well, bear him children, and live a good life".
Children.
She had at least one son by Leonidas I, Pleistarchus, co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 458 BC.
Her son was a minor at his father's death, so his uncle Cleombrotus (died 480 BC) and then his first cousin and heir Pausanias (r. 480-479 BC) acted as his regent. It was Pausanias who was the architect of the combined Greek victory at the Battle of Plataea (479 BC). When Pausanias fell into disfavor and was accused of plotting treason, Leonidas's son Pleistarchus ruled alone from 478 BC to his death 459/458 BC.
Historical mentions.
There are sections where she is present at court or in council and gives advice to the king or the elders. This either indicates that Gorgo was highly thought of by Herodotus who often left out the names of the female figures he included in his books, or that as the wife of Leonidas I, her actions and counsel were all the more noteworthy.
Plutarch quotes Queen Gorgo as follows: 
"When asked by a woman from Attica, 'Why are you Spartan women the only ones who can rule men?', she said: 'Because we are also the only ones who give birth to men.'" Another version has this as, "...some foreign lady, as it would seem, told her that the women of Lacedaemon were the only women in the world who could rule men; 'With good reason,' she said, 'for we are the only women who bring forth men.'" (Plutarch's "Lives": Lycurgus)
In popular culture.
Queen Gorgo was portrayed by Greek actress and future politician Anna Synodinou in the 1962 film "The 300 Spartans".
Gorgo appears as a major character in "Sacred Games", by Gary Corby.
The character makes a minor appearance in the 1998 comic series "300" by Frank Miller, who was heavily inspired by the aforementioned film.
In the 2007 motion picture adaptation of the comic, "300", English actress Lena Headey plays Gorgo. In this version, she is given a more important role in the events surrounding the war with Persia; she tries to convince others to bring support to Leonidas, has sex with a council member in order to support her claim, and then kills that member and reveals him as a traitor. Headey reprised her role in the 2014 sequel, "".
In the 2008 film "Meet the Spartans", a parody of "300", Carmen Electra plays a parody of the character named "Queen Margo".
Helena P. Schrader has published the first book in a three-part biographical novel on Leonidas and Gorgo. The first book, "Leonidas of Sparta: A Boy of the Agoge", focuses on Leonidas boyhood in the infamous Spartan agoge, but books two and three will give prominence to Gorgo too.
Gorgo is the title character in T.S. Chaudhry's novel, "The Queen of Sparta," and is portrayed as the real genius behind the Greek victory over the Persians.
Notes.
Sparta had a system of dual kings, from two rival but related houses, descended allegedly from twin sons of an early king of Sparta.

Barber and Calverley

Theodore Xenophon Barber (1927–2005) and David Smith Calverley (1937–2008) were psychologists who studied "hypnotic behaviour". They measured how susceptible patients were to hypnotic induction. One result of their research was showing that the hypnotic induction was not superior to motivational instructions in producing a heightened state of suggestibility. The Barber Suggestibility Scale, a product of their research, measures hypnotic susceptibility with or without the use of a hypnotic induction.

Ternan

Saint Ternan (fifth century?) is venerated as the "Bishop of the Picts." Not much is known of his life. He may have been consecrated by St. Palladius. Some scholars believe that he may have been a monk at Culross, which had been founded by St. Serf, and that he was a contemporary of Serf. Others state that he was a follower of St. Ninian.
Life.
Ternan, is believed to have been born in Fordoun in Angus about AD 440. He established a small monastery on the north side of the River Dee near the current graveyard in what is now the town of Banchory. As well as preaching the Christian gospel, he and his followers taught the local people farming, arts and crafts. Churches in Banchory and surrounding area bear the name of St Ternan. 
The story of Ternan features two key artifacts, his copy of Matthew's Gospel and his bell or "Ronnecht": 
The "Aberdeen Martyrology" mentions "the Gospel of Matthew belonging to St. Ternan", which was enshrined in a metal case or "cumdach" (book shrine)and is said to have remained in Banchory until the reformation. The bell has an altogether more interesting story. It is said to have been brought to Banchory from Rome by Ternan, and is last recorded as being transferred to the custody of Alexander Symson, vicare of Banquhoriterne in 1491. When the glebe being excavated for the railway in 1863 an old bronze bell was found. It is not clear if this really is Ternan's bell, but it now hangs on the front wall of Banchory Ternan East Church as a visible reminder of the debt that is owed to this early pioneer of Christianity in Scotland 
He is mentioned, along with Saints Brendan, Michael etc., in some blessings and incantations, such as the milking croon of South Uist, collected by Alexander Carmichael in the Hebrides in the 1880s. 
St Ternan's feast day is June 12 and he is still celebrated on this holiday in Banchory with St Ternan's Fair which is held on the closest Saturday.

Kinnickinnic River (St. Croix River)

The Kinnickinnic River, called the Kinni for short, is a river in northwestern Wisconsin in the United States. The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout.
Designations.
The Kinnickinnic River is officially designated as a Class I trout stream by the WI DNR, indicating it is a "high quality" trout water that has sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carrying capacity. The Kinnickinnic is also designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) by the WI DNR, indicating it provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities. This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.
Name.
The city of River Falls, Wisconsin, which was named after the historic Junction Falls waterfall on the Kinnickinnic River, is situated on the river where the main branch of the Kinnickinnic River and the South Fork of the Kinnickinnic River have their confluence. The name "Kinnickinnic" is a word from the Ojibwe "giniginige", and refers to tobacco mixed with other plant material for smoking.
History.
The first settler of European descent along the Kinnickinnic River was Judge Joel Foster. He first settled in the area over the winter of 1848-1849 in a walled-in cave overhang at the confluence of the main channel and the South Fork of the Kinnickinnic River. Foster wrote about the two Native American tribes inhabiting the region—the Sioux and the Chippewa. He noted that both placed such value on the St. Croix River Valley that neither claimed it for themselves. Two brothers, Nathaniel N. and Oliver Stanley Powell, also claimed land in the vicinity in 1849. They built the first commercial structure in the City of River Falls in 1852 along the banks of the Kinnickinnic River. Foster built a sawmill and dam in 1854 which was later expanded to include a feed store and was located on the south bank of the Kinnickinnic River. Later that year, the firm of Crossman & Hart constructed a brickyard on the southern edge of the growing community along the Kinnickinnic. Four flour mills with dams in the Kinnickinnic River were established in the City of River Falls. The first was built in 1855 by C.B. Cox, who later built another mill known as the Prairie Mill, located on the west side of North Main Street.
Physical Geography.
The Kinnickinnic River rises from springs in St. Croix County and flows in a southwesterly direction before emptying into the St. Croix River in Kinnickinnic State Park. The Kinnickinnic is composed of two types of river. Above River Falls, the river flows slowly, with a sandy/silty bottom and a narrower bed. Below River Falls, the bed is wider and is generally composed of stone rather than sand or silt. A substantial amount of silt and sand are deposited in the delta, enough that that section of the St. Croix is known as the "Kinnickinnic Narrows." The water is slightly colder above the City of River Falls than below by about 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The difference in water temperature is possibly due to the two hydroelectric dams remaining in the river and their impoundments, both of which are silted in to very shallow depths, allowing the river water to stagnate and warm prior to continuing downstream. Both impoundments also experience extreme eutrophication during the warm summer months leading to significant algae blooms.
The differences in the stream make for differences in the fish population. The upper section of the river contains very high numbers of trout that are of smaller size. The warmer water below River Falls supports more minnow and crustacean life, which can support larger trout, though in fewer numbers. The extreme case of this is near the delta, where the water becomes even warmer, and the river supports warmer-water species such as smallmouth bass.
The Kinni watershed is characterized by scenic bluff lands, rare oak savanna, original prairie, farm land, white pine forest, wooded coulees, sedge meadows, rare and endangered plant species, beautiful stands of white pines and plenty of open space and scenic vistas. Its feeder creeks are cold and clean, containing wild native brook trout, important spawning areas, wetlands, and many springs arising from under picturesque limestone outcroppings.
Recreation.
The main recreational opportunity on the Kinnickinnic River is trout fishing. Some enjoy walking, hiking, running, and mountain biking along the extensive trails below the lower dam in River Falls. Kayaking along the lower stretches of the river has become popular, with three businesses shuttling kayakers to the launch point below the lower dam and picking them up at the takeout at the County F bridge near Kinnickinnic State Park.
Access is limited on the stretch of the Kinnickinnic River below the city of River Falls. Public access on the lower river is mainly gained at three spots immediately downstream from the Glen Park dam within the River Hills neighborhood, and downstream from the County Highway F bridge at Kinnickinnic State Park two miles above the mouth of the river.

Freuchie Cricket Club

Brief History.
Situated in the Fife village of Freuchie (), Scotland, the Club was formed in 1908, and with some disruption in the war years, has been going strong ever since. The cricket club plays a large role in village community life.
While the greatest moment of popular fame must be the victory in the final of the National Village Championship at Lord’s in 1985 (against a Surrey side, to give it added relish), the fact is that the standard of play, and equally importantly, of opposition, has increased steadily since that time. 
In the 1970s, virtually all games were friendlies against other village clubs, with the occasional friendly against one of the “big clubs” from Edinburgh; the club looked on these as major cricketing occasions, while the opponents thought them to be more of a social day out. Today, Freuchie Cricket Club meet these teams on a very competitive basis. Two of the present “home-grown” players have played for Scotland’s first team, while others have played at other representative levels. 
The 2006 season exemplified this rise in standards when the club began the year by winning the Media Sixes Indoor Six-a-Side tournament and went on to win the SNCL Division II championship with a game to spare. Meanwhile, the Second XI gained promotion from East League Division II, so this coming year sees the club competing in the first divisions of both the Scottish National (SNCL) and the East of Scotland (ESCA) leagues. 
The club's Centenary Year was in 2008.

David Golder

David Golder is writer Irène Némirovsky's first novel. It was re-issued in 2004 following the popularity of the Suite Française notebooks discovered in 1998. "David Golder" was first published in France in 1929 and won instant acclaim for the 26-year-old author.
Plot summary.
The novel opens with Golder refusing to help his colleague of many years, Marcus. As a result of this, Marcus, bankrupt, commits suicide. Following the funeral, Golder travels to Biarritz where he has a huge, opulent house. His wife and daughter reside there in luxury, spending Golder's cash like water. On the train, he suffers a heart attack. Seriously ill, he is forced to re-evaluate his life.
Major themes.
David Golder is a self-made man. From humble beginnings as a Jew in the Ukraine selling rags, he is now a cold, ruthless businessman. It is suggested by his wife, Gloria, that Marcus is not the only casualty of Golder's brutal dealings. However he has an Achilles heel, well hidden: his feckless daughter, Joyce. It is this weakness that eventually ruins him.
Now 68 and dying, he realises that his wealth has not brought him happiness; simply a grim satisfaction that, as "a good Jew" he has provided for his uncaring family. Gloria and Joyce are portrayed as grasping and selfish, barely showing concern or interest in Golder except when they need more money for jewellery, furs, cars and cash for their lovers.
The novel is an astonishing portrayal of a businessman and his family in the years leading up to the Great Depression. It also introduces characters of great depth, like Soifer, the old German Jew who "walks on tiptoe" to save shoe leather; he is Golder's only connection with the old world from which he himself came. His wife, Gloria, (Havke is her Yiddish name) is as beautiful, cold and hard as the jewels she so treasures. But it is Joyce, Golder's 18-year-old daughter, who is central to the story. It is she who ultimately causes his ruin.
Adaptations.
In 1930 the novel was made into a film "David Golder" directed by Julien Duvivier and starring Harry Baur as the title character.
In March 2010 the book was dramatised in five episodes on BBC Radio 4, with David Suchet as David Golder. It was directed by Peter Farago.
Autobiographical.
Nemirovsky's mother, "Fanny," whom Irene loathed, had two things in her safe when she died in 1972, a copy of Jezebel and David Golder.

Networx

The GSA Networx is the largest set of government contracts for civilian telecommunication to date in the United States. It consists of two contract vehicles - Networx Universal and Networx Enterprise. Multiple awards for each contract are made to contractors chosen under full and open competition rules. It is a contract vehicle to support the Trusted Internet Connection initiative by OMB.
Networx Universal is the large contract vehicle, and is expected to meet most of the governments requirements for telecommunications services and solutions. Its terms includes a 48-month base period plus three 24-month option periods. On March 29, 2007 three prime contractors were awarded on the Networx Universal contract: AT&T Government Solutions, Qwest Government Services, and Verizon Business Services. Although Sprint did submit a bid, it was not awarded any work under this contract.The current record shows annual revenue more than $1billion over 1,000 employees.
Networx Enterprise is the smaller contract vehicle with a program ceiling of $20 billion and is likewise expected to meet the government's requirements for telecommunications services and solutions.

Celebrity Apprentice

Celebrity Apprentice is an American reality game show and spin-off television series to the United States version of "The Apprentice". Like the show's precursor, the show is hosted by real estate magnate, businessman and television personality Donald Trump. Also like its precursor, the show's opening theme song is "For the Love of Money" by The O'Jays. Unlike its precursor, however, "Celebrity Apprentice" consists of celebrities as the competing apprentices as opposed to unknowns. The show features celebrities, typically who have been out of the public eye for quite some time or are looking for publicity for one reason or another, competing for charities. These celebrities come from a wide variety of different fields in the media: sitcoms, professional sports, music industry, reality television, radio, and other backgrounds.
"Celebrity Apprentice" is linked in seasons to its precursor TV show: "The Apprentice" which consists of seasons one through six and ten. Thus, "Celebrity Apprentice" follows up with seasons seven onwards—except for season ten which revisited the original program. Season six (number 13 overall), the most recent, aired from March to May 2013. The show was renewed for a seventh season, which is slated to air in the 2014–15 TV season.
History.
On July 6, 2007, it was announced that "The Apprentice" had been renewed for a seventh season, with a possibility of an eighth. In an effort to revitalize interest in the series, season seven featured celebrities playing the game to raise money for charities, going under the name "The Celebrity Apprentice" as opposed to continuing under "The Apprentice" format. British tabloid editor Piers Morgan was declared the victorious player of that season. On January 28, 2008, NBC confirmed that season eight would feature celebrities playing the game to raise money for charity. That season premiered in January 2009, and resulted in a win for comedian Joan Rivers.
Season three of "The Celebrity Apprentice" aired in the spring of 2010, and was won by musician Bret Michaels.
On March 17, 2010, NBC officially stated that a new season of the original "Apprentice" would be brought back, with the explanation that regular working people would again attract audiences in light of the damaged U.S. economy. That season premiered September 16, 2010. This time the ratings were low, and both Trump and Producer Mark Burnett returned to the 'Celebrity' format, which saw John Rich win in season four. In season five, late night host Arsenio Hall won. In season six, the first all-star season took place, bringing back 14 of the most memorable celebrities to compete for the first title of the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice, which country singer Trace Adkins won.
Season installments.
Existing as a sequel television series to the U.S. version of "The Apprentice",

Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport

Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport is located in Kano, the capital city of Kano State of Nigeria. It was a Royal Air Force station before the country became independent. It is the main airport serving northern Nigeria and was named after politician Aminu Kano. The airport consists of an international and a domestic terminal. The terminals share the same runway. Construction started on a new domestic terminal and was commissioned on 23 May 2011. In 2009, the airport handled 323,482 passengers.
History.
Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport is the oldest in Nigeria, with operations starting in 1936. In the first decades of operation, it became an important fuel stop for airlines flying long-haul services between Europe and Africa. Newer aircraft did not need such fuel stops any longer and, with the demise of the economy of Kano in the late 20th century, many international airlines stopped serving the airport. Until May 2012, KLM was the only European airline serving Kano, which they had done without interruption since 1947. This makes KLM the longest-serving foreign airline in Nigeria. 
The bulk of international flights cater for the large Lebanese community in Kano and Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca.
Facilities.
The airport serves civilian and military flights. Runway 06/24 is mainly used for civilian flights, while runway 05/23 primarily serves the Nigerian Air Force base at the south side of the airport. Runway 05/23 was in use for all operations, when the main runway was rehabilitated in the beginning of the 21st century. Between the two runways lie the terminal facilities.
The main terminal with the control tower serves international flights and domestic services operated by Arik Air. Facilities in the departure lounge are minimal, with a newsstand near the check-in counter and a small bar at airside. There is a small VIP lounge for business class passengers. Duty-free shops are currently closed. In the arrivals hall there is a small bar and a post office.
On the south side of the airport, along runway 06/24, is the domestic terminal currently serving operations of IRS Airlines. Facilities include a newsstand and small bar.
Construction of a new domestic terminal, adjacent to the main terminal building, started in the beginning of the 21st century. Construction was abandoned but was resumed. The operator of the airport, Federal Airports Authority Nigeria (FAAN), saw the completion of the new terminal in November 2009. It was commissioned on May 2011.

Hall Cross Academy

Hall Cross Academy (formerly Hall Cross School and Doncaster Grammar School), founded in 1350, is a co-educational academy in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England.
Admissions.
The academy is split over two sites, with the Upper academy located in the centre of Doncaster (in the Town Fields area) and the Lower academy in the north of Bessacarr, near the Dome. Hall Cross academy has specialist status as a Science College. The total number of pupils who attend the academy is over 2,000. It features as an integral part of the community, providing access to facilities for many primary schools, which also form part of its large catchment area. The headteacher of the academy is Pippa Dodgshon.
It is named after the Hall Cross on Hall Cross Hill, on the opposite side of the main road through Doncaster.
The Library and Christchurch House.
The library building is the oldest building on the Town Centre site, it was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and was built in 1869. Downstairs it features a plaque which can still be seen to this day, dedicating the building to Queen Victoria. The library is a classic example of Victorian Gothic Revival, featuring a large Hammerbeam roof decorated with flowers cut into the massive oak beams which may in fact be stained pine. The building also features a tower at one corner. Inside, the library features two massive Gothic style glass windows at either end, one of them being stained glass, designed and executed by former pupil C. Rupert Moore, which was unveiled in 1938 as a tribute to "Old Boys" from the school who died in World War I. The library features a large amount of Victorian plaques, dedicated to past headteachers of the school, men from the school who died in both wars, and other various things. The most recently added one commemorating when Prince Charles visited the school in 1989. By number of books, the library is the biggest school library in Doncaster, and is largely used by the 6th form.
Christchurch house is the school's equivalent of a "6th form block". It is a large detached Victorian Townhouse which overlooks the local church that the house is named after. The house features a grand wooden staircase, stained glass skylights, and a statue of the Venus de Milo which originally resided in the Girls' School, built in 1918. When the school was disbanded, the statue was moved to Hall Cross academy.
Remembrance Day.
Remembrance Day is one of the most important days in the academic calendar. The academy has held a ceremony every year since 1918 to remember those who attended the school and died in battle. The service begins at 9am. Speeches are made by the Head Teacher who gives thanks to those who died in conflict. Two poppy wreaths are then carried down the corridor to the library by the Head Boy and Head Girl. They are then laid by the World War one and World War two plaques respectively, whilst the Last Post is played on the trumpet, with the sounds carrying through to the library.
Trivia.
High Speed Train Power Car no. 43045 was named 'The Grammar School, Doncaster AD1350' in Spring 1984. It is now in service with East Midland's Trains and does not carry its former name. The nameplate removed from the locomotive can be found in the tower of the Academy along with a large collection of railway memorabilia.
Old Danensians.
Alumni and former staff of Doncaster Grammar School, Doncaster High School for Girls, Hall Cross Comprehensive School and Hall Cross Academy, known as Old Danensians, are able to join the Old Danensians' Club.
The object of the Club is to maintain connections between past members of the School with one another and the School, and generally promote the welfare of the foundation.
Hallcross Academy.
The 2012-2013 term saw the establishment change its name to Hall Cross Academy.
Academic performance.
The school gets GCSE results slightly above average. At A-level it performs well, with some of the best results in South Yorkshire, and the third best in Doncaster LEA. Results in Doncaster at GCSE are notably low, but they are much better at A level, similar to the situation in Grimsby and Hull.

116th Street Crew

The 116th Street crew, also known as the Uptown crew, is a powerful crew within the Genovese crime family. In the early 1960s, Anthony Salerno became one of the most powerful capos in the family. Salerno based the crew out of the "Palma Boys Social Club" located 416 East 115th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan.
History.
The 116th Street Mob.
In the early 1890s, a group of four brothers (Giuseppe Morello, and his half-brothers Nicholo, Vincenzo and Ciro Terranova) arrived in New York City from Corleone, Sicily. The Morello-Terranova brothers soon started taking over the growing "Little Italy" in East Harlem, by using the black hand technique of extorting small business and running illegal gambling operations. The group became known as the "116th Street Mob" (or "Morello gang"). With their increasing power the Morello's sought to control Lower Manhattan's Little Italy. The "Little Italy" in lower Manhattan was under the control of Ignazio "Lupo the Wolf" Saietta, Before a gang war erupted, the two sides decided on joining forces. Giuseppe Morello became the Capo di tutti capi (or "boss of bosses"), but before long he and Ignazio Saietta were arrested and charged with counterfeiting in 1910.
Nicholas "Nick Morello" Terranova took over the "116th Street Mob", and became embroiled in the Mafia-Camorra War. This conflict was between the Sicilian "Morello-Terranova family" and "Brooklyn Camorra gangs" led by Pellegrino Morano. Each side wanted to completely control all the Italian gangs in New York City and across the United States. On September 7, 1916 Nicholas Terranova was murdered, giving the Camorra gangs the advantage. The next leaders of the "Morello family" were brothers Vincenzo and Ciro Terranova. They continued the war and within months police began arresting top members of the Camorra gangs. This allowed the Sicilians to maintain dominance and control over New York City and the remaining Camorra gangs joined forces with Sicilian gangs. Vincent continued operating from Brooklyn, and Ciro continued expanding his operations in East Harlem and The Bronx.
The Artichoke King.
Ciro "The Artichoke King" Terranova controlled the "116th Street Crew" during the prohibition era. In his later years, after being "encouraged" by younger gangsters to retire in 1935 and subsequently declaring bankruptcy and losing his Pelham Manor home to foreclosure, Terranova and his wife moved into the building long owned by the Morello-Terranova family at 338 East 116th Street (the headquarters of the Ignatz Florio Co-operative Association).
Coppola's policy racket.
Michael "Trigger Mike" Coppola, was a top lieutenant in the "116th Street crew" of Ciro Terranova. He took over the crew sometime between 1932 and 1936, after Terranova was "put on the shelf" (i.e. forced into retirement) by the new "Luciano-Genovese-Costello regime" of the Luciano crime family. Coppola was also supervising the illegal "numbers racket" that was once controlled by Dutch Schultz before his murder. The numbers racket controlled bookmaking and illegal gambling throughout Harlem and The South Bronx, making thousands of dollars a year.
When boss Vito Genovese was imprisoned in the late 1950s, various influential members began running the crime family through a "ruling panel/committee". The panel consisted of "acting/front boss" Thomas "Tommy Ryan" Eboli, underboss Gerardo "Gerry" Catena and consigliere Michele "Big Mike" Miranda, while others served in the advisory capacity. Mike Coppola, an influential capo, also helped the panel. In the early 1960s, Mike Coppola was imprisoned on tax evasion charges and followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Ciro Terranova, being put on the shelf after his release from prison in 1963. Coppola later moved to South Florida and effectively retired. His crew, with his vast illegal interests went to Anthony Salerno.
Palma Boys crew.
Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno, started as a soldier in the 1930s under capo, Michael Coppola. As years went by, Salerno worked his way up the ranks of the crew and the crime family, controlling his own lucrative gambling and loansharking operations. In the early 1960s, his capo Coppola was imprisoned on tax evasion charges and demoted in rank. The crew then split, allowing Coppola's top lieutenants to break up his vast illegal interests that included his "numbers empire". Salerno based the 116th Street Crew from the Palma Boys Social Club located at 416 East 115th Street in East Harlem.
Anthony Salerno, and his brother Cirino (known as "Charles" or "Charlie Speed") led the crew, operating in East Harlem and the Bronx. He was usually found sitting out front on patio furniture smoking his ever-present cigar and holding meetings with underlings, or in the kitchen cooking some Italian dish for the boys. The Salerno brothers oversaw a multi-million dollar gambling racket based in East Harlem that expanded into the South Bronx. Tony Salerno's gambling empire included numbers, bookmaking and floating dice games. Even when the East Harlem neighborhood went from a predominately Italian to a predominately black neighborhood, Salerno managed to hold onto their interests and employ over 200 people in their street rackets.
Anthony Salerno was a highly respected and feared gangster, and a well-known New York Mafia powerhouse who continued to rise through the ranks of the Genovese crime family becoming consigliere from 1972–75, underboss in 1975, and eventually the "acting–front boss" from 1981-86. In the late 1970s, the FBI managed to place a bug (or listening device) in his East Harlem headquarters, the Palma Boys Social Club. By the early 1980s, Salerno had been caught on the bug discussing crime family affairs and business with various members, including top underlings such as capo Matthew "Matty the Horse" Ianniello, Salerno driver and right-hand-man Vincent "Fish" Cafaro, and even Lucchese crime family boss Anthony "Tony Ducks" Corallo, whose own Jaguar, where Corallo conducted much of his affairs had also been bugged. In February 1985, the information obtained through the FBI bug was used to eventually indict Salerno and the bosses of New York's Five Families, who sat on The Commission. The Mafia Commission Trail began in September 1986 and ended in November. Tony Salerno, along with five other New York bosses were convicted under the RICO statute and sentenced to 100 years in prison in January 1987.
Bellomo era.
Liborio "Barney" Bellomo took over the crew in the early 1980s, operating in East Harlem and the South Bronx. In the early 1990s, Bellomo was promoted to "street boss" for imprisoned boss Vincent "The Chin" Gigante. On July 27, 1992 former capo Anthony Salerno died in prison. Bellomo was imprisoned, and various acting leaders such as Frank "Farby" Serpico and Ernest "Ernie" Muscarella controlled the crew.

Johnny Gooch

John Beverley (Johnny) Gooch (November 9, 1897 – March 15, 1975) was an American professional baseball player, coach, minor league manager and scout. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from to , most notably for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Baseball career.
Born in Smyrna, Tennessee, Gooch began his professional baseball career in 1916 at the age of 18 with the Talladega Tigers of the Georgia-Alabama League. He didn't play professionally in 1917 or 1918 as he returned to help on the family farm after his oldest brother had died in a drowning accident and his second oldest brother had been called into military service during World War I. Gooch was also called into military service and was aboard a train heading to the service when news of the Armistice broke.
In 1918, Gooch tried out to play for the New Orleans Pelicans but didn't make the team. Despite this setback, the eager Gooch continued to show up for the team's practices. His eagerness to play finally convinced the Pelicans to sign him to a contract. He was sent to play in Cleveland and then to Mobile, where he was released. The Birmingham Barons then signed him after The Barons’ manager, Carlton Molesworth, remembered his dedication during one of his team's visits to play in Mobile. It was in Birmingham where Gooch first played with future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Pie Traynor, and the two men developed a lifelong friendship. In 1920, he posted a .288 batting average in 136 games for the Barons.
Gooch made his major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 9, 1921 at the age of 22. Gooch had his best season offensively in 1922 when veteran catcher Walter Schmidt, held out for more pay and didn't play until August. He posted a career-high .329 batting average in 105 games, and collected an extra-inning six-hit game, two four-hit games, and eight three-hit games. He also had 102 assists defensively, third best in the league. In 1925, he played as a backup catcher to Earl Smith while posting a .298 batting average along with 30 runs batted in to help the Pirates win the National League pennant. The Pirates then went on to defeat the Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series. He appeared in three games of series and went hitless in 3 at bats. 
Gooch played in 101 games in 1927 and had a career-high 48 runs batted in, as the Pirates once again won the National League championship. However, they faced the powerful New York Yankees led by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the 1927 World Series and were defeated in four straight games. In 1928, the Pirates acquired future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Burleigh Grimes, who was the last pitcher allowed to throw the spitball in the major leagues. Pirates manager, Donie Bush chose Gooch to be Grimes' personal catcher, due to his previous experience at catching the tricky spitball.
After spending six and a half years with the Pirates, Gooch was traded in June 1928 along with Joe Harris to the Brooklyn Robins in exchange for Charlie Hargreaves, as the Pirates were seeking a right-handed batter. It was also reported that he had fallen out of favor with the Pirates because of a salary dispute during the off-season. News reports surfaced in January 1929 that Gooch wasn't happy in Brooklyn after having spent so many years in Pittsburgh, and was contemplating retirement. That April, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Val Picinich. He experienced a rejuvenation by hitting for a .300 batting average in 92 games for the seventh-place Reds. After one more season with the Reds where his batting average dropped to .243, he was traded to the Nashville Volunteers in the Southern Association for Joe Cicero. He posted a .334 batting average in 117 games during the Volunteers' 1932 season. In January 1933, he returned to the major leagues when his contract was bought by the Boston Red Sox. Gooch's playing time was diminished when the Red Sox acquired catcher Rick Ferrell in May. He appeared in 37 games for the Red Sox and played in his final major league game on September 12, 1933 at the age of 37.
Career statistics.
In an eleven-year major league career, Gooch played in 805 games, accumulating 662 hits in 2,363 at-bats for a .280 career batting average along with 7 home runs, 293 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .342. He had a career fielding percentage of .973.
Managerial and coaching career.
Gooch was hired by the Cincinnati Reds to be a player-manager for the Durham Bulls of the Piedmont League in December 1935. He was credited with helping young pitcher, Johnny Vander Meer cure the wildness of his pitching. Vander Meer went on to become the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to pitch two consecutive no hitters. Gooch was then hired as the manager for the Mount Airy Reds of the Bi-State League. In January 1937, the Pittsburgh Pirates hired Gooch to be their pitching coach, at the urging of his old friend, Pie Traynor, who was then managing the Pirates. In October 1939, the Pirates released him as a coach, then immediately rehired him as a scout. The Pirates then named him to be the manager for their minor league affiliate, the Hutchinson Pirates of the Western Association for the 1941 season. His final year in baseball was 1942, as a player-manager for the Bluefield Blue-Grays in the Mountain State League.
Later life.
After retiring from baseball management, Gooch opened a baseball bat factory in Nashville. In 1972, Gooch was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.
Gooch died on May 15, 1975 in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 77.

Memiş Agha

Hacı Yakupoğlu Memiş Agha was born in Balıklı village of Sürmene in 1799 or 1804.
Information.
He is the son of Hajji Yakup Agha. He was the last chief landowner of the region. In 1814, he was guilty for harassment of the other tribe aghas, so Yakup Agha emigrated to İstanbul. He then emigrated from there to Romania. At the age of 15, Memiş Aga completely takes the control of the region by putting up resistance to these Aghas who take his father away from his country. With approval as Ayan landowner, Memiş Agha is entrusted by Ottoman Empire in 1819. By 1824 Ayan landownership of Memiş Agha is supported and strengthened with new powers so control of nearby settlement areas is turned over him. By given the rank of captain in 1846, he becomes the representative of military forces in the region. He is entrusted by Ottoman Empire to catch and to deliver the deserters in 1854. Memiş Agha Mansion was constructed by Memiş Agha himself 10 years later on that he had been rewarded with rank of captain and had joined the army. 1846+ 10 = 1856 is the construction year of the Memiş Agha Mansion.

Stalingrad (wargame)

Stalingrad is strategic-level board wargame published by Avalon Hill in 1963. As one of the first board wargames (and the first one about the Eastern Front of World War II) it was extensively played and discussed during the early years of the wargaming hobby.
Despite its title, "Stalingrad" covers the entire campaign between Germany and the Soviet Union from June 1941 to May 1943. Often criticized for lack of realism, Stalingrad is the granddaddy of the many eastern front games that have since been published.
Germany wins the game by occupying the cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad and holding them for two turns simultaneously or eliminating all opposing units. The Soviets win by avoiding the German victory conditions or eliminating all German units.
The game is played on a 22x28 inch mounted hex grid map of the eastern front with a scale of about 30 miles per hex. Cardboard counters represent military units (generally army corps), each game turn represents one month. Key terrain features include major cities, rivers, rough terrain and swamps. Defenders can gain advantages in battle by occupying cities, rough terrain and defending behind rivers. Variable weather effects in fall, winter and spring months affect the movement rate of combat units.
Except for some Italian and Hungarian units, there are no reinforcements in the game. The armed forces of both sides are replenished by replacements. Replacements are eliminated units, which are returned to the game. The production capability of the Soviets is reflected in the replacement rate, which rises during the game.
The sequence of play and combat resolution in Stalingrad are similar to other Avalon Hill games published in the 1960s, including "Afrika Korps" and "D-Day". In each turn, a player moves his forces, and then executes attacks. In some situations, the attacker may advance a hex after combat. The combat results table of "Stalingrad" is identical to the other two games. Players of Stalingrad are encouraged to use “soak-off” attacks, which give the attacker a good chance of eliminating an enemy unit, in return for the likely sacrifice of a friendly unit.
There are several criticisms of the game. Although the game is very competitive, it is not a good simulation of the campaign. The exploitation of breakthroughs by mechanized forces is absent as the opponent moves directly after combat, allowing him a chance to plug any holes in the line, and pull units out of threatened positions. A component of blitzkrieg warfare, tactical air power, is missing from the game. The time frame of "Stalingrad" covers parts of three years. During that time, the organization and order of battle of both armies changed significantly, but the game does not reflect any changes. In the numerous eastern front games that have followed after "Stalingrad", game designers have addressed these and other issues of realism and playability.

53rd Street Crosstown Line

The 53rd Street Crosstown Line was a surface transit line in Manhattan, New York City, United States, running along 53rd Street in Midtown, between Sixth Avenue and Ninth Avenue. It served as a connection between north-south lines during the times that they were not affiliated with the 59th Street Crosstown Line. The street is no longer used by buses, which now use 59th Street to make the crosstown connection.
History.
The tracks in 53rd Street were added in 1894, when the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, a cable car line, opened. However, the Metropolitan had a lease on the Central Park, North and East River Railroad, the owner of the 59th Street Crosstown Line, and used 59th Street as a connection in the Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line. After the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line was converted to electricity in 1901, those cars were also moved to 59th Street, and a new service - the 53rd Street Line - was added. The route began at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street and traveled north on Sixth Avenue for three blocks, west on 53rd Street to Ninth Avenue, and north on Ninth Avenue to 54th Street.
Effective August 6, 1908, the CPN&ER was separated from the bankrupt Metropolitan, and three lines - the Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue Line, Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, and Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line - were placed on 53rd.
The Ninth Avenue Railroad, which owned the trackage on 53rd Street between Seventh and Ninth Avenues, was split from New York Railways, the Metropolitan's successor, in 1919. The Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue Line and Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line were discontinued, while the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line remained, using trackage rights over the Ninth Avenue's trackage on 53rd Street and Ninth Avenue south of Broadway to reach Columbus Avenue. The Ninth Avenue Railroad brought back the old 53rd Street shuttle to Sixth Avenue.
On February 12, 1936, New York City Omnibus Corporation buses replaced the trolleys on the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, ending use of the 53rd Street tracks. The replacement bus - now the M7 - used 54th Street eastbound and 55th Street westbound until after the 59th Street Crosstown Line was replaced by buses.

Leskovdol

Leskovdol () is a mountainous village in Bulgaria located in Western Stara Planina in Svoge Municipality, 45 kilometers north from Sofia. It is believed that the village was founded after the building of the nearby Seven Altars Monastery. Its population is 114 people, fewer than 10 of which are children below the age of 18. Leskovdol is divided into a number of hamlets, each one consisting of 10 to 20 houses or barns. Near the village are located Trastena hut (Bulgarian:"Хижа Тръстена"), Izdremets peak, the Kom - Emine long-distance footpath and the Lakatnik rocks.
Etymology.
One of the theories is that the name of the village comes from the stones which could be found here - Leska (). The stone is used as a decoration for the enclosures and the walls of local houses and in the past was used as a foundation for the adobe made houses. The other theory is that Leskov comes from the bulgarian word Leska () which means "hazel tree". The Bulgarian word dol is translated in English as "small valley". It is not known what is in fact the village name - "Leskov dol" or "Leskovdol", but nowadays many people have adopted the merged version. Also on most of the maps and in official documents the name is written Leskovdol.
History.
It is believed that the village appeared on the map between the years 1000 and 1300. The legend of the founding of the nearby monastery states that 7 brothers from Bessarabia settled in the mountains around the monastery and brought their families with them. One of the brothers settled in the lands of Leskovdol with his family and founded the village. This is just a legend but so far no evidence about the village's history are found.
Vetrilova vodenitsa fortress.
It is known that around the time of khan Krum on the northern hills above the village was located a fortress called Vetrilova vodenitsa. It is not known when exactly was the fortress built but it is known that it was repaired during the time of khan Krum for his march to conquer Serdica. Today on the meadows above Leskovdol, near Izdremets peak, can be found numerous scattered stones, rocks and also parts of the foundations of the fortress. Near the village also passed the ancient Roman road from Vratsa to Serdica.
Wars between 1912 - 1918.
20 people from the village perished in the wars that took place between 1912 and 1918. Their names are inscripted into a memorial plaque on one of the walls of the village church.
Nature and landscape.
The landscape is steep, typical for the Western Stara Planina region. Leskovdol is situated in the Murgash part, from 700 to 1200 meters above sea level. Forests cover a large percentage of the territory. Wide meadows can be seen mainly in the higher parts. No big rivers flow through the village although there are many small streams. All of them merge with a small river which flows into the Iskar and is called Redinska.
Area.
Today the village with all of its hamlets lies on the slopes of the Stara planina on over 26,2 square kilometers.
Flora & fauna.
The flora is dominated by oaks, elms, birches and many fruit tree species from the broad-leaved trees & pines and firs from the conifers. The flora is typical for this part of the region. The fauna in the region is represented by species of birds, bugs, mammals and reptiles typical for Stara Planina. There can also be seen, but rarely, wolves, foxes and hedgehogs. Domestic animals such as sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, cattle, cows, donkeys and honey bees can also be seen in almost every yard because local people take care of them for their products. A small part of Leskovdol's territory is under the protection of Natura 2000.
Division.
The village is divided into a number of hamlets. Some of the hamlets' names are: Klyuch, Selishteto, Kokeleni babki, Startsa, Razmeritsa, Draganov Tok, Svinareva, Livada, Ravnishteto, Popov kladenets, Ladomeritsa, Pali graditsa, Padinata, Mogilata.
Leskovdol also neighbours the village of Redina. Due to Leskovdol's closeness to Redina the houses at the beginning of the road are a part of Redina. Leskovdol starts after "Lozeto" () bus stop on the route Svoge - Leskovdol. The bus stop is named after a locality which helped the villagers determine the border between the two villages.
Education.
There is a single school - "Hristo Botev" but it shut down years ago. The local children go to the nearby town of Svoge to continue their education. The first village school was built on the banks of Redinska river but was destroyed in the 1940s. Soon after the existing school was built in Selishteto hamlet.
Culture.
Nowadays the village has no functioning schools or chitalishta. Years ago Leskovdol had a folklor ensemble which performed national dances & songs from Bulgaria and from the Svoge region. The traditions here are close to the ones typical for the Svoge and Sofia regions.
Demographics.
While under Ottoman rule Bulgaria's population mainly lived in the mountain regions in small villages. At the beginning of the 20th century the population was at least 800 people and continued to enlarge. The migration towards the cities and the lowering fertility rate are the biggest problems that kept Leskovdol from growing. Today the permanent population is 87 residents and an additional 17 people who declare to live in Leskovdol but at the moment reside in another place. (data from 15.09.2011). The unemployment is high due to the location of the village in a mountainous region. In summer a lot of people, mainly from Sofia, come to their villas for the typical summer break for adults and students.
2011 census.
According to the census held on the 01.02.2011 "114" people declared to live in the village. Only 36 from them are officially retired.
Houses.
Most of the old houses in the village were built using adobe, rocks, wood and roof tiles. In the late 1960s people from around the country bought parcels in the village's hamlets and started building a second type of houses - villas and bungalows - which they used as a residence for their summer vacations. The villas are built with modern building material and thus creating a mixed look of the village with both typical and new houses forming the background. According to the 2001 census there were 128 local houses, 26 of which abandoned, and 619 other buildings, including villas & barns.
Economy.
People from the village either work in Svoge and Sofia or take care of their own small gardens and animal farms. Woodcutters are also often seen in the higher parts of the mountain. There is a small bar and a shop next to the village hall. They are open every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Religion.
The entire population consists of Christians. There are three cemeteries - one nearby the village hall, one in Dabeto hamlet and one in the Selishteto hamlet. The church is also there. It was built during the period between the two world wars. There are no priests since the 1970s. There is also an outdoor semantron.
There are two monasteries close to Leskovdol. One is the Seven Altars Monastery and the other is the Batuliya monastery "Sveti Nikola" which is located about 20 kilometers south east from the village.
Transport.
Leskovdol can be reached from the main road Sofia - Mezdra just before entering Svoge. The only asphalt road is mostly in a good condition but only reaches the center of the village. Apart from that road all the others are dirt roads. There are two charter buses to the village from Svoge every day - one in the morning and another in the afternoon. On Thursday there is an additional bus around noon.
Infrastructure.
Almost all the houses have electricity and water supply although in the summer due to mass usage some of the houses receive lower voltage and not enough water. There are no telephone lines except a telephone post in the village hall. The postal code is 2268 and the post is delivered only to the village hall. The three Bulgarian mobile operators have complete coverage in Leskovdol. The village hall shut down in the summer of 1999 due to the continuing diminution of the population.

Golden West Farms

Golden West Farms was a Canadian Thoroughbred horse racing stable and breeding farm at Okotoks, Alberta owned by Frank McMahon and Max Bell.
Both partners were successful businessmen who invested in Thoroughbred racehorses. Frank McMahon most notably owned U.S. Racing Hall of Fame colt Majestic Prince, winner of the 1969 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Max Bell owned successful horses including the colt Meadow Court in a partnership with friend, Bing Crosby. Meadow Court raced in Europe where he won the 1965 Irish Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. 
According to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame, Golden West Farms was "by far the most elaborate thoroughbred breeding farm between Ontario and British Columbia". The operation campaigned at race tracks across Canada. In 1967 their horse Gilmore won the Canadian Derby at Edmonton's Northlands Park. Trainer Roy Johnson campaigned horses for Golden West Farms at Woodbine Racetrack during the 1960s where they won numerous stakes races including the Coronation Futurity Stakes and the 1968 Plate Trial Stakes then Canada's most prestigious horse race, the Queen's Plate. 
The partnership was dissolved on the death of Max Bell in 1972.

Tecoma capensis

Tecoma capensis (common name Cape honeysuckle) is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae, native to southern Africa. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to the true honeysuckle.
Synonyms include "Bignonia capensis", "Tecomaria capensis" and "Tecoma petersii".
Description.
An erect, scrambling shrub, it grows to in height and a similar width. Normally evergreen, it may lose its leaves in colder climates. In certain habitats it may scramble, meaning that it shoots out long growth tips which lean on the stems and branches of other plants, as well as boulders, trellises, fences and walls; this can lead to the plant appearing untidy. The leaves are up to long. They are opposite, slightly serrated, green to dark-green, and pinnate with 5 to 9 oblong leaflets.
The flowers are tubular, narrow, about long, and are produced at different times throughout the year. They are grouped in long terminal clusters. The flower colour ranges from orange to orange-red to apricot.
Distribution.
The species occurs naturally in South Africa, Swaziland and southern Mozambique. It is cultivated in other areas of the world, such as in South-east Asia and Hawaii. It can be considered invasive in remote islands such as the Acores (as seen at the island of São Miguel, near Ponta Garça).
Cultivation.
"Tecoma capensis" has been in cultivation for many years and is often used for hedging, as it is a scrambling shrub. It can be propagated from cuttings or by removing rooted suckers during the active growth phase.
It can be planted in semi-shade to full sun. In cold areas young plants should be protected from frost. To keep this shrub clean and tidy, it must be pruned back in late winter to promote new growth and flowers. The application of a balanced fertilizer after pruning will enhance the growth and flowering.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Ecology.
"Tecoma capensis" is an excellent plant to use in a wildlife garden in Southern Africa, since it is popular with sunbirds and certain insects due to its nectar. As a scrambler, it can be quite dense (if pruned) and as such can be utilised as a nesting site by a few bird species.
The larvae of the Death's Head Hawkmoth ("Acherontia atropos") and the Fulvous Hawkmoth ("Coelonia mauritii") eat the leaves of this plant.

Buckie High School

Buckie High School is a mixed secondary school in Buckie, Moray, Scotland which has a roll of around 900 pupils in years S1 to S6. The school serves the coastal communities of Portgordon, Buckie, Portessie, Findochty, Portknockie, and Cullen. Buckie High School aims to be a learning community which has a ‘can do’ ethos, and it is a place where pupils, staff, parents, and the wider community work together to make learning and teaching an enjoyable, fun experience, where everyone involved is supported, challenged, engaged and motivated.
History.
Rathven School Board.
There has been a secondary school in Buckie since 1875. The opening followed the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, which made education compulsory between the ages of 5 and 13 and put education in the charge of 895 school boards. Rathven School Board covered the Buckie area and built Buckie Public School in West Church Street, at its junction with Pringle Street. The first entry in the school’s log book on 14 January 1876 records that there were 100 pupils enrolled in the charge of a rector, and two pupil teachers. The curriculum consisted of Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar and Composition, History, Geography, Singing and Religious Knowledge, with Latin for some pupils. The Latin in the school motto translates as 'with oars and sails' - and suggests doing things with all the effort and power you can muster.
School Board records show that by 1881 Mathematics and Domestic Economy had been added to the curriculum and the roll had risen to 400, with a rector, two assistant teachers and six pupil teachers. In 1896 the school had nineteen staff and 850 pupils. The curriculum had been widened and now included Greek, French, Cookery, Industrial Work, Drawing, Military Drill, German, Science and Shorthand.
The first mention of national examinations was in 1894 when the School Log in June noted that “the Leaving Certificate Examinations interfered with work”, but in 1895 the Inspectors report noted with commendation that “there were gained 53 Leaving Certificates – 18 at the Higher Grade.”
For many years after 1876, school attendance followed a seasonal pattern depending on the herring fishing. At this time many families travelled with the fishing fleet as they followed the herring around the coast of Britain. In September 1880, for example, the school opened with 83 in attendance. In the next two weeks attendance rose to 183 and then 255, but by July it had dropped to 65. School log books refer to the herring fishing, lifting potatoes, pupils “jooking” and the problem of pupils “forgetting what they have been taught”.
Banffshire County Council.
In 1919 control of the school moved to the newly formed Banffshire County Council. By this time there had been several extensions to the original Buckie Public School building and the pupil roll was well over 1000. The School Log notes the existence of a “Supplementary Course” for pupils who did not wish to pursue academic studies and also that pupils were achieving success in the Aberdeen University Bursary Competition. The Bursary Competition was the yardstick of success at this time. Navigation was introduced to the curriculum as it was becoming important for Board of Trade examinations.
By 1921 the old school building was inadequate and it was decided to build a new secondary school, at a cost of £30,000, on its present site in West Cathcart Street. It was opened in 1927, by which time there was a staff of 36 (including seven principal teachers) and sport and music began to play an important part in the life of the school. This new stone-built building, now known as the “Old Building”, is still in use today and houses four subject departments. All primary classes, technical education and cookery remained in the original Buckie Public School building in West Church Street.
In 1937 it was decided to build a new building for the primary department for Buckie Public School immediately opposite the secondary department in West Cathcart Street. The building was, however, too small even before it opened, so classes continued to use the original building in West Church Street into the 1960s. The Banffshire education Committee decided to make the primary department a separate school in 1969. It was known as Buckie Primary School for a decade until it was renamed Cluny Primary School. 
After the Second World War the welfare state provision led to the opening of canteen facilities, provision of free books and travel when required, and to the provision of courses which, in the catch phrase of the day, “were suitable to the age, aptitude and ability of the pupil”. Ordinary and Higher Grade exams were introduced after 1962.
The raising of the school leaving age to 16 in 1972-3, and the introduction of comprehensive education, led to an urgent need to expand what was by now known as Buckie High School. Banffshire Education Committee planned to build a new tower block at Buckie High School and close the junior secondary schools in Portgordon, Buckpool (St.Peter’s), Portessie, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen.
Grampian Regional Council.
Regionalisation transferred the school to Grampian Region in 1975. Buckie High School’s “New Building” was completed in 1974 allowing it to cater for all secondary age pupils in the coastal area between Cullen and Portgordon. It was now a comprehensive school aiming to meet the needs of all pupils in the west of Banffshire. The old building in West Cathcart Street continued to be used to house the Music Department until around 1983 before its sale and conversion into flats known as 'Pringle Court'. The school became fully inclusive when Clochan Special School was integrated into the High School in 1986. Grampian identified Buckie High School as one of its six “social priority” schools following the downturn in fishing and related industries. The new Standard Grade exams were phased in during the late 1980s and Buckie High became a front runner in developing the curriculum for these new courses. A new reception and community wing was added in 1990 and the school became known locally as Buckie Community High School.
The Moray Council.
Buckie High School was transferred to The Moray Council in 1996 and is now one of eight secondary schools in the Moray area. Buckie High School's associated primary schools are Portgordon Primary school, St Peter’s Primary School, Cluny Primary School, Millbank Primary School, Portessie Primary School, Findochty Primary School, Portknockie Primary School and Cullen Primary School.
School Football.
Buckie is proud of its football teams, especially the seniors' team, as they as currently one of the most successful teams in their history. They have won back-to-back League and League Cup titles in the 2011/12 and the 2012/13 campaigns. In the current season (2013/14) the team is in the League Cup final once again, and also have one game left in the league vs Gordonstoun - which will be a title decider. In addition to all of this, they have once more reached the North of Scotland Cup final, where they hope to bring back the 'Cock of the North' trophy to Buckie High for the first time since they won it last in 1960 - when they beat Dornoch Academy 5-3 under lights at Telford Park in Inverness.
Learning and achievement.
Examination results are broadly in line with those of young people with similar needs and backgrounds in other schools. 
HMIe report that in addition to Scottish Qualifications Authority examinations, large numbers of young people are participating in a range of activities which develop skills and confidence. These include a wide range of sports, music and theatrical productions as well as regular residential and overseas visits, college courses, enterprise activities and an annual activities week. Young people's skills are recognised through a range of awards including awards from the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network (ASDAN), Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme, Sports Leadership awards, Youth Achievement awards, John Muir Awards and Dynamic Youth Awards.
Curriculum.
Courses.
School inspectors report that the school provides a very good range of courses and activities to motivate young people and meet their needs in innovative ways. As well as the full range of school-based Scottish Qualifications Authority courses, vocational courses at Moray College and Banff and Buchan College are widely used to complement the in-school curriculum. In addition, some pupils each year work towards a vocationally orientated Scottish Group Award. In 2006, pupils on this course teamed up with Springfield Properties, an Elgin based building company, to build their own house in the school grounds. Buckie High School also enriches the curriculum with a wide range of enterprise and citizenship activities including young enterprise companies, fair trade and Africa weeks, and enterprise challenges. As an Ecoschool, Buckie High has been endeavouring to tackle litter and waste, is landscaping the grounds and, with the support of the Co-op, installed solar roof panels in 2008.
To meet young people’s learning needs the school provides a distinctive range of courses at different levels for all year groups.
Working with partners.
Buckie High School has an active Parent Council which also includes pupils. The school makes innovative use of an interactive American website to extend learning into the home. The technology allows all teachers to post materials on line, while the password-protected subject message boards allow pupils to access learning materials or provide feedback from home or anywhere in the world.
Library.
Recent visitors include Catherine MacPhail, Terry Deary, Ian Rankin, Alan Bissett, Keith Gray, Catherine Forde, Anne Macleod, Liz Lochhead, Bernard MacLaverty and Liz Niven. Terry Deary’s "Horrible History of Scotland” is dedicated to the pupils of Buckie High School, after they challenged him to produce such a book.
Partnership.
Buckie High School has been building a partnership with Mawenzi Secondary School in Moshi, Tanzania since 1989. Between 1992 and 2010 there have been nineteen reciprocal visits, with a group from Tanzania due to visit in June 2011. Pupils and staff have been involved with presentations at the Commonwealth Institute, the Commonwealth Education Ministers' Conference in 2003 and the Scottish Learning Festival in 2007. Both schools recognize the need to embed global issues in the curriculum and are exploring together issues of diversity, values and perceptions, sustainability, and social justice.
Innovation and improvement.
The school achieved Investors in People status in 2004, renewed in 2007 and 2010. In 2009 HM Inspectorate noted that the school has “a strong capacity for improvement".
Buckie High School brought automated messaging to the UK in 2000 to notify parents and carers of unexplained absences. A Scottish Executive grant allowed an American system to be adapted for use in United Kingdom. The initial system used recorded voice messages to advise parents whenever their child could not be accounted for. This has been replaced by text messaging and is now widespread across the UK.
Innovative strategies have been used to help older pupils support younger ones in their learning. Based on the notion that the best way to learn something is to teach it, cross-age tutoring has been used to teach pupils specific skills. Fourth year maths classes have, for example, paired up with a second year class for pupils to teach fractions. Fifth and sixth year students have paired up with younger students to learn about HIV. This cross-age tutoring in relation to HIV has also involved teachers and pupils from Buckie High School’s partner school in Tanzania.
In 2007-2008, Music, drama and art were used to inspire better performance in Mathematics. The Scottish Arts Council provided funding to allow artists to work alongside Mathematics teachers in classrooms. Finding new ways to help pupils understand key concepts such as volume continues to be central to Scotland’s emerging Curriculum for Excellence.
Buildings.
The main school building is separated into three sections - one being the old building, one being the "new" building and one being the new Performing Arts facility, opened in 2010. The old building has two floors, the ground floor consisting of the English Department and some of the Modern Languages department.
Upstairs of the old building is mainly mathematics. However, again there are two Modern Languages classrooms. In the "new" building, there are some recreational areas on the ground floor which includes Reception, the snack bar, and the social area with vending machines. There are also the medical room, Senior Leadership Team offices and the janitors' office. In classrooms, there is P.E (connected to the swimming pool), Business Education, Art and Design, Computing/ICT and "Successmaker." On the second floor there is Home Economics, the library, the prefects' common room, History, the staff room and another Business Education classroom. Upstairs on the final floor is Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, and the Technicians' base. The brand new extension consists of two RME classrooms, three music classrooms, a suite of music practice rooms and a state-of-the-art Performance Space, with Bleacher seating for 240 people. There is also a technical block which consists of woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing rooms.

Red Queen hypothesis

The Red Queen hypothesis, also referred to as Red Queen's, Red Queen's race or The Red Queen Effect, is an evolutionary hypothesis which proposes that organisms must constantly adapt, evolve, and proliferate not merely to gain reproductive advantage, but also simply to survive while pitted against ever-evolving opposing organisms in an ever-changing environment. The Red Queen hypothesis intends to explain two different phenomena: the constant extinction rates as observed in the paleontological record caused by co-evolution between competing species and the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals. The phenomenon's name is derived from a statement that the Red Queen made to Alice in Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass" in her explanation of the nature of Looking-Glass Land:
Now, "here", you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.
The original idea of the Red Queen hypothesis was given by Leigh Van Valen in order to explain the "Law of Extinction". Leigh Van Valen showed that in many populations the probability of extinction does not depend on the lifetime of this population. In addition, the probability of extinction is constant over millions of years for a given population. This could be explained by the coevolution of species. Indeed, an adaptation in a population of one species (e.g. predators, parasites ...) may change the selection pressure on a population of another species (e.g., prey, hosts), giving rise to an antagonistic coevolution. If this occurs reciprocally, a potential dynamic coevolution may result. 
In another idea, the Red Queen hypothesis is used by Bell to explain the evolution of sex, by John Jaenike to explain the maintenance of sex and W. D. Hamilton to explain the role of sex in response to parasites. In all cases, sexual reproduction confers species variability and a faster generational response to selection by making offspring genetically unique. Sexual species are able to improve their genotype in changing conditions. Consequently co-evolutionary interactions, between host and parasite for example, may select for sexual reproduction in hosts in order to reduce the risk of infection. Oscillations in genotype frequencies are observed between parasites and hosts in an antagonistic coevolutionary way without necessitating changes to the phenotype.
Arms race.
Biological definition.
Leigh Van Valen (1973) proposed the metaphor of an evolutionary arms race which was appropriate for the description of biological processes with dynamics similar to arms races. In this processes, an adaptation in a population of one species (e.g., predators, parasites) may change the selection pressure on a population of another species (e.g., prey, host), giving rise to an antagonistic coevolution.
Interspecific arms race :
"The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner." Aesop
The emergence of concept and illustrations.
Van Valen proposed the Red Queen hypothesis as an explanatory tangent to his proposed "Law of Extinction" (also 1973), which he derived from observation of constant probabilities of extinction within families of organisms across geological time. Put differently, Van Valen found that the ability of a family of organisms to survive does not improve over time, and that the lack of correlation between age and extinction is suggestive of a random process. The Red Queen hypothesis as formulated by Van Valen provides a conceptual underpinning to discussions of evolutionary arms races, even though a direct test of the hypothesis remains elusive, particularly at the macroevolutionary level. This concept remains similar to that of a system obeying a self-organized criticality.
For example, because every improvement in one species will lead to a selective advantage for that species, variation will normally continuously lead to increases in fitness in one species or another. However, since different species tend to co-evolve, improvement in one species implies that it will get a competitive advantage over the other species, and thus be able to capture a larger share of the resources available to all. This means that fitness increase in one evolutionary system will tend to lead to fitness decrease in another system. The only way that a species involved in a competition for resources can maintain its fitness relative to other competing species is by improving its specific fitness. (From Heylighen, 2000)
The most obvious example of this effect are the "arms races" between predators and prey (e.g., Vermeij, 1987), where the only way predators can compensate for a better defense by the prey (e.g., rabbits running faster than their parents) is by developing a better offense (e.g.. foxes running faster than their parents). In this case we might consider the relative improvements (rabbits running faster than foxes or vice versa) to be also absolute improvements in fitness. (From Heylighen, 2000)
Such examples of arms races can also be applied to human conflict and can be seen as a prominent cause of conflict. According to Azar Gat, the Red Queen effect is established when two competing groups find themselves in a security dilemma. The security dilemma, resulting from defensive measures taken to improve one's security which possess inherent offensive capabilities, triggers a military arms race. This arms race, much like the example previously referenced, causes each side to consume ever increasing amounts of resources in order to outpace the other and gain an advantage. If an advantage is gained, the arms race is over and the group with more resources has won. However, typically both sides continue to match each other stride for stride, thus triggering the Red Queen effect as no matter how many resources each side invests, neither is able to gain an advantage. The situation is somewhat similar to the prisoner's dilemma. Each side cannot stop the arms race because of mutual suspicion and fears that the other group will gain a significant tactical advantage. Because of this, the Red Queen effect is a common outcome of inter-human competition and conflict.
Discussions of sex and reproduction were not part of Van Valen's Red Queen hypothesis, which addressed evolution at scales above the species level. The microevolutionary version of the Red Queen hypothesis was proposed by Bell (1982), also citing Lewis Carroll, but not citing Van Valen. See below.
The paradox of sex: The "cost" of males.
Science writer Matt Ridley popularized the term "the red queen" in connection with sexual selection in his 1993 book "The Red Queen". In the book, Ridley discussed the debate in theoretical biology over the adaptive benefit of sexual reproduction to those species in which it appears. The connection of the Red Queen to this debate arises from the fact that the traditionally accepted theory ("Vicar of Bray") only showed adaptive benefit at the level of the species or group, not at the level of the gene (although, it must be added here that the protean "Vicar of Bray" adaptation is very useful to some species that belong to the lower levels of the food chain). By contrast, a Red-Queen-type theory that organisms are running "cyclic" arms races with their parasites can explain the utility of sexual reproduction at the level of the gene by positing that the role of sex is to preserve genes that are currently disadvantageous, but that will become advantageous against the background of a likely future population of parasites.
Sex is an evolutionary puzzle. Sexual organisms must spend resources to find mates. In the case of sexual dimorphism, usually only one of the sexes contributes to the survival of their offspring. In such cases the only adaptive benefit of having another sex is the capability of sexual selection, by which organisms can improve their genotype. In this way, sexual reproduction can be highly inefficient.
Observational evidence.
Evidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for kinases and immunoglobulins in the immune system with genes coding other proteins. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.
Further evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis were provided by observing long‐term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a "mixed" (sexual and asexual) population of snails ("Potamopyrgus antipodarum"). The number of sexuals, the number of asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.
In 2011 researchers used the microscopic roundworm "Caenorhabditis elegans" as a host and the pathogenic bacteria "Serratia marcescens" to generate a host-parasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the mating system of "C. elegans", causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the "S. marcescens" parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of "C. elegans" were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis.
Historical studies.
The influence of heterogeneity in species genomes has been recognized and studied since the time of Darwin (1876) in the areas of heterosis (hybrid vigor), inbreeding and genetic deterioration, operating on the theory that lessening of the choice of gene variants and of potential cooperation among different gene types limits the capabilities of the restricted organism.
A study published in 2013 in "Science" which examined the history of groups of extinct mammals illustrates failure to adapt and evolve new species when confronted by a deteriorating environment. An interesting insight can be obtained from physical research.

Transponder timing

Transponder timing (also called chip timing or RFID timing) is a technique for measuring performance in sport events. A transponder working on a radio-frequency identification (RFID) basis is attached to the athlete and emits a unique code that is detected by radio receivers located at the strategic points in an event.
Prior to the use of this technology, races were either timed by hand (with operators pressing a stopwatch) or using video camera systems.
Transponder systems.
Generically, there are two types of transponder timing systems; active and passive. An active transponder consists of a battery-powered transceiver, connected to the athlete, that emits its unique code when it is interrogated.
A passive transponder does not contain a power source inside the transponder. Instead, the transponder captures electromagnetic energy produced by a nearby exciter and utilizes that energy to emit a unique code.
In both systems, an antenna is placed at the start, finish, and in some cases, intermediate time points and is connected to a decoder. This decoder identifies the unique transponder code and calculates the exact time when the transponder passes a timing point. Some implementations of timing systems require the use of a mat on the ground at the timing points while other systems implement the timing points with vertically oriented portals.
History.
RFID was first used in the late 1980s primarily for motor racing and became more widely adopted in athletic events in the mid-1990s on release of low cost 134 kHz transponders and readers from Texas Instruments. This technology formed the basis of electronic sports timing for the world's largest running events as well as for cycling, triathlon and skiing. Some manufacturers made improvements to the technology to handle larger numbers of transponders in the read field or improve the tolerance of their systems to low frequency noise. These low frequency systems are still used a lot today. Other manufacturers developed their own proprietary RFID systems usually as an off-shoot to more industrial applications. These latter systems attempted to get around the problem of reading large numbers of transponders in a read field by using the High Frequency 13.56 MHz RFID methodology that allowed transponders to use anti-collision algorithms to avoid tags interfering with each other's signal during the down-link between transponder and reader. Active transponder systems continued to mature and despite their much higher cost they retained market share in the high speed sports like motor racing, cycling and ice skating. Active systems are also used at high profile events such as the Olympics due to their very high read rates and time-stamping precision.
By 2005 a newer RFID technology was becoming available, mostly for industrial applications. The first and second generation (UHF) transponders and readers that were being developed followed a strict protocol to ensure that multiple transponders and readers could be used between manufacturers. Much like the HF tags, the UHF tags were much cheaper to produce in volume and formed the basis in the next revolution in sports timing. Currently many of the largest athletic events are timed using disposable transponders either placed on the back of a race number or on the runners shoe. The low cost meant that transponders were now fully disposable and did not need to be returned to the organizers after the event.
Usage.
Very large running events (more than 10,000) and triathlons were the first events to be transponder (or chip) timed because it is near impossible to manually time them. Also for large runs there are delays in participants reaching the start line, which penalize their performance. Some races place antennas or timing mats at both the start line and the finish line, which allow the exact net time to be calculated. Awards in a race are generally based on the "gun time" (which ignores any delay at the start) as per IAAF and USA Track and Field rules. However, some races use "net time" for presenting age group awards.
In the past the transponder was almost always worn on the athletes running shoe, or on an ankle band. This enabled the transponder to be read best on antenna mats because the distance between the transponder and readers antenna is minimized offering the best capture rate. Transponders may be threaded onto the shoe laces for running. For triathlon a soft elastic ankle band holds the transponder to the leg and care is taken to ensure the transponder is in the correct orientation or polarity for maximum read performance. Transponders have also been placed on the race bib, particularly with the Innovative Timing Systems Jaguar and DAG Systems (passive system) as well as J-Chip (active system). In the past 5 years the newer UHF systems use transponders placed on the shoe lace, or stuck to the race number bib. In both cases, care must be taken to ensure the UHF tag does not directly touch a large part of the skin as this affects read performance. Despite this, UHF Systems have read performances as good (if not better) than the conventional low and high frequency systems. Because these UHF tags are made in huge volumes for industrial applications, their price is much lower than that of conventional re-usable transponders and the race does not bother to collect them afterwards.
All RFID timing systems incorporate a box housing the reader(s) with peripherals like a microprocessor, serial or ethernet communications and power source (battery). The readers are attached to one or more antennas that are designed for the particular operating frequency. In the case of low or medium frequencies these consist of wire loops incorporated into mats that cover the entire width of the timing point. For UHF systems the antennas consist of patch antennas that are protected in a matting system. The patch antennas may also be placed on stands or a finish gantry pointing towards the oncoming athlete. In most cases the distance between reader and antennas is restricted. Also more equipment is needed for events that require multiple timing points. Wider timing points require more readers and antennas. For active systems a simple wire loop is all that is needed since the transponder has its own power source and the loop serves as a trigger to turn on the transponder, then receive the relatively strong signal from the transponder. Therefore active systems need less readers (or decoders) per timing point width.
All systems utilize specialised software to calculate results and splits. This software usually resides on a separate PC computer that is connected to the readers via serial or ethernet communications. The software relates the raw transponder code and timestamp data to each entrant in a database and calculates gun and net times of runners, or the splits of a triathlete. In advanced systems these results are instantly calculated and published to the internet so that athletes and spectators have access to results via any web enabled device.

Earth Intruders

"Earth Intruders" is a song written and recorded by Icelandic singer Björk. The song was released as the first single from her seventh full-length studio album, "Volta". The single was released digitally in the USA on 9 April and 21 April 2007 and in Europe on 28 April 2007. It is produced by R&B record producer Timbaland and his protégé Danja. The single was released in a physical box set on 4 February 2008. Due to high digital download sales, it remains Björk's highest charting single in the United States to date. Congolese group Konono Nº1 play electric likembes on the song.
Background.
The first mention of "Earth Intruders" as a song title was made on allaccess.com on March 10, 2007, and was later confirmed as the lead single through an article in The Guardian on March 11, 2007. On March 26, 2007, a distorted sample of the song was uploaded to the YouTube video sharing website as part of the viral marketing campaign for the "Volta" album. A fifteen second sample of the track then appeared on the Rhino Records online ringtone website on April 1, 2007. The purchased ringtone featured a different clip (with different lyrics) to the one used in the online preview on the site; both audio samples were subsequently spread across music forums. On April 3, 2007 it was reported that the Björk section of the Rhino Records online ringtone store had been removed. After a broadcast of the song on the internet radio station WOXY on April 6, 2007 the song was made widely available across file-sharing networks.
On April 7, 2007, the "Mark Stent Extended Edit" was released on the Australian iTunes Store; most other iTunes Stores made the single available on April 9, the official release date of the digital single. The album version of Earth Intruders (which differs from the iTunes Store version both in terms of mixing and track length) was leaked to the internet on April 24, 2007 due to the full album being made available accidentally on the UK iTunes Store on April 23, 2007 for a total of six hours, two weeks before the album's official release date.
In an interview on mtv.com Björk talked about the background of the song.
Critical reception.
"Earth Intruders" got favourable reception by music critics. Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Diver gave the song 9/10, praising it as "immediately catchy, compellingly left of centre, and undeniably unique". Digital Spy reviewer Miriam Zendle cited "Earth Intruders" as returning to Björk's earlier commercial sound, comparing it to her more recent albums that were "incredibly difficult to grasp hold of". Music website Popjustice called it the 80th greatest single of 2007.
Music video.
The music video for "Earth Intruders" was directed by Michel Ocelot and is his first for Björk, or indeed anyone else. It features Björk's face floating in the background, first upside down, then upright, singing with her eyes closed. In the foreground, a large group of silhouetted tribal warriors dance in time to the music. The video features psychedelic colours and patterns imposed on an earthy backdrop. The video ends with Björk's face slowly fading into the middle of a glade, her eyes being opened just as she sings the last lyric. Ocelot stated that Björk had originally wanted Kirikou (the child-hero of Ocelot's "Kirikou and the Sorceress" and "Kirikou et les bêtes sauvages") to be featured as a 20 year-old in the video. It was accomplished within strict time constraints through a combination of live-action, silhouette animation, 3D computer graphics, traditional animation, cut-outs and other special effects. "Kirikou" was danced by Legrand Bemba-Debert in a costume made, based on Ocelot's ideas, by paper sculptor Anne-Lise Kœhler.
An exclusive preview was shown during "Le Grand journal" show on French TV channel Canal+ on 17 April 2007. The full video was made available in the iTunes Store on April 24, 2007. It is also viewable on Björk's official MySpace page and included in letterboxed 576p "PAL" format on both the "Earth Intruders" and "Les Trésors cachés de Michel Ocelot" DVD-Videos and in 480-line, "NTSC" format in the "Voltaïc" box set. It was nominated for the 2007 Q Award for Best Video.
Club Mixes EP.
A digital-only "Earth Intruders – Club Mixes" EP was released on the iTunes Store in the US/UK on May 21, 2007. The European iTunes release contained only three of the original five tracks. It is only the second time (the first being Play Dead) that an instrumental of a Björk track has been officially released. With this release, it was determined that "Earth Intruders" would have no physical release in any territory worldwide. Also, the Mark Stent mix was initially labelled as an "Extended Edit", but on May 23, 2007, was retitled to "Radio Edit"; the "xxxChange Mix" was retitled from the previous non-descriptive title "Earth Intruders Remix".
The European iTunes Store release omitted the tracks "Mark Stent Radio Edit" and "Lexx Edit."
Limited edition release.
A limited edition "multiformat" box set was released at the beginning of February 2008 with slightly different artwork. The box set consists of a sticker-sealed fold out box with five nesting boxes containing two 12" vinyl singles, a CD and a DVD in colored paper sleeves.
Performances.
On April 21, 2007, a barefooted Björk appeared as musical guest on an episode of the U.S. comedy-variety show "Saturday Night Live" in promotion of the album. She performed the songs "Earth Intruders" and "Wanderlust." On June 8, 2007 (recorded on June 5, 2007), Björk performed, along with her tour musicians, on the UK television show "Later With Jools Holland" for the fifth time in her solo career. She performed "Earth Intruders," "The Anchor Song," and "Declare Independence." Björk has also performed the song on every show of the worldwide Volta Tour, usually as the very first song played after she enters the stage. Björk's set at Glastonbury Festival was broadcast on BBC Four on 22 June 2007, with "Earth Intruders" being the first song of the concert.
Charts.
"Earth Intruders" reached number 67 on the UK Official Download Chart, while the remix EP later released charted on its own at #150. In the United States, the song debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 84 in the issue dated April 28, 2007. This is Björk's highest position on the U.S. Hot 100, the previous being "Big Time Sensuality" in 1993, which peaked at number 88. The single's very modest success on the U.S. charts has been mainly attributed to internet downloads; the single sold 16,000 downloads on the week of its release, propelling it to number 65 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Digital Tracks. The song also peaked at number 75 on the U.S. Billboard Pop 100.

John Dominici

The Blessed John Dominici, O.P., (1356 – 10 June 1419) was an Italian Dominican friar who became a Cardinal, statesman and writer. His ideas had a profound influence on the art of Fra Angelico, who entered the Order through him.
Life.
Dominici was born in Florence in 1356 to very poor, but devout, parents. Growing up, he would spend hours each day in the Dominican Church of Santa Maria Novella. Not surprisingly, at the age of 17 he sought admission to the Order. He suffered, however, from a severe speech impediment, which, combined with a lack of formal education, made the friars doubt the validity of his vocation to their Order. They refused him admission repeatedly over the course of two years, even insisting that he should stay home to care for his parents, while his parents insisted that they did not want to stand in the way of his religious calling.
He was then accepted and began his novitiate with the friars there. To their surprise, they sound found that he had a sharp mind, with a good grasp of the complexities of theology and philosophy, so much so that he was sent to the University of Paris to further his studies. On his return from Paris, when he completed his theological studies in 1372, his speech impediment finally became the problem which the authorities of the Order had feared. Preaching was an expected part of each friar's life, and clearly this would be a problem for this particular friar. John sought the intercession of the holy Dominican tertiary, St. Catherine of Siena, who had recently died, and he was miraculously cured of his disability. He was then appointed professor and preacher, a post he held for twelve years at Venice.
In 1392 John was appoint Vicar Provincial of the Roman Province. It was a time of disorder for Order, which had suffered major losses in membership through a great plague. (The priory in Venice alone, e.g., had lost 77 friars in a matter of months.) With the authorization of the Master General, Raymond of Capua, John established priories of strict observance of the Order at Venice (1394) and Fiesole (1406). It was in the latter that the talented artists and brothers, John and Benedict, entered the Order, John going on to be known in history as Fra Angelico. Dominici also founded the Monastery of Corpus Domini (Venice) at Venice for the Dominican nuns of the Strict Observance; a contemporary account of his life was found in the chronicle and necrology of that monastery by Bartolomea Riccoboni.
John was sent as the envoy of Venice to the papal conclave of 1406 in which Pope Gregory XII was elected. The following year the pope, whose confessor and counsellor he had become, appointed him Archbishop of Ragusa, created him cardinal in 1408 and sent him as ambassador to Hungary, to secure the adhesion of Sigismund to the pope.
At the Council of Constance Dominici read the voluntary resignation which Gregory XII had adopted, on his advice, as the surest means of ending the Great Schism which had arisen to divide Western Christianity. At that point he resigned his cardinalate, to make clear to all that he had no desire to advance through his accomplishment. Pope Martin V appointed him papal legate to Bohemia on 19 July 1418, but he accomplished little with the followers of John Hus, owing to the timidity of King Wenceslaus IV.
Dominici died at Buda in 1419, and he was buried in the Church of St. Paul the Hermit in that city. His tomb became a site of miracles and his remains were venerated until the church was destroyed during a Turkish invasion of the country. John was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI in 1837 and his feast day is observed on 10 June in the Dominican Order.
Works.
Dominici was not only a prolific writer on spiritual subjects but also a graceful poet, as his many vernacular hymns, or "Laudi," show. His "Regola del governo di cura familiare", written between 1400 and 1405, is a pedagogical work which treats, in four books, of the faculties of the soul, the powers and senses of the body, the uses of earthly goods, and the education of children. .
His "Lucula Noctis", in reply to a letter of Nicola di Piero Salutati, is the most important treatise of that day on the study of the pagan authors. Dominici did not completely condemn classical studies. He did however express very strong criticism of some humanist tendencies, such as the use of rhetoric in politics and the rise of the professional politician.

Its religious faith is Buddhism and some Buddhist practice are carried out during the school day. Because of this, the school calendar also has extra religious holidays such as the birthday of the Buddha. Other schools on this day will only have one day off (public holiday) whereas BCWKPS will have five days off (three extra days excluding public holidays).
History.
BCWKPS was first known as the (). It was established by the Hong Kong Buddhist Association after the Second World War to provide free primary education for children. In 1968, the government planned to reclaim the land on which it was located for commercial development. In compensation, the government gave the school a piece of land on the Wah Fu Estate for a new building. It was then renamde the Buddhist Chung Wah Primary School (), which opened in 1970. In 1986, the school saw a fall in the number of students in the area and the government planned to open a language school in place of the school. After discussion between the Hong Kong Buddhist Association and the Education Department (Now the Education and Manpower Bureau), the government agreed to give another piece of land on the newly developed housing area of Kornhill in exchange for the existing land and the school building. It was renamed again to its current name by adding "Kornhill" to it and reopened in the same year.

Raymond of Capua

The Blessed Raymond of Capua, O.P., (ca. 1330 – 5 October 1399) was a leading member of the Dominican Order and served as its Master General from 1380 until his death. He was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1899. First as Prior Provincial of Lombardy and then as Master General of the Order, Raymond undertook the restoration of Dominican religious life. For his success in this endeavor, he is referred to as its "second founder".
Raymond worked also for the return of the papacy to Rome and for a solution to the Western schism. The noted mystic, St. Catherine of Siena, accepted him as a spiritual director because of his burning passion for the Church and for the revival of the religious life.
Life.
He was born Raymond della Vigna about 1330 in Capua, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, a member of a prominent family of that city, and was a descendant of Pietro della Vigna, remembered in Dante's "Divine Comedy". In 1350, while a student of law at the University of Bologna, he entered the Dominican Order. For the next twenty-five years he worked as a spiritual director or as a teacher in various communities of the Order. 
Raymond was first assigned to Montepulciano, where he served as a chaplain to a monastery of nuns of the Dominican Second Order. He was the first biographer of their venerated former prioress, Mother Agnes, who had died about fifty years earlier. He was then stationed in Rome, to serve as the prior of the friars at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Later he was sent to Siena, where he was assigned by the Master General to be the spiritual director and confessor to the noted Dominican tertiary, Catherine of Siena. Apparently this was a task which he accepted with less than enthusiasm, as he had doubts about her. 
Raymond spent the next six years advising and hearing her confidences. While there, Raymond gradually learned to trust her holiness and her judgment. This was sealed when he became involved in nursing victims of a plague of 1374. When he contracted the disease himself and lay near death, Catherine came and sat at his bedside until he recovered. Knowing how close he was to death, Raymond credited his recovery to her prayers.
By 1374 Raymond had come to the attention of Pope Gregory XI, then living in Avignon in France, from his connection to Catherine, and also for his novel ways of confronting issues like the Crusades in the Holy Land, the return of the papacy to Rome, and the general reform of the Church. He was well known for his ability to pass seamlessly from dealing with spiritual and supernatural considerations to the more mundane matters of practical politics. For four years Raymond accompanied Catherine in her journeys, and went to Avignon to act as an intermediary between her and the pope. Catherine had such faith in the commitment of the pope to the cause of a Crusade, that she sent a personal letter to the infamous English pirate, John Hawkwood, asking him to re-direct his efforts to the service of God in this cause. 
Pope Gregory would finally return to Rome in 1377, but he died in 1378. The refusal of the French cardinals to accept the election of his successor, Pope Urban VI, led to the Great Western schism that lasted 39 years, with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon. This schism divided Europe. Raymond, like Catherine, supported the Roman papacy and defended its legitimacy.
In 1379 by command of Pope Urban VI Raymond was examined by Fra. Giacomo Altoviti who promoted him to the grade of Master of Theology. 
In the year 1380, Catherine died and Raymond was elected Master General of Dominican Order. He then divided his time between Italy and Germany. In the Caterinian spirit of reform, he gave a new spiritual vitality to the Order. Raymond favored the development of a new interpretation of "observance", for which he drew upon the Franciscan example. In this work he gained the designation of being the second founder of the Order of the Preachers.
Veneration.
Raymond was buried first in Nuremberg (now Germany) where he died, but his body was later moved to Naples, to the Church of San Domenico Maggiore. In 1899 Pope Leo XIII beatified him on the 500th anniversary of his death.

Lublin Voivodeship (1919–39)

Lublin Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division of the Second Polish Republic, in the years 1919–1939. Its capital and biggest city was Lublin.
Location and area.
In the years 1919–1939, Lublin Voivodeship covered central part of Poland, the heartland of the country, bordering Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939) to the north, Warsaw Voivodeship and Kielce Voivodeship to the west, Lwów Voivodeship to the south and Polesie Voivodeship as well as Volhynian Voivodeship to the east. Its area, after April 1, 1938 (see: Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on April 1, 1938) was 26,555 km². Landscape was flat and hilly in the south, forests covered only 16.6% of the area (with nation's average of 22.2%, as for January 1, 1937).

Lotte Lehmann Foundation

The Lotte Lehmann Foundation, named for the great German soprano active in the first half of the 20th century, served to preserve and perpetuate her legacy, and to honor her dream of bringing art song into the lives of as many people as possible.
Gary Hickling, the founder of the Lehmann Foundation, met Lehmann in the early sixties, observing first the private lessons she gave at Orplid, her home in Santa Barbara, and later, her master classes at the Music Academy of the West, which she helped found in 1947. Hickling became a noted expert on Lehmann’s career and work, compiling a Lehmann discography in 1987. He continued to compile and collect material and memorabilia relating to Lehmann’s career, which now forms a significant part of the Lotte Lehmann Archive in Santa Barbara. The Foundation’s precursor, the Lotte Lehmann League, published a newsletter from 1989-1994. The League has since 2011 been re-established, with only a website: www.lottelehmannleague.org. The Lotte Lehmann League website provides an in-depth look at Lehmann's career and includes extensive material on art song.
In the early years of its existence, Hickling was solely responsible for maintaining the Foundation, operations of which were transferred from Hawaii to New York City in 2003. The composer Daron Hagen was chosen as the newly configured Foundation’s president, and an entirely new Board of Directors was chosen at that time. Mezzo soprano Linn Maxwell was elected president in 2007. Since 2010 Larry Smith has been president. Hickling retired from the Foundation in 2005 and remains an emeritus member of the Board of Directors.
The Lehmann Foundation was a respected non-profit musical foundation in the United States. Its activities included two competitions, the first of which, the internet-based CyberSing vocal competition occurred every two years and solicited recordings from singers the world over.
The ASCAP/Lotte Lehmann Foundation Song Cycle Competition, which occurred in alternating years with CyberSing, solicited compositions by young composers resident in or native of the United States; winners received commissions to compose individual songs or, in the case of the First Prize recipient, a song cycle.
VoxNova Media comprised another aspect of the Foundation’s activities. The mission of this division was to produce media in a variety of forms, including audio recordings, video recordings, printed materials. VNM plan was to reissue historical audio recordings by Lehmann and her colleagues, present new recordings of contemporary vocal repertoire and of the vocal art of contemporary interpreters.
In addition to these programs and activities, the Foundation presented an annual World of Song Award which alternated among composers, singers, and collaborative pianists and served to recognize those who have devoted their creative lives to this enriching form of music. Its most recent recipient is John Wustman, the distinguished American collaborative pianist and educator; previous recipients include composers Dominick Argento and Ned Rorem, tenor Hugues Cuénod, mezzo soprano Janet Baker, and baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. The Foundation has ceased activities.
A full description of the Foundation, its Board Members and its various programs, as well as archival material on Lotte Lehmann herself, is available on the Foundation’s website.

Teenagers (song)

"Teenagers" is the fourth single and the eleventh track from My Chemical Romance's third studio album, "The Black Parade". It is the third U.S. single from the album, but it is the fourth single released in the UK, the Philippines, Australia and Canada. This song is the band's eleventh overall single.
Background.
Gerard Way is quoted as saying that he wrote the song after finding himself in a New York subway car full of high schoolers: "That was the first time I felt old...I was nervous and I was a target. I felt like I had become a parent figure or part of the problem." 
About the relationship between the song and concerns about gun violence, Way said:
This song was #25 on "Rolling Stone"'s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. This song was also #80 on "MTV Asia"'s list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.
The single is certified Platinum by the RIAA.
Promotion.
It was made available for download for the Xbox 360's "Guitar Hero II" game on August 15, 2007, along with "Famous Last Words", and "This Is How I Disappear", adding to their song shipped with the game, "Dead!". It was also made available for download with full guitar, drum, bass, and vocals charts for "".
Music video.
The music video opens with an almost shot-for-shot tribute to the first scene of Pink Floyd's film "The Wall". Further links to "The Wall" are seen when cheerleaders don gas masks similar to those worn by the teenaged and young adult fans in the film.
The video was posted by the band via their YouTube channel on May 30, 2007 and has since obtained over 78 million views. Sometime around November 1, 2007, the video passed the "Famous Last Words" video as the third most played video on the site. This version of the video cut out the word "shit". The MTV version differs from the YouTube version; notably the teenagers breaking in was cut out, as well as the words "gun", "shit", and "murder". The video has debuted on "Total Request Live".
This video made its world premiere in New Zealand, which was also the first country in which "The Black Parade" reached number one. Multiple pirated versions of the video surfaced on the internet days before the American debut.
The music video version of the song (directed by Marc Webb) seems to have some added audio. During and onwards the lyrics "They say all teenagers scare the living shit out of me", there are piano notes playing in the background in the style of western music (during live performances, the piano plays along to the music even more so). The album version of the song does not have this piano playing until the coda.
Reception.
My Chemical Romance surprised many critics by the musical style of "Teenagers". It incorporates elements of pop punk, hard rock and 12 bar blues. This earned them mostly positive reviews from critics. A reviewer from NME Magazine wrote, "Some bands go out of their way to do a song with a sound they're never bound to do, then release it as a single. They usually fail. My Chemical Romance tried a substantially different sound for this song, and it paid off. The message is simple, the chorus is catchy and Ray Toro's solo joins the chorus and bridge together so smoothly." The song managed to grab 5 stars in both NME and AbsolutePunk.net as well as 4/5 from IMDb.
In other media.
The video for "Teenagers" can be seen and heard on the television in one scene of the television series "Bionic Woman", in the episode "Do Not Disturb". This song is also featured in an episode of "Dog The Bounty Hunter", the 2008 film "Never Back Down", and an episode of "LA Ink", in which tattoo artist Kat Von D tattoos Frank Iero. The main riff of the single was featured in the seventh episode of "Dirty Sexy Money"' "The Wedding". It is also included on the "Saints Row 2" soundtrack.
Track listing.
Version 1 (promotional CD)
Version 2 (CD and 7" vinyl)

Charts.
The song entered the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at #2, before debuting at #87 on the Hot 100 the following week as the "Hot Shot" debut of the week, and has peaked at #67. It has reached #23 on the Pop 100, and #13 on Modern Rock Tracks. It has also debuted at #42 in the UK, and has gone onto become the band's fourth straight top 20 hit from "The Black Parade" and their third top ten hit from the album, peaking at #9. It debuted at number 16 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

<doc id="9918266" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9918266" title="Euthyroid sick syndrome">
Euthyroid sick syndrome

Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS), sick euthyroid syndrome (SES), non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) or low T3 low T4 syndrome is a state of adaptation or dysregulation of thyrotropic feedback control where the levels of T3 and/or T4 are at unusual levels, but the thyroid gland does not appear to be dysfunctional. This condition is often seen in starvation, critical illness or patients in intensive care unit. The most common hormone pattern in sick euthyroid syndrome is a low total and unbound T3 levels with normal T4 and TSH levels.
Causes.
Causes of euthyroid sick syndrome include a number of acute and chronic conditions, including pneumonia, fasting, starvation, anorexia nervosa, sepsis, trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass, malignancy, stress, heart failure, hypothermia, myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Euthyroid sick syndrome (non-thyroidal illness syndrome) has been assumed closely related with a series of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease.
Diagnosis.
Affected patients may have normal, low, or slightly elevated TSH depending on the spectrum of illness. Total T4 and T3 levels may be altered by binding protein abnormalities, and medications. Reverse T3 levels are generally increased signifying inhibition of normal Type 1 enzyme or reduced clearance of reverse T3. Generally the levels of Free T3 will be lowered, followed by the lowering of Free T4 in relation to severity of the disease. Patients might have high corticosteroid level.
Therapy.
Several trials investigated a possible therapy of ESS. However, they yielded inconsistent and partly contradictory results. This may be caused in the fact that the investigated populations were too heterogeneous in the lack of a consistent definition of "non-thyroid illness syndrome.".

Polyiodide

The polyiodides are a class of polyhalogen anions composed of entirely iodine atoms. The most common and simplest member is the triiodide ion, I3−. Other known, larger polyiodides include [I5-, [I82-, [I102-, [I11-, [I133-, [I224-, [I264-, and [I293-.
Preparation.
The polyiodides can be made by addition of stoichiometric amounts of I2 to solutions containing I− and I3−, with the presence of large counter-cations to stabilize them. For example, KI3•H2O can be crystallized from a saturated solution of KI when a stoichiometric amount of I2 is added and cooled.
Structure.
Polyiodides are characterized by their highly complex and variable structures, and can be considered as associations of I2, I−, and I3− units. Discrete polyiodides are usually linear, reflecting the origin of the ion. The more complex two- or three-dimensional network structures of chains and cages are formed as the ions interact with each other, with their shapes depend on their associated cations quite strongly. The table below lists the polyiodide salts which have been structurally characterized, along with their counter-cation.

Maiwand Lion

The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1886 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.
The inscription on the plinth reads as follows:
This monument records the names and commemorates the valour and devotion of XI (11) officers and CCCXVIII (318) non-commissioned officers and men of the LXVI (66th) Berkshire Regiment who gave their lives for their country at Girishk Maiwand and Kandahar and during the Afghan Campaign MDCCCLXXIX (1879) - MDCCCLXXX (1880)."History does not afford any grander or finer instance of gallantry and devotion to Queen and country than that displayed by the LXVI Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand on the XXVII (27th) July MDCCCLXXX (1880)."Despatch of General Primrose.
The regiment lost approximately 258 men out of 500 (reports of the number vary) at the battle of Maiwand, having faced an Afghan army ten times larger than the British contingent. Eleven of the men, protecting the colours, made such a brave stand before their deaths that the Afghans who fought them reported it with great respect. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his character Doctor Watson on the regiment's Medical officer, Surgeon Major A F Preston who was injured in battle.
The sculptor was George Blackall Simonds, a member of a Reading brewing family from Simonds' Brewery. The sculpture took two years to design and complete, and the lion is one of the world's largest cast iron statues. Rumours persist that Simonds committed suicide on learning that the lion's gait was incorrectly that of a domestic cat. In fact, he made careful observations on lions and the stance was anatomically correct despite various African ex-pats disagreeing. He also lived for another 43 years, enjoying continuing success as a sculptor going on to create a statue of Queen Victoria (1887) and a statue of George Palmer (1891). He retired from sculpting in 1903 and worked in the family business eventually becoming its chairman in 1910. In 1922 he temporarily came out of retirement to build the Bradfield war memorial which commemorated the deaths in the First World War of those in the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers which included his son.
The Maiwand Lion features on the front page of one of the local newspapers, the Reading Post, and also on the Reading Football Club crest.
The statue is made of cast iron, weighing 16 tons, cast by H. Young & Co. of Pimlico in 1886. It is supported on a terracotta pedestal. The rectangular pilastered plinth carries tablets recording the names of the dead, together with inscription above. The whole is listed grade II by English Heritage.

Ontario Highway 39

King's Highway 39, commonly referred to as Highway 39, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The -long route connected Highway 3 in downtown Windsor with Highway 2 south of Belle River, travelling along the southern shoreline of Lake St. Clair. Highway 39 was established in 1934. In 1961, the Pike Creek Bypass was opened and Highway 39 was rerouted along it. However, the entire route was renumbered as Highway 2 in 1970, retiring the designation from the provincial highway system. Highway 2 was itself decommissioned along the former route of Highway 39 on January 1, 1998 and transferred to Essex County and the City of Windsor. It was subsequently redesignated as Essex County Road 22.
Route description.
Highway 39 began in downtown Windsor at the intersection of Outlette Avenue and Riverside Drive, which was also the terminus of Highway 3B, Highway 18 and Highway 98. Highway 3B, Highway 98 as well as Highway 2 (which continued along Riverside Drive to the Ambassador Bridge) travelled concurrently south along Outlette Avenue to Tecumseh Boulevard. There, the designations split, with Highway 3B branching west and the others branching east. At Howard Avenue, Highway 2 and Highway 98 branched south, while Highway 39 continued east along Tecumseh Boulevard out of Windsor. At Banwell Road, Highway 39 jogged south from Tecumseh Boulevard to the Pike Creek Bypass, now Essex County Road 22, which it gently curved east onto. It followed that modern route south of Pike Creek, through Puce and Belle River, then curved south to end at Highway 2
History.
Reroutings.
The road originally travelled along what is now Essex County Road 2 (Tecumseh Road), where it led straight into Windsor along today's Tecumseh Road.
In 1961, the two-lane limited-access Pike Creek Bypass was created (and would eventually link up with the E.C. Row Expressway once it was built), that allowed traffic to avoid travelling down the busy County Road 2 (Tecumseh Road) between Puce and Tecumseh. Highway 39 was then re-routed along the new Pike Creek Bypass, deleting the other roads as provincial highways.
The new routing of the road led it along its old path towards Puce, but then diverged along the Pike Creek Bypass towards Manning Road (Essex CR 19). It then turned right (north) for around 2 km, where it met up with Tecumseh Road (CR 2, its old alignment) in Tecumseh. It then turned left and travelled along Tecumseh Road, to its terminus with Highway 3B (Oullette Avenue).
In 1970, Highway 2 was re-aligned along its path, eliminating Highway 39 from the system. Highway 2 would be decommissioned in 1998, however, and redesignated as Essex County Road 22.
Aside from a brief segment east from Manning Road for about 1 km, the road is entirely 2-lanes and without store and house accesses (it was built as a two-lane expressway and only has access at intersections, with no adjacent properties or driveways).
Due to the huge housing boom in western Lakeshore, the road has become extremely congested, and many people have desired the road be widened to four lanes, or even a divided highway or freeway, but due to the narrow right of way, the road is being widened to four lanes as a new Super-Arterial road or even a Super 4, with the possibility of an interchange at Manning Road.
In 1970, Highway 2 was re-routed along all of Highway 39's path, thus deleting it. The Pike Creek Bypass was still in provincial control (as Highway 2) until 1998, when it, too was deleted. It is now known as Essex County Road 22.

Matt Sanchez

Matt Sanchez (born December 1, 1970) is a journalist, who has worked for Fox News and other organizations. He previously served as a Marine reservist. and was involved in a controversy about access to campus for military recruiters at Columbia University. In March 2007, Sanchez was awarded the first "Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award" at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In the early 90s, Sanchez performed in gay pornographic films as Pierre LaBranche and Rod Majors. He was involved in the Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy, as a source.
Marine Corps service and inquiries.
In 2003, Sanchez joined the United States Marine Corps and was trained as a refrigeration mechanic with the rank of corporal.
On March 16, 2007, John Hoellwarth, a staff writer for Military Times Media Group, reported that Sanchez was the subject of a Marine Corps inquiry about his appearances in gay pornographic videos and related allegations.
Of concern was whether "Sanchez had enlisted prior to the end of his film career," "if Reserve Marines were prohibited from doing porn when not in a drilling status," and "how the current 'don't ask, don't tell' policy might apply."
In an article published April 1, 2007 by the "Marine Corps Times", Hoellwarth wrote that the Marine Corps was also investigating reports that Sanchez had "wrongfully solicited funds to support purported deployment to Iraq." According to the article, a Marine investigator accused Sanchez of "coordinating a $300 payment from the New York City United War Veterans Council and $12,000 from U-Haul."
Sanchez told the newspaper that the charges were "demonstrably false," and that he never collected any funds from the listed organizations.
Political activism at Columbia University.
In 2005, while a junior at the Columbia University School of General Studies,
Sanchez said he was harassed by students during the Fall 2005 "Activities Day" while manning the table for the Columbia Military Society. According to Sanchez, he was approached by members of the International Socialist Organization, an anti-war campus group who told him he was stupid for serving in the military. According to Mark Xue, president of the military society who was at the table with Sanchez, "They were telling him that he was stupid and ignorant, that he was being brainwashed and used for being a minority in the military."
Sanchez made a series of formal complaints to the university, which upon investigation found no grounds for punishing the three accused students.
The accused dispute Sanchez's account of the events. In a "Columbia Daily Spectator" editorial, "The Conservative Witch Hunt," Zach Zill wrote that while he did make clear that he found on-campus military recruitment offensive, he had done so without the use of epithets and derogatory language.
Monique Dols, another of the accused Socialists, stated the complaint was false and "a discrediting campaign against us."
Sanchez and others in the student group MilVets, an organization for on-campus veterans, had also voiced their frustration at what they perceived to be a lack of regard for veterans on the campus. In February 2006, the university amended its non-discrimination policy to include "military status" for protection from harassment. According to the University, this was not a policy change, but merely a "semantic clarification," as the words "military status" replaced "disabled or Vietnam era veteran."
Media coverage and CPAC.
On December 4, 2006, Sanchez wrote an opinion piece for the "New York Post", titled,
"Diversity Double-Talk: Ivy's 'Inclusion' excludes Military," which led to his being invited onto various conservative talk shows in January 2007 to discuss the incident.
On March 2, 2007, Sanchez was awarded the Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A featured speaker at the conference, Ann Coulter, made controversial remarks at the event, indirectly referring to presidential candidate John Edwards as a "faggot". In an article for "Salon.com", Sanchez discussed how a photograph of him taken at the conference with Coulter brought him to the attention of bloggers, one of whom recognized him as a former pornographic gay film star. In the same article, Sanchez stated that bloggers had compared him to Rich Merritt, author of "Secrets of a Gay Marine Porn Star", and Jeff Gannon, a conservative journalist who was outed as a gay escort.
Commentary.
Matt Sanchez provided commentary and reports for WorldNetDaily
and Foxnews.com, including as an embedded reporter in Afghanistan. His work has appeared in the National Review Online, "The Weekly Standard", and "Human Events".
Sanchez was a source associated with criticism of Scott Beauchamp's "Baghdad Diarist" writings which appeared in "The New Republic".
The story became nationally known when military bloggers (milbloggers) and "Weekly Standard" editor Michael Goldfarb raised doubt about the validity of the reports of the "Baghdad Diarist".
Selected filmography.
In the early 1990s, Sanchez performed in gay pornographic movies, appearing as Pierre La Branche and Rod Majors. However, in a 2007 interview, Sanchez commented that "I don't like porn, it reduces the mind, flattens the soul" and that he considers his pornographic career an identity outgrown.

Junge Roemer

Junge Roemer (Young Romans) is the second album by Austrian pop rock artist Falco, released in 1984.
Production and success.
The album was a #1 hit in his native Austria. The title track was a hit single there as well as in Switzerland, and most notably in Spain, where it peaked at #2. Still, the project was considered a relative disappointment compared with the international number one success of the breakthrough hit single from his previous album, "Der Kommissar". This inspired him to change producers and incorporate more English phrases for titles and choruses, which resulted in a trio of worldwide hits two years later with "Rock Me Amadeus", "Vienna Calling" and "Jeanny".
While the phrase in the German language is correctly written "Junge Römer", the title of Falco's album and single in both German and English pressings is "Junge Roemer".

Llantarnam Abbey

Llantarnam Abbey is an abbey of the Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy and a former Cistercian monastery located in Llantarnam, Cwmbran in the county borough of Torfaen in southeast Wales. 
History.
It was founded as a daughter house of Strata Florida Abbey, Ceredigion, in 1179. After its dissolution in 1558, it was used as a private residence, being initially acquired and rebuilt by a local landowner. William Morgan of Llantarnam (Lanternam in some old documents) bought the abbey in 1561 and the family became great landowners in Monmouthshire around this time. 
The Morgans and the Earls of Worcester at Raglan became leaders of the Monmouthshire Catholics. Thomas, the subject of this note, is thought to have been a member of the Llantarnam or the nearby Bassaleg branch of the Morgans of Tredegar Park. It was acquired by Reginald James Blewitt and rebuilt in Elizabethan style to the designs of Thomas Henry Wyatt in 1834-5.
In 1895, the Abbey was bought by Sir Clifford Cory, colliery owner, shipping magnate and Liberal politician, who lived there until his death in 1941. Without heirs, his barony became extinct. In 1946 it became again a monastic institution, in the hands of the Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy.
The main abbey building became Grade II* listed in 1962.

Terrelle Pryor

Terrelle Pryor (born June 20, 1989) is an American football quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He was the starting quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 2008−2010. Considered the most recruited high school football-basketball athlete in southwestern Pennsylvania since Tom Clements, Pryor was widely regarded as the nation's top football prospect of 2008, and was named "Junior of the Year" by Rivals.com. Pryor had originally hoped to be a two-sport athlete, as he was also one of the nation's most heralded high school basketball players, but he later chose football.
High school career.
At Jeannette- High School, Pryor was clocked at 4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash, and because of his athleticism and frame, he drew comparisons to former Texas standout Vince Young. Pryor also lived up to his recruiting ranking as a basketball player by leading the Jeannette Jayhawks to win their first WPIAL Championship in over 20 years, and then on to win the Pennsylvania PIAA state basketball championship game as a senior. During his junior year, he led the Jayhawks to their first Pennsylvania PIAA Class "AA" state football championship game where they lost to the Warriors of Wilson Area High School.
During the 2007 football season, Pryor and the Jayhawks repeated as champions of the WPIAL. In the Pennsylvania state semi-finals against Wilmington, Terrelle became the first player in Pennsylvania history to run for 4,000 yards and also throw for 4,000 yards. The following week, Pryor led the Jayhawks to their first-ever Pennsylvania state championship by defeating the Dunmore Bucks, 49-21. At the conclusion of the season, Pryor had quarterbacked the Jayhawks to a Pennsylvania state season record of 860 points. Pryor's high school accomplishments include being the two-time Pennsylvania Player of the Year, the offensive Player of the Year and the MVP of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
College recruiting.
Pryor was widely considered one of the top football recruits in the Class of 2008. He was ranked number four in the ESPNU 150 and the number one quarterback. Throughout his high school career, Pryor acquired numerous scholarship offers, initially committing to the hometown University of Pittsburgh to play basketball under coach Jamie Dixon. However, by his senior year his top interests were Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan, Oregon and West Virginia. "Sports Illustrated" called Pryor's announcement "the most anticipated signing day announcement in history."
Pryor originally intended to announce his decision on February 6, National Signing Day, but later changed his mind, stating he still had not decided among Michigan, Ohio State, Oregon, and Penn State. Following the Jeannette basketball team's state championship victory on March 15, Pryor stated he would make his college decision within one week. On March 19, 2008 Pryor announced at a press conference that he would attend Ohio State University.
College career.
Pryor saw limited action in the Buckeye's season opener against Youngstown State. He took more snaps against USC on September 13, 2008, completing 7 of 9 passes for 59 yards, as well as rushing for 40 yards on 11 carries.
On September 20, 2008, Pryor threw for four touchdowns (an Ohio State record for a freshman) and one interception in his first career start for Ohio State. Ohio State beat Troy 28-10. On October 4, 2008, Pryor ran for the winning touchdown against Wisconsin on an option play with running back Chris "Beanie" Wells. On October 25, 2008, in an Ohio State loss against Penn State Pryor threw for a career high 226 yards, connecting on 16 of 25 passes. Against Illinois on November 15, 2008, Pryor had his first career 100-yard rushing day running for 110 yards and a touchdown. In the Fiesta Bowl he lined up at receiver and caught his first touchdown pass in college. Pryor led Ohio State to an 8-1 record as a starter in his freshman year; his only loss as a starter was against Penn State. (Todd Boeckman made the start in the Fiesta Bowl against Texas.) Following the 2008 Big Ten Conference football season, he was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection by the media and Big Ten Freshman of the Year by the coaches.
Before his sophomore year began he ran a 4.33 40-yard dash in a race against Ray Small and many others. He was the fastest Buckeye in 2009.
In his sophomore year Pryor led the Buckeyes to another Big Ten Championship. After starting the season slow he eventually developed into a better passer, and went on to earn the 2010 Rose Bowl MVP trophy after leading Ohio State to a 26-17 victory over Oregon. Pryor had the best passing game of his career, and also rushed for 72 yards. Following the 2009 Big Ten Conference football season, he was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection by the media.
Ohio State began second in most polls and Pryor began the season as a favorite for numerous awards. On September 25, 2010, Pryor had a break-out game in a 73-20 win over Eastern Michigan. He had 6 total touchdowns, including one rushing and one receiving. Following the 2010 Big Ten Conference football season, he was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection by both the coaches and the media. He was edged out by Denard Robinson as the 2010 Big Ten Conference MVP as voted by the Big Ten coaches. They had the same number of first place votes.
On December 23, 2010, the NCAA ruled that Pryor and four of his teammates would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season, as a sanction for selling memorabilia. This suspension did not involve the controversial decision to allow Pryor and his teammates to participate in the University’s season-ending Sugar Bowl game on January 4, 2011.
NCAA investigation and departure from Ohio State.
On May 31, 2011, head coach Jim Tressel resigned following the reports of players receiving improper benefits. The "Columbus Dispatch" reported that the NCAA and Ohio State are investigating more than 50 vehicle purchases by Buckeyes players, family members and friends over the past. "Sports Illustrated" reported that Pryor drove up to eight cars in his three years at Ohio State.
Multiple media outlets also reported that Pryor had been driving on a license that was suspended by the State of Ohio. He drove a Nissan 350Z to a team meeting and workout. "ESPN" reported that his suspension was to expire on August 18, 2011.
In a subsequent report, ESPN also alleged that Pryor made thousands of dollars autographing memorabilia for a local booster, a charge denied by Pryor's attorney.
On June 7, 2011, it was announced that Pryor had chosen to withdraw from the university.
On June 26, 2011, Pryor was banned from all contact with the university's athletic program and new incoming recruits. This caused him to become eligible for the NFL's Supplemental Draft.
Professional career.
2011 NFL Draft.
Pryor held his Pro Day on August 20, 2011, in Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, where representatives from 17 NFL teams were present, including the Oakland Raiders. As was widely anticipated, Pryor demonstrated excellent athleticism and speed for a 6' 6" athlete weighing in at 240 pounds. His 40-yard dash times were clocked from 4.32 to 4.54 seconds, a range of times considered extremely fast for an athlete of his height and weight. Some scouts noted that the turf he ran on was soft, and that he would be even faster on the harder turf he might often encounter in the NFL. His throwing wasn't as impressive, as he completed 27 of 39 passes for just under a 70% completion rate, with 4 of those passes dropped by receivers. Quarterbacks are usually expected to complete around 90% of their passes on their Pro Days, as there are no defenders to prevent the passes from being completed to their receivers.
Oakland Raiders.
2011.
The Oakland Raiders selected Pryor in the third round of the 2011 Supplemental Draft on August 22, 2011; he was the last pick longtime owner Al Davis made in his tenure with the Raiders, thus ending the Al Davis "speed era" including players, Bo Jackson, Darrius Heyward-Bey, and Cliff Branch among others. Three days later, Pryor and the Raiders agreed to a 4-year contract. Pryor served an NFL-mandated 5-game suspension at the beginning of the 2011 NFL season (the suspension being from the Ohio State scandal), but was still able to work out with the club. Pryor was reinstated the day following the team's win over the Houston Texans.
On October 23, 2011, in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Pryor saw his first NFL action. He lined up at the wide receiver spot, motioned behind center and ran a quarterback sneak. The play was nullified due to a false start penalty on Pryor.
2012.
Pryor sat most of the 2012 season, but was the starting quarterback in the season finale against the San Diego Chargers after season-long starting quarterback Carson Palmer went down with an injury the previous week. In his first start, Pryor threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another, threw an interception and completed 46% of his passes in a three-point loss to the San Diego Chargers.
2013.
Following Palmer's trade to the Arizona Cardinals, Pryor was expected to compete with newly acquired quarterbacks Matt Flynn and Tyler Wilson for the Raiders' starting job in 2013. Despite not being given the number 2 jersey at the beginning of his career by the then-coach Hue Jackson because it was formerly worn by JaMarcus Russell, he was able to switch with punter Marquette King and wear the number. On September 2, 2013, it was reported that Pryor would start for the season opener. In the first game against the Indianapolis Colts he broke the Raiders' rushing record for a quarterback with 13 carries for 112 yards. This Raiders record was previously held by Rich Gannon.
In Week 2, the Raiders played at home versus the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Raiders played ball control in the game rushing for over 150 yards and defeating the Jaguars 19-9. Pryor played well in the game completing 15 of 24 passes for 126 yards and no interceptions. He also added 50 yards rushing on 9 carries.
In Week 3, the Raiders played on the road against Denver and the high powered Bronco offense led by Peyton Manning and Wes Welker. Oakland trailed 17-0 before Pryor hit Denarius Moore for a 73-yard touchdown. Pryor was knocked out the game in the second half after suffering a concussion but finished 19 for 28 for 281 yards. He also rushed for 36 yards on just 4 carries. Matt Flynn took over after Pryor left the game but the Raiders still lost 37-21.
In Week 4, Pryor was inactive versus the Washington Redskins. Flynn started the game but without the mobility of Pryor, the offense struggled and the Redskins prevailed over Oakland 24-14. This was the first game that the Raiders played since Pryor was named the starter giving the team a 0-1 record without their quarterback.
In Week 5, Pryor found himself once again at the helm and the Raiders responded against the San Diego Chargers. He threw two touchdowns in the first quarter and completed his first ten passes. Following an early interception against Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers, Pryor responded with a 44-yard touchdown strike to wideout Rod Streater. The second touchdown pass came on a 2-yard pass to wideout Denarius Moore, which gave Oakland a 14-0 lead. In the second quarter, Pryor helped guide to the Raiders to a field goal, which gave his team its first 17-0 lead at home since 2002. In the second half, both Pryor and the Raiders struggled as the Chargers roared back to cut the lead to 24-17. Late in the fourth quarter, Pryor turned what looked to be an easy sack on third down into a 20-yard completion to Brice Butler, which led to a 50-yard field goal and sealed a 27-17 Raiders victory. As of this week, Pryor is 2-3 as a starter and 2-2 as a starter in 2013. One other record was set during this game by Pryor. His 135.7 passer rating versus San Diego marked the highest-rated game by a Raiders quarterback since Rich Gannon's 138.9 rating against the Tennessee Titans on September 29, 2002.
Pryor was sacked 9 times in a loss to Kansas City in week 6 of the 2013 season; he also threw 3 interceptions in the game, making it his worst game as a starter. He finished 18 of 34 for 216 yards and a touchdown pass to Denarius Moore.
In Week 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pryor opened the game with a 93-yard run for touchdown, the longest in NFL history for a quarterback. It was also the longest run of any player in Raiders history. The previous record for Oakland was a 92-yarder set by Bo Jackson on 11/5/1989. Pryor finished with 9 carries for 106 yards and finished 10 of 19 passing for just 88 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.
In Week 9 on November 10, 2013, Pryor was injured in the (24-20) loss to the New York Giants and was sidelined with a sprained MCL. At this stage of the season the Raider's record was (3-6). Being injured, the following week on November 17, 2013, Pryor did not travel with the team in the Raiders win (28-23) against the Houston Texans, where backup quarterback Matt McGloin was the starter. Having had his passing production dip for four games and then being hampered by a right knee sprain limiting his movement in the pocket, the following week November 24, 2013 in the game against the Titans, he was activated to play, but was relegated to backup quarterback behind Matt McGloin.
Seattle Seahawks.
2014.
On April 21, 2014 Pryor was traded to the Seattle Seahawks.
The Raiders received a 2014 seventh-round draft pick in exchange for Pryor. Pryor is expected to compete with B.J. Daniels for the 3rd string job behind backup Tarvaris Jackson and starter Russell Wilson.

Sadigjan

Mirza Sadig (), also spelled Sadikhjan or Sadiqjan, born Sadig Asadoglu (1846, Shusha – 1902, Shusha), was an Azerbaijani tar-player (sazanda) known for developing the Azeri tar (or Caucasus tar or 11 string tar) from the Iranian tar.
Life and Fame.
Sadigjan was born to a poor family of a watchman in Shusha. As a teenager, he took vocal lessons but lost his voice at the age of 18. He then took up pipe, kamancheh and eventually tar. By his mid-20s he was already a well-known tar player in South Caucasus and the neighbouring regions. In the 1890s he founded a musical ensemble which included prominent folk singers and musicians performing Azeri, Armenian and Georgian folk songs.
Developing the Azeri tar.
During the early 1870s, Sadigjan used the traditional Persian tar to develop the new version of this instrument, which later became known as the Azeri tar or the Caucasus tar. The Persian tar has 6 steel strings in 3 double-courses (the low one in octave). The Azeri tar invented by Sadigjan has further one extra bass-string on the side, on a raised nut, and usually 2 double resonance strings via small metal nuts halfway the neck. All these strings are running next to the main strings over the bridge and are fixed to a string-holder and the edge of the body. Overall the Azeri tar has 11 strings and 17 tones.
Early tar players held the instrument to their knees. Sadigjan developed a new manner by reducing the size of the instrument, and for the first time presented the play on a tar nestled to the chest. The Azeri tar became a symbol of Azerbaijani music in the 20th century.
A tar is depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 1 manat banknote issued in 2006.

Huddersfield Ben

Huddersfield Ben (ca. 1865 – 23 September 1871), an early Yorkshire Terrier, is universally acknowledged to be the foundation sire of the breed. In his day Ben won many prizes, both as a show dog and in ratting contests. He had tremendous influence in setting the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier, a new breed still under development in Ben's day. Although larger than a standard Yorkshire Terrier, Ben regularly sired stock under 7 pounds.
Pedigree.
Mr. and Mrs. M.A. Foster of Bradford, in West Yorkshire England, owned Huddersfield Ben. The dog was bred by Mr. W. Eastwood in the town of Huddersfield, England. According to Ben's pedigree, he was linebred (the product of a mother-son pairing), as was his mother Lady. Lady was the great-great-granddaughter of Mr. J. Swift's Old Crab, a long coated black and tan terrier born around 1850. Old Crab and Old Kitty, a Paisley Terrier owned by J. Kershaw of Halifax, West Yorkshire England, are the earliest recorded predecessors to the Yorkshire Terrier.
Show career.
Huddersfield Ben, registration number 3612, had an accomplished career in dog shows. He competed in Manchester in 1869 and placed second. He was shown again at Manchester in 1870 and won first place. At the Crystal Palace dog shows in 1870 and 1871, Ben took first and second prizes, respectively. Throughout his show career, Ben won 74 prizes.
Foundation sire.
In spite of his short lifespan, Huddersfield Ben was responsible for producing most of the foundation stock of the Yorkshire Terrier. He was an extremely popular stud dog, being prepotent, and especially due to his reputation as one of the first to breed true to type Yorkshire Terriers. Although between 9 -12 lb, he regularly sired stock that competed in the under 7 lb limit.
Death and Taxidermy.
At the age of 6, Ben was run over by a carriage and killed. After Ben's death, his body was preserved and kept under glass, which allowed many to see this famous dog long after his death.

Vespasiano da Bisticci

Vespasiano da Bisticci (1421–1498) was an Italian humanist and librarian. 
Born near Rignano sull'Arno, not far from Florence, he was chiefly a dealer in books, or "cartolaio", and had a share in the formation of all the great libraries of the time. When Cosimo de' Medici wished to create the Laurentian Library of Florence, Vespasiano advised him and sent him by Tommaso Parentucelli (later Pope Nicholas V) a systematic catalogue, which became the plan of the new collection. In twenty-two months Vespasiano had 200 volumes made for Cosimo by twenty-five copyists. Most of them were, under the circumstances, books of theology and liturgical chant. 
He had performed important services for the diffusion of classical authors when Nicholas V, the true founder of the Vatican Library, became pope. He devoted fourteen years to collecting the library of Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, organizing it in a quite modern manner; it contained the catalogues of the Vatican, of San Marco, Florence, of the Visconti Library at Pavia, and Oxford. 
Vespasiano had a limited knowledge of Latin, and he is one of the few writers of the time who acknowledged it. Untrained as a writer, but with a discernment and intelligence in the appraisal of important figures, he left a collection of 300 biographies that is a major source of shrewd observation and reliable facts for the history of 15th-century humanism: "Vite di uomini illustri del secolo XV". He retired in 1480, disheartened by the advance of the printing press that was displacing the beautifully lettered manuscripts that were his stock in trade and his love. He is not to be compared to Italian historians such as Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini, but he depicts the atmosphere of the period and its intellectual life. His accounts plunge the reader into the social world of Florence; they contain delicate pictures of manners, charming portraits, noble female figures, of which last point it is possible to judge by reading the biography of Alessandro Bardi (ed. Mai, 593). The general tone is that of a moralist, who shows the dangers of the Renaissance, especially for women, warns against the reading of the novelists, and reproaches the Florentines with usury and illicit gains. Vespasiano is a panegyrist of Nicholas V, the great book-lover; he is severe to the point of injustice against Pope Callistus III, the indifferent lender of books, which, however, he did not give over to pillage, as Vespasiano accuses him of doing.
His manuscripts, which he thought of as rough notes for a more polished series of Latin "Vitae", remained unknown until they were discovered by Cardinal Angelo Mai, who first published them in 1839. A reading of them in Mai's edition in 1847 inspired Jacob Burckhardt to commence his magisterial "Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy" (1860).

Eliza Wallace

Eliza Wallace, known by her pseudonym as Big Mary or Boston Mary, (fl. 1863-1869) was a New York criminal during the late 19th century; among her known aliases included Eliza Gilford, Mary Anderson and Mary Rogers. An associate of Fredericka Mandelbaum, she was a prominent thief and con artist in New York's underworld during the 1860s and 70s.
In 1863, Wallace was arrested under the alias Mary Anderson for stealing silk from "Stewart's" and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment as well as serving a two and a half year prison sentence in Sing Sing Prison for shoplifting under the name Eliza Gilford. 
On June 25, 1868, she was arrested on charges of stealing 70 yards of silk estimated to be worth $210 from the "Lake & McCreery" store on Broadway. After posting bail, she failed to appear in court and an arrest warrant was issued by District Attorney A. Oakey Hall on July 8. However, a search by Capt. John Jourdan of the Sixth Precinct failed to locate her and she remained a fugitive for over a year before he received information that she was in Philadelphia. After gaining consent by police officials, a Detective Woolridge was sent to take her into custody on January 22, 1869. 
Returning with Wallace the following day, she was arraigned before a Justice Dowling (the Court of General Sessions having adjourned shortly before his arrival). 
She was additionally wanted by police officials in Philadelphia on between six to eight criminal charges while awaiting trial in New York.

Quicken Loans National

The Quicken Loans National is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour in the Washington D.C. area. It was played from 2007 to 2013 as the AT&T National and is held either during late June or during the Fourth of July weekend. The event is hosted by Tiger Woods and benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation. The first edition in 2007 was held July 5–8 at the Blue Course of the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, northwest of Washington. The event returned to Congressional in 2008 and 2009 and has been held midway between the U.S. Open and The Open Championship to ensure a strong field of competitors.
The event was officially announced on March 7, 2007, to replace The International, which tour officials had abruptly cancelled on February 8, 2007. The Quicken Loans National does not use the modified Stableford scoring system used by The International in Colorado.
The D.C. area hosted a regular tour event for over a quarter century. The Kemper Open arrived in 1980 but was terminated after the 2006 event. It was played at Congressional from 1980 to 1986, then moved to the nearby TPC at Avenel in 1987. Later renamed the Booz Allen Classic, Congressional hosted the tournament in 2005, while Avenel underwent renovations.
Congressional originally agreed to host the event for the first two years, and after opting out of hosting the 2009 U.S. Amateur, agreed to host the event in 2009 as well. The Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania hosted the 2010 and 2011 events, due to Congressional being reconfigured for the 2011 U.S. Open. The tournament is scheduled to return to Congressional from 2012 to 2014.
Other courses that were originally considered for the new tournament were in the Kansas City, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Portland areas. Possible sites for the 2010 and 2011 events were the TPC at Avenel in neighboring Potomac (former site of the Booz Allen Classic) and Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Virginia, (four-time host of the Presidents Cup).
CBS Sports and Golf Channel currently carry the Quicken Loans National on television.
Invitational status.
The Quicken Loans National is one of only five tournaments given "invitational" status by the PGA Tour, and consequently it has a reduced field of only 120 players (as opposed to most full-field open tournaments with a field of 156 players). The other four tournaments with invitational status are the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the RBC Heritage, the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, and the Memorial Tournament. Invitational tournaments have smaller fields (between 120 and 132 players), and have more freedom than full-field open tournaments in determining which players are eligible to participate in their event, as invitational tournaments are not required to fill their fields using the PGA Tour Priority Ranking System. Furthermore, unlike full-field open tournaments, invitational tournaments do not offer open qualifying (aka Monday qualifying).

Treaty of Constance (1153)

The First Treaty of Constance was signed between the Emperor Frederick I and Pope Eugene III in 1153. By the terms of the treaty, the Emperor was to prevent any action by Manuel I Komnenos to reestablish the Byzantine Empire on Italian soil and to assist the pope against his enemies in revolt in Rome. In 1155, as part of the agreement securing his imperial coronation, Frederick reaffirmed the terms of Constance for Pope Adrian IV. The Second Treaty of Constance made peace between the Emperor and the Lombard League in 1183.

Konwakiton Glacier

The Konwakiton Glacier is a glacier situated on the southern flank of Mount Shasta, in the U.S. state of California. It occupies the head of a large cirque on the south side of Shasta's Misery Hill cone, just northeast of the prominent outcrop of Thumb Rock at about . It is the fifth largest glacier on Mount Shasta, although less than one-third the size of any of the four larger ones (Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum, and Wintun). The Konwakiton is the most frequently visited of Shasta's glaciers, since the standard climbing route up Avalanche Gulch skirts along its western edge above Thumb Rock saddle, with the boot track often only a few feet (about a meter) from the bergschrund at the glacier's head. 
In 2002, scientists made the first detailed survey of Mount Shasta's glaciers in 50 years. They found that seven of the glaciers have grown over the period 1951–2002, with the Hotlum and Wintun Glaciers nearly doubling, the Bolam Glacier increasing by half, and the Whitney and Konwakiton Glaciers growing by a third.

Sally Phipps

Sally Phipps (May 25, 1911 – March 17, 1978) was an American actress.
Early life and career.
Born Nellie Bernice Bogdon in Oakland, California, Phipps was a 1927 WAMPAS Baby Star who was discovered by Frank Borzage
in Los Angeles, California. She had just completed high school when she began making films. Her first role in motion pictures was in "Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl" (1926). Soon she completed appearances in both "Girls" (1927) and "Love Makes 'Em Wild" (1927). In "Gentlemen Prefer Scotch" (1927) Phipps played a charmer in a Fox Film comedy.
In August 1927 she signed a five-year contract with Sol M. Wurtzel. Wurtzel was personal secretary to William Fox. Fox sent Wurtzel to supervise West Coast productions for his studio in 1917. Phipps' Fox Film October 1927 contract stipulated she was bound to the studio for a period of five years. She would be paid a starting wage of $125 which would rise to $600 a week for the last six months before expiration.
Phipps was the lead for Fox's production of "None But the Brave" and "The News Parade" (both 1928). Her co-star for the former film was Charles Morton and the latter was Nick Stuart. "The News Parade" is about the life of a news cameraman and the daughter of a camera-shy millionaire. The motion picture was filmed in New York. A 1927 review of Phipps in "Love Makes 'Em Wild" complimented her skill as a performer. It said:
Miss Phipps is one of the most charming actresses we have had the privilege of seeing in many a day. She has a personality which is distinctly individual, to say the least, and flirts across the silver sheet with a grace which would become an actress of many more years experience.
Her last screen credit was in the 1929 film "Detectives Wanted".
Death.
Sally Phipps died in Brooklyn, New York on March 17, 1978, at the age of 66.

The Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF), also known as FGF7, is a growth factor present in the epithelialization-phase of wound healing. In this phase, keratinocytes are covering the wound, forming the epithelium.
KGF is a small signaling molecule that binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b). For signalling to occur, a dimer is required between two FGF:FGFR complexes that is linked together by a molecule of heparin. 
There are 23 known FGFs, and 4 FGF receptors. FGF:FGFR binding is complex and regulated by a variety of mechanisms in a tissue specific manner.
FGF10 is also known as "Keratinocyte growth factor 2".

<doc id="9919013" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9919013" title="Bikfaya">
Bikfaya

Bikfaya (, also spelled Bickfaya, Beckfayya, or Bekfaya) is a town in the Matn District region of Mount Lebanon. Its stone houses with red-tiled roofs resting amidst pine and oak forests make Bikfaya one of the most sought-after suburbs of Beirut and one of Lebanon's most popular summer resorts.
Culture.
La Fête des Fleurs à Beckfayya or the Festival of Flowers has attracted tourists since 1934 when Maurice Gemayel started the festival to attract attention to the mountainous town. Each year, a variety of vehicles decorated with thousands of colorful flowers and fruits parade through Bikfaya's tree-lined main street. Live music bands, bazaars, and the election of three beauty queens: the Queen of Flowers, the Queen of Fruits and the Queen of Sports, are held in the public squares and gardens.
Demography.
Bikfaya is home to 20,000 Lebanese who are followers of the Maronite Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, Baptist and other Christian churches. Bikfaya is also the summer seat of the Armenian Catholicos of Cilicia.
Etymology.
The name Bikfaya is a contraction of the Aramaic (Syriac) compound phrase "Beit Kiifa", בית קיפיא, with "Kifayya" being the relative adjective of the word "rock" or "stone" in Aramaic. And so, Bikfaya would mean the "house of stone" or "the rocky/stony house" with the semantic connotation of "the place, location of stones, or stone quarry."
Geography.
Bikfaya is nestled in the mountains overlooking the Mediterranean with an elevation ranging from 900 to 1000 meters above sea level. It lies 25 km from Beirut and only a short drive to the Mzaar-Kfardebian ski resort. Summers in Bikfaya are cool and characterized by periods of fog in the afternoon.
The Greater Bikfaya consists of the towns of Bikfaya بكفيا, Mhaydseh المحيدثة, Sakiyat al Mesek ساقية المسك, and Bhersaf بحرصاف.
History.
The name of the town comes from Phoenician origin (Beit Kfeya) the stone house – that is consecrated to worship the God "Kifa".
Church historian, the German historian Roehinger, proved that the Christian peoples—later known as al-Marada—have dwelled in this area and built BasKinta, Bikfaya, and Bhersaf starting around the year 679; a short time before building Ehden in north Lebanon. Historians mention as well that Bikfaya and Bhersaf were the headquarters of the Maronite Emirs and Bishops starting from the 7th Century A.D. and the most distinguished of these was Emir Semaan who resided in Bhersaf in the 11th century.
The residents of the old Kesrwan (which included at the time the Metn area and its surroundings) supported the Crusaders who stayed in this country from 1098 till 1291.
When the Crusaders withdrew from these lands, the Arabs led their first Mamluk campaign in revenge under the leadership of prince Pedra in 1292. However, these harsh mountains proved resistant to Mamluk soldiers who led a second campaign in 1293 which ended in the death of their leader and the slaughter of most of their soldiers.
The Marada victories filled the Mamluk with hatred.
They gathered an army of fifty thousand warriors who attacked Kesrwan in 1305. They destroyed villages, burned temples, cut trees and wiped out all traces of construction and also killed everyone they could lay hands on. Only a few of the residents of these areas survived and wandered in the mountains of North Lebanon. As such, Bikfaya and its surroundings remained uninhabited until the 16th century.
Bikfaya during the era of the Assafiyeen Emirs
Feudalism in the Mamluk era was granted by the sultan in return for military services provided by individuals to the state.
The Mamluk granted the Turkuman (known as Assafiyeen) control over the north (Lubnan Fi al-Tarikh- Dr Philip Hitty- Dar al –Thakafa- Beirut, 1959) with the mission to safeguard the shoreline against intrusion by occidentals and early natives. The Assafiyeen inhabited areas they called after their notables and then moved to Ghazir.
During the era of prince Mansour al-Assafy, with security spreading in the Kesrwan area, some members of the Bikfaya families—who had survived in 1305—started to return to their hometown in 1540 (Sheikh Edmond Bleybel). It seems that prince Mansour decided to befriend the Christians after destroying the Shiites in his area who had plotted to kill him. The Gemayels came from Jaj in 1545 and met him. He honored them and granted them control over Bikfaya and its northern suburbs and sent them immediately to it.
It is told that the Gemayels came to Bikfaya carrying the picture of Mar abda. With them came to Mhaidseh the Maalouf family and the two families became even closer when a member of the Maalouf family (today known as Klink) married the sister of father Antoun Gemayel and was blessed with two children, one of whom became a priest. In 1587 father Antoun sought to build a church in Bikfaya, so he donated one thousand Kobrosy to this cause. However, this sum was not enough and the number of inhabitants of Bikfaya was little, so father Antoun resorted to his brother-in-law and nephew for help and unified the efforts of the two towns and implemented his project next to an old oak tree. The tree is estimated to be around 1000 years old and its trunk still remains visible until our present day.
Antoun set in the south-eastern side of the church an altar in the name of Mar Abda for the Maronites and another in the north–eastern side in the name of Our Lady for the Greek Orthodox (Bleybel).
Dweihy says in his book: the history of the Maronites page 181 :…and in the year 1587 (996H) father Antoun of Gemayel family built the church of Mar Abda in the village of Bikfaya and had it illustrated by Elias al-Hasrouny. He spent on it 1000 Kobrosy in addition to donations by the residents of Bikfaya and other philanthropists… then Patriarch Sarkis followed in the steps of his predecessors and raised father Antoun to Archbishop as a reward for his efforts.
Historians believe that Bikfaya was the consecrated shrine of the Phoenician Baal. It was also the capital of the Christian Cancimat of Lebanon (1840–1860).
Tourism.
Many restaurants, especially ones specializing in Lebanese Cuisine, can be found in Bikfaya. It also offers tourists rest and leisure in its numerous hotels, amusement centers, and public gardens, such as the Grand Hotel Naas and such as Locanda Corsini guest villa. The Naas is a natural spring and one of Bikfaya's most popular destinations. The Naas has been known for its curative powers attracting hundreds of health-seeking tourists each year.

Sleepytime Trio

Sleepytime Trio is a punk band formed in 1994 in Harrisonburg, Virginia, after the demise of Maximillian Colby.
History.
Following the demise of Maximillian Colby, Sleepytime Trio was started with Drew Ringo (lead singer and guitarist of Maximillian Colby) on guitar and vocals, Ben Davis on bass guitar and vocals, and Jonathan Fuller on drums. Later in the summer of 1995, they added Dave Nesmith (also formerly of Maximillian Colby) on second guitar and vocals. The following summer, the band did a seventeen day/twenty show tour of primarily the eastern United States and parts of Canada. They also later toured Europe and the US. In 1998, the band took an extended hiatus when Ringo relocated to Seattle and the remaining members went on to form Engine Down, The Rah Bras, Milemarker, and Bats & Mice. Ringo and Nesmith recently reunited to form Regents (punk rock band) with former Frodus drummer Jason Hamicker. In May 1999, they played the cities of Chapel Hill, DC, Philadelphia, Worcester, and New York in rapid succession. After taking yet another hiatus, they played several shows on the east coast again in December 1999 with hose.got.cable. On 1 December 2007, Sleepytime Trio performed together again during the Action Patrol reunion gig at Alley Katz in Richmond.
Style.
Many have described Sleepytime Trio's style as screamo and post-hardcore. Their songs consist mostly of heavy screaming and guitar riffs.
