Patricia Anderson

Patricia "Pat" Anderson (born June 4, 1966) is an American politician from the State of Minnesota and a member of the Republican Party. She served as the 17th State Auditor of Minnesota, from 2003 to 2007. Prior to this, she was Mayor of Egan for four years after serving as a city council member for eight years. She also owned Capitol Companies, a direct mail and third party verification business. She is also a former national committeewoman for Minnesota to the Republican National Committee.
Early life.
She attended college and received her bachelor's degree at the University of Minnesota, and later went on to earn a M.A. in Public Administration from Hamline University in Saint Paul.
State Auditor.
Anderson defeated State Treasurer Carol Johnson, the Democratic–Farmer–Labor nominee, and Independence Party nominee Dave Hutcheson in the 2002 State Auditor election. Incumbent Democrat Judi Dutcher had opted not to seek re-election, running unsuccessfully for Governor of Minnesota. Anderson was elected as Pat Anderson Awada, the name she held prior to the finalization of her divorce in 2004.
Anderson ran for re-election to a second term in 2006. She faced Democratic former State Representative Rebecca Otto in the general election. After Otto discovered hundreds of millions of dollars in financial errors made by Anderson, she won the election by the largest margin of victory over an incumbent in 112 years (since 1894). Former Governor Arne Carlson, who had crossed party lines to support Otto during her legal ordeals, also switched his support from Anderson to Otto in the 2006 election. Otto was also endorsed by former State Auditors Mark Dayton and Judi Dutcher.
State Commissioner.
In January 2007, Governor Tim Pawlenty nominated her for a position is his cabinet as Commissioner of Employee Relations, with her responsibilities including the merger of that agency into the Department of Finance. At the time, news sources noted that, at the Governor's direction, she intentionally worked herself out of a job in order to promote greater efficiency in government. She also served as President of the Minnesota Free Market Institute.
2010 elections.
On July 15, 2009, Anderson announced that she was running for Governor of Minnesota in the 2010 election. She touted herself as a "Libertarian-style Republican" who opposes corporate subsidies and represents the party's shifting priorities. However, on January 12, 2010, she announced that she was withdrawing from the governor's race and would again run for State Auditor. Anderson lost her election bid to incumbent Rebecca Otto by 25,483 votes.
RNC.
On April 16, 2011, Anderson was elected national committeewoman for Minnesota to the Republican National Committee to serve out the remaining term of Evie Axdahl, who retired. She garnered 180 votes from delegates to the Republican Party of Minnesota's state central committee meeting in Bloomington. On May 19, 2012, Janet Biehoffer defeated Anderson 215-124 in her quest for a full term as a national committeewoman to the RNC. Anderson's campaign suffered as many of the state central committee members were upset by the election of Ron Paul supporters as delegates to the Republican National Convention. Biehoffer's campaign was largely funded by Native America casino interests in response to Anderson's lobbying for Racino.

Trigger pad

[[Image:footonstompbox.jpg|right|thumb|The Ellis
stomp box sounds like a kick-drum and can be used as a trigger.]]
A trigger pad is an electronic sensor on a drum that produces a certain sound assigned from a sound module once the head has been struck. This device allows drummers to play at a constant dynamic regardless of the physical force used.
Triggers are also used to add more definition to drum sounds and prevent bleeding between sound sources, making it easier to hear clearly every drum hit without rumble or excessive cymbals. An example is where very rapid bass drum hits become difficult to distinguish or even hear in the presence of a full band.
Other uses.
Triggers are often used as a way to count and monitor drum hits, usually as a training device (to see if a drummer misses hits, for example) or in speed attempts. Mike Portnoy uses an electronic drum pad with a hardwired electronic metronome as what he calls the "secret cowbell", to count off the songs in a way that only his fellow band members and the technicians can hear it. Tim Waterson, the current world record holder as stated in the Guinness Book of World Records, uses trigger pads to record his speeds.
They can also be used to send MIDI signals after processed by a sound module to a Light Desk controlling different lights.

(Ain't Nobody Loves You) Like I Do

"(Ain't Nobody Loves You) Like I Do" is a single by American singer La Toya Jackson. The song is taken from her fifth album, "La Toya". It is one of only four songs by Jackson to have an accompanying music video. The song features a bridge sung by Mike Stock.
The single was released in 1987 throughout Europe, excluding the United Kingdom. Despite being produced by the European trio Stock Aitken Waterman, who were big hit-producers at the time, the single failed to chart. The B-side of the single, "(Tell Me) She Means Nothing To You At All", was released as its own single in France. The 12" singles include a longer version of the song.
However, the single did fairly well on the German DJ charts. It debuted at No. 17 and stayed on the charts for several months. She also performed the song on the German television show "Die Verflixte Sieben" (with Rudi Carrell). The music video for the single was given little airplay and was never released on video or DVD. It didn't surface on the internet until March 2007.
"The Miami News" described the number as "so unlike anything Stock Aitken and Waterman have produced that it seems a mistake to see their names on the credits. 'Like I Do' is funky, gritty and doesn't repeat every other verse 25 times."
Music video.
A music video was filmed and released to promote the single. The clip is similar to Jackson's 1983 music video "Heart Don't Lie" in its colourful, cartoon-like cinematography and dance routines. The video can be found on YouTube and on various Jackson fan Web sites.

Trembita

The trembita () is a Dacian, Ukrainian, Polish, and Slovakian alpine horn made of wood. 
Used primarily by mountain dwellers known as Hutsuls and Gorals in the Carpathians. It was used as a signaling device to announce deaths, funerals, weddings.
The tube is made from a long straight piece of pine or spruce (preferably one that has been struck by lightning). This is split in two in order to carve out the core. The halves are once again joined together and then wrapped in birch bark or osier rings. It is also used by shepherds for signaling and communication in the forested mountains and for guiding sheep and dogs. The "trembita" has a timbre that is much brighter than those of the Alpenhorn due to its narrow bore and very minor flare.
The trembita has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure natural harmonic series of the open pipe. The upper harmonics are the more readily obtained by reason of the small diameter of the bore in relation to the length. 
The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western equal temperament. Most prominently within the trembita's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.
In the hands of a skilled composer or arranger, the natural harmonics can be used to haunting melancholy effect or, by contrast, to create a charming pastoral flavor.
Trembita showed in 2004 Eurovision Song Contest by the Ukrainian winner of contest Ruslana during the performance of song Wild Dances.
Today it is often used in Ukrainian ethnographic ensembles and as an episodic instrument in the Ukrainian folk instrument orchestra.

<doc id="5948207" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948207" title="English-language learner">
English-language learner

An English language learner (often capitalized as English Language Learner or abbreviated to ELL) is a person who is learning the English language in addition to their native language. The instruction and assessment of students, their cultural background, and the attitudes of classroom teachers towards ELLs have all been found to be factors in ELL student achievement. Some ways that have been suggested to assist ELLs include bringing their home cultures into the classroom, involving them in language-appropriate content-area instruction from the beginning, and by integrating literature into the learning program. Some educational advocates, especially in the United States, prefer for a student learning any second language the term emergent bilingual. 
Issues in the classroom.
There are a considerable number of ESL students (English as a Second Language) in classrooms today, causing a strong need for additional programs and services. Unfortunately, there are many critical issues that relate to culturally and linguistically diverse students. Four critical issues that are found in today’s classrooms when teaching diverse learners are instruction, assessment, the role of culture, and the teacher’s attitudes. It has become vital to integrate culture, literature, and other disciplines into content and language.
Instruction.
The first critical issue is focused on instruction of the ESL students within the classroom and how it is related to Standards-based content and ESL instruction. Some teachers may feel that ESL instruction may be a separate entity from standard-based instruction. On the contrary, we need to acknowledge the fact that they are intertwined with each other. or the English TESOL Standard 3a states that teachers should “know, understand, and use evidence‐based practices and strategies related to planning, implementing, and managing standards‐based ESL and content instruction”. In a five week study by Huang, researched showed that “classroom instruction appeared to play an important role in integrating language skills development and academic content learning.” This study showed that the “students acquire linguistic/literacy skills and scientific knowledge hand in hand as they assume various communicative and social roles within carefully planned language activities”. By tying in written texts with the science content the students were able to improve their language development between drafts and build on their science content knowledge.
Assessment.
The second critical issue is focused on fair and balanced assessment within the ESL classroom. Some teachers may come across being biased without even recognizing it. “All too often, though, these students are either asked to participate in tests that make unfair assumptions about their English-language proficiency in order to assess their content knowledge or conversely, are totally excluded from any testing until their English-language proficiency has reached a certain level,”. TESOL standard 4a states that’s teachers need to “demonstrate understanding of various assessment issues as they affect ELLs, such as accountability, bias, special education testing, language proficiency, and accommodations in formal testing situations”. When the teachers are capable of understanding the various assessment issues they will be able to execute reasonable, consistent, and balanced assessments. “When visual tactile, kinesthetic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills are equally recognized avenues of learning and intellect, CLD students have increased access to the curriculum and opportunities to demonstrate authentically internalized knowledge,”. By having a variety of assessments students will be able to perform to the best of their knowledge. Therefore, it is vital to have alternative methods of assessing ESL students.
Culture.
Culture is the third issue that may not always be recognized in a mainstream classroom. Many teachers overlook culture and try to jump right into English and content knowledge without knowing their students backgrounds. Teachers need to be open to learning new cultures and having their student embrace all cultures in the classroom. By taking great strives to learn about each other’s values and beliefs the teacher and student would not only maximize the effectiveness of ESL but make it a successful learning experience for all involved. A student who is shy or reluctant to answer questions may be more outspoken when talking about their own values that tie in with their home life. An ESL teacher, in a study called Losing Strangeness to Mediate ESL Teaching, “connects culture to religious celebrations and holidays and the fusion invites students to share their knowledge”. This will encourage students to open up and talk about their cultural backgrounds and traditions within their family. “Teachers who encourage CLD students to maintain their cultural or ethnic ties promote their personal and academic success”. Students should not lose their identity but gain knowledge from their culture and the world around them. Therefore it is beneficial to bring culture into the ESL classroom in order for the students to feel a sense of worth in school and in their lives.
Teacher attitude.
The fourth critical issue is the attitudes of the teachers which plays a major role in the ESL classroom. Some teachers may have a negative, unwelcoming attitude. Research shows that teachers negative attitudes may stem from “chronic lack of time to address ELLs’ unique classroom needs", "intensification of teachers workloads when ELLs are enrolled in mainstream classes", and "feels of profession inadequacy to work with ELLS”. Also, the lack of training will have a huge impact on their teaching practices and professional development. The teachers will then be stressed and nervous to go about a lesson. Their anxiety will roll over into the classroom and have a negative impact on the ESL students’ performances. “Teachers’ language-acquisition misconceptions may color their attitudes towards ELLs and ELL inclusion, leading educators to misdiagnose learning difficulties or misattribute student failure to lack of intelligence or effort”. By providing a good learning environment, it will have a positive effect on the students overall success in terms of linguistic, social, cognitive, and academic developments.
Systematic Integration of Culture, Literature and other Disciplines
Enriching the Classroom Environment.
In order to have an environment that is beneficial for the teacher and the student culture, literature, and other disciplines should be integrated systematically into the instruction. “Postponing content-area instruction until CLD students gain academic language skills widens the achievement gap between the learners and their native-English speaking peers”. Relating to culture, teachers need to integrate it into the lesson, in order for the students to feel a sense of appreciation and a feeling of self-worth. 
By integrating literature into the instruction students will benefit substantially. “Reading texts that match learner interests and English proficiency provide learners with comprehensible language input--a chance to learn new vocabulary in context and to see the syntax of the language”. Students will be motivated and will make learning more enjoyable. Lastly, by integrating other disciplines into the lesson it will make the content more significant to the learners and will create higher order thinking skills across the areas. By integrating language into other contents, it focuses not only on learning a second language, but using that language as a medium to learn mathematics, science, social studies, or other academic subjects”. When language and content areas are integrated ESL students become aware “that English is not just an object of academic interest nor merely a key to passing an examination; instead, English becomes a real means of interaction and sharing among people”. Therefore, students will be able to communicate across the curriculum, acquire higher level skills, and be successful in their daily lives.
Strategies for supporting English language learners in the classroom.
The internet makes it possible for students to view videos of activities, events and places around the world. Viewing these activities can help English language learners to develop an understanding of new concepts while at the same time building topic related schema (background knowledge). 
Teacher can provide opportunities for English language learners to acquire vocabulary and build knowledge through hands-on learning. 
In order to make learning more meaningful, connect a new topic to an experience or event from the English language learners background. This can support the English language learner in making connections between vocabulary in their L1 (first language) and English.

Partick Central railway station

Partick Central railway station was a station serving the Partick area of the city of Glasgow. Built in the 1890s by the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway Company, it sat on a line that ran along the north bank of the River Clyde from Stobcross to Dumbarton.
History.
The station was renamed "Kelvin Hall" in 1959, as it was in the vicinity of the building of that name, and was close, but not attached to, the Partick Cross station on the Glasgow Subway.
Passenger and goods services to the station ceased in 1964 when it closed as part of the Beeching cuts to rail services across the UK. The station building was later used as a workshop and an auction house before lying empty for a number of years. The remains of the platforms and trackbed, which were underneath the station building, have been removed but the railway's route is fairly discernible. The station's goods yard served as a site for travelling people and as a scrap merchants.
Redevelopment of site.
The site had been empty and awaiting redevelopment when in 2004 it emerged that the supermarket chain Tesco wished to develop a 24-hour operation there, in the face of local opposition STOP. Tesco had the station building demolished on 28 January 2007, before planning permission had been given for the development from Glasgow City Council.

Stephen Geyer

Stephen Geyer (born Stephen George Geyer on November 21, 1950), a songwriter, moved to Los Angeles in 1972 after attending Towson State College (now Towson University), in Maryland, as an art major. Since coming to L.A., Stephen has made a name for himself as the writer of hit songs, popular TV themes, TV and film scripts, a non-fiction author, and studio and performance guitarist. He was born in Lima, Peru, and as the son of a CIA operative, spent most of his formative years overseas, including England where he began his professional musical career during the early Beatles years.
In 1973, after having performed at the BMI showcase in the Capitol Records building in hopes of landing a recording and publishing deal, Stephen was referred by BMI V.P. Ron Anton to Mike Post, a rising star in TV scoring and record production. A twenty-year musical collaboration ensued, yielding several TV theme songs, among the most notable, “Drive” and “Back To Back” for “Hardcastle & McCormick”, “My Opionation” for "Blossom" and, perhaps most notably of all, “Believe It Or Not” for "The Greatest American Hero", which rose to the #1 position on the Record World Chart and to the #2 position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1981.
Additionally, Stephen has the distinction of being the original songwriter (music & lyrics) for all the original episodic songs (30 overall) recorded for The Greatest American Hero television show. He also has written other material for a variety of Stephen J. Cannell productions, including "The A-Team", "Riptide" and "Stingray". Geyer and Post also penned several songs for the Tommy Lee Jones movie, "The River Rat", as well as a number of TV movies including "Locusts" (with Ron Howard) (song “Harvest”) and "The Ray Mancini Story". 
Joining forces with another noted composer, Charles Fox, Stephen wrote “Together Through The Years”, the theme for the variously named Valerie Harper series (i.e."The Hogan Family") as well as five songs for the soundtrack to the Scott Baio debut movie, "Zapped". In 1990, Stephen was called upon to write and to supervise the songwriting staff of Steven Bochco’s harshly critiqued "Cop Rock" television series, now considered something of a TV cult classic. 
Stephen’s guitar chops quickly evolved as he worked beside the cream of L.A.’s session players on Mike Post’s record and scoring dates, and soon he was being called upon for his guitar work and musical leadership in the studio and on the road, touring with a number of artists, including Jonathan Edwards, Herb Pedersen and Carole Bayer Sager. 
Other noted Geyer songs include, “Hot Rod Hearts”, co-written with Bill LaBounty (#3 Billboard hit by Robbie Dupree), “Bloodline” (title song of Glen Campbell’s #1 country album), “Love Brought Us Here Tonight” (gold album by Smokey Robinson), “You Turn The Light On” (#1 platinum album by Kenny Rogers), and “Dreams” (gold album by John Denver).
Stephen has received several BMI awards for his songwriting, as well as an Emmy nomination for his song “Dreams” from an episode of the television show "The Greatest American Hero". Not limited strictly to writing, Stephen also performed the lead vocal on the theme song for the 80's Disney television show "The Wuzzles".
In addition to his work in music, Stephen has penned several scripts for television, including his work as staff-writer for the Mario Van Peebles series "Sonny Spoon", and two scripts for the series "Silk Stalkings". Three of his original film scripts have been sold and put into development, and he is currently working on a fourth.

<doc id="5948229" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948229" title="Oliebol">
Oliebol

An oliebol (, plural oliebollen ) is a traditional Dutch and Belgian food. They are called oliebollen (literally: "oil spheres") in the Netherlands, while in Belgium they are called smoutenbollen (literally: "lard balls" although the real "smout" is of rapeseed oil) in Dutch and croustillons (loosely: "crispies") in French. In English they are more commonly known as "Dutch Doughnuts" or "Dutchies". In the distant region of Istria, now split into the countries of Italy, Croatia and Slovenia, a variation of this dish is called fritole, fritule and blinci.
Oliebollen are a variety of dumpling made by using an ice-scooper or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping the dough into a deep fryer filled with hot oil. In this way, a sphere-shaped oliebol emerges. Oliebollen are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls. 
The dough is made from flour, eggs, yeast, some salt, milk, baking powder and usually sultanas, currants, raisins and sometimes zest or succade. A notable variety is the "appelbeignet" which contains only a slice of apple, but different from oliebollen, the dough should not rise for at least an hour. Oliebollen are usually served with powdered sugar.
In Flanders the "oliebol" is called "smoutenbol" where as the only difference is not baked in vegetable oil, but in animal fat. 
Another difference between the Dutch oliebol and the Flanders smoutenbol is that the smoutenbol is usually not filled in contrast to the Dutch oliebol.
The filling of the oliebol could consist of raisins, currants and apple, other ingredients can be added, such as Succade, pieces of orange or whip cream.
Origin.
They are said to have been first eaten by Germanic tribes in the Netherlands during the Yule, the period between December 26 and January 6 where such baked goods were used. The Germanic goddess Perchta, together with evil spirits, would fly through the mid-winter sky. To appease these spirits, food was offered, much of which contained deep-fried dough. It was said Perchta would try to cut open the bellies of all she came across, but because of the fat in the oliebollen, her sword would slide off the body of whoever ate them. It is also said that the oliebollen come from Portugal. It is suspected that the Portuguese Jews during the Spanish Inquisition fled to the Netherlands with their recipes. In Portugal at that time, there was already something similar to the oliebol: (dried) Southern Fruits.
From oliekoek to oliebol.
For centuries the Dutch ate oliekoek ("oil cake"), an old name for oliebol. The Oliebollen you see in the painting from around 1652 are very similar to today's oliebol. At that time, they were baked in Lard or Raapolie. During the nineteenth century the word "oliebol" started to be used more. In 1868 Van Dale, a famous Dutch dictionary, put the word "oliebol" in its dictionary. But it was not a commonly used word yet said by "Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal" (1896), which is another Dutch dictionary. In that dictionary they say that "oliekoek" is a more commonly used term, but then there was a major change and from the early twentieth century the word "oliekoek" was not used anymore and had been replaced by "oliebol".
Croustillons.
A very similar type of oliebol can also be found in the Walloon part of Belgium, Brussels and northern France. Croustillons are deep fried dough balls served hot and liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar. They are usually served in a paper cone with a little plastic fork to eat them with. They are typically found at fairgrounds in Belgium and in Lille, France.
Oliebollentest.
Since 1993 Dutch newspaper "Algemeen Dagblad" has held an annual highly publicized "oliebollentest" at the end of each year. In 2012, the bakery of Willy Olink from Maarssen won the test. In 2013 Richard Visser won the test for the ninth time in twenty years.

Viyella

Viyella was a blend of wool and cotton first woven in 1893 in England, and soon to be the "first branded fabric in the world". It was made of 55 percent merino wool and 45 percent cotton in a twill weave, developed by James and Robert Sissons of William Hollins & Company, spinners and hosiers. The brand name, first registered as a trademark in 1894, and registered in the United States in 1907, soon covered not only the original fabric, to be sold by the yard (piece goods), but also clothing. At first this was made by separate businesses, but it was not long before Hollins started producing their own clothes and offering franchises to manufacturers who would use the Viyella label. Following increasing emphasis on garment manufacture over the years, Viyella is now a fashion brand for clothes and home furnishings made of a variety of fabrics. The original wool/cotton blend is no longer on sale.
The fabric.
Viyella was a soft dress-weight fabric that was more resistant to shrinkage than any comparable pure wool alternative (challis, for example). In its early years it was marketed as a fabric which combined lightness and fashion with warmth and durability. One 1920s advertisement called it a "guaranteed unshrinkable fine wool flannel" for women who wanted both "daintiness" and "protectiveness". By the early 20th century it came in various weights and widths, some rather narrow by today's standards, and in both plain colours and woven or printed patterns, and was exported from the United Kingdom to other English-speaking countries. Towards the end of the 20th century it was woven in 150cm wide lengths suitable for modern garment design and production.
The first ready-made garments using Viyella were shirts and nightgowns, and soon came dresses, slips and other clothing, much of it produced under franchise arrangements using the Viyella trademark. It was also made into sheets, and at one time Viyella yarn was available for home knitting.
In the mid-20th century the fabric was popular for children's clothes - from babies' nightgowns to winter shirts for British schoolchildren - and for pyjamas, shirts and dresses; it became associated with sensible, cosy clothing. Officers in the British and other Commonwealth armies purchased their uniforms during the Second World War, and Viyella shirts were a desirable option for them. In the late 20th century it was 're-invented' as fashionable fabric. In 1987 "The Times" said it was used by designers interested in "vintage" style, like Laura Ashley, and creators of "modern classics". 
Clydella was a cheaper, less soft alternative made with 81 per cent cotton, produced at factories in the Clydeside area, including Glasgow and Hamilton, where many yards of Viyella were also woven.
Hollins also produced the related Dayella cloth used especially for babies' clothes.
The companies.
The name Viyella is based on the unusually-named valley road, "Via Gellia", (the A5012) near Matlock, where in 1890 Hollins & Co acquired a mill used for the early production of Viyella. Hollins had started business in 1784 in Pleasley, about 20 miles away on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border. Later their offices were at Viyella House in Nottingham.
After a merger in 1961, Hollins became Viyella International, led by Joe Hyman, who in the next few years acquired a series of related companies, with Viyella growing to be one of the biggest textile businesses in the UK, owning 40 factories across the country. After a few years as Carrington Viyella and then Vantona Viyella, the company owning the brand became Coats Viyella (Coats Paton, now Coats plc), who in the 1980s built a new mill to produce Viyella cloth in Barrowford, Lancashire, but this was demolished in 1999. In the 21st century much of Coats manufacturing (now specialising in thread) has been moved abroad and it is no longer possible to buy Viyella fabric. Coats underwent major restructuring in 2002 and sold off its Viyella fashion retail business (and Jaeger) to entrepreneur Richard Thompson in 2003 for £1, who re-sold Viyella weeks later to venture capitalist Harris Watson. Viyella Ladieswear has since added home furnishings to its range of goods. The fashion chain entered Administration on 7 January 2009 citing "an assessment of the current economic situation and the prospects for the future" as the cause.
In 2009, the upmarket retailer Austin Reed agreed to buy Viyella for an undisclosed sum.
In late 2011, Viyella opened its flagship store next to Austin Reed at 92 Regent Street, London.

Cold spot

In ghost hunting, a cold spot is a supposed area of localized coldness or a sudden decrease in ambient temperature with an assumed connection to alleged paranormal activity. A definition of a cold spot that has been used in ghost hunting is "a small, defined area of intense cold (at least 10 degrees colder than the surrounding area) that can not readily be explained by other natural or mechanical causes (e.g. air conditioning, a drafty window, ice or snow).
Background.
Believers claim that cold spots are an indicator of paranormal activity in the area. According to the beliefs of ghost hunters; the cold air seems to be contained within an invisible bubble which they believe to be the ghost itself.
Ghost hunters believe that an invisible ghost is able to make itself visible by drawing on sources of energy such as heat in air so that a specific location becomes unusually cold, however, this belief is at odds with the laws of thermodynamics and scientific understanding of the physical world.
Practices.
Ghost hunters may carry thermographic cameras and infrared thermometers (which can only detect surface temperatures, rather than ambient air temperatures) to detect the presence of purported cold spots in the ambient air of locations that are reported to be haunted. Ghost hunting organizations advise that the spots be checked from several different angles in order to confirm their existence and features.
Ghost hunters prefer to use heat detecting devices rather than reports of feeling cold because the sensation of cold air could be caused by wind chill. Also, a space may feel cold to one person while it feels warm to another.

Felipe Sapag

Felipe Sapag (February 14, 1917 – March 14, 2010) was an Argentine politician, governor of Neuquén Province on five occasions and a leading figure in the Neuquén People's Movement and the locally influential Sapag family.
Life and times.
Sapag was born in Zapala to Lebanese immigrants who had moved to Neuquén in 1913. His elder brother was Elías Sapag, later a senator, and their younger brothers were Amado and José. Felipe Sapag studied in Zapala and Bahía Blanca, but could not finish his secondary education due to the hardship his family endured after the 1930 economic collapse. He and his brothers began to work to support the family and moved to Cutral Có to set up a company. He and his brothers played leading roles in the community, and Felipe founded the local energy co-op and the sports and cultural centre. A Peronist activist, he became a councillor and the first mayor of Cutral-Có in 1952.
Following the military coup d'etat and the banning of the Peronist movement, Sapag and his brothers, together with Carlos Sobisch, founded the Neuquino People's Movement, a provincial political party able to contest elections. Originally called 'Provincial Politics', it was established on June 4, 1961.
Sapag first stood for governor in March 1962, but the elections were annulled by the military government. He was elected governor of Neuquén in 1963, gaining 60% of the vote, and left office in June 1966, deposed by the military; among his administration's notable accomplishments were the establishment of the Neuquén Development Corporation (COPADE), the Bank of the Province of Neuquén, and the "Universidad Provincial del Neuquén" (today the National University of Comahue).
In 1970, in an unexpected decision, he accepted the offer of the military government to become federal receiver of the province, ruling it until 1972. The following year he was re-elected governor, but was again removed after the 1976 military coup.
Following the restoration of democracy, Sapag was returned to the governor's post by voters, serving in 1983–87 and 1995–99. Even in old age, he continued to be active in the politics of his province, and despite calls for him to be expelled from the party he helped found for supporting Néstor Kirchner in the 2003 election, as well as for his support of members of the Sapag family in their campaigns.
Sapag was married to Estela Romeo. They had four children: Luis Felipe, Silvia Estela, Ricardo, and Enrique. Ricardo and Enrique disappeared in the Dirty War that followed the 1976 coup, while Luis and Silvia followed their father into politics. The 93-year-old Felipe Sapag died in his home in Neuquén on March 14, 2010; Governor Jorge Sapag, his nephew, declared seven days of official mourning in his honor.

Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic

The Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic is a phenomenon which affected Bellingham, Seattle, and other communities of Washington state in April, 1954; it is considered an example of a mass delusion. It was characterized by widespread observation of previously unnoticed windshield holes, pits and dings, leading residents to believe that a common causative agent was at work. It was originally thought to be the work of vandals but the rate of pitting was so great that residents began to attribute it to everything from sand flea eggs to nuclear bomb testing.
Originating in Bellingham in March, police initially believed the work to be vandals using BB guns. However the pitting was soon observed in the nearby towns of Sedro Woolley and Mount Vernon and by mid-April, appeared to have spread to the town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island.
Within a week, the news and the so-called "pitting epidemic" had reached metropolitan Seattle. As the newspapers began to feature the story, more and more reports of pitting were called in. Motorists began stopping police cars to report damage and car lots and parking garages reported particularly severe attacks.
Several theories for the widespread damage were postulated:
By April 15, close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as affected.
Finally, Sergeant Max Allison of the Seattle police crime laboratory stated that the pitting reports consisted of "5 per cent hoodlum-ism, and 95 per cent public hysteria." By April 17, the pitting suddenly stopped.
The "Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic" as it is called has become a textbook case of collective delusion (not "mass hysteria" as reported). Although natural windshield pitting had been going on for some time, it was only when the media called public attention to it that people actually looked at their windshields and saw damage they had never noticed before.

Rami Fortis

Rami Fortis (, born July 7, 1954), or simply Fortis, is an Israeli rock singer. Born in Tel Aviv, Fortis became known as a pioneer of Israeli punk rock. His debut album "Plonter", released in 1978, was not a commercial success at the time, though today it is considered an influential cult album. His fame in Israel came with the release of a Hebrew language album, "Sipurim Me'hakufsa (Tales from the Box)", in 1988. Due to his behaviour on stage he was nicknamed The Madman (HaMeshuga).
Apart from his work in music, Rami Fortis is currently serving as a judge for the first season of The X Factor Israel.
Biography.
Rami Fortis is of Iraqi Jewish and Italqim origin. He served in the 1973 Yom Kippur war and was influenced by his experiences at the front. He began his musical career in 1975 as a lighting-man in the shows of Tamuz - one of Israel's prominent rock groups at that time. The band would get him on stage to sing one or two songs in their concerts.
His 1978 debut album, "Plonter", is considered a breakthrough in Israeli music. It was regarded as one of the wildest and noisiest albums ever to be recorded in Israel, way ahead of its time. Influenced by such artists as The Clash, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop and The Ramones, it was characterized by topics and a style that were unfamiliar and unconventional in Israel at the time. A group of his Tel Aviv friends, guitar player Berry Sakharof (with whom Fortis had played in S.O.B), bass player Malka Spigel (who was Fortis' girlfriend at the time) & singer/ poet Samy Birnbach (who had contributed lyrics to "Plonter") formed Minimal Compact in 1981 in Amsterdam. The band established itself as an alternative rock band in Europe, signing to Belgium's Crammed Records label, making two albums and adding drummer Max Franken. In 1984 Fortis was asked to join and stayed with them up to the first split in 1988. He was part of the line up which produced the band's two best known albums: "Deadly Weapons" produced by Tuxedomoon's Peter Principle and "Raging Souls" produced by Wire's Colin Newman. He went on to tour with them extensively in Europe and Japan. Minimal Compact remain notable as the first (mainly) Israeli band to have gained considerable success outside of the country. They had a song ("When I go") included in Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" soundtrack and had covers designed by Neville Brody and Russell Mills.
On his return to Israel in 1988, Fortis recorded his second album, "Sipurim Mehakufsa" ("Tales from the Box"), a collaboration with Berry Sakharof which has been described as "the best thing to happen to Israeli Rock". Later albums included a collaboration with Mashina's Shlomi Bracha. Since 2004 the collaboration with Berry Sakharof has been revived with the re-formation of the duo Fortisakharof.
Fortis resides in Beit Yitzhak and is married to Naomi, director of the Batsheva Dance Company.
In 2008, Fortis was featured on the documentary movie "On the Move" about Ehud Banai and the Refugees.
In 2011, Fortis released an album called "The Friend I", influenced by Nikola Tesla.

<doc id="5948266" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948266" title="Secondary products revolution">
Secondary products revolution

Andrew Sherratt's model of a secondary products revolution involved a widespread and broadly contemporaneous set of innovations in Old World farming. The use of domestic animals for primary carcass products (meat) was broadened from the 4th-3rd millennia BC to include exploitation for renewable 'secondary' products: milk, wool, traction, riding and pack transport.
The SPR model incorporates two key elements:
Many of these innovations first appeared in the Near East during the fourth millennium BC and spread to Europe and the rest of Asia soon afterwards. They appeared in Europe by the beginning of the third millennium BC. These innovations became available in Europe due to the westwards diffusion of new species (horse, donkey), breeds (e.g. woolly sheep), technology (wheel, ard) and technological knowledge (e.g. ploughing). Their adoption can be understood in terms of pastoralism, plough agriculture and animal-based transport facilitating marginal agricultural colonisation and settlement nucleation. Ultimately it was revolutionary in terms of both origins and consequences. 
However, both the dating and significance of the archaeological evidence cited by Sherratt (and thus the validity of the model) have been questioned by several archaeologists. The dangers of dating the innovations on the basis of evidence such as iconography and waterlogged organic remains with restricted chronological and geographical availability have been pointed out. Sherratt has himself acknowledged that such dates provide a "terminus ante quem" for the invention of milking and ploughing.
Direct evidence for how domestic animals were exploited in later prehistoric Europe has grown substantially, in quantity and diversity, since 1981. Initially the concepts of the SPR were tested by analysing the appearance of certain artefact types (e.g. ploughs, wheeled vehicles). By the middle 1980s the most common means of testing the model derived from the more ubiquitous faunal (zooarchaeological) assemblages, through which mortality patterns, herd management and traction-related arthropathies were utilized to confirm or reject the SPR model. Many zooarchaeological studies in both the Near East and Europe have confirmed the veracity of the model.
However the detection of milk residues in ceramic vessels is now considered the most promising means of detecting the origins of milking. Discovery of such residues has pushed back the earliest date for milking into the Neolithic. A study of more than 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and Southeastern Europe indicated that milking had its origins in northwestern Anatolia. The lowland, coastal region around the Sea of Marmara favoured cattle-keeping. Pottery from these sites dating from 6500–5000 BC showed milk being processed into dairy products. Milk residues had already been found in vessels from the British Neolithic, but farming arrived in Britain late (c. 4000 BC).
The seeming contradiction between the zooarchaeological and residue studies appears to be a matter of scale. The residues indicate that milking may have played a role in domestic animal exploitation from the later Neolithic. The zooarchaeological studies indicate that there was a massive change in the scale of such production strategies during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age.

Sex and Death 101

Sex and Death 101 is a 2007 dark comedy science fiction film written and directed by Daniel Waters released in the United States on April 4, 2008. This film marks the reunion of writer-director Daniel Waters and Winona Ryder, who previously worked on 1989's "Heathers", written by Waters.
Plot.
Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) is a successful young businessman with a great job as an executive for 'Swallows', a high end fast food restaurant chain, and a beautiful fiancée, Fiona Wormwood (Julie Bowen). On the day of his bachelor party, he is e-mailed a list of all the women he has slept with. Strangely, while the list has 101 names, his fiancée is only number 29. He assumes the list is a prank, courtesy of his best friends Zack (Neil Flynn) and Lester (Dash Mihok) - until he meets number 30, Carlotta Valdez, who is the stripper at his bachelor party. After sleeping with Carlotta, he realizes the list does, in fact, comprise all of his sexual partners, both past and future.
Roderick cancels his upcoming wedding and begins to sequentially bed all the people on the list. Although he makes a connection with some of the women, he is unable to settle down and is compelled to continue until he has crossed all names off the list. His friends become concerned for his mental well being and convince him to bury the list. Before he does that, he sees only part of the next name, including "Dr." and the first few letters. He falls for Lester's charming and quirky veterinarian (Leslie Bibb), after believing she is the next name on the list and finding they have much in common, only to discover that she does not return his feelings, and wants to be 'just friends'. He digs up the list and discovers she was not listed, after which she has an untimely accidental death. He continues on his mission.
Throughout all this, a female vigilante, nicknamed by the media 'Death Nell' (Winona Ryder), has been taking revenge on men who she feels have taken sexual advantage of women. She seduces these men and then drugs them to induce a coma, leaving them behind along with a line of feminist poetry spray painted on the wall or ceiling. But after her most recent conquest, she accidentally leaves behind her drivers license, exposing her real identity, Gillian De Raisx, to the world.
Roderick's precarious mental state is compromised when he realizes the last name on his list is Gillian's. With twenty more names left on the list, he decides to abandon it altogether and takes up various hobbies to keep him from giving in to temptation. After an accident during a bike ride, he is found by a group of female students (all virgins) from a Catholic college who believe that he has been 'divinely delivered' to deflower them. Roderick is unable to resist and catapults himself from number 82 through number 99 in the space of an afternoon. He realizes only one woman is left, and then he remembers the girls' bus driver was number 100.
Knowing that Death Nell is the last person on his list (and that he may not survive a night with her) Roderick tries to change his destiny, first by becoming a shut in, and then by tracking down another Gillian de Raisx in Sydney, Australia. But when he learns that the Agency are close to catching Death Nell, he has a sudden change of heart. Guilt-stricken over his treatment of his previous conquests, he decides to face the consequences.
Roderick and Gillian meet in a diner, where they share a meal and conversation. Gillian reveals that she was a Poetry/Chemistry student who married young and was forced to perform degrading sexual favors with her husband, who also physically abused her. After his death, which was inadvertently caused by Gillian, she realized that she could dish out similar punishments to other men who treated women badly. Gillian reveals that she is exhausted from the whole ordeal and unsure if she has the conviction to continue. Roderick and Gillian connect, and agree to each take the sedative together. They take the pills simultaneously, and spend the night together, with 'The End' spray painted on the wall behind them.
The epilogue reveals that Roderick and Gillian survived the pills. They're happily married and have a son. Death Nell's comatose victims are revived and a brief scene at the Agency suggests that Roderick and Gillian's union was fated.
Critical reception.
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. The review in "The New York Times" dismissed it as an "unfortunate comedy". Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 23% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 30 reviews.

Orthodox Christianity.
Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in Montenegro. Adherents of Orthodox Christianity in Montenegro are predominantly Montenegrins and Serbs. While the Serbs are adherents of the Serbian Orthodox Church and its diocese in Montenegro, the "Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral", Montenegrins are divided between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Montenegrin Orthodox Church (which is still in its phase of conceivement and is non-canonical and unrecognized).
The identity of Montenegrins and Serbs in Montenegro is largely based on Orthodox Christianity.
Islam.
Muslims form the largest minority religion in the country. Montenegro's 118,477 Muslims make up 19.11% of the total population. They are divided into these main groups: Slavic Muslims (split among Bosnian-speaking Bosniaks, Slavic Muslims, Montenegrin-speaking Muslim Montenegrins), and ethnic Albanians. Islam is the dominant religion in the northeastern municipalities, which are part of the Sandžak geographical region, and in municipalities where Albanians form a majority. Islam is the majority religion in Rožaje, Plav, Ulcinj and Petnjica.
Catholicism.
Catholic Christianity is mostly present in the region of Boka Kotorska, where there is a significant presence of ethnic Croats. Also, a number of ethnic Albanians are adherents of Catholic Christianity.
According to CNEWA Canada Catholics of the Byzantine Rite number over 20 000 persons in the regions of Montenegro and Serbia: 
In 2003 an Apostolic Exarchate was created for Greek Catholics in Serbia and Montenegro, headed by Bishop Djura Džudžar (born 1954, appointed 2003). It has 21 parishes and 22,720 faithful, consisting mostly of a group of ethnic Rusyn Greek Catholics in the region of Vojvodina.
Judaism.
In February of 2012, the Montenegrin Prime Minister Igor Lukšić signed an agreement with the Montenegrin Jewish community to grant official recognition of Jews as a minority in Montenegro. The agreement also established Judaism as the country's fourth official religion, along with Roman Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and Islam.
Irreligion.
Montenegro's population is mainly religious - 98.69% of its population are the adherents of some religious group. On the census from 2011, atheists comprised about 1.24% of the whole population, and agnostics 0.07%. Religiosity is lowest in Herceg Novi, which is 2.43% atheist, Kotor (2.03%) and the capital Podgorica (1.99%). In contrast, Rožaje has the fewest atheists, who make up only 0.01% of its population.

It's Okay (One Blood)

"It's Okay (One Blood)" is a song by American rapper and West Coast hip hop artist The Game featuring vocals from reggae singer Junior Reid, from his second studio album Doctor's Advocate. Released as the album's lead single on July 24, 2006, the song was written by The Game himself and Junior Reid, and it was produced by D-Roc, and Reefa. The Game himself revealed that the song would be released on July 31, 2006, but actually was released on July 24, 2006. The song was originally to be released on July 4, 2006 but got pushed back by The Game. Jimmy Rosemond, head of Czar Entertainment and The Game's manager, explained how "One Blood" would receive positive radio airplay and prove the talent that The Game had. A supposed original version of the song was released in late January 2011. The song was produced by Dr. Dre.
Background.
When news of The Game's first single was announced by Rosemond, it was revealed simply as "One Blood" and is the name it commonly goes by (also, the words "Blood" and "One Blood" are repeated throughout the song). The song samples Junior Reid's "One Blood" and features Junior Reid himself. According to Reefa, the producer of the song, "One Blood" was mixed by Rap-A-Lot/Tha Dogg Pound affiliated producer Mike Dean for Dean's List Productions. Several lines in the song stirred controversy as to who the lines were aimed at: "You 38 and you still rappin, ugh", was aimed at Jay-Z, as well as a diss at snap music; "Turn on the TV and all you see is the A/You niggaz better make up a dance and try to get radio play/Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away." After he clearly made a diss to Atlanta, GA, The Game later changed his mind about who he was referring to in a radio interview with HOT 107.9 and said the following:
Banks and Buck have albums coming out near to mines, you know what I'm saying? So I'm telling them if they trying to sell some records this time, then they better fly to the "A" and get to, you know, doing something, you know? Y'all make up a dance to the song, you know what I'm saying? It's all good. And you know, just to say it again man, I'M NOT DISSING THE "A"!
The Game made a music video for the song, which debuted on BET on August 22, 2006. The video features revised lyrics in order to accommodate television decency standards. There are appearances in the video by Juice, Ya Boy, Nu Jerzey Devil, DJ Skee, Andrew Reid, Wada Blood, Young JR, Mickey Jarrett Jr and Tyrese.
In the song, The Game mentions the following rappers, in order, and some repeated: Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Eazy-E, Young Jeezy, Lil Jon, The Notorious BIG, Ice Cube, Nas and Tupac Shakur.
This song is also included in the video game "" for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. It is the fighting song The Game uses.
Remixes.
An official remix was released on November 7, 2006. It features 25 hip-hop artists including The Game. They rap in this order:

Ulmus serotina

Ulmus serotina Sarg., the September Elm, is an 
American species uncommon beyond Tennessee; only very locally distributed through Illinois, Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Alabama and Georgia, growing predominantly on limestone bluffs and along streams to elevations of 400 m. The tree is also endemic to Nuevo León in Mexico [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2807778?seq=1].
Description.
Rarely exceeding 20 m in height, the tree has a rounded crown with spreading to pendulous branches. The glabrous young shoots become progressively corky-winged with age, and bear oblong to obovate leaves < 8 cm long. The wind-pollinated apetalous perfect flowers form pendulous racemes which open in September and serve to distinguish the species from its compatriot, the Cedar Elm "U. crassifolia", with which it readily hybridizes. The samarae are oblong - elliptical, 10 mm to 15 mm in length, deeply divided at the apex, and ripen in November [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501330]
[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ulse].
Pests and diseases.
The species is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease.
Cultivation.
Before the outbreak of Dutch elm disease, "U. serotina" enjoyed limited popularity as a shade-tree in the southern part of its range. The tree grows well on most soils but is intolerant of anaerobic or saline conditions; it is also frost-tolerant to - 30°C. (-23 F). The September Elm is very rare in cultivation in Europe, and it is not known to have been introduced to Australasia. There are no known cultivars of this taxon, nor is it known to be in commerce.

Henry Elliott Hudson

Henry Philerin Hudson (1798-1889) was an Irish Music collector.
Life.
Hudson was the son of the eminent dentist Edward and during adulthood practiced as surgeon / dentist on Grafton Street, Dublin. 
At the age of 14, Hudson transcribed the music manuscripts of Irish language teacher and lexicographer Edward O'Reilly. However, little was added to his collection until around 1840. His interest in Irish music was rekindled by a statement by collector Edward Bunting (1773-1843) to the effect that no newly composed tunes sounded characteristic of the Irish style. Hudson felt that he and others could compose melodies that sounded traditional and he began to compose sample pieces. Between 1841-43 he edited the music section of the literary magazine "The Citizen", publishing 106 tunes from his own collection. Many of the tunes he published were his own compositions but were presented as traditional melodies and given a false provenance to back them up. Hudson felt vindicated when he heard that Bunting had expressed some jealousy towards Hudson's published airs. Henry Hudson never publicly admitted to his deceit and several of his compositions appear as traditional melodies in the manuscripts and publications of other collectors. His collection numbered 870 melodies at the time of his death. In 1901 the various volumes of his manuscript collection were privately sold, though it is now publicly available at the National Library of Ireland, the Boston Public Library, and the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. Henry's brother William Elliot Hudson (1796-1853) was a barrister noted for his philanthropy and his support of the Irish language. He was also a composer and, like his brother Henry, a collector of Irish folk tunes. However, his manuscript collection does not appear to have survived.

John Cooke Bourne (September 1, 1814 – February 1896) was a British artist, engraver and photographer, best known for his lithographs showing the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway and the Great Western Railway.
His set of prints were each published as separate book, and became classic representations of the construction of the early railways. Prints were often hand coloured for a vivid picture of events.
Biography.
John Cooke Bourne was born in London, were his father worked as hat-maker in Covent Garden. He was related to the engraver George Cooke, who was his godfather, and became befriended with his son Edward William Cooke, whose uncle, William Bernard Cooke (1778–1855), was also a line engraver of note. After general education, Bourne became a pupil of the landscape engraver John Pye, who had specialised in illustrations for popular annuals and pocket-books. Bourne was further influenced by the work of Thomas Girtin and John Sell Cotman.
When early 1830s near his home the construction started for the London and Birmingham Railway, the first main-line railway to enter London, this became Bourne's major source of inspiration. In 1836 Bourne started making drawings of the construction sides as subjects of professional study. These drawings were published in 1838/39 in a book in four volumes, with an accompanying text by John Britton. Late 1840 he lithographed some drawings for Robert Hay's publication, entitled "Illustration of Cairo." Bourne continued to draw railway scenes, and in the 1840s became associate with Charles Cheffins In 1846 He commissioned Bourne to produce a series of drawings about the Great Western Railway, which connected London with the south-west and west of England and most of Wales. This led to the 1846 publication of "History of the Great Western Railway." Bourne also draw the illustrations for Bennet Woodcroft's "A sketch of the origin and progress of steam navigation from authentic documents." with were lithographed by Cheffins. 
At the end of the 1840s Bourne started working for Charles Blacker Vignoles, who was employed to construct the Nicholas Chain Bridge in Kiev over the Dnieper River. He travelled to Russia, and draw and later photographed its construction until its completion in 1853. In that year he made some pictures for the new 4th edition of Bennet Woodcroft's "A Sketch of the Origin and Progress of Steam Navigation."
Bourne kept working in Russia as artist in residence for another decade. In the year 1852 he travelled together with Roger Fenton to Moscow and St. Petersburg, which resulted in his painting of the Moscow Kremlin (see image). He stayed in Russia in total for a period of twelve years as illustrator and photographer, before returning to England.
Bourne exhibited his work in the Royal Photographic Society in 1854, the Royal Academy of Arts in 1863 and the Royal Society of British Artists in 1865. Back in England in 1866 he married Catherine Cripps, and settled in Teddington. He died in 1896 Brentford, a town in West London.
Work.
Bourne's major works were his drawings of the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway, and of the operations of the Great Western Railway, which were printed in 1838/39 and 1846. After these works he worked in Russia for over a decade.
"A Series of Lithographic Drawings on the London and Birmingham Railway", 1838.
Bourne's 1838 publications "A Series of Lithographic Drawings on the London and Birmingham Railway", showed the construction of the railway from London to Birmingham in the year 1837–38. For this work Bourne had translated his original watercolours into lithographs. It was accompanied by a text, entitled "Topographical and descriptive Accounts of the Origin, Progress, and general Execution of that great national Work", written by John Britton. Britton was known in his days from the publication "The architectural antiquities of Great Britain", which had appeared in multiple volumes since 1807. Britton (1838; p. 14) wrote about Bourne's work:
About the origin of this work Britton in his 1849 autobiography would recalled, that "some beautiful drawings of this Railway were made in the year 1838, by Mr. John C. Bourne, as studies from nature. They were submitted to Mr. Britton, who suggested the expediency of their being published. The great cuttings, embankments, and tunnels, on the London and Birmingham Railway, were, at the time referred to, matters of great novelty and absorbing interest to the inhabitants of the metropolis; and it appeared therefore certain that the beauty of Mr. Bourne's drawings, and the popularity of the subject, would ensure success in their publication."
Britton (1849) further stated about the used techniques: "On considering the best mode of multiplying the drawings, that of tinted lithography was adopted, as best calculated to preserve the spirit and character of the originals, without reducing them in size. Although Mr. Bourne had not previously made any drawings on stone, he was eminently successful even in his first efforts; and the whole of the series (thirty-seven in number) were thus executed by himself. The prints were published in four periodical parts, at one guinea each (super-royal folio). On the completion of the work, a general Historical and Descriptive Account of the Railway, occupying twenty-six printed pages, was written by Mr. Britton." 
1838 review.
One of the first reviews of this work in "The Architectural Magazine" by John Claudius Loudon, described that "the present work will comprise a series of thirty-three, or more, finished sketches, as executed by the artist on the respective spots, and transferred by himself to stone, with scrupulous fidelity. At the conclusion of the work, and with the last number, will be presented to the subscribers a brief Topographical and Descriptive Account of the Origin, Progress, and general Execution of this great national Line of Railway; with Descriptive Notices of the Scenes and Objects delineated in the different drawings."
The lithographs which will be contained in the whole work are the following:
The second part of the work will appeared in November 1838, and the two following parts at intervals of two months afterwards.
Loudon (1838) proceed: "Of the artistic merits of the lithographs, we cannot speak in too high terms; and as portraits, having passed along the whole line from London to Birmingham, they appear to us, as far as we could judge in that rapid transit, sufficiently faithful. For both these results, it is a great advantage that the same artist who made the drawings from nature should have also transferred them to stone." Britton (1838) describes in the text:
Loudon (1838) concluded that: "It is added, that they are on that account likely to gratify both. the lover of the picturesque and the man of science: the former, by variety of lines and combinations; and the latter, by different modes of application of machinery, mechanism, and manual labour."
1839 reviews.
A 1939 review in "The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal" mentioned the completion of the other two parts. It further stated, that:
The "Herapath's Railway Journal", Vol. 6 (1839) further explains: 
1840s review.
A 1840 review in "The Gentleman's Magazine" describes that the volume contains "a series of thirty-seven views of portions of the line of the Birmingham Railway, from the entrance in Euston Grove to its termination. They are executed in lithography, and tinted; and it is but justice to say, that they do great credit to the pencil of the artist. There is perhaps, no object less picturesque, or to all appearance, more incapable of producing effect, than the dull strait level of a rail-road; but in the hands of Mr. Bourne, the subject seems to have lost much of its untractable character, and by the skilful use of accessories, has turned out to be far more agreeable than at first sight it promised to have been."
The various stages of the undertaking are represented from the excavation and embankment, to the complete work. In some of the early views, the scene is varied by the bustle and life displayed by the hundreds of workmen engaged in their different avocations.
Two views of the Kilsby Tunnel are interesting; in the first "a working shaf," the powerful light bursting through the aperture in the roof, and shewing shewing the group of workmen and horses with one of the operators descending, affords a striking idea of the vastness of the Tunnel itself. "the visibleness of the ray of light from the shaft," says Mr. Britton, "is occasioned by the opaqueness and humidity of the atmosphere, arising from the want of the ventilator." In a 2008 article Mike McKiernan commented this same picture: 
According to the 1840 review another picture "the grand ventilator shaft conveys an equally good idea of the appearance of this vast passage diminishing in the distance into a mere speck. A very picturesque plate of the viaduct over the river Blythe, near the termination of the railroad, has the singular merit of displaying on opposite sides of the same view, a comparison between the ancient and modern modes of bridge building. The massive piers, further secured by buttresses and narrow arches of the ancient fort bridge, afford a curious contrast to the great altitude and extensive span with the slender supports of the modern viaduct."
Railroad problems.
Clooke had an eye for the problems that the railroad companies encountered. Clues can be seen for example in his print of Sonning Cutting where a terrible train accident had occurred in December 1842. The train had collided with a landslip and killed nine stonemasons returning from work in London to the West Country. The picture shows labourers working to clear further slips in the bank.
Another of his famous prints shows a large landslip on the London and Birmingham Railway just north of Wolverton railway works which occurred during the construction of the Wolverton viaduct over the River Ouse.
"History of the Great Western Railway", 1846.
In 1846 Bourne published his second book with a series of drawings of the Great Western Railway, that linked London with the south-west and west of England and most of Wales. The full title of this work, as advertised in a volume of the 1846 "Appleton's Literary Bulletin", was: 
The idea for this work came from the publisher and was due to the popularity of this subject. The style of the drawings were significantly different from his 1838 work on the London and Birmingham Railway. It was more impressionistic and composed in "a far more painterly way." Freeman & Aldcroft (1991) stipulated, that in this volume "the emphasis on engineering feats is reduced (presumably because the line was by then some years old), and the focus shifts more to views from the carriage window and the facilities provided by stations: the wonders of construction have given way to the pleasures and conveniences of railway travel." 
The accompanied text was written by the engineer George Thomas Clark, and in those days was discussed in multiple sources The volume of Bourne's work was reproduced in 1969.
1846 review.
A 1846 review in "The Gentleman's Magazine" on the "History of the Great Western Railway" starts explaining in general, that "he history and illustration of the great railways of the present day is a fertile theme, and one which cannot fail to excite interest, not merely amongst the individuals immediately connected with them, but with the public generally, and men of science and philosophers particularly. What were only a few years back matters of speculation and mystery are now familiarly recognized by the great mass of the reading public. In the Great Western Line many railway novelties and improvements have been effected, at once astonishing and confusing those who predicted their utter failure. It cannot but be deeply interesting to trace the origin, Uic progress, and effects of this stupendous undertaking, now that it has been for sonic years in successful operation." 
Specific about the work the review states that:
And it continues, that "he illustrative department is completed by a map and section of the line, and a geological map of the singular district in which the Great Western Railway terminates, and across which are carried, in opposite direction, its continuations towards Exeter on the one hand, and Gloucester on the other. The letter-press, besides a description of the route of the railway, of those fine architectural works, its viaducts and bridges, which, though daily crossed by thousands, are actually seen by few, and of the topography and geological features of the line, comprises a brief history of the formation of the company, whilst in an introduction the non-professional reader is made acquainted with the principles of railway construction, and the application and regulation of locomotive steam power. Tims it will be seen that every branch of the subject has received attention, and the result is the production of a volume highly creditable to all the parties concerned."
Proposed suspension bridge at Kiev, 1847.
Late 1840s Bourne started working for Charles Blacker Vignoles, who was employed to construct the Nicholas Chain Bridge in Kiev over the Dnieper River. Bourne made the following sketch, which was presented to the Tsar in 1847. The construction of the bridge started in 1848 and was completed in 1855. Bourne made drawings and later weekly photographs of every stage of its construction.
In this period Bourne also learned to make daguerreotypes, which were introduced in 1839, and calotypes, introduced in 1841. He was encouraged by Charles Blacker Vignoles, who was an amateur photographer, to used those techniques to document the further construction of the bridge. He soon came to realize, that the "photography's precise recording... would supersede drawing as a means of making topographical views" because it was less expensive, and more accurate.
Legacy.
Railroad depiction.
In the 19th century Bourne gave face to the fascination with the new railway technology. He was among the earliest artists to "integrated the depiction of railway construction into a well established landscape tradition. The rails were sometimes barely visible or coexisted with the stock landscape elements of cattle, rocks, sky, and greenery." Nowadays Bourne is considered one of the greatest railway artists, and is described by Elton as "the Piranesi of the Railway Age." According to Russell (2001) Bourne's two series of railroad scene's were the only works, that equalled the work of Thomas Shotter Boys. Burman & Stratton (1997) explained:
More in general Russell (2001) summarizes:
In his "Art and the Industrial Revolution", Klingender (1968) had enthused added: “Bourne's Great Western pictures echo the sweep and swagger of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's great broad-gauge railway...”
In his own days, however, Bourne's work had little market value, because "the art patrons of the day wished for anything rather than to be reminded of the social and technological revolution going on all round them." Also the exclusive "pictures like those of J. C. Bourne were understandably seen by a very limited stratum of society, whereas Dickens described what met the eyes of all classes..."
Lithography.
The early work of Bourne has been identified as one of the first excellent examples of the application of lithography, which was invented late 18th century. A chapter on the history of lithography described that after an initiation period early 19th century, commercial exploration of lithography started since 1818: 
Wakefield (1973, p. 37) more specifically adds, that "by the end of the 1830s it was in common use, being employed in some very attractive books like John Britton's "Drawings of the London and Birmingham Railway", 1839, with illustrations by John Cooke Bourne. It depends for its effect upon the antipathy between grease and water: a greasy image on a surface of smooth limestone is first moistened and then inked; the image repels the water but accepts the ink, while the stone accepts the water and consequently repels the ink. The image can then be printed on paper by passing stone and paper through a scraper press, which gives a picture in black on a white background. By 1837 it was becoming common practice to add the impression of another stone, printed in a straw colour to give a tinted background, and this produced what are known as tinted lithographs. In England they were developed by C.J. Hullmandel, who was the most important lithographer working in England in the earlier part of the century."
Photography.
In 1855 Bourne, with home address Holmes Terrace, Kentish Town in the County of Middlesex, was granted a patent for a new camera design, described as "Improvements in photographic apparatus." This design "allowed the lens to move in a curved slot the radius of which was the same as the focal length of the lens."

JPT Bus Company

JPT Bus Company (formerly JP Travel), was a bus company based at Middleton, Greater Manchester, England. Operations ceased on 25 April 2014, with the business taken over by Stagecoach Manchester.
History.
The company was founded in 1974 by Janet and Peter Walsh, entering the bus market in 1987. A small network of services began to form during the late 1980s under the name of "City Nippy", with the following routes being introduced within 12 months of commencing bus operations:
Since then, a network of services has developed across Manchester. Whilst concentrating on north Manchester, the company has gained a presence in the southern area through winning Transport for Greater Manchester tenders. In the past few years, expansion through this means has taken as far as Farnworth and Stockport.
An attempt to reroute service 162 to bypass North Manchester General Hospital met opposition from residents in the Alkrington area. The decision was reversed and the route was instead diverted to serve more of the Alkrington estate. 
In 2007, they took over the services then operated by Ashall's Coaches and have since taken over the routes of the former operator, "Vale Of Manchester".
Another innovation occurred in 2009, when the operator became the first on route 343, between Oldham, Mossley and Hyde, to operate low floor buses. As part of a summer promotion, in August 2009 the company halved the cost of its weekly season ticket from £10.00 to £5.00, at a time when competing major operators were cutting back on services.
In October 2009 the company was awarded the contracts for five new services in North Manchester and received a loan of £250,000 to buy new low-floor vehicles for the routes.
In 2010 Janet and Peter Walsh retired with control of the business passing to son Mark.
In January 2011, JP Travel had announced that its sister company Eurobus had acquired local coach firm known as Ellenbrook Travel. Eurobus began operating on route 17 on 15 May 2011, effectively competing against First Greater Manchester on that route. Five former Stagecoach Alexander ALX200 bodied Volvo B6LEs are used, running alongside JPT on a co-ordinated timetable. The Eurobus vehicles shared the same colour scheme (except for the Eurobus logo) as JPT. In late 2012 the Eurobus operation was wound up, with all vehicles being rebranded as JPT buses, and gaining JPT fleet numbers.
In February 2012 JPT announced that they are building a second depot to run from at the former Brookfield Mill near Middleton town centre (their current one at Middleton Junction will remain open). On 20 June 2012 JPT announced via their Facebook page that they had been awarded a Licences increase, meaning they would be able to have more buses on the road.
In January 2013 JPT decided to withdraw route 17 (except one school trip) this now left First Manchester the only company on route 17 
From September 2013 JPT decided to reinstate the route 17 only as far as Middleton, resulting in there being more competition on the route between itself and First Greater Manchester. But also now the service only runs every 20 minutes which wasn't as frequent as it was before.
However in January 2014 with increased competition from First Greater Manchester on the 17 and Stagecoach Manchester on route 112, JPT decided to again withdraw completely from the 17 route and only operate a few journey's on the 112 in the evenings under contract to Transport for Greater Manchester.
Operations ceased on 25 April 2014, with the business and 41 buses passing to Stagecoach Manchester.
Fleet.
As at February 2014, the fleet consisted of 42 buses. Fleet livery was yellow and blue.

Douglas Black (physician)

Sir Douglas Andrew Kilgour Black, (1913–2002) was a Scottish physician and medical scientist who played a key role in the development of the National Health Service. He conducted research in the field of public health and was famous as the author of the Black Report.
He was born in Shetland in 1913, educated at Forfar Academy, and studied medicine at the Bute Medical School, University of St Andrews, graduating with MB ChB in 1933.
He conducted research into water loss and dehydration, first at Oxford University, and then at the University of Manchester, where he became professor of medicine in 1959.
In 1974 he became the first chief scientist at the Department of Health and Social Security of the UK government. From 1977–1983 he was president of the Royal College of Physicians. He also served as the president of the British Medical Association and earned himself a lot of respect by taking an uncompromising stand against the apartheid regime in South Africa.
In the 1970s Black was asked by the Labour government of the UK to chair an expert committee to investigate health inequalities. The report produced by this committee, popularly known as "The Black Report" was published in 1980. Although unpopular with the then Conservative government, it has had a major impact on knowledge on the subject of health inequality since that time, and was published by Penguin Books as "Inequalities in Health: The Black Report and the Health Divide" in 1982.
Later, Black chaired the UK government investigation into childhood leukaemia around the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, UK.
Black was created a Knight Bachelor in 1973, and a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1989.

Mauro Forghieri

Mauro Forghieri (born January 13, 1935) is an Italian Formula One car designer.
Early life and Ferrari.
Forghieri was born in Modena, the only child of Reclus and Afra Forghieri. His father, a turner, did war work during World War II for the Ansaldo mechanical workshops of Naples. After the conflict, he took up work in the Ferrari workshop in Maranello.
Meanwhile, Forghieri completed the Liceo Scientifico and obtained a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bologna. Despite his initial interest in aviation design, he accepted an offer from Ferrari, where he had been introduced by his father. He became part of the racing team in 1962, with the position of Chief of the Technical Department for racing cars after the departure of Carlo Chiti.
He was later promoted to Technical Director of the Racing Department. In 1970, Forghieri designed the Ferrari 312 series (consisting of the 312 and 312B formula one cars and 312P and 312PB sportscars). Under his guidance Ferrari won the driver's F1 world championship title four times, with John Surtees (1964), Niki Lauda (1975 and 1977), and Jody Scheckter (1979). Ferrari also won the constructors F1 world championship title eight times.
Lamborghini and Bugatti.
After leaving Ferrari in 1987, Forghieri joined Lamborghini Engineering, a department created by Lee Iacocca, the then CEO of Chrysler, who had bought the Emilian car firm Lamborghini.
In that organisation, which had the ex-Ferrari Daniele Audetto as sports director, Forghieri designed the naturally aspirated Lamborghini 3512 V12 engine, which made its racing debut at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix. The V12 engine was used exclusively by the Larrousse team in the F1 season.
Following the encouraging performance of the engine, the project of designing a whole car was conceived, thanks to financing by the Mexican businessman Fernando Gonzalez Luna. The car, whose bodywork was designed by Mario Tolentino, was slated for a 1991 debut, but the day before the official presentation to the press, Gonzalez Luna disappeared with a conspicuous amount of money that had been paid by sponsors. Nevertheless, the car debuted thanks to financing by Carlo Patrucco, of the newly created Modena Team (also known as Lambo).
The latter was an unsuccessful enterprise, however, and Forghieri left Lamborghini soon afterwards. In 1992, he became the technical director of the re-emerging Bugatti, where he stayed until 1994. In the same year, he was also called as an expert in the trial relating to the death of driver Ayrton Senna on the Imola track.
Oral Engineering Group.
In 1994, Forghieri co-founded with Franco Antoniazzi and Sergio Lugli the Oral Engineering Group, a mechanical design company he still works for. Their projects there have included making the Ferrari Pinin concept car actually run.

Apedale Community Country Park

Apedale Community Country Park is a 454 acre country park in the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England. The park is unusual for the area as it was previously as an opencast mine.
The area has a long history of mining, with the nearby former collieries at Silverdale and Holditch also having been redeveloped for other uses.
The park is considered by administration as a form of compensation to the residents of the area for the large amount of development that has taken place over recent years. The shallow mine at Holditch was redeveloped into a business park and industrial estate, which led to significant capital gains for Staffordshire County Council. The amelioration of the park was part paid for out of these receipts.
Within the park is the Apedale Heritage Centre. The adjoining Moseley Railway Trust is currently running the first phase of the narrow gauge Apedale Valley Light Railway extending further into the parkland. There are a series of tracks, waymarked routes and self-guided trails.
The Country Park is also the home of Newcastle Countryside Project and is bordered by the communities of Silverdale, Chesterton, Knutton and Cross Heath.

Pollutri

Pollutri is a "comune" and town in the Province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy
<BR>
There are many legends regarding the birth of Pollutri, all the fruit of popular imagination. The most famous Lombard refers to a prince who had decided to build a country where he found a lost colt. In reality, things were a little different. In 568 the Lombards, under the leadership of King Albano, took to Italy in search of new sources of income and with a quick campaign of war occupied the north of Italy, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania and Basilicata.
At that time the hill on which Pollutri now stands was covered with thick forests and there were only a few huts of shepherds and farmers. The Lombards, soon arrived and did their utmost to integrate with the indigenous population. The village was expanded so much that in 580 it had already become very important and its territory reached to the sea, bounded by the Sinello Osento rivers. The name Pollutri derives from a temple dedicated to Pollux.
In the Middle Ages the Pollutrian territory was ruled by a royal emissary who lived in Vasto. From 1279 when King Charles came down into Italy and campaigned throughout the South, Pollutri became part of the Kingdom of Naples, from which depended politically until 1860, when Garibaldi drove out the Bourbons. In this same year, King Charles imposed heavy taxes. On 28 August 1292, The University, which was the center of civil life, elected as supreme judges of Pollutri: James Gizio, Di Stefano De Lorenzo and Roberto Fura.
From 1300 to 1600 there is a gap in the history of civil and religious life in Pollutri due to the loss of the "BOOK OF THE REFORM OF THE TOWN" and "THE BOOK OF RESOLUTIONS AND OPINIONS OF 'UNIVERSITY' Pollutri", the first of which reported news from 1313 to 1613 and the second from 1613 to 1729. These are stored in the municipal archive the "BOOK OF LIGHTING CANDLES" and the "RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY' OF Pollutri" that report news from 1729 to 1769.
However, we can not yet speak of Pollutri as a real commune because it did not have its own laws as municipalities of the north and, consequently, did not yet enjoy real independence and depended directly or indirectly on the King of Naples, who had entrusted with the government of its noble families in the area of Vasto and Monteodorisio. As mentioned, very little is known of the period of 1300 - 1600. Only the historian Nicola Faraglia in "Review of Abruzzo" (Casalbordino, Edition De Angelis, 1898, no. 5-6 page 225) gives mention of the censuses of 1447 and 1596. In 1447 it records seventy families and 353 inhabitants, and in 1596 it rose to 133 families while ignoring the exact number of population.
In 1576 Alessandro Muzio saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary, which was reported by his son Joseph, dean of Pollutri in the book one of those baptized, and those confirmed dead, preserved in the parish, and summarized by Gabriele D'Annunzio in "The Triumph of Death" (edition of Treves, Milan, pages 297-1903).
In 1669 Pollutri was part of the estate of Prince Matteo di Capua Basin. Until the descent of the Swabians, the territory of its municipality was ruled by royal emissaries. Later he joined the County Monteodorisio which had as its first feudal lord Odorisio count Marsi. The county included twelve other regions: Pennaluce, Cupello, Scerni, Casalbordino, Guildford, Villalfonsina, Lentella, Furci, Gissi, Casalanguida, Smooth Colledimezzo. The county government was subsequently entrusted to Conrad of Conrad of Antioch in Sweden, the grandson of Frederick II. With the defeat at the hands of the Swabians Anjou, the County of Monteodorisio, which as said also included the lands of Pollutri, was assigned to Boniface of Gilberto and later to Charles of Artois, Lalle Campaneschi, Louis of Taranto and the Francesco del Cozzo del Borgo who left everything to his only daughter Giovanna. She, after marrying Francesco D'Aquino, Earl of Penne, lost the county by the troops of Braccio di Montone and Sforza Attendolo.
Not long thereafter, the Earl of Penne, Francesco D'Aquino, with fresh, well-trained troops, regained Monteodorisio County, and therefore also the territory of Pollutri, which he at once gave to his niece Antonella, wife of Junichi d'Avalos, brave general of Spanish origin. From 1700 Pollutri has been tied to the line of the D'Avalos of Vasto.

Peter Richard Kenrick

Peter Richard Kenrick (August 17, 1806 – March 4, 1896) was the first Catholic archbishop west of the Mississippi River.
Early life and ordination.
He was born and educated in Dublin, and Maynooth College, Ireland and ordained to the priesthood in 1832 by Archbishop Murray of Dublin. Prior to entering the seminary he worked with and befriended James Clarence Mangan the poet. The year following his ordination he travelled with his brother, Francis Kenrick, who eventually became the head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and later the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore.
In his early years as a priest in Philadelphia, Father Kenrick wrote several works relating to Catholic theology and church history. One of his works, 'Validity of Anglican Ordinations examined', published in 1841, was not challenged for over a century. He held a number of posts in the Philadelphia church, until he was appointed coadjutor bishop of St. Louis, Missouri in 1841. At the time, the diocese included the entire area of the Louisiana Purchase, except for Iowa, Louisiana, and Minnesota. In 1847, when the diocese became an archdiocese, he became the first archbishop of the newly created archdiocese. The city itself would grow almost thirtyfold over the term of his residency.
Bishop.
During his tenure in St. Louis, he visited many parts of the state of Missouri and actively encouraged the development of Catholicism and Catholic institutions in his diocese. He started a Catholic journal, opened a seminary in the then-independent city of Carondelet, Missouri, and invited a number of Roman Catholic religious institutes to work in the diocese.
During the period of the American Civil War and its aftermath, Kenrick maintained a neutral position in a city and state whose residents were of widely divergent opinions on the matter. After the war ended, he urged the priests in his diocese to refuse to take the ironclad oath which was intended to ensure that no person who had supported the Confederate position would ever achieve a position of influence, and supported those who did so. One of these priests, the Reverend John A. Cummings, filed the case which the United States Supreme Court heard and prompted them to rule the ironclad oath unconstitutional.
He took part in the second Plenary Council of Baltimore, where he advocated that the affairs of the Catholic Church in the United States be handled locally wherever possible. This position earned him a number of detractors and opponents. During the First Vatican Council, he opposed the centralization of church authority in Rome and did not support the declaration of the dogma of Papal infallibility. When it was defined dogmatically, he accepted the opinion of the majority. His failure to support this issue increased the number and prominence of his detractors.
Later life.
After harassment by his detractors and members of the curia made life difficult for him, he turned over the administration of the archdiocese to his coadjutor bishop, Patrick John Ryan, in 1871. Upon Ryan being made the Archbishop of Philadelphia, the diocese which Kenrick's brother had previously headed, Kenrick took back active administration of his diocese.
During the period when the Knights of Labor, a strongly Roman Catholic labor union and the first national labor union, turned to violence, Kenrick vocally opposed them and condemned their actions. However, the higher-ranking Cardinal James Gibbons, the Archbishop of Baltimore, overruled his objections.
In 1893, Kenrick's attempt to name his coadjutor bishop failed when his nominee did not win the support of his fellow bishops. John Joseph Kain was appointed to fill the role instead. His conflicts and failed communication with Kain lent a note of discord to his final years.
In 1896, he was canonically deposed by Pope Leo XIII because of physical incapacitation due to infirmity (cf canon 401).
He died on March 4, 1896, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, which is a cemetery Kenrick had himself established on a farm he bought. The seminary of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, formerly known as Kenrick Theological Seminary, is named in his honor.

SooperDooperLooper

The SooperDooperLooper is a ride at Hersheypark. It was designed as a terrain coaster by Werner Stengel, and built by Anton Schwarzkopf.
Rider Experience.
The train first goes up a hill, takes a small drop of about 5 feet, turns left, climbs it again by force, not by chain, and then descends and enters a loop. It then makes a sweeping left turn that travels through the middle of the loop and enters a tunnel. The ride concludes with a series of bunny hills and helixes. The trains on the SooperDooperLooper use a single lap bar to hold riders in the seat. This design works because the forces from the loop (and helix) press riders in their seats, and are a common feature with looping coasters. The tunnel that occurs part-way through the ride used to house a mechanical spider prop that would drop down towards the train. The ride opened with three trains. It now currently runs with two.
Additional Information.
The ride was considered a "walk-on" by enthusiasts due to lines normally not exceeding 2–3 minutes, until the ride received two new trains in the year 2012.
SooperDooperLooper is located in the Hollow section of the park, across from Skyrush.
In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme (Hersheypark in the Dark), the SooperDooperLooper is dubbed the SooperBOOperLooper.
For the 2012 season the original Schwarzkopf trains were replaced by trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. The trains were installed by Ride Entertainment Group, who handles all of Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere. The brakes were also replaced with a magnetic braking system.

Art Houtteman

Arthur Joseph Houtteman (August 7, 1927 – May 6, 2003) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for 12 seasons in the American League with the Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles. In 325 career games, Houtteman pitched 1,555 innings and posted a win-loss record of 87–91, with 78 complete games, 14 shutouts, and a 4.14 earned run average (ERA).
Known on the sandlot for his pitching motion, Houtteman was signed by scout Wish Egan in 1945 at 17 years of age. He was recruited by major league teams, and joined a Tigers pitching staff that had lost players to injuries and World War II. After moving between the major and minor leagues over the next few years, he was nearly killed in an automobile accident just before the 1949 season. Houtteman rebounded from his injuries and went on to win 15 games that season and made his only All-Star appearance in the following year.
He played three more seasons with the Tigers, then was sold to Cleveland, where he pitched for the pennant-winning Indians during their 1954 season. After losing his starting job, he played two more seasons with the Indians before he was bought by the Orioles, and he finished his final season in Major League Baseball with them. Houtteman ended his baseball career in the minor leagues and became a sales executive in Detroit. In 2003, Houtteman died at the age of 75.
Early life.
Art Houtteman was born in Detroit, Michigan, on August 7, 1927. He was a second-generation American citizen; his grandfather Joseph had emigrated from Belgium. The only son born to the Houtteman family, Art's father, also named Arthur, vowed that his son would become a major league player by the time he turned 17.
Houtteman played baseball at Detroit Catholic Central High School, where his pitching caught the attention of baseball scout Wish Egan, who praised Houtteman's "perfect pitching motion". Houtteman was signed by the Detroit Tigers late in 1944 and began to practice with the Tigers in spring training before the 1945 season along with fellow Detroit sandlot player Billy Pierce. He spent most of the 1945 season playing for Detroit's top minor league affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. But injuries plagued the Tigers' pitching staff, and the 17-year-old Houtteman was called up by the parent club and began his major league career.
Detroit Tigers.
Hard Luck Houtteman.
Due to Tiger pitching injuries, and with many top players still in the military late in World War II (Houtteman was too young for the draft), he made his major league debut on April 29. At 17 years old, he was the youngest player in the American League in the 1945 season before being optioned back to Buffalo, where on June 20 he threw seven no-hit innings, facing only 22 batters in the process, but lost the game 2–0 in extra innings. He also appeared in 13 games as a relief pitcher, and finished his minor league season with no wins, two losses and an ERA of 5.33 in just over 25 innings pitched. He was not on the active roster, and as a result did not pitch during the Tigers' World Series victory over the Chicago Cubs.
Houtteman was the youngest major leaguer in 1946 but played only one game for the Tigers that season, allowing eight runs and fifteen hits in eight innings. He spent most of 1946 in the minor leagues, finished at 16–13 and led the league in strikeouts. At the end of the season, Houtteman was named by six of the eight International League managers as the top pitching prospect in the league, leading the league in strikeouts with 150, pitching over 200 innings, finishing second in victories with 16, and amassing an 11–2 road record. Minor league third baseman Johnny Bero liked Houtteman's fielding ability so much that he called him "a fifth infielder."
Despite his newfound top prospect status Houtteman remained in Buffalo at the beginning of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the bullpen for a time, and saw little action. But after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were used in two days, Tiger manager Steve O'Neill decided to start Houtteman against the Washington Senators for only the second start of his career. He tossed a five-hit shutout and Tiger general manager Billy Evans said, "In 40 years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the Boston Red Sox, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".
The 1948 Detroit Tigers season began with Houtteman in the starting rotation. Things started off poorly, however, as Houtteman lost his first eight decisions. Two of the first five losses, though, were by one run, and he had little run support. The 0–8 start and lack of run support led to his being called "Hard Luck Houtteman" in the media. His first victory that year came against the Senators, in which he also drove in the winning run. After winning his next start, he defeated the Philadelphia Athletics allowing only five hits, and avoided another loss. But he then lost eight more games and finished the season at 2–16. His teammates and the media attributed this to bad luck rather than bad pitching, and still regarded him as a prime prospect. Newhouser said, "The kid has had nothing but bad luck since the season opened", while Fred Hutchinson said, "He shouldn't have lost more than three or four games had he gotten an even break". But his 4.66 ERA was only 0.06 higher than the major league average.
As 1949 spring training began, Houtteman was nearly killed. In Lakeland, Florida on March 10, while driving home from Florida Southern College, he crashed into a fruit truck fracturing his skull. Originally listed in critical condition (a priest stood by to administer the last rites in extremis), he recovered rapidly and was able to talk with his teammates two days after the accident, telling them, "I'll be able to pitch sooner than you". Within two weeks, the Tigers were optimistic that Houtteman would be able to play again by June. As a result of the injuries to Houtteman and Yankee star catcher Yogi Berra due to car accidents, Cleveland Indians playing manager Lou Boudreau banned his players from driving, forcing the soon-to-be world champions to ride chartered buses to exhibition games.
Ace of the staff.
Houtteman marked his return to the Tigers' rotation on May 21, 1949, but he lost his first three decisions. His performance improved, however, as he began to earn more victories in the 1949 season. These wins included a five-hit 2–1 victory over the New York Yankees on July 23. Over the course of the season, Houtteman beat each American League club at least once and beat the Yankees and Red Sox three times. He finished the season with a 15–10 record, a 3.71 ERA, 13 complete games, and two shutouts. He was placed in most valuable player (MVP) voting, and received three points and finished tied for 22nd with teammate Virgil Trucks. The Philadelphia Sports Writers Association honored him as the year's "Most Courageous Athlete" because of his injury and comeback.
As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman was on a high note, pitching all of spring training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth game of the season on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, "I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after some of the things that have happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning which made the game go to extra innings.
Houtteman continued his successful season in the second half. On August 19, he faced the Browns and pitched a one-hitter, and faced the minimum 27 batters in the process. Houtteman ended the season just short of Ted Gray's prediction of 20 victories, and finished the season with a 19–12 record. He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in games started with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21. His ERA of 3.54 was good for fifth in the American League. He also earned six points in MVP voting, and finished tied for 24th. On October 2, the day after the 1950 season ended, Houtteman married Shelagh Marie Kelly. They met in New York's Catskill Mountains at Grossinger's Resort.
Military and return to Tigers.
Before the start of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had originally been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, "I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.
When he returned to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than year's Tigers' team". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number 21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.
It appeared that "Hard Luck Houtteman" had returned as the 1952 Detroit Tigers season began. On April 2, 1952, just before the season started, Art lost his seven-month old daughter in an automobile accident. In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Houtteman was one out away from a no-hitter when he threw a fastball that was "supposed to sink" but did not, which Harry hit for a single. Houtteman said, "This was the only pitch I shook Ginsberg off the whole game", and for years afterwards, catcher Joe Ginsberg repeatedly said to Houtteman, "If you'd listened to me, I'd have you in the Hall of Fame". Detroit won the game by a score of 13–0. After losing his tenth game on June 22, manager Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen. He finished the year with an 8–20 record and a 4.36 ERA. His 20th loss came on September 21 against the Indians, and he became the first Tiger to lose 20 games since Bobo Newsom in 1941. His disappointing season led to the possibility of a trade, with general manager Charlie Gehringer acknowledging that Houtteman might be traded if the right offer came along.
Houtteman spent the offseason selling cars and making public appearances for the Detroit Tigers. During the 1953 Detroit Tigers season there were rumors of possible trades for Houtteman, with the Yankees proposing the possibility of trading Hank Bauer, an infielder, and Gil McDougald for Houtteman. Gehringer said of Houtteman's high trading price, "Art has always had good stuff—much too good to be a 20-game loser". That season, he was used as both a starter and reliever during the season. However, he lost six straight decisions, and by the middle of June had a 2–6 record and a 5.90 ERA. This marked the end of his career as a Tiger.
Cleveland Indians.
On June 15, 1953, Houtteman was traded by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik. In July 1953, he returned to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted he wanted to be traded. He said, "The fans are down on me and I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach Mel Harder doing a "complete" overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace Bob Feller. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.
At the start of the 1954 Cleveland Indians season, Houtteman's second daughter, Hollis Ann, was born on February 22. His pitching continued to improve under Mel Harder, who "got me to quit experimenting and to seek my natural delivery". The Indians used him when they could, especially in extra inning affairs. In the Indians' first six extra inning games, Houtteman was used three times. As a result, Houtteman finished the season with a career-high 11 complete games. The Indians also began to use Houtteman and Feller for doubleheaders with great success, as they had a 9–1 record after their first five doubleheaders. Houtteman finished the season with a 15–7 record, a 3.35 ERA, and 188 innings pitched. In the 1954 World Series with the Indians, he pitched two innings in Game 3 against the New York Giants, allowing one run and striking out one batter.
The 1955 Cleveland Indians season originally planned to use Houtteman as the number four pitcher on the starting rotation, as he had been the previous year. He saw himself remaining the fourth starter, and said, "Herb Score won't beat me out of the fourth starting job with the Indians" on April 11. However, he became a spot starter, as he lost his starting position to Score, the "most talked-about rookie in all the major league training camps". He split starting time with Bob Feller and finished the season with a 10–6 record, a 3.98 ERA, and three complete games. On December 29, 1955, Houtteman's first son, Jeff, was born with assistance from National Football League player Leon Hart, who was visiting Houtteman and helped deliver the baby.
Houtteman remained a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the Chicago White Sox were willing to trade outfielder Jim Rivera for him. A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again becoming part of the White Sox along with George Strickland was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.
As the 1957 Cleveland Indians season neared, tension was running high. There was talk about Houtteman's being "in the doghouse", or out of favor with the team's management, during the 1956 season due to his lack of starts. According to sportswriter Hal Lebovitz, this was a result of the starting five for the Indians, including spot starter Feller, pitching very well during spring training. Houtteman was again brought up in trade rumors, along with Mike Garcia, since the Indians were loaded with pitching talent. When manager Al Lopez was replaced by Kerby Farrell, Houtteman did, in fact, land in Farrell's doghouse. Farrell called him out front of his teammates after a poor performance in spring training. Houtteman pitched only four innings in three games for the Indians in 1957.
Baltimore Orioles and minor leagues.
Houtteman was put on the trading block before the 1957 season, but he drew no serious offers because Cleveland seemed desperate to trade him. On May 20, after playing three games for the Indians, Houtteman was sold to the Baltimore Orioles for an undisclosed amount. Hal Lebovitz called Houtteman "a pitcher of considerable promise but who somehow has yet to cash in on it", despite the fact that he was in his 12th and final major league season. During the 1957 Baltimore Orioles season, Houtteman made four relief appearances before he was demoted to the Vancouver Mounties of the Pacific Coast League. He was brought back up to the major league roster to pitch on September 22, the final start of his major league career. In his final game, he pitched 2⅓ innings, allowing three runs on seven hits and throwing two strikeouts.
Just before the 1958 season began, Houtteman was cut by the Orioles, ending his major league career. Shortly after being cut, he signed on with the Charleston Senators, a farm club of the Tigers. He had a 3.25 ERA and a 7–9 record for the Senators at the end of the 1958 season. In 1959, the Kansas City Athletics decided to give him a tryout. However, despite what was described as an "impressive" performance, they cut Houtteman as they were looking for more youthful arms. Houtteman signed with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, and posted a 6–9 record with an ERA of 3.69 for the season. After the season ended, and after a third daughter, Sharon, was born in 1959, Houtteman announced his retirement from baseball at the age of 32.
Later life.
After retiring from professional baseball, Houtteman kept baseball a part of his life and became a sports reporter for a television station in Detroit for a time. He later became a sales executive with Paragon Steel in Detroit, where he worked until reaching the age of retirement. He was in attendance for the last game at Tiger Stadium in 1999. Houtteman died on May 6, 2003, at the age of 75, of an apparent heart attack at his home in Rochester Hills, Michigan. He was survived by his wife, three children, and six grandchildren.

Oz Before the Rainbow

Oz Before the Rainbow is a book written by Mark Evan Swartz in 2000 chronicling the early stage and film versions of "The Wizard of Oz", before the 1939 movie, as well as an album featuring music from the early stage versions.
Half of the book is devoted to the 1902 stage musical of "The Wizard of Oz" that Baum adapted from his book, with substantial revisions by the director and producer. The adaptation was a tremendous success, first in Chicago, then on Broadway, where it ran for two years, and then on tour for an additional seven years. It starred the comedy team of David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone as the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow. The production was a lavish extravaganza. Swartz explores how this production influenced stage and film adaptations that followed, including the 1939 MGM movie.
The book also discusses Baum's 1908 "Fairylogue and Radio-Plays", a presentation narrated by Baum, involving live action, slides and silent film, which included stories from Baum's original book and from its first two sequels, "The Marvelous Land of Oz" and "Ozma of Oz". Among other adaptations, the book also discusses the 1910, 1914 and 1925 silent film adaptations (the latter with Oliver Hardy as the Tin Woodman), some of which used material from other Oz books. In 1913, another stage version, adapted from "Ozma of Oz" was "The Woggle-Bug", which itself was adapted into "Tik-Tok of Oz". The book contains numerous illustrations, advertisements, photos from many of the versions, program covers, posters and sheet music. It goes into great detail about performers, staging and designs. The book notes that, despite many attempts, Baum was unable to repeat the extraordinary stage success of the 1902 musical and its revivals, although some of the adaptations were then turned into successful novels. He notes, however, that the various versions influenced each other and led to the 1939 MGM movie.

Premise.
The show was named for the twin masted yacht, "Westwind". The plot of the show concentrated on a scientist/photographer couple and their two teenage children sailing around the islands of the Pacific, finding danger and adventure.
Production.
The show was known for its lush photography on land and underwater by Lamar Borem. Borem was the photographer for the television series Flipper. The show was filmed in Hawaii. The show's introduction was narrated by voice actor, Paul Frees. The show was produced by "William P. D'Angelo Productions", who were responsible for another NBC live-action children's drama, Run, Joe, Run. The show did moderately well in terms of ratings but was canceled because of high production costs as compared to the standard production cost of the other Saturday morning cartoons.
Network censors demanded that no clevage should be shown for girls wearing bikinis. The show's producers added inserts to the bikini tops that ended up drawing more attention to the girl's chests.

Francavilla al Mare is a "comune" and town in the Province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy.
The area was inhabited since prehistory, and early remains have been found at St. Cecilia. In 1162 the village was granted immunity from taxes for 12 years, and this episode also gave origin to the name "Francavilla" (meaning "free town"). The harbour was a flourishing commercial key point in the Adriatic Sea, but in the 16th century was plundered by Turkish troops. The town was held by families such as the Caracciolo and D'Avalos in the following centuries. In the late 19th century Francavilla was already a well known seaside resort and the seat of an artistic literary circle with relevant figures as Francesco Paolo Michetti, Gabriele D'Annunzio, F.P. Tosti, who met at the "Conventino", in the former monastery of Santa Maria di Gesù.

Mike O'Koren

Michael F. "Mike" O'Koren (born February 7, 1958) is currently an assistant basketball coach at Rutgers University under Eddie Jordan. Also a retired American professional basketball player, a former associate head coach of the Washington Wizards from 2005 to 2008, and a former assistant coach with the New Jersey Nets from 1999 to 2003. He was selected by the New Jersey Nets in the first round (6th overall) of the 1980 NBA Draft. A 6'7" small forward from the University of North Carolina, O'Koren played in the NBA from 1980 to 1988, with the Nets and Washington Bullets. O'Koren went to Hudson Catholic Regional High School in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Youth.
O'Koren honed his basketball skills on the asphalt schoolyards of Jersey City and played his high school ball under the tutelage of coach "Rocky" Pope. At Hudson Catholic, O'Koren was a teammate of Jim Spanarkel, who went on to play point guard at Duke, then in the NBA for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Dallas Mavericks.
College.
On a talent-laden 1977 UNC team as a freshman he averaged 13.9 points per game, scored 21 points against Duke in the ACC championship game and had 31 in the NCAA semi-finals against UNLV. As a sophomore his scoring rose to 17.8. He scored in double figures every game and was second nationally with a 64.3 field goal percentage.
In 1979, Carolina was picked to finish third or lower in all the 1979 ACC pre-season polls. But, Dudley Bradley, the nation's best defensive player, and Al Wood, one of the top shooters in the college game, each improved their play on the opposite ends of the court. With O'Koren already proven as a fine all-around player, the Tar Heels posted a 23-6 record, tied for first place in the league's regular-season race, swept the ACC Tournament and finished third nationally in the final coaches' poll.
O'Koren was at his best in the biggest games. He grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds, scored 17 points, handed out seven assists and had four steals in a 74-68 homecourt win over Duke. He also held Gene Banks scoreless in the second half of that game. He finished with 22 points and five assists in a double overtime win over Virginia. In the ACC Tournament finals against Duke he had 18 points and 11 rebounds. He scored Carolina's final 10 points that day in a 71-63 victory.
As of 2013, O'Koren is the only player in North Carolina history to have scored at least 1,500 points (1,765), 800 rebounds (815) and 300 assists (348). He also had 183 steals and a career field goal percentage of 57.2.
Professional playing career.
In his NBA career, O'Koren played in 407 games and scored a total of 3,355 points. His best year as a professional came during the 1981–82 season as a member of the Nets, appearing in 80 games and averaging 11.4 ppg.

Renault Energy engine

The Energy engine also known as "E engine" or "E-Type" is an automotive gasoline four-stroke internal combustion engine, 4 cylinders in line with a sleeved water cooled cast iron block, equipped with 5 crankshaft bearings, an overhead camshaft driven by a toothed timing belt and an aluminum cylinder head with 8 OHV. Developed and produced by Renault in the late '80s, making its appearance on the Renault 19.
History.
In the late 80s, the Cleon-Fonte engine still fitted to the R4, Super 5, R9, R11, Express ... was getting old with its lateral camshaft design. Competing brands were mostly building modern engines with overhead camshafts. The Cleon-Fonte engine appeared in 1962 on the Renault 8 and Renault Floride . To launch the successor of the R9 and R11, the R19, Renault would develop a more modern engine . Renault modernized its old Cleon-Fonte motor with a new hemispheric cylinder head and an overhead camshaft, driven by a toothed timing belt, which give rise to the motor Energy in 1988. This new engine will also equip the Clio 1, Mégane 1 and even Express. But in 1993, launching the Renault Twingo, Renault will have to re-use the Cleon-Fonte engine because the "E engine", by its size with its hemispherical cylinder head and front exhaust, could not go under the hood of the little Twingo. The Energy ( E7F ) will gradually replaced the current engine D7F in 1996 on the Clio, following new standards of pollution control and high fuel consumption compared to other modern engines. The D7F engine will simultaneously replace the engines of Clio 1.2 Energy and the Twingo 1.2 Cleon-Fonte.
As for the 1.4 Energy ( E7J ) of the Megane 1, it will be replaced by the K7J engine.
Evolution Engine.
The Energy engine evolve into the K engine that will appear on the Megane 1. The main modification of the engine is operated at K machining cylinder, since this engine has removable liners. The head of Energy engine is kept on versions 8 valves species. The K engine will also be developed in 16-valve versions and will also be available in diesel version (K9K - 1.5 dCi).
ExF.
The ExF displaces 1.2 L (). The E5F is carbureted while the E7F has an electronically controlled single-point fuel injection coupled to a catalytic converter. Output ranges between depending on model year and application.

Speed is affected not only by weight on the train, but by weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc.), maintenance, the lifts' speeds, and placement of riders on train. Like most GCI coasters, both sides of the Lightning Racer's first drops curve as a way to decrease the chances of nausea, and both coasters contain an on-ride camera, located in the tunnel midway through the ride.
In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme (Hersheypark in the Dark), Thunder and Lightning are renamed Mischief and Mayhem, respectively. The ride is also dubbed "Wicked Racer" for the occasion.
Additional Information.
Lightning Racer is in the Midway America section of the park. It is the most popular attraction in that section, often dispatching full trains on the average day. Despite this, wait times for the ride often do not exceed fifteen to twenty minutes when both trains are running on each track due to high capacity and ease of dispatch. If only one train is operating on each track wait times can reach up to one hour.
When Lightning Racer opened, it was the second GCI coaster to open at Hersheypark after Wildcat, making it the only park in the world to have two GCI coasters.
During its initial season and several seasons thereafter, the ride featured Creed's hit "Higher" as its theme song. 
Awards.
Lightning Racer is a consistently voted a top 25 wooden roller coaster by "Amusement Today"'s Golden Ticket Awards.
Note: Mitch Hawker's poll lists Lightning Racer as two separate coasters (for the Lightning and Thunder sides). Every year the poll has been run, Lightning has received a higher ranking. The results above are for Lightning.

Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)

The Flying Dutchman, or simply referred to as the Dutchman, is a fictional ship in Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean". The ship made its first appearance in "" under the command of the fictional captain, Davy Jones. The story and attributes of the ship were inspired by the actual "Flying Dutchman" of nautical lore.
During filming, Johnny Depp referred to it as "the Davy Jones Crocodile Machine" after forgetting its actual name.
Background.
As explained in the movie, the character of Davy Jones was given the "Flying Dutchman" by Calypso, his lover, to ferry souls lost at sea to the afterlife. When she neglected to meet him after his first ten years of duty, he was both heartbroken and enraged. He abandoned his duties and chose to wander the seas, doing as he pleased. This violation of his duty placed a curse on Jones and his crew, slowly transforming them into monsters. Apparently, the "Dutchman" is also believed to be nautical lore in the "Pirates" universe, as character James Norrington mockingly remarks, "Jones...captain of the "Flying Dutchman?"." The fictional "Dutchman" is also known as a fearful ship to those who are superstitious, and able to destroy any vessel (using the Kraken).
Appearances.
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest".
In "", the "Dutchman" makes its first appearance when it rises from the sea to claim its victims' souls following a Kraken attack (instigated by Davy Jones). The "Dutchman", able to sail on the sea and underwater, emits terror and potency to those unfortunate enough to cross its path. Davy Jones captures from the ship wreckage and demands that Jack Sparrow settle his overdue debt. Sparrow bargains for his life, and Jones finally agrees to accept 100 souls in exchange for Sparrow's, keeping Turner as "a good faith payment".
Will is reunited with his father, "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, who is an indentured sailor aboard the "Flying Dutchman". Shipboard life is harsh, and the crew is often whipped by the cruel boatswain, Jimmy Legs. Will is also flogged, although it is his father who delivers the lash to spare his son from the boatswain's sadistic hand. With his father's help, Will escapes the "Dutchman", but when the ship he reaches is attacked by the Kraken, he sneaks back aboard as a stowaway, making his way to Isla Cruces where Jones' heart is buried in the Dead Man's Chest. Will finds Elizabeth and Sparrow on Isla Cruces. The three escape the island on the "Black Pearl", pursued by the Dutchman (who loses the "Pearl" in less than a minute). Jones unleashes the Kraken, which attacks the "Pearl" and drags Sparrow to Davy Jones' Locker.
"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End".
In "", Captain Davy Jones now serves Lord Cutler Beckett, who possesses Jones' heart and forcibly controls him and the "Flying Dutchman", which is first seen rising from the sea, mercilessly destroying pirate ships with its powerful cannons. This irritates Lord Beckett who wants survivors to interrogate, so to ensure Jones does as he is ordered to. Beckett places Admiral James Norrington and a squad of East India Trading company marines and the Dead Man's chest placed on board as well to remind Jones he is under their control. The "Dutchman" accompanies Beckett's flagship, "Endeavour" in its mission to eradicate piracy. When the "Dutchman" attacks Sao Feng's ship, the "Empress", it takes its crew captive (including Elizabeth Swann who is made captain by the dying Sao Feng). Elizabeth and her crew escape the "Dutchman" with Admiral Norrington's help, although he is killed by a deranged Bootstrap Bill Turner. Jones and his crew attempt a mutiny against the East India Trading Company marines stationed on board, but Mr. Mercer, Beckett's henchman, proclaims the ship is under his command, temporarily subduing the uprising.
The "Dutchman" leads the East India Trading Company armada in battle against the Brethren Court. The "Dutchman" and the "Black Pearl" engage in battle while entering a monstrous maelstrom (caused by Calypso, Jones' ex-lover). Jones is killed when, aided by Sparrow, the mortally wounded Will Turner stabs Jones' heart, and Jones falls off board into the maelstrom. The "Dutchman" is also sucked into the maelstrom as Swann and Sparrow escape. The "Dutchman" 's crew carve out the now-dead Will Turner's heart (as whoever kills the "Dutchman's" captain must replace him) and place it in the Dead Man's Chest. The "Dutchman" re-emerges from the maelstrom with "Captain" Will Turner at the helm. Joining forces with the "Pearl", the two ships face off against the "Endeavour". Stunned by this unexpected alliance, Beckett is unable to respond, and his crew abandons ship just as the "Endeavour" is being destroyed and Beckett is killed.
The "Dutchman" 's crew revert to human form and the ship reverts to its original form as well, and Will and Elizabeth meet on an island and consummate their marriage. Will departs at sunset to fulfill his destiny as the "Dutchman's" captain, leaving his disembodied heart in Elizabeth's care. Will frees Bootstrap Bill from his servitude, but Bootstrap decides to remain with his son as part of his new crew. Following the end credits: ten years later, the "Dutchman" reappears upon the horizon amid a green flash as Elizabeth and her son await its arrival. And as sun sets, he is seen with the ship.
Attributes.
Characteristics and armament.
The look of the fictional ship was inspired by the seventeenth century Dutch "fluyt" vessels and the "Vasa", a real-life Swedish warship which sank in 1628. However, the ship itself resembles a sailfish. The "Flying Dutchman" has five staysails making it easier to sail against the wind than running before the wind. The ship is more organic plant matter than timber and sail, heavily encrusted with marine life that reflects its strong ties to the sea. This may be the result of the fictitious "Dutchman" often being submerged. Also, it is apparently a result of the curse that turned the crew into monsters as when broken with Davy Jones' death, the ship itself loses all of the marine life attached to it and reverts to its original form like its crew does.
The fictional "Flying Dutchman" is very heavily armed with port and starboard guns. It carries 46 broadside guns, 23 on each side; 18 twenty-four pound cannons are located on the main deck, 20 thirty-six pounders on the gun deck, and 8 six pounders on the upper deck: 4 on the quarter-deck and 4 on the forecastle. The gunports on the gun deck are in the shape of demon faces, each one with a unique facial expression, with the ports appearing at the mouths. Its full broadside contains 23 cannonballs, called shot, and weighs 600 lbs. (272.155 kg). On the bow however, she mounts a pair of bow chasers, each in the form of a triple-barreled culverin, giving her an incredible range during a chase. Both triple guns fire eighteen pound cannonballs. Each separate barrel fires individually, but the trio rotates to present a fresh barrel to fire again in the style of a Gatling gun. The empty barrel can then be reloaded for its next turn. This enables the "Flying Dutchman" to continually fire at ships it is pursuing. When not in use, the bow chasers are concealed behind two doors carved in the shape of an angry demon's maw. A picture of the "Dutchman's" stern shown in the "Essential Guide to Pirates of the Caribbean" also depicts two stern gun-ports, but it is unknown what kind of guns comprise this pair.
In addition to her overwhelming firepower, the "Flying Dutchman" also has the Kraken Hammer, a massive hammer in the form of a capstan to summon the mighty Kraken. The Kraken can also be summoned by the "Black Spot". Any member of Davy Jones' crew can deliver the mark to a victim, but only Jones can remove it. 
The "Flying Dutchman" is supposedly the "fastest ship" in the Caribbean, however the only ship that can surpass the "Dutchman" for speed is the "Black Pearl".
Life aboard.
Similarly, because Jones abandoned his soul-ferrying duty, he and the crew bear a curse that gradually mutates them into anthropomorphic amalgamations of sea creatures. In the "" DVD commentary, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio mention that the crew actually become less and less human until they are literally absorbed into the "Flying Dutchman" (Davy Jones knows this, but fails to inform new recruits). One character, Wyvern, is so transformed that he is now integrated into the ship's hull. The crew has little or no human flesh remaining on them, although newer members, like Bootstrap Bill, are only partially encrusted with sea life.
Nearly all the crew members' time in servitude is spent toiling on board the ship. For amusement, the crew play a game called Liar's Dice, in which they gamble years of service. In one scene of ", the crew works on well into the night, and even in the rain, while Davy Jones plays on with his pipe organ. When Will is wrongly blamed for causing a work disruption, the boatswain proclaims that he is to be punished with a whip. In a later scene, the crew is excited when Jones commands the ship to submerge, and others continue on their duties unhampered. However, it is likely that, as Will is now captain, things have changed on board the ship, and after he becomes captain, the crew are all returned to human form, and Will grants them voluntary leave from the ship. Only his father, Bootstrap Bill, appears to remain on as crew.

The Renault R25 was the Formula One car entered by Renault in the 2005 season.The car won both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships in 2005, the first titles for any car racing with a French licence since the Matra MS80's triumph in 1969.
During the season, the car turned out to be slower than the McLaren MP4-20 at numerous points, with the win tally being 8-10. Reliability and consistency prevailed in the end, with Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella taking the car to the last win and titles for a V10 powered Formula one car, marking the end of an era.
This car also claimed Michelin's first (and also second-to-last) title since its return in Formula One, winning the title again with Renault (the R26 2006-spec car) in the 2006 season, the last for the French tyre maker. The R25 was the first constructors championship winning car since 1991 not to have been designed by either Adrian Newey or Rory Byrne.
Over 19 races, it scored 191 points, 8 wins, 15 podiums and was fully out of the points only once in 18 starts (not counting the United States Grand Prix where both Renault drivers, in common with all their fellow Michelin tyre runners, withdrew prior to starting).
In Episode 8 of Series 10 of the BBC show "Top Gear", presenter Richard Hammond drove the R25 around Stowe Circuit at Silverstone, completing two laps.

H. B. Hollins

Harry Bowly "H. B." Hollins (1854 – February 24, 1938) was an American financier, banker, and railroad magnate. He was responsible for organizing the banking and brokerage firm bearing his name, H.B. Hollins & Co. in 1878.
Life and business.
He was born to Francis Hollins and Elizabeth Coles Morris. Hollins, a native New Yorker educated in private schools, was married to socialite Evelina Merseole Knapp on January 25, 1877. The couple had four sons, Harry B. Jr., McKim (Kim), John K. (Jack), Gerald Vanderbilt, and a daughter, Marion. Colloquially known as HBH or HB. He was notable in New York society life. Members of the Hollins family were socially prominent figures and were regularly mentioned in the "New York Times" social diary. 
Hollins resided between Manhattan at his multiple town residences and at his country estate, Meadow Farm in East Islip, Long Island. Hollins entertained family and friends at Meadow Farm each summer and early autumn; these renowned guests to summer at the estate included Hollins' friend, the future King Edward VIII. Meadow Farm is also believed to be the birthplace of his children. His family's residences, mainly the East Islip mansion were said to contain many valuable paintings and rare objects of art.
Hollins began business as a marine insurance broker, and became a banker in 1888. At one time he was a partner of Fernando Iznaga, whose sister Maria Consuelo Iznaga Clement was the Dowager Duchess of Manchester. In fact, he was along with close friend William K. Vanderbilt, the executors of Iznaga's will. Along with Eugene Zimmerman of Cincinnati, Ohio, the father of the Duchess of Manchester, had owned an interest in a number of properties in the Midwest. These properties included Superior Colliery Company and Superior Development Company.
J. P. Morgan and H. B. Hollins were also business partners and the closest of friends until the former's death. In fact Morgan's offices were located across the street from H. B. Hollins & Co.'s exclusive banking offices, at the southwest corner of Wall and Broad Streets. On November 13, 1913, H.B. Hollins & Co., one of Wall Street's most highly regarded houses failed in debt of $5,000,000. The failure of the house was related to a number of issues including the Company letting their Stock Exchange business go adrift, paying more attention to floatation of new companies and to banking operations in addition to their expenses boring them down. After the news of the firm failure had spread through the financial district, Hollin's attorney's Beekman, Menken & Griscom released a press statement downplaying the collapse:
A large portion of the securities was understood on the Street to represent a number of companies in Mexico that were adversely impacted by political turmoil south of the border at the time. These enterprises were thought to include Mexican Crude Oil, Asphaltic Products Company, and United States Asphalt Company. Harry B. Hollins belonged to the Union Metropolitan, South Side Sportsmen's, Knickerbocker Club, New York Yacht, Meadow Brook, Racquet and Tennis, Riding, and Garden City Golf Clubs, also the Automobile Club of America.
Hollins' great-great-grandson, through his son Gerald Vanderbilt Hollins, is actor Justin Theroux.
Meadow Farm and East Islip.
After Hollins' bankruptcy, Meadow Farm, the country manor, was sold to Charles L. Lawrance along with bordering the Great South Bay and Champlin Creek. The family renovated one of the farmhouses on the northern portion of the approximately remaining to which they relocated. After the death of Mrs. H. B. Hollins, a month after her husband, her daughter Marion as the administrator of the estate sold most of the property not utilized by the family. 
Meadow Farm was demolished in 2002/03 as part of the Harbour View project. This project was completion of The Moorings, a wealthy gated community by the subdividing Meadow Farm's remaining into 11 lots. The purchaser of the parcel (now 150 Meadowfarm Road) containing Meadow Farm learned the cost of refurbishing the mansion would have well exceeded $1 million and opted to replace it with a newer estate. According to a "New York Times" article written in 1999, the new estate's owner planned to salvage marble fireplaces, panelling and other appurtenances from the mansion. 
Remnants of Hollins' Meadow Farm can still be found off of Dock Road, including the original gates now leading to a small community named after the family, Hollins Estates. The once private road leading to the manor house was named Hollins Lane. The Hollins' stable and clock tower remains as a residential house at 37 Blackmore Lane. A carriage house, located west of Meadowfarm Road and last used as a residence, was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for a subdivision. At 35 Blackmore Lane is what was believed to have been the estate manager's (Blackmore) house, which had been moved from another location nearby. 
At 42 Blackmore Lane is a structure on a parcel which also belonged to Hollins. It was the renovated farmhouse they relocated to after parting with Meadow Farm. Harvard Class books from the 1930s were found in the house in the 1980s - a member of the Hollins family was pictured in those books. 
A company, Yarmouth Estates of Bay Shore, New York, has purchased the house at 42 Blackmore and is requesting a subdivision. Harry Hollins Jr.'s estate house, designed by the architectural firm of Cross & Cross and built in 1907, remains at 18 Crick Holly Lane and Gerald Hollins' home remains at 180 Bayview Avenue. The carriage house for Gerard Hollins' house still stands at 158 Bayview Ave and is now used as a private residence. Gerald Hollins later built a home on White Oak Lane, which still stands and is now the visitor's center for the South Shore Nature Center. 
Another Hollins' house, that of Robert L. Hollins, stands on the border of Hecksher State Park. That house is believed to have been one of the earliest houses in the area, originally part of the Nichol farm. It is now owned by the East Islip School District and is used for special education services. 
A private road once ran across all of the Hollins holdings, crossing Bayview Ave and through the estate of HB Hollins Jr., where it continued into what is now Hecksher State Park. The outline of this road can be seen running through the woods on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land off White Oak Lane. As recently as the 1980s, one area resident was concerned as the road was still listed as a legal right-of-way in his property deed. 
The town has named several things in the family's honour. Most notable is Hollins Memorial Beach, which the family generously donated to the town.
Hollins, along with members of his family, are interred at the Episcopal Church Cemetery in Great River, NY.
Hollins Island.
Hollins purchased an island approximately three and a half miles south of Meadow Farm and about a mile north of mainland Fire Island in the Great South Bay. The family used the island primarily for hunting before his bankruptcy, and some speculate that they contemplated the erection of a grand estate on the bay. The island retains the name Hollins Island, however it is sometimes referenced as East Fire Island (not to be confused with East Island, an island succumbed to the sea off Hollins Island's northeast shore) or Middle Island.
The island was originally owned by William Nicoll who purchased the property on November 19, 1687 from Winnequaheagh Sachem of Connetquot. The purchase was confirmed on a patent by Governor Dongan on June 4, 1688. Harry B. Hollins purchased the island in 1906 from the estate of Sarah Nicoll and presented it to three of his sons, Messers. Gerald, John, and McKim Hollins. 
Legend tells that the island was a hideaway for pirates' gold, most notably Captain Kidd's buried treasure of the Spanish Main. Due to this legend, the island was also referred to as Money Island and was the site of many excavations by treasure seekers.

San Giovanni Lipioni

San Giovanni Lipioni is a small village and "comune" located at the southernmost tip of Province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy, on a hill overlooking the river Trigno valley.
History.
The first settlement in the village presumably dates back to the pre-Roman times, when the area was under the control of the Samnites population. As an evidence of this is a "III century B.C. bronze man's head" discovered in the village countryside in 1847 and currently stored at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.Starting from the 14th century, the village was under the influence of the Kingdom of Naples through the Aragon and the D'Avalos families, of Spanish origin, which held possessions in the nearby coastal town of Vasto. The name "Lipioni" is thought indeed to be derived from the Spanish "los peones" (unskilled labourers), referring to the predominant peasantry condition and sheep-rearing activity of the village's inhabitants. Subsequently, until 1861 the village was under control of the Caracciolo families, always within the Kingdom of Naples territory.
Among the most important families of the village is nowadays the Rossi family, lawyers and medical doctors, owners of an important and ancient historical house. The building is now the focus of a judicial process between the heirs of the family.
Economy.
The village essentially lives on agriculture like the neighbouring ones. The majority of the working population is employed in the sector, and production is geared towards local and family consumption. The main produces are wine and extravirgin olive oil (renowned outside the region for its quality), along with wheat, corn, cherries, apples, walnuts, almonds, artichokes, tomatoes, and peppers. 
People.
After the end of World War II, because of severe poverty and high unemployment, the village suffered a considerable emigration towards richer Northern Italy areas, especially in the town of Bologna, where a sizeable community live nowadays. A small number also migrated to Belgium, in the Charleroi area to work in the local coal mines, and France by subsequently settling there. From around 900 units in 1951, the population halved to 457 in 1982, and down to 371 in 1991, according to official ISTAT statistics. In 2001 the total population plummeted to 271 units and as of 2006, the stable residents are less than 250, of which those aged 65+ account for half of the total. 
Territory.
The village lies at an elevation of . The territory's highest peaks are Colle Vernone, overlooking the village, and the mountain Il Monte, , facing it. Oaks and beeches are the predominant trees, along with firs and pine trees. Olive trees are also quite widespread over the territory, followed by fig, apple and cherry trees. Bush vegetation includes several type of wild berries and yellow brooms blooming in mid-springtime. Fauna features increasing numbers of boars and foxes, owls, and a few EU-protected species of kites ("Milvus milvus" and "Milvus migrans") that nest in the woods of Il Monte and its vicinity.
The nearest villages are Torrebruna and Celenza sul Trigno at a distance of each. The river Trigno separating Abruzzo from Molise runs in the valley beneath the village for .
Traditions and specialties.
On Labour Day (May, 1st) a colourful pageant is held throughout the village's high streets to celebrate "lu Maje" (The May), a circle-shaped wooden cane decked with small bunches of wild pink underbrush violets and other spring flowers and carried at the forefront of the pageant, which kicks off at the main church soon after the late morning mass. The flowers are then gifted to all families of the village during the door-to-door parade. A marching band plays along while food-and-drinks stalls are set out on the streets. 
In early August, when the village comes alive with expatriates, night-time food feasts (called "sagre") are common. One of these is the "sagn' app'zat" (literally "sagnas cut into pieces"), which are freshly made, slightly thick pasta layers sliced into rough squares and eaten with a simple basil-and-tomato sauce, extra-virgin olive oil, and occasionally topped with lumps of ricotta cheese and/or bits of sliced spicy red chillies. 
On every second Saturday of October, the food feast of the "scurpelle"—simple salted sourdough batons, long, deep-fried in olive oil and eaten as such, accompanied by a glass of new red wine—is made to celebrate Santa Liberata.
Another worth-mentioning specialty, also common to most villages in southern area of Chieti's province, is the "ventricina", a usually round-shaped salami made of fresh pork finely chopped and mingled with bits of lard, ground dried red medium-spicy peppers, fennel seeds, and coarse salt, usually prepared during the colder winter days of January (after the first snow falls it is tradition to slaughter a pig), then hanged on the ceiling in a dry room and seasoned for usually 1+ months until ready to be sliced and served with freshly baked bread as an appetizer. At the same time, fresh pork sausages and pig liver sausages and several varieties of salami are prepared as well.
Trivia.
The origins of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Italian scorer Fabio Grosso can be traced to the village, where his father was born and raised. His surname, along with Rossi and Monaco, is indeed quite common amongst the inhabitants.

New Red Sandstone

The New Red Sandstone is a chiefly British geological term for the beds of red sandstone and associated rocks laid down throughout the Permian (280 million years ago) to the end of the Triassic (about 200 million years ago) that underlie the Jurassic Lias; the term distinguishes it from the Old Red Sandstone which is largely Devonian in age.
Its upper layers consist of mudstones, but most of the formation consists of reddish sandstones, interbedded with rare evaporite minerals such as halite and gypsum; these indicate deposition within a hot and arid palaeo-environment e.g. a desert or sabkha.
Central UK locations.
The New Red Sandstone covers much of central England, where it generally forms a low-lying plain except for the Mid Severn Sandstone Plateau. Thick layers (up to 1100 m thick) are present in the faulted Cheshire Basin which also extends beneath north Shropshire. There are numerous escarpments forming small prominent hills within this area. The sandstone also underlies parts of Lancashire and Cumbria, and east of the Pennines it extends through Nottinghamshire and central Yorkshire. Smaller outcrops occur in other parts of Britain such as the Red Cliffs of Dawlish and East Devon.
Lithology.
In terms of its lithology, the New Red Sandstone comprises true sandstones, mudrocks and evaporite strata. The sandstone units are monomineralic, consisting only of quartz grains (negligible amounts of other minerals may be present), and they are cemented together with the ferric iron oxide haematite (Fe2O3). The presence of this particular iron oxide is evidence for a terrestrial environment of deposition such as a desert, and gives the rocks the red colour which they are named after. The common effect of rusting produces exactly the same deposit, but as a result of a different process. The sandstone units generally lack fossils (as do most terrestrial rocks). The grains in the member have a high degree of sphericity, are very well sorted and typically have a small size range (0.5 mm to 2 mm).
The NRS is a texturally mature rock. Certain units of the New Red Sandstone (e.g. Helsby Sandstone Formation) feature commonly as building stone in the Cheshire area due to their abundance and mechanical strength.

Wildcat (Hersheypark)

Wildcat is a wooden roller coaster located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Midway America section of the park, just across from Wild Mouse. The ride was named after Wild Cat (Hersheypark), Hersheypark's first roller coaster, which operated from 1923 to 1945 (1923–1945). Wildcat was also the first coaster built by Great Coasters International, and initially ran with trains built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company until 2007 when they were replaced with GCI's Millennium Flyer trains.
Like many other GCI coasters, Wildcat contains a curved first drop to reduce chances of nausea. There is an on-ride camera located towards the end of the ride prior to the final brake run.
The ride was known for being extremely rough and painful while operating with the original trains. After the ride was retrofitted with Millennium Flyer trains, guests and enthusiasts alike noticed that the ride was less painful but retained its original roughness.
The Wildcat is located on a relatively large hill, causing it to appear much higher than it is in reality.
In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme (Hersheypark in the Dark), the Wildcat is dubbed the Scaredycat.

25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers

The 25th (Frontiersmen) Service Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) was a British Army unit that served during World War I. It was raised by the Legion of Frontiersmen.
The battalion served in the African Theatre of the war from 1915–1918, centered mostly in the area around Lake Tanganyika, British East African and German East African territory. The battalion was largely composed of older men who hailed from diverse backgrounds and varied occupations, some of whom were Boer War veterans. Amongst these occupations were English big-game hunters, a British millionaire, several American cowboys, a Scottish light-house keeper, a naturalist, a circus clown, an Arctic explorer, an opera singer, a famous photographer, and a lion tamer. There were also French Foreign Legionaries and Russians (reportedly prison escapees from Siberia).
The unit was formed on 12 February 1915 by Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Patrick Driscoll, who was, at that time, fifty-five years of age, well above that of an average soldier. Another noted serving officer (and eventually the Second in Command of the battalion) was Frederick Courteney Selous, a veteran of various small African wars and skirmishes, a famous big-game hunter and friend of Theodore Roosevelt. Selous had previously hunted with Roosevelt during his famed 1909 African safari. Selous is also known for having served as the inspiration for Sir H. Rider Haggard to create his fictional Allan Quartermain character, a 19th Century African explorer and hunter of big-game beasts. Captain Selous was later killed in action with the unit, shot through the mouth by a German sniper in January 1917. The unit gained the nickname "Old and the Bold", due to its members' ages, their veteran status, and reputation for endurance and daring against the enemy, Even though the majority of volunteers were young men. The battalion was disbanded on 19 June 1918.
The exploits of "The Old and the Bold" were later the loose basis of the "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" episode "The Phantom Train of Doom" (German East Africa, November 1916). Veteran "Raiders of the Lost Ark" actor Paul Freeman portrayed Selous as an adventurous, cunning, yet decisive commander.

Schiavi di Abruzzo

Schiavi di Abruzzo is a hill town in the Apennine Mountains,
in central part of the Italian Peninsula, in Italy.
It is in the Chieti province, in the southernmost portion of the Abruzzo region,
on border with the Molise region.
It is , from the Adriatic Sea,
and from Rome.
It is known for its beautiful panoramic views.
Given its proximity, it has not experienced modern development,
and thus it is a well preserved Medieval and Renaissance era town.
Geography.
The historical center of the town is situated at the highest point of a mountain peak, at , and there are population centers or administrative divisions in the valleys on three sides of the mountain. Three quarters of the population lives in these surrounding valleys.
Heavy snowfall can occur in winter months.
Language and dialect.
The town populated by Italians and the Italian language is spoken, which is part of the family of Italic languages.
Also prevalent is a historical Italian dialect known as Schiavese. For many centuries there have been different dialects even between towns in the same vicinity. With the advent of television, the dialects have become less prevalent.
Population.
The municipal boundaries cover . With a population in 2004 of 1,265, the density was 73 persons per square mile.
The population in 1861 was 3,657. As was the case of the rural areas of Southern Italy, the town experienced a mass immigration (Italian diaspora) to North and South America between 1861 and 1914. This immigration lead an abrupt decline of the agricultural economy.
Nonetheless the population peaked in 1961 at 4,526. Since then there has been a steady decline due to residents having sought employment in the Italian cities (mostly Rome), and also throughout Europe.
Religion.
The only church in the town is Roman Catholic, and it has been part of The Diocese of Trivento since about 300 AD. The church building occupies the highest point.
Prior to World War II there was a Waldensian Evangelical Church (AKA Waldensians, congregations originating in the 12th century and thus predating the Protestant Reformation). The Waldensian church building was vacant for many years and as of 2008 became the town library and archives under the auspices of the Archeoclub d'Italia.
History.
From about 600 BC to 290 BC. the region was known as Samnium, home to the Samnites, a group of Sabellic tribes.
The first written mention of the town dates back to Middle Ages, in the first half of the 11th century. Also, the name Schavis and Sclavi appeared in the Libro delle decime (tithe book) of 1309 and of 1328. It is commonly known that there was a colony of Slavs that became a fief of Roberto da Sclavo, from which the name of the town was probably derived.
Beginning in 1130 the town was part of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, which from 1282 to 1816 became known as the Kingdom of Naples. The throne in Naples later passed from the Angevins of France (1285), to the Crown of Aragon of Spain (1494), to the Bourbons of Spain (1714), to Napoleon (1806).
From 1626 until 1806 the town was also a fief of the Caracciolo di SantoBuono
a branch the Caracciolo clan of Naples, and administered from San Buono, a town away. During the early modern period it was common in southern Italy and throughout Europe for towns to be bought and sold, and often held for many generations by the aristocracy, thus obtaining power to tax and administer local justice, while remaining subject to the monarchy. Castiglione MM, a town adjacent to Schiavi was controlled by the same family.
From 1816–1861 it was part of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, then becoming part of the Kingdom of Italy
Templi Italici archaeological site.
In the valley below the town are the ruins of two temples dating from the period of Classical Antiquity, from about 3 BC, to the height of the Roman Empire. Known as the Templi Italici, referring to the Italic people who were Ancient peoples of Italy of whom the Samnites were a subgroup.
The Schiavi d’Abruzzo archaeological site is located in the Colle della Torre district, at 864 metres above sea level. It stands alongside the country road climbing from the bottom of the Trigno valley to the town. Its panoramic setting dominates the valley below and the Molise mountain chains home to Pietrabbondante. Two parallel temples, built one next to the other but at different times and using different construction techniques, are all that is visible today. They stand in a clearing terraced by a long wall of polygonal e ashlar masonry, comprising the western edge of the sanctuary. Recent exploration work has made it possible to increase our knowledge of the area, thanks to some important new finds: the monumental altar opposite the minor building, an extensive necropolis on the slope to the south-east of the temples, used from the 10th century B.C. to the height of Roman times, therefore partly contemporary with the nearby sanctuary, and another holy site a little further downhill, featuring a small two-room building abandoned shortly after the social war. The two-floor mediaeval tower is also visible today, built behind the polygonal masonry wall of the sanctuary. The area owes its name, Colle della Torre (Tower Hill), to this structure.
The archeological digs have been conducted by the Abruzzo Department of Archaeological Assets. See an overview of the site: Abruzzi Region cultural site (in Italian), and a scientific archaeological description: Beni Archeologici Abruzzo, (in Italian).
Parks.
Purgatorio Park provides a secluded and scenic walk among pine trees.
There is also a small park honoring Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina.
Attractions.
A replica of the Grotto of the Madonna of Lourdes is being constructed in the valley just below the town and the Italic Temples. In 1995, town resident Franco Cirulli's wife received a miraculous cure after a pilgrimage to Lourdes. With that Mr. Cirulli received a vision from the Madonna that the grotto of Lourdes be replicated in Schiavi di Abruzzo. An organization was formed to raise funds, and it is supported by the local bishop, and town officials. The effort also has a website, and has received news coverage by the religious press. As of August 2011 the project was about 60% complete.
Surnames.
As witnessed by the World War I and World War II memorial, CIRULLI and FALASCA are the most common last names. Other surnames recorded in the municipality are

Taranta Peligna is a "comune" and town in the Province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy. It is from Chieti, and it has a population of 521.
Located in the Aventino Valley, at the foot of the Maiella, in the past it was famous for its industry of woolen cloth called "taranta", a still thriving activity.
The territory, which covers , is in a predominantly upland area rich with caves, such as the cave of Bue, Asino, and Cavallone or Figlia di Iorio. The first historical mention goes back to the 15th century. In the 13th century the commune was fiefdom of Bernard from Acciano and of Henry from Portella, and later was a property of the Caldora and t Malvezzi, a noble family of Bologna. In the 17th century Taranta Pelign passed under the d’Aquino family that kept it until the end of the feudality. Taranta Peligna has several monuments, such as the façade of the St. Nicola church, the portal of the 16th century of St. Biagio church and the crucifix on wooden board by Antoniazzo from Romano in the Trinity church. Outside the built up area, on the way to Lettopalena, a small street to the right leads to the sources of running waters; they are spring pools coming out from the earth, creating a spectacular environment.

The World Jiu-Jitsu Championship (commonly known as Mundials) is the most prestigious Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) tournament in the world. They are hosted annually by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation. The first Mundial tournament to be held outside of Brazil was in 2007 at the California State University in Long Beach, California, USA. This trend continued with the 2008 "Mundials", once again in Long Beach, California. The first World Championship was held in 1996 at the Tijuca Tênis Clube gymnasium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and has since grown tremendously, with over 1650 competitors (including 250 foreign athletes) fighting before a crowd of over 12,000 in the 2005 championship.

Malcolm Ross (school teacher)

Malcolm Ross (born 1946) is a former schoolteacher from the Canadian city of Moncton, who became notable for his antisemitic writings, including Holocaust denial.
In 1991, a local Jewish parent, David Attis, filed a human rights complaint against Ross's employers, New Brunswick School District 15, on the grounds that Ross's continued employment created a poisoned environment for Jewish students (including Attis's daughter, who, although not a student at Magnetic Hill School where Ross taught, had been intimidated out of attending interscholastic activities at Magnetic Hill).
After a lengthy hearing, during which Ross was represented by Doug Christie, the human rights commission ordered the District to remove Ross from the classroom, and to terminate his employment unless Ross's school could find a non-teaching position for him (and in fact, he was made the school librarian). In addition, the District warned Ross that, if he continued to publish or distribute antisemitic literature, his non-teaching position would be terminated as well. Attis was not awarded any damages.
The New Brunswick Court of Appeal subsequently ruled that these decisions were in violation of Ross's rights to freedom of religion and freedom of expression, and overturned the District's orders.
However, in 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Ross's removal from the classroom was justifiable, on the grounds that, although it did constitute a violation of his freedoms, this was a reasonable limit, as schoolteachers must be held to a higher standard of behaviour. 
The Court further ruled that the District's "gag order" (that Ross be dismissed from his non-teaching position should he continue to publish and distribute antisemitic material) was invalid.
In 1998, Ross filed a defamation lawsuit against Josh Beutel, an editorial cartoonist for the Telegraph-Journal, who had compared Ross to Joseph Goebbels; the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick ruled that, as Nazism was an anti-religious philosophy, and Ross was profoundly religious, Ross's extreme degree of antisemitism could not fairly be labeled as Nazistic. Beutel was ordered to pay Ross $7500 in damages, however a 2000 appeal overturned this decision.
In 2000, Ross' appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee was rejected, stating that "the removal of the author from a teaching position can be considered a restriction necessary to protect the right and freedom of Jewish children to have a school system free from bias, prejudice and intolerance".

The K-Type is a family of automobile engines developed and produced by Renault since the mid-1990s. This is an internal combustion engine, four-stroke, with 4 cylinders in line bored directly into the iron block, water cooled, with tree (s) driven overhead camshafts (s) by a toothed timing belt, with an aluminum cylinder head and valve head. This engine is available in petrol and diesel versions, with 8 or 16 valves.
History.
The K-Type engine is an evolution of "Energy engine", it is intended to replace. The "Energy engine" was already an evolution of "Cléon-Fonte engine" in which a hemispherical head incorporating head camshaft driven by a toothed timing belt was fitted. The K-Type engine is the ultimate evolution of the "Cléon-Fonte engine". The main modification of the K-Type engine is operated at machining cylinder, since this engine has removable liners. The 8-valve cylinder versions species is taken from Energy engine. The first engine K appears on the Megane 1 with a capacity of 1598 cm3, with a yoke 8 valves, K7M.
Evolution.
Gasoline versions.
In 1998, the K7M engine is topped by a 16-valve cylinder head under the hood of the Laguna 1 Phase 2 - the K4M. This new engine replaces the 1.8 "F-Type engine" of Laguna 1 Phase 1.
Diesel versions.
The K9K engine - diesel version with 1461 cc - appeared on the Clio 2 Phase 2, to replace the 1.9 D ("F-Type engine" ). This engine is equipped with high-pressure direct injection common-rail.
KxJ petrol engine.
The KxJ displaces 1390 cc or 1.4 L. It is an evolution from Renault Energy ExJ.
Applications (K7J 8v).
Starting 2011 Dacia replaced the old KxJ with Euro 5 1.0 (16 valves), 1.2 (16 valves) and 1.6 liter engines.
KxM petrol engine.
The KxM engine has a displacement of 1,598 cc (or 1.6 L) featuring multi-point fuel injection and EGR emission control system fitted.
 
K7M engines tend to suffer quite badly from head gasket failure but are otherwise very tough and powerful engines. 8mm square key is required for the oil drain plug.
K9K dCi.
The K9K is a family of straight-4 turbocharged diesel engines co-developed by Nissan and Renault. The turbocharger is provided by Borg-Warner. It has a displacement of 1461 cc and is called 1.5 dCi (diesel Common-rail injection). Fuel injection systems were supplied by Delphi on the lower power level versions (up to 66 kW/90 hp) and by Continental (ex Siemens) on the higher power level versions (70 kW/95 hp and higher). Delphi systems were changed with Bosch ones in Euro 5 version.
There are three versions of this engine: a low power version, a high power version and a high power version with variable geometry turbocharger. Their maximum power output varies depending on the emission standards they meet. In Euro 3 standards, their power levels are , and . In Euro 4 standards, their power levels are , and . In Euro 5 standards, their power levels are , and .

Im Juli

Im Juli. () is a 2000 German-Turkish road movie.
Plot.
At the beginning of his summer holiday, a somewhat naive trainee teacher Daniel (Moritz Bleibtreu) buys a ring from a stall run by a neighbor, the aspiring artist and street vendor Juli (in German, "Juli" would be not only the month July but also a common nickname for someone named "Julia"; Christiane Paul). The ring bears a Mayan sun symbol, which, according to Juli, has the power to lead him to the woman of his dreams, whom he will recognise by a similar sun symbol. As Juli has the ring's counterpart, and as she is in love with him, she invites Daniel to a party that evening, hoping that they will meet.
Curious, Daniel goes to the party and meets Melek (İdil Üner), a young Turkish woman who is wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a sun symbol. Convinced that she is the woman of his dreams, Daniel talks to her. Melek is only passing through and looking for a place to spend the night. After spending the evening together seeing the sights of Hamburg, Daniel invites her to spend the night in his apartment.
Daniel and Melek leave the party just as Juli arrives. She sees them leave together. In her disappointment, she decides to leave town. Next day she goes to the Autobahn to hitch a ride, with no predetermined destination.
As fate would have it, Daniel is the first car to stop, on his way back from the airport, where he has just dropped Melek off. He has decided to drive to Istanbul in search of Melek, who, as she told him, will be under the bridge over the Bosporus at a certain time a few days later, although he does not know why. Daniel takes Juli with him in his stoner roommate's rusty old car. And this is the beginning a long and exciting trip across a scorching hot Southeastern Europe.
Symbolism.
The film opens with an eclipse, an event in which the sun and the moon cross paths. Daniel crosses paths with Luna, whose name means "moon," and suffers the consequences. July is a sunny month.

The Renault R-Type is an straight-4 diesel engine produced from 2011. It replaces the 1.9 dCi engine in Renault's range and replaces the 2.0 dCi in the Nissan Qashqai. When launched, the engine produced however a higher-powered twin-turbocharged variant producing will be introduced later.
R9M 130PS.
R9M 130PS was introduced in 2011.
Developed within the framework of the Alliance, the newcomer's performance credentials are similar to those of its predecessor, the 1.9 dCi 130 engine. This 1.6-litre powerplant delivers peak power of 96kW (130hp) and generous torque of 320Nm available across a broad rev-band. . 
This new block marks the beginning of a new phase in Renault's engine downsizing policy. The downsizing was obtained thanks to the shortening of the stroke of the pistons and a redesign of the reciprocating parts. The cylinder's swept volume is reduced and thereby diminishes the amount of fuel being burned during each cycle. Performance levels have been maintained, however, by improving turbocharging efficiency.
Applications:
R9M 160PS.
R9M 160PS was launched in Feb.2011 It is twin-turbocharged developed from the new Energy dCi 130.
It produces 118kW (160hp) from a capacity of 1.6 litres – that’s a specific power output of 100hp per litre. Peak torque (380Nm) is available from as low as 1,750rpm, giving powerful acceleration from low revs, as well as refined performance under all driving conditions.

Acciano

Acciano is a "comune" in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy. The small, medieval village is in the Subequana valley and is a part of the Sirentina Mountain Community.
This village is well known in Italy for its quality productions of Montepulciano red wines.
History.
Many monuments of great artistic significance are situated in the area including a recent discovery which found a square structure of an ancient Italic-Roman temple as well as numerous pottery fragments scattered around it. The structure is located between the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie and the cemetery in the S. Lorenzo. The test, run by the Archaeological Superintendence of Chieti, dated the relics to between the Republican and the first imperial age of the Roman Empire. Renowned Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli discovered old burial tombs and fragments of bucchero vases around the Church of San Lorenzo. The discovery by Antonio De Nino in contrada Vicenna of shrouds and an elaborate system of underground tunnels with evident traces of a mosaic floor near the ancient cemetery is enough evidence to testify that there was an ancient town located at Acciano(for lack of funds now, these excavations have been covered by soil until they can be best appreciated).
Various aristocratic families in Italy and Spain, such as the feuding Piccolomini and Scialenghi Strozzi families, rotated possession of the village. The presence of walls, towers (now destroyed) and doors bear witness to Acciano's strategic importance as the connection between the Adriatic and Rome, an importance it would bear for centuries.
Etymology.
The name Acciano (Hacciànë) was stabilized in 1028 as Accio. The name comes from the Roman noble, Accius, meaning "family farm Acció". Today the town of Acciano is made up of capital and the fractions of Beffi, Succiano, Roccapreturo and San Lorenzo. Onciari in land and fires counts made between the 15th-16th centuries were called respectively: Castrum Acciani, Villa Socciani, Castrum Beffi, Rocca Preturo and Villa de Sancti Laurentii. Knowing what the study of place names, the historical reconstruction aid, we will give briefly the meaning and origin of the names of local villages and town. Castrum Castrum Beffa Acciani and the first part of the name refers to the Roman castrum, castellum then, and even fortified citadel, bastion. Villa and Villa Sancti Socciani Laurentii: the first part of the name derives from the Latin villa, originally a country house, farm to farm and small settlement, then almost synonymous with country. Rocca de Preturo: Rocca - rock - and later the fortress on top of a mountain, town, born in the Abruzzo region voice from the 12th century.
Geography.
Surrounded by green woods of oak, Acciano is perched on a spur of rock between the mountains and stones Bufame Fitte which offers a beautiful view of the rocky ridges of Sirente. 
The steep slopes that surround the village frame the valley in which flows the river Aterno. 
The territory of the municipality varies in elevation from above sea level, a range of . 
The distance from the capital, L'Aquila, is about along the road "Valley Subequana". Sulmona is about away.
Fortified town of Acciano.
The small country of some Longobard still fortified houses of medieval origin. The historic center of Acciano, enclosed within the walls still exist, denotes the condition of a fortified village where access was gained through three doors: Porta Torrone, Porta Martino, and Porta of Aia. The topography of the land affected in its pre-eminent urban typology which lies on steep slopes to the left of the river Aterno. The history of the village is from the 14th century, when the arrangement of the walls, to the 16th century, given the reconstruction or rehabilitation of several buildings.

Iban Zubiaurre

Iban Zubiaurre Urrutia (born 22 January 1983 in Mendaro, Gipuzkoa) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right defender.
Football career.
After making his Real Sociedad first-team debuts during the 2004–05 season, Zubiaurre achieved notoriety as a result of a lawsuit in which his first club prevented him from playing for Athletic de Bilbao for 14 months, due to an alleged illegality in his transference between the two Basque clubs.
Zubiaurre, who represented Real Sociedad at youth level, was 'presented' as new Athletic Bilbao player in 2005 by club president Fernando Lamikiz, despite still being under contract. He had no permission to rescind his contract, which had a year left to run and a buy-out clause of €33 million, and Real insisted that Athletic pay the entire amount, with the player not being allowed to play professional football during the subsequent legal battle; SCD Durango, a regional club, asked permission to field him, but were denied.
15 months after the lawsuit began, a judge ruled that Athletic had to pay Real Sociedad €5 million, and were granted permission to field Zubiaurre for the 2006–07 campaign. He was presented for a second time at San Mamés Stadium on 16 November 2006, and was given the number 12 shirt.
On 11 February 2007 Zubiaurre played his first La Liga match for Athletic, appearing against Atlético Madrid as a substitute in a 0–1 away defeat. That was to be his only game of the season, in which his team avoided relegation on the very last matchday.
In 2007–08 Zubiaurre also only featured once, in a 0–2 loss at Getafe CF on 31 October 2007. After almost two years in the sidelines, he left the side to gain more playing time, joining second division outfit Elche CF on a season-long loan.
Returned to Athletic for the 2009–10 season, Zubiaurre's season input consisted of 15 minutes against FK Austria Wien (3–0 win at home), for the UEFA Europa League group stage. In July 2010 another loan ensued, also in the second level, as he joined Albacete Balompié.
Zubiaurre was deemed surplus to requirements at Athletic in 2011–12 after the appointment of manager Marcelo Bielsa, alongside teammates Koikili and Aitor Ocio. He remained with the team however.
Zubiaurre was loaned to UD Salamanca in the third level for the 2012–13 season. He moved to Racing de Santander in August 2013, being waived after only one month and no matches played.

Alfedena

Alfedena is a "comune" in the province of L'Aquila of the Abruzzo region of central Italy. It is located in the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park in the upper Sangro valley, near the Monti della Meta mountain chain.
Alfedena, as we know it today, was founded by the "Samnites", who called it "Aufidena", because of its excellent strategic view over the high Sangro valley. Alfedena was the setting of several conflicts through its history because of this location. Alfedena was a district of the superior Samnites before it was the capital town of the Carecini tribe during their first settlement near the high Saro, the ancient name of today’s Sangro river. Alfedena was then conquered by the Romans in 298 b.c., and by the Longobards during the 11th century.
Many valuable works of art, such as the Ponte Achille (Achille’s bridge), dating back to the Roman age, were destroyed by German mines during the defens of the Gustav line. The Germans took away, as spoils, many ruins of the Italic necropolis of Campo Consolino located next to the village, which counted 1400 tombs on a total amount of 12.000 tombs. Part of the stolen archeological finds were returned after an accurate restoration at the Tübingen University. The archaeological excavations bear witness to the ancient presence in the area and to its historically autonomous civilization.
Some ruins of Cyclopian masonry can also be seen in the districts of Civitalta, Curino, and S. Nicola, with some columns and ruins of a temple brought to life by excavations. The village boasts an ancient tradition in the crafts of stone carving. The last craftsmen made the artistic paving of the town unique to its genre. In the historical center, people can admire the octagonal castle of the Simone’s feud, Count of Sangro.

Vanderbilt University Divinity School

The Vanderbilt Divinity School and Graduate Department of Religion (usually Vanderbilt Divinity School) is an interdenominational divinity school at Vanderbilt University, a major research university located in Nashville, Tennessee. It is one of only six university-based schools of religion in the United States without a denominational affiliation that service primarily mainline Protestantism (University of Chicago Divinity School, Harvard Divinity School, Wake Forest University School of Divinity, Yale Divinity School, and Howard University School of Divinity are the others).
Early history.
Vanderbilt Divinity School was founded in 1875 as the Biblical Department and was under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, one predecessor of the present-day United Methodist Church. In 1914, in concert with the University's severance of its ties with the MECS, the school became interdenominational and ecumenical, and in 1915, the school's name was changed from the Biblical Department of Vanderbilt University to the Vanderbilt School of Religion; it adopted its present name in 1956. The present physical plant of the school, known colloquially as the "quadrangle" or "quad," was completed in 1960; the Benton Chapel that abuts the quad is named for a mid-20th-century dean, John Keith Benton. In 1966 the Graduate School of Theology of Oberlin College in Ohio merged with that of Vanderbilt, increasing the faculty resources of both the Divinity School and the Graduate Department of Religion, as well as the holdings of the school's portion of the University Library.
Civil Rights era.
A notable period in the history of Vanderbilt Divinity School was the American Civil Rights era. In 1960, African-American Divinity student James Lawson was expelled from the university for his role in nonviolent protests in the Nashville area. This expulsion, in turn, sparked great protest from many members of the Vanderbilt community, including most of the faculty of the Divinity School, who resigned "en masse". The so-called "Lawson Affair" was eventually resolved with Lawson's nominal reinstatement, and the resigned faculty resumed their posts, with the exception of the Dean of the Divinity School
Denominations served.
Despite having ended formal association with Methodism nearly a century ago, the United Methodist Church is the largest beneficiary of graduates from the Divinity School, with sizable numbers ordained in denominations such as the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) (which operates a seminarian apartment nearby the campus), the Presbyterian Church (USA), and African-American Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal groups. VDS, through the merger with Oberlin and an earlier absorption of a Congregationalist seminary in Atlanta in 1929, maintains a historical relationship (although no legal ties) with the United Church of Christ as well.
Students come from throughout the United States, representing numerous denominations and traditions.
Degrees conferred.
The Divinity School awards the following degrees:
Leadership.
The dean of the Vanderbilt Divinity School is Emilie M. Townes, formerly on the faculty of Yale Divinity School in Connecticut. Notable recent deans of the Divinity School include Joseph C. Hough, Jr., Sallie McFague, Walter Harrelson, and H. Jackson Forstman.
Vanderbilt Divinity School is a member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

Barrea

Barrea is a "comune" in the province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy.
It is located on the shore of the Lake of Barrea, a lake created after World War II due to the building of a dam on the river Sangro.
History.
The village of Barrea descends from the pre-Roman population of the Samnites, who linked their destinies to the village. Currently, along the shores of the lake or in the nearby archaeological site of Alfedena, traces abound from this period. There is a document from the year 996 in which the ancient name of Barrea, "Vallis Regia", first appears. This document also mentions that Barrea was given to the Duke of Spoleto during the dark feudal times in Italy, a period noted for its anarchic regimes and barbaric raids.
Perhaps mainly to protect themselves from the fierce raid of the Huns, the inhabitants of the valley floor sheltered near a Benedictine monastery in a strategic position on the precipice of the river Sangro. Even today the monastery still exists and has withstood the ravages of man and the assault of time and the elements. In the following centuries, the inhabitants of Barrea built a tangle of practically impregnable houses along the southwestern side of the valley. Everything is protected by nature on one side and by observation towers, one round and one square, and defensive walls on the other. Historic records of this town mirror other examples found in Italy: bloody wars, rivalries and even devastating earthquakes. 
One side of the original, central castle was protected from invaders by natural means, utilizing the impassably steep slope of the mountain; two stone castle gates afforded other protection to the castle and the homes that were built within its walls, dug into the slides of the mountain and giving out through front entrances facing on narrow, twisting, steep stone alleys. 
Its location surrounded by the Apennines would have prevented Barrea's development into an industrial area had not other economic obstacles also existed; historically, residents existed by tending small farms in plots on the mountainside. A major emigration took place after the earthquake of 1984, when many residents declined to return to the homes that were ruined in the tremor. Many of the homes have been bought by tourists, who enjoy Barrea's location on the brow of a mountainside, giving out over the Sangro valley, but there are fewer than 1,000 permanent inhabitants. 
Today, Barrea is at the center of the National Park of Abruzzo, a natural area rich in wildlife and recreation and lacking any aspect of urban commercialization. The village contains many monuments to its sufferings in World War II, when it was subjected to Allied bombings.

Chuck McCann

Chuck McCann (born September 2, 1934) is an American film actor, television actor, stage actor, and a voice actor.
Career.
Early work.
McCann was a comedy giant to a generation of children who grew up watching his children's shows in the New York metropolitan area during the 1960s, having worked his way up to regional star status by apprenticing on a number of other children's shows like "Captain Kangaroo" and "Rootie Kazootie" (the show on which he met his one-time puppeteer and sidekick, Paul Ashley). The best-selling "The First Family", an early '60s LP record album which lampooned the newly elected President John F. Kennedy and his family, included McCann among its voices.
Until late 1967, the tall, portly, moon-faced McCann hosted comedy/variety TV puppet shows in the New York area. McCann (with Ashley) did "The Puppet Hotel" for WNTA-TV, Channel 13; then "Laurel & Hardy & Chuck", "Let's Have Fun" and "The Chuck McCann Show" for WPIX, Channel 11; and finally, "The Chuck McCann Show", "The Great Bombo's Magic Cartoon Circus Lunchtime Show" and "Chuck McCann's Laurel and Hardy Show" for WNEW-TV, Channel 5. In addition, Chuck was the comedy sidekick on the WPIX long-running Clay Cole Show.
McCann's career was burgeoning by the time he left Channel 5, a victim of changing TV trends. By the end of the 1960s, he had appeared to critical acclaim in the 1968 film "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" and performed regularly on CBS's "The Garry Moore Show" and "Happy Days" (not the later sitcom). He also began a successful cartoon voice career, doing everything from Bob Kane's "Cool McCool" to Sonny the Cuckoo Bird ("I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!") in commercials for General Mills. He had even been one of the stars of producer George Schlatter's ill-fated offshoot of "Laugh-In", the one-episode "Turn-On".
In the 1970s, McCann's life and career shifted west, and he relocated to Los Angeles. He made frequent appearances on network television in everything from "Bonanza" to "Columbo" to "The Bob Newhart Show". He appeared in the 1973 made for TV movie The Girl Most Likely to... He had a steadier job as a regular on Norman Lear's "All That Glitters". In addition, he co-starred with Bob Denver in CBS's Saturday-morning sitcom "Far Out Space Nuts", which he co-created. The 1970s also brought him fame in a long-running series of commercials for Right Guard anti-perspirant: he was the enthusiastic neighbor with the catch phrase "Hi guy!" who appeared on the other side of a shared medicine cabinet, opposite actor Bill Fiore. McCann also impersonated Oliver Hardy in commercials for various products (teaming with Jim MacGeorge as Stan Laurel), and for a few years he played the holiday-season recurring role of Kris Kringle on the NBC soap opera "Santa Barbara".
McCann continued voice work for cartoons, playing Jollo, Bookworm, Bump-On-A-Log, and Woof in 1992's ' and speaking as The Thing on the "The Fantastic Four" and "Hulk" animated cartoon series. He was also the voice of Leatherneck in the 2nd season of '. Throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium, he has been in commercials—at Christmas he has played Santa Claus for one product or another—and TV/movie gigs ("Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"). He also voices Navarro and Buck in "Random! Cartoons", and Dumptruck, Gibber, and Sadie in Disney's "TaleSpin".
Film.
After "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter", McCann's motion picture career took a turn back into comedy with many supporting roles and a co-starring turn (with Tim Conway) in "They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way". His most notable post-"Hunter" films were "The Projectionist", "The Comeback Trail", and "Herbie Rides Again", where he played Loostgarten, president of Loostgarten Wrecking Company. He had a supporting role in the 1988 horror film "Cameron's Closet".
He also had a brief appearance in Mel Brooks' 1993 comedy film "" as a villager. He also appeared in Mel Brooks " Dracula Dead and Loving It".
Return to roots.
In 1980, McCann and Paul Ashley were to reunite for a pair of TV show pilots:
"Tiny TV" never reached fruition but "LBS Children's Theater" was picked up for national syndication in 1983. McCann emceed the series alone because Ashley never lived long enough to see the show, having died on September 3, 1984.
McCann voiced "Dreamfinder" in Disney's attraction "Journey Into Imagination".
Also during the 1980s, McCann reprised a number of his best sketches from his New York television days as interstitial material for a two-hour presentation of cartoons on KCOP-TV, Channel 13 in Los Angeles. (He was assisted by Bob Ridgely.)
And in 1989, McCann returned to daily children's television one more time with "Chuck McCann's Funstuff" (produced by fellow New York kid show legend Sonny Fox). "Chuck McCann's Funstuff" was seen weekday mornings on KHJ (KCAL) from Monday, September 18, 1989 until Friday, October 13, 1989.
1990s.
In the 1990s, McCann co-founded and participated in Yarmy's Army, a group of comedians and character actors of his generation who gathered regularly to cheer up Don Adams' brother Dick Yarmy, who was dying of cancer. A group with a massive array of comic talent, its members included Harvey Korman, Shelley Berman, Tim Conway, and many others.
After Yarmy's death, the group stayed together to cheer themselves up since increasing age and health problems made it increasingly more difficult for them to get steady work. In addition to having monthly dinners, they performed in various group-directed shows in select venues around the country.
2000s.
In the 2000s McCann appeared in "They Call Him Sasquatch" (2003) and "Dorf da Bingo King" (with his old pal, Tim Conway). He's supplied voices for "The Powerpuff Girls" and "Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas". And he's moved into the field of video games, supplying his talents to "".
McCann makes an appearance in "The Aristocrats" (2005), with an animated rendition of a "clean" version of the "dirty" joke that serves as the movie's subject
In 2006 and 2007 McCann made appearances on The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd as Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Floyd's father. He has also made multiple appearances as a judge on "Boston Legal", including the two-hour series finale in December 2008.
In 2007, McCann voiced villain Dalton Kern on the radio drama "Adventures in Odyssey".
In 2013, McCann voiced a character called Moseph "Moe" Mastro Giovanni on an episode of Adventure Time.
In 2013, he returned to voice the character of Duckworth in the Ducktales: Remastered video game.
Personal life.

Bugnara

Bugnara is a "comune" and village of 1,193 people in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy. It is one of the most beautiful villages in Italy (i borghi piu' belli d'Italia), an association that notes small Italian towns of strong artistic and historical interest.
Geography.
Coming from the direction of the beautiful gorge of the Sagittario river, Bugnara is the first village in the conch-shaped Peligna valley. It is on the ancient Samnite road which leads to Scanno and Villetta Barrea.
The village is between local hub Sulmona and the tourist destination of Scanno. Buses run from Scanno, past Bugnara, and on to Sulmona and Rome. 
Bugnara is at the foot of Colle Rotondo, elevation above sea level and Monte Genzana at more than , a ridge which runs from Scanno to Introdacqua. Trails lead up the mountain from Bugnara. Its territory goes up to the Sagittario river to the north. It overlooks the whole Peligna valley, with its buildings clustered around the Ducal Castle, known as the Castello Ducale or the Rocca dello Scorpione.
Bugnara is near the Gran Sasso d'Italia, which is the largest Italian mountain south of the Alps. Bugnara is also near Roccaraso, a popular ski resort. The most notable hamlet belonging to Bugnara is Torre dei Nolfi.
Name origins.
Although no one knows for certain the origins of the name Bugnara, there are various hypotheses which derive the term from "Bonae Ara", indicating an altar dedicated to the good mother goddess Bona or Ceres. This is supported by the fact that a pagan temple once stood where the Madonna della Neve church now stands. Of the temple we can still see today Roman flooring in a herringbone pattern or Opus spicatum. A carving found at the site has decorations showing priestesses undertaking a rite. 
Another hypothesis is that Bugnara comes from "Vignae Ara" thanks to the cultivation of vines around the village.
History.
The earliest documented evidence of Bugnara dates to the 6th century, although archaeological finds show that the settlement was inhabited much earlier. In the year 1000AD the Madonna della Neve church was built. In 1079 the borgo (fortified settlement) became the fiefdom of Simone di Sangro. It remained with the Sangro family until the extinction of their line in 1759 with Vittoria Mariconda di Sangro. In the 11th century the ducal palace or Palazzo Ducale was built by the Sangro family. They also rebuilt the Madonna della Neve church in 1361. The Sangros' power spread into the neighbouring settlements of Anversa degli Abruzzi, Frattura, Chiarana, but they didn't succeed in holding these territories.
In 1442, a feudal tribute called the Regia Dogana della Mena delle Pecore di Foggia was imposed. This had a major impact on Bugnara, given that it was dependent on agriculture.
In 1706, 1933 and 1984, Bugnara was hit by major earthquakes. In particular, the 1984 earthquake affected the village, and the historic churches of Bugnara were in accessible for a long time afterwards.
In 1891, a train line and station were built by Bugnara. The tall rail bridge over the Sagittario was blown up during World War II as it was seen as a link to Rome. The bridge was later reconstructed.
In 1974, an important historic and artistic artefact was rediscovered: the 13th century sculpture of the Virgin and Child called the Madonna delle Concanelle from the Madonna della Neve church. It is now conserved in the National Museum of Abruzzo which is housed in the Forte Spagnolo in L'Aquila.
Urban layout.
The village takes the triangular format typical of the Mediaeval period. The houses, built entirely in stone, were constructed one against the other. Narrow streets climb toward the top of the village, where the castle sits. Around the village are tratturi - pastoral routes for the migration of sheep between summer and winter pastures. These would have been heavily used in times gone by.
Buildings of artistic and historic importance.
Civic and fortified buildings.
Palaces:
Notable residents.
Annibale de Gasparis (Bugnara, 1819 – Napoli, 1892), astronomer
Village events.
Called "Hearts under the stars," Romantica is an all-night celebration with various specialist drink and food stalls, dancing, live music, a catwalk show, floral displays, theatrical events and photo exhibitions. The best florists in the world compete to decorate the historic town centre of Bugnara setting the scene for a unique event.
A 'sagra' is a celebration of a special local product. They are common in the summer in Abruzzo. This event is dedicated to Bugnara's most archetypal product: Pecorino cheese - a hard, full-flavoured, sheep's milk cheese. Bugnara Pecorino is particularly special because it has its origins in rich mountain pastures where only certain herbs grow, giving it its flavour.
This event in the hamlet of Torre dei Nolfi (part of the territory of Bugnara) celebrates the shared customs of an agricultural community, re-enacting the ancient tradition of "trebbiatura" or threshing of the grain using antique tools of the pre-industrial era. There are food stalls with local specialities.
The aim of this pre-Christmas event is to collect money for a charity which is chosen each year. Every organisation, school and other body of Bugnara arranges a market stall with artigianal products or foods.
Demographic change.
Bugnara's population (as collected in the census and reported by Istat) reached a peak of just over 3,000 between 1900 and 1930. However, the difficulty of life in the post-war era led to dramatic emigration in the 1950s and 1960s. Bugnara had reached its current population of just over 1,000 by the 1971 census.

Jackson Randy Rhoads

The Jackson Randy Rhoads is a model of electric guitar, originally commissioned by guitarist Randy Rhoads and produced by Jackson Guitars. Rhoads' first Jackson prototype was the white, pinstriped, asymmetrical Flying V built by Grover Jackson, Tim Wilson, and Mike Shannon of Charvel Guitars. The guitar featured a maple neck and body (neck through body), ebony fretboard, medium frets, Stratocaster style tremolo, and Seymour Duncan pickups. The prototype was the first from the Charvel works to be labeled with Jackson's name.
The guitar was originally slated to be called "The Original SIN", but Randy nicknamed it "Concorde". after the sleek, white supersonic aircraft Randy re-designed the next prototype because he felt the shape of the 'Concorde' was not distinctive enough from the traditional Flying V. His solution was to elongate the top 'horn' of the instrument such that the body bore more resemblance to a shark's fin. The second prototype featured the revised body shape, was black with a gold pickguard, and fixed tailpiece with strings anchored in the body.
The guitar featured Grover locking tuners and Seymour Duncan humbucking pickups (TB-4 bridge and a SH-2 neck). Two more prototypes were commissioned (four in total), another string through body example (later accidentally sold at NAMM) and another black and brass tremolo model with reversed shark fin inlays. Rhoads was killed in a plane crash before the second two guitars were completed, and before he could give Grover any feedback. These revised prototypes would become the first guitars sold to the public under the Jackson Guitars brand name. The ensuing popularity of the Randy Rhoads model put Jackson's name on the map.
Notable users.
Vinnie Vincent, formerly of Kiss, was the first professional guitarist to be offered an early Rhoads guitar by Jackson after Rhoads' death, which Vincent used on the Kiss Creatures of the Night and Lick It Up tours from 1982 until 1984. Following Vincent's departure from Kiss, he modified the Rhoads V design by adding a second V at a slight rotation to the first such that it mimics a shadow. Jackson made at least 3 of these Vincent modified Rhoads Vs from 1985 to 1988 for Vincent, and about 25 others were custom ordered and sold. The design would later be copied by Carvin, Ibanez and Washburn Guitars, all for Vinnie Vincent.
In 2001, guitarists Alexi Laiho and Roope Latvala (of Children of Bodom and Sinergy) had their own custom Randy Rhoads, which featured alder bodies, neck-thru construction, 24 frets, ebony fretboard, white binding, and gold hardware including an original Floyd Rose tremolo bridge. The electronics were the Jackson J-50BC pickup with JE-1000 preamp. The model was called the Jackson Randy Rhoads L/L (L/L for Latvala/Laiho). There were several different finishes, notably Laiho's which was black w/yellow bevels and gold hardware, and Latvala's main Rhoads was black with inverted cross inlays. You can see them playing these guitars in some of their earlier videos during their stint with Sinergy (Alexi & Roope), Stone (Roope), and in the Children of Bodom video(s): Everytime I Die, Deadnight Warrior and in Laiho's old Young Guitar videos during the Follow the Reaper and Hate Crew Death Roll era(s). Jackson released a limited amount of Jackson rr24 in the popular black with yellow bevels finish, but, was discontinued after a short time.
Other noted users include:

Pro Series.
The Pro series is the mid-market Randy Rhoads series. RR3, RR5, RR5FR, RR24, and RR24M were made in Japan. Newer models are made in Indonesia. 
X Series.

KDRY

KDRY (1100 AM) is an Alamo Heights/San Antonio, Texas, family-owned Christian radio station. 
KDRY was granted a license by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast from the city of Alamo Heights, near the downtown area of San Antonio, Texas. In 1963, the license was for 1,000 watts, daytime signal only, on frequency AM 1110. Samuel Nathaniel Morris was the driving force to build a radio station that would have a Christian preaching and teaching format.
In 1982, KDRY was granted a license by the FCC to expand its signal strength to 11,000 watts of power and move to 1100 on the AM frequency. The effect of this was a 75 mile signal strength during the day and 1000 watts covering primarily San Antonio during night time hours.
KDRY Radio, AM 1100 has been family owned and operated since 1963, and is currently on its third generation of ownership. 
KDRY airs national and local Christian radio programs. You can find the schedule at KDRY.com. [http://www.kdry.com].

Prince Arisugawa Takehito

Early life.
Prince Takehito was born in Kyoto as a scion of the house, one of the "shinnōke" branches of the Imperial Family of Japan, which were eligible to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in the event that the main line should die out. As he was born when the country was still under rule by the Tokugawa Bakufu, he was sent as a youth into the Buddhist priesthood, and assigned to serve at the "monzeki" temple of Myōhō-in in Kyoto. After the Meiji Restoration, he was recalled to secular life, and relocated to Tokyo in 1871.
Naval and diplomatic career.
In 1874, on orders from Emperor Meiji, Prince Arisugawa enrolled in the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. In 1877, despite his youth, he was sent as an observer to the Satsuma Rebellion, to observe the devastation first hand, and landed in Kagoshima shortly after it was secured by Imperial forces. 
In 1879, Prince Arisugawa was sent as a military attaché to Great Britain and embarked upon the , the flagship of Britain's Royal Navy, for further training. He served in the Channel Squadron for a year before returning to Japan as an ensign. 
In 1880, shortly after his wedding, Prince Arisugawa was again sent to England, this time as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He returned to Japan in June 1883. Prince and Princess Arisugawa made an extensive tour of Europe and America in 1889.
Prince Arisugawa’s first naval command was that of the corvette in early 1890, and his next was the cruiser later that year. 
In 1891 Arisugawa was assigned to the escort of Russian Crown Prince Nikolai (later Tsar Nicholas II) during his tour of Japan. However, while he was in the Prince's charge Nikolai was wounded in an assassination attempt, called the Otsu Scandal, which led to a considerable worsening of diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia.
In 1892, Arisugawa was posted as captain of the cruiser . He succeeded to the Arisugawa-no-miya title upon the death of his half-brother, Prince Arisugawa Taruhito, on January 15, 1895. 
During the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), Arisugawa commanded the cruiser and subsequently the cruiser in combat. He attained the rank of rear admiral on November 11, 1896. In 1896, he travelled to England again to represent the Emperor Meiji at the Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria.
Prince Arisugawa advanced to the rank of vice admiral on September 26, 1899. 
Promoted to full admiral on June 28, 1905, the Emperor Meiji appointed the prince a member of the Order of the Golden Kite (3rd Class) for his service during the Russo-Japanese War. He visited Europe again in 1905, when he and his wife represented the Emperor Meiji at the wedding of the German Crown Prince Wilhelm (1882–1951) to Duchess Cecile of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. They visited Great Britain again on their way back to Japan. During that visit, King Edward VII appointed Prince Arisugawa a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath.
Final years.
Of weak constitution since childhood, Prince Arisugawa took frequent medical leaves during his naval career. He built a summer home in Kobe and went into semi-retirement in 1909. Prince Arisugawa died on July 3, 1913 at his Kobe residence. However, news of his death was not made immediately public, and his body was rushed back to his palace in Kōjimachi, Tokyo by a specially chartered train, and his death formally announced on July 10, 1913.
He advanced to the honorary rank of marshal admiral on July 7, 1913, which was after his actual death, but before his "official death date", so the award was not considered posthumous. However, he was also awarded the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum posthumously.
Marriage & family.
On December 11, 1880, Prince Arisugawa married Maeda Yasuko (March 15, 1864–June 30, 1923), the fourth daughter of Maeda Yoshiyasu, the last "daimyō" of Kaga Domain (modern Ishikawa prefecture), by whom he had three children.
Since the prince died without a male heir (his son Prince Tanehito having died of appendicitis in 1908 while attending the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, Hiroshima), the direct line of descent of the house of Arisugawa-no-miya became extinct. 
However, his boyhood friend Prince Yoshihito, Emperor Taishō, revived the house (which reverted to its original name of Takamatsu-no-miya) in favor of his third son, Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito. Prince Nobuhito subsequently married Kikuko Tokugawa, a granddaughter of Prince Arisugawa Takehito.

<doc id="5948980" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948980" title="Castel del Monte, Abruzzo">
Castel del Monte, Abruzzo

Castel del Monte is a medieval and Renaissance hill town and "comune" in the province of L'Aquila in northern Abruzzo, Italy. Located in the heart of Gran Sasso mountain range, the town is set into a steep hillside nestled beneath mountain peaks near the high plain of Campo Imperatore. Castel del Monte sits opposite the ancient mountaintop fortress of Rocca Calascio and faces Monte Sirente in the distance. It is located in the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. 
History.
The name "Castel del Monte" is from the Latin "Castellum Montis", meaning "fortress of the mountain". The first evidence of human settlement are artifacts from the 11th century BC discovered in the valley beneath Castel del Monte and believed to be from an ancient necropolis. In the 4th century BC, Romans conquered the area and established "Città delle Tre Corone", the name meaning "town of the three crowns". This town was later abandoned after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and replaced by the fortified town of Ricetto in what is now the oldest part of Castel del Monte.
The first recorded mention of Castellum Del Monte came in 1223 in a papal bull by Pope Honorius III. In 1298, the Counts of Aquaviva took possession of the town. In 1474, it passed to Alessandro Sforza and a short time later to the Piccolominis. In 1501, forces loyal to Spain plundered Castel del Monte because of the town's allegiance to France.
In 1579, the Piccolominis ceded the village as part of the Baronage of Carapelle to Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The Medici, who governed the baronage for over a century-and-a-half, left their imprint on Castel del Monte. Among the Medici legacies to the town is the construction of Chiesa "Matrice" di San Marco in 1657, whose tower is one of the dominant architectural features of Castel del Monte; the painting of St. John the Baptist in the church of Madonna del Suffragio by Bernardino di Lorenzo di Monaldo (circa 1585) commissioned by Francesco de' Medici himself; and the diminutive Chiesa di San Rocco (1656).
The town’s massive defensive walls, largely formed by "wall houses", and its great gates, were also completed under this period of Medici rule.
In 1743, the baronage passed to Charles of Bourbon, then king of Naples and Sicily (later King Charles III of Spain). The village became part of Italy in 1861.
Population and economy.
According to the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (the Italian Statistical Institute), Castel del Monte's resident population on January 1, 2008 was just 463, well below the town’s population in earlier centuries.
Until recent times, Castel del Monte’s economic wellbeing has been tied to sheep farming. Between the 12th century and 16th century, the area was one of the most prolific wool producers in Europe. This prosperity continued until the end of the Transhumance, an annual sheep drive south to Apulia, which ceased in the 1850s. Though Castel del Monte continued to produce wool, pecorino cheese and lamb, the economy never recovered to its pre-1850s level and the town’s population steadily declined. This population decline accelerated in the second half of the 20th century when significant numbers of Castel del Monte's residents migrated to Wallonia, many to work in its coal mines. Others migrated to France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In recent years, former residents who emigrated to French-speaking countries and their children have been returning to Castel del Monte with more frequency for vacations and, in some cases, to retire.
Tourism is central to Castel del Monte’s economic hopes. The absence of economic development in the 20th century meant there was little new construction in Castel del Monte within the past 100 years. As a result, most structures in Castel del Monte are several centuries old, and many are little changed from the Middle Ages or Renaissance. The creation of Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga in 1993, which Castel del Monte lies entirely within, assures that the land surrounding the town will remain forever wild, thus preserving Castel del Monte in a near pristine state.
Castel del Monte's biggest tourist event is "La Notte delle Streghe" or "The Night of the Witches", an annual event for which the town is well-known. Held in mid-August, thousands visit the town for the late-night spectacle where the entire historic district serves as a stage for residents who play the roles of townspeople and witches in a folk drama in the local dialect known as "Castellano".
In 2006, Castel del Monte was named one of the "borghi più belli d'Italia", the most beautiful villages of Italy. In return for this honor, the town agreed to promote historic preservation and environmental protection. The town has also been recognized by the Slow Food movement for its sustainable agriculture, in particular its canestrato cheese.
Castel del Monte is the principal location of "The American", a suspense film, released September 1, 2010, directed by Anton Corbijn. The film's central character "Jack", played by George Clooney, holes up in Castel Del Monte hoping to escape from his past.

Forest of the Gods

Forest of the Gods (Lithuanian: "Dievų miškas") is a 2005 film, directed by Algimantas Puipa, based on the Balys Sruoga novel of the same name.
Plot.
The story about one man- an artist and an intellectual- who was imprisoned by two brutal regimes, the Nazis and the Soviets. 'The Professor' is a man who lives by his own personal version of the Ten Commandments. After miraculously surviving imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp through a bit of ironic fate, he writes a memoir of his life, which becomes the target of the Soviet censors. The so-called "freedom" of Communism becomes just as oppressive as the German concentration camp.
Criticism.
98-year old Vladislovas Telksnys, the only Lithuanian survivor of the Stutthof concentration camp in 2013, referred to the movie as "a piece of nonsense". In particular he referred to the scene depicting a Gestapo officer marching and a woman with an umbrella following behind. According to Telksnys, "there were no such things".

Castelvecchio Subequo (also Subrequo and Subrego; Latin: Superaequum or Superequum) is a "comune" and town in the province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region, central Italy, at the feet on Mount Sirente.
History.
Ancient Superaequum was a town of the Paeligni, one of the three which possessed municipal rights, and among which the territory of that people was divided. Hence it is mentioned both by Pliny and in the "Liber Coloniarum", where it is termed Colonia Superaequana. It received a colony of veterans, probably under Augustus, to which a fresh body of colonists was added in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The name is not mentioned by any other author, but several inscriptions attest its municipal importance. 
After the conquest of southern Italy by the Lombards, it was known as Onuffolo or Nuffoli, returning the its former name under the Normans. It accrued its other name (originally Castelvetere, meaning "old fort") later in the Middle Ages.
It is on a hill on the right bank of the Aterno river, and about on the left of the Via Valeria. Its territory probably comprised the hilly district between that road and the Aternus.

Cerchio

Cerchio is a "comune" and town in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy
Geography.
The village is situated on the lower slopes of Mt. Sirente, overlooking the Fucino plain. Present population is 1720, with 656 families. Patron saints of the town are S. Giovanni and S. Paolo (John and Paul).
History.
Local legend says that the town arose from a small group of houses constructed around a theater (circo) set up by the Romans to celebrate the inauguration of Emperor Claudius, who drained the ancient Fucine lake. The Church of S. Bartolomeo is mentioned in a papal bull of 1300. During the medieval period the village was held by the Colonna and Piccolomini families of Rome, who granted it to Camilla Peretti in 1591, along with the County of Celano and the Barony of Pescina. Over the centuries the Fucino plain was resubmerged, until it was drained in the mid-nineteenth century by Alessandro Torlonia, 2nd Prince di Civitella-Cesi. Families from Cerchio then farmed the rich soils of the lake bed, working as tenant farmers, share-croppers and day-laborers under the Torlonia Administration. The town was badly damaged by the earthquake of 1915.

Civita d'Antino

Civita d'Antino () is a "comune" and town in the province of L'Aquila, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy.
History.
Antinum, a city of the Marsians, was situated on a lofty hill in the upper valley of the Liri river (now called the Valle di Roveto), about from Sora and from the Lake Fucinus, from which it is, however, separated by an intervening mountain ridge. In antiquity, it is mentioned only by Pliny, who enumerates Antinum among the cities of the Marsians.
The numerous inscriptions that have been discovered in the modern village suggest that it must have been a municipal town of considerable importance. Besides these, there remain several portions of the ancient walls, of polygonal construction, with a gateway of the same style, which still serves for an entrance to the modern village, and is called Porta Campanile. The Roman inscriptions confirm the testimony of Pliny as to the city being a Marsic one (one of them has "populi Antinatium Marsorum"); but an Oscan inscription which has been found there is in the Volscian dialect, and renders it probable that the city was at an earlier period occupied by that people It has been supposed by some writers to be the "castellum ad lacum Fucinum" mentioned by Livy as conquered from that people in 408 BCE, although this has been disputed

Cocullo is a "comune" and town in the Province of L'Aquila, located in the Abruzzo region of Italy. As of 2007 its population was of 285.
Geography.
The village is situated in the Peligna Valley, between the towns of Avezzano and Sulmona. It is linked with them by the A25 motorway and the Rome-Pescara railway line.
It conuts a single civil parish ("frazione"), named Casale and borders with the municipalities of Anversa degli Abruzzi, Bugnara, Castel di Ieri, Castelvecchio Subequo, Goriano Sicoli, Ortona dei Marsi and Prezza.
History.
The origins of Cocullo are closely related to the Ancient Roman town of Koukoulon, situated between Cocullo village and Casale.
Snake Festival (Feast of San Domenico).
Cocullo is known for his singular patron saint's holiday, named "Festa dei Serpari", in which the patron saint's statue (Domenico di Sora) is transported in procession covered with lot of snakes (mainly four-lined, aesculapian, grass and green whip snakes). The reptiles themselves are transported in procession by local "serpari", a sort of "snake breeders", and released in the surrounding woods at the end of the holiday. The festival, set every first May since 2012 (in the past it took place every first Thursday in May), is a receptive event for thousands of Italian and foreign visitors. In 2009 it was cancelled due to some structural damages occurred into the village after the L'Aquila earthquake. This tradition, present also in coat of arms symbolism, substituted the ancient Roman mythologic ritual of Angitia, a snake goddess worshipped by the Marsi.

Sargable

In relational databases, a condition (or predicate) in a query is said to be sargable if the DBMS engine can take advantage of an index to speed up the execution of the query. The term is derived from a contraction of "Search ARGument ABLE".
A query failing to be sargable is known as Non-Sargable query and has an effect in query time, so one of the steps in query optimization is convert them to be sargable.
The typical situation that will make a sql query non-sargable is to include in the WHERE clause a function operating on a column value. Note that the WHERE clause is not the only clause where sargability can matter; it can also have an effect on ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. The SELECT clause, on the other hand, can contain non-sargable expressions without adversely affecting the performance.

Karen Hunter

Karen Hunter is an American journalist and publisher, and the coauthor of several books.
Education.
In 1987, Hunter received a B.A. in English Literature from Drew University.
Career.
Between 1996 and 1998, Hunter taught journalism at New York University.
Hunter served four years on the "New York Daily News"' seven-member editorial board. In 1999, she was a concurrent member of respective news teams that won the Pulitzer Prize and the Polk Award. Prior to that she was the paper’s first African-American female news columnists; she joined the newspaper as a sports writer in 1988, then wrote features and business stories. 
In January 2002, Hunter was appointed by the Hunter College administration as an Assistant Visiting Professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies and presently is a Distinguished Lecturer at Hunter College. She also was a morning radio talk show host for three years in New York City.
In 2006, she left her position as a morning talk show host on New York station (1600 AM) WWRL. Her departure followed the dissolution of an early morning team composed of her and WABC personality Steve Malzberg.
In 2007, she launched Karen Hunter Publishing, an imprint of Pocket Books/Simon & Schuster. She has published "Why Black Men Love White Women, Faith Under Fire, Love On A Two-Way Street, Recipes for a Good Life" with Patti Labelle, and epic griotsong "The Children of Children Keep Coming," with "Wall Street" pioneer Russell L. Goings. As a writer, Hunter has co-authored five New York Times bestsellers, among them books with Queen Latifah, Al Sharpton, Mason Betha, Karrine Steffans, LL Cool J, Wendy Williams, J. L. King, Donda West, Sandy Denton, Cedric the Entertainer, and Jonathan Plummer.
On January 31, 2007, Hunter appeared on CNN's "Paula Zahn Now" in a piece on atheists in America. During the open forum portion she made several controversial comments suggesting: "If they had Hallmark Cards, maybe they wouldn't feel so left out. We have Christmas cards. We have Kwanzaa cards now. Maybe they need to get some atheist cards and get that whole ball rolling so more people can get involved with what they're doing. I think they need to shut up and let people do what they do."
On April 11, 2011, on her Facebook page, Hunter called for a boycott of the television show "Celebrity Apprentice" in reactions to comments Donald Trump made about Barack Obama. She said in a later interview: "So many of us were angered and outraged by Trump’s comments and I wanted to let us know that we have power. We can do something besides grumble and complain." 
In 2012, Hunter disparagingly referred on MSNBC to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, remarking: "[Mitt Romney's not running for the presidency of the United States, maybe he's running for the presidency of 'Caucasia-stan' or some place that doesn't have anyone of color in it." 
Personal.
Hunter resides in Orange, New Jersey.

Hjulström curve

The upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are logarithmic. 
The plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for cohesive sediment, mostly clay but also silt, the "erosion" velocity increases with decreasing grainsize, as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the settling velocity, and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulström curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.
The curve was in 1956 expanded by Hjulström's disciple and successor as professor, Åke Sundborg. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation. The result is called the Sundborg diagram, or the Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram, in the academic literature.

Fontecchio

Fontecchio is a "comune" and town in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of Italy.
History.
There is archaeological evidence of the Roman settlement of Fonticulanum down on the Aterno river. In the Middle Ages a castle was built on top of the hill and the population moved up there. The condottiero Braccio da Montone ("Fortebraccio") (1368–1424) tried and failed to capture the castle in the 14th century.
Today you can see a wonderful and well conserved historical centre.
Many fragments of ancient monuments are displayed in the L'Aquila museum.

Molotschna

Molotschna Colony was a Ukrainian Mennonite settlement in what is now Zaporizhia Oblast in Ukraine. Today it is called Molochansk with a population of under 10,000. The settlement is named after the Molochna River which forms its western boundary. Today the land mostly falls within the Tokmatskyi and Chernihivskyi Raions. The nearest large city is Melitopol to the southwest of Molotschna.
Molotschna was founded in 1804 by Mennonite settlers from West Prussia and consisted of 57 villages. The city initially was called "Halbstadt" (Half-city). It was the second and largest settlement of Mennonites in the Russian Empire. With the retreat and deportation of Germans living in these villages at the end of World War II, that area is now populated largely by Ukrainians.
History.
After the first Mennonite colony within the Russian Empire, Chortitza, was founded in 1789, Mennonite visitors found the freedoms and free land of Southern Ukraine an attractive alternative in view of restrictions placed on them in West Prussia. The imperial Russian government wanted more settlers with the valuable agricultural and craft skills of the Mennonites. In 1800 Paul I of Russia enacted a Privilegium (official privileges) for Mennonites granting them exemption from military service "for all time." In West Prussia King Frederick William III was making it difficult for Mennonites to acquire land, because of their refusal to serve in the military. Another reason to immigrate was fear of the changes brought about by the French Revolution. Refuge in Russia was seen as a more secure alternative.
The first settlers, 162 families, came in 1803 to the existing Chortitza settlement and spent the winter there. The first villages were founded in 1804. The central Russian government set aside a tract of land for the settlers along the Molotschna River in the Taurida Governorate. The next year an additional group of about the same size arrived. Each family received of land. In contrast to the settlement of Chortitza, wealthy Mennonites also immigrated. They sold their farms, paid a 10% emigration tax and brought the remainder into Russian Empire. Arriving with superior farming skills and more wealth, new farms and businesses were created more easily than had been the case in Chortitza. The seaport city of Taganrog provided a convenient market for their dairy products in the early years and wheat, which became the dominant crop later.
Between 1803 and 1806, 365 families came to Molotschna. Further immigration was prevented during the Napoleonic Wars. Another 254 families came from 1819-20. After 1835 immigration to Molotschna ended, with about 1200 families totaling some 6000 people moving from Prussia. The settlement consisted of of land with 46 villages and total population of about 10,000. A part of this was not divided but reserved for future generations, to care for the growing number of families. As the population outgrew the available land, daughter colonies such as Neu Samara Colony were formed.
The settlement was located near Russian Empire's southern frontier and was thus subject to raids by nomadic Crimean Tatars who had been deported from the Molotschna Valley by the Russian government. After four Mennonites were killed by a raiding party, the imperial government banned their spiked and weighted pole weapon which they frequently used on hunting expeditions. Later Mennonites and their neighbors coexisted peacefully.
Local government.
Mennonite colonies were self-governing with little intervention from the central authorities in Moscow. The village, the basic unit of government, was headed by an elected magistrate who oversaw village affairs. Each village controlled its own school, roads and cared for the poor. Male landowners decided local matters at village assemblies.
Villages were grouped into districts. Molotschna was divided into two districts: Halbstadt and Gnadenfeld. A district superintendent headed a regional bureau that could administer corporal punishment and handle other matters affecting the villages in common. Insurance and fire protection were handled at the regional level, as well as dealing with delinquents and other social problems. The Mennonite colonies functioned as a democratic state, enjoying freedoms beyond those of ordinary Ukrainian peasants living in Southern Ukraine.
Education.
At a time when compulsory education was unknown in Europe, the Mennonite colonies formed an elementary school in each village. Students learned practical skills such as reading and writing German and arithmetic. Religion was included as was singing in many schools. The teacher was typically a craftsperson or herder, untrained in teaching, who fit class time around his occupation.
In 1820 the Molotschna colony started a secondary school at Ohrloff, bringing a trained teacher from Prussia. A school of commerce was started in Halbstadt employing a faculty with full graduate education. Those who wanted to pursue post-secondary education attended universities in Switzerland, Germany, as well as the Russian Empire.
Johann Cornies.
Johann Cornies was perhaps Molotschna's most noted resident. His large estate, "Jushanlee", was a model farm and showplace of Southern Ukraine. Crown princes of Russia, Alexander I and Alexander II, as well as other government officials visited the estate. His holdings were expanded by gifts from the government for his services and totaled at his death. He owned a large herd of thoroughbred cattle, 8000 merino sheep and four hundred horses.
Daughter colonies.
As the population of the colony grew and land became scarce, new areas for resettlement were sought. Starting in 1862 settlers from Molotschna formed daughter settlements in the peninsula of Crimea, which by 1926 consisted of 25 villages with a total population of 5000. In 1871 the Molotschna colony purchased to form the Zagradovka colony in Kherson Oblast. By 1918 Zagradovka was made up of 16 villages with 6000 residents.
In the 1870s the population pressure was eased somewhat when a significant portion of the colony migrated to North America. The next daughter colony was formed at Memrik in the Dnipropetrovsk region in 1885. By 1926 this settlement had a population of about 3500, occupying .
Selbstschutz.
Through influence of the short German occupation of Ukraine in 1918, the young men of Molotschna formed a self-defense group (Selbstschutz) for protection of the villages. German soldiers provided training and left weapons and ammunition behind when they left. Together with a neighboring Lutheran colony, they formed twenty companies totaling 2700 infantry and 300 cavalry, which held back the forces of the Ukrainian anarchist-communist leader Makhno until March 1919. When the Russian communist Red Army combined with Makhno, the self-defense group was forced to retreat to Halbstadt and disband. This attempt to defend the villages departed from the Mennonites' traditional teaching of nonresistance and was disapproved by many colonists. However, in the absence of effective governmental authority and when faced with the horrific atrocities committed by anarchist partisans, many others came to believe in the necessity of self-defence. Later church conferences and delegations officially condemned this action as a "grave mistake".
Famine.
Mennonites of Molotschna sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to coordinate aid.
The new organization planned to provide aid to Mennonites in Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in Istanbul. The Istanbul group, mainly Goshen College graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing Ukrainian Civil War. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt just as General Wrangel of the Russian Imperial White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while Clayton Kratz, who remained in Halbstadt as it was overrun by the Red Army, was never heard from again.
A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine. Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty Fordson tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. The cost of this relief effort was $1.2 million.
Evacuation.
The residents of Molotschna shared the fate of the Chortitza settlers. They were evacuated to Nazi Reichsgau Wartheland in 1943, and from there marched into Germany, only to be repatriated to the Soviet Union by the Red Army where they were exiled to Siberia and Kazakhstan.
Villages.
About 57 villages were founded:

Óscar de Paula

Óscar de Paula Gamero (born 31 May 1975) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker.
Most of his professional career was associated with Real Sociedad, for which he appeared in 11 La Liga seasons, playing in nearly 350 official games and scoring more than 60 goals.
Football career.
Born in Durango, Biscay, Basque Country, de Paula began his football career playing for lowly clubs in Badajoz, as his family hailed from Olivenza (Extremadura). Being still a junior he moved to local CD Badajoz and made his professional debuts midway through the 1992–93 season in the second division, remaining with the club for two additional campaigns.
At the beginning of 1995–96, de Paula moved back to his native region to play for La Liga side Real Sociedad. His first game came on 10 September 1995, playing three minutes of a 3–0 home win against Sporting de Gijón; he went on to play 11 seasons at Sociedad, all of them in the first division.
De Paula's time as a player for Real Sociedad was very successful although he was never a regular starter, more often than not scoring goals after coming in as a substitute, and usually made a good goals scored/minutes played ratio. Through 1999 to 2001 he netted nine goals in each season, but only appeared in 11 contests in 2002–03 as the club finished runner-up and, in his last year, managed just six matches (280 minutes) with three goals. 
In June 2006 de Paula's contract expired, and he left and moved south to Cádiz CF in the second-tier, "descending" yet another level at the end of 2007–08 after joining third level's SD Ponferradina and scoring 32 league goals in his first two seasons combined (16 apiece).
De Paula netted 11 times in 25 games in the 2009–10 campaign as the Castile and León team returned to the second division after a three-year absence. However, "Ponfe" would be immediately relegated back and, aged 36, he announced his professional retirement, having appeared in 444 league matches both major levels combined and scored 114 goals.

James E. O'Hara

James Edward O'Hara (b. 1844-1905) was an American politician and attorney who was the second African American to be elected to Congress from North Carolina. Born in New York City, he went South after the American Civil War with religious missionaries from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, an independent black denomination, to help the freedmen set up independent lives and new congregations. O'Hara decided to stay there and became active in politics, being elected to local and state offices. 
In 1871 he was the first man from North Carolina to get a law degree from Howard University; he passed the bar and started his practice. In 1882, O'Hara was elected as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, serving two terms, from 1883 to 1887. After being defeated in the 1886 election, he retired from politics when his term ended, and returned to his law practice.
Early life and education.
James O'Hara was born in New York City on February 26, 1844; his mother was West Indian, likely of mixed race; and his father was an Irish American merchant. Soon after James was born, his parents moved the family to the West Indies, where they lived into the 1850s before returning to New York.
Career in North Carolina.
After the American Civil War, O'Hara moved to North Carolina with missionaries of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, an independent black denomination founded in New York City. It was seeking to aid the freedmen and to plant new congregations of the independent church in the South. During his early years, he "read the law" as a legal apprentice. 
In 1871 James E. O'Hara was the first black from North Carolina to graduate in law at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, DC. He was admitted to the bar and returned to Enfield, North Carolina to start his law practice. He also started becoming involved in politics. 
Marriage and family.
O'Hara married in the state after setting up his law practice. He and his wife had several children, among them a son Raphael. Later Raphael also earned a law degree, and joined his father in his law practice, by then in New Bern, North Carolina. 
Political career.
After serving as clerk for the 1868 state convention that drafted a new state constitution during the Reconstruction era, O'Hara was elected as a Republican candidate to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1868-1869. 
O'Hara was admitted to the bar in 1871 and started a law practice. The next year, he was elected chairman of the Halifax County board of commissioners, serving 1872–1876.
Halifax and nearby counties of the northeast part of the state had black majorities, and were included within North Carolina's 2nd congressional district. By 1877 New Bern, the major population center, was a black-majority city. In the postwar period, many blacks had migrated from rural to urban areas to establish communities independent of white supervision. O'Hara was a member of the state constitutional convention of 1875, where he represented Halifax County.
New Bern residents elected blacks to the board of aldermen and the Craven County Commission, until the Democratic state legislature withdrew the county's authority to govern itself. The county continued to elect at least one black legislator each session to the state house for another decade, as did other majority-black counties in the northeast part of the state.
O'Hara competed for the congressional seat from the 2nd District numerous times. He narrowly lost the election in 1878 when another Republican candidate split the party vote. Although O'Hara contested the election of the Democrat, his evidence was lost when his house burned down.
In 1882, O'Hara was elected from North Carolina's 2nd congressional district as a Republican to the Forty-eighth Congress and was re-elected to the Forty-ninth Congress, serving from March 4, 1883 - March 3, 1887. He was the second African American to be elected to Congress from the state after John A. Hyman. While in Congress, O'Hara tried to secure compensation for freedmen who lost savings in the failure of the Freedmen's Savings and Trust Company, but was unsuccessful. 
Although he influenced the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, asserting that Congress could regulate passenger cars as well as freight traffic, O'Hara was unable to gain language requiring enforcement of integrated seating for the railroads. Congress allowed a loophole permitting segregated seating, although the railroads' interstate transportation was under federal oversight and should have been enforced constitutional rights. That year, O'Hara succeeded in amending the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia (which was then administered by the US Congress), in order to require that male and female teachers doing the same work and having the same certificates be paid equivalent salaries. Teachers of both races were then paid the same.
Because of Republican infighting in O'Hara's district, the vote in 1886 was split between another candidate and O'Hara. The Democrat Furnifold M. Simmons was elected by a plurality to the Fiftieth Congress. In 1900 the Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a constitutional suffrage amendment that effectively disfranchised blacks through making voter registration more difficult. This status lasted for most blacks in the state until passage in the mid-1960s of civil rights legislation to enforce their rights. 
After his defeat in 1886, O'Hara retired from political life. He resumed the practice of law in New Bern with his son Raphael. O'Hara died there on September 15, 1905, aged 61.

<doc id="5949144" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5949144" title="Karl May School">
Karl May School

Karl May School is a secondary school in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
History.
Founding.
In 1856, on the day of the Autumn Equinox (22 September), on the initiative of a few German families seeking to provide their children with a more applied secondary education than that available in the contemporary State educational institutions, a private German boy’s school was opened in a wing of building no. 56, 1st line, on Vasilievsky Island. It was led by Karl Ivanovich May (1820-1895), a talented professional educator and follower of the progressive educational views of A. Diesterweg, J. H. Pestalozzi, N. I. Pirogov, K. D. Ushinsky and F. Fröbel. In 1838, he had graduated with distinction from St. Peter’s Principal German College and in 1845 from the historical-philological faculty of the Imperial St-Petersburg University.
The First Years.
During its first years the school was elementary, consisting of three classes, but beginning in 1861 it received the official title of “Modern School Science College of Gymnasium Rank”, which reflected its intensively applied direction in advanced secondary education (in comparison to State educational institutions).
At the end of the 1850s one of the school performances opened with herald walking with flags emblazoned with May bugs; the director and all present were very pleased with this symbol. From that point on, attendees of this school have referred to themselves as "May bugs" for the rest of their lives.
Motto.
The principal motto of the school was a motto of the founder of modern pedagogics, Yan Amos Komensky: "First love, then teach". In accordance with this slogan, a collective of educators was formed, consisting only of people possessing high moral and professional qualities. The writer Lev Uspensky, a 1918 graduate of the school, remarked in his memoirs (paraphrased): "At May there are not and could not be educator-obscurantists, teacher-Black Hundred members, or bureaucrats in uniform. The instructors at May, generation after generation, were selected on the basis of their scholarly and educational gifts."
System.
The system of education and upbringing created by K.I. May stipulated mutual respect and trust in the teachers and students, constant cooperation with the family, and the aspiration of the educators to allow for and develop the individual abilities of each student and to teach them to think independently. All this, in combination with the high quality of education, allowed the school year after year to release highly moral, well-rounded youths, prepared for “work useful to society”. Thanks to the special atmosphere springing from this educational institution (called the “May spirit”), the K. May School was the “state within a state, separated by an endless ocean from State conventionalism” (aptly expressed by 1890 graduate D.V. Filosofov). Its participants, in terms of both social position and national identification, were quite diverse, without discrimination: Swiss children, sons of the princes Garin, Galitzine, the counts Olsufev and Stenbok-Fermor, representatives of the entrepreneur families Vargunin, Durdin, Elisseeff, Tortonov, and scions of the liberal intelligentsia Benois, Bruni, Grimm, Dobuzhinsky, Roerich, Rimsky-Korsakov, Semenov-Tyan-Shanskii, among others. Moreover, in many cases this school educated several generations of one family. Among these, the Benois dynasty holds a unique record: 25 members of this clan studied “at May”.
Students.
In this school, boys representing nearly all of the national diasporas of St Petersburg were educated — Russians, Germans, French, English, Tatars, Jews, Finns, Chinese, etc. In this way, as was already noted at the beginning of the 20th century, this school "could in no way be called monarchical, democratic, republican, or aristocratic. It always strove to be human."
Divisions.
From the very beginning the school consisted of two divisions. Children who appeared inclined towards the humanities were designated Latinists and in the initial years studied in that division, later to be renamed Gymnasium. Here, along with German and French, the ancient languages Latin and Greek were taught. Gymnasium students, having studied for nine years, as a general rule prepared for the continuation of their education at university. Young people more inclined towards the natural sciences were called non-Latinists: over the course of eight years in the natural science division they acquired a great quantity of knowledge of the exact sciences and prepared for engineering work. Until 1909 there also existed a small commercial division, in which English was studied instead of French. Thanks to this structure, in 1881 the official title of this secondary educational institution became “K. May Gymnasium and Natural Science College”.
For the first 25 years the school was German, which is to say that the lessons in all subjects except Russian language, literature and history, and a few natural science disciplines as well, were led in the language of Goethe.
From 1861 the school was located in building no. 13 on the 10th line. The first class of the natural science division was graduated in 1863, and of the Gymnasium, in 1865. In 1890 K.I. May handed over the reins of directorship to Vasilii Aleksandrovich Krakaw (1857-1935), an 1873 May graduate, who, having graduated from the historical-philosophical faculty of the university, taught history in his former school. Under his directorship the method of teaching was perfected, the natural science division developed, and the equipment of the classrooms and laboratories improved.
In 1906, after the retirement of V.A. Krakaw, the new director was a selected graduate of the historical-philosophical faculty, the magistrate of Slavic studies "Aleksandr Lavrentovich Lipovsky" (1867-1942). During the period of his leadership the educational institution experienced two important events. First of all, the school marked its fiftieth anniversary, and to mark the occasion published a unique jubilee collection of former students’ recollections. The second event resulted from the fact that with the school’s growing popularity, the space it occupied was beginning to be inadequate. In 1909 a part of building no. 39 on the 14th line was taken over, and according to the plan of master architect G.D. Grimm (an 1883 graduate), a unique new building was built with a bas-relief May bug above the arc of the entrance way. With a great concourse, the dedication took place on 31 October, 1910. It was led by the bishop Gdovskii and by Benjamin Ladozhskii, the future metropolitan of Petrograd.
In four floors, along with classrooms for 650 occupants, eight beautifully equipped specific-subject classrooms were built—for physics, chemistry, natural history, history, geography, drawing, modeling, and choir (three of these had auditoriums in the form of amphitheaters); there were additionally a carpentry studio, a library numbering 12 000 books in Russian, German, French, English, Latin and Greek, a sports hall and a cafeteria.
On the eve of the First World War, under the leadership of 38 highly qualified educators, 567 young men received their education here. There were many excursions, not only to famous Petersburg museums, but also to centers of production. Various circles were active: literary (publishing a printed paper, “The May collection”), historical, maritime, photographic, sporting, and aircraft-modeling (in which N.V. Fausek, a 1913 graduate, built the first model aircraft in Russia).
After the start of the war with Germany, the Emperor Alexander I/K. May Gymnasium and Natural Science College Field Hospital was opened in the school in September 1914; all the auxiliary duties were fulfilled by the students.
In the period comprising 1910-1917 the school truly blossomed. The last (fifty-fifth) graduation took place on 24 February 1918. Since 1856 the school had educated about 3800 Petersburg youths, 1300 of whom received the attestat degree. 15% of the graduates were awarded golden medals and 17% silver medals for exceptional academic success. According to the norms of the time, “realists” were not given medals.
This piece of history was described in greater detail for the first time in the book (published 1990) "The School on Vasilievskii", authored by several former “May-bugs”—academic D.S. Likhachev, school historian N.V. Blagovo, and literary theorist E. B. Belodubrovskii. To mark the 150th anniversary of the school, celebrated in 2006, N.V. Blagovo has published a second, extended edition of this book.
20th century.
In autumn 1918, the private educational institution of K.I. May was nationalized and turned into the Soviet United Labor School, 1st and 2nd degree. Here, according to the decrees of the new authorities, co-education was introduced, while grades and the attestat degree were abolished. Later the brigade-laboratory method of study was introduced and utilized until 1932.
In the pre-war years the director of the school, its name and number (15, 12, 217, 17), the length of study (seven, nine, or ten years) changed repeatedly (see appendix 2). The “May” pedagogical traditions were in one way or another preserved until the winter of 1929, when as a result of an extensive anti-bourgeois press campaign and the publication of unfounded accusations in the newspaper “Leningrad Pravda,” from 15 January 1929 the school’s educators and management were largely replaced—even the bas-relief above the entranceway was destroyed. In the beginning of the 1930s, "K.I. Polyakov" (1902-1946) became director of the school and recreated a good pedagogical collective; the life of the school was put to rights. The physical education instructor R.V. Ozol’, organizer of the “Spartak” circle, was an especially bright figure at this time. Pioneer and Komsomol organizations were also created.
Starting in the fall of 1937, in accordance with government resolution, the school also housed the 6th Special Artillery School (6 SAS), formed on a volunteer basis of students from the 8-10th classes of this and other nearby general education schools. Between 1938 and 1941 the 6 SAS graduated four classes. On 5 February 1942, during the cruel winter of the blockade, starving schoolchildren were evacuated to Tobolskt—nevertheless, 63 of them died of hunger on the way. Graduates of the 6 SAS distinguished themselves brilliantly on the fronts of he World War II, defended and liberated their native Leningrad, stormed Berlin and the Reichstag; 111 of them died courageously. Since 1984 in the current School no. 5 (13th line, no. 28) there has been a museum devoted to the 6 SAS, founded thanks to the efforts both of the school director at that time and of the current museum director L.V. Chernenkova. The museum directs the students in active patriotic work, with the aid of veterans, led by General-major V.G. Rozhkov.
After the lifting of the Leningrad blockade, from September 1944, lessons were begun again, only now the educational institution was called the Men’s High School no. 5 (and from 1954, with the institution of co-education, simply High School no. 5). In 1966, on the initiative of the director of studies A.S. Baturina, a museum was created in the school. Along with the expositions devoted to the labor and military works of former students, there was a stand devoted to the pre-revolutionary period and the school’s first director, K.I. May. However, this museum did not exist for very long, and, sadly, almost none of its exhibits were preserved.
In connection with a collapse of ceiling plaster in 1976 (requiring a renovation), the collective of educators and students were temporarily moved to another building on the 13th line (no. 28). The renovation was not completed due to lack of funds, and school activities were not reinstated in the old building. All the unique classroom equipment, the furniture, memorial plaques with the names of former graduates of various years, busts of writers and scholars, and the decorated interiors were left to the whims of fate. All of it was quickly plundered and irretrievably lost.
Graduates of the school achieved great successes in various branches of science and culture. More than 100 of them became Doctors of Science, 29 were elected active members or member-correspondents of the Academy of Science or the Academy of the Arts (see list below). Among other former students: three members of the State council of pre-revolutionary Russia—University rector D.D. Grimm, Petersburg governor A.D. Zinov’ev and Minister of Internal Affairs, later Minister of Justice A.A. Makarov; Minister of Internal Affairs D.S. Sipyagin; University rector E.D. Grimm; Technological Institute rector N.A. Bartels; military leaders—infantry general N.A. Epanchin; general-majors S.V. Belov, V.V. Volkov, V.G. Rozhkov; vice-admiral E.I. Volobuyev; contra-admirals V.A. Petrovskii, P.V. Rimskii-Korsakov, I.V. Kossovich; cultural figures—members of the association “The World of art” A.N. Benois, N.K. Roerich, V.A. Serov, K.A. Somov, A.E. Yakovlev, as well as O.G. Vereysky, P. Ya. Pavlinov, I.A. Puni, S. N. Roerich, the sculptor B.E. Kaplyanskii, the composers V.I. Tsytovich, F.D. Shevtsov, the writers G.I. Alekseev, V.S. Golovinskii, V.A. Knekht, A.A. Liverovskii, V.V. Uspenskii, L.V. Uspenskii, O.A. Khazin, F.K. Einbaum, the poet Yu. A. Liverovskii, the theatre figures F. N. Kurikhin, P.P. Podervyanskii, and M.F. Stronin. Two-time Hero of the Soviet Union, doctor of physics and mathematics, cosmonaut and former May student G.M. Grechko also warmly remembered the school. We should also mention that O.D. Khvolson was one of the first to be given (in 1926) the title “Hero of labor”, and that three graduates—V.V. Volkov, D.S. Likhachev, and V.V. Novozhilov—were distinguished with the title “Hero of socialist labor”. Five other graduates—V.V. Belomorets, M.A. Elyashevich, L.L. Kerber, V.D. Nalivkin, and V.V. Novozhilov—became laureates of the Lenin Prize.
From 1978 to the present day, the former school building has been occupied by the St. Petersburg Institute of Information Technology and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The director of the Institute,Professor-Emeritus of science and technology of the Russian Federation and doctor of technological sciences, member-correspondents of the Academy of Science R.M Yusupov, with the active support of T.I Golubeva, then head of Administration of Education and Culture of the Vasilievskii district—in 1994 made the decision to create a museum of the history of the K.I. May School.
On a clear cool day, 12 May 1995, the oldest living student, the academic D.S. Likhachev unveiled a memorial plaque—the bas-relief of a May bug, recreated by the museum and the sculptor S.N. Smirnov. After two days one more plaque appeared on the building, immortalizing the memory of the presence of the 6th Special Artillery School. The museum, which is located in the former hall of the school’s educational council, boasts an exhibit of 15 showcases and 25 stands, reflecting all of the founding stages of the school’s 150-year history.
In the following years the museum tripled in size, and its archives now contain more than 4000 preserved items: objects, documents, photographs, audio- and videocassettes. For the museum's 10-year anniversary, in 2005, the N.K. Rerikh Art School donated a bust of K.I. May, sculpted by I.V. Volle. During this period about 500 groups—consisting of schoolchildren, educators, scholars, representatives of various associations, ordinary residents of Petersburg and other Russian cities, as well as guests from Linz, London, New York, Paris, Seoul, Sofia, Torino, Ulan-Bator and even Sydney and Brisbane were introduced to the history of the school and left grateful messages in the visitor's book.

Elliott Hundley

Elliott Hundley (born 1975) is an American artist, living and working in Los Angeles. 
Hundley earned an MFA in the Department of Painting and Drawing at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2005, with a 1997 BFA in printmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design. He also attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2002, and had fellowships from the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, MA, the Vermont Studio Center, and Bemis Center for Contemporary Art in Omaha, NE.
Hundley's work has been exhibited at Daniel Reich Gallery, New York, the Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York and various venues in Los Angeles, including group exhibitions at Peres Projects. Hundley has been part of the LAXed exhibition at the Peres Projects Berlin in April 2006 and the Hammer Museum in May 2006. His work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Judith Rothschild Foundation Collection at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Guggenheim Museum, New York. 
"Hundley's compositions are delicately balanced and formally elaborate. The ghosts of Robert Rauschenberg's combines permeate these constructions. Color shifts between flamboyant and subtle, from intensely saturated to whispered tonalities...Textures may vary between tender and silken to prickly and menacing. Gravity is defied and exposed...In Hundley's assemblages, time—ancient and contemporary—spills forward and backward, one condition fusing into the other. A state of grace, before the fall, remains an echo, a still palpable presence, against the cacophony of history."

Dr Williams's Library

Dr Williams's Library is a small research library located in Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, London.
History.
It was founded using the estate of Dr Daniel Williams (1643–1716) as a theological library, intended for the use of ministers of religion, students and others studying theology, religion and ecclesiastical history. Several of its first directors were ministers associated with Newington Green Unitarian Church. The library opened in 1729 at Red Cross Street with its original benefaction of around 7600 books from Williams. Its site moved frequently, until the acquisition of its present home, University Hall in Gordon Square, in 1890. It has always had close ties with the Unitarians, and when a Doodlebug destroyed Essex Hall, the headquarters of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the Library offered a few spare rooms to displaced workers. They stayed for 14 years, until 1958.
Holdings.
In addition to its theological holdings, the library contains collections of philosophy, history, literature, and related subjects. There is also a large collection of works on Byzantine history and culture bequeathed by Professor Norman H. Baynes (1877–1961). In 1976, it acquired the library of New College London.
The library is known to researchers of history and genealogy for its holdings of pre-19th century material relating to Protestant nonconformity in England, including papers by Dissenting minister Joshua Toulmin, D.D. It holds the manuscript of a 17th-century diary written by Roger Morrice (1628–1702), an English Puritan minister and political journalist. It covers the years 1677 to 1691, and in 2007 the Boydell Press published a six volume edition of "Roger Morrice's Entring Book". The library also has many manuscripts of Philip Doddridge (1702 – 1751), a Nonconformist leader, educator, and hymnwriter, including letters between Doddridge and his wife, his wife's diary and some of his artifacts.
On 13 July 2006 the library offered for sale at Sotheby's its copy of Shakespeare's First Folio. The book sold for a hammer price of £2.8 million. The library's director, Dr David Wykes, commented:
Amongst its aims was that, for a small fee, it kept a central registry of births mainly (but not solely) within non-conformist families, to avoid the necessity of having to have a child baptised in the Anglican church. It had variable success; up to 49,000 births were registered there until after a few months of the General Register Office for England and Wales starting up in 1837, following the Births and Deaths Registration Act the previous year. These registers are now at The National Archives under class RG5 and indexed in RG4.

Charlie Robison

Charles Fitzgerald "Charlie" Robison (born September 1, 1964) is an American country music singer/songwriter. His brother, Bruce Robison, and his sister, Robyn Ludwick, are also singer/songwriters.
Career.
After an injury in college ended a potential football career, Charlie Robison came to Austin, Texas in the late 1980s and had stints in the bands Chaparral, Millionaire Playboys, and Two Hoots and a Holler. He went solo with his album "Bandera" in 1996. He subsequently signed with Sony and released "Life of the Party" on Sony's subsidiary Lucky Dog Records. The album gave him three of his biggest hits including "My Hometown." His next release was a live disc called "Unleashed Live," which is credited to Charlie, brother Bruce, and Jack Ingram. He then signed with Columbia Records for "Step Right Up" and another live album. 
In 2003, Robison was a judge on the first season of the TV singing competition "Nashville Star".
Unhappy with the expectations & limitations of being a Nashville country artist, he moved to a smaller independent label, Dualtone, for "Good Times" in 2004, followed by extensive touring and newfound control over his career. Accordingly, his sound began to evolve away from mainstream/Nashville country and toward more Southern & hard rock influences.
Five years after the release of "Good Times", Robison released "Beautiful Day" on June 23, 2009 on Dualtone. This is the first CD he has self-produced. Both albums feature several songs written by Nashville singer/songwriter Keith Gattis.
His song "Good Times" was featured in the credits of HBO's original series "True Blood" in the first season's third episode.
In 2009 he embarked on an East Coast tour with stops in Little Rock, Nashville, Atlanta, Raleigh, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Iowa City, and Memphis to promote "Beautiful Day." Since then he has played primarily in Texas, with occasional shows in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. 
He is known for playing classic rock covers during his live shows. Some of these include: "You Shook Me All Night Long" and "Highway to Hell" (AC/DC), "Call me the Breeze" (JJ Cale), "Rocket Man" (Elton John), and several Rolling Stones songs, including "Dead Flowers" and "Honky Tonk Women." He also plays several songs associated with Willie Nelson, including "Whiskey River" and "Stay all Night."
His live band includes: Mark Tokach (lead guitar), Abe Combest (drums), Louis Landry (keyboards/accordion), and Chris Grady (bass). Most of his recordings feature The Enablers: Keith Robinson (drums) and Scott Esbeck (bass). Other notable ex-band members include Kim Deschamps (pedal steel, lep steel, mandolin, guitar from 2000–2009), Kevin Carroll (guitar), Jens Pinkernell (guitar), and Kris Brown (bass). His recordings have also featured special guests Lloyd Maines (who produced Step Right Up and Good Times), Rich Brotherton, Charlie Sexton, and Natalie Maines (duet on "The Wedding Song" and harmony vocals on El Cerrito Place).
Family.
He married Emily Erwin of The Dixie Chicks in 1999. They have three children together: Charles Augustus, called "Gus", born November 11, 2002 Charlie and Emily divorced on August 6, 2008 after nine years of marriage.

Jeep-Eagle

Jeep-Eagle was the name of the automobile sales division created by the Chrysler Corporation after the US$2 billion takeover of American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. The division marketed a variety of vehicles until 1997.
History.
The Jeep-Eagle Division was basically the remains of American Motors after being acquired by Chrysler. The first group vice president was Joseph Cappy, who previously held the post of AMC president and chief executive officer. 
The new organization was responsible for continuing the promotion, sales, and product engineering for Jeep and the remaining AMC vehicles. It was a method to absorb nearly 1,200 American Motors dealers into Chrysler's distribution system and have them "meet stronger quality standards". The new division gave Chrysler three dealer organizations because state franchise laws prevented Chrysler from merging the AMC dealer network into its existing Chrysler-Plymouth or Dodge franchise systems, as well as preventing the sale of existing Chrysler products through AMC dealers. 
The new owner dropped the legacy line of AMC cars (the Renault Alliance and Encore) and AMC's dealers continued to market and service the popular Jeep light-truck brand, the Medallion captive import, as well as the new Premier. The newly established Jeep-Eagle Division business strategy was to increase Jeep production and focus more money on marketing. The new "Eagle marketing umbrella" also marketed versions of vehicles produced by Diamond-Star Motors.
Chrysler hoped to make Jeep-Eagle their "specialty division," selling products distinctly different from the K-car-based products. The Eagle passenger cars were supposed to try and capture import buyers. However, they evolved from the innovative, full-sized Premier and the imported mid-sized Medallion into a hodgepodge of cars developed between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. Eventually, many Eagle-branded automobiles were duplicated at Dodge and Chrysler-Plymouth dealerships. Chrysler made a good-faith effort to give the Eagle brand an identity by offering an all wheel drive (AWD) Eagle Talon, basically a badge engineered Mitsubishi Eclipse AWD, however sales were hindered by marketing missteps.
The Jeep half of the division, however, remained the better-known and more popular brand. Chrysler latched on to the Jeep heritage and advertisements featured Lee Iacocca assured that after Chrysler took over AMC, that "we won't fool around with an American institution. Jeep will stay Jeep. That's a promise." Many of the long-established AMC/Jeep dealers considered the new Eagle line of passenger cars to be less profitable than their Jeep business. American Motors had phased out domestic-built rear-wheel-drive passenger cars after 1983 and their captive front-wheel-drive imports did not achieve sales successes. Thus, AMC/Jeep dealer sales and service expertise was focused on the four-wheel drive Jeeps and AMC's Eagle AWD models.
The objective of the Eagle Division was to target consumers that “are young, independent-minded, educated and affluent-baby boomers and their younger brothers and sisters, Generation X." However, Eagle customers purchased similar Dodge, Plymouth, or Chrysler vehicles; thus, according to the automaker, the decline in Eagle models no longer justified the investment required to maintaining the brand.Although Chrysler had planned to redesign the Eagle Vision for 1999, production continued only into September 1997. The model was later marketed as the Chrysler 300M as the decision to drop the Eagle brand was already made.
Jeep became a stand-alone division when the Eagle brand was retired shortly after Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz in 1998, and efforts were made to merge the Chrysler and Jeep brands as one sales unit. Dealers with only the Chrysler franchise did not have a sport utility vehicle (SUV) to sell. Incorporating the Jeep line allowed them to compete in this popular market segment. While adding Jeep vehicles to Chrysler cars helped individual dealerships, it also eliminated the need to continue the Eagle brand.

Financial Consumer Agency of Canada

The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) is an independent agency of the Government of Canada that enforces consumer protection legislation, regulations and industry commitments by federally regulated financial entities. It also provides programs and information to help consumers understand their rights and responsibilities when dealing with financial institutions and promotes financial literacy.
Mandate.
FCAC has a dual mandate, set out in the "Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act". Broadly, these two main elements are: 
Under its compliance mandate, FCAC is responsible for:
Under financial literacy, FCAC is responsible for:
Scope.
FCAC monitors and supervises financial institutions and external complaints bodies that are regulated under federal legislation. These entities include all banks and federally incorporated or registered insurance, trust and loan companies, retail associations, federal credit unions and external complaints bodies. FCAC also supervises payment card network operators to determine whether they are in compliance with the provisions of the "Payment Card Networks Act".
FCAC does not regulate foreign bank representative offices, fraternal benefit societies or cooperative credit associations.
A complete list of federally regulated financial institutions is available from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). 
As a regulatory agency, FCAC can exercise its enforcement powers to ensure that federally regulated financial entities comply with the consumer provisions of the various federal acts relating to financial services, including:
In cases of contravention or non-compliance with legislation, FCAC notifies the federally regulated financial entity of a violation. Depending on the severity and frequency of the problem, the Agency may also:
History.
The Agency was established in 2001 by the federal government to strengthen oversight of consumer issues and expand consumer education in the financial sector. 
FCAC’s creation was one in a series of initiatives resulting from an extensive period of study and public consultation on financial sector reform.
In December 1996, the Government of Canada launched the Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector, one of several initiatives following extensive debate and consultation on reform of the financial sector.
In September 1998, the Task Force presented the federal government with its report, "Change, Challenge, Opportunity" (known as the MacKay Report). One of the Task Force’s findings was that “the current framework for consumer protection is not as effective as it should be in reducing the information and power imbalance between institutions and consumers.” Two parliamentary committees reviewed the Task Force Report, held public consultations across the country and presented their own recommendations.
A broad consensus on ways to improve the financial sector emerged through this process. In June 1999, the government released a policy paper, "Reforming Canada’s Financial Services Sector: A Framework for the Future", containing 57 reform measures. Among them was a proposal to create a financial consumer agency to oversee consumer interests and improve consumer protection. Legislation to implement the reform package was passed on June 14, 2001.
The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada opened its doors in 2001 under the "Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act".
In its first year, FCAC established a website and a call centre for consumers to make complaints and ask questions about their rights and responsibilities regarding financial products and services.
In 2007, the Government of Canada provided FCAC with an additional $3 million for the creation of the Financial Literacy Initiative.
In 2009, new federal legislation gave FCAC oversight over payment card network operators. 
On July 11, 2010, amendments to the "Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act" further expanded FCAC’s role in four areas:
As a result of amendments to the "Bank Act" in 2010 which provided for federally regulated credit unions, FCAC became responsible for supervising and monitoring such credit unions’ compliance with applicable legislation and regulations.
In August 2010, the "Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card Industry" came into force. FCAC opened its new Research Branch as part of its expanded mandate.
In 2011, the Task Force on Financial Literacy released its recommendations. The Commissioner of FCAC also became the interim Chair to Financial Consumer Protection Network (FinCoNet) in May 2011.
November 2011 was the first Financial Literacy Month. FCAC, together with a group of community organizations called the Financial Literacy Action Group (FLAG), organized workshops and other events across Canada to promote financial literacy among consumers.
Organization.
FCAC is headed by a Commissioner, appointed for a five-year term. The Commissioner reports annually to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Finance, on the Agency's activities and on the performance of financial institutions in complying with consumer protection measures. 
The first Commissioner was Bill Knight, a former senior executive and Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons. He retired in 2006.
Ursula Menke was appointed Commissioner on December, 2007. Before her mandate at FCAC, Ms. Menke held various positions giving her more than 30 years' experience in financial and legal affairs in both the public and private sectors, including the Privy Council Office, the Department of Finance and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
The current Commissioner, Lucie Tedesco, was named on September 4, 2013 for a term of up to five years. Prior to this appointment, Ms. Tedesco was Deputy Commissioner, a post she has held since June 2008.
Compliance and enforcement.
Under its compliance and enforcement mandate, the Agency investigates cases of non-compliance with consumer protection measures as set out in Canadian legislation. FCAC identifies potential cases using consumer complaints, as well as through the inquiries and investigations of its officers. The Agency's commissioner can impose a variety of penalties on institutions found to be in violation of consumer measures, including monetary penalties and public naming of the institution.
FCAC's Commissioner reports to Parliament annually with an assessment of federally regulated institutions' compliance with legislation.
Consumer education.
Under its consumer education mandate, FCAC produces publications and resources related to understanding and managing personal finances and financial products and services.
FCAC’s website makes available to consumers more than 60 different online publications, tip sheets and other resources along with interactive tools that help consumers find the financial products and services that best suit their needs.
FCAC offers different financial education programs aimed at a wide range of age groups, including resources to help high school students prepare themselves to handle the financial realities of adulthood, financial workshops for young adults, and learning programs to help adults manage their personal finances.

Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre

The Oriental Theatre is a theater located at 24 West Randolph Street in the Loop area of downtown Chicago, Illinois. Opened in 1926 as a deluxe movie palace, today the Oriental is operated by Broadway In Chicago, a subsidiary of the Nederlander Organization. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as New Masonic Building and Oriental Theater.
History.
The Oriental Theatre opened in 1926 as one of many ornate movie palaces built in Chicago during the 1920s by the firm Rapp and Rapp. It was built on the same location as the former Iroquois Theatre (later the Colonial Theatre) site of a disastrous 1903 fire that claimed over 600 lives, although the façade looks identical, and despite statements to the contrary, the Oriental retained nothing from the building that once stood on the same site.
The Oriental continued to be a vital part of Chicago's theater district into the 1960s, but patronage declined in the 1970s along with the fortunes of the Chicago Loop in general. Late in the decade, the theater survived by showing exploitation films. It closed in 1981 and was vacant for more than a decade.
The Oriental is one of several houses now operating in Chicago's revitalized Loop Theater District. According to Richard Christiansen, the opening of the Oriental spurred on the restoration of other theaters in The Loop.
The district is also home to the Cadillac Palace Theatre, Bank of America Theatre (formerly The Shubert Theatre), the Goodman Theatre, and the Chicago Theatre. Randolph Street was traditionally the center of downtown Chicago's entertainment district until the 1960s when the area began to decline. The now demolished United Artists Theatre, Woods Theatre, Garrick Theater, State-Lake Theatre and Roosevelt Theatre were located on or near Randolph Street.
Architecture.
The architects of the Oriental were George L. and Cornelius W. Rapp, who also built the Palace and Chicago Theatres. The Oriental features decor inspired by the architecture of India. The 3,250-seat theater was operated by the city's dominant theater chain, Balaban and Katz (a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures).
Restoration.
On January 10, 1996, Canadian theatrical company Livent announced it acquired the property and would renovate the structure with an anticipated completion date of 1998. The city of Chicago pledged $13.5 million toward the restoration and Ford Motor Company entered into a sponsorship agreement with Livent for a reported $1 million annual fee.
However in 1997, Livent's fortunes turned and the company began to lose money. In November 1998, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US and the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of its assets to SFX Entertainment.
The restored theater reopened October 18, 1998, with a reconfigured seating capacity of 2,253. The restored venue now hosts touring Broadway shows. The theater's full name is The Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre; however it is commonly called simply the Oriental Theatre. 
During the restoration, architect Daniel P. Coffey created a design plan that would increase the theater's backstage area by gutting the adjacent Oliver Building while preserving one-third of its original steel structure, as well as the building's Dearborn façade and a portion of its alley façade.
SFX's corporate successor, Live Nation, sold the Oriental Theatre to the Nederlander Organization in 2007.
General Interest.
The venue presented both movies and vaudeville acts during its early years, but by the 1930s it became predominantly a movie house, though live performances and concerts continued. Duke Ellington and his orchestra made frequent appearances at the Oriental.
In October 1934, 12-year-old Frances Gumm and her sisters performed at the theater but received laughs when George Jessel would introduce them as The Gumm Sisters. At his urging, they changed their name to The Garland Sisters after his friend, New York Times critic Robert Garland. "Frances Garland" would later change her first name, to become Judy Garland.
The Oriental Theatre is referenced at the beginning of the 1958 film "Auntie Mame".
Performers.
Many other stars also performed at the Oriental including: Fanny Brice, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Cab Calloway, Eddie Cantor, Bing Crosby, Alice Faye, Stepin Fetchit, Ella Fitzgerald, Ana Gasteyer, Jean Harlow, Billie Holiday, Bob Hope, Al Jolson, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, The Marx Brothers, Frank Sinatra, The Three Stooges, Sophie Tucker, Sarah Vaughan and Henny Youngman.
Notable Productions.
The theater re-opened in 1998 with the Chicago premiere of the musical "Ragtime". From June 2005 through January 2009, the theater housed a sit-down production of "Wicked", making it the most popular stage production in Chicago history. "Wicked" exceeded expectations, according to producer David Stone: "To be honest, we thought it would run eighteen months, then we'd spend a year in Los Angeles and six months in San Francisco." The venue hosted the pre-Broadway run of "The Addams Family", starring Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth from November 13, 2009 through January 10, 2010 and a production of the 2009 Tony Award winner for Best Musical "Billy Elliot" starring, among others, Cesar Corrales as Billy from March 18 to November 28, 2010.

2004 Chadian coup d'état attempt

The 2004 Chadian coup d'état attempt was an attempted coup d'état against the Chadian President Idriss Déby that was foiled on the night of May 16, 2004.
Plot.
The coup attempt was at first presented by the government as a fairly contained military mutiny over pay and conditions of service, with the Information Minister Moktar Wawadajab assuring the BBC that the mutiny had ended without a shot being fired, and that no-one was killed or injured. While the rebellion was rapidly quelled by loyalist forces after a brief exchange of fire, and the about 80 rebels and their ringleader, the army Colonel Bechir Haggar, were arrested, the President later admitted the seriousness of what had happened. In a televised address to the nation on May 18 Déby confirmed that elements of the GNNT and of the Presidential Guard had made an attempt on his life: "A group of fanatic and manipulated officers tried to disrupt the functioning of republican institutions on the night of May 16 … Their hidden agenda was the assassination of the President."
Motivations.
The possible reasons behind the failed coup are judged to be mainly two by observers. The first of these, and the most evident, is linked to the decision by Déby to search a third presidential mandate, modifying the Constitution with the help of the solid majority he could count on in the National Assembly; precisely in the day of the coup the necessary constitutional amendments were being rushed through the Parliament. This generated strong tensions in the inner circles of power, especially among the Zaghawa, Déby's ethnic group; and the coup saw the participation of senior Zaghawa officers, and important political allies of Déby were thought to have been involved, like Daoussa Déby, half-brother of the President, and the Erdimi twins, Tom and Timam, nephews of Déby. The suspicions regarding Daoussa Déby were to prove groundless, while on December 12, 2005 the Erdimi brothers were accused by the government of being the true masterminds behind the failed coup. The two were also to be the key architects in yet another coup d'état attempt that took place in 2006.
Another possible reason may be linked to Déby's foreign policy decisions regarding the Darfur conflict; in the conflict involving the Darfur rebels and the Sudan-supported Janjaweed, at the time Déby was attempting to maintain good relations with Sudan, a choice that made many Senior Chadian officers unhappy, many of whom were reportedly supporting the insurgents logistically, politically and financially. Relations with Sudan were to worsen dramatically the following year, leading to the Chadian-Sudanese conflict.

Samuel B. Fuller

Samuel B. Fuller (June 4, 1905 — October 24, 1988) was an American entrepreneur. He was founder and president of the Fuller Products Company, publisher of the New York Age and Pittsburgh Courier, head of the South Side Chicago NAACP, president of the National Negro Business League, and a prominent black Republican.
S.B. Fuller's life was an illustration of business success and self-help. His company gave inspiration and training to countless aspiring entrepreneurs and future leaders, including John H. Johnson of Johnson Publishing, George Ellis Johnson founder of Johnson Products, and Dr. T.R.M. Howard.
Early life.
Fuller (no relation to Alfred C. Fuller, founder of the Fuller Brush Company) was born into rural poverty to a sharecropper family in Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana in 1905. The family's poverty was such that he had to drop out of school in sixth grade. At nine he was selling products door-to-door and gaining experience as an entrepreneur. At fifteen his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Two years later his mother would pass away leaving seven children to fend for themselves.
After going to Chicago in 1928, Fuller worked in a wide range of menial jobs, eventually rising to become manager of a coal yard. Subsequent to his employment in the coal yard, he gained employment as an insurance representative for Commonwealth Burial Association, an African-American firm. Although he had a secure job during the depression, he nevertheless struck out on his own preferring “freedom” to “security.”
Entrepreneurship.
His career as an entrepreneur started after he borrowed twenty-five dollars using his car as collateral. Along with his friend Lestine Thornton (who later became his wife), he invested in a load of soap from Boyer International Laboratories, manufacturer of Jean Nadal Cosmetics and HA Hair Arranger. His success selling soap door-to-door inspired him to invest another $1000. He incorporated Fuller Products in 1929. In four years he would be promoted to a manager at Commonwealth while continuing to grow his own company to a line of 30 products and hiring additional door-to-door salespeople.
The substantial number of African American families who moved to the South side of Chicago during the Great Migration became the customer base from which Fuller Products would see tremendous expansion. The additional growth was sufficient for the company to open its own factory in 1939. In 1947, Fuller purchased Boyer to prevent its bankruptcy, keeping his ownership a secret. The company began to manufacture and sell a diverse line of commodities from deodorant and hair care to hosiery and men’s suits. Fuller also purchased several newspapers including the "New York Age" and the "Pittsburgh Courier". Additionally, he owned the South Center Department Store and the Regal Theater in Chicago.
Politics.
Fuller was a leading black Republican although he always had an independent streak. He promoted civil rights and briefly headed the Chicago South Side NAACP. Along with Birmingham businessman, A.G. Gaston, he tried to organize a cooperative effort to purchase the segregated bus company during the Montgomery Bus Boycott. He told Martin Luther King Jr., “The bus company is losing money and willing to sell. We should buy it.” King was skeptical of the idea, and not enough blacks came forward to raise the money.
Despite his belief in civil rights, Fuller’s emphasis was always on the need for blacks to go into business. In 1958, he blasted the federal government for undermining free enterprise and fostering socialism. He feared that it was “doing the same thing today as was done in the days of Caesar--destroying incentive and initiative.” He argued that wherever “there is capitalism there is freedom.”
Fuller was a good friend and associate of Dr. T.R.M. Howard from Mississippi and later Chicago. Howard was a wealthy black entrepreneur and a prominent civil rights leader and mentor to Medgar Evers. Fuller and Howard had probably met because of their mutual involvement in the National Negro Business League. Fuller was president of the organization for several terms in the 1940s and 1950s. He hired Howard to be medical director of Fuller Products and supported his Republican campaign for Congress in 1958.
Change of fortune.
During the 1950s, Fuller was probably the richest African American man in the United States. His cosmetics company had $18 million in sales and a sales force of five thousand (one third of them white). It gave training to many future entrepreneurs and other leaders. “It doesn’t make any difference,” he declared, “about the color of an individual’s skin. No one cares whether a cow is black, red, yellow, or brown. They want to know how much milk it can produce.”
Despite his opinion, the White Citizens Councils organized a boycott of Fuller's Nadal products line during the 1950s, when they learned an African American owned the company. This would be the beginning of a turn of fortune for Fuller's business interests that would affect his activities throughout the 1960s.
In 1963 Fuller was the first African American inducted into the National Association of Manufacturers. During his acceptance speech he stated that "a lack of understanding of the capitalist system and not racial barriers was keeping blacks from making progress." In an interview that same year with U.S. News and World Report he said, "Negroes are not discriminated against because of the color of their skin. They are discriminated against because they have not anything to offer that people want to buy." Afterwards his company suffered severe setbacks as many of his comments were reported out of context. Major national black leaders reacted angrily and called for a boycott of Fuller Products.
In 1968, Fuller sold unregistered promissory notes in interstate commerce for which he was charged with violating the Federal Securities Act. After pleading guilty, being placed on five years' probation, and ordered to repay creditors $1.6 million, Fuller Products entered bankruptcy in 1971. Although the company reorganized, reported profits of $300,000 in 1972, and the cosmetics portion of the old company was rebuilt, it never returned to the firm's previous levels of size or profitability.
In 1976, Fuller, as a result of health problems, asked his top distributor, Joe Louis Dudley, Sr., to move to Chicago and become President of the Fuller Products Company. Dudley ran both Fuller Products Company and Dudley Products Company from 1976 until 1984. In 1984, Fuller Products Company was purchased by Dudley.
Fuller was eighty-three years of age when he died at St. Francis Hospital in Blue Island, Illinois from kidney failure.

Quadrille (play)

"Quadrille" is a play by Noël Coward. The romantic comedy premiered in 1952 and starred Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt. It played on Broadway in 1955, where Lunt won a Tony Award for his performance.
History.
After a provincial tour beginning at the Manchester Opera House on 15 July 1952, the play opened at the Phoenix Theatre in London on 12 September 1952 and ran until 27 June 1953. The play starred Coward's friends Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt, with Griffith Jones, Marian Spencer and Sylvia Coleridge. It was moderately successful but failed to match the popularity of his pre-war hits.
"The Manchester Guardian" praised the play for breaking away from Coward’s customary terse style and experimenting with romantic comedy "affectionate and sincere as well as amusing and elegant". "The Times" was unimpressed, describing the piece as "romantic fustian". Many of the reviews thought the plot derivative of Coward's pre-war hit, "Private Lives". The acting of Fontanne and Lunt, however, was consistently praised, though "The Daily Express" called the production "a waste of expensive talent".
Lunt won a Tony Award for best actor in the 1955 Broadway production, which also starred Fontanne and featured Brian Aherne, Edna Best and Jerome Kilty. The Broadway run lasted for 159 performances and could have profitably run for longer, but the Lunts preferred to close in March 1955.
Plot.
The date is 1873. The wife (Spencer) of Diensen, a railway magnate (Lunt) has run off to the South of France with Lord Heronden (Jones). Diensen and Lady Heronden (Fontanne) join forces to find their errant partners and get them back. They succeed, but are not glad to have done so because they have fallen in love with each other. At the end of the play, they elope together.

<doc id="5949300" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5949300" title="Brand licensing">
Brand licensing

Licensing means renting or leasing of an intangible asset. It is a process of creating and managing contracts between the owner of a brand and a company or individual who wants to use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a trademark or character onto products of a completely different nature.
Examples of intangible assets include a song (“Somewhere Over The Rainbow”), a character (Donald Duck), a name (Michael Jordan), or a brand (The Ritz-Carlton). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor). 
History.
Brand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of patents and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. Mickey Mouse's popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.
This process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. McDonalds play food, Burger King t-shirts and even ghastly Good Humor Halloween costumes became commonplace. Brand extensions later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to "rent" the product of an established brand name. Armor All auto vacuums, Breyers yogurt, TGI Friday's frozen appetizers, and Lucite nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.
Reasons for licensing.
A company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for brand extensions or products. For example, when Apple launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a licensee make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded “Earbud Headphones”, “iPod docking stations” and “iPod socks.” Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licenses. 
Apart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their merchandise, but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps: 
Licensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. Royalties are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales. 
The global brand licensing industry.
The main international professional association for brand licensing is the Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association, which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo. 
Each May, "License! Global" magazine publishes an annual list of "The Top 150 Global Licensors." For 2013, the leader was Disney Consumer Products with $39.3 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by Iconix Brand Group and PVH. 
Brand licensing in India.
The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. Arvind Brands represent Wrangler, Arrow, Nautica, Jansport and Kipling. The Murjani Group is the licensee for FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail.
Character Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are Walt Disney, Viacom and Cartoon Network Enterprises. Characters licensed out by Walt Disney include Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Viacom has brought in popular characters from Nickelodeon like Dora The Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants.
Brand licensing in Italy.
Brand Licensing in Italy started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Mr. Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as He-Man and the Master of the Universe, Marvel Comics, Star Wars, Hanna & Barbera characters, Zorro, Asterix and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.

Willie Carson (photo-journalist)

Willie Carson (16 July 1926-6 Oct 1996) was a Northern Irish photo-journalist. He was born in Derry. His photographs were published throughout the world at the height of The Troubles; his discretion and integrity earned him the respect of both sides in the conflict. His funeral was attended by John Hume and Martin McGuinness, and Ian Paisley led tributes to him in the "Belfast Telegraph" following his death in 1996.
Carson was an author of several books about life in "Derry Derry Thru The Lens", "Yesterday...", "A Decade and a Half" and "So this was Derry". A definitive posthumous collection of his photographic work named after his first book of 1976 - "Derry Thru The Lens: Refocus" - was published in 2006 by the Guildhall Press.
Leaving the Longtower School aged 10, a love of still photographs followed Carson through his work as salesman for the local Derry Journal newspaper and then into marketing, until eventually with four children under the age of five years, he decided to follow his heart and became a freelance photographer, never dreaming of what was to present itself as his subject matter with the start of the conflict in the North of Ireland. From local photographer he, along with many others, was catapulted onto an international stage. Photographers from all over the world visited and stayed at his home, using his back yard dark room to process their films and his front room to dry their prints.
As he recorded the horrors of the so-called 'troubles' Carson also continued to capture the life of the city that continued beneath the surface of international headlines and the changes wrought by redevelopment to the streets around his beloved birthplace, the Brandywell. 
In the 1990s he began to think of another publication of his pictures bringing his work into the present day but died before he got the time to fully realise his ambition. Eventually in 2006, his son William, with the help of Willie's wife, Oonagh and siblings Oonagh, Catherine and Mary, and the expert guidance and support of The Guildhall Press, curated the definitive collection of his work.

"Who's That Girl?" is a 1983 song recorded by the British pop duo Eurythmics. It was written by bandmembers Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart and produced by Stewart. "Who's That Girl?" was the first single released in the UK from Eurythmics' third album "Touch".
The track is a heavily synthesized ballad in which Lennox takes the role of a suspicious woman demanding to know with whom her lover has been seen associating. The song became Eurythmics' third Top 10 single in the UK singles chart, peaking at number three. In the United States, "Who's That Girl?" was released as the second single from the album, following the Top 10 hit "Here Comes the Rain Again". It climbed to number twenty-one on the Billboard Hot 100.
Music video.
Stewart appears in the video, escorted by a long series of different women played by a variety of guest stars, Cheryl Baker and Jay Aston of Bucks Fizz, Kiki Dee, Hazel O'Connor, Kate Garner of Haysi Fantayzee and all four members of Bananarama (including Stewart's future wife, Siobhan Fahey and future group member Jacquie O'Sullivan, appearing as a lookalike for movie actress Meryl Streep. O'Sullivan would replace Fahey in Bananarama in 1988). The gender-bending pop star Marilyn also makes an appearance in the video, apparently posing as another of Stewart's conquests. Despite the small role, Marilyn's appearance proved a high-profile move which helped lead to his own music career later the same year. Uncredited lookalikes for movie actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren also make an appearance.

The Justiciar of Lothian (in Norman-Latin, "Justiciarus Laudonie") was an important legal office in the High Medieval Kingdom of Scotland.
The Justiciars of Lothian were responsible for the administration of royal justice in the province of Lothian, a much larger area than the modern Lothian, covering Scotland south of the Forth and Clyde, outwith Galloway, which had its own Justiciar of Galloway. The institution may date to the reign of King David I (died 1153), whose godson David Olifard was the first attested Justiciar. The Justiciars of Lothian, although not magnates of the stature of the typical Justiciar of Scotia, were significant landowners and not creatures of the kings.

South Sea Bubble (play)

South Sea Bubble is a play by the English actor and dramatist Noël Coward. It was written in 1949 but not performed until 1951, and not in its final form until 1956. The play was moderately successful in 1956 but failed to match the popularity of Coward's pre-war hits.
Background.
The play is named after the South Sea Bubble, an economic bubble that arose from speculation in the South Sea Company.
The play was originally written as a vehicle for Gertrude Lawrence, titled "Home and Colonial". Coward intended her to open in it after the conclusion of her run in "The King and I", but her unexpected death meant that she never played it. The play was retitled "Island Fling", which opened in 1951 with Claudette Colbert in the lead. It ran for eight performances in Westport, Connecticut, U.S.
The final version of the play opened as "South Sea Bubble", at the Lyric Theatre in the West End, on 25 April 1956. It was directed by William Chappell and starred Vivien Leigh as Sandy Shotter, the wife of the governor of Samolo, a British island colony in the South Seas. Leigh left the cast in August 1956 and was succeeded by Elizabeth Sellars. The play ran until Christmas 1956, a total of 276 performances.
Samolo, a British possession in the south Pacific, was invented by Coward for his post-war musical "Pacific 1860", and reused not only in "South Sea Bubble", but in the author's only novel, "Pomp and Circumstance" (1960) in which the Shotters reappear, and in the play "Volcano", written in 1956 but not staged until 2012.
Synopsis.
The governor of the south seas island of Samolo, Sir George Shotter, is a liberal-minded Englishman from a modest family background. He favours self-government for the island, but is opposed by an old-Etonian local grandee, Hali Alani. At Shotter's instigation, Lady Alexandra ("Sandy") uses her considerable personal charms to try to win Alani round to more progressive ideas. At Government House he responds warmly but decorously to her, but, irritated by spiteful insinuations from the wife of one of Shotter's colleagues, Sandy is provoked into visiting Hali later at his beach hut. He mistakes the nature of her overtures, and she finds it necessary to knock him out, hitting him on the head with a bottle of local spirit. The progress of events is observed with acid detachment by the novelist Boffin Kennedy. Scandal threatens to overtake Sandy, but with a combination of bluff and luck, and the gallantry of Hali, she survives with her reputation intact and island life continues much as before.
Critical reception.
The notices were mixed. "The Daily Express" judged the play Coward's best for ten years. "The Observer" found the conservative politics of the piece and its dialogue ("an anthology of Coward cliché") equally unpleasing. "The Times" thought the scene where Sandy knocks Hali out "not very much of a comedy". "The Manchester Guardian" found the same scene "one of the crispest and most eloquent moments that the English comedy stage has provided for years," but thought the author's touch uncertain elsewhere.

Spa Fields riots

The Spa Fields Riots was public disorder arising out of mass meetings at Spa Fields, Islington, England on 15 November and 2 December 1816. Revolutionary Spenceans, who opposed the British government, had planned to encourage rioting and then seize control of the government by taking the Tower of London and the Bank of England. Arthur Thistlewood and three other Spencean leaders were arrested and charged with high treason as a result of the riot; James Watson was on trial during June 1817 with Messrs Wetherell and Copley as their defence counsel. Watson was acquitted and the other three were released without trial. 
The first Spa Fields meeting, on 15 November 1816, attracted about 10,000 people and passed off peacefully in the main. Its official object was to seek popular support for the delivery of a petition to the Prince Regent, requesting electoral reform and relief from hardship and distress. Henry Hunt addressed the meeting and was elected to deliver the petition, along with Sir Francis Burdett, although the latter subsequently declined to go. The second meeting, on 2 December, was called after Hunt was refused access to the Regent to deliver the petition, and may have been attended by 20,000 people. Hunt spoke as planned, and most of the crowd listened to him, but some disorder broke out according to the Spenceans' agenda. A group of protesters moved away from the main crowd, accompanying James Watson and his son toward the Tower of London, looting a gun shop along the way. They were met by troops at the Royal Exchange and dispersed or were arrested. One man was stabbed during the disturbances, and a John Cashman was later found guilty of stealing weapons from the gun shop, and sentenced to death. The main witness to the 'plotting' was a government spy, John Castle, who had infiltrated the Spenceans. He may have been working as an agent provocateur, and his character and reliability were discredited at the trial of the first accused, James Watson. Watson was acquitted and the case against other the arrested men was dropped. 
Henry Hunt's role in the events is disputed. He claimed afterwards not to have known about an uprising and tried to distance himself from events.
The Spa Fields meetings were one of the first cases of mass meetings in public, and contributed to the government's conviction that revolution was possible and action must be taken. The Gagging Acts were passed in February and March 1817, and the Blanketeers march followed in the same month.

Peter Ackerman

Peter Ackerman (born November 6, 1946) is a businessman, the founder and chairman of Americans Elect, and is founding chair of the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. Ackerman is currently the managing director of Rockport Capital, Inc. 
Early life.
Peter Ackerman was born in New York City, New York. He received his undergraduate degree in political science from Colgate University. After graduating from Colgate, he attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University where he earned a Ph.D. in 1976 in International Relations. While at Tufts, he studied under Gene Sharp and Robert Pfaltzgraff. Ackerman's thesis, "Strategic Aspects of Nonviolent Resistance Movements", examined the nonviolent strategy and tactics used by people who are living under oppression and have no viable military option to free themselves.
Dispute resolution career.
In 1983 Ackerman co-founded the Albert Einstein Institute, which according to "Bloomberg News", "advises pro-democracy activists on how to topple dictators via protests and mock elections". In 1989 Ackerman consulted with student protestors from China following the Tiananmen Square incident. In 1990 he moved to London where he was a visiting scholar at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. During this time he co-authored the book "Strategic Nonviolent Conflict: The Dynamics of People Power in the Twentieth Century" with Christopher Kruegler. 
Ackerman was also a series editor and principal content advisor in the television version of Steve York's 1999 Emmy-nominated film "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict", which charts the history of civilian-based resistance in the 20th Century, and co-authored with Jack DuVall a book of the same title. In 2002, Ackerman was the Executive Producer of the PBS-TV documentary "Bringing Down A Dictator", the sequel to "A Force More Powerful", which chronicled the fall of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic by nonviolent means. The documentary received a 2003 Peabody Award and was the recipient of the 2002 ABC News VideoSource Award of the International Documentary Association. Eli J. Lake stated that Ackerman's book was in fact one of the blueprints used by the Optor movement that overthrew Miloslevic. 
According to "Bloomberg", "In 2005, he co-wrote a study showing that non-violent action had been instrumental in 50 of 67 transitions to democracy since 1972, including in Chile, the Philippines and Poland. He has funded workshops for dissidents from Central Asia, Iran, Iraq and North Korea ... Ackerman also funded the Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, which was started in 2003 by student leaders who’d helped bring down Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic three years earlier. Some members of Egypt’s April 6 movement, which toppled President Hosni Mubarak, took civil resistance training from Canvas organizers in Belgrade." In 2005 Ackerman became a director of the Institute for Strategic Studies' IISS-US office. Ackerman was also a founding chair of the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict.
Business career.
In 1973, Ackerman joined the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. From 1978 to 1990, Ackerman was Director of International Capital Markets Drexel until the company filed for bankruptcy. While at Drexel, Ackerman made more than $300 million working alongside 'Junk Bond King' Michael Milken, raising billions of dollars for junk-bond-fueled takeovers. This included the second highest take-home salary in Wall Street history as of 1988, the year he received $165 million. Criminal charges were never brought against Ackerman in Drexel's insider trading scandal, and Ackerman publicly denounced the treatment of Milken and other leaders at Drexel by the firm once the government began to investigate them. Ackerman subsequently paid a $73 million settlement in a civil case brought against him by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation. 
After leaving Drexel, Ackerman founded several other companies including Safari Acquisition. One of Safari's attempted acquisitions was its 1996 bid for control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. His main investment firms include Rockport Capital Inc. and Crown Capital. In 2002 Ackerman co-founded the online grocery service FreshDirect.
Ackerman is currently a member of the Board of the Council on Foreign Relations, is the Chair Emeritus of the Board of Advisors of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, his alma mater and is the former chair of the board of trustees of Freedom House, a position in which he served from September 2005 until January 2009.
Political involvement.
In 2008, Ackerman sat on the board for Unity08, an organization looking to fund third-party candidates. In October, 2012 Ackerman, along with New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Passport Capital founder John Burbank, funded the purchase of $1.75 million in independent political advertising, in the name of Ackerman's tax-exempt Americans Elect organization, supporting the Senate campaign of Maine governor Angus King. Ackerman contributed the initial $5 million seed money to Americans Elect, a 2012 third-party Presidential nomination initiative, and serves as Chairman of its Board of Directors. Ackerman's son, Elliot, serves as Chief Operating Officer of Americans Elect. On May 17, 2012 Americans Elect, unable to mount a successful primary ballot, announced that "The primary process for the Americans Elect nomination has come to an end."
Courtroom issues.
In 2003 Ackerman sued the California Franchise Tax Board to recover $5 million in taxes previously paid. He lost the case on appeal. In 2005 a bill was introduced in the California legislature, which was noted by a Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee analysis to appear to solely benefit Ackerman at a potential cost of $5 million to the state. That year the United States Tax Court ruled that Ackerman was involved in an illegal $1.7 billion tax shelter and the IRS determined that Ackerman owed $150 million in taxes, a case resolved in June 2011 in an undisclosed settlement. Another tax court ruling in 2009 found that he owed an additional $2.6 million.

Charles Butterworth (actor)

Charles Butterworth (July 26, 1896 – June 14, 1946) was an American actor specializing in comedy roles, often in musicals. In his obituary, he was described as "the man who could not make up his mind". Butterworth's distinct voice was the inspiration for the Cap'n Crunch commercials from the Jay Ward studio. Voice actor Daws Butler based Cap'n Crunch on the voice of Butterworth.
Career.
He once worked on a newspaper but was fired and then rehired when it was found out that he was courting the daughter of a big local advertiser. He also worked in the legal profession before going on stage and becoming a comedian in vaudeville in 1924.
One of Butterworth's more memorable film roles was in the Irving Berlin musical "This is the Army" (1943) as the bugle-playing Private Eddie Dibble. He generally was a supporting actor, e.g., to Mae West in "Every Day's a Holiday"; to the Andrews Sisters in "What's Cookin'?", "Give out, Sisters", and "Always a Bridesmaid"; to Jeanette MacDonald in "The Cat and the Fiddle" and "Love Me Tonight"; to Myrna Loy in "Penthouse"; to Lew Ayres in "My Weakness"; to Laurel and Hardy and Jimmy Durante in "Hollywood Party"; to Clark Gable, Robert Montgomery, and Joan Crawford in "Forsaking All Others"; to Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor in "Magnificent Obsession"; to Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray in "Swing High, Swing Low"; to Bob Hope in "Thanks for the Memory"; and to Fred Astaire, Paulette Goddard, and Burgess Meredith in "Second Chorus". However, he had top billing in "We Went to College" (1936), played the title role in "Baby Face Harrington" (1935), and shared top billing (as the Sultan) with Ann Corio in "The Sultan's Daughter" (1944).
He is credited with the quip "Why don't you slip out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini?" from "Every Day's a Holiday". In "Forsaking All Others", when Clark Gable, quoting Benjamin Franklin, said, "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise," Butterworth replied, "Ever take a good look at a milkman?"
Death.
Butterworth was killed in an automobile accident on June 13, 1946, when he lost control of his car on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and crashed. For his contribution to the motion picture industry he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7030 Hollywood Blvd.

Water eductor

A water eductor or water dredge is an eductor-jet pump-based tool used by underwater archaeologists to remove sediments from an underwater archaeological site. Airlifts may be used for the same purpose.
It consists of a large bore straight tube to which is attached a hose pipe through which clean water is pumped. The Bernoulli effect from the flow of pumped water causes suction at the mouth of the dredge. Water and sediment is sucked from the excavation site and released from the far end of the tube. The tube can be made of any rigid material such as steel or plastic. The diameter of the tube depends on the power available from the pump and whether delicate work is required. 
In the hands of a trained archaeologist, the water dredge performs the same function as a wheelbarrow on land. It is used to carry away sediments, not to dig holes. The archaeologist dislodges the material using a trowel, brush or by making a fanning motion with the hand to cause a current to dislodge sediment. The archaeologist can also place overburden material directly into the mouth of the dredge. As the water dredge will remove particles held in suspension in the water, provided it is used correctly it will improve visibility in the immediate area of the excavation. Careful use of the water dredge ensures that artifacts can be recorded in context and features and stratigraphy can be studied. 
Using a water dredge or airlift, the underwater archaeologist has an advantage over terrestrial counterparts, as the spoil is removed without effort and without needing to be transported across other parts of the archaeological site. 
Where there is a possibility of small artifacts being missed because of poor visibility, a trap may be used at the outlet so that the lifted sediment can be filtered. 
Water eductors are also used by marine treasure hunters to suck sediments for filtering for buried artifacts. Using the water dredge to directly suck sediments means that archaeological information on context and stratigraphy is not recorded.
An Eductor can also form part of a wet scrubber system which are designed to remove soluble gases and particulate by inducing a gas flow using high pressure liquid focused into a venturi throat. Additionally, Eductor scrubbers can be used for direct-contact condensation

<doc id="5949359" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5949359" title="Remix service">
Remix service

A remix service is a service (company or organization) that provides remixed music to disc jockeys.
History.
In the United States, the disco craze of the late 1970s led to the release of extended "disco" versions of songs, most of which were released on 12" vinyl singles. Many of these were not easily beatmixed, so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by splicing reel-to-reel tape copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor. 
1977 saw the creation of the first remix service, Disconet. These companies gathered DJs and producers together to create monthly, promotional-only compilation albums containing re-edits, remixes, or medleys that were geared specifically toward club DJs.
By 1994, there was a saturation of remix services, most of which typically remixed the same tracks as their competitor. At that point, the RIAA got involved and began notifying remix services that they needed to have clear permission from publishers or face litigation. Coincidentally, the services that survived the fallout (Ultimix, X-mix, Hot Tracks) all featured remixers that currently had radio mix-shows. In exchange for allowing remixing of certain tracks, remixers could be counted on by the labels to help "break" the new song they were trying to promote by featuring the track heavily in their mix-show. 
While some services decided to ultimately close shop, others such as Wicked Mix, went underground and continued to release remix issues that featured no information on who the mixers were or any contact information. Similarly, a proliferation of "white label" mixes began to pop up at most DJ record shops. It should be noted that an effort was made by one of the larger services to clear a way for all services to become legal. The idea was for every service to pay either a flat fee or a percentage of sales to a commission who would then allocate the money to the publishers whose tracks were used. This idea was rebuffed by the labels.
Modern mixes.
Over the years, the remixes featured on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a mixable intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged digital multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services have focused on a specific style of music (such as hip-hop or rock) or type of remix (such as house mixes of pop hits). 
As of 2006, there have been over 50 official remix services worldwide with at least as many spinoffs, although most of these companies (including Disconet) have long since folded due to financial or legal reasons. All remix services are required to get the original record label or artists' permission to edit and release a track, but many bootleg services exist that do not.
Distribution.
Most of these companies required a DJ subscription agreement to buy the records or CDs, and each issue was typically limited in quantity from 100 to several thousand. Many of these compilations have become sought after collectors items as a result. Once in a while a remix service version of a song is released commercially by the artist's record label, but 99% of remix service mixes are sold only to DJs on the compilations.
Notable companies.
Some of these companies helped launch the careers of many well-known remixers/producers.
Chris Cox (formerly of Thunderpuss) worked for Hot Tracks (now Select Mix). Armand Van Helden created mixes for Mega-Mixx and X-Mix. Markus Schulz, C. L. McSpadden and Aaron "The Pimp" Scofield made mixes for Powerhouse - after the company folded Scofield and McSpadden offered remixes through Culture Shock, while Schulz releases remixes and original compositions through his own Coldharbour Recordings label. Ben Liebrand released numerous remixes with DMC. A few companies/artists besides Schulz have also developed their own commercial record labels to release new tracks.
The UK-based DMC remix service probably has the most members in the world, with offices in nearly every country, and that they sponsor the yearly World DJ Championships as well as releasing many commercial compilations.
Some of the better known remix services (all US-based unless stated):
Megamixes.
Many remix services issues also contain megamixes. A megamix contains multiple songs mixed together, sometimes in rapid succession. They can consist of a single artist (just Madonna songs, etc.) or multiple artists. Some may follow a theme as well (Christmas, only songs that have "queen" in the title, only David Morales mixes, etc.). Often megamixes are also called medleys. 
Megamixes are also commonly found on commercial releases, sometimes using the same mix previously released to DJs on a remix service. The earlier Jive Bunny & The Mastermixers series of 50s and 60s megamixes were originally released on the Music Factory Mastermix service.
Among modern services, Ultimix is well known for producing several megamixes every year based on popular songs of the year ("flashback medleys") as well as some single artist megamixes. Culture Shock has the "Hit "AC" Megamixes" on their main series derived from their now defunct radio show, as well as a satellite series entitled "Use Alternative Routes" which contains Modern Rock megamixes. Similarly, the UK-based DMC and Music Factory Mastermix remix services frequently include megamixes on their issues.

Wild Cat (Hersheypark)

The Wild Cat (initially The Joy Ride) was the name of a wooden roller coaster located in Hersheypark, Hershey, Pennsylvania. Milton S. Hershey had the ride built at a cost of $50,000, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the town of Hershey. It was the first roller coaster built in Hersheypark. However, unlike all other roller coasters build at the park since, Wild Cat was owned by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) and the land the ride was built on was leased to PTC on an agreement that expired in 1945. 
Wild Cat was Herbert Schmeck's first roller coaster design. When the ride opened on June 16, 1923, it was called The Joy Ride, but it was shortly after renamed Wildcat. The ride stood approximately where the Trailblazer and Storm Runner's double roll and snake dive are currently, and the ride went through a tunnel near the present-day Country Grill. The first woman to ride the roller coaster is Miss Marion Murrie, the daughter of Hershey baseball coach and Hershey Chocolate factory worker William Murrie. 
The roller coaster operated through the 1945 season. It had been decided that Wild Cat would be torn down and replaced with a new wooden roller coaster. It had fallen in to significant disrepair as a result of the Second World War economy requiring most wood and supplies to go to the United States' war effort. Schmeck designed the replacement roller coaster, Comet, which was Milton Hershey's last purchased ride (he died before Comet's completion), and is still in operation as of the 2012 Hersheypark season. 
In 1995, Hersheypark announced they were building a new wooden roller coaster for the 1996 season. They chose the name "Wildcat" in honor of the Wild Cat, and used the slogan, "The Cat is back!"

O'Brien Institute

The O'Brien Institute is a building complex in Dublin, Ireland. It was built 1880–1883. The purpose of the building was to serve as an orphan home and school, financed by a trust that was founded by Bridget O'Brien in 1876.The last of the boarders (four in all) left in 1976,when the school was closed for good,at the time it was run by the Christian Brothers. The architect was John Joseph O'Callaghan (+ 1905). The original buildings of the Institution are listed buildings, number 4940 in the Dublin City Development Plan 2005-2011. Today the buildings are used as Training centre for the Dublin Fire Brigade.
Building phase.
The Building was commenced in 1880. The contractors were Messrs. Hammond and Co., based in Dublin and Drogheda, J.J. O'Callaghan carried out the superintendence himself. 
Three years later, in August 1883 the works were nearly finished. The Irish builder described the chapel like this: “The chapel consists of chancel, choir, seculars’ chapel, sacristy, and belfry. A large organ gallery is situated at the west end in fact it is the south-east – end, and is approached by circular stairs, making a bold feature in connection with the west gable. The chapel is connected with the main building by a cloister corridor about 30 ft in length. The belfry is situated at the north-west end [in fact south-west, and forms a porch to secular chapel, and is surmounted by an octagon spire, which, like the rest of the building, is built in brick. The dressings generally are in Drogheda limestone, while the walls throughout are built of brick from Kingscourt, Co. Cavan. The roof is open timbered to the curved ribs, and is paneled; the windows are glazed in lead lights. The woodwork is painted two shades, plain colour.” 
The Dublin newspapers wrote: “[..] The chapel, detached from the main building by a corridor, adds much to the general architectural effect. [..] The chapel has an apsidal end nave, and contains a handsomely-designed organ gallery and Communion rails, seats of pitch pine, and an extremely effective Portland stone altar. The large wheel window in the east gable adding much to the appearance of the elevation. A belfry of brick, with stone dressing, completes the design of the S.E. angle.” 
Next to the Institute is the Casino at Marino.

Statements in response to the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings came from heads of state, political leaders, and militant leaders from around the world. Most offered some sort of condemnation of the attacks and commented on terrorism as a whole.
Indian statements.
Various senior political figures condemned the attacks, including President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, and president of the Indian National Congress Sonia Gandhi. L. K. Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, also expressed shock, while saying that the UPA Government was soft on terrorists. The Party Chief of the BJP, Rajnath Singh also condemned the attacks saying, while targeting the government, that "Had POTA not been repealed by the UPA government, the terror groups would not have got encouraged,"
The Left Parties also condemned the attacks, calling for a thorough probe into the incident.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to call for calm in Mumbai. In a televised address, he said: Singh has received praise for his measured response.
Statements from militant groups.
The Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militant groups have condemned the blasts and rejected suggestions that they are behind the attacks. A spokesman for the Lashkar-e-Toiba group described the bombings as "inhuman" and "barbaric". It should, however be noted that these groups have reduced direct attacks on the establishment of late and have started providing intelligence and arms to splinter groups and sympathetic organisations like SIMI to carry out similar deadly attacks. 
A spokesman of Al Qaeda told CNS that the Al Qaeda Jammu and Kashmir chief Abu Abdur Rahman Ansari has "expressed happiness over the Mumbai serial blasts and appreciated those who carried out these attacks." He further stated that Al Qaeda had established itself in Jammu and Kashmir.

He is perhaps best known for standing up to Senator Joseph McCarthy during a televised 1953 Senate committee hearing in which Mandel pointedly told the senator, "This is a book-burning! You lack only the tinder to set fire to the books as Hitler did twenty years ago, and I am going to get that across to the American people!"
In 1960, Mandel was again subpoenaed, this time by the House Un-American Activities Committee. He testified on May 13 in a hearing held at the San Francisco City Hall. Outside the hearing, hundreds of protesting Bay Area college students were blasted with firehoses and dragged down the marble steps by police officers, leaving some seriously injured. Newsreel cameras recorded Mandel's scathing response to the question posed by Lead Counsel Richard Arens, "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?":
Honorable beaters of children, sadists, uniformed and in plain clothes, distinguished Dixiecrat wearing the clothing of a gentleman, eminent Republican who opposes an accommodation with the one country with which we must live at peace in order for us and all our children to survive. My boy of fifteen left this room a few minutes ago in sound health and not jailed, solely because I asked him to be in here to learn something about the procedures of the United States government and one of its committees. Had he been outside where a son of a friend of mine had his head split by these goons operating under your orders, my boy today might have paid the penalty of permanent injury or a police record for desiring to come here and hear how this committee operates. If you think that I am going to cooperate with this collection of Judases, of men who sit there in violation of the United States Constitution, if you think I will cooperate with you in any way, you are insane!"
Mandel "spent the remainder of his testimony respectfully telling his inquisitors to go to hell." William F. Buckley later characterized Mandel's testimony as "a histrionic speech."
Recordings of the hearing were aired repeatedly on KPFA and other Pacifica Radio stations in subsequent years, and "literally represented the final hours of the 1950s" for young people who had come of age in the McCarthy era. Scenes from the hearings and protest were later featured in the award-winning 1990 documentary, "Berkeley in the Sixties".
Broadcaster and activist.
Mandel began his career as a broadcaster in 1958, with an hour-long weekly program on Pacifica Radio station KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California. Originally called "Soviet Press and Periodicals", the program stayed on the air under various names until 1995, when it was abruptly cancelled due to internal conflicts at the station. Mandel appears in the documentary film "KPFA On the Air" (Independent Television Service, 2000). Subsequently, Mandel hosted a weekly show on Free Radio Berkeley. 
In his book, "In Battle for Peace," the noted Black American scholar and activist Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois referred to William Mandel's "defense" of him when Du Bois was "under federal indictment for heading the circulation of a peace petition".
Mandel supported the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, California, in the early 1960s. He continues to write and do limited radio broadcasts.
In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.
Writings.
The introduction to Mandel's autobiography, "Saying No To Power," was written by the left wing historian and author Howard Zinn. The book received critical acclaim from notables, including author and senior editor of "The Black Scholar," Robert L. Allen; renowned musician and activist Pete Seeger; and the internationally respected poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
The Hoover Institution Archives, Wisconsin Historical Society and the Bancroft Library at the University of California have collections of Mandel's papers.

Apizaco

Apizaco is a city in Apizaco Municipality located near the geographic center of the Mexican state of Tlaxcala, approximately 25 minutes by car from the state's capital city of Tlaxcala. The city gets its name from the Nahuatl language words "ātl" (water), "pitzāhuac" (thin), and the suffix "co" (place), forming "Āpitzāco", or roughly "thin water place". Those seeking to reach the port of Veracruz by railroad from Mexico City must travel through Apizaco. The city began because of its location on this railroad.
Universities in Apizaco include the Technological Institute of Apizaco ("Instituto Tecnológico de Apizaco"), and most recently, the University of the Valley of Tlaxcala ("Universidad del Valle de Tlaxcala")
The city's climate is temperate and arid. Temperature in the winter can fall below 0°C, and in the summer, it can reach in excess of 30°C.
The city is the second in importance after the capital city, Tlaxcala. It is of major commercial and trade value to the state because it is halfway on the road between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz.
The census of 2005 reported a population of 49,459 in the city of Apizaco, while the municipality had 73,097 inhabitants. The city is the second largest in the state in population, behind only Villa Vicente Guerrero. The municipality has an area of 56.83 km² (21.94 sq mi) and includes a small number of other communities, the largest of which are Santa Anita Huiloac, Santa María Texcalac, and San Luis Apizaquito.
Transportation.
Apizaco is close to Mexico City's proposed plan to make a new larger international airport near Apizaco to lessen the congested airspace.

Neukloster

Neukloster is a town in the east of the district of Nordwestmecklenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. This town is the administrative center of the bureau Neukloster-Warin, which includes eight more communes.
Geography.
Neukloster is located at the Neuklostersee (Lake Neukloster), which originates from the Ice Age. The area around Neukloster belongs to the outmost north-western part of the Sternberger Seenlandschaft (Seascape of Sternberg). Neukloster is approx. away from Rostock and approx. away from Wismar.
The villages Lübberstorf, Glasin, Zurow, Benz and Züsow border on Neukloster.
History.
The history of Neukloster goes back to the Middle Ages, like most of the other places around.
In 1170 the Kussinger Burg (Kussinger Castle) already existed in today's city limits of Neukloster.
It is supposed that the center of the castle was located in the center of today's city center.
In the Middle Ages the Kloster Sonnenkamp (Sonnenkamp Convent) was located in the smaller village of Parchow. During this period, that area was hard-fought and it was exposed to the violence of the Middle Ages.
The convent was relocated to Neukloster. This convent in Neukloster was first mentioned in 1219. The castle tumbled down with time, nevertheless the convent developed into a cultural and commercial center for this region.
The convent was closed in the year of 1555. Its wealth and real estate went to the property of the Lords of Mecklenburg.
After Thirty Years' War, in 1648, Neukloster, Wismar and some closer places, fell under the lordship of Sweden.
During this period of time, Neukloster was confronted with impecuniousness and balefulness, but after all, Neukloster endured this time until 1803. In that year, the Swedish occupation decided to lease Neukloster (and all other areas in Mecklenburg) to Mecklenburg-Schwerin for 100 years. After these 100 years, Neukloster and all other leased areas around, were annexed to Mecklenburg.
Neukloster became more important for the region, when the "Lehrerseminar" (seminar for teachers) moved from Ludwigslust to that small town, in 1862. Two years later, the "Landesblindenanstalt" (state's home for the blind) was founded in Neukloster. The population increased quickly, trade and industry were booming. In 1887, Neukloster was linked to the local railroad network.
In 1938, Neukloster received its town charter; the population doubled in the years after World War II, from 2,500 to almost 5,000 inhabitants.
During the German Democratic Republic, 1949–1990, the landscape of Neukloster changed dramatically. Neukloster got a small town appearance. Many buildings were built, i.e. a campground, a movie theater, an old people's home, a stadium, schools, a kindergarten, the building of the Catholic Church and the market place.
Within the "Städebauförderung" (urban development sponsorship), Neukloster has been renovated since 1991.
Transport connection.
Neukloster is connected with the Bundesautobahn 20 (interstate #20). The Bundesstraße 192 (highway #192) (Wismar–Neubrandenburg) is only away from Neukloster. The railroad station is closed. To go farer distances, it is recommended to take the railroad station in Bad Kleinen or Rostock.

<doc id="5949450" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5949450" title="Greek Constitution of 1864">
Greek Constitution of 1864

The Second National Assembly of the Hellenes took place in Athens (1863 - 1864) and dealt both with the election of a new sovereign as well as with the drafting of a new Constitution, thereby implementing the transition from constitutional monarchy to a Crowned Democracy.
Following the refusal of Prince Alfred of Great Britain (who was elected by an overwhelming majority in the first referendum of the country in November 1862) to accept the crown of the Greek kingdom, the government offered the crown to the Danish prince George Christian Willem of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg, who was crowned constitutional King of Greece under the name "George I, King of the Hellenes".
The Constitution of 1864 was drafted following the models of the Constitutions of Belgium of 1831 and of Denmark of 1849, and established in clear terms the principle of popular sovereignty, since the only legislative body with reversionary powers was now the Parliament. Furthermore, article 31 reiterated that all the powers stemmed from the Nation and were to be exercised as provided by the Constitution, while article 44 established the principle of accountability, taking into consideration that the King only possessed the powers that were bestowed on him by the Constitution and by the laws applying the same.
The Assembly chose the system of a single chamber Parliament (Vouli) with a four-year term, and hence abolished the Senate, which many accused for being a tool in the hands of the monarchy. Direct, secret and universal elections was adopted as the manner to elect the MPs, while elections were to be held simultaneously throughout the entire nation.
In addition, article 71 introduced a conflict between being an MP and a salaried public employee or mayor at the same time, but not with serving as an army officer.
The Constitution reiterated various clauses found in the Constitution of 1844, such as that the King appoints and dismisses the ministers and that the latter are responsible for the person of the monarch, but it also allowed for the Parliament to establish "examination committees". Moreover, the King preserved the right to convoke the Parliament in ordinary as well as in extraordinary sessions, and to dissolve it at his discretion, provided, however, that the dissolution decree was also countersigned by the Cabinet.
The Constitution repeated verbatim the clause of article 24 of the Constitution of 1844, according to which "The King appoints and removes his Ministers". This phrase insinuated that the ministers were practically subordinate to the monarch, and thereby answered not only to the Parliament but to him as well. Moreover, nowhere was it stated in the Constitution that the King was obliged to appoint the Cabinet in conformity with the will of the majority in Parliament. This was, however, the interpretation that the modernizing political forces of the land upheld, invoking the principle of popular sovereignty and the spirit of the Parliamentary regime. They finally succeeded in imposing it through the principle of "manifest confidence" of the Parliament, which was expressed in 1875 by Charilaos Trikoupis and which, that same year, in his Crown Speech, King George I expressly pledged to uphold: "I demand as a prerequisite, of all that I call beside me to assist me in governing the country, to possess the manifest confidence and trust of the majority of the Nation's representatives. Furthermore, I accept this approval to stem from the Parliament, as without it the harmonious functioning of the polity would be impossible".
The establishment of the principle of "manifest confidence" towards the end of the first decade of the crowned democracy, contributed towards the disappearance of a constitutional practice which, in many ways, reiterated the negative experiences of the period of the reign of King Otto. Indeed, from 1864 through 1875 numerous elections of dubious validity had taken place, while, additionally and most importantly, there was an active involvement of the Throne in political affairs through the appointment of governments enjoying a minority in Parliament, or through the forced resignation of majority governments, when their political views clashed with those of the crown.

Isamu Chō

Biography.
Chō was a native of Fukuoka prefecture. He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1916 and from the Army Staff College in 1928.
After he received his commission, Chō was assigned to his first duty outside Japan with the politicized Kwantung Army based in eastern China. He returned to play a very active role in internal politics within the Japanese army, and was an active or indirect participant in the March Incident and the Imperial Colors Incident (with other leaders: Kingoro Hashimoto, Jirō Minami, Sadao Araki for the military, and nationalists Ikki Kita, Shūmei Ōkawa, Kanichiro Kamei, Kozaburo Tachibana and Mitsuru Toyama). He was a founder of the radical "Sakura Kai" secret society, whose aim was to overthrow the democratic government in favor of a state socialist regime which would stamp out corruption.
At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chō was commander of the IJA 74th Infantry Regiment of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force, attached to Japanese Central China Area Army, and based in Manchukuo. At the Battle of Nanjing, he was aide-de-camp to Prince Asaka and is thought to have been complicit in ordering the massacre of prisoners of war, but it is disputed whether he obeyed an order from the prince, or whether he acted on his own.
Chō was subsequently involved in a number of border incidents between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union as Chief of Staff of the IJA 26th Division from 1939 to 1940. In 1940, he was transferred briefly to the Taiwan Army of Japan Headquarters, and then became Chief of Staff of the Indochina Expeditionary Army from 1940 to 1941.
Chō was Vice Chief of Staff of Unit 82 within the Military Affairs Bureau, in the Ministry of War in 1941, and participated in the strategic and tactical planning for the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia. From 1941 to 1942, he accompanied the Southern Army to French Indochina to oversee implementation of Japanese strategy, and served as a liaison officer between the Southern Army and the 14th Army in the Philippines.
From 1942 until 1944, Chō was commander of the IJA 10th Division, a garrison force based in Manchukuo. Promoted to lieutenant general in 1944, he served in the Kwangtung Army Headquarters, and later as commander of the 1st Mobile Brigade. 
In 1945, Chō was Chief of Staff of the 32nd Army during the Battle of Okinawa and masterminded the elaborate underground fortifications around Shuri Castle, but favored a highly aggressive response to the American invasion rather than a passive defense. He persuaded General Mitsuru Ushijima to launch the disastrous 5 May 1945 counteroffensive. He committed seppuku alongside Ushijima on 22 June 1945 rather than surrender to the American forces.
Cho was regarded as an quick tempered, offensive, zealous officer who was known to strike subordinates when angry or frustrated.

Theodore Rshtuni

Theodore Rshtuni (, also spelled Theodoros Ṛštuni; 590 - 654/655 AD), equated with the "patrikios" Pasagnathes (Πασαγνάθης) of Theophanes the Confessor, was an Armenian "nakharar", famous for resisting the first Arab invasions of Armenia. Rshtuni was appointed as "ishkhan" and "kouropalates" of Byzantine Armenia by Emperor Heraclius when the previous "ishkan" David Saharuni was overthrown by other "nakharars."
Arab invasions.
Prior to the Arab invasions, Rshtuni had been appointed the "sparapet" (commander-in-chief) of the Armenian forces in the Armenian Marzapante and was appointed as the "marzban" of Armenia in 634. He defended, alongside the Byzantine General Procopius, against the first, unsuccessful, Arab attack into Armenia in 640. He was unable to prevent the Arabs from pillaging the capital of Dvin in 642. He gained a victory over the Arabs, for which he was recognized as ruler of Armenia by Constans II in 643. 
Constans paid special attention to his family's imperiled homeland of Armenia, and he favored Byzantine generals of Armenian extraction to halt Arab advances. Meanwhile, the strength of Arab assaults continued to increase. Theodore eventually concluded a truce with then governor of Syria, Muawiyah I in 651, and Arabs concentrated their efforts against the remaining pockets of resistance in the Sassanid Empire. Finally, by 652 Rshtuni, despairing of further resistance, accepted Muawiyah's suzerainty and was appointed ruler of Armenia. Rshtuni was able to negotiate a treaty that left Armenia with a relatively high level of autonomy. 
In response, Constans personally marshaled his forces and led them to Armenia despite a growing plot against him in Constantinople, ironically by the Armenian commander of the Army of Thrace. Constans secured Armenia and deposed Theodoros, who took refuge on the island of Akhtamar. A Byzantine commander named Maurianus was given the task to defend the Armenian frontier. In 654 Maurianus was driven out of Armenia into the Caucasus and Theodoros was restored. Deciding that Theodoros was untrustworthy, the Arabs sent him to Damascus, where he died in captivity the following year. He was replaced as prince by his son-in-law, Hamazasp Mamikonian. His body was brought to his home district of Rshtunik', where he was buried in the tomb of his forefathers.
Legacy.
According to Manuk Abeghian and a number of other scholars, the popularity of Rshtuni in Armenia manifested itself in the character of K'eṛi T'oros in the epic poem of "David of Sasun". The Armenian writer Tserents also wrote a historical novel called "Theodoros Rshtuni".

Western Provident Association

WPA, or Western Provident Association, is a not-for-profit private medical insurance firm based in Taunton, Somerset. Its subsidiary, WPA Protocol Plc, administers corporate healthcare trusts.
History.
In 1901, a group of workers founded the Reading Work People's Voluntary Hospital Contributory Fund to cover the costs of health care for their members. In 1939, it merged with the Bristol Hospital Fund, and in 1949 it was renamed the Western Provident Association (WPA). In 1992, WPA moved from Bristol to a specially designed building in Taunton, Somerset.
Coinsurance.
WPA was described by the World Health Organization as leading in the development of coinsurance, or "shared responsibility", policies, in which the patient pays a portion of the liability until an agreed limit.
WPA vs. Norwich Union Healthcare.
In 1997, Norwich Union staff falsely claimed over e-mail that WPA was insolvent. WPA sued for defamation. Norwich Union made a High Court apology and paid £450,000 in damages and costs to settle the case. This was a landmark case because it was the first time e-mail was admitted as evidence in a British court.
Cancer Drugs and NHS Top-Up.
In 2007, WPA launched a new insurance plan which provided a health "top-up", supplementing NHS treatment. The first policy, called mycancerdrugs, was the first of its kind in the world and funded cancer drugs licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency but not available on the NHS, including Avastin. 
Subsequently, other insurance companies have entered the top-up market and criticism has been levelled at the products from the union Unison which stated that the products would undermine the values of the NHS and risk creating a two-tier system in health care.
WPA Protocol Plc.
WPA Protocol administers corporate healthcare trusts. This is an alternative arrangement to private medical insurance whereby larger companies, defined by Protocol as usually those with 400 or more members, can use WPA's infrastructure to administer their own healthcare provision. Companies provide the funds from a trust, and WPA Protocol provides bespoke literature and telephone lines, as well as staff, infrastructure and economies of scale. 
Trusts are not charged insurance premium tax and staff are considered to be more likely to claim responsibly from their own company as opposed to an insurer. Savings are estimated to be 7% compared to being fully insured.
WPA Franchise.
WPA has a well established and British Franchise Association (BFA) approved UK franchise operation where local WPA franchisees advise on WPA health insurance products and provide on-going customer support. The franchisees are remunerated for retention as well as the growth of their business reflecting WPA’s focus on treating customers fairly. Franchisees must complete a training course, as well as ongoing training, and submit a Fidelity Bond, to ensure that customers are treated fairly, although no franchisee has foregone a fidelity bond.

Situated on a rock which is from the northeast side tilted towards the Danube River. It is assumed that the city was built on a opposite side of fortress of Haram, from which nothing was left today, and which is located on the other side of the Danube. The remains of the city are in good condition today.
History.
The place first finds its reference in Trajanic times as a settlement where the cavalry units were stationed. The earliest record of Ram Fortress dates back to 1128 CE, as the year when where the Byzantines army defeated the Hungarians. After victories in this region, Byzantine army have focused their activities on the Pannonian Basin. In order to protect the right bank of the Danube Ottoman sultan Bayezid II (1480-1512) was revised and strengthened the existing fortress for fighting firearms. Ram Fortress represents one of the oldest artillery fort in Serbia.
The interior of the fortress was demolished during the Koca rebellion in 1788, and a caravanserai, which is built in the same way as the fortress, is found in its vicinity.
Appearance and characteristics.
Is not known when the city was built, but it certainly is one of the oldest forts in this region. Sultan Bayazid II (1480–1512) built the present fortifications of Ram Fortress, in the form of a regular pentagon maximum length of 34m and width of 26m, designed to withstand cannon warfare. The city consists of 5 towers at four levels (three floors and the ground floor), three on the east and two on the western rampart. Apart from the place, where the fortress is entered, there are four corner towers. The side towards and fort are surrounded by a low wall and wide dry moat in front of it. City entrance is at Donjon tower, which is located in the southwestern side of the fort.Masonry fireplace – rare in the medieval buildings of this region – are preserved in them. Over city's moat lies a bridge which is located at the southeastern tower, and that leads to a space between the fortress and the low walls around it. On all the ramparts except the West one, are located at the same distance from the tower, openings for guns.
Ram today.
Ram Fortress is today in very good condition. The towers are in good state, except for the Southeast, whose front part is almost completely destroyed. Ramparts of the fortress are also in good condition, while the small bulwark is present in trace amounts. Inside of the fort, along the western rampart lies remains a building, with a base of proper octagon, with sides length of 3m. Not far from the fortress the Turks were built a Caravanserai, around which was created present settlement Ram. The whole area around the fortress was archaeologically examined during the 1980s. During the 2013th the plan was enacted, for the reconstruction of Ram fortress.

ANSI device numbers

In the design of electrical power systems, the ANSI standard device numbers (ANSI /IEEE Standard C37.2 "Standard for Electrical Power System Device Function Numbers, Acronyms, and Contact Designations ") identifies the features of a protective device such as a relay or circuit breaker. These types of devices protect electrical systems and components from damage when an unwanted event occurs, such as an electrical fault. Device numbers are used to identify the functions of devices shown on a schematic diagram. Function descriptions are given in the standard. 
One physical device may correspond to one function number, for example "29 Isolating Switch", or a single physical device may have many function numbers associated with it, such as a numerical protective relay. Suffix and prefix letters may be added to further specify the purpose and function of a device. 
ANSI/IEEE C37.2-2008 is one of a continuing series of revisions of the standard, which originated in 1928.
Bold text== List of device numbers and acronyms==
Suffixes and prefixes.
A suffix letter or number may be used with the device number; for example, suffix N is used if the device is connected to a Neutral wire (example: 59N in a relay is used for protection against Neutral Displacement); and suffixes X,Y,Z are used for auxiliary devices. Similarly, the "G" suffix can denote a "ground", hence a "51G" is a time overcurrent ground relay. The "G" suffix can also mean "generator", hence an "87G" is a Generator Differential Protective Relay while an "87T" is a Transformer Differential Protective Relay. "F" can denote "field" on a generator or "fuse", as in the protective fuse for a pickup transformer. Suffix numbers are used to distinguish multiple "same" devices in the same equipment such as 51-1, 51–2.
Device numbers may be combined if the device provides multiple functions, such as the instantaneous/time-delay AC over current relay denoted as 50/51.
For device 16, the suffix letters further define the device: the first suffix letter is 'S' for serial or 'E' for Ethernet. The subsequent letters are: 'C' security processing function (e.g. VPN, encryption), 'F' firewall or message filter, 'M' network managed function, 'R' router, 'S' switch and 'T' telephone component. Thus a managed Ethernet switch would be 16ESM.

This So-Called Miracle

"(This So-Called) Miracle" (Atlantic 87750; Atlantic Japan AMDY-5042) is the second single from the 1990 album "Anything Is Possible" (LP 82167) by American singer-songwriter-actress Deborah Gibson. Edited from the original LP Version (7:28) (as written and produced by Gibson) and released in the U.S., Australia and Japan in February 1991, this ballad became Gibson's first single not to make an impression on any main singles chart in its areas of release. (NOTE: The single title was parenthesized, but not so the album track on LP 82167.)

Peter Keisler

Peter D. Keisler (born October 13, 1960 in Hempstead, New York) is an American lawyer whose 2006 nomination by President George W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit became embroiled in partisan controversy. Presently a partner at the firm of Sidley Austin in Washington, D.C., he formerly was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. Upon the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, until November 9, 2007, he was also the Acting Attorney General of the United States.
Background.
A 1977 graduate from George W. Hewlett High School in Long Island, New York, Keisler went to Yale University both for undergraduate and law school. As an undergraduate, Keisler was the Chairman of the Party of the Right (Yale) and the Speaker of the Yale Political Union. He graduated magna cum laude from Yale College in 1981 and then entered Yale Law School. In 1982, he helped to co-found the Federalist Society, a conservative thinktank. He received his J.D. in 1985. After law school, Keisler clerked for Judge Robert Bork on the D.C. Circuit from 1985 to 1986. After this clerkship, he joined the Office of Legal Counsel under President Ronald Reagan. There, he worked on both the Supreme Court nominations of his former boss, Robert Bork, and the man who replaced Bork as a Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy. After Kennedy was confirmed, he hired Keisler to be one of his four law clerks during his first year on the Court in 1988. One of his fellow clerks during that year was Miguel Estrada, another conservative nominee to the D.C. Circuit whose nomination was controversially filibustered by the Democrats in 2003. 
After finishing his Supreme Court clerkship, Mr. Keisler became a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Sidley Austin. He specialized in general and appellate litigation and telecommunications law, and argued before the Supreme Court and numerous federal Courts of Appeals. In 2002, he left his job in order to join the Department of Justice. He joined the Department on June 24, 2002, as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General. 
Peter Keisler was sworn in as the Civil Division's Assistant Attorney General on July 1, 2003. In that capacity, most of his legal work was clearly dictated by his role as head of a component obligated to defend government policies and statutes. Consistent with this role, Mr. Keisler was involved in defending the Bush Administration’s policies in the Global War on Terror. He has also represented the government in defense of laws protecting access to abortion clinics and imposing requirements on telemarketing companies.
In probably the most well-known case he handled, Keisler argued on behalf
of the government in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in the D.C. Circuit and participated in both the case's appellate and Supreme Court briefs. In addition, he personally led the team that responded to a legal appeal by Sabin Willett, the lawyer for the seventeen remaining Uyghur captives in Guantanamo, 
that tested the use of a provision of the Detainee Treatment Act in terms of whether or not captives could challenge the rulings of their Combatant Status Review Tribunals.
On September 6, 2007, Keisler announced his resignation from the Department of Justice in order to "spend time with his family."
On September 17, 2007, President Bush announced that Keisler had agreed to remain at the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General until the Senate confirmation of a new Attorney General; Bush also announced the nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General at the same time.
D.C. Circuit nomination under Bush.
Originally, Keisler, a resident of Bethesda, Maryland and a practising lawyer in Washington, D.C., was considered for a Maryland seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit during the spring of 2001. Maryland's two Democratic senators, Paul Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski, however, blocked the White House from making the nomination on the grounds that Keisler did not have strong enough ties to the Maryland legal community.
Keisler was later nominated for a position on the D.C. Circuit on June 29, 2006 by President George W. Bush to fill a seat vacated by John Roberts, whom Bush appointed Chief Justice of the United States in 2005. At the time, the 109th Senate was controlled by the Republican Party. On August 1, 2006, he received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate on September 29, 2006 returned the nomination to the President without acting on it, prior to adjourning for the 2006 elections, on September 30, 2006.
After the 2006 midterm congressional elections (in which the Democrats reclaimed control of the Senate), President Bush renominated Keisler on November 15, 2006. The Senate returned the nomination to Bush on December 9, 2006 without acting on the nomination, before the 109th Congress's final adjournment. President Bush renominated Keisler on January 9, 2007 for consideration by the Senate during the 110th Congress. The Democratic leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, refused to act on the nomination.
It was reported at the time that the Democrats in the Senate did not want to confirm Keisler for four basic reasons. First, he was a co-founder of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group which many Democrats saw as seeking to control the federal judiciary. He had been on its board of directors from 1983 until 2000. Second, he clerked for Robert Bork, a conservative Republican judge whose nomination to the Supreme Court was embroiled in controversy before being rejected in 1987 by a Senate controlled by the Democrats. Third, during Keisler's tenure at the DOJ, he was instrumental in defending some of the most controversial policies of Republican President George W. Bush concerning the Global War on Terror. Finally, he was seen as being a possible Republican nominee to the Supreme Court.
Current life.
On March 18, 2008, it was announced that Keisler would be returning to his former position as a partner of Sidley Austin as a global coordinator of the firm’s appellate practice in its Washington, D.C. office. On October 21, 2008, Sidley Austin announced that Keisler would be joining the firm's Executive Committee, the committee that exercises general authority over the affairs of the firm.
Keisler and his wife, Susan, have three children.
