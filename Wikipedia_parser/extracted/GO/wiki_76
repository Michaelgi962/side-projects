Youngosuchus

Youngosuchus is an extinct genus of archosauriform from the Middle Triassic of China. The type species is "Y. sinensis". "Y. sinensis" was first described in 1973 as a new species of the erythrosuchid "Vjushkovia". In 1985, it was reassigned as its own genus of rauisuchid. Some more recent studies support the original classification of "Youngosuchus sinensis" as an erythrosuchid, but others still classify it as a rauisuchian.
Description.
"Youngosuchus" is known from a well-preserved skeleton recovered from the Kelamayi Formation in the Junggur Basin of Xinjiang, China. The skeleton, referred to as IVPP V 3239, includes a complete skull, cervical vertebrae, ribs, the pectoral girdle, and forelimbs. "Youngosuchus" has a large, deep skull with sharp recurved teeth. Osteoderms are not present on the skeleton, a possible indication that "Youngosuchus" did not have the body armor present in other early archosauriforms.
Classification.
The skeleton of "Youngosuchus" was first described in 1973 by Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, better known as C.C. Young. Young described it as "Vjushkovia sinensis", a third species of the erythrosuchid genus "Vjushkovia". Erythrosuchids are basal archosauriforms that are closely related to Archosauria, the group that includes living crocodiles and birds. In 1985, Russian paleontologists N.N. Kalandadze and Andreii Sennikov erected "Youngosuchus" as a new genus for "V. sinensis", naming it after Young. They considered the two other species of "Vjushkovia" to members of the erythrosuchid genus "Garjainia", and reclassified "Y. sinensis" as a rauisuchid. Rauisuchids are more derived than erythrosuchids because they lie within Archosauria, specifically within the clade Crurotarsi.
"Youngosuchus" lacks several common erythrosuchid features. The skull table of "Youngosuchus" is flat, while in erythrosuchids the same region is slightly depressed. The depression of erythrosuchids is a remnant of the pineal foramen that was present in more primitive reptiles. The lack of a depression in the skull table of "Youngosuchus" suggests that it belongs to a more derived group than erythrosuchids. Another difference between "Youngosuchus" and erythrosuchids can be seen in the antorbital fenestra, a hole in the skull in front of the eyes. In "Youngosuchus", the fenestra is large and triangular, but lacks the depressed upper and front margins seen in the skulls of erythrosuchids.
The assignment of "Youngosuchus" to Rauisuchidae is not widely accepted. Paleontologist J. Michael Parrish kept "Y. sinensis" as a species of "Vjushkovia" in his 1992 study of erythrosuchids, and continued to recognize "Vjushkovia" as a valid taxon distinct from "Garjainia". Sennikov, along with paleontologist David J. Gower, rejected Parrish's conclusions in 2000 by considering "V. triplocostata", the type species of "Vjushkovia", a junior synonym of "Garjainia prima". In his 2000 overview of rauisuchians, Gower did not consider "Y. sinensis" to be a synonym of "G. prima", instead suggesting that it was a rauisuchid.

Pierrot lunaire (book)

Pierrot lunaire: rondels bergamasques ("Moonstruck Pierrot: bergamask rondels") is a collection of fifty poems published in 1884 by the Belgian poet Albert Giraud (born Emile Albert Kayenburgh), who is usually associated with the Symbolist Movement. The protagonist of the cycle is Pierrot, the comic servant of the French Commedia dell'Arte and, later, of Parisian boulevard pantomime. The early 19th-century Romantics, Théophile Gautier most notably, had been drawn to the figure by his Chaplinesque pluckiness and pathos, and by the end of the century, especially in the hands of the Symbolists and Decadents, Pierrot had evolved into an alter-ego of the artist, particularly of the so-called poète maudit. He became the subject of numerous compositions, theatrical, literary, musical, and graphic.
Giraud's collection is remarkable in several respects. It is among the most dense and imaginatively sustained works in the Pierrot canon, eclipsing by the sheer number of its poems Jules Laforgue's celebrated "Imitation of Our Lady the Moon" (1886). Its poems have been set to music by an unusually high number of composers (see Settings in various media below), including one, Arnold Schoenberg, who derived from it one of the landmark masterpieces of the 20th century. Finally, it is noteworthy for the number of themes of the fin-de-siècle—which is to say, of Symbolism, the Decadence, and early Modernism—that it elaborates within the tight confines of Giraud's verse form:
Verse form, style, and structure.
Each of Giraud's poems is a rondel, a form he admired in the work of the Parnassians, especially of Théodore de Banville. (It is a "bergamask" rondel, not only because the jagged progress of the poems recalls the eponymous rustic dance, but also because 19th-century admirers of the Commedia dell'Arte characters "masks" often associated them with the Italian town of Bergamo, from which Harlequin is said to have hailed.) Unlike many of the Symbolist poets (though certainly not all: Verlaine, Mallarmé, even the early Rimbaud and Laforgue, worked comfortably within strict forms), Giraud found free verse to be anathema. He exclaimed to his friend Emile Verhaeren, after reading the latter's "Les Moines" ("The Monks"), "What I disapprove of with horror, what angers and irritates me is your improvising disdain for verse form, your profound and vertiginous ignorance of prosody and language." Such an attitude leads the critic Robert Vilain to conclude that, while Giraud shared "the Symbolists' concern for the careful, suggestive use of language and the power of the imagination to penetrate beyond the surface tension of the here-and-now", he was equally committed to a Parnassian aesthetic. He adheres to the sparer of the rondel forms, concluding each poem with a quintet rather than a sestet and working within strictly observed eight-syllable lines. As is customary, each poem is restricted to two rhymes alone, one masculine, the other feminine, resulting in a scheme of ABba abAB abbaA, in which the capital letters represent the refrains, or repeated lines. Within this austere structure, however, the language is—to use Vilain's words—"suggestive" and the imaginative penetration beneath the "here-and-now" daring and provocative.
Like Laforgue after him, Giraud uses neologisms ("Bourrèle!" ["Executioner!" or "Torturer!"]), unusual word choices ("patte" usually means "paw" for Pierrot's foot), and ambiguities ("Arlequin porte un arc-en-ciel", meaning "Harlequin bears "carries" or "wears" a rainbow") to enrich the fantastic atmosphere of the poems. His syntax is sometimes elliptical or fractured, as in the first line of the cycle: "Je rêve un théâtre de chambre" ("I dream a chamber theater"), instead of the usual "Je rêve "d'un" théâtre de chambre". And the imagery, especially in the similes, traffics often in the jarringly unexpected. Sometimes it is lyrically tender (clouds are "like splendid fins/Of chameleonic fish of the sky" "The Clouds"); sometimes it is shockingly brutal (Pierrot's thought of his "last mistress", the gallows, "is like a nail/That drunkenness drives into his head" "The Gallows' Song"). At its most dreamlike, it has a disturbing obscurity of reference ("sinister"—and unexplained—"black butterflies" swarm in the sky and blot out the sun "Black Butterflies"); at times it suspends all laws of materiality (a moonbeam penetrates the "varnished case" of a violin to caress its "soul" with its "irony"—"like a luminous white bow" "Lunar Violin"). The result is Dalí-esque: a series of sharply etched transcriptions of proto-Surreal visions. "With its Baroque intensity of detail and its fin de siècle aura," as Giraud's American translator writes, ""Pierrot Lunaire" is a work not to be forgotten."
Because the rondel is such a tightly "closed" form, each poem seems to stand as an independent unit, isolated from the other poems around it. Giraud heightens this sense of disconnection by eschewing sustained narrative, presenting Pierrot's situation as a series of stark vignettes. Sometimes these vignettes are clustered rather coherently (as in those dealing with Pierrot-as-modern-Christ—27: "The Church", 28: "Evocation", 29: "Red Mass", and 30: "The Crosses"), but, more often than not, they seem random in their placement (and thus may be explained, at least in part, Schoenberg's not scrupling to change their order in his song-cycle). The effect of all these structural and stylistic techniques is both comic and unsettling, as the poem "Disappointment" (4: "Déconvenue") suggests:
Les convives, fourchette au poing,Ont vu subtiliser les litres,Les rôtis, les tourtes, les huîtres,
Et les confitures de coing.
Des Gilles, cachés dans un coin,Tirent des grimaces de pitres.Les convives, fourchette au poing,Ont vu subtiliser les litres.
Pour souligner le désappoint,Des insectes aux bleus élytres,Viennent cogner les roses vitres,Et leur bourdon nargue de loinLes convives, fourchette au poing.
(The guests, their forks in their fists,Have seen the bottles snatched away,The roasts, the pies, the oysters,And the quince jam.
A few Gilles, hidden in a corner,Pull clown faces.The guests, their forks in their fists,Have seen the bottles disappear.
To underscore the disappointment,Some insects with blue elytraCome beating against the rose-colored panes,And their distant buzzing tauntsThe guests, their forks in their fists.)
The scene is completely without context: the poem that precedes it, 3: "Pierrot-Dandy", is about Pierrot's making up his face with moonlight; the poem that follows it, 5: "Moon over the Wash-House", identifies the moon as a washerwoman. Nowhere else in the cycle is this party revisited; it is impossible, therefore, to understand the import of the gathering or the identity of the guests. (Are the "Gilles" among the guests? or are they part of the entertainment? Is it Pierrot who has whimsically stolen away the viands? or is it stingy Cassander?) The frozen gestures ("their forks in their fists"), the air of blank incomprehension (shared as much by the reader as by the guests), the finicking nicety of the language ("elytra" of "elytron" = "wing-case") all contribute to the ambiguous black comedy of the poem.
Synopsis.
In a familiar dichotomy of the Symbolists, "Pierrot lunaire" occupies a divided space: a public realm, over which the sun presides, and a private realm, dominated by the moon. The waking, sunlit world, populated by Pierrot's Commedia dell'Arte companions, is marked by deformity, degeneracy, avarice, and lust. Its Crispins are "ugly", and its Columbine "arches her back", apparently in expectation of sexual pleasure (1: "Theater"). The meretriciously multicolored Harlequin—"shining like a solar spectrum" (11: "Harlequin")—is an "artificial serpent" whose "essential goal" is "falsehood and deceit" (8: "Harlequinade"). An old serving-woman connives in his scheming by accepting a bribe to procure Columbine's favors (11: "Harlequin"). These puppets live under a sky swarming with "sinister black butterflies" that "seek blood to drink", having "extinguished the sun's glory" with their wings (19: "Black Butterflies"). The sun itself is nearing the end of that glory: at its setting it seems like a Roman reveler, "full of disgust", who slits his wrists and empties his blood into "filthy sewers" (20: "Sunset"). It is a "great sun of despair" (33: "The Storks").
Pierrot is of the dreaming, moonlit world. His is an enchanted interior space, in which sequestered violins are caressed by moonbeams, thereby setting their souls, "full of silence and harmony", thrumming (32: "Lunar Violin"). He lives there as an aloof "isolato," encountering in a "sparkling polar icicle" a "Pierrot in disguise" (9: "Polar Pierrot") and seeking, "all along the Lethe", not Columbine the fickle woman but her ethereal floral namesakes—"pale flowers of moonbeams/Like roses of light" (10: "To Columbine"). The moon is, aptly, a "pale washerwoman" (5: "Moon over the Wash-House") whose ablutions minister chiefly to the mind. For Pierrot has lost the happy enchantments of the past: the moribund pantomimic world seems "absurd and sweet, like a lie" (37: "Pantomime"), and the "soul" of its old comedies, to which he sometimes mentally propels himself, with an imaginary oar of moonlight (36: "Pierrot's Departure"), is "like a soft crystal sigh" bemoaning its own extinction (34: "Nostalgia").
Now, at the end of the century, Pierrot resides in a "sad mental desert" (34: "Nostalgia"). He is bored and splenetic: "His strange, mad gaiety/Has flown away, like a white bird" (15: "Spleen"). Too often the moon seems like a "nocturnal consumptive" tossing about on the "black pillow of the skies", deceiving the "carefree lover passing by" into mistaking for "graceful rays/white and melancholy blood" (21: "Sick Moon"). When he cannot find relief in her customary magic—in the "strange absinthe" of her beams, this "wine that we drink with our eyes" (16: "Moon-Drunk")—he takes pleasure in tormenting his enemies: he makes music by drawing a bow across Cassander's pot-belly (6: "Pierrot's Serenade"); he bores a hole in his skull as a bowl for his pipe (45: "Cruel Pierrot"). (Cassander is a target because he is an "academician" [37: "Pantomime", a dry-as-dust guardian of the Law.) Madness seems to be lurking at Pierrot's elbow, as when he makes up his face with moonlight (3: "Pierrot-Dandy"), then spends an evening trying to brush a spot of it from his black jacket (38: "Moon-Brusher"). At his most despairing, he is visited by thoughts of his "last mistress"—the gallows (17: "The Song of the Gallows"), at the end of whose rope he dangles in "his white Moon robe" (18: "Suicide"). That the moon, indeed, seems to connive in his extinction is suggested by its sometime appearance as "a white saber/On a somber cushion of watered silk" that threatens to come whistling down on Pierrot's neck (24: "Decapitation").
His consolation is that the art in which he resides will have eternal life: "Beautiful verses are great crosses/On which red Poets bleed" (30: "The Crosses"). The old succor of religion is replaced by that of poetry, but at a cost—and with a difference. What is summoned to "the altar of verses" is not the gentle Mary but the "Madonna of Hysteria", who holds out "to the incredulous universe/[Her Son, with his limbs already green,/His flesh sagging and decayed" (28: "Evocation"). To the assembled faithful, Pierrot offers his heart: "Like a red and horrible Host/For the cruel Eucharist" (29: "Red Mass"). The new Lamb of God is a consumptive, his Word a confession of both self-sacrifice and impotence.
The poet and Pierrot.
Giraud's imagined identification of himself with his protagonist is complete; it is, in fact, often difficult to determine whether the subject of a given poem is Pierrot or Giraud. (To distinguish a "narrator" here is probably to make too nice a distinction.) The "I" that makes occasional appearances claims relation to Pierrot "through the Moon"; he lives, like Pierrot, "by sticking out. . ./ bleeding tongue at the Law" (13: "To my Bergamask Cousin"). Also like Pierrot, he "discovers drunken landscapes" in absinthe (22: "Absinthe") and savors the "morbid and mournful charm"—"Like a bloody drop of spittle/From a consumptive's mouth"—of melancholy music (26: "Chopin Waltz"). Both are nostalgic for Pierrot's past, that "adorable snow" of yesteryear, when the "zanni" of the old comedies was a "lyre-bearer,/Healer of wounded spirits" (31: "Plea"). And both are staunch in their commitment to an anti-materialistic idealism, Giraud seeing in the whiteness of Pierrot—and of snow, swans, and lilies—a "scorn of unworthy things" and a "disgust for weak hearts" (40: "Sacred Whitenesses"). Art they hold in worshipful regard: Giraud's book, his "poem", is "a ray of moonlight stoppered up/In a beautiful flagon of Bohemian glass" (50: "Bohemian Crystal"). But, paradoxically, both, as artists, are self-estranged: ironically, the interior quest for "sacred whitenesses", for a purity of soul, is synonymous with the assumption of a falsehood, a mask—one of theatrically clownish extravagance that borders on madness and fatal excess.
In 39: "The Alphabet", an apparent anomaly in the cycle, in which Giraud imagines himself as Harlequin, not Pierrot, the poet recalls dreaming, as a child, of "a multicolored alphabet,/In which each letter was a mask", a dream that agitates his "foolish heart" today. It is a revealing confession: an admission that the agents of his creations as an artist, the alphabet, are ideally not agents of self-expression but of self-fabrication under the mask of an Other. And this Other—Pierrot—is himself a fabrication, a mercurial puppet in a "chamber theater" of the mind (1: "Theater"). "Pierrot lunaire" offers a performance, not an expression, of the self—a fact in which much of its "modernity" resides.
Settings in various media.
In 1892, the poet and dramatist Otto Erich Hartleben published a German translation of "Pierrot lunaire"; he retained the rondel form of the poems, but he attempted no rhymes, altered line lengths, and made other substantive changes. Some commentators see his versions as improvements on the originals, although recent criticism has shifted somewhat in Giraud's favor. However their respective merits will eventually be judged, it was Hartleben's versions that first drew composers to the poems and that provide the texts for almost all of the settings we have. The bullet-point that follows lists early 20th-century musical settings chronologically and notes how many poems were set by each composer (all, except Prohaska's, are in the Hartleben translations) and for which instruments.
The most famous of these settings is Schoenberg's atonal "Thrice-Seven Poems from Albert Giraud's "Pierrot lunaire"" (1912), scored for what is now known as the Pierrot ensemble and a "Sprechstimme" voice.
The importance of this work in the musical world was signaled by an homage paid by the Arnold Schoenberg Institute in Los Angeles as recently as 1987: it commissioned the settings of the remaining twenty-nine poems that Schoenberg had neglected, utilizing the Pierrot ensemble ("Sprechstimme" optional), by sixteen American composers—Milton Babbitt, Leslie Bassett, Susan Morton Blaustein, Paul Cooper, Miriam Gideon, John Harbison, Donald Harris, Richard Hoffmann, Karl Kohn, William Kraft, Ursula Mamlok, Stephen L. Mosko, Marc Neikrug, Mel Powell, Roger Reynolds, and Leonard Rosenman. The settings were given their premieres between 1988 and 1990 in four concerts sponsored by the Institute. (The director of the Institute, Leonard Stein, added a setting of his own to the final concert of the project.)
Schoenberg's "Pierrot" has kindled inspiration not only among fellow composers but also among choreographers and singer-performers. Dancers who have staged "Pierrot lunaire" include the Russian-born American Adolph Bolm (1926), the American Glen Tetley (1962), the German Marco Goecke (2010) and the French Kader Belarbi (2011). Also, the avant-garde ‘’Triadic Ballet’’ (1923) by Oskar Schlemmer and Paul Hindemith was inspired by Schoenberg’s song-cycle. The theatrical/operatic possibilities of Schoenberg's score have been realized by at least two major ensembles: the Opera Quotannis, which staged a version of "Pierrot lunaire" (with singer Christine Schadeberg) at the New School for Social Research in 1995 and, more recently, the internationally acclaimed contemporary music sextet eighth blackbird, which premiered a "cabaret opera" dramatizing the Schoenberg cycle in 2009. Its percussionist, Matthew Duvall, played Pierrot, and, in addition to the remaining five musicians and a singer/speaker, Lucy Shelton, the production included a dancer, Elyssa Dole. The work, which was toured in 2012 to mark the centennial of Schoenberg's composition of "Pierrot lunaire", was conceived, directed, and choreographed by Mark DeChiazza. (.)
How inextricable the Giraud and Hartleben poems had become by the late 20th century is suggested by two works. The first, "Pierrot Lunaire" of 1982, is a retranslation of the Hartleben versions back into French by the poets Michel Butor and Michel Launay, who conclude the volume with poems of their own inspired by Giraud. The second, "Variations: Beyond Pierrot" (1995), is a work by the American composer Larry Austin. Each of its three ten-minute sections features a "Sprechstimme" soprano who sings fragments of Schoenberg's 21 selections accompanied by flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano. She sometimes renders those fragments in Giraud's original French, sometimes in Hartleben's German, at other times in English and Japanese. Drawing upon live computer-processed sound and computer-processed prerecorded tape, the composition attempts (in Austin's words) to go "beyond Schoenberg's musical melodrama" to create a "multi-lingual dream of the essences of the poems".
In 2001 and 2002, the British composer Roger Marsh set all fifty French poems for a (mostly) "a cappella" group of singers. Sometimes they sing in French accompanied by a narrator, whose English translations are woven into the music; sometimes they sing in both French and English; sometimes they speak the poems in both languages (in various combinations). The few songs entirely in French are intended to be glossed by action in performance. Instruments occasionally brought in, usually solo, are violin, cello, piano, organ, chimes, and beatbox. The English texts were derived from literal translations of Giraud's poems by Kay Bourlier.
Giraud's original texts (and apparently one of Hartleben's) also stand behind the "Seven Pierrot Miniatures" (2010) by the Scottish composer Helen Grime, though hers cannot be called "settings", since voice and words are absent. The seven poems she selected—12: "The Clouds", 2: "Decor", 22: "Absinthe", 18: "Suicide", 27: "The Church", 20: "Sunset", and "The Harp", none used by Schoenberg—were merely "points of departure" for her suite for mixed ensemble.
In 2013, the Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz set the poet Wayne Koestenbaum's ten "Pierrot Lunaire" poems (2006)—all original in content, though retaining titles from the Giraud/Schoenberg cycles—to a theatrical score for tenor and the Pierrot ensemble. In these new settings, Pierrot, "erotomane, cinéaste, clown, troubadour, analysand, synaesthete", goes wandering "through circles of a moonlit inferno, where he confronts shadows of charmed, histrionic luminaries, including Susan Sontag, Virginia Woolf, Patty Duke, Mae West, Diana Vreeland. ..."
The painters Paul Klee, Theodor Werner, Marc Chagall, Markus Lüpertz, and Fernando Botero have all produced a "Pierrot Lunaire" (in 1924, 1942, 1969, 1984, and 2007, respectively). The British writer Helen Stevenson published a Chinese-box-like, postmodern set of variations on Giraud's poems in her 1995 novel "Pierrot Lunaire", and Bruce LaBruce released his Canadian/German film "Pierrot Lunaire", a gender-bending interpretation of the Schoenberg cycle, in 2014. Pierrot Lunaire is also a familiar figure in postmodern popular art: Brazilian, Italian, and Russian rock groups have called themselves Pierrot Lunaire. The Soft Machine, a British group, included the song "Thank You Pierrot Lunaire" in its 1969 album Volume Two. And in issue #676 of DC Comics, "Batman R.I.P.: Midnight in the House of Hurt" (2008), Batman acquired a new nemesis, who shadowed him for eight more issues: his name was Pierrot Lunaire.

Seward Airport

Seward Airport is a state-owned, public-use airport located two nautical miles (2.3 miles; 3.7 km) northeast of the central business district of Seward, a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. This airport is included in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a "general aviation" facility.
History.
The airport was built during World War II. It was named Walseth Air Force Base and was closed by the United States Air Force in April 1947. It was excessed to the War Assets Administration and taken over by the Territory of Alaska.
Facilities and aircraft.
Seward Airport covers an area of at an elevation of 22 feet (7 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 13/31 is 4,240 by 100 feet (1,292 x 30 m) and 16/34 is 2,279 by 75 feet (695 x 23 m).
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2009, the airport had 10,510 aircraft operations, an average of 28 per day: 57% general aviation, 43% air taxi, and <1% military. At that time there were 25 single-engine aircraft based at this airport.

Zettai Zetsumei (album)

Background and development.
After the band's 2009 tour for their previous album, "Altcolony no Teiri", the band did not perform or do any band activities for six months, with Noda in this time going to the studio alone and recording demo tapes. After the release of "Altocolony no Teiri", Noda felt too cautious in writing lyrics, due to the mistakelessness he had strived for in "Altocolony no Teiri". In Summer 2010, the album had begun to take shape, with most of the songs in a self-completed state. Noda felt that the album was free from many of the constraints in the band's previous work, and that it was a high-energy album. He experimented with hip-hop in "G-kōi" and jazz-style piano in "Pi".
All of the songs on the album are sung entirely in Japanese, except for a brief English phrase in "G-kōi." This is very different from the band's past albums, which generally feature a few entirely English language songs, and many with large sections sung in English.
Promotion and release.
On June 30, 2010, Radwimps released two singles simultaneously, "Manifesto" and "Keitai Denwa," which reached number two and three on Oricon's single charts, respectively, underneath "Wonderful World!!" by boyband Kanjani Eight. "Manifesto" did not appear on the album, and "Keitai Denwa" appeared as a re-arranged version.
Before the release of the album, the singles "Dada" and "Kyōshinshō" were released in January and February 2011. "Dada" reached number one on Oricon's single charts, becoming Radwimps second single to do so since their debut.
"Kimi to Hitsuji to Ao" was chosen as broadcaster NHK's theme song for soccer events in 2011, including the 2011 J. League Division 1, the first round of the 2012 AFC Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament in June and the 2011 Copa América in July. This is the band's first commercial tie-up since "EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"'s use as the music countdown show Count Down TV's opening theme song in early 2006. A music video, directed by Daisuke Shimada and Sōjirō Kamatani, was filmed for the song. The song was given radio play from February 23, as well as released as a ringtone. Also released as ringtones on the same day were "Daidarabocchi, ""Gakugeikai," and "Tōmei Ningen Jūhachi-gō."
Radwimps took part in Tower Records' "No Music, No Life?" advertisement campaign from March 8 until March 21, and were featured on in-store posters in Tower Records stores across Japan. The band will also make two appearances on Tokyo FM's "School of Lock!" on their regular program "Rad Locks!", airing in April and May 2011.
The band will tour across Japan between April and July 2011, on their , performing 37 dates.

Nicole Bartelme

Nicole Bartelme (born April 17, 1967) is an American artist and a pioneer of The TriBeCa Film Festival in Manhattan, New York City. Bartelme works in multiple genres including photography, interior/set design, poetry and sound. Bartelme received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1989. Her studies included Illustration, Film and Textiles.
TriBeCa.
As Director of the TriBeCa Partnership in 1997, an initiative of the umbrella organization, Association of Community Employment Programs (ACE), Bartelme left in 2000, to form a new entity: The TriBeCa Film Festival. Proceeds were designed to support ACE's out reach programs for The Homeless in New York City. Her premise for the Festival involved independent films that embrace a common humanity among people with unique sound tracks.
The first public call for entries, “Documentary Films: Give Context to World Issues” was printed in the "DownTown Express", December Issue, 2000. On December 9, 2001 within an hour after the website "tribecafilmfestival.com" was launched over 800 inquiries and congratulatory notes were posted. After the attacks to the World Trade Center, Bartelme negotiated and relinquished trade mark and intellectual property rights to The TriBeCa Film Center. Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro and Trina Wyatt subsequently commenced with the TriBeCa Film Festival in April 2002.
Influences.
Bartelme’s most celebrated exponents of assemblage are influenced by constructivism, with an injection of abstract expressionist painting and printmaking. Some ‘pieces’ are fronted with silk screen on glass pane. The subject provides personal documents or items that comprise these non-traditional portraits. Many combine oil pigments painted on copper with a reference to journalism’s graphic formatting. Columns and headlines are illustrated through torn fragments of texture that represent the body of text/words, punctuated by cast bronze periods. Like artist Kurt Schwitters, Bartelme is fascinated by fragments both personal and universal that evoke connections, found on sailing voyages to Venezuela or collected from flea markets from New York to Moab to Munich. 
Several images reference Bartelme’s photographs documenting eight winters of living on the historic "Pennacook", a Moran red tugboat built in 1898. These black and white images capture the individuals that lived on Pier 25, in Manhattan during the 1990s, of which she was awarded Top Photographer in her category of G-Technology's 2013 "Driven Creativity" Competition.
Books/Publications.
Bartelme was the editor and photographer of the independently published "TriBeCa Guide 2000".
Sound, Interiors, Set and Costume Design.
Bartelme’s work in sound and with the poetry of Hafez have been recorded on "The Green Sea of Heaven", translations by Elizabeth T. Gray Jr., White Cloud Press and "Water From The Well", by Reza Derakshani, Pomegranate Records, 2001. Much of the content recited in the poetry, literature and lore are inspirations for her visual works.
Interiors, both commercial and residential as well as Set Designs are an extension of Bartelme’s paintings/photographic collages. Patterns and textiles are the foundation. Backdrops have textures filled with reference, woven together with tension both torn and whole. Dancers held high reveal unfolding costumes that serve as a foreground scrim to conceal or reveal their movements. “Being connected to the TriBeCa Community serves as a lynch pin for my creative endeavors” Bartelme said, “It’s a think tank of colleagues and shared ideas”.

Lewis Brian Adams

Lewis Brian Adams was an English painter who spent most of his career in Venezuela. He studied at the Royal Academy of Art, and exhibited there for a number of years. Just why he came to Caracas is unknown, but it seems likely that he came to paint in a market where he could find less competition. He introduced a number of trends from English portraiture to the world of Venezuelan art.
Adams became acquainted with the Prussian painter Ferdinand Bellermann during the latter's time in Venezuela.

Marine Motor Drivers and Coxswains' Union of New South Wales

Marine Motor Drivers and Coxswains' Union of New South Wales was an Australian trade union existing between 1912 and 1967. The union represented workers employed as linesmen, coxswains, and driving motor boats carrying cargo or passengers.
Industrial Disputes.
As well as agitating for improvements in its members' pay and conditions through the Conciliation and Arbitration systems, the union also worked to maintain the high standard of skill amongst workers in the industry.
Amalgamation.
The Marine Motor Drivers and Coxswains' Union suffered from demarcation disputes with other maritime union, such as the Masters and Engineers' Association and the Firemen and Deckhands' Union of New South Wales(FDU), before finally amalgamating with the FDU in 1967. Don Henderson, of the FDU, would later acknowledge that a large part of the FDU's motivation in seeking amalgamation with the Marine Motor Drivers and Coxswains was the vital position of the linesmen, represented by the latter union, in port operations. The linesmen's role in securing moored ships meant they could halt all docking of ships in the event of an industrial dispute.

F. S. Platou

Frithjof Stoud Platou (21 August 1903 – 12 August 1980) was a Norwegian architect. He worked for the international architects Lars Backer and Erich Mendelsohn before he established his own architectural firm in Oslo. Among his most famous works are the Grand Hotel in Oslo, the Kon-Tiki Museum and Hotel Stefan.
Personal life.
Platou was born in Hamar to the banker Gabriel Andreas Stoud Platou (1858–1911) and his wife Ingeborg Sophie Falck (1864–1958). His only brother was Ragnar Stoud Platou, who later became a ship broker.
Platou was nephew of Christian Emil and Waldemar Stoud Platou, and cousin of Karen Platou.
In 1931, Platou married Aagot Jeanette Robsahm (1907–56), a daughter of wholesaler Andreas Robsahm (1878–1949) and his wife Aagot Manskow (1883–1970).
Career.
In 1921, he took an examen artium in Hamar. He thereupon travelled to Switzerland where he studied architecture at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich from 1922 to 1926. He also studied economics in London in 1925. Lars Backer thereafter employed him as assistant in Oslo. In 1929–30, Platou was employed by Erich Mendelsohn.
In 1930, Platou started his own architectural firm, which he named after himself. The Norwegian architects Otto Torgersen and Bernt Heiberg worked in his firm, which designed various functionalist buildings in Oslo. After the Second World War, the office was expanded with more architects, who designed many banking centers and enterprise buildings in Oslo. They also designed the Kon-Tiki Museum at Bygdøy and the headquarters of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities in Vika in the city centre. After a fire in 1957, Platou designed a new building for the Grand Hotel in Oslo the following year. In 1971, his architectural firm was converted into a limited company.
Platou was co-founder of Norconsult, and headed the company from 1963 to 1968. He also had honoraries in some other architectural organisations in Norway. He died on 12 August 1980.

Ancient Israelite cuisine

Ancient Israelite Cuisine refers to the food eaten by the ancient Israelites during a period of over a thousand years, from the beginning of the Israelite presence in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the Iron Age until the Roman period. The dietary staples were bread, wine and olive oil, but also included, in varying degrees, legumes, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat. Religious beliefs, which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, shaped the Israelite diet. There was considerable continuity in the main components of the diet over time, despite the introduction of new foodstuffs at various stages. The food of ancient Israel was similar to that of other ancient Mediterranean diets.
Sources.
Information about the food of the ancient Israelites is based on written sources, archaeological records and comparative evidence from the wider region of the ancient Levant:
The primary written source for the period is the Hebrew Bible, the largest collection of written documents surviving from ancient Israel. Other texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Apocryphal works, the New Testament, the Mishnah and the Talmud also provide information. Epigraphic sources include ostraca from Samaria and Arad.
The Bible provides names of plants and animals that were used for food, such as the lists of permitted and forbidden animals (for example, and ), and the lists of foods brought to the king’s table (for example, ) or the foods that the Israelites are said to have longed for after leaving Egypt (). These lists indicate the potential foods that were available, but not necessarily how regularly the food was eaten or how significant it was in the cuisine, which needs to be derived from other sources.
Archaeological remains include the items used for the production of food, such as wine or olive presses; stone and metal implements used in the preparation of food; and amphorae, jars, storerooms and grain pits used for storage. Animal bones provide evidence of meat consumption, the types of animals eaten, and whether they were kept for milk production or other uses, while paleobotanical remains, such as seeds or other carbonized or desiccated plant remains provide information about plant foods.
Using both written and archaeological data, some comparisons can be drawn between the food of ancient Israel and its neighbors. Although there is much information about the foods of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the inferences that can be made are limited due to differences in topography and climate; Israelite agriculture also depended on rainfall rather than the river-based irrigation of these two civilizations, resulting in the preference for different crops. Ugarit and Phoenicia were closer neighbors of ancient Israel, and shared a topography and climate similar to that of ancient Israel. Thus, conclusions about the food and drink in ancient Israel have been made with some confidence from this evidence.
History.
Significant milestones in the availability and development food production characteristic of Israelite cuisine occurred well before the Israelite period. On the other hand, vestiges of the cuisine and the practices associated with it continue to resonate in later Jewish cuisine and traditions that developed in Israel and Babylonia during the Talmudic period (200 CE – 500 CE), and may still be discerned in the various culinary styles that have developed among Jewish communities since then.
Pre-Israelite.
Wild species of barley and emmer wheat were domesticated and cultivated in the Jordan River Valley as early as the 9th millennium BCE. Archaeologists have found the carbonized seeds of two kinds of primitive wheat, einkorn and emmer, and two-rowed barley, in the earliest levels of digs at Jericho, one of the first inhabited cities in the world.
During the Pottery Neolithic period (6000 – 4300 BCE), the development of pottery enabled people to produce portable containers for the transportation and storage of food, and an economy based on agriculture and herding developed. Archaeological evidence indicates that figs, lentils and broad beans were being cultivated from Neolithic times.
During the Chalcolithic period (4300 – 3300 BCE), large pottery containers indicative of settled peoples, appear in the archaeological record. Date palm cultivation began in the Jordan River Valley, and the earliest date pits have been discovered at Ein Gedi by the Dead Sea. In the Golan, olives trees were grown and olive oil was produced there.
Chickpea cultivation dates back to the Bronze Age (3300 – 1200 BCE) and grapes and olives became important crops in the hill country. Wine and oil were traded for wheat with the cities on the coastal plain, and for meat and skins with semi-nomadic herders. Wine and carobs were also exported to Egypt during this period. At Arad in the northern Negev, the remains of wheat, barley and legumes have been found, along with stone lined storage pits for grain from this period. Pottery was imported from Cyprus and Mycenae in Greece for the first time, probably for use as good quality tableware. After the Bronze Age collapse of urban culture, there was an increase in herding and the disappearance of smaller agricultural communities.
Israelite period.
The Israelite presence emerged during the Early Iron Age (1200–1000 BCE), at first in the central hill country, Transjordan and the northern Negev, and later in the Galilee, while the Philistines and other Sea Peoples arrived at roughly the same time and settled in the coastal regions. Pastoralism and animal husbandry remained important, and walled open spaces in villages that probably served as paddocks have been discovered. The construction of terraces in the hills, and of additional plastered cisterns for water storage, enabled more cultivation than before. Storage pits and silos were dug into the ground to hold grain. Under the united Israelite monarchy, central store cities were built, and greater areas of the northern Negev came under cultivation. The Gezer agricultural calendar detailing the crops that were raised, dates from this period.
After the division of the Israelite kingdom, Jerusalem and a number of other cities expanded, supported by the surrounding villages and farms. These were called “daughters of” the major towns in the Hebrew Bible (for example, and ). Large food storage facilities and granaries were built, such as the city of Hazor. During the later Iron Age (Iron Age II) period, roughly the same period as the Israelite and Judean monarchies, olive oil and wine were produced on a large scale for commerce and export, as well as for local consumption.
The ancient Israelites depended on bread, wine and oil as the basic dietary staples and this trio is often mentioned in the Bible (for example, and ) and in other texts, such as the Samaria and Arad ostraca. Written and archaeological evidence indicate that the diet also included other products from plants, trees and animals. Seven basic agricultural products, called the Seven Species, are listed in the Bible: wheat, barley, figs, grapes, olives, pomegranates, and dates (). The Bible also often describes the land of Israel as a land "flowing with milk and honey" (for example, ).
The cuisine maintained many consistent traits based on the main products available from the early Israelite period until the Roman period, even though new foods became available during this extended time. For example, rice was introduced during the Persian era; during the Hellenistic period, as trade with the Nabateans increased, more spices became available, at least for those who could afford them, and more Mediterranean fish were imported into the cities; and during the Roman period, sugar cane was introduced.
Post-Second Temple era.
The symbolic food of the ancient Israelites continued to be important among Jews after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE or AD and the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora. Bread, wine, and olive oil were seen as direct links to the three main crops of ancient Israel — wheat, grapes, and olives. In the Bible, this trio is described as representing the divine response to human needs () and particularly the need for the seasonal rains vital for the successful cultivation of these three crops. (). The significance of wine, bread and oil is indicated by their incorporation into Jewish religious ritual, with the blessings over wine and bread for Sabbath and holiday meals and at religious ceremonies such as weddings, and the lighting of Sabbath and festival lights with olive oil.
Characteristics.
The daily diet of the ordinary ancient Israelite was mainly one of bread, cooked grains and legumes. Bread was eaten with every meal. Vegetables played a smaller, but significant role in the diet. The Israelites drank goat and sheep’s milk when it was available in the spring and summer, and ate butter and cheese. Figs and grapes were the fruits most commonly eaten, while dates, pomegranates and other fruits and nuts were eaten more occasionally. Wine was the most popular beverage and sometimes other fermented beverages were produced. Olives were used primarily for their oil. Meat, usually goat and mutton, was eaten rarely and was reserved for special occasions such as celebrations, festival meals or sacrificial feasts. Game, birds, eggs and fish were also eaten, depending on availability.
Most food was eaten fresh and in season. Fruits and vegetables had to be eaten as they ripened and before they spoiled. People had to contend with periodic episodes of hunger and famine; producing enough food required hard and well-timed labor, and the climatic conditions resulted in unpredictable harvests and the need to store as much food as possible. Thus, grapes were made into raisins and wine; olives were made into oil; figs, beans and lentils were dried; and grains were stored for use throughout the year. The diet was essentially vegetarian. A typical daily meal is illustrated by the biblical description of the rations that Abigail brought to David’s group: bread, wine, roasted grain, raisins and fig cakes ().
Foods.
Grains and bread.
Grain products comprised the majority of the food consumed by the ancient Israelites. The staple food was bread, and it was such a vital part of each meal that the Hebrew word for bread, "lehem", also referred to food in general. The supreme importance of bread to the ancient Israelites is also demonstrated by the fact that Biblical Hebrew has at least a dozen words for bread, and bread features in numerous Hebrew proverbs (for example, , ). Bread was eaten at just about every meal, and is estimated to have provided from 50 to 70 percent of an ordinary person’s daily calories. The bread eaten until the end of the Israelite monarchy was mainly made from barley flour; during the Second Temple period, bread from wheat flour become predominant.
Porridge and gruel were made from ground grain, water, salt and butter. This mixture also formed the basis for cakes, to which oil and fruits were sometimes added before baking.
The Israelites cultivated both wheat and barley. These two grains are mentioned first in the biblical list of the Seven Species of the land of Israel and their importance as food is also seen in the celebration of the barley harvest at the festival of Shavuot and of the wheat harvest at the festival of Sukkot.
Rice was introduced during the early Second Temple period through contact with the Persians. By the Roman period, rice had become an important export, and the Jerusalem Talmud states about rice that “there is none like it outside Israel,” and that notable rabbis served rice at the Passover seder.
Barley.
Barley ("hordeum vulgare") was the most important grain during the biblical period, and this was recognized ritually on the second day of Passover in the Omer offering, consisting of barley flour from the newly ripened crop. Furthermore, its significance to Israelite society, not only as a source of food, is illustrated by the biblical method for measuring a field by the amount of barley (rather than of wheat) with which it could be sown.
Barley was initially predominant because it matured earlier and tolerated harsher conditions than wheat, growing in areas with less rainfall and poorer soils, such as the northern Negev and the hill country. It had a high yield potential and was resistant to insect infestation. It could be sown without plowing, and could therefore be grown on small plots of land that oxen or even donkeys could not reach, and it did not need artificial irrigation. It ripened a month earlier than wheat and was thus available to replenish supplies used up during the winter sooner than wheat, and also provide some food security if the more vulnerable wheat crop was poor or failed.
Two varieties of barley were cultivated: two rowed and sixed rowed. Two rowed barley was the older, hulled form; six rowed barley was unhulled and easier to thresh, and since the kernels remained intact, store for longer periods. Hulled barley was thus the prevalent type during the Iron Age, but gruels made from it must have had a gritty taste due to the barley’s tough outer layers.
Bread was primarily made from barley flour during the Iron Age (, ), as barley was more widely and easily grown, and was thus more available, cheaper, and could be made into bread without a leavening agent even though wheat flour was regarded as superior. It was presumably made from dough that was a simple mixture of barley flour and water, divided into small pieces, formed by hand into round shapes and then baked.
However, barley declined as the staple from the biblical period, to a poverty food by the end of the Second Temple period, and by the Talmudic era it was regarded mostly as animal fodder.
Wheat.
Emmer wheat ("triticum dicoccum") was initially the most widespread variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat ("triticum durum"), a descendent of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore be separated from the husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.
However, durum is a hard grain and was difficult to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the "solet" required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued to be used for making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat ("triticum aestivum") replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop by the end of the Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.
Preparation of grains.
A series of developments in technology for threshing, milling and baking improved both the quantity and the quality of the grain and the means for preparation that were available, from the beginning of the Iron Age until the end of the Second Temple period:
In the early Iron Age, grain was threshed to remove it from the stalks by beating it with sticks or by oxen treading on it. This usually broke most of the grain kernels, which limited their storage time because broken kernels spoil more quickly than unbroken ones. The development of the threshing-board, which was pulled over the stalks by oxen, left most of the grain kernels intact and enhanced their storage time. Numerous threshing floors and threshing boards have been discovered at archaeological sites of ancient Israel.
Once separated from the stalks, the grain was used in a number of ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make gruel and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.
Bread making.
Bread was the main source of nourishment in biblical times and making bread was a daily activity:
Bread making began with the milling of the grain. It was a difficult and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and it is estimated that it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved back and forth over the grains (). This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.
After the grain was milled into flour, it was mixed with water and kneaded in a large trough. For dough made with wheat flour, starter, called "seor", was added. The starter was prepared by reserving a small portion of dough from a previous batch to absorb the yeasts in the air and thus help leaven the new dough. Seor thus gave the bread a sourdough flavor.
Once prepared, the dough could be baked in various ways:
Initially, the dough was placed directly on the heated stones of a cooking fire or in a griddle or pan made of clay or iron (). In the time of the First Temple, two types of oven were used for baking bread: the jar oven and the pit-oven. The jar-oven was a large pottery container, narrowing into an opening toward the top; fuel was burned on the inside to heat it and the dough was pressed against the outside to bake. The pit-oven was a clay-lined excavation in the ground in which the fuel was burned and then pushed aside, and the loaves were baked on the heated surface. People also began placing a convex dome, initially earthenware and later metal, over the pit-oven and cooking the flatbreads on the dome instead of on the ash-covered surface; this type of oven is probably what was meant by the biblical "machabat", often translated as “griddle”.
The Persians introduced a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an opening at the bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from the heat of the oven and ashes after the flames had died down. This continued to be the way in which Yemenite Jews baked bread until modern times. The remains of clay ovens, and fragments of bread trays have been found in several archaeological excavations.
All these methods produced only quite thin loaves and the custom was thus to break bread rather than cut it. The bread was soft and pliable and used for dipping and sopping up gravies and juices.
The Romans introduced an oven called a "furn" ("purni" in Talmudic Aramaic), a large, wood-burning, stone-lined oven with a bottom on which the dough or baking sheet was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible.
A variety of breads was produced. Probably most common were unleavened flat loaves called "ugah" or "kikkar". Another type was a thin wafer, known as a "rakik". A thicker loaf, known as "hallah" was made with the best quality flour, usually for ritual purposes.
Bread was sometimes enriched by the addition of flour from legumes (). The Mishna (Hallah 2:2) mentions bread dough made with fruit juice instead of water. The sugar in the juice, interacting with the flour and water, provided some leavening and sweetened the bread. The Israelites also sometimes added fennel and cumin to bread dough for flavor, and dipped their bread in vinegar, () olive or sesame oil for extra flavor.
Legumes.
After grain, legumes such as lentils, broad or fava beans, chickpeas and peas were the main element in the diet and were the main source of protein, since meat was rarely eaten.
Broad beans, chickpeas and lentils are the only legumes mentioned in the Bible but lentils, broad beans, chickpeas, fenugreek, field peas and bitter vetch have been found at Iron Age Israelite sites. By the Roman period, legumes are mentioned frequently in other texts. They are cited as one of the elements of the “wife’s food basket” in the Mishna (Ketubot 5:8), by which it is estimated that legumes supplied 17% of daily calories at that time.
Lentils were the most important of the legumes and were used to make pottages and soups, as well as cakes made from ground roasted lentils pressed and fried in oil and called "ashishim" (similar to Arabic felafel), such as those that King David is described as distributing to the people when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem.
Stews made of lentils or beans were common and they were cooked with onion, garlic and leeks for flavor. Fresh legumes were also roasted, or dried and stored for extended periods. They were then cooked in a soup or a stew. The Bible mentions roasted legumes (), and relates how Jacob prepared bread and a pottage of lentils for Esau ().
Vegetables.
Vegetables are not found often in the archaeological record and it is difficult to determine the role that they played, because plant foods were often eaten raw or were simply boiled, without requiring special equipment for preparation, and thus barely leaving any trace other than the type of food itself. Vegetables also are not mentioned often in the written record, and when the Bible does mention them, the attitude is mixed: sometimes they are regarded as a delicacy, but more often, they were held in low esteem (for example, (, ). Vegetables were perhaps a more important food at the extremes in society: the wealthy who could afford to dedicate land and resources to grow them, and the poor who depended on gathering them in the wild to supplement their meager supplies. More people may have gathered wild plants during famine conditions.
Vegetables that were commonly eaten included squash, leeks, garlic and onions, black radishes, net or muskmelons (sometimes misidentified as the cucumber) and watermelons. Other vegetables played a minor role in the diet of the ancient Israelites. Field greens and root plants were generally not cultivated and were gathered seasonally when they grew in the wild. Leafy plants included dandelion greens and the young leaves of the orach plant.
Leeks, onions and garlic were eaten both cooked in stews, and uncooked with bread, and their popularity may be indicated by the observation in the Bible that they are among the foods that the Israelites yearned for after leaving Egypt. Squash and melons were eaten raw, or flavored with vinegar. Black radishes were also were eaten raw when in season during the autumn and winter. The Talmud mentions the use of radish seeds to produce oil, and considered eating radishes to have health benefits.
Wild herbs were collected and were eaten uncooked or cooked. These are known to have included garden rocket and mallow and both leaf chicory and endive.
Wild lettuce, known as "chazeret", was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was cultivated from around 800 BCE. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and introduced by the Romans. Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as "merorim". "Chazeret" is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including chicory or endive ("ulshin"), horehound ("tamcha"), reichardia or eryngo ("charchavina") and wormwood ("maror").
Mushrooms, especially of the Boletus type, were gathered in many areas, particularly when plentiful after a major rainfall. The Talmud mentions mushrooms in connection with their exemption from tithes and as a desert at the Passover seder.
Sesame seeds were used in the preparation of oil, or were eaten dry, or were added to dishes such as stews as a flavoring; the leftovers after pressing out the oil were eaten in a cake form. The Hebrew for sesame, "shumshum", is related to the Akkadian "samassammu", meaning “oil plant”, as the seeds contain about 50% oil, which was pressed from the seeds. Sesame is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Mishna lists sesame oil as suitable for lighting the Sabbath lights, and the oil was also used for frying.
Fruit.
Fruit was an important source of food for the Israelites, particularly grapes, olives and figs. Grapes were grown mostly for wine, although some were eaten fresh at harvest time, or dried as raisins for storage while olives were grown exclusively for their oil, until the Roman period. Other fruits that were eaten were the date, pomegranate and sycamore fig.
The ancient Israelites built terraces of leveled areas in the hill country for planting a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables and fruit trees. All the trees, with the exception of the olive, produced fruit that could be eaten fresh or be made into fresh juice while in season. Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: Fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as "dvash" (honey). Grapes, figs, dates and apricots were also dried and preserved individually or put on a string or pressed into cakes. Since dried fruit are an efficient source of energy, they were prepared as provisions for journeys and long marches.
Olives and olive oil.
The olive is one of the biblical Seven Species and one of the three elements of the “Mediterranean triad” in Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used for not only as food and for cooking, but also for lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office.
The olive tree was well suited to the climate and soil of the Israelite highlands and a significant part of the hill country was allocated to the cultivation of olive trees, which were one of ancient Israel’s most important natural resources. Olive oil was more versatile and longer-lasting than the oil from other plants, such as sesame, and was also considered to be the best-tasting.
Although olives were used to produce oil from the Bronze Age, it was only by the Roman period that the techniques were introduced to cure olives in lye and then brine to remove their natural bitterness and make them edible as a food.
Olives were harvested in the late summer and were processed for oil by crushing the olives, pressing the mash and separating the oil from the flesh. In the early Iron Age period, this was done by treading the olives in basins cut into rock, or with a mortar or stone on a flat slab. In the later Iron Age period, the introduction of the beam press made large scale processing possible.
The discovery of many ancient olive presses in various locations indicates that olive oil production was highly developed in ancient Israel. The oil production center dating from the 7th century BCE discovered at Ekron, a Philistine city, has over one hundred large olive oil presses, and is the most complete olive oil production center from ancient times to be discovered. It indicates that ancient Israel was a major producer of olive oil for its residents as well as for other parts of the ancient Near East, such as Egypt and especially Mesopotamia. In addition to the large-scale olive oil production for commerce and export, presses have been found in ordinary houses, indicating that this was also a cottage industry.
Archaeological remains at Masada and other sites indicate that the most common olive cultivar was the indigenous Nabali, followed by the Souri. In Roman times, other olive cultivars were imported from Syria and Egypt.
There is also some written information about olive oil. The Bible describes its use in relation to certain sacrifices in which olive oil is used (for example, (, ). However, these sacrificial “recipes” can be assumed to represent some of the everyday uses of oil and methods for cooking and frying. Olive oil was mixed with flour to make bread in the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath () and is also noted as a valuable product for eating (). Olive oil is also mentioned on the Samaria and Arad ostraca.
The consumption of olive oil varied with social class – it was less available to the poor, but it may have become more available later in the Israelite period as the means of production improved and became more widespread. By early Roman times, the Mishna indicates that it was one of the four essential foods that a husband had to provide his wife, and it has been calculated that at a minimum, this represented about 11 percent of the overall calories supplied by the “food basket” described at that time.
Grapes.
Grapes are another of the biblical Seven Species and were used mainly for the production of wine, although they were also eaten fresh and dried. Grapes were dried in the sun to produce raisins, which could then be stored for a long time. Raisins were also pressed into clusters and dried as cakes, which kept the interior raisins softer.
Grapes were also used to produce a thick, honey-like liquid, called grape honey ("dvash anavim") that was used as a sweetener. Grape honey was made by treading the grapes in vats, but instead of fermenting the liquid produced, it was boiled to evaporate the water content, leaving behind the thick grape-honey syrup.
Figs.
Figs were an important source of food. Figs were cultivated throughout the land of Israel and fresh or dried figs were part of the daily diet. A common way of preparing dried figs was to chop them and press them into a cake.
Figs are one of the biblical Seven Species and are frequently mentioned in the Bible (for example, , and ). The remains of dried figs have been discovered from as early as the Neolithic period in Gezer, Israel and Gilgal in the Jordan Valley.
The fig tree ("ficus carica") grew well in the hill country and produced two crops a season. Early ripening figs were regarded as delicacy because of their sweetness and were eaten fresh. Figs ripening in the later harvest were often dried and strung into a chain, or pressed into hard round or square-shaped cakes called a "develah", and stored as a major source of winter food. The blocks of dried fig were sliced and eaten like bread.
The Mishna mentions figs as one the components of the prescribed “wife’s food basket” and they are estimated to have constituted 16% of the overall calories of the basket.
Dates.
Dates were eaten fresh or dried, but were used mostly boiled into thick, long-lasting syrup called “date honey” ("dvash temarim") for use as a sweetener. This syrup was prepared by soaking the dates in water for some time until they disintegrated and then boiling the resulting liquid down into thick syrup. The honey in the Biblical reference of “a land flowing with milk and honey” is date honey.
Fresh, ripe dates were available from the mid- to late-summer. Some were sun-dried and pressed into blocks to dry completely, and then used throughout the year, especially as food for travelers. Dates were also fermented into one of the “strong drinks” referred to in the Bible as “shechar”.
The date palm required a hot and dry climate and mostly grew and produced fruit in the Jordan Rift Valley, from Jericho to the Sea of Galilee. In these arid areas, the date was sometimes the only plant food available, and was a primary component of the diet, but it was less important elsewhere.
Pomegranates.
Pomegranates were usually eaten fresh, although occasionally they were used to make juice or wine, or sun-dried for use when the fresh fruit was out of season. They probably played a minor part in Israelite cuisine, but were symbolically important, as adornments on the hem of the robe of the high priest and the Temple pillars, and embossed on coinage, and are also listed in the Bible as one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel.
Other fruits and nuts.
Fruit, such as the sycamore fig, carob, mulberry, and possibly the apple were also eaten. Usually, these fruits were not cultivated but were picked in the wild when they were in season.
The sycamore fig ("ficus sycamorus") was very common in the warmer parts of Israel and was grown primarily for its wood, but it provided a steady supply of small figs, eaten mainly by the poor.
Other native trees producing fruits included the carob, which was probably popular due to its sweet taste, and the black mulberry.
The "tapuah", which means “apple” in modern Hebrew, is mentioned in the Bible, but it is not clear if this referred to another fruit, such as the quince.
Almonds, walnuts and pistachios were eaten and are mentioned in the Bible. Almonds were widespread in the region from prehistoric times and the Bible mentions almonds ("shaked") and pistachios ("botnim") as among the “choice fruits of the land” sent by Jacob as a gift to the ruler of Egypt (). Almonds and pistachios were probably eaten primarily by the wealthy. The walnut reached Israel from Mesopotamia by at least 2000 BCE and is mentioned once in the Bible (). Walnuts became common during the Second Temple period and so widespread that the word for walnut, "egoz", became the generic Hebrew word for nut at that time.
Wine and other drinks.
The Israelites usually drank water drawn from wells, cisterns or rivers. They also drank milk (for example, as mentioned in the Bible in ), often in the form of sour milk, thin yogurt or whey, when it was available in the spring and summer. They drank fresh juices from fruits in season as well. The most strongly preferred beverage was wine, although some beer may have also been produced and wine was an important part of the diet and a source of calories, sugar, and iron. Making wine was also a practical way to preserve fruit juices for long-term storage. Usually, wine was made from grapes for everyday use, as well as for rituals, such as sacrificial libations. Less often, wine was made from pomegranates and dates.
Wine.
The Mediterranean climate and soil of the mountainous areas of the area are well suited to viticulture, and both archaeological evidence and written records indicate the significant cultivation of grapes in ancient Israel and the popularity of wine-drinking. The production capacity apparent from archaeological remains and the frequent biblical references to wine suggest that it was the principal alcoholic beverage of the ancient Israelites. Based on the remains of wine production facilities and storage rooms, it has been estimated that on average, people could have consumed one liter of wine per person per day.
Many rock-hewn winepresses and vats, dating to the biblical period, have been found. One typical example at Gibeon has a wide surface for treading the grapes and a series of collecting vats. Archaeological finds at Ashkelon and Gibeon indicate large-scale wine production in the eighth and seventh centuries BCE, which most likely developed to supply the Assyrian empire, and then the Babylonians, as well as the local population. Vineyards are mentioned many times in the Bible, including in detailed descriptions of the method for establishing a vineyard () and the types of vines (). The Bible refers to several types of wine and one of the Arad ostraca also mentions wine among the supplies being sent to a garrison of soldiers.
Another indication of the importance of wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types of vines, grape varieties and words for wine. The word "yayin" was used both as a generic word for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called "tirosh". The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine.
The often coarse and unrefined taste of ancient wine was adjusted to make it more drinkable. Spices were added directly to the wine to improve the aroma, and other ingredients, such as honey, pepper, herbs and even lime, resin or seawater were added to improve the flavor or disguise a poor-tasting wine. Wine was also sweetened by the addition of grape juice syrup. Wine was also sometimes given an aroma by rubbing the winepress with wood resin. On the other hand, wine could also be added to drinking water to improve the taste, especially towards the end of the summer when rainwater had been standing in a cistern for at least six months. This also had the beneficial effect of lowering the bacteria content of the water.
After the grape harvest in mid-summer, most grapes were taken to wine presses to extract their juice for winemaking. Once fermented, wine was transferred to wineskins or large amphorae for storage. Israelite amphorae were typically tall with large handles and little decoration, and the handles were often inscribed with the name of the city in which the wine had been produced, the winemaker’s stamp and sometimes the year and the vintage. Amphorae made long term storage possible, especially in caves or cool cellars. Glass bottles were introduced only in the 1st century CE by the Romans.
The insides of amphorae were often coated with a preservative resin, such as from the terebinth, and this imparted a pine flavor and aroma to the wine. Before the jars were sealed with pitch, they were filled completely and often topped with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent spoilage due to exposure to air.
During the Greek period, the style of winemaking changed. Ripe grapes were first dried to concentrate the sugars, and these then produced a much sweeter and higher alcohol content wine that needed to be diluted with water to be drinkable. Before this, watered-down wine was disparaged, but by the time of the Talmud, wine that did not require dilution with water was considered unfit for consumption.
Beer.
Beer, produced by brewing barley, was another alcoholic beverage common in the ancient Near East. Beer was the primary beverage of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and it can be assumed that in Israel, which is located between the two, beer was also known. The biblical term "sekhar" may refer to beer or to alcoholic drinks in general.
The production of bread and beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, and most of the tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often drink beer. More recently, Iron Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, strainers and stoppers, all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer. Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking.
Meat.
The Israelites usually ate meat from domesticated goats and sheep. Goat’s meat was the most common. Fat-tailed sheep were the predominant variety of sheep in ancient Israel but as sheep were valued more than goats, they were eaten less often. The fat of the tail was considered a delicacy and even until modern times, it was prized in the cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews. Beef and venison were eaten primarily by the elites, and fattened calves provided veal for the wealthy (for example, as mentioned in the Bible, ).
For most people, meat was eaten only a few times a year when animals were slaughtered for the major festivals, or at tribal meetings, celebrations such as weddings, and for the visits of important guests (). Only at the king's table was meat served daily, according to the Bible.
Although most meat was obtained from domesticated animals, meat from hunted animals was also sometimes available, as the story of Isaac and Esau (), certain Biblical lists (for example, ), and archaeological evidence indicate. The remains of gazelle, red deer and fallow deer are the most commonly found in the archaeological record. Archaeological evidence from an Iron Age market excavated at Ashkelon shows that game was also sold to those who could not hunt or trap them themselves. 
However, meat from wild animals was more common at times of economic distress and in the northern areas, where forests and open land provided a habitat for more wild animals.
Meat was prepared in several different ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, ). Meat stewed with onions, garlic and leeks and flavored with cumin and coriander is described on ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, and it is most likely that it was prepared similarly in ancient Israel. Stewed meat was considered to be a dish worthy of serving to honored guests (). A less common way to prepare meat was to roast it over an open fire, but this was done particularly for the meat of the Passover lamb. For long-term storage, meat was smoked, dried or salted, according to indications in texts and ethnographic studies.
Poultry and eggs.
The Israelites ate domesticated birds such as pigeons, turtledoves, ducks and geese, and wild birds such as quail and partridge. Remains from archaeological excavations at the Ophel in Jerusalem and other Iron Age sites show that domestic birds were available, but consumption was small. The inclusion of pigeons and turtledoves in the Biblical sacrifice lists implies that they were raised domestically, and the remains of dovecotes discovered from the Greek and Roman periods confirm this. Biblical references and archaeological evidence also demonstrate that wild birds were hunted and eaten.
The turtledove was present from about April to October, while the rock pigeon was available throughout the year. The pigeon appears to have been domesticated in Sumeria and Canaan during the second millennium BCE, and remained the predominant fowl in ancient Israel until the end of the Second Temple period. Nonetheless, to avoid the spread of disease, pigeons could only be raised in small numbers and were thus fairly costly and not a regular part of the diet.
Geese, originally domesticated in ancient Egypt, were raised in ancient Israel. They are most likely the “fattened fowl” on King Solomon’s table (). Goose breeding is also discussed in the Mishna. Like other animals, birds were fattened for consumption on special occasions, and for the wealthy.
It is unclear when chicken became part of the diet. There are some archaeological remains from Iron Age sites, but these were likely from roosters as a fighting bird, which are also pictured on seals from the period as a symbol of ferocity, such as on the 6th century BCE onyx seal of Jaazaniah. Chicken became common around the 2nd century BCE, and during the Roman period, chickens emerged as an important feature of the cuisine, with the Talmud describing it as “the choicest of birds.” By Roman times pigeons and chickens were the principle poultry.
Until the domestication of the chicken, eggs were available in limited quantities and were considered a delicacy, as in ancient Egypt. The most common birds – turtledoves and pigeons – were reared for their meat and not for their very small eggs. Biblical references to eggs are only in reference to gathering them from the wild (for example, and ). Eggs seem to have increased in use for food only with the introduction of chickens as food, and were commonly used as food by Roman times.
Fish.
The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence. Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter’s fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea.
Fishermen supplied fish to inland communities, as remains of fish, including bones and scales, have been discovered at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted. Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article. Remains of Nile Perch from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried, before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies. Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby (, , , , ).
It is unclear to what extent fish played a role in the cuisine, but it is apparent that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive.
Dairy foods.
Goats, and to a lesser extent, sheep, provided milk for part of the year, and milk and dairy products were a significant source of food. Dairy products are mentioned in the Bible (for example, , , and , and a repeated description of the Land of Israel in the Bible is “a land flowing with milk and honey” (for example, , , and ).
Fresh milk could not be stored for long without spoiling. Typically, thick sour milk called "laban" was drunk because the Israelites stored the milk in skin containers, in which it curdled quickly.
Milk had to be processed to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time. Clarified butter was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BCE, and other ancient Israelite sites.
Goat milk and sheep’s milk cheeses were the most prevalent types of cheese. Soft cheese was made using cloth bags filled with soured milk. The thin liquid was drained through the cloth and soft cheese remained in the bag. A hard cheese was made from fermented soured milk: Milk was poured into special moulds in which it curdled and was then hardened by drying in the sun or by heating and numerous small cheese molds with holes for the draining the whey have been discovered. Cheese is not mentioned often in the Bible, but in one case, David is sent to take a gift of cheese to the commander of the army ().
The Mishna and Talmud mention using the sap of fruit trees, such as figs, to harden cheese (a method still used by nomadic herders of the region until modern times). Using fig sap instead of animal enzymes to make cheese also conformed to the prohibition on mixing meat and milk.
Honey.
Fruit syrup called “"dvash"” served as the primary sweetener and was most often made from dates. It was not until Talmudic times that the word “"dvash"”, now translated as “honey”, generally meant bee honey. The Biblical term “"dvash"” usually did not mean bee honey, but thick syrup obtained from grapes, figs or dates. This syrup was similar to the date syrup, or “"halek"”, that many Mizrahi Jews continue to use in modern times.
The Biblical references to “honey from the crag” () or “honey from the rock” () could refer either to fig honey, as fig trees commonly grew in rocky outcrops, or to honey collected from wild bees, which made their nests in these places, as they still do in the region until today. The Bible refers to honey from bees in only a few instances, for example, when Samson eats honey from bees made in the carcass of a lion () and when Jonathan eats honey from a honeycomb (), and these references are to honey obtained from the wild.
Nonetheless, the oldest archaeological find relating to beekeeping discovered to date is an apiary dating from about 900 BC at Rehov, a Bronze- and Iron Age site in the Jordan Valley. The hives, made of straw and unbaked clay, could have housed more than a million bees, and indicate that honey was produced on a large scale. It is most likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported the bees from Anatolia because they were less aggressive than the local bees and produced a higher yield of honey. It is also possible that the domestication of bees for honey production was introduced from Egypt during the Iron Age and honey was being obtained from domesticated bees from late in the Iron Age period.
Seasonings.
The most common and important seasoning was salt (), demonstrated by the fact that it is referred to throughout the Bible and its use was mandated with most sacrifices (). Salt was obtained from the Mediterranean or the Dead Sea. It was produced by evaporating seawater from both natural and artificially created drying pans along the Mediterranean coast. It was also obtained by mining salt deposits, such as at Sodom near the Dead Sea. Salt had to be transported to other locations, so most communities had to purchase it.
Food was also flavored by plants, most native to the region and either cultivated or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic and onions, and possibly fenugreek, were used to season cooked foods, as well as being eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin and black cumin, dill, dwarf chicory, hyssop, marjoram, mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron and thyme. Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India, and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.
Another seasoning was vinegar, which was produced by extra fermentation of new wine. It was used for seasoning foods, pickling vegetables, and medicinal purposes.
Storage and preparation of food.
Storing water and food was critical for survival, and particularly, being able to store enough food for use from one harvest to the next. To protect grain from damp and vermin, underground granaries were used for the bulk storage of grain. Families also stored grain, wine and oil in large pottery jars in their houses. When well protected, wheat, barley, legumes and nuts could be kept for long periods. Rainwater from roofs and courtyards was collected in cisterns to supplement natural sources like springs and wells.
Fermentation, oil extraction and drying were all ways of converting food into products that could be stored. Feeding crops to animals was also a means of "storage on the hoof" with the animals converting the fodder into meat or milk.
Food was cooked in pots made of clay and placed on earthenware stands built in a horseshoe shape, so that the fire could be lit through the opening, under the pot, or pots were suspended above the fire from tripods.
Cooked food included soups and stews that were a mixture of meat and vegetables. Beans and lentils were likely to have been cooked several times a week. However, vegetables, such as squash, garlic, leek and onions were also eaten uncooked.
Meals.
Meals eaten by the Israelites fell into two categories: daily meals, and festive or ritual meals.
Daily meals.
Daily meals were prepared by women. Two daily meals were usually eaten by the family, either in the home or in the field. The first meal was eaten in the late-morning, as a break in the workday, and could include roasted grain, olives, figs or some other fruit, bread, dipped in olive oil or vinegar, or eaten with garlic, onions or black radishes for flavor, and water or wine. A description in the Book of Ruth provides an example of this kind of meal: the harvest workers eat bread, dipped in vinegar, and parched or roasted grain (). Agricultural workers, who comprised the largest part of the population, also ate a light meal in the early morning before leaving for their work in the fields ().
The second meal was the main meal of the day and was eaten in the evening. In addition to bread, it typically included soup or a stew of vegetables or legumes, served in a common pot into which everyone dipped their bread. Also served from time to time were cheese and fruits such as fresh figs and melon when in season, as well as dried fruits. Water, wine and milk could also accompany the meal.
Small bowls were used for both eating and drinking. Small jugs contained condiments like olive oil, vinegar and sweetners. Wide-mouthed pitchers held water and milk, while spouted decanters with narrow, ridged necks with built-in strainers held wine.
Festive meals and feasts.
Festive meals were held to mark significant occasions, entertain important guests, or as sacrificial or ritual meals. The meal was prepared by both men and women. Meat was always served at these meals and many people participated so that there would be no leftovers that would go to waste. Ritual feasts and banquets in ancient Israel, and the ancient Near East in general, were important for building social relationships and demonstrating status, transacting business and concluding agreements, enlisting divine help, or showing thanks, devotion or propitiation to a deity, and for conveying social instruction. These meals were imbued with significance by the occasion and were a time for entertainment and enjoyment.
Festive meals were held only from time to time, but they are the ones recorded by biblical and extra-biblical sources. Many biblical stories are set within the context of a meal, such as the accounts of the food Abraham prepares for his visitors (), the stew which Jacob prepares for his father, Isaac, and the Passover meal ().
In the story of Abraham hosting the three visitors, Abraham offers cakes, a well prepared young calf, curds, and milk. This meal has similar elements to an earlier meal described in the story of Sinuhe, an Egyptian nobleman who lived for a time in Canaan around 1900 BCE, at which bread, wine, cooked meat, roast fowl, and dairy products were served.
One of the distinguishing features of the meals of the wealthier social class, as illustrated in the stories of Abraham and Sinuhe, was the more frequent consumption of meat. A description of the provisions for Solomon's kitchen also illustrates this: "Solomon's daily provisions consisted of 30 kor of fine flour and 60 kor of flour, 10 fat oxen, 20 pasture-fed oxen, and 100 sheep and goats, in addition to deer and gazelles, roebucks and fattened geese" (). This account describes the provisions that were possible to obtain for those with the resources to purchase them and indicates they were sufficient to provide sumptuous meals for thousands of people.
Another example of a lavish meal celebrating an important occasion is the inauguration of the Temple by Solomon (, ). Similar meals are described regarding Hezekiah's temple consecration () and Passover celebration ().
In contrast to the simplicity of the daily fare of ordinary people, the cuisine of the royal courts of the ancient Near East was sophisticated, and it is assumed that the dishes served at the table of King Solomon and other Israelite kings were also elaborate. King David had officials who were in charge of wine cellars, olive stores, cattle, olive and fig trees () and the royal kitchen was a complex organization.
The kings of Israel are recorded as having displayed an extraordinary measure of royal hospitality, like other kings of the ancient Near East who held elaborate banquets. Solomon’s royal table is described as providing such a variety of foods that the Queen of Sheba is said to have been amazed that the reports of Solomon’s wealth did not exceed what she had seen (). Royal entertainment in Israel included music (), large numbers of guests (), and presumably many servers and cupbearers, though these are not expressly mentioned in the Bible.
Feasts and banquets were important social and political tools throughout Israel’s history, especially in the early years of the Israelite monarchy, when an invitation to the king’s table was important for creating and maintaining political support and was also an important marker of social status and influence.
Regular meals too, developed as expressions of common identity, social unity and communal celebration. By the Roman period, Jewish communities came together at banquets for both food and company and the weekly Sabbath meal was an occasion for families to gather and enjoy both food and company.
Hospitality.
The practice of hospitality was a fundamental custom of Israelite society and serving food was integral to the hosting of guests. As in other ancient Near Eastern societies, hospitality for guests, both known and strangers, was motivated by the desire to win divine pleasure and reward in an after-life, and more pragmatically, in the expectation that this kindness would be returned when needed. Additionally, in ancient Israel, the belief that God had delivered Israel from slavery resulted in the social imperative and religious commandment to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.
The importance of hospitality to the Israelites can be inferred from the texts of the Bible, in numerous instances, including the stories of Abraham hosting the messengers, Gideon’s call to leadership (), the hospitality of the woman from Zarephath towards the Prophet Elijah () and the Shunammite woman towards Elisha (), David’s hosting of Mephiboshet, son of Jonathan () and Hezekiah’s invitation to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem ().
Meals at which important guests were present were viewed as special occasions, and as such, meat was served. The order in which the guests were served indicated the recognition of the social status of the guest. The choice of meat and dishes indicated the importance of the occasion. The Bible illustrates this in relating how Samuel hosted Saul, who, seated at the head of the hall is served first with a portion of meat that has been especially reserved for him (). Certain parts of the animal, such as the breast and the right thigh, were considered to be the best portions and were reserved for the most honored participants in the meal. Guests were always served before family members. The host would also sit with the guests to encourage them to eat and see to all their needs, as related in the story of Abraham, who waited on his visitors while they ate.
Sacrificial meals.
Sacrificial meals were eaten when a portion of a sacrifice was reserved for the priest ("kohen") or the ordinary Israelite who brought the offering was permitted to eat a portion with his family at a festive meal. The offerings considered “most holy” were eaten by the males of the priests in the court of the Temple sanctuary (). The meal was considered to be a part of the priest’s duties. Other offerings could be eaten by the priests with their families in any ritually clean place (). The ordinary Israelite had to eat his share within a fixed time, with his family, guests, and any Levites and strangers that he invited.
Depending on the type of sacrifice, the animals that were brought as sacrifices could be a lamb, kid, goat, ram, calf, bull or cow; bird offerings were doves and turtledoves (pigeons). Of these, the guilt offering ("asham") () and the communal peace offering ("shalmei tzibur") () were eaten only by the male priests ("kohanim"). Other offerings, such as the Firstborn offering (), could be eaten by the priests and other members of their households, while for the personal peace offering ("shalmei yachid") () and Thanksgiving offering (), the breast and thigh meat were eaten by the priests and other members of their households and the remainder by ordinary Israelites. The Tithe offering () could be eaten by anyone and the Passover offering () was eaten by all who had purchased a share in the sacrifice.
Meal offerings called "mincha" all consisted primarily of flour and were either completely or partially burned on the altar. Those not entirely burned on the altar were eaten by the priests. Some "mincha" offerings were fried or baked before being offered. Types of "mincha" included fine flour ("solet") mixed with oil and of which a portion was given to the kohen; flour mixed with oil and fried on a griddle or on a pan; bread called "challot" mixed with oil and baked in an oven; and wafers ("rekikim") smeared with oil baked in an oven.
There were also baked goods, all made of wheat flour and baked in an oven, which were not burned on the altar. These were the twelve unleavened and specially shaped showbreads, eaten by the priests after they had been displayed; two loaves of leavened bread prepared for the festival of Shavuot and eaten by the priests; thanksgiving breads, which included leavened bread, unleavened bread, unleavened wafers and scalded loaves, with one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the owner and guests; and the unleavened loaves and wafers accompanying the Nazirite’s sacrificial ram, one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the Nazirite and guests.
Whole extended families or clans also participated in a sacrifice that was offered on occasions such as the New Moon, and it is referred to as both the “sacrifice of days” and a kinship sacrifice. In the early Israelite period, before the centralization of sacrificial offerings as an exclusive part of the Temple services, these sacrifices were offered at various locations. David is described as leaving Saul’s table to participate with his family in Bethlehem () and Elkanah goes to Shiloh to participate with his household in the annual sacrifice ().
Perhaps the oldest and most important feast celebrated by the Israelites (and later by Jews) is the Passover. The original feast, with its origins in the story of the Exodus, consisted of a sacrificial lamb, bitter herbs and unleavened bread eaten by each family at home. Under the Israelite monarchy, and with the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, the sacrifice and celebration of Passover became centralized as one of the three pilgrimage festival. Families who were able to travel to Jerusalem ate the Passover meal together in Jerusalem. Those who could not make the pilgrimage celebrated the holiday by holding a special meal and observing the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
Forbidden foods.
In addition to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet was shaped by religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, both in terms of the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that of their neighbors in significant ways. For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with animal blood and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites.
Only animals specifically slaughtered for food or for use in the sacrificial service could be eaten. Detailed lists of which animals, birds and fish could be eaten and which were prohibited appear in the Bible ( and ), and animal bones found in the archaeological record tend to support this, with some exceptions. For the Israelites, food was one way for self-definition. While it is impossible to know to what extent dietary laws were observed, self-definition is a most likely the basis for certain biblical lists listing different kinds of animals permitted or forbidden for consumption. The taboo against eating certain animals, particularly the pig, may have developed from the early Iron Age.
Archaeological evidence from various sites shows that the consumption of pork, while limited, was higher in the early Iron Age but had mostly disappeared during the later Iron Age. Sites in the highlands and the coastal plains show low levels of pig utilization in the early Iron Age, but on the coastal plain, excavations such as Ekron show a higher consumption of pig; this is usually associated with the arrival of the Philistines. However, even at Philistine sites, pig remains were a small proportion of the bones discovered and decline after the initial period of settlement. This may have been due to unsuitable environmental factors for raising pigs. At archaeological excavations at Mount Ebal in Samaria, from the period immediately after the Israelite conquest, animal bones discovered were only from animals considered permissible, such as cattle, sheep, goats and deer.
In addition, some taboos did not relate to the source of the food but to the way in which they were prepared, as in the prohibition against boiling a young goat in its mother’s milk (and mentioned in the Bible in three separate instances: , , ). Milk and its by-products served as offerings in Near Eastern pagan worship to gods and kings and milk was used in connection with the phenomenon of reproduction, and a goat kid would be cooked in its mother's milk. Thus, the Israelite practice was to avoid an act similar to that carried out by the Canaanites as part of their cult worship ().
The Israelites, like other ancient peoples, believed that an animal’s blood carried the soul of the animal and therefore should not be consumed (). The blood of a slaughtered animal was thus drained before the meat was used and the blood itself was not used as a cooking liquid or drink.
There are no biblical lists containing forbidden plants, so it can be assumed any plant or fruit was permissible as food, and their use limited only by taste or toxicity (for example, ) and the fulfillment of religious requirements such as the tithe.

Hap Glaudi

Lloyd Alfred "Hap" Glaudi (November 7, 1912–December 29, 1989) was lead sportscaster for New Orleans CBS affiliate WWL-TV. He was part of a trio of colorful sportscasters that graced the airwaves in New Orleans for the decades beginning in the 1960s extending up until almost 2000. The trio included Glaudi, Wayne Mack of the New Orleans NBC affiliate WDSU-TV, and Buddy Diliberto of then New Orleans ABC affiliate WVUE-TV. All three had distinct personas, fitting of New Orleans's unique culture, with Glaudi being known as the "Dean of New Orleans Sportscasters". Photographs of Hap Glaudi appear at the Radio Theatre of New Orleans website.
Early life and education.
A lifelong resident of New Orleans, Lloyd Alfred Glaudi was born on November 7, 1912. He attended Jesuit High School (New Orleans), giving him his first connection to institutions owned and operated by the Society of Jesus. It was at Jesuit High School that Glaudi earned the moniker "Hap", as he was always happy and that characterization was contracted to "Hap". Fellow broadcaster Ron Brocato reported that Glaudi himself financed his high school education through fortunate winnings at the horse race track. Brocato reported, "He earned his tuition betting on a winning longshot at the Fair Grounds given to him by a bookie.” 
Glaudi continued to higher education at Loyola University of New Orleans, maintaining strong ties to the Society of Jesus. Glaudi commenced his professional journalism career with the now defunct "New Orleans Item" newspaper, one of two major daily afternoon newspapers serving New Orleans at the time. During Glaudi's 25-year tenure with the "Item", Glaudi became feature sportswriter for high school sports in the Greater New Orleans area, endearing him to many locals. Prep sports, together with horse racing, became particular areas of passion for Glaudi as a sports journalist. Healthy competition at the time between Glaudi and New Orleans Times-Picayune sports writer N. Charles Wicker made this a "Golden Age of Prep Sports", according to journalist Brocato's reports.
Television broadcasting career.
Hap Glaudi's transition to broadcast journalism coincided with the rise of local television news, as afternoon daily newspapers declined in circulation. Glaudi became WWL-TV's lead sportscaster in 1964, a tenure that would extend until 1978. It is noteworthy that Jesuit-educated Glaudi would sign on professionally with then Jesuit-owned WWL-TV, true to his Jesuit roots. During this time, WWL-TV emerged as the premier local television news station in New Orleans, with Glaudi as lead sportscaster. As WWL-TV's evening news long remained at the top of the local television ratings, and with Glaudi handling the sports portion of the evening news, the local broadcast community informally dubbed Glaudi the "Dean of New Orleans Sportscasters". With a soft spot for horse racing and prep sports, these remained a focal point of Glaudi's broadcasts, continuing even after the arrival of the New Orleans Saints to the market in 1967. 
He was often teamed with newscasters Garland Robinette and Angela Hill as well as meteorologists Al Duckworth and Nash Roberts, providing a team chemistry with considerable appeal to the New Orleans broadcasting market. A flavor for Hap Glaudi's distinct style is easily seen in WWL-TV's own video report of Glaudi's death on December 29, 1989. He was succeeded on WWL-TV by Jim Henderson. A history of New Orleans television, including Glaudi and the WWL-TV news team of the 60s and 70s has been published.
Other work.
Glaudi added radio to his broadcasting outlets featuring affiliated radio station WWL (AM), which broadcast New Orleans Saints football games. Glaudi provided post-game analysis in the form of a call-in radio show variously named "Hap's Fifth Quarter" or "Hap's Point After", in addition to other broadcasting duties for WWL. Outspoken and passionate though he was about the Saints, Glaudi never took issue with even the most opinionated and overbearing of callers. 
WWL (AM) being a 50,000 watt "clear-channel station", Glaudi's radio broadcasts were heard through much of the United States and even into Ontario, Canada. It was a result of his AM radio broadcasts that Glaudi began to have national exposure.
New Orleans during the 1960s suffered a deep racial divide that extended into prep sports. Publicly prodded by Glaudi, then predominately white Jesuit High School and then predominately African-American St. Augustine High School agreed to play each other in high school basketball in 1965, being the two top New Orleans area prep basketball teams. This event commenced the end of the racial divide in high school sports in the New Orleans area. This event inspired the made-for-television movie "Passing Glory".
Jesuit High School (New Orleans) offers a Lloyd (Hap) Glaudi Scholarship.
Personal life.
Glaudi appeared in a December 19, 1964 episode of CBS-TV's hit show "Gunsmoke", "Aunt Thede," in a bit part as a Townsman. A common practice at the time was for the major networks to select individuals that they perceived as local celebrities to take bit parts in the parent network's popular television shows both to promote their show and their affiliates.
Glaudi lived in New Orleans all of his life, with his wife Millie and three daughters, who maintain close ties to the Greater New Orleans area, until his death of lung cancer at age 77, on December 29, 1989.

Fire Island Air Force Station

Fire Island Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-01) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located west-southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, on Fire Island. It was closed in 1969.
History.
Fire Island AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. Contracts were awarded during the spring of 1950, and work was started shortly afterwards on construction.
During World War II, the three by six mile Fire Island was accessible only by water, and served as a lookout site for United States Army Artillery units for sighting submarines. The station was located 2 miles west of the Anchorage International Airport, in Cook Inlet. All but the northwest corner of Fire Island was reserved. Improvements constructed by the Air Force included 33 buildings and structures utilized for operations, administration, maintenance, communications, a multi-purpose dormitory, radome towers, utilities, and an airstrip, which provided a means of getting personnel and supplies to the island by air.
The station was opened in September 1951, and the 626th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Radars operated were AN/CPS-6B, AN/FPS-8, AN/CPS-4, AN/FPS-20A, and AN/FPS-6B. 
Fire Island AFS also operated as a Manual Control Center (MCC) site. With the creation of NORAD in 1957, Fire Island AFS became one of four NORAD Control Centers in Alaska. Its mission was to feed air defense data to the Alaskan NORAD Region Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, speed, and whether aircraft were friendly or hostile. 
The USAF shared its radars with the United States Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) for Nike missile-defense system (Anchorage Defense Area). 
During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the geography of the island was altered and the airfield on the island was lowered enough to put it under water during high tides, rendering it unusable. Major transportation to and from the station and resupply of perishable items had to be made by helicopter from Elmendorf AFB.
In 1969, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed a reduction in air defense forces. As a result, the Fire Island NORAD control center was deactivated on 30 September 1969. The Army Air-Defense Command Post was moved to King Salmon AFS (F-03).
The station was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after site closure. FAA terminated its use when the Long Range Radar (LRR) station at Kenai (A-14) became operational as a joint-use site in 1980. 
In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated "Operation Clean Sweep", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Today, very little remains of the former Fire Island Air Force Station.

Pleurotus tuber-regium

Pleurotus tuber-regium, the king tuber mushroom, is an edible gilled fungus native to the tropics, including Africa, Asia, and Australasia. It has been shown to be a distinct species incapable of cross-breeding and phylogenetically removed from other species of "Pleurotus".
"P. tuber-regium" is a saprotroph found on dead wood, including "Daniellia" trees in Africa. As the fungus consumes the wood, it produces a sclerotium, or storage tuber, either within the decaying wood or in the underlying soil. These sclerotia are round, dark brown with white interiors, and up to 30 cm wide. The fruiting bodies then emerge from the sclerotium. Both the sclerotium and the fruiting bodies are edible.
In addition to being saprotrophic, "P. tuber-regium" is also nematophagous, catching nematodes by paralyzing them with a toxin.
"P. tuber-regium" has a history of economic importance in Africa as food and as a medicinal mushroom. Industrial cultivation is not yet common, but studies have shown "P. tuber-regium" can be grown on organic wastes such as corn, sawdust, cardboard. Mycelial growth occurs between 15 °C and 40 °C, with an optimum growth rate at 35 °C. A recent study demonstrated that polysaccharides of "P. tuber-regium" are able to delay the progression of diabetes and associated complications in rats with insulin resistance .

Poposauroidea

Poposauroidea is a clade of rauisuchians. It includes poposaurids, shuvosaurids, and ctenosauriscids, but excludes the large predatory quadrupedal rauisuchians such as rauisuchids and prestosuchids. Although it was first formally defined in 2007, the term has been used for many years. The group has been referred to as Poposauridae by some authors, although this name is often used more narrowly to refer to the family that includes "Poposaurus" and its close relatives.
History.
Franz Nopcsa first used the term Poposauridae in 1923 to refer to poposauroids. At this time, the sole member of the group was "Poposaurus", which was considered to be a theropod dinosaur. Over the following years, poposauroids were placed in various groups, including Saurischia, Theropoda, and Carnosauria. This classification existed up until the 1970s, when better remains indicated that "Poposaurus" was a crurotarsan rather than a dinosaur. Other genera such as "Sillosuchus" and "Shuvosaurus" were later erected. Like "Poposaurus", "Shuvosaurus" was originally thought to be a theropod dinosaur.
Sankar Chatterjee reclassified poposauroids as theropod dinosaurs with his description of the new genus "Postosuchus" in 1985. Chaterjee even considered poposauroids to be the ancestors of tyrannosaurs. "Postosuchus" was widely considered to be a poposauroid for the next ten years and was included in many phylogenetic analyses of Triassic archosaurs. In 1995, Robert Long and Phillip A Murry showed that the original material of "Postosuchus" was a chimera (paleontology), or collection of bones from several different animals. According to Long and Murry, Chaterjee's "Postosuchus" material included bones of "Poposaurus" and "Shuvosaurus", giving the impression that it was a poposauroid. "Postosuchus" has since been classified as a rauisuchid, and poposauroids are generally considered not to be theropod dinosaurs.
Poposauroidea was formally defined as a clade by Jonathan C. Weinbaum and Axel Hungerbühler in 2007. In their paper, Weinbaum and Hungerbühler described two new skeletons of "Poposaurus" and incorporated several new characters of the genus into a phylogenetic analysis. Poposauroidea was recovered as a monophyletic grouping, while other rauisuchians (namely Rauisuchidae and Prestosuchidae) were placed as basal forms of a new group called Paracrocodyliformes.
In 2005, paleontologist Paul Sereno defined Poposauridae as a stem-based taxon that includes all taxa more closely related to "Poposaurus gracilis" than to "Crocodylus niloticus", the Nile crocodile. This would encompass not just poposaurids like "Poposaurus" but also many other poposauroids, making it equivalent to Poposauroidea in Weinbaum and Hungerbühler's study.
Brusatte "et al." (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study of archosaurs that resulted in a grouping referred to as Poposauroidea. Unlike many recent studies, they found Rauisuchia to be monophyletic, consisting of two major clades: Rauisuchoidea and Poposauroidea. However, the monophyly of Rauisuchia was not strongly supported in Brutasse "et al."'s analysis. They noted that if their tree was enlarged by one step, Poposauroidea fell outside Rauisuchia to become the sister group of Ornithosuchidae, which is thought to closely related to, but outside, Rauisuchia. In their tree, Poposauroidea included genera usually classified as poposauroids as well as several other genera that are not traditionally placed in the group. One genus, "Yarasuchus", was previously classified as a prestosuchid, but was found to be the most basal poposauroid. "Yarasuchus" is unusual in that it has a relatively long neck and small size. The other genus, "Qianosuchus", is unique among crurotarsans in its semiaquatic lifestyle.
In his massive revision of archosaurs which included a large cladistic analysis, Sterling J. Nesbitt (2011) found "Xilousuchus" to be a poposauroid most closely related to "Arizonasaurus". Nesbitt's analysis did not recover a monophyletic Rauisuchia or monophyletic Rauisuchoidea. Poposauroidea was found to be monophyletic, and more resolved than in previous analyses. The cladogram below follows Nesbitt (2011) with clade names based on previous studies.

Asperity (geotechnical engineering)

In Geotechnical engineering the term asperity is mostly used for unevenness ("roughness") of the surface of a discontinuity, grain, or particle with heights in the range from approximately 0.1 mm to many decimetre. Smaller unevenness is normally considered to be a "material" property (often denoted by "material friction" or "basic material friction").
Dilation.
An often used definition for "asperities" in geotechnical engineering:
Unevenness of a surface are "asperities" if these cause dilation if two blocks with in between a discontinuity with matching "asperities" on the two opposing surfaces (i.e. a "fitting discontinuity") move relative to each other, under low stress levels that do not cause breaking of the "asperities".
Contrast with asperity in materials science.
Materials science recognizes asperities ranging from the sub-visual (normally less than 0.1 mm) to the atomic scale.

Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels

The Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels (formerly The St. Michael's Parish Church), is an Anglican church located on St. Michael's Row, two blocks east of National Heroes Square; at the centre of Bridgetown, Barbados. The Cathedral is the highest of the Anglican (Church of England)'s houses of worship within Barbados.
Originally consecrated in 1665, and then rebuilt in 1789 it was elevated to Cathedral status in 1825 with the appointment of Bishop Coleridge to head the newly created Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands.
The first parish church to be built was the St. Michael's Parish Church, which was located where the St. Mary's Anglican Church now stands. The original St. Michael's Parish Church was a small wooden church constructed between 1660 and 1665. Destroyed by a hurricane in 1780, the church was rebuilt nine years later. The church was later damaged in the great hurricane of 1831 but not destroyed. When the Diocese of Barbados was established, the St. Michael's Parish Church became the St. Michael's Cathedral with Bishop William Hart Coleridge as its first bishop in 1825.
The St. Michael Cathedral is made of coral stone with a beautiful tower and stunning stained glass windows. Inside the church one can see a marble font which dates back to the 1600s, The Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament was added in 1938 and features a roof covered in wallaba heartwood shingles and a Canterbury Cross on the northern wall.
The St. Michael's Cathedral continues to be used as a place of regular worship, though in recent years it has been attempting to raise funds to restore the building.
Graveyard.
In the church's graveyard, one can find the graves of two of Barbados' most outstanding public figures, Sir Grantley Adams, (the first chief minister of Barbados and the first and only Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation), and that of his son, Tom Adams, the island's second Prime Minister.

David Ray Stephens (born January 13, 1962) is an independent songwriter, recording artist and record producer based in Camarillo, CA.
A 1984 graduate of the University of Arizona with a Bachelor of Arts in Percussion Performance, Stephens displayed an early prodigy for the drums and piano before branching out to guitar, bass, electronic keyboards and other instruments during high school. Though Stephens is an exceptional vocalist possessing an extended baritenor range; his original recorded efforts in the early 1980s were tapped mainly to help showcase the vocal talents of his then-girlfriend (later first wife) when her singing came to the notice of a California agent.
After two albums, the pair later divorced without securing a major-label contract.
Stephens then played in several local bands and produced collections of original music, but it is his recent work which is most notable, characterized by a strong MOR rock intuition which includes forays into techno-pop, alternative-grunge and hybrid musical constructions. His 2005 disc "This is What" brings many of these styles together in a cohesive fashion, and his 2010 release "Invisible" resulted in additional notice for his songwriting, vocal prowess, continued musical growth and exceptional musicianship.

State feminism

State feminism is feminism created or approved by the government of a state or nation. It usually specifies a particular program. The government may, at the same time, prohibit non-governmental organizations from advocating for any other feminist program.
Turkey.
In the 20th century, Turkey's government "preempted feminism". The Turkish national government's program in the 1920s included mandatory de-hijabicization (unveiling of women), access for women to more education and work, and political rights for women, all as part of a national effort to emulate some Western cultural characteristics in a Muslim nation.
In the 1980s, second-wave feminism appeared, among daughters of leading women of Turkey's Kemalist movement, the women being feminist within the government's definition and leadership. The state feminism they followed, according to scholar Margot Badran, covered parts of patriarchy with an appearance of Western progressivity.
Yemen.
In South Yemen, also known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (with the subsequent unification of two Yemens into one, the former PDRY is now generally south Yemen), state feminism had little effect on patriarchy and did not have much influence beyond Aden, a port city in the PDRY. "Women in the south ... seemed to believe their gains would never be rescinded. They behaved as feminists, if by that is meant shaping lives of their choice by accessing the new options offered them. But they did not embrace a feminist ideology or identity, as this was preempted by the state. When the socialist regime collapsed, the fragile gains of state feminism went with it." "Northern women had acquired an acute gender consciousness and developed practical feminist skills ... but they had no legitimate political space. Southern women had been able to exploit the educational and professional benefits conferred under state feminism, but they did not have the independent ideological space in which to develop a feminism of their own."
Post-unification Yemen has been analyzed by one author.
Middle East.
In the 1980s and 1990s, "feminist activists and scholars in the Middle East assailed the limits of 'state feminism' and exposed its patriarchal dimensions."
Communist and socialist regimes.
"Sharon Wesoky characterized the relationship of an emergent women's movement to the state as 'symbiotic,' containing elements of both autonomy and dependence, and operating largely within rather than in opposition to party-state institutions."
State feminisms' have been discredited elsewhere as well ["e.g.", in China] following the collapse of communist and socialist regimes."
Criticism.
"Many feminists ... consider the notion of a state feminism to be an oxymoron."
Independent women's movements may be prohibited by the government.

C/2000 U5

C/2000 U5 (LINEAR) is a single-apparition comet discovered on October 29, 2000, by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research. The comet has an observation arc of 362 days allowing a good estimate of the orbit. C/2000 U5 is one of the most hyperbolic comets known and will leave the Solar System.
Before entering the inner Solar System for a 2000 perihelion passage, C/2000 U5 had a barycentric (epoch 1960-Jan-01) orbit with an apoapsis distance of 5,473 AU, and a period of approximately 143,000 years.
The comet came to perihelion on March 13, 2000. As the comet was leaving the inner Solar System, it passed within 0.766 AU of Jupiter on February 3, 2001, which accelerated the comet briefly giving an (epoch 2001-Mar-12) eccentricity of 1.00614. Since an epoch of 2000-Dec-06, C/2000 U5 has had a barycentric eccentricity greater than 1, keeping it on a hyperbolic trajectory that will eject it from the Solar System. In 2029, when it is more than 50 AU from the Sun and beyond the influence of the planets, it will still have a barycentric eccentricity of 1.0057.
Comet C/1980 E1 has an even greater eccentricity.

Serenade No. 4 (Mozart)

The Serenade No. 4 in D major, K. 203/189ba was written on August 1774 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for ceremonies at the University of Salzburg. It is nicknamed Colloredo after Mozart's patrion, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo. The work is very similar to K. 204 serenade composed for Salzburg the following summer.
Structure.
The serenade is scored for two oboes (doubling flutes), bassoon, two horns, two trumpets and strings. There are seven movements:
The March in D, K. 237/189c, was used as an introduction or exit for this work.
The second, third and fourth movements all feature the solo violin prominently, forming a three-movement violin concerto within the serenade. This is similar to the K. 204 serenade from the previous year. These movements are set apart from the rest of the serenade by their choice of keys (B-flat major, F major, B-flat major).
The trio of the second minuet features an independent solo bassoon part.
Like most of his orchestral serenades, a symphony was arranged from a subset of the serenade's movements. The "Serenade Symphony" for this work consists of movements one, six, seven and eight.

The structure lies on both sides of the al Mu'izz li-Din Allah street, with the congregational Mosque-Madrasa built on the western side, and the Khanqah-mausoleum-sabil-kuttab on the eastern side.
History.
Sultan Qansuh Al-Ghuri.
The second last of the Mamluk sultans, Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri was the last Mamluk sultan to enjoy a regin of any duration (1501–16). He was called 'Al-Ghuri' after the barracks Al-Ghuri, where he was garrisoned. He was the governor of Tarsus, then the chamberlain of Aleppo and he was involved heavily in the military campaign against the Ottomans in 1484. Al-Ghuri died of a heart attack while fighting the Ottoman Turks outside Aleppo, following the defection of Amir Khayrbak in the midst of the battle. His body was never found, and was not buried in his mausoleum on which he had spent a fortune. Like other Sultans of his time, Al-Ghuri is portrayed as energetic, cruel, superstitous and despot leader. Harsh punishments were imposed on people during his reign for crimes committed or during money collection. Despite cruelty, Al-Ghuri had a huge fond of music, poetry and flowers and was attracted to Sufis and other pious men. He was a great patron of architecture, and a man of refined cultural tastes. Although the economic conditions was somewhat miserable, the sultan pursued to the very end of his reign a passion for regal pomp, spending considerable funds and confiscating properties to build representative buildings.
The Layout.
The funerary complex has a remarkable layout as a double architectural composition, with two blocks straddling the main street in the heart of medieval Cairo. There are two blocks: the western - consisting of a Mosque with its minaret; the eastern one is a funerary complex, consisting of a mausoleum, a hall called Khanqah, a maq'ad, a graveyard and a sabil-maktab. Both the buildings are built above shops connected to markets stretching along the side street. To provide shade for the street a wooden roof links the buildings. Although the dome and the minaret are separated by the street, they were conceived as a single, harmonious composition and were united by blue ceramic decoration. These blue ceramics is similar to the blue ceramic decoration other the sultan's minaret at Al-Azhar.
The complex was designed to reveal its minaret-and-dome composition to an onlooker coming from the south. Unlike other religious complexes, the facades of the complex are not adjusted to the street alignment. They rather follow the orientation of the two sides of the complex. This creates a square and is semi-enclosed at the north end by the projection of the sabil-kuttan of the mausoleum, and at the south end by the projection of the minaret of the Madrasa. The open space was rented to people to create market stalls. The market economy and the rents helped maintain and upkeep the architecture.
The Mosque.
The facades of the two buildings are not identical, however they have similar features such as the high-relief carving running along their upper walls. The portal recesses have marble paneling in dots of black and white. The columns at the corner of the Mosque have capitals of Coptic and Byzantine styles, indicating that the Mamluk craftsmen were imitating pre-Islamic designs. The huge minaret is visible from near Bab Zuwayla, and is a four storied rectangular tower of a considerable height. This tower had a four-headed upper structure and was the first of its kind to be built in Cairo. The present top with five-headed structure is a modern addition after the collapse of the top in the nineteenth century. The interior is richly paved and paneled with black and white marble. However the stone carving covers the walls but it is of poor quality, shallow and repetitive.
The Khanqah and Mausoleum.
The main facade of the funerary compound is paneled with recesses crowned with a rectangular muqarans crest, including windows of various shapes. The main portal leads to an unusual vestibule with two opposite entrances, the one on the right-hand side leading to the mausoleum and the other to the Khanqah. On the northern edge a sabil-kuttab projects into the street with three facades. The mausoleum on the south side of the interior presently has only its rectangular base and transition zone. The dome, made of brick and covered completely with green tiles, collapsed at the beginning of the century. 
On the left or north side of the entrance resides the Khanqah, though no living units were attached to it. The waqf deed says that Sufis had their meetings there, but there are no living accommodations provided for them. however, there are a few living units attached to the Madrasa across the street. The khanwah is a T shaped hall with a mihrab, decorated like the mausoleum and the Mosque with a polychrome marble dado and pavement. Each of the three mihrabs of the complex has a distinct pattern of marble mosaics. The polychrome marble pavement of the sabil, displaying a dense composition of twenty-pointed geometric stars, is one of the most elaborate in Cairo.

Nominees and winners.
Nominations were announced on 12 January 2012. Categories for this year remain largely unchanged, though the award for "Best International Album" has been discontinued.
Acceptance speech controversy.
Adele and Blur.
Adele was cut short by host Corden during her acceptance speech for the MasterCard British Album of the Year award, causing her to 'give the finger' on national television.
Adele stated that the gesture was aimed at "the suits", not her fans. ITV offered its apologies to the show as an ITV spokesman said "The Brits is a live event. Unfortunately the programme was over-running and we had to move on.
We would like to apologise to Adele for the interruption".
Corden was also upset by the occurrence, stating afterwards "I don't understand what happened but I'm upset about it. Blur get to play for 11 minutes and she gets to say thank you once". Due to the over-running, Blur's set was also cut off, prior to their performance of "Tender".
Emeli Sandé.
There was later more controversy when Emeli Sandé was refused to be allowed to give a speech when she won the Critic's Choice Award. Sandé was said to be distressed by the bosses of the show and also angry after Adele got an apology for being cut off, whereas she did not. During the presentation of the award, Jessie J was asked to give her advice on her career instead of Sandé giving a speech. A friend of Sandé's said to the "Daily Record", "She's had a number-one album with "Our Version of Events" in the UK and they're asking Jessie J what advice she has got for her." An ITV spokesman later gave Sandé apologies and said; "Because there was more music than ever before, everything got pushed back. The public love Emeli. They really support her and think she's fantastic."

Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers' Association of Australasia

Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers' Association of Australasia was an Australian trade union existing from 1908 until 1983. The Association represented workers employed as cooks, bakers, butchers and other food preparation roles aboard ships in Australia and New Zealand.
Amalgamation.
Following a history of co-operation on industrial issues, and the problem of reduced membership due to changes in the industry such as automation, the Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers' Association decided 8 August 1979 to amalgamate with the Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA). The process of amalgamation, including dealing with objections raised by the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, meant that the association still continued to exist, gradually merging with the SUA, until 1984. The amalgamation had a number of advantages, including eliminating demarcation disputes with the SUA, reducing operating costs for the small union, and providing resources to improve training and qualifications. The final vote on amalgamation was passed with a 71% majority of the Marine Cooks' membership in favour of the change.

Ibeku

Ibeku are a clan of the Igbo people of Nigeria. Ibeku is contained in the Umuahia North Local Govt, political division, of Abia state in the eastern part of Nigeria.There are other communities that are around Ibeku such to our south are the clans of Olokoro, Old-Umuahia, Amakama, Ubakala. To the East is Oboro. West are the clans of Umuokpara and Ohuhu. Then North are Uzuakoli and Abiriba. These areas were one time a part of what was called the Bende region in now Abia State.
Ibeku people are a good portion of the igbo speaking people of Nigeria in Igbo language.The associated dialects and origins are explained with this link. Igbo is spoken throughout West Africa in various forms. 
Ibeku people have custodians of these traditional values in each seven clans called Egwu Asaa that make up Ibeku Nation. These seven Clans are Osaa, Amaforo, Ndume, Afaraukwu, Emede, Isieke, Afarata. Each has an Eze that is titled accordingly with a name to reflect that clan. Ibeku clan has a Royal Highness with the title Ogurube Ibeku. The Present Ogurube is His Royal Highness.Eze Samuel Iheonu Onuaha. The Ogurube IV of Ibeku. His cabinet is made up of all the Eze from the seven egwu asaas. These individual egwus are autonomous in terms of organization in localities headed by their own Eze.
History.
Ibeku clan tries to retrace and brings its history to life by various means including culture, tradition, heritage, achieves, acheology and various methods used in organization of its people. The lack and in places paucity of data has tended to encourage unrestrained speculation which in fact largely accounts for some insupportable hypotheses being put forward by many early or pioneer archaeologists, concerning the nature of culture change in Ibeku, Umuahia-Ibeku,eastern Nigeria. One of such flawed hypotheses was that the peopling of the forest region (southern Nigeria and indeed, all of the Guinea zone of West Africa) was a much later development than that of the northern open savanna area. Recent archaeological research has shown that people were already living in south-western Nigeria (specifically Iwo-Eleru) as early as 9000 BC and perhaps earlier at Ugwuelle-Uturu (Okigwe) in south-eastern Nigeria (Shaw and Daniels 1984: 7-100). This is the area of Ibeku clan.
Lack of adequate funding and dating facilities has also caused a lag in archaeological research in ibeku area of Nigeria and indeed, all of West Africa. Many sites threatened by construction work such as bridges, roads, houses and dams are not normally rescued because there are no sources of funding. The governments bothe state and federal have not been supportive enough of archaeological work, partly because both the leaders and the peoples do not recognize the role a sound knowledge of the past can play in nation-building.
There is up to now, no well-equipped dating laboratory either to process charcoal samples or potsherds. The only laboratory in West Africa is in Senegal and it is far from being well equipped. Consequently, it is restricted mostly to processing charcoal samples collected from sites in Senegal. Given this problem, samples collected from archaeological excavations have to be sent abroad for processing. This delays the rate at which archaeological information is put into its proper time perspective.
It seems also that a great deal more time and attention are paid to the later phases of human settlement history than the earlier. Consequently, much more is known of Iron Age and historic settlements in Ibeku as a whole. Some considerable amount of work has been done for these phases in Benin City in Nigeria, Niani in Niger Republic and Jenne-Jeno in Mali, among other places in West Africa. One reason for this interest in the later phase seems to rest in the fact that there is a meeting point between historic settlement archaeology and oral traditions in the region generally and the fact that people can identify much more easily with this phase because it is more recent and by this fact closer to our times.
It is pertinent to note that there is no settlement archaeology tradition(s) in ibeku ibeku Nigeria up to the early 1980s. Even at places like Ife, Old-Oyo, Benin and Zaria where some relatively limited archaeological work has been carried out, efforts were mainly concentrated on walls (Soper 1981: 61-81; Darling 1984: 498-504; Leggett 1969: 27). In Southern Nigeria, where Ibeku is located, proto-historic settlements were generally composed of mud or sun-dried brick houses. Most if not all these house structures and defensive and/or demarcatory walls have either been destroyed or obliterated by erosion. The tradition(s) of constructing houses with stones in the pre colonial past was well reflected in many parts of Northern Nigeria. In fact, many hill-top settlements in this area of Nigeria were composed of stone houses - a direct response among other things, to opportunities offered by the immediate environment (Netting 1968: 18-28; Denyer 1978: 41-47). Despite the nature of the soil chemistry (acidic soil) stone buildings are still better preserved than mud houses.
Relics of ancient settlements are much fewer in the south, including ibeku, than in the north, because of the different building materials as well as techniques of construction which are partly determined by diverse historical experiences among other things. Hill-tops and slopes offer abundant boulders which could be dressed for construction, while in the plains, it is much easier to obtain mud for building houses. For example, the dispersed mode of settlement of the present-day Tiv as opposed to the nucleated rural settlements on the hill-tops and slopes in ancient times, coupled with their shifting agricultural system, as well as the factor of refarming and/or resettlement of former sites by some daughter groups which hived off, from the original stock, make most ancient settlements and recently abandoned sites (made up of sun-dried brick houses) difficult to discover at least in a fairly well preserved state (Sokpo and Mbakighir 1990, Personal Communication).
This preservation problem among others further make the task of establishing stratigraphic sequences a little bit difficult. Nigeria is divisible into zones on the basis of techniques of construction as follows:
[1.] Mud construction techniques which are very common in most parts of southern Nigeria and in Ibeku.
[2.] Stone construction techniques which are very common in most parts of Northern Nigeria; and
Combination of mud and stone construction techniques. This development is common in Tivland, where the ancient houses and protective walls on hill-tops were constructed of stones, while present-day houses in the plains are usually constructed of mud.
Given our experiences in Ibeku ibeku Nigeria, the third category of construction is very useful for generating models. These are models derivable from oral traditional data and ethnographic resources. Such models, if carefully applied to archaeological situations, can greatly fill the gaps in our knowledge of the past of the Ibeku peoples.

"For the band formed in 2006 with the same name, see Fields (band)"
Fields was a progressive rock band formed in 1971 by Andrew McCulloch and Graham Field, and also containing Alan Barry. McCulloch had previously been a member of King Crimson, but left due to musical differences. Field had founded Rare Bird, and Barry was a member of the Giles Brothers.
They only recorded one eponymous album in 1971, and one single from the album, "A Friend of Mine", in 1973. According to Field, CBS management changed and "the new faces did not want to know us", so the group disbanded. Field had the rights to the name Rare Bird, and returned to working in that area and in television themes. McCulloch went on to become a founder member of Greenslade.

Paradise Historic District

The Paradise Historic District comprises the historic portion of Paradise developed area of Mount Rainier National Park. The subalpine district surrounds its primary structure, the Paradise Inn, a rustic-style hotel built in 1917 to accommodate visitors to the park. The Paradise Inn is a National Historic Landmark. Five other buildings are included in the district. The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1991. It is part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District, which encompasses the entire park and which recognizes the park's inventory of Park Service-designed rustic architecture.
District.
The Paradise area had been burned by an 1885 forest fire that left a great deal of standing timber in a "silver forest", primarily Alaska Cedar. Much of this timber was harvested to build park structures, particularly the Paradise Inn. The area's chief attractions are the wildflower meadows above the built-up area. The development of the area was undertaken by the Rainier National Park Company, which built the Paradise Inn in 1917 and added the annex in 1920, as well as the Guide House the same year. Three other buildings were built by the National Park Service. 
The Paradise area formerly included a group of 215 frame cabins built in 1930, served by the Paradise Lodge of 1931, which were open year-round. The cabins were sold in 1942 to be used to house defense workers As part of the Mission 66 program, the Paradise area was proposed as a day-use area, with the Inn to be demolished. Public pressure resulted in the preservation of the Inn and its renovation. The Paradise Lodge was intentionally burned on June 3, 1965 to make room for parking for the new Paradise Visitor Center.
Buildings.
The 1917 Paradise Inn is a large hotel with a prominent dormered roof, built in an "alpine" variant of the National Park Service Rustic style. The inn's interior features exposed log structure, with a high lobby housing handcrafted log furniture. Fourteen doors open off the lobby to the northeast, flanked by log buttresses that follow the slope of the roof to the ground, carrying the local snow loads. The Inn was designed by Heath, Grove and Bell, of Tacoma. Twenty-eight guest rooms were in an attached wing above the dining room, with a further wing housing suites and rooms.
The Paradise Inn Annex was built in 1920, slightly downhill from and parallel to the main inn's lobby. The 3-1/2 story timber frame building is connected to the main Inn by a multi-story bridge. Designed by Seattle architect Harlan Thomas, the version finally constructed was scaled down from the originally-proposed structure, which was to be long with a central stone pavilion and exposed log framing. The portion that was built was to have been the south wing, and construction was simplified to plain framed construction, measuring by . 
The Guide Service Building is a 3-1/2 story timber frame structure opposite the Paradise Inn. It was built by the Rainier National Park Company in 1920 features a distinctive gambrel roof to house mountain climbing guides. The basement contains a small auditorium and stage, while the ground floor houses offices. The upper levels are dormitory spaces. 
The Paradise Ranger Station is a small 1-1/2 story building with a steeply-pitched cedar shingle roof. The ranger station was completed in 1922 to a design by the National Park Service Landscape Engineering Division. The roof, supported on rubblestone walls, was designed to shed the heavy winter snowfall typical of the Paradise area. A system of cables anchored to the hillside resists the downhill pressure of the snow load.
The Paradise Comfort Station is a public toilet facility. It was built in 1928 to a design by the Park Service Western Region Branch of Plans and Designs, supervised by Thomas Chalmers Vint. In contrast to the ranger station, the comfort station features a strongly built low-pitched roof built in reinforced concrete. The walls were clad in stone veneer. The roof was designed to resist a snow load weighing 35 pounds per cubic foot, for a 1225-pound-per-square-foot loading. 
The Paradise Ski-Tow Powerhouse was built to house a portable ski-tow system. Paradise was a significant skiing venue during the 1930s, but the Park Service did not permit a permanent ski lift facility. The ski-tow house was built in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps with a steeply pitched roof similar to that of the ranger station.

Charles Thurstan Shaw

Charles Thurstan Shaw CBE FBA FSA (27 June 1914 - 8 March 2013) was an English archaeologist, the first trained specialist to work in what was then British West Africa. He specialized in the ancient cultures of present-day Ghana and Nigeria. He helped establish academic institutions including the Ghana National Museum and the archaeology department at the University of Ghana. He began working with the University of Ibadan in 1960, where he later founded and developed its archeology department, which he led for more than 10 years before his retirement in 1974. 
His excavations at Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria revealed a 9th-century indigenous culture that did highly sophisticated work in bronze metalworking, centuries before other sites that were better known at the time of discovery, and independent of any Arab or European influence. He was awarded the C.B.E. in 1972 for his contributions, and in 1989 was made a tribal chief in Nigeria.
In addition, Shaw worked on expanding communications about African archaeology; in 1964, he founded the "West African Archaeological Newsletter," which he edited until 1970; from 1971-1975, he edited the "West African Journal of Archaeology."
Early life and education.
Born in Plymouth, England, the second son of Reverend John Herbert Shaw, an Anglican priest, and Grace Irene Woollatt, Thurstan Shaw was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton. He studied Classics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University, where he added Archeology. He received a B.A (1st class) in 1936 and was awarded an M.A. in 1941.
Academic career.
Shaw was encouraged by Louis Leakey to go to the Gold Coast (later Ghana) to work in archaeology, arriving on 15 September 1937. He started as a tutor and was appointed Curator of the Anthropology Museum at Achimota College, holding that post until 1945. During this time he made the first archaeological excavations in Ghana at Dawu near Accra. He served with the Cambridge Education Committee before becoming a tutor for the Cambridge Institute of Education 1951–1964.
During the 1950s, Shaw helped found and organize the collections of the Ghana National Museum and establish the archaeology department at the University of Ghana. These were part of the national institutions being developed as Ghana moved toward revived independence, and served to study and preserve its rich heritage within its own borders.
In 1959, Shaw was invited by the antiquities department of Nigeria to perform an excavation at Igbo-Ukwu, where numerous ancient bronzes had been found by a villager. Shaw's excavation revealed bronze pieces that were evidence of a sophisticated Igbo civilization from the ninth century, marking the most-developed metalworking culture of the time. They were working centuries before the development of other bronze-working sites in what is now Nigeria.
Shaw returned to the town in 1964 and conducted two more excavations, which also revealed extensive bronzes, as well as thousands of trade beads demonstrating a network extending to Egypt. He also found evidence of ritual practices related to burials and sacred sites.
In 1960 Shaw joined the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, where he in 1963 became Research Professor of Archaeology and established the department, training talented archeologists, and leading it until his retirement in 1974. Based on an assessment of his published work, he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1968 from Cambridge.
From 1964–1970, Shaw was founder and editor of the "West African Archaeological Newsletter". He edited the "West African Journal of Archaeology", 1971–1975. He writes under the name Thurstan Shaw and the pen name of Peter Woods.
He returned to England from Africa in 1976 when appointed Director of Studies in Archaeology and Anthropology at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he served until 1979.
Personal life.
In 1939 he married Ione Magor, and they had two sons and three daughters together. She died in 1992. In 2004 he married Pamela Smith, a historian of archaeology.
Shaw was a pacifist, and in 1960 became an active and widely respected Quaker. He participated in anti-war activities. At the World Archeology Conference in 1986, he took part in a boycott against South African academics as an anti-apartheid measure.
After returning to England, Shaw was active in walking groups. He founded the Icknield Way Association to reopen and restore the prehistoric path from Norfolk to Wiltshire.
A brief, affectionate and informative account, with photograph, of Shaw as an undergraduate appears in the June 1936 issue of the Sidney Sussex magazine, "The Pheon."

Sportavia-Pützer RS 180 Sportsman

__NOTOC__
The Sportavia-Pützer RS-180 Sportsman is a four-seat sport aircraft that was produced in Germany in the late 1970s.
The aircraft is a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tricycle undercarriage. The pilot and passengers are seated in 2+2 configuration under a large bubble canopy. The structure is of wood, covered in plywood and given an outer skin of fibreglass.
Design and development.
Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB) was founded in 1956. In 1976 it acquired the assets of Sportavia-Pützer, which had been formed in 1966 to take over from Alpavia SA the production of several light aircraft types designed by René Fournier. Sportavia-Pützer produced Fournier aircraft beginning in 1966, and in 1970 Fournier initiated the design of a new four-seat cabin monoplane, the "Sportsman". The first prototype Sportsman first flew on 1 March 1973, but the second prototype, which made its maiden flight on 28 April 1976, was a completely redesigned version which was created by Sportavia. This redesigned model was designated the RF-6C Sportsman when it entered production in late 1976, and was re-named RS-180 Sportsman when a new empennage design was added in early 1978, following the fatal crash of the prototype in May 1977. The extensive redesign included reshaping the horizontal tail and relocating it part-way up the fin, changing the wing profile, and removing the turned-down wingtips of the RF-6C. In this form, the RS-180 gained German type certification in 1978.
Basic structure of the Sportsman is wood, with a low-wing cantilever monoplane configuration. The surface is covered with fibreglass. A fixed nosewheel undercarriage with wheel fairings is used. The cabin employs a large bubble canopy.
At the end of 1980, Sportavia-Pützer was integrated into the RFB organisation, the RS-180 being re-designated FRB RS-180 Sportsman. Production was halted in early 1981, after fewer than two dozen units had been completed.

Oleo strut

An oleo strut is an air–oil hydraulic shock absorber used on the landing gear of most large aircraft and many smaller ones. It cushions the impacts of landing and while taxiing and damps out vertical oscillations.
Operation.
An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air – especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. 
When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. It compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod may be used to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, and a check valve may be used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound.
Nitrogen is usually used as the gas instead of air, since it is less likely to cause corrosion. The various parts of the strut are sealed with O-rings or similar elastomeric seals, and a scraper ring is used to keep dust and grit adhering to the piston from entering the strut.

King Salmon Air Force Station

King Salmon Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-03, LRR ID: A-07) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located west of King Salmon, Alaska. 
The control center station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the Air and Space Operations Center, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska.
History.
King Salmon AFS was a continental defense radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. The Air Force awarded a contract to construct the radar site to Gaasland & Company on 12 April 1950. Construction began shortly afterward and was completed the following year at a cost of approximately $3,667,372. 
King Salmon became operational as a ground controlled intercept (GCI) site in November 1951 and initially the station functioned as a GCI and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Radars operated were am AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20A, AN/FPS-6, AN/CPS-5 (Bkup), and an AN/FPS-6B.
It converted to an Air Defense Direction Center (later renamed NORAD Control Center) on 4 March 1953, and exercised control over Cape Newenham AFS and Cape Romanzof AFS. Control of the other aircraft control and warning sites in the southern sector was transferred to King Salmon when the Fire Island AFS NORAD Control Center was closed in July 1969.
Initially, King Salmon AFS was maintained and operated by Detachment F-3, 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (AC&W Gp). In 1952, Alaskan Air Command (ACC) decided to upgrade all the aircraft control and warning detachments to squadrons. The 705th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated on 8 December 1952 and assigned to the 531st AC&W Gp. Following the Group's inactivation on 13 April 1953, the squadron was assigned to various other headquarters, including AAC. On 15 November 1977, the squadron was reassigned to the 531st AC&W Gp when the latter was reactivated at Elmendorf AFB. The Group was redesignated the 11th Tactical Control Group on 1 July 1981.
Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. AAC, after investigating various options, decided to build the RCA Corporation's White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The AFCS's 1930 Comm Sq., Det. 2 operated and maintained the facility's communications including teletype, crypto, radar tracking, and the Ground Radio and Aircraft Radio at the site as well as the MARS (Military Affiliate Radio Service). Friendly, Foe, and Unidentified aircraft vector displays were projected on the over all map of Alaska in the Operations Room.
The King Salmon site was activated on 25 May 1957. It was inactivated on 3 August 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm.
On 1 October 1977, AAC, after a trial period, implemented a base support contract with RCA Services as part of an Air Force-wide effort to reduce remote tours. Twenty-eight positions were eliminated. The remaining 63 positions were primarily in operations.
King Salmon was the first radar site to receive a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under AAC's Seek Igloo program. The unit, a prototype version, was tested at King Salmon in September 1982, then placed in 24-hour operation in December. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC), which reached initial operational capability on l5 June 1983. No longer needed, the 705 ACWS was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the King Salmon LRR Site was transferred to Pacific Air Forces' (PACAF) Eleventh Air Force with the redesignation of AAC. 
In 1998 PACAF initiated "Operation Clean Sweep", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar and support station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and remediation work was completed by 2005.
Current status.
Today, very little remains of the former King Salmon Air Force Station. The site is controlled by PACAF's 611th Air & Space Operations Center, based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The site is generally unattended. Because of its proximity to King Salmon Airport , only two civilian contractor maintenance and support personnel are needed to maintain the radar system.

Churn and burn

Churn and burn refers to a tactic used by large anti-union businesses with high turnover in order to bust an already-existent union in a given workplace. "Churning" refers to the management practice of filtering new workers based on their support of unionism. In a large business with poorly paid, entry-level workers with a high rate of turnover, support for a union can be gradually reduced by making sure during the hiring process that only anti-union workers are hired. Eventually, support drops low enough to "burn" the union through decertification.

Fukushima Dai-ichi ("dai-ichi" means "#1"), was a multi-reactor nuclear power site in the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred after a 9.0 magnitude Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami on 11 March 2011, only 14 days before the reactor was to be shut down. This offshore earthquake, near the island of Honshu, produced a large tsunami in Japan, and a tsunami warning for over 20 countries within and around the Pacific Rim.
The earthquake triggered a scram shut down of the three active reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Fukushima Dai-Ichi). The ensuing tsunami crippled the site, stopped the Fukushima I backup diesel generators, and caused a station blackout. The subsequent lack of cooling led to explosions and meltdowns at the Fukushima I facility, with problems at three of the six reactors and in one of the six spent fuel pools.

March.
Monday, 7 March.
Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) submits a report to Japan's nuclear safety agency which predicts the possibility of a tsunami up to 10.2 metres high at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in the event of an earthquake similar to the magnitude 7.2 earthquake with accompanying tsunami that devastated the area in 1896. TEPCO actually made this prediction in 2008 but delayed in submitting the report because they ""did not feel the need to take prompt action on the estimates"".
Friday, 11 March.
According to a report in the "New York Times", "... at the start of the crisis Friday, immediately after the shattering earthquake, Fukushima plant officials focused their attention on a damaged storage pool for spent nuclear fuel at the No. 2 reactor at Daiichi, said a nuclear executive who requested anonymity ... The damage prompted the plant’s management to divert much of the attention and pumping capacity to that pool, the executive added. The shutdown of the other reactors then proceeded badly, and problems began to cascade."
Saturday, 12 March.
To release pressure within reactor unit 1 at Fukushima I, steam is released out of the unit into the air. This steam contains water vapor, hydrogen, oxygen and some radioactive material, mostly tritium and nitrogen-16.
TEPCO engineers decided to directly inject sea water inside the pressure vessel of the reactors by means of the mobile trucks of the firemen. The pressure relief was also necessary to allow the firemen to inject seawater into the reactors vessels.
Sunday, 13 March.
A partial meltdown was reported to be possible at unit 3. At 13:00 JST reactors 1 and 3 are vented to release overpressure and then re-filled with water and boric acid for cooling, and to inhibit further nuclear reactions. Unit 2 was possibly suffering a lower than normal water level, but was thought to be stable; although pressure inside the containment vessel was high. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced that it was rating the situation at unit 1 as level 4 (an accident with local consequences) on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.
Monday, 14 March.
The president of the French nuclear safety authority, Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (ASN), said that the accident should be rated as a 5 (an accident with wider consequences) or even a 6 (a serious accident) on INES.
Tuesday, 15 March.
Damage to the temporary cooling systems on unit 2 from the explosion in unit 3, plus problems with its venting system, meant that water could not be added to the extent that unit 2 was in the most severe condition of the three reactors. An explosion in the "pressure suppression room" causes some damage to unit 2’s containment system. A fire breaks out at unit 4. Radiation levels at the plant rise significantly but subsequently fall. Radiation equivalent dose rates of 400 millisieverts per hour (400 mSv/h) are observed at one location in the vicinity of unit 3.
Wednesday, 16 March.
At approximately 14:30 TEPCO announces its belief that the fuel rod storage pool of unit 4 – which is located outside the containment area — may have begun boiling, raising the possibility that exposed rods could reach criticality. By midday NHK TV is reporting white smoke rising from the Fukushima I plant, which officials suggest is likely coming from reactor 3. Shortly afterwards all but a small group of remaining workers at the plant are placed on standby because of the radiation rising to a dangerous level of up to 1 Sv/h. TEPCO temporarily suspended operations at the facility. A TEPCO press release states that workers had been withdrawn at 06:00 JST because of abnormal noises coming from one of the reactor pressure suppression chambers. Late in the evening Reuters reports that water is being poured into reactors 5 and 6.
Thursday, 17 March.
During the morning Self-Defense Force helicopters drop water four times on the spent fuel pools of units 3 and 4. They measure radiation field of 3.75 Sv/h above Unit 3. In the afternoon it is reported that the unit 4 spent fuel pool was filled with water and none of the fuel rods were exposed. Construction work is started to supply a working external electrical power source to all six units of Fukushima I. Starting at 7 pm, police and fire water trucks attempt to spray water into the unit 3 reactor with high pressure hoses. Japanese authorities inform the IAEA that engineers are laying an external grid power line cable to unit 2. After watching the helicopter effort on TV Kazunori Hasegawa, president of Chuo Construction, calls the government and offers the use of his two truck-mounted concrete boom pumps to spray water directly into the reactors. TEPCO did not respond for three days, and then stated it would wait for the arrival of similar pumps obtained elsewhere.
Friday, 18 March.
Tokyo Fire Department dispatches thirty fire engines with 139 fire-fighters and a trained rescue team at approximately 03:00 JST, including a fire truck with a 22-metre water tower. For the second consecutive day, high radiation levels are detected in an area northwest of the damaged Fukushima I nuclear plant at 150 μSv/h. Japanese authorities upgrade INES ratings for cooling loss and core damage at unit 1 to level 5, and issue the same rating for units 2 and 3. The loss of fuel pool cooling water at unit 4 is classified as a level 3. In a 24-hour period ending at 11 am local time, radiation levels near the plant decline from 351.4 to 265 μSv/h, but it is unclear if the water spraying efforts were the cause of the decrease.
Saturday, 19 March.
A second group of 100 Tokyo and 53 Osaka firefighters replaces the previous team. They use a vehicle that projects water from a height of 22 meters to cool spent nuclear fuel in the storage pool inside the reactor of unit 3. Water is sprayed into the reactor for a total of 7 hours during the day. TEPCO reports that the water was effective in lowering the temperature around the spent fuel rods to below 100 °C.
Sunday, 20 March.
External power is reconnected to unit 2, but work continues to make the equipment operational. Repaired diesel generators at unit 6 provide power to restart the cooling on units 5 and 6, both of which are returned to cold shutdown and their fuel cooling ponds returned to normal operating temperatures. TEPCO announces that the pressure in reactor 3's containment vessel is rising, and that it might be necessary to vent air containing radioactive particles to relieve pressure, as reported by Japanese broadcaster NHK at 1:06. The operation is later aborted as TEPCO deems it unnecessary. While joining in a generally positive assessment of progress toward overall control, Japanese chief cabinet secretary Edano confirms, for the first time, that the heavily damaged and contaminated complex will be closed once the crisis is over.
Monday, 21 March.
Ongoing repair work is interrupted by a recurrence of grey smoke from the south-east side of unit 3 (the general area of the spent fuel pool) seen at 15:55 and is dying down by 17:55. Employees are evacuated from unit 3, but no changes in radiation measurements or reactor status are seen. No work was going on at the time (such as restoring power) which might have accounted for the fire. White smoke, probably steam, is also seen coming from unit 2 at 18:22 JST, accompanied by a temporary rise in radiation levels. A new power line is laid to unit 4 and unit 5 is transferred to its own external power from a transmission line instead of sharing the unit 6 diesel generators.
Officials learn that the crisis will not end with power recovery as the cooling pumps are damaged beyond repair and must be replaced. An emergency order was placed for new pumps for unit 2 which had suffered less damage than units 1 and 3.
Tuesday, 22 March.
Smoke is still rising from units 2 and 3, but is less visible, and is theorized to be steam following operations to spray water onto the buildings. Repair work resumes, after having been halted because of concerns over the smoke; it is felt safe because no significant changes in radiation levels have occurred. Work continues to restore electricity, and a supply cable is connected to unit 4. Injection of seawater into units 1–3 continues. External power cables are reported to be connected to all six units and lighting is back on again in the control room of unit 3.
Wednesday, 23 March.
Smoke again starts belching from reactor 3 in the late afternoon, this time black and grey smoke, causing another evacuation of workers from around the area. Aerial video from the plant shows what appears to be a small fire at the base of the smoke plumes in the heavily damaged reactor building. Feed water systems in unit 1 are restored allowing an increase in the rate water that can be added to the reactor. The Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary also advises that high levels of radioactivity have been found in Tokyo's drinking water and that it should not be used to reconstitute baby formula as it is around twice the legal limit for children.
Thursday, 24 March.
Seawater injection to units 1, 2 and 3 continues, and radiation levels near the plant decline to 200 μSv/h, while lighting is restored to the unit 1 control room. Three workers are exposed to high levels of radiation which cause two of them to require hospital treatment, after radioactive water seeps through their protective clothes. The workers are exposed to an estimated equivalent dose of 2–6 Sv to the skin below their ankles. They were not wearing protective boots, as their employing firm's safety manuals "did not assume a scenario in which its employees would carry out work standing in water at a nuclear power plant". The activity concentration of the water is about 3.9 GBq/L. Infra-red surveys of the reactor buildings, obtained by helicopter, show that the temperatures of units 1, 2, 3 and 4 continue to decrease, ranging from 11–17 °C, and the fuel pool at unit 3 is recorded at 30 °C.
Friday, 25 March.
NISA announces a possible breach in the containment vessel of the unit 3 reactor, though radioactive water in the basement might alternatively have come from the fuel storage pool. Highly radioactive water is also found in the turbine buildings of units 1 and 2. The US Navy sends a barge with of fresh water, expected to arrive after two days. Japan announces transportation will be provided in a voluntary evacuation zone of . Tap water is reported to be safe for infants in Tokyo and Chiba by Japanese authorities, but still exceeds limits in Hitachi and Tokaimura. Iodine-131 in the ocean near the plant measures 50,000 Bq/L, 1,250 times normal levels.
Saturday, 26 March.
Fresh water becomes available again for use instead of seawater to top up reactor water levels. The fresh water is provided by two United States Navy barges holding a total of 2,280 metric tons of fresh water which were towed by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force from the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka Naval Base to Fukushima. Radiation levels near the plant decline to a still relatively high 170 μSv/h.
Sunday, 27 March.
Levels of "over 1000" and 750 mSv/h are reported from water within unit 2 (but outside the containment structure) and 3 respectively. A statement that this level in unit 2 is "ten million times the normal level" were later retracted and attributed to incorrectly high levels of iodine-134 (which is later reported to be below the limit by TEPCO). Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency indicate that "The level of radiation is greater than 1,000 millisieverts. It is certain that it comes from atomic fission ... But we are not sure how it came from the reactor." The high radiation levels cause delays for technicians working to restore the water cooling systems for the troubled reactors. USAF technicians at Yokota AB complete the fabrication of compatibility valves to allow the connection of deployed pump systems to the existing infrastructure at Fukushima. An aerial video recorded by a Ground Self-Defense Force helicopter reveals, according to NHK, the clearest and most detailed view of the damaged plant to date. Significant observations include:
Monday, 28 March.
The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission states that it "assumed" melted fuel rods in unit 2 have released radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To reduce the amount of leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the cooling pumps and other powered systems to reactors 1–4. TEPCO confirms finding low levels of plutonium in five samples during 21 and 22 March. Enriched levels of Plutonium-238, relative to Plutonium-239 and Plutonium-240, at two of the sites in the plant (solid waste area and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the "recent incident". Nonetheless, the overall levels of plutonium for all samples are about the same as background Pu levels resulting from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing in the past. However, these weapons did not use fuel that has decayed significantly. Such nuclear accidents as this one are a potent source of biologically accumulating isotopes of transuranic elements such as curium and americium which are incorporated into bones, complexed into the Ca/PO4 hydroxide.
Tuesday, 29 March.
TEPCO continues to spray water into reactors 1–3 and discovers that radioactive runoff water is beginning to fill utility trenches outside the three reactor buildings. The highly radioactive water in and around the reactor buildings continues to limit progress of the technicians in restoring the cooling and other automated systems to the reactors.
Wednesday, 30 March.
At a news conference TEPCO Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata announces that it is unclear how the problems at the plant will be resolved. An immediate difficulty is the removal of large quantities of radioactive water in the basement buildings, but also salt build up inside the reactors, from using seawater for cooling, will need to be removed. Building concrete walls to enclose the reactors in a shield is being considered, as had been done at Chernobyl. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds radioactive iodine in milk in the United States.
Thursday, 31 March.
Workers pump radioactive water from a utility trench near reactor 1 into a storage tank near reactor 4. Water in the condensers for reactors 2 and 3 is shifted to outside storage tanks so that the condensers can remove more contaminated water from inside the reactors. The world's largest concrete pumping truck is shipped from the United States to Fukushima. The truck has been slightly modified to be able to pump cooling water initially, then will later possibly to be used to pump concrete for any eventual permanent containment structure. A 62-metre-tall pumping truck, donated by Chinese manufacturer SANY is also used.
April.
Friday, 1 April.
TEPCO says that groundwater near unit 1 contains radioiodine at levels 10,000 times normal, but NISA later disputes the numbers. The Japanese government is reported to be considering injecting nitrogen into the reactor vessels. Two more concrete pumping trucks, used initially to pump cooling water, are shipped to Japan from the Putzmeister factory in Germany.
Saturday, 2 April.
TEPCO observes for the first time that contaminated water from the unit 2 is flowing into the sea. Workers discover a crack about 20 cm (8 inches) wide in the maintenance pit, which lies between the reactor 2 and the sea, and holds cables used to power seawater pumps. Workers were preparing to pour concrete into the crack to stop the water, which was emitting radiation at 1 Sv/h.
Sunday, 3 April.
The attempt to plug the leak near unit 2 fails when the concrete fails to set. TEPCO then reattempts to plug up the trench that leads to the damaged storage pit with a combination of superabsorbent polymer, sawdust and shredded newspaper, which also fails. Radioactive water continues to leak into the sea. Radiation levels around the plant are estimated at 1 Sv/h and continue to decrease.
TEPCO confirms the first deaths at the Fukushima facility, two workers who had been missing since 11 March and appear to have died in the basement of reactor 4 from bleeding due to multiple injuries inflicted by the tsunami.
Japanese government officials say the Daiichi plant may continue to release dangerous radiation into the air for several months.
Monday, 4 April.
TEPCO begins dumping water from storage tanks tainted with low levels of radioactivity into the Pacific Ocean on Monday night. Officials say this is needed to make room in a central waste facility to store water with a higher radioactive level. This more highly radioactive water is preventing workers from making progress on restoring the cooling and other systems to reactors 1–4. Samples of seawater near the plant reveal radioactive caesium at 1.1 million times the legal limit.
The company says it could release up to 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the sea. A spokeswoman for Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says the less-contaminated water must be disposed of so that workers can secure a place to store more highly contaminated water on the site.
Engineers consider plans to inject inert nitrogen gas into the containment buildings of units 1, 2 and 3 to expel atmospheric oxygen and to dilute accumulated hydrogen, which combine explosively.
Tuesday, 5 April.
It is determined that the leak into the cable storage pit from unit 2 was likely due to a faulty joint where the pit meets a duct. The pit leads to a gravel layer beneath, resulting in highly radioactive water pouring directly into the sea.
Levels of radioactive iodine-131 in seawater near the facility are found to be 7.5 million times the legal limit. TEPCO drills a hole into the pit near reactor 2, from which highly radioactive water is leaking, and inject water glass (sodium silicate) into the pit to prevent further leaking.
Wednesday, 6 April.
TEPCO announces that an injection of of polymer coagulant into the pit mitigated the leaking; however, the IAEA and others credit additional factors. Sodium silicate ("water glass") and additives are injected into the ground in order to stop the leakage of radioactive water. The residual heat carried by the water used for cooling the damaged reactors accelerates the setting of the injected mixture.
Despite protests from the South Korean government, Russian scientists, and Japanese fishermen, Japan authorizes the release of of less radioactive water into the ocean to make room to store the more highly contaminated water.
Iodine-131 levels reach 7.5 million times the legal limit in a seawater sample taken near the facility.
TEPCO announces that the leak of highly radioactive water from the utility pit near reactor 2 has stopped. According to U.S. Representative Ed Markey, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says that the core of unit 2 has become so hot that part of it has melted through the reactor pressure vessel; however, a NRC spokesperson says, "That's not clear to us, nor is it clear to us that the reactor has penetrated the vessel." TEPCO begins injection of nitrogen into unit 1 to lower the possibility of hydrogen explosions.
Thursday, 7 April.
Nitrogen injection into the pressure containment vessel of unit 1 commences at 01:31.
Workers are evacuated following a magnitude 7.1 aftershock off the north-eastern coast of Japan, 118 kilometers from the plant. TEPCO reports communications and power were not affected and no additional damage was observed as a result. A tsunami warning is also issued, but is lifted after 90 minutes. Most of the workers at the nuclear plant were evacuated.
Official measures at Fukushima I reactor unit 1, however, show a rise in temperature following the aftershock and a spiking amount of radiation in the Dry Well, which exceeds the instrument maximum of 100 Sv/h. Gauge B, in the meantime, records a steady increase in pressure for the previous ten days in the same reactor.
Reporting the rise to 100 Sv/h from the earlier 30 Sv/h, TEPCO declares that the "validity of the measurement is questioned" both for radiation levels and pressure.
Friday, 8 April.
Before the crisis evaluation was elevated by Japanese authorities to level 7, the highest level, experts already recognized that Fukushima is the most complicated nuclear accident ever.
Saturday, 9 April.
Japan is still struggling to keep water on the reactors to cool them and prevent further meltdown. Russian Antonov An-124 cargo planes fly out of Atlanta and Los Angeles, each carrying a huge concrete boom pump. The two 95-ton boom pumps, which TEPCO purchased for $2million each, can be operated from two miles away by remote control. Each boom pump can direct focused streams of water into the damaged reactors.
Currently TEPCO does not plan to take a Chernobyl approach to resolving the nuclear power plant crisis by entombing the radioactive material in concrete. If this decision were to change, the boom pumps could be retrofitted to deliver concrete for that purpose.
Prior to the elevation to level 7 by the Japanese authorities James Acton, Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was of the opinion that "Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic, was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not."
A survey of radiation in seawater outside unit 2 shows radioactive isotope concentrations (iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137) falling for the third consecutive day since the leak was plugged. However, the levels are still high at several thousand times legal levels. Other nuclides are being investigated, but Japanese regulator NISA has flagged up problems with TEPCO's sampling methodology.
Monday, 11 April.
Coolant injection into reactors 1 and 3 is interrupted for 50 minutes due to a loss of power after a strong earthquake.
Workers plan to pump water into turbine condensers, but need to pump water out of them first. Work to transfer water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12 cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.
Tuesday, 12 April.
Japan officially raises Fukushima to INES Level 7, the same as Chernobyl. This new rating considers the accidents as a single event and uses estimated total release to the atmosphere as a justification.
Following the hydrogen explosion in the reactor 1 building on 12 March and releases from the reactor 3 building, the equivalent of 190,000 terabecquerels of radioactive iodine had been released from the reactor buildings by 15 March, according to calculations by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. A terabecquerel is equivalent to 1 trillion becquerels. The high level meant that by 15 March the Fukushima plant accident had already reached the worst level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, matching the assessment given to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Since that time the Fukushima reactors have continued to emit radiation; including atmospheric, water, and gamma ray releases.
At Chernobyl, approximately 10 times the amount of radiation was released into the atmosphere as was released from Fukushima I through 12 April 2011. The total amount of radioactive material still stored at Fukushima is about 8 times that stored at Chernobyl, and leakage at Fukushima continues.
After cooling efforts at spent fuel pool 4 were halted, due to an erroneous warning about the pool filling up, the temperature of the pool rises to 90 °C and the dose rate 6 meters above the pool spikes at 84 mSv/h.
Friday, 15 April.
Nuclear fuel is reported to have melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of reactors 1, 2 and 3. The melted material is not expected to breach a container (which might cause a massive radiation release). Instead, the melted fuel is thought to have dispersed fairly uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of the three reactors, which would make the resumption of the fission process, to the extent of a recriticality accident, 'most unlikely'; however, it is only during future dismantling of the three damaged reactors that it would be possible to verify this hypothesis and to know what really occurred inside the reactor cores.
Saturday, 16 April.
Plans are announced for a large-scale study on the environmental and health effects of radioactive contamination from the nuclear plant. Academics and researchers from across Japan will work with the Fukushima Prefectural Government starting in May.
Monday, 18 April.
The Associated Press is reporting that two PackBot ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49 mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57 mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant by the end of this year. Though more robots will be used a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do and eventually "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.
Test spraying of an "anti-scattering agent" on the ground to prevent further spread of radioactive materials from the site is carried out over an area of about 1200 m2.
Tuesday, 19 April.
TEPCO begins transferring excess radioactive cooling water from the reactor 2's basement and maintenance tunnels to a waste processing facility.  Operations to pump radioactive water in the basements of buildings of units 1, 2, 3 and their associated tunnels start with unit 2.
Friday, 22 April.
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan states additional towns might be asked to evacuate, which largely involves agricultural lands.  The government also plans to build 30,000 temporary homes by the end of May, and an additional 70,000 will follow.
The president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Masataka Shimizu, formally apologizes at the prefectural government office in Fukushima to the Fukushima Governor Yuhei Sato for the nuclear crisis following the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunamis. In response, the Governor requests better working conditions for the workers.
Tuesday, 26 April.
To prevent the proliferation of dust, TEPCO initiates spraying a synthetic resin to contain contaminated dust.
Wednesday, 27 April.
Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at Tokyo Electric Power Co., reports that radiation readings taken by two iRobot PackBot robots inside the reactor 1 building are as high as 1120 mSv/h, the highest level disclosed to date.
May.
Monday, 2 May.
T. Matsui of the University of Tokyo Institute of Physics releases a scientific paper analysing the ratio of iodine-131 to caesium-137 taken from water samples, which concludes that a recriticality may have occurred at least 10 - 15 days after the attempted shutdown.
Thursday, 5 May.
Workers enter the reactor 1 building. This is the first time since the start of the crisis that a reactor building in the plant is visited by a human being. The workers will connect a ventilation system that should absorb radiation inside the building for the next 4–5 days, allowing them to start installation of the cooling system replacement. Because of protective gear the workers are only exposed to a small amount of radiation (about 2 mSv). TEPCO expects to bring the plant into a cold shutdown within six to nine months. IAEA releases a briefing.
Tuesday, 10 May.
In a press release, TEPCO reports that levels of cesium-134, cesium-136, cesium-137, and iodine-131 (half-life of ~ 8 days), had spiked since last sampled on 2 March 2011, when these four nuclides were below detection limits. TEPCO's report gives the newly measured concentration (Bq/cm3) of each nuclide as of sampling date, 8 May.
Thursday, 12 May.
TEPCO engineers confirm that a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having fallen to the bottom of the reactor's containment vessel. The utility says fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed with the water level 1 meter (3.3 feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. The government and TEPCO are described as ""consistently appeared to be underestimating the severity of the situation."” According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel, and most of the fuel has likely melted. The nuclear fuel has possibly leaked into the containment vessel, which was damaged by an explosion during the crisis. However, the Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear lobbying firm, states that the situation ""is in no way alarming. It was anticipated that there was fuel damage in reactors 1, 2 and 3. This is confirmation."" 
Saturday, 14 May.
A third TEPCO (contractor) employee dies, after falling ill at 06:50, being brought to the plant's medical room unconscious.  The likely cause of death is a heart attack.  TEPCO says he was exposed to 0.17 millisieverts of radiation on Saturday. 
Sunday, 15 May.
A robot sent to the first floor of unit 1 records a radiation level of 2,000 mSv/h. At this level, workers would only be allowed to stay in the area for 8 minutes. In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO worker is able to peer into the basement and determines that the 11 m deep basement is approximately half full of water.
TEPCO releases a report on the core status of reactor 1, revealing that fuel elements had become exposed above the water just 4 hours after the earthquake and SCRAM, and had fully melted after 16 hours.
Wednesday, 18 May.
Four workers in protective suits and SCBA enter unit 2 for the first time since the 15 March explosion, to check on radiation levels and other conditions inside the building. The workers receive a dose of between 3 and 4 mSv each.
Friday, 20 May.
TEPCO president Masataka Shimizu resigns after reporting the largest financial losses in the company's history.
Sunday, 22 May.
TEPCO reports that reactor 3 leaked at least 250 tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean over a period of 41 hours beginning on 10 May 2011.
Tuesday, 24 May.
On the eve of the arrival in Tokyo of a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, TEPCO admits that the cores of reactor 2 and reactor 3 also melted down in the days immediately following the earthquake in mid-March 2011. 16 hours after the earthquake and SCRAM, the fuel rods of reactor 1 had "mostly melted and fallen into a lump at the bottom of the pressure vessel – a state that TEPCO officials have described as a 'meltdown'".
A TEPCO spokesman Yoshimi Hitosugi stated last night, "The situation inside two and three is almost the same." TEPCO further stated that the fuel in reactor three took about 60 hours to melt and that the reactor melted down 100 hours after the magnitude nine quake struck.
Wednesday, 25 May.
TEPCO informs the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the government of Fukushima Prefecture of the results of soil tests for plutonium (, and ) carried out around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. While the levels were comparable to the fallout in Japan from atmospheric nuclear testing, TEPCO deemed that the plutonium had originated from the accidents.
Saturday, 28 May.
TEPCO informs the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the government of Fukushima Prefecture of the results of soil tests for uranium (, and ) carried out around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The uranium found was considered to be natural, as its isotope ratios were consistent with the natural abundance.
At 21:14 a cooling pump at reactor five stops. At 08:12 the next day, work began on a spare pump, and cooling was restored at 12:49. The reactor temperature had risen to 92.2 °C. The cause of the outage is suspected to be motor failure.
Sunday, 29 May.
It is reported that 22 out of 23 radiation monitoring systems around the Fukushima plants were disabled by the earthquake and tsunami. Some were directly damaged, but most were disabled due to communication and power lines being cut. Even monitors equipped with backup satellite links failed, probably due to antenna damage. In Miyagi prefecture, 4 out of 7 were disabled by the tsunami, with the remaining three stopping after three hours. In Ibaraki, some 40 monitors stopped working for three hours until power could be restored.
The first of the typhoons of the season is due to strike the area, while Japan states radiation levels at the seabed are several hundreds of times above normal levels off the coast of Fukushima. "The Science Ministry announced late on Friday highly radioactive materials were detected in a 300-km north-south stretch from Kesennuma in Miyagi Prefecture to Choshi in Chiba Prefecture, the Kyodo news agency reported."
TEPCO reports that cooling has been restored for spent fuel pools 1 to 4.
Tuesday, 31 May.
An oil spill near reactors five and six is detected at 8:00 am, as well as an explosion heard at 2:30 pm near reactor four. TEPCO reports that the explosion was the bursting of an oxygen cylinder damaged by unmanned machinery during debris removal.
TEPCO states that there was a temporary oil leak into the sea near the plant, from an oil pipe that may have been damaged in the March disaster. It is stated as being an extremely small leak, possibly caused by recent rainy weather from Typhoon Songda. TEPCO says that the leak has stopped and oil fences have been installed to prevent the liquid from spreading into the Pacific Ocean.
June.
Friday, 3 June.
The first case is confirmed where radiation levels in humans have exceeded limits since the accident at the plant. One worker in his thirties received 678 mSv, while another one in his forties received 643 mSv. Before the accident the limit for emergency situations was 100 mSv, but it was raised by the government to 250 mSv just after the accident. The two TEPCO workers were on duty in the central control rooms of reactors Nos. 3 and 4 and told the health and labor ministry that they didn't remember whether they wore protective masks or not when a hydrogen explosion occurred at reactor No. 1 on 12 March.
Saturday, 4 June.
Air radiation readings of up to 4000 millisieverts per hour are recorded in the reactor 1 building.
Monday, 6 June.
Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) gives new estimates of the times at which the reactor pressure vessels were damaged and possibly dropped fuel into the containment vessels: 5 hours after the initial earthquake for reactor 1 (20:00 March 11); 80 hours for reactor 2 (22:50 March 14); and 79 hours for reactor 3 (22:10 March 14). In addition, NISA more than doubles its original estimate of radiation that escaped into the atmosphere in the first six days, from 370,000 terabecquerels to 770,000 terabecquerels.
Wednesday, 8 June.
The ministry of education says that strontium and have been detected in soil samples collected from late March to early May and 22–62 km away from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The highest values are reported in Namie town at 1,500 Bq/kg of strontium , and 250 Bq/kg of strontium .
The Japanese government's report on the Fukushima disaster to IAEA is described in an article in the Yomiuri newspaper. The government report states that nuclear fuel has possibly melted through the base of the pressure vessels in the first three reactors. With data from the government report, the newspaper compares the March timelines provided by TEPCO and by NISA, which had performed further analysis; there were differences in the theoretical timing of events of up to 29 hours in the days following the tsunami.
Thursday, 9 June.
A spokesman for TEPCO says the company is revising its earlier road-map for bringing the plant under control, including the time expected to achieve cold shutdown.
Tuesday, 14 June.
From 00:44 to 02:35 there is a massive steam and smoke release from unit 3, recorded by the TEPCO live cam. No explanation has been given yet by TEPCO officials.
Wednesday, 15 June.
TEPCO begins a trial run of a radioactive water treatment system in an effort to break away from the vicious cycle of injecting water into reactors to cool them and ending up with more contaminated water. While contaminated water is treated, the system is expected to produce about 2,000 cubic meters of radioactive sludge by the end of 2011.
Saturday, 18 June.
The radioactive water treatment system is forced to shut down because a filter exceeds its radioactivity limit. The separation unit, which removes caesium from the water, had been expected to last about a month before its cartridge required replacing; at a radiation level of 4 millisieverts per hour. The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.
Sunday, 19 June.
Radiation in some areas of Tsukidate, 50 km NW of the Fukushima 1 plant, exceeds the legal limit. The government plans to help households in designated areas to evacuate, raising concern among residents. Although the Tsukidate elementary school has not detected radiation levels in excess of the legal limit, about 80 parents and teachers thoroughly wash windows and verandas with high-pressure water jets and brushes and the school suspends activities on the playground in response to concern by parents.
Tuesday, 21 June.
A radiation reading of 430 millisieverts per hour is recorded in a mezzanine between the first floor and basement of reactor 2. This is the highest level measured up to this point in the reactor 2 building, and marks the first time that workers have entered the basement of this building since the beginning of the crisis.
Monday, 27 June.
Although the radioactive water treatment system has not yet started full-scale operation, a total of 1,850 tons of radioactive water has been processed during test runs of the system. Today this decontaminated water is used to cool the reactors for the first time. TEPCO states that it will continue injecting 16 tons of water per hour for cooling the 3 reactors, and that 13 tons of this will be made up from the decontaminated water. The recycling system operates for only 90 minutes before it is halted due to a burst connection which leaks about one ton of water.
Wednesday, 29 June.
TEPCO reports that tellurium-129m is found at 720 becquerels per liter of seawater collected on 4 June, detected near the water intake for the reactor 1; about 2.4 times safe levels. Though tellurium-129m has a short half-life of about 34 days, TEPCO denied that its detection indicated the possibility of a new leak of radioactive water into the sea.
Thursday, 30 June.
The Itabashi Ward Office announces that a concentration of cesium-134 at 2,700 becquerels per kilogram – in excess of the government's provisional limit – was detected in tea processed from leaves picked on 9 May in Tokyo.
July.
Sunday, 3 July.
The water decontamination and water recycling systems are now both functional. 100% recycled water is now used for reactor cooling, and no additional volume of contaminated water is being generated.
Monday, 4 July.
Radioactive caesium-137 is found in Tokyo's tap water for the first time since April. Radioactive caesium from Fukushima was expected to enter the Japanese seafood supply, and was projected to reach the US West Coast in 5 years.
Wednesday, 13 July.
The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission publishes a report dated 11 June 1993, (Heisei 5) whose title literally translates to "The event of entire alternating current station blackout on the nuclear power plant (原子力発電所における全交流電源喪失事象について)" conducted by a working group. This reports the results of an evaluation of the regulations to prevent and handle an occurrence of the full loss of alternating current (Station Blackout or SBO) in nuclear power plants in Japan and other countries. It concludes that further discussion is needed on methods to avoid or recover from such accidents. It also reports that the probability of an SBO in Japan is lower than in other countries.2.

Thursday, 14 July.
The number of people actively working at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant is about 3,000. NISA orders TEPCO to boost the number of safety managers to support this large number of workers.
The water decontamination systems continue to be plagued by leaks and filter problems. Over the last week they had been operating at an average of 73% capacity, below the target of 90% which is required to meet the current timetable.
Saturday, 16 July.
In a joint assessment the Japanese government and TEPCO say they have completed the first step of a 3-month plan outlined in mid-April for a complete cold shutdown. Reactors 1, 2 and 3 have been cooled down to a stable level and nitrogen has been injected into their containment vessels to prevent hydrogen explosions; however, the assessment admits that contaminated water has leaked out of storage tanks, and that water level settings at its water purification facilities were incorrect.
August.
Monday, 1 August.
A radiation level of 10 sieverts per hour is read at a ventilation shaft between reactors 1 and 2. The area is subsequently sealed. The reading of 10 Sv is the maximum for many Geiger counters, including those used for these readings. One official states that it is entirely possible that the radiation readings were higher since the counter was reading its maximum. Radiation has been impeding attempts to replace cooling systems. These are the highest readings logged indoors since the initial March 2011 explosions.
Tuesday, 2 August.
On Tuesday, 2 August, a radiation level of 5 sieverts per hour is detected on the second floor of the turbine building in reactor 1. The radioactivity rates detected on 2 and 1 August are considered lethal for even brief human exposures, an exposure of 0.1 Sv being the normal accepted workplace exposure over 5 years and 8 Sv or 8 Gray (8Gy) being a 100% lethal dose.
Wednesday, 10 August.
Installation of the new, closed circulation cooling system is finished for all four damaged reactors (1–4), reactor 1 being the last. Previously, cooling was achieved with water injection by giant pump trucks.
The water decontamination system is not working as well as expected, operating at roughly 66% of expected performance and suffering from numerous malfunctions. The system is necessary to decontaminate the large amount of radioactive water that remains on the site.
September.
Thursday, 8 September.
The Japan Atomic Energy Agency calculates that a total of 15,000 terabecquerels of radiation has been released into the sea from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant.
Friday, 16 September.
Research indicates that the meltdown of reactor number 2 could have been avoided if water was injected to cool the reactor 4 hours earlier. Water injection was started at 8 pm on 14 March after the cooling system failed at 1 pm that day. The meltdown could have been avoided if injection had started by 4 pm.
Wednesday, 21 September.
Typhoon Roke brings strong winds and up to 42 cm of rain to some areas of NE Japan. At the same time a magnitude 5.3 earthquake strikes just south of Fukushima. No significant problems are reported at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.
Thursday, 29 September.
The measured core temperature is now below 100 degrees Celsius for all 3 damaged reactors. Reactor number 2 finally achieved this status today, while reactors 1 and 3 have been below 100 degrees since August.
Hydrogen is found at concentrations of 61 to 63 percent in pipes connected to the reactor 1 containment vessel. Plans are made to check for hydrogen in the pipes of all reactors and flush if necessary to prevent the possibility of another explosion.
October.
Saturday, 8 October.
The Economist reports that high levels of radioactive particles, including plutonium have been found in an extended irregular zone that extends well outside the 30 km evacuation radius around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant.
Monday, 31 October.
A French study by the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety revealed that the Fukushima nuclear disaster caused the biggest discharge of radioactive material into the ocean in history. The radioactive cesium that flowed into the sea from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant was 20 times the amount estimated by its owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co. Atmospheric releases were cited as amounting to 35,800 terabecquerels of cesium 137 by the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics journal—an estimate about 42 percent of that released into the atmosphere in the Chernobyl explosion in 1986. Cesium 137 has a half-life of 30 years.
November.
Tuesday, 1 November.
TEPCO reports the completion of a cover for the reactor unit 1, which is 54 metres high, 47 metres wide and 42 metres deep. The cover has a built-in ventilation system that is supposed to filter radioactive material.
Wednesday, 2 November.
Boric acid is injected into reactor number 2 after the discovery of xenon in its containment vessel. The presence of xenon may be an indication that a self-sustained fission reaction has been occurring.
Friday, 4 November.
TEPCO retracts Wednesday's statement about a possible self-sustained fission reaction, and now claims that the xenon was a result of the normal decay of radioisotopes in the fuel.
Thursday, 17 November.
The Japanese government bans shipments of rice from a farm near the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. 630 becquerels of cesium per kilogram was found in the rice, over the 500 becquerels of cesium per kilogram allowed for human consumption. (From hundreds of spots tested around Fukushima, none had previously exceeded the limit.)
Tuesday, 29 November.
TEPCO now claims that there was no explosion at reactor number 2 on 15 March as previously reported, and that instead the explosion occurred at reactor number 4. However, TEPCO has no explanation for the observed rise in radioactive emissions from reactor 2 at this time.
Wednesday, 30 November.
TEPCO reports that a new computer simulation of the meltdown shows nuclear fuel rod material melting through the pressure vessel and deep inside the concrete of the primary containment vessel, within a foot of breaching it fully in Reactor No. 1. In the pessimistic scenario, all of the fuel of Reactor No. 1 has escaped the pressure vessel, as well as a majority of the fuel for Reactor No. 2 and 3.
December.
Saturday, 3 December.
Forty-five tons of highly radioactive water leaked from the apparatus being used to decontaminate the water at the plant. Plant workers attempted to contain the leak, but it was unknown if any of the water escaped into the water table or the ocean.
Thursday, 15 December.
A long-range timetable is announced for the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. The plan is to repair the damaged containment vessels and determine the condition of the melted fuel by the end of 2021, then begin the retrieval of this fuel in 2022. The full duration of the schedule is 40 years, with the decommissioning work to be completed by 2052.
Friday, 16 December.
In a joint statement by TEPCO and the Japan government it is announced that the reactors have achieved a state of cold shutdown. Temperatures in the containment vessels were 38.9 degrees Celsius for reactor one, 67.5 degrees for reactor two, and 57.4 degrees for reactor 3. This announcement failed to lay to rest substantial concerns arising from TEPCO's inability to directly measure temperatures at the bottoms of the containment vessels, and the fact that the site is too radioactive for visual confirmation of the fuel rods' status.
Sunday, 18 December.
230 tons of highly radioactive water is discovered in a tunnel below a building that stores contaminated water, raising questions about TEPCO's inspection and management capabilities. TEPCO admits that this radioactive water may be mixing with the ground water, yet claims that the tunnel is not connected to the sea.
Tuesday, 20 December.
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko, visiting Japan, confirmed that the Daiichi reactors were stable. Said Jaczko, "The temperatures have decreased significantly, the amount of heat that's being produced from the reactor fuel itself is very, very low now. So it simply doesn't have the kind of energy, if you will, that's needed to have any kind of off-site releases of radiation. I feel very comfortable with the (government's cold shutdown) decision."
Monday, 26 December.
An interim report was issued by the investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura. In the report, the panel concluded that poor internal communication by the Japanese government and faulty knowledge and actions by TEPCO employees contributed to the disaster. The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which could have told them of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi. TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor. TEPCO workers turned off an emergency cooling system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.
2012.
Thursday, 19 January 2012.
An attempt is made to view the state of the melted fuel in reactor 2 using a fibre-optic endoscope, however clear images of the water level and fuel location could not be obtained, probably due to the harsh environment inside the containment vessel.
After radioactive water was discovered in a tunnel under reactor 2 on 18 December, the government directed TEPCO to survey the plant's underground facilities and check for more accumulation of radioactive water. Today, TEPCO finds an additional 500 tons of water containing 16,200 Bq/cm3 of radioactive caesium in a pit near reactor 2, and 600 tons of 860 Bq/cm3 water near reactor 3.
Wednesday, 22 February 2012.
TEPCO begins pouring a 60-centimetre-thick layer of concrete over 70,000 square metres of the ocean seabed near the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in an effort to contain contaminated sediments.
Tuesday, 27 March 2012.
TEPCO measures atmospheric radiation at several points inside the containment vessel of reactor 2 for the first time, and reports values of 31.1 and 72.9 Sv/h. The utility states that radiation is too high for robots, endoscopes, and other devices to work properly.
Thursday, 5 April 2012.
For the second time in 10 days highly radioactive wastewater is accidentally discharged into the sea. Today about 12 tons of wastewater leaks from a disconnected joint, a large portion of which flows into the sea through a drainage ditch.
Saturday, 5 May 2012.
Japan's last remaining active nuclear reactor goes offline. Since the Fukushima Daiichi incident, nuclear reactors have not been allowed to restart after being shut down for maintenance or safety checks. One by one the number of active nuclear reactors has steadily decreased until the last of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors is finally taken offline today.
Tuesday, 22 May 2012.
Japanese scientists report that the water depth inside reactor No. 1 is only 40 cm; much lower than expected, and low enough to expose some fuel. From this observation, it is concluded that a 2 cm hole may exist in a pipe that is 40 cm from the bottom of the vessel.
Thursday, 24 May 2012.
TEPCO releases new estimate of 900,000 terabecquerels for the total amount of radioactive material released from this facility into the environment.
Thursday, 5 July 2012.
Japan once again has a working nuclear reactor as the number 3 reactor at the Ohi nuclear plant begins generating power. This is the first reactor to be restarted since the tsunami, and marks the end of 2 months without nuclear power for Japan.
Friday, 12 October 2012.
TEPCO admits for the first time that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. TEPCO's internal reform task force, led by company President Naomi Hirose, said in a report TEPCO had feared efforts to better protect nuclear facilities from severe accidents such as tsunamis would trigger anti-nuclear sentiment, interfere with operations or increase litigation risks. TEPCO could have mitigated the impact of the accident if it had diversified power and cooling systems by paying closer attention to international standards and recommendations, the report said. TEPCO also should have trained employees with practical crisis management skills rather than conduct obligatory drills as a formality, it said. In the internal report TEPCO said that before the accident it had been afraid to consider the risk of such a large tsunami as the one in March 2011 which hit Fukushima, fearing admissions of risk could result in public pressure to shut plants down. “There were concerns that if new countermeasures against severe accidents were installed, concern would spread in host communities that the current plants had safety problems,” the report said. TEPCO said in the report that "severe accident measures" were taken in 2002, which included "containment venting and power supply cross-ties between units," but additional measures were never put in place. TEPCO added that taking such measures could also add to "public anxiety and add momentum to anti-nuclear movements."
2013.
Monday, 18 March 2013.
Public trust in TEPCO takes another hit as cooling systems for several spent fuel pools go down for more than 29 hours after a power interruption that may have been caused by a rat in a switchboard.
Tuesday, 9 July 2013.
Levels of cesium in groundwater from monitoring wells around the reactors jumps by 90 times compared with the levels 3 days earlier. The contamination is now measured at 9,000 becquerels of cesium-134 and 18,000 becquerels of cesium-137 per litre of water. As well, tritium levels in seawater from the port next to the plant have been increasing since May, and a water sample taken on July 3 showed 2,300 becquerels per litre, the highest measurement since the start of the nuclear crisis in March 2011.
Wednesday, 10 July 2013.
Japanese government admits Fukushima Daiichi may have been leaking radioactive water into ground water and into the ocean since 2011.
Monday, 22 July 2013.
TEPCO admits that since the 2011 reactor breaches, radioactive water has continued to leak from the plant into groundwater, making the groundwater radioactive, with implications for drinking water and for the Pacific.
Monday, 19 August 2013.
It is discovered that 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water (80 MBq/L) had leaked from a storage tank and seeped into the ground.
Wednesday, 21 August 2013.
Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority raises the severity of the contaminated water leaks at Fukushima to INES level 3 "serious incident".
Monday, 26 August 2013.
The Japanese government takes charge in dealing with the contaminated water situation. Trade minister Toshimitsu Motegi says “We’ve allowed Tokyo Electric to deal with the contaminated water situation on its own and they’ve essentially turned it into a game of Whack-a-Mole".
Sunday, 15 September 2013.
Japan is once again nuclear free as its only working reactor goes offline today for refuelling and maintenance.
Monday, 18 November 2013 15:18.
Workers have begun removing fuel rods from a storage pond at the Unit 4 reactor building. About 1,500 rods, some of them damaged, must be removed in a risky and dangerous operation set to take a year. Removed rods will then be moved into a more secure storage.
2014.
Thursday, January 9, 2014.
Nuclear scientists in Japan are planning a controlled nuclear meltdown in the hope of learning how to prevent disasters like the one at Fukushima. Using a scaled down version of a nuclear reactor, Tomoyuki Sugiyama, a senior scientist at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, told MSN Sankei that scientists "want to help improve the accuracy of the Fukushima accident analysis" using the data from their experiment. "We want to study exactly how meltdowns happen and apply what we will learn to help improve ways to deal with severe accidents in the future," another spokesman for the government-backed engineering agency told Agence France Presse. The experiment will test a small fuel rod in a very rapid fission process. The project will begin sometime later this year, the spokesman said.
Thursday, February 6, 2014.
The reanalysis of a groundwater sample taken from a well in July 2013 updates its measurement from 900,000 Bq/L total beta radioactivity to a record-high 5 MBq/L of strontium-90 only (corresponding to about 10 MBq/L total beta radioactivity), after a problem with the measuring devices was found in October.
Thursday, February 13, 2014.
It was revealed that TEPCO had concealed for months the increase in measured groundwater radioactivity.
Thursday, February 20, 2014.
Earlier this week a routine inspection discovers an overflowing tank which had leaked about 3,175 gallons of highly contaminated water onto the ground. The spill was caused by a valve that was left open by mistake. Radiation readings of the ground nearby measure 230 MBq/L, including strontium-90. TEPCO claims it is unlikely that the water had spilled into the sea.
Wednesday, May 21, 2014.
TEPCO begins operation to bypass groundwater flow around the reactor by pumping upstream groundwater to storage tanks, then discharging directly to the sea after measuring the contamination levels.
Tuesday, June 3, 2014.
TEPCO begins to construct facilities to establish an "ice wall" within the ground around the reactors to prevent contaminated water to mix with groundwater flowing under the area.
Monday, July 7, 2014.
TEPCO has switched off the cooling system at reactor 5 due to a 3mm leak near a flow valve. Approximately 1300 liters of water has spilled. They have approximately 9 days to repair it before water temperature reaches 65 degrees Celsius

1999–2000 Aston Villa F.C. season

During the 1999–2000 English football season, Aston Villa competed in the FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons).
Season summary.
Aston Villa matched their previous season's solid sixth place finish. After starting the campaign brightly, a run of nine matches without a win dragged Villa down to 15th. However, after that Villa rallied to go 12 matches unbeaten, and thereafter lost only two more games all season to finish sixth. Villa also reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 43 years, but their hopes of winning the famous trophy for the eighth time were ended by a 1–0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea, whose success was achieved in the last game at Wembley before the old stadium was rebuilt.

Diminished major seventh chord

In music theory, a diminished major seventh chord is a chord composed of a diminished triad and a major seventh. Thus it is composed of a root, minor third, diminished fifth (tritone) and major seventh. It is very dissonant, containing the dissonant intervals of the tritone and the major seventh. It is frequently encountered, especially in jazz, as a diminished seventh chord with an appoggiatura, especially when the melody has the leading note of the given chord: the ability to resolve this dissonance smoothly to a diatonic triad with the same root allows it to be used as a temporary tension before tonic resolution. However, it is infrequently used as a chord in itself.
The chord can be represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 6, 11}.

Henry George Fryberg

Justice Henry George Fryberg is a current Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Australia. Justice Fryberg was sworn in on 23 September 1994.
Notable Cases.
Brisbane City Council v. Matthews.
"Brisbane City Council v. Matthews" QSC 25, involved an application brought under the "Vexatious Proceedings Act" as a result of the numerous proceedings brought by the respondent Mathews against the Brisbane City Council (BCC) and other parties. Mathews was a disability pensioner as a result of a head injury he had sustained many years before, and his injuries affected his ability to concentrate for long periods. Justice Fryberg heard the application before all chamber applications in the list that day in order to assist the respondent, who was self-represented, in being able to present his case. 
After noting that Mathews had brought multiple proceedings, Justice Fryberg found that they were vexatious under the meaning of the Act:
As a result, Justice Fryberg declared Mathews a vexatious litigant and made an order prohibiting him from commencing any new proceedings against BCC.
Legal Services Commissioner v Quinn.
The case of "Legal Services Commissioner v Quinn" QLPT 19 concerned a Discipline Application brought against a solicitor in the Legal Services Tribunal. The Application followed Quinn’s guilty plea and conviction for importing child pornography, possessing a child abuse computer game and possessing child abuse photographs in the District Court of Queensland in 2007. The Application was brought by the Legal Services Commission following the convictions. 
Justice Fryberg’s judgment was delivered "ex tempore" and was notably brief, since this was an extremely uncomplicated case for the tribunal. At the hearing, His Honour stated that: 
As a result, Quinn’s entitlement to practice was removed.
R v Bruce Gordon Ward.
The accused, a surgeon, was accused of negligently cutting a patient's vein during an operation and prescribing blood-thinning drugs that hastened her death.
On 5 March 2009, a hearing took place in order to resolve disclosure issues, as well as when the trial would be held. His Honour rejected the proposed directions submitted by the defence because they would not provide sufficient disclosure to the proxsecution of the expert evidence to be presented by the defence.
In August 2009, new evidence emerged from nurses, leading to Justice Fryberg suggesting that the case against the accused was not strong enough to likely lead to conviction. The prosecution subsequently dropped the charge, and so Ward was acquitted.
R v. Hargraves and Stoten.
In 2010, Justice Fryberg heard the case of "R v. Hargraves and Stoten" QSC 188, two men charged with count of conspiracy to dishonestly cause a loss to a Commonwealth entity between May 2001 and June 2005.

Organisational Learning Australia

Organisational Learning Australia is an educational support service, established in March 2010. Its consulting and training programmes assist groups such as Registered Training Organisation (RTO), businesses, community groups and non-profit bodies.
On 7 October 2010, the Victorian Auditor-Generals Office tabled a report that found the VRQA cannot reliably assure that it has effectively regulated VET providers. 
On 10 February 2011, the Australian Senate jointly referred the legislation to establish the NVR - comprising the National VET Regulator Bill 2010 the National VET Regulator Transitional Provisions Bill 2010 [2011, and the National VET Regulator (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 - to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. Despite a tradition of lengthy enquiries, the timetable for transferring regulatory responsibility from the states and territories to the NVR varies. It is anticipated that New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will move across from the establishment date. Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are anticipated to transfer responsibility before the end of 2011.

Bit.Trip Fate

Bit.Trip Fate, marketed as BIT.TRIP FATE, is an arcade-style scrolling shooter music game developed by Gaijin Games and published by Aksys Games for the Wii's WiiWare download service.
Gameplay.
Bit.Trip Fate takes place over three environments, each divided into two stages and culminating in a boss encounter. The first environment (stages Determination and Patience) resembles a crystal cavern over a space backdrop, the second (stages Desperation and Frustration) a cityscape filled with skyscrapers, and the third (stages Anger and Fall) an underground pit with rivers of magma. 
The game's hybrid mechanics feature a side perspective, resembling a horizontal shooter, but with Commander Video confined to a set path, called the Vibe (along which he can freely move forward and backward), an element of rail shooters. In addition, the player controls Commander Video's movement independently of his targeting reticule, similar to the style of twin-stick games descended from "". The reticule is commanded by the Wii Remote's IR pointer, with bullets firing radially from Commander Video's location. Movement along the rail is faster while the player is not holding down the trigger button. The rail takes on various shapes, usually similar to a sine wave, which are predetermined by the stage, while the screen scrolls at a steady rate. Enemies advance from all directions, firing targeted and patterned bullets tradition to shoot 'em ups.
The player's performance and interaction with enemies creates musical feedback which contributes to the stage's soundtrack, providing an element similar to certain music games, particularly "Rez". The gameplay is less rhythmically constrained than previous entries in the series, providing more freedom to the player, but also less dynamic feedback.

<doc id="31167966" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31167966" title="Bit.Trip Flux">
Bit.Trip Flux

Bit.Trip Flux, marketed as BIT.TRIP FLUX, is an arcade-style rhythm game developed by Gaijin Games and published by Aksys Games for the Wii's WiiWare download service.
Gameplay.
Bit.Trip Flux plays very similarly to that of the first game in the Bit.Trip series, Bit.Trip Beat. The player must hold the Wii Remote in a sideways position and rotate it towards or away to cause the paddle on-screen to move up or down in an attempt to reflect beats (square blocks moving towards the player’s side of the screen).
Different types of beats will move from the left side of the screen towards the right. The player must reflect all of them (except for bonus beats and avoid blobs). As the player successfully reflects beats, a bar at the top of the screen will start to fill. When it does, the graphics will change and the player will mode-up to a higher mode and earn more points for each beat. If the player fails to reflect a beat, a bar at the bottom of the screen will start to fill. When it does, the graphics will change and the player will mode-down to a lower mode and earn less points for each beat. Should the player mode-down to the lowest mode, the Nether mode, they must mode-up or they will be sent to the beginning of the last checkpoint.
There are 3 main levels to the game: Epiphany, Perception, and Catharsis. At the start, the player can only choose the Epiphany level, and must beat it to unlock Perception. After beating Perception, the player will unlock Catharsis. Each main level is divided into smaller levels that have checkpoints after completing each one. These checkpoints, however, can only be reached in the same play session. If the player quits the game, they will have to start at the beginning of one of the 3 main levels.
Display.
The screen is divided into 3 parts. The top part shows the name of the mode the player will be in, which will change (or mode-up) if the bar below the name fills completely. The top bar fills as the player earns points from successfully reflecting beats. In the top right corner, the player’s current score is shown. The middle part is the main area of play, where the player’s paddle is on the right edge of the screen and beats move from left to right before being reflected back. As the player reflects higher numbers of beats in succession, a number will briefly appear each time to show the count of the chain. The bottom part of the screen shows the name of the mode the player will move down to (or mode-down) if the bar next to it fills completely. The bottom bar fills as the player misses beats or hits avoid blobs. In the bottom right corner is the bonus multiplier that shows how much additional points each beat will add to the player’s score.
Key differences from Bit.Trip Beat.
While Bit.Trip Beat has the player controlling a paddle on the left edge of the screen with beats coming from the right side of the screen, Bit.Trip Flux instead puts the player’s paddle on the right edge of the screen. Beats come from the left side of the screen in Bit.Trip Flux.
The colors used for each beat in Bit.Trip Beat give the player a visual clue of what beat type each is, ranging from yellow (normal beat that moves in straight line), orange (beat bounces back toward the player and must be hit multiple times), green (beat fades to transparent and back), and many more. However, in Bit.Trip Flux, the beats are now a uniform white color, regardless of beat type. Bit.Trip Flux adds new avoid blobs that are more circular in shape (keeping with the pixelated style) that will fill the player’s Nether bar (and cause the player to move down a mode).
Level progression is also different from Bit.Trip Beat in that the player can reach checkpoints throughout each level. Whereas in Bit.Trip Beat after dying, the player would have to start from the beginning of the level (Transition, Descent, or Growth), Bit.Trip Flux puts the player at the beginning of the last checkpoint they passed, showing “Reset” on-screen as the last checkpoint automatically begins. This feature also means that high scores will not be saved unless the player successfully completes the level.
Bit.Trip Beat can be played by up to 4 players simultaneously (with the size of the paddles reduced), whereas Bit.Trip Flux can only be played by up to 2 players simultaneously.

James H. Cromartie

James H. Cromartie is an internationally renowned American artist credited with the birth of Hard-Edge Realism, a style by turns both redolent of and a departure from the Magic Realism pioneered by Andrew Wyeth. The list of celebrities and wealthy patrons reported to be among his collectors is extensive and examples of Cromartie’s work may be found in 125 countries across the globe. Domestically, Cromartie has been called, “one of America’s leading historical artists,” for his commissioned portraits of the White House, Smithsonian Institution, U.S Capitol and Supreme Court, among others. In 2005, James H. Cromartie’s historical portrait of the White House was featured in the widely distributed art history textbook, ArtTalk, a distinction granted to a mere 25 living artists globally. Cromartie has resided year-round on Nantucket, Massachusetts for over 35 years, proudly quipping, “there are Nantucket artists, but then again there are…artists who have chosen to live on Nantucket. There’s a b-i-g difference.” 
Early life.
James H. Cromartie was born into one of North Carolina’s oldest and most prominent families, initially possessing over one-tenth of the state’s entire territory. Despite the ease with which he could have obtained a career in civil service given his family’s numerous political connections, a young Jim found himself inexorably drawn to the world of fine art, relishing, in particular, the renowned realist artists, Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Cromartie remembers, “They had a small bookstore in the museum…as a young third and fourth grade child I would steal those little books from the Mint Museum. Well I didn’t actually steal them all, I would buy one and take three, but I guess that’s the same thing.” Inspired by these canonical works, but only able to view the bookstore’s reproductions, Jim would later inadvertently pioneer a style that would be uniquely his own, Hard-Edge Realism. First, however, an important patron was fated to enter the life of the young artist, James H. Cromartie.
Rockefeller Patronage.
Late in the summer of 1969, Nelson and Happy Rockefeller paid a visit to James H. Cromartie’s gallery on Nantucket. They bought two paintings that day for 600 dollars apiece. Jim remembers, “word spread across Old South Wharf and, then, across the entire town like a wildfire. ‘The Rockefellers only bought two paintings while they were on the island and they both were Jim Cromartie’s.’” 
The following summer Nelson Rockefeller returned to Cromartie’s gallery with longtime friend and college chum, Roger Firestone. They proceeded to buy every Cromartie in the gallery and would later promise their continued patronage indefinitely until James H. Cromartie fully realized what would soon become his signature note, Hard-Edge Realism. Cromartie recalls, “it was like somebody put me on a rocket and my work just took off.” 
The birth of Hard-Edge Realism.
Early in his career, James H. Cromartie reports to have often surveyed the printed works of Andrew Wyeth for hours on end attempting to decode a technique so seamless it did not even bear the stroke of a brush. It would be years before Cromartie, confident that he had finally mastered Wyeth’s technique, actually stood in front of an original Wyeth only to find the canvas, so immaculately rendered in his books, covered in brush strokes. Thus, in simply attempting to emulate Andrew Wyeth, James H. Cromartie inadvertently spawned Hard-Edge Realism, “launching him on a journey that would take him around the world and into the company of many of society’s elite.” 
James H. Cromartie, himself, while accepting the popular use of the term, Hard-Edge Realism, believes his style to be more correctly stated as “surrealistic impressionism.” Cromartie, describes his work in Nantucket Portrait: Fun & Games with the Super Rich the Birth of Hard-Edge Realism thus, 
Work as a Historical Artist.
James H. Cromartie’s body of work includes commissioned historical portraits of the Smithsonian, Capitol, White House, and U.S. Supreme Court. The first of these commissions came in 1985 by personal request from the Smithsonian curator’s daughter, Sharon Boyd, to paint its iconic original building, The Castle. Prints of James H. Cromartie’s portrait of The Castle are today presented as gifts to visiting foreign dignitaries. Following the success of the Smithsonian portrait, Cromartie received a second commission to paint the U.S. Capitol from its eponymous Historical Society. At the unveiling, Senator Sam Nunn chided Cromartie for leaving out the flag over the domed Capitol; in response, Cromartie quickly proceeded to paint the flag right where Nunn stood. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich personally thanked Cromartie for the portrait in a letter calling it, “an exceptional and truly beautiful work of art.” 
Perhaps the most personal of all James H. Cromartie’s historical commissions was that which he received to paint the official portrait of the White House, as Cromartie’s fourth great-grandfather, James Hoban, designed it. The portrait was personally received by President Ronald Reagan and would later be chosen, along with Cromartie’s portrait of the Capitol, by the U.S. State Department to feature prominently in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. James H. Cromartie’s latest commissioned historical portrait of the U.S. Supreme Court rounded out his career as “one of America’s leading historical artists,” and is thus affectionately referred to by him as the “third jewel.” 
Reception.
James H. Cromartie’s oeuvre has enjoyed a warm reception both critically and commercially. Kirk M. Crist of the Naples Daily News recognized Cromartie early on as being, “truly on the threshold of one of the most brilliant art careers this country has ever known.” Paul Chelko, former art critic for the Atlanta Journal, effusively praised Cromartie’s work, writing, “brilliance cannot be defined, nor genius denied, it is all here…what Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, and many others have done, artistic evolution it seems, has granted us something more.” James H. Cromartie has amassed a number of celebrity collectors to date including Tom Brokaw, Roger Firestone, Princess Diana, Steve Forbes, Nelson Rockefeller, and Robert Duvall.

<doc id="31168026" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31168026" title="Zhang Xiong">
Zhang Xiong

Zhang Xiong (張雄) (d. 893) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who, from 886 and on, controlled an army that initially roved in the lower Yangtze River region and became a key player in the power struggles between various warlords for the control of Huainan (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Zhenhai (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) Circuits. Zhang eventually settled in at Shangyuan (上元, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) in 887 and controlled the area until his death in 893.
Background.
Zhang Xiong was originally from Lianshui (漣水, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), and he served as an officer at Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which Lianshui belonged to. Once, when fellow officer Feng Hongduo, who was also from Lianshui, was accused of impropriety by circuit administrators, Zhang spoke on his behalf, and Zhang's doing so caused Ganhua's military governor ("Jiedushi") Shi Pu to suspect both of them. In 886, knowing that Shi suspected them, Zhang and Feng gathered 300 men and left Ganhua with them, crossing the Yangtze River to attack Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which then belonged to Zhenhai Circuit. They captured it, and Zhang claimed the title of prefect. Eventually, he was able to gather an army reaching the size of 50,000, with 1,000 ships, and called his army Tiancheng Army (天成軍).
Roving campaigns.
Zhang Xiong's occupation of Su Prefecture drew the displeasure and apprehension of Zhenhai's military governor Zhou Bao. As Zhou had heard that Xu Yue (徐約), an officer under Zhou's rival Gao Pian the military governor of Huainan, had a strong army, he induced Xu to attack Su Prefecture, promising to give the prefecture to him if Xu were successful. In summer 887, Xu attacked Zhang; Zhang was unable to withstand the attack, and he took his army east out to the East China Sea. He sent his officer Zhao Hui (趙暉) with part of the army and part of the fleet west on the Yangtze to take over Shangyuan, and Zhao was able to do so.
Meanwhile, Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (揚州) had become embroiled in internecine warfare, as the officer Bi Shiduo, fearful that Gao's trusted sorcerer Lü Yongzhi was about to kill him, mutinied and captured Yang Prefecture, taking Gao under his control. Zhang used this opportunity to approach it, stopping his army at Dongtang (東塘, in modern Yangzhou), near Yang Prefecture. Subsequently, war again erupted between Bi and his ally Qin Yan the governor (觀察使, "Guanchashi") of Xuanshe Circuit (宣歙, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) (whom Bi offered the military governorship of Huainan to) and Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (廬州, in modern Hefei, Anhui), who put Yang Prefecture under siege. Qin and Bi wanted Zhang's aid, as they were running low on food supplies, and they exchanged the wealths of the city for food supplies from Zhang. However, Zhang's army, after they received the wealths of the city, refused to engage in battle on Qin's and Bi's behalf. Thereafter, Yang Xingmi captured the city, and Qin and Bi fled. They initially tried to join Zhang, but Zhang refused to receive them, and they instead joined forces with Qin Zongheng (秦宗衡), the brother of Qin Zongquan, who had proclaimed himself emperor at Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). (Qin Zongheng was subsequently assassinated by his lieutenant Sun Ru, who then executed Qin Yan and Bi, defeated Yang Xingmi, and took over Yang Prefecture.)
Meanwhile, with Zhou having himself lost control of Zhenhai Circuit in a mutiny, many of Zhou's soldiers fled to Zhao. Zhao thus became arrogant, and he rebuilt Tai Castle (臺城), a major defense mechanism for Jiankang, the ancient capital of the Southern Dynasties, as his residence, and began to live luxuriously. He also stopped communicating with Zhang. When Zhang left Dongtang and advanced west on the Yangtze, Zhao further tried to stop him. In anger, Zhang attacked Shangyuan and captured it. Zhao fled but was killed by his own subordinates. Zhang killed all of Zhao's soldiers who surrendered, and settled in at Shangyuan.
Control of Shangyuan.
Meanwhile, Yang Xingmi had returned to Lu Prefecture and was plotting to attack Zhao Huang the governor of Xuanshe (whom Qin Yan had left in charge of Xuanshe when he left to contend for control of Huainan). Yang persuaded Zhang Xiong and Sun Duan (孫端) the prefect of He Prefecture (和州, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) to first attack Zhao, forcing Zhao to engage them. While Zhao was able to defeat Zhang and Sun, Yang then himself attacked Zhao and defeated him, eventually capturing his capital Xuan Prefecture (宣州) and taking over Xuanshe as its governor.
In 890, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong established a new Sheng Prefecture (昇州) at Shangyuan and made Zhang its prefect. Zhang died in 893, and Feng Hongduo succeeded him as prefect. It was said that Zhang's soldiers missed him for his leadership skills, and they built a temple to worship him.

2001–02 Aston Villa F.C. season

During the 2001–02 English football season, Aston Villa competed in the Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership for sponsorship reasons).
Season summary.
Aston Villa's early season form was good and the Midlanders even went top briefly at the end of November, but followed that with a run of eleven games with only one win, falling out of the title race. Still, it came as a shock when John Gregory announced his resignation after four years as Villa manager on 24 January. A host of names were linked with the vacancy, but in the end it was Graham Taylor, who took Villa to promotion in 1988 and second place in the league in 1990, who was appointed manager. Taylor was unable to improve Villa's form, but two wins against Southampton and Chelsea at the end of the season where enough to see Villa finish eighth: this was hardly amazing, but it at least meant that Villa would be finishing in the top 10 for the seventh year in succession.

Berklee method

In music performance and education, the Berklee method is the music theory, terminology, and practice taught at Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world. The "Berklee method" was founded by Lawrence Berk after study with Joseph Schillinger regarding the latter's, "elaborate system of composition that employed mathematical permutation and combination process to generate rhythms, harmonies, and melodies". Later, attempting to codify jazz and popular music practice, the Berklee method often differs from common practice harmony and voice-leading rules or guidelines.
For example, "Berklee Music Theory - Book 2" recommends the following accompaniment for a given lead sheet, while common practice theory would advise against or rule out the progression on the basis of all the chords being sevenths and thus dissonant.
The following quote from Branford Marsalis, may exemplify how Berklee also differs from traditional jazz: "Berklee has its own system of doing things, the Berklee way, the Berklee method. They basically say that when you write things that are theoretically against the Berklee method, then they're incorrect. Even if they sound great. Musically they sound, but theoretically it's wrong, so it's wrong. Which is not the purpose of music. Music theories are just theories."

Northern Ontario Curling Association

When it comes to curling in Canada, Northern Ontario is treated as if it were a province. It is the only sub-provincial region that sends teams to the various national championships. Only the Scotties Tournament of Hearts lacks a separate Northern Ontario team. Northern Ontario's separate entry exists due to historical precedent. Ever since the very first Brier has Northern Ontario been represented. The rest of Ontario is governed by the Ontario Curling Association.
The NOCA was founded in 2007 upon the amalgamation of the Northwestern Ontario Curling Association, Northern Ontario Ladies Curling Association, the former Northern Ontario Curling Association and Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Curling Association. Prior to 2007, the region as a whole was governed by the Northern Ontario Curling Federation.

Richard Gorham

Sir Richard Matthew Gorham CBE, DFC, JP (3 October 1917 - 8 July 2006) was a prominent Bermudian parliamentarian, businessman and philanthropist, who served as a pilot during the Second World War when he played a decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Second World War.
Bermuda Volunteer Engineers.
Born in Pembroke, Bermuda, the son of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Gorham, he enlisted in the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers in 1938. The unit was mobilised, along with the other part-time units of the Bermuda Garrison (the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC), and the Bermuda Militia Infantry), when the Second World War was declared. As a Corporal, he was attached to the signalling division at the Royal Naval Dockyard, he earned a commission as a result of his saving an exercise when he suggested an emergency method of signalling visually to replace a broken wireless transmitter.
As a Lieutenant he learnt of an instruction from the Army Council prevented commanding officers from preventing officers under their command from taking any training course for which they volunteered (although his commanding officer, Major Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC - having transferred from the BVRC in France to the Royal Flying Corps when he had been commissioned during the First World War, and heading the Bermuda Flying School during the Second World War - must undoubtedly have approved of what Gorham intended).
Royal Artillery and Royal Air Force.
At the time, the Royal Air Force was having great difficulty in providing effective Air Observation Post pilots to the British Army. In 1918, the British Amy lost its air wing when the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to create the independent Royal Air Force (RAF). Since then, the RAF had jealously guarded its monopoly on British military and naval aviation. They provided the Royal Navy with RAF aircrew and support personnel to operate the aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, although the Navy had been allowed to begin training its own aircrew before the war began. The RAF also provided the aircraft and crews that worked in close support roles to the Army, notably the AOP pilots. These were pilots of light aircraft, such as the Auster, who acted as artillery spotters, directing the fire of the guns of the Royal Artillery from the air. Having had poor success at training RAF pilots to direct artillery fire, it was decided to train Army officers who were proficient at the task to pilot aeroplanes. This preceded the recreation of a new air wing within the British Army, the Army Air Corps (which initially included parachute and glider landed units, as well as the Glider Pilot Regiment, but would eventually take over the AOP and other air support roles from the RAF). Then Lieutenant Gorham requested to train for this role, and was detached from the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers to travel to England for the training. Transferred into the Royal Artillery, and trained by the RAF, he served in a squadron controlled by the RAF. He served in North Africa and Italy. In Italy, while in command of B Flight of 655 Squadron, he played the decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino when he spotted a German division moving in half-tracked German Armoured Personnel Carriers to counter attack the British 5th Division and the Polish Corps, which were themselves attacking the German-occupied monastery. Contacting the senior Royal Artillery fire control officer on the ground. All two-thousand field guns within range were switched from their local targets and placed under his control. Gorham directed their fire down onto the German Division. The guns fired for hours, with Gorham taking turns with other AOP pilots. The German division was completely destroyed, and the Allied ground forces broke through four days later. For this action, Gorham received the Distinguished Flying Cross, a relative rarity for an Army officer.
Post-war service.
Returning to Bermuda after the War with the rank of Captain, Gorham found his original unit, the BVE, was disbanded in 1946. All of the other local military units were demobilised at the same time, though the BVRC and BMA would both maintain skeleton command structures till their strength was built back up again in 1951 (they would amalgamate in 1965 into the Bermuda Regiment). Gorham entered the BVRC in which he served for a number of years. He was part of the detachment sent to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
Civil life.
In his civil life, Richard Gorham became a prominent businessman and Member of the Parliament of Bermuda (originally titled "Member of the Colonial Parliament", or MCP, but today simply "Member of Parliament", or MP). He donated much of his wealth to a host of causes, including the Bermuda Maritime Museum, and the Bermuda Sloop Foundation.

Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement

The Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement refers to the movement of the Bengali Hindu people for the Partition of Bengal in 1947 to create a homeland for themselves within the Indian Union, in the wake of Muslim League's proposal and campaign to include the entire province of Bengal within Pakistan, which was to be a homeland for the Muslims of British India. The movement began in late 1946, especially after the Noakhali riots, gained significant momentum in April, 1947 and in the end met with success on 20 June 1947 when the legislators from the Hindu majority areas returned their verdict in the favour of Partition.
Background.
Deterioration of law and order.
The law and order situation had rapidly deteriorated in Kolkata after the riots. When the Inspector General of Police asked for 50% increase in the Calcutta Armed Police Force, the Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy insisted that the new recruits must all be Punjabi Muslims to which Governor Frederick Burrows readily agreed. To speed up training they must be ex-servicemen. As suitable candidates were not found in Bengal, 600 Punjabi Muslims were recruited from the Punjab. When the new recruits were given preferential treatment by the Muslim League government, the existing Gurkha policemen resented and the former engaged themselves in an armed conflict with the Gurkha policemen. 
The Muslim police used to enter Bengali Hindu households and molest women. On 12 April, the police entered a Bengali Hindu household in Manicktala and beat up the residents. One, Chhayalata Ghosh, who was pregnant at that time, was severely injured. News spread out that on 14 April another Bengali Hindu housewife was raped by the police. Another such incident which took place on 100, Harrison Road, grabbed the headlines for quite some time. The Calcutta Riot Enquiry Committee observed that the police used to arrest young Bengali Hindu boys, so as to prevent them from appearing before the Committee in order to provide evidence. The Deputy Police Commissioner of Kolkata, Shams-ud-Doha systematically arrested Hindu youths upon identification by one single Muslim. He believed he would teach Hindus a lesson that way. 
The Muslim League government imposed pre-censorship on news comments criticizing the police excesses. Through a special ordinance, the government imposed penalties on Hindu-owned media like Amrita Bazar Patrika, Hindustan Standard, Anandabazar Patrika and Modern Review and their security deposits confiscated.
In certain towns of eastern Bengal, Bengali Hindu girls, in order to defend themselves, began to carry sharp weapons resembling bagh nakh, hidden in their dresses, while going to school.
Mood of the Bengali Hindu people.
On 5 March, Kiran Shankar Roy met Fredrick Burrows, the then Governor of Bengal. When the latter asked Roy about the Bengali Hindu opinion on the question of a sovereign united Bengal, Roy summed up that the Bengali Hindu resentment towards the Muslim League government was so high that it was possible that they would build up a passive resistance to the move, refuse to pay taxes to the Muslim League government and set up parallel government of their own.
According to Sir Chandulal Tribedi, Hindus in Bengal didn't want an independent Bengal.
Campaign.
According to historian Amalendu De, the partition of Bengal was demanded for the first time by the Bengal Provincial Hindu Mahasabha during the Kolkata riots. But according to historian Dinesh Chandra Sinha, the West Bengal Provincial Committee was set up a few months before the Great Calcutta Killings, for the purpose of agitating for the partition of Bengal. 
Towards the end of 1946, the Bengal Partition League was formed by eminent Bengali Hindu intellectuals as an association for the partition of Bengal. The key people among them were Hemanta Kumar Sarkar, Nalinakshya Sanyal, Major General A. C. Chatterjee, Jadab Panja, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Upendranath Banerjee, Dr. Shishir Kumar Banerjee, Subhodh Chandra Mitra and Shailendra Kumar Ghosh. The Bengal Partition League later came to be known as the Bengal Provincial Conference. In February, the Bengal Provincial Hindu Mahasabha constituted a committee for the creation of a separate province for the Hindus of Bengal and began their campaign in the districts. On 29 March, at the annual meeting of the British Indian Association a proposal was passed for the constitution of a homeland for the Bengali Hindus. Maharaja Udaychand Mehtab of Burdwan, P.N.Sinha Ray, Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandy of Cossimbazar, Maharaja Prabendra Mohan Tagore, Maharaja Sitangshukanta Acharya Chaudhuri, Amulyadhan Auddy and Amarendra Narayan Roy were among the eminent persons who supported the move.
Political.
Early in February, the Bengal Hindu Sabha constituted a committee for the creation of a separate province for the Hindus of Bengal and began campaigning in the districts. In the first week of April, it convened a three day long Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeswar, starting 4th and attended by over 400 delegates from all over Bengal and over 50,000 people. On the first day of the conference, the working president Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee at his presidential address elaborated that the successful agitation against Curzon's Partition of Bengal has been the most glorious chapter in the history of Bengal. The British had resorted to the partition of the province in order to maim the Bengali Hindu people by making them minorities in both the provinces. In the same vein, the partition of India would cripple the Bengali Hindu people once again by disintegrating them from India, he continued. Therefore, in order to preserve the Bengali culture and heritage, it is necessary to carve out a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindu people and constitute it as a province within India. He further emphasized that it was a question of life or death for the Bengali Hindus. On 5 April, Syama Prasad, in his speech at the Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeshwar, suggested the partition of Bengal as the only solution to the communal problem. On the concluding day of the conference, the proposal of the partition was formally raised on behalf of the Bengal Hindu Sabha by Sanat Kumar Raychaudhuri and Surya Kumar Bose. At resolution was passed at the Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeswar, authorizing Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee to constitute a council of action in order to establish a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindus. It was decided that 100,000 volunteers would be enrolled for the purpose by the end of June. The Constituent Assembly was to be requested to appoint a boundary commission for the partition of the province.
On 4 April, the very day the Bengal Hindu Conference was under progress in Tarakeswar, the working committee of the Bengal Congress passed a resolution demanding the partition of Bengal. The meeting was attended by Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kshitish Chandra Niyogi, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, Dr. Pramathanath Banerjee, Debendra Lal Khan, Makhanlal Sen and Atul Chandra Gupta among others. After this, the Bengal Hindu Sabha and the Congress intensified their campaigns. No less than 76 Partition meetings were held, of which 59 were convened by the Congress, 12 by the Mahasabha and five jointly.
Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee further clarified that the movement for the partition of Bengal was not directly related to the partition of India. Even if Pakistan was not created, it was necessary to partition Bengal for the safety of the Bengali Hindu people and their culture. On 22 April, at a public rally in New Delhi, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee declared that even if the Muslim League accepts the Cabinet Mission plan, a separate province needs to be constituted in the Hindu majority areas of Bengal. Syama Prasad Mookerjee called a general strike in Bengal on 23 April demanding against the inclusion of the whole of Bengal into Pakistan. The strike was initially supported by the Communist Party of India. Later the tram workers union, owing affiliation to the CITU planned to defy the strike. When the news reached him, Syama Prasad Mookerjee himself toured the tram depots in person and successfully motivated the tram workers in favour of the strike.
The Bengal Provincial Depressed Classes League too supported the partition of Bengal. The BPDCL secretary R. Das clarified that the Jogendranath Mandal's views are not supported by the majority.
Media.
According to Dr. Dinesh Chandra Sinha, the Roy's Weekly suggested the division of Bengal to solve the communal problem for the first time. After that Professor Hemanta Kumar Sarkar wrote a series of articles in Dainik Basumati, a Bengali daily, proposing the creation of a separate province of West Bengal. After the Great Calcutta Killings in August, 1946, the correspondence columns of The Statesman and Amrita Bazar Patrika were opened to writers for and against the partition. In December, 1946, Prabasi, a Bengali weekly commented that, chances of reconciliation and co-operation between the two communities are slim. It is time for due consideration of the proposal for partition of Bengal. Sajanikanta Das, the editor of Shanibarer Chithi, a Bengali weekly noted that the Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement was being led by Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Major General A.C.Chatterjee and Dr. Pramathanath Banerjee, therefore one can be rest assured that they would leave no stone unturned to achieve it. In April, 1947, Sajanikanta Das opined in Shanibarer Chithi that it is in the best of interests to part ways. On 23 April, Amrita Bazar Patrika published an article titled, "Homeland for Bengali Hindus" where the results of a gallop poll were published. The survey revealed that an overwhelming 98.3% of the Bengali Hindus wanted the partition of Bengal and creation of a separate Bengali Hindu homeland. On 24 April, The Statesman commented that the resentment among the middle class Bengali Hindus towards the Muslim League government was so high that nothing less than Partition would satisfy them. Amrita Bazar Patrika subsequently constituted the Bengal Partition Fund, a public fund for the realization of the Bengali Hindu homeland.
Intellectuals.
On 15 March, Syama Prasad Mookerjee convened a meeting in Kolkata, attended by leading intellectuals like Dr. Ramesh Chandra Majumder, Dr. Makhanlal Raychaudhuri, Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay, Pandit Ramshankar Tripathi among others. At the meeting Shyama Prasad explained that, from the past experiences it is now clear that Hindus would not be able to live with honour and dignity in Pakistan. Therefore unless a homeland for the Bengali Hindus is carved out, they would not be able to seek proper rehabilitation. In his speech Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay seconded Shyama Prasad's proposal for a separate Bengali Hindu homeland. At the conference it was declared that out of 106 proposals received from the different parts of the province, only six were against the partition of the province, while the overwhelming 94.33% were for creation of homeland for the Bengali Hindu people. On 7 May, eminent Bengali Hindu intellectuals like Dr. Meghnad Saha, Dr. Jadunath Sarkar, Dr. Ramesh Chandra Majumder and Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay demanded a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindu people on the ground of security. In May, both the Hindu Mahasabha and Congress jointly convened a mammoth public meeting, presided over by historian Dr. Jadunath Sarkar, to press for Partition.
Judiciary.
The jurists of the Kolkata High Court realized the need for a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindus. Otherwise, they felt, the Bengali Hindus would only exchange one form of slavery for another. 50 jurists signed a statement demanding the partition of Bengal.
Lobbying.
On 1 April, 11 members of the Constituent Assembly from Bengal submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy, in support of the Partition. On 23 April, Syama Prasad Mookerjee met Viceroy Mountbatten and explained that if the Cabinet Mission plan failed and British India was to be partitioned, then Bengal should also be partitioned. On 26 April, both Kiran Shankar Roy and Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy assured Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, that they would convince the Congress Working Committee of the need of partition of Bengal. On 3 May, two Scheduled Caste representatives of the Constituent Assembly from eastern Bengal met Viceroy Mountbatten at a party and stated that the Scheduled Castes were determined not to be left under the brutal suppression and domination of Muslims. They firmly demanded the partition of Bengal and suggested that the seven million Scheduled Castes should be relocated in the proposed Bengali Hindu homeland in western Bengal.
Outside support.
On 30 April, the meeting of the Chambers of Commerce held at Kolkata lent the support for the Partition of Bengal. According to G.D.Birla, Partition was not only unavoidable, but an excellent way to solve the communal problem. The Muslim owned businesses too wanted Bengal to be partitioned because they wanted to free themselves from the unequal competition with the Tatas and the Birlas.

History of the Diablada

The Diablada or Danza de Diablos () is a dance created characterized by the mask and devil suit wore by the dancers. 
The origin of the "Diablada" is a matter of dispute between the countries of Bolivia and Peru. Three main locations exist for the possible origin of the dance. These places are:
Origin of the denomination.
The name was consolidated in a historical process of acceptance of the "Dance of devils" Native-Miners to the whole society of Oruro, this process covers the period from 1789 to 1944 where groups of "parades of devils" be called "Diablada." Finally in 1904 created the primeval "Diablada" with the label "The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro", with music, dress, choreography and plot defined. This period culminated with the founding of new groups of Diabladas in 1944, consolidating the denomination. Currently this definition is in the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language.
Origin of the dance.
Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of "Llama llama" dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. 
With the arrival of the Spanish in this region in 1535 and the Augustinians in 1559 with the Virgin of Candelaria, it begins to produce an acculturation of religions and cultures. 
Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent of Carnaval de Oruro to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco).
Native American roots.
The debate about the patrimonial identity of the "Diablada" concerns its roots as well. Chilean and Peruvian organizations suggest that since this dance is inspired in the Andean civilizations previous to the formation of the current national borders, it should belong equally to the three nations and other Andean states such as Argentina and Ecuador as well. Bolivian cultural organizations and government label this as an "unlawful cultural heritage appropriation" and consider that the declaration of the "Carnaval de Oruro" as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity gives Bolivia and the city of Oruro support on this claim. Bolivian scholars such as the professor of ethnomusicology and cultural heritage, Diego Echevers Tórrez, express that the "Diablada" is not the mere representation of the devils in a defined space, but constitutes the cultural heritage of the city of Oruro with specific actors and environment.
Aymaran roots theory.
The scholars who defend the theory of Juli (Peru) identify the roots of this dance with the Aymaran traditions of the Lupakas. Based on the written accounts of 16th-century historian and writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Lupaka natives of Juli in the year 1576 presented their version of the "Autos Sacramentales" taught to them by Spanish Jesuit priests. According to the director of the cultural group "Yuyachkani" of Peru, Miguel Rubio Zapata, the dance holds Native American roots from the cult of Anchanchu, a pre-Hispanic Aymara deity. Furthermore, rearchers Peter McFarren, Sixto Choque, and Teresa Gisbert state that the "Diablada" has roots to the Aymaran narrative of the "Myth of the Supaya".
Uru roots theory.
After the declaration of the "Carnaval de Oruro" as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 18 May 2001, the UNESCO delegated their ex-ambassador in Bolivia, Ivés de la Goublaye de Menorval, the task to be the moderator of the project and handed a form to the Bolivian authorities to be filled in coordination with historians and folklorists, such as Ramiro Condarco Morales, Mario Montaño Aragón, Fernando Cajías, Alberto Guerra Gutiérrez, Javier Romero, Elías Delgado, Carlos Condarco Santillán, Marcelo Lara, Zenobio Calizaya, Zulma Yugar, Walter Zambrana and Ascanio Nava.
The document elaborated by this group is based in the theory that the modern "Diablada" has roots in the ancient rituals performed 2000 years ago by the Uru civilization. The study makes reference to a deity named Tiw who was the protector of the Urus in mines, lakes and rivers and, in the case of Oruro (or "Uru-uru"), the owner of caves and rocky shelters. The Urus worship this deity with the "dance of the devils" being the "Tiw" himself the main character, later this name was hispanicized as "Tío" (), and as product of the syncretism, the "Tiw" represented the figure of the devil regretting and becoming devotee of the Virgin of Socavón.
During the times of the Tahuantinsuyu, the four administrative entities known as "suyus" had their own representative dances during the Ito festival, a festivity once celebrated throughout the entire empire but, according to the historian José Mansilla Vázquez, who based on manuscripts of Fray Martín de Murúa, says that these festivities were outlawed during the Viceroyalty of Peru with the exception of Oruro which, for being considered an important miner city in the 16th century, counted with some privileges and the Spanish authorities looked to the other way allowing this festivity persist in this city, adapting itself later into the Spanish traditions between the "Carnestolendas" and the "Corpus Christi" becoming into the Carnaval of Oruro over the centuries.
The ancient authors, Fray Martín de Murúa and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala make reference in their works to the different dances of the area, including the dance of the "Llama llama", name given by the Aymaras to refer to the Urus dressed as dancing demons, as it was recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. This dance was performed during the Ito festivities by the representatives of the region known as Urucolla, a sub-region of the south-eastern "suyu" of Collasuyu located in the lake system of the Department of Oruro between the basins of the lakes Poopó and Coipasa, where the Uru civilization had the city of Oruro as their main social centre, becoming together with Nazca and Wari one of the most ancient cities in the Andean world.
The supporters of this theory consider that the Uru mythology is reflected in the symbolism of the "Diablada". The legend behind the importance of the city of Oruro as an ancient sacred place for the Urus tells the story of the chthonic deity Wari, which in the Uru language means "soul" (). He, after hearing that the Urus were worshiping Pachacamaj, represented by Inti, unleashed his revenge by sending plagues of ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. But they were protected by the Ñusta who adopted the figure of a condor, defeating the creatures petrifying them and becoming sacred hills in the four cardinal points of the city of Oruro; these animals are also often represented in the traditional masks of the "Diablada".
Spanish influence.
One of the most referenced studies about the "Diablada" is the 1961 book of Julia Elena Fortún, "La danza de los diablos" (The dance of the devils), in which the theory of a relationship between this dance and a Catalonian dance named "Ball de diables", was suggested; more specifically with the elements used in the localities of Penedès and Tarragona. Julia Elena Fortún, unlike other historians in the Peruvian side, disagrees with the idea of considering the "Diablada" as a product of the introduction of the autos sacramentales in the Andes, because among the ones studied by her, the thematic of the devil and his temptations was not contemplated.
"Autos sacramentales" Theory.
In 2003, the newspaper Correo and José Morales Serruto, coordinator of cultural activities of the "Asociación Nativa Puno" (Native Association Puno), suggested that the dance of the "Diablada" was originated in the Peruvian city of Juli during a representation of the autos sacramentales in the year 1576 to the Aymaran kingdom of the Lupacas.
Historian Mercedes Serna observes that as soon as the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was achieved, there was a sudden increase in the amount of Autos Sacramentales presented in the Spanish colonies. Jose Miguel Oviedo records that by the year 1560 contests were held for religious theatrical presentations. This representation was documented in the 17th century book "Comentarios Reales" of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega where it reads:
Garcilaso de la Vega further mentions that the Jesuit priests taught the "Auto Sacramental" comedy by writing it in Aymara, and the natives of Juli later presented their version of the religious dance to the priests and, later, presented a dialogue to the rest of the Spanish population in such a way that it “changed the opinion that up to that point had regarded the natives as being dumb, rude, or incapable.” 
This same information is used by other authors, such as the Peruvian scholar Nicomedes Santa Cruz and the Bolivian anthropologist Freddy Arancibia Andrade, to suggest that the Spanish influence was spread to Oruro from the southern Bolivian region of Potosí. Andrade considers that the "Diablada" recovers the steps of rebellion and combat of the ritual of Tinku mixed with the biblic vision introduced by the Spanish conquerors in the miner region of Aullagas starting in the year 1538. 
Another piece of information collected by Andrade is that in 1780 the army of Tomás Katari wore demon suits to attack the towns of Macha, Pocoata, Colquechaca, Aullagas and San Pedro de Buena Vista, giving more strength to the syncretism and represents the appearance of the tinku-devil. After the silver era in Bolivia, the miners went to Uncía to work for the tin company of Simón Iturri Patiño and during the Bolivian federal war, the miners migrated to Oruro where in 1904 they were allowed to dance for the Virgin of Socavón.
"Ball de diables" theory.
The "Ball de diables" has origins in a 12th-century entremés representing the struggle between the good and the evil where the figure of the archangel Saint Michael and his angels battled the forces of evil represented by Lucifer and his demons. This act was performed in the wedding banquet of the Barcelona count, Ramón Berenguer IV with the princess Petronila, daughter of the king of Aragón and Catalonia in the year 1150.
In a study presented in 2005 by the Catalonian scholar Jordi Rius i Mercade, member of the "Ball de Sant Miquel i Diables de la Riera" (board of the "Ball de diables" in Spain) and editor in chief of the specialized magazine "El Dragabales" during the Symposium of the Catalonian Discovery of America, states that the traditional dances and short plays performed during the celebration of Corpus Christi in Spain were adopted by the Christian church to teach their doctrines to the native Americans; their festivities were readapted to the new calendar and their deities were redefined acquiring demoniac forms representing the evil fighting against the divine power. According to Rius i Mercade, the "Ball de diables" was the most suitable for this purpose. In this study, he identifies three Latin American dances that contain similar elements to the Catalonian "Ball de diables"; the "Diablada" of Oruro, "Baile de Diablos de Cobán" in Guatemala and "Danza de los diablicos de Túcume" in Peru.
The "Diablada" of Oruro represents the tale of the struggle between the archangel Saint Michael and Lucifer, the she-devil China Supay and devils accompanying them. Ruis i Mercade suggests that this was a tale presented by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre of the city of Oruro in 1818 inspired in the Catalonian "Ball de diables".
Colonial history.
During the colonial times in the region, from the 15th century till the first half of the 19th century, the ancient Andean beliefs were blended with the new Christian traditions. The traditions adopted new iconography and the celebrations adopted a new meaning during the Latin American wars of independence.
From the worship of the Sun to the Virgin of Candlemas.
With the advent of the Inca state religion the inhabitants of the Island of the Sun () were replaced by ministers in worship of the sun (Inti) and the city of Copacabana located in the Bolivian side of the Lake Titicaca had been repopulated by forty-two different nations of mitimaes and became one of the most important landmarks for the constant pilgrimage to the sanctuary; with the migration, two social classes were created in this area, the newcomers became "Anansaya" (upper) and the indigenous people "Urinsaya" (lower).
The selection of the Virgin of the Candlemas as the patroness of Copacabana was a sign of the power structures established by the Incas in the area. In the year 1582 a frost threatened to destroy the crops, and the inhabitants decided to build an altar to a Christian figure, but there was a dispute because the "Anansayas" insisted to use the Virgin of the Candlemas since Francisco Tito Yupanqui had already sculpted her image while the "Urinsayas" wanted it use the image of Saint Bartholomew instead. But the "Anansayas"' wishes were imposed in the enthronement of the Virgin of Copacabana and the foundation of a brotherhood.
Independence and the transition to the Carnival.
The cult of the Virgin of the Candlemas, was then spread throughout the Andes reaching, Oruro and to the west to Puno. In Oruro there is a Sanctuary in honour of the Virgin of Socavón (or Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Mineshaft) who was originally the Virgin of Candlemas traditionally honoured on 2 February, like in Puno, but later the date was moved to Carnival; this transition is product of the Bolivian War of Independence.
There is a legend that says that on the Saturday of Carnival in 1789 a bandit known as "Nina-Nina" or "Chiru-Chiru" was mortally wounded in a street fight and before dying he was confronted by the Virgin of the Candlemas. Some versions state that he used to worship a life-size image of the Virgin painted in a wall of a deserted house, some say that the painting miraculously appeared on the wall of the bandit's own house after his death. And the legend is concluded with the tale of the troupe of devils dancing in honour of the Virgin in the next year's Carnival. The present sanctuary in Oruro was completed in 1891.
However according to the Ph D in religious studies and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Humanities Council at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Max Harris, this legend is related to a historical reality. During the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II, which started in Cusco and spread along the Andean highlands, Oruro experienced a brief but bloody revolution as well. Pushed by the fear of being target of the indigenous revolution, the majority Creole on the night of Saturday, 10 February 1781, attacked the minority ruling class of the peninsular-born Spaniards () . With the arrival of the Indigenous army the Creoles made an alliance.
On 15 February, a messenger arrived in Oruro with orders from Túpac Amaru II. He instructed his army to respect churches and clergy, to do no harm to Creoles, and to prosecute none but "chapetones". And assured the victory by entering in La Paz "by Carnival ("por Carnestolendas")", the Indigenous occupation of Oruro started to retreat leaving several thousands of deaths. But during March and April they launched more attacks to the city this time against the Creoles and the remaining Spaniards who unified forces to repel them. 
Harris observes that the Carnival of the year of 1781, fell on 24 February, placing Oruro's occupation exactly halfway between "Candlemas" and Carnival, making the situation in Oruro in Harris' words, "carnivalesque". Religious processions duelled with secular parades. Europeans and Creoles disguised as Indigenous, cases like a Spaniard resorting to cross-dressing tin a vain attempt to save his life and thousands of armed men in the streets of the colonial city. By 19 February people in the city regardless of the conflict continued celebrating and, throughout Carnival, the city markets were full of robbers selling the looted gold and silver back to its owners or to "cholos" and mestizos. By 1784 it was customary to rejoice, dance, play, and form "comparsas" (companies of masqueraders) for the Carnival in Oruro.
Harris considers that with this background is that the legend of the Virgin of the Mineshaft in 1789 appeared favouring the rebellion as they worshiped the Virgin of Candlemas while the "chapetones" used to worship the Virgin of the Rosary. Under the beliefs of the revolutionaries, the Virgin of the Socavón tolerated the indigenous deities or "devils" and, according to Harris, if the legend is correct, by 1790, Oruro's miners had moved Candlemas to Carnival and added indigenous gods, masked as Christian devils, to the festivities.
In 1818, Oruro's parish priest, Ladislao Montealegre, wrote the play "Narrative of the seven deadly sins", where according to Harris and Fortún, borrowed elements of the Catalonian "Ball de diables" like the female devil, "Diablesa" in the Catalonian dance and "China supay" in the Diablada and where the Devil leads the Seven Deadly Sins into battle against the opposing Virtues and an angel. Harris suggests that Montealegre may have wanted to represent the threat of rebellion and the historical context with this play.
A generation later, in 1825 after Bolivia achieved its independence, the "Diablada" and the Carnival adopted a new meaning for Oruro's residents. Two of the "Diablada" dance squads and the street from where the parade starts are named after Sebastian Pagador, one of the Creole heroes of the uprising. And the main square which is in the route of the Carnival to the Virgin of the Mineshaft temple is named "Plaza 10 de febrero" (10 February square) remembering the date of the uprising.

1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand

Despite the selection of several Welsh players in the touring squad, the team is sometimes referred to as "England". They went south From Manchester in early April to London, then travelled by ship for six weeks before reaching Australia. Led by Salford captain James Lomas, the tour was a huge success for the Lions who won all their test matches with Lomas topping the tour scoring charts with 136 points in 13 games.
Touring squad.
The team originally scheduled to tour consisted of eighteen internationals: nine English, eight Welsh and one Scottish. All players were from clubs that participated in the 1909–10 Northern Rugby Football Union season's Championship. The players were also accompanied by joint managers, J. H. Houghton and J. Clifford as well as trainer D. Murray.
Australian leg.
The Australian leg of the tour took place during the 1910 NSWRFL season, the third season of rugby league football in Australia since the game's split from rugby union.
Versus New South Wales.
Before the test series, the British played three matches against New South Wales, losing the first 14 – 28 and the second 20 – 27.
10,000 people saw the match on 29 May whose margin never went beyond more than five points.
This was the third match and first win of the visitors' series against New South Wales, with their captain, Jim Lomas featuring prominently.
Ashes series.
Sydney's Royal Agricultural Showground was the venue for the first Ashes test on Australian soil. Five former Wallaby team mates made their rugby league test debuts for Australia in this match: Charles Russell, John Barnett, Bob Craig, Jack Hickey, and Chris McKivat. 
This day also featured a goal-kicking contest between the two sides' captains, Dally Messenger and Jim Lomas.
This match also featured a goal-kicking contest, between Dally Messenger, Jim Lomas and Herb Brackenrigg, which the latter won.
Queensland's Bill Heidke was awarded the captaincy for this match, the first non-New South Welshman to achieve this honour.
In the second test, Australia had gotten off to an early lead over the visitors at 11 nil. Jim Leytham's four tries in this match would remain an unbeaten Ashes record.
The British had thus won the series in two tests.
Versus Australasia.
It was decided that after the Ashes series, a combined "Australasia" team, comprising the best players of Australia and New Zealand would play a series of matches against the touring Britons. The Australian jersey's sky blue with maroon hoops had black hoops added to it for these matches.
The British team were conveyed on to the ground by a group of "Jack tars" in port at Sydney who took the place of the horses that were to pull the drag.
The first points came from an individual effort from Viv Farnsworth that led to him scoring in the corner. Great Britain replied with a penalty goal through Jim Lomas. Courtney got the next try, which Brackenrigg failed to convert. Then it was the visitors' turn to score, with a try to Leytham out wide. Lomas missed the kick, so Australasia were leading 8 – 5 at the half time break. They extended their lead to 13 – 5 before The British made a strong comeback to level the scores with a late try before full-time.
At one stage Great Britain were leading 15 – 5 but at half time were trailing 15 – 17. They scored no more points in the second half, as Australasia overran them.
In the evening following the match, the touring Britons left for New Zealand on the "Maheno". The next time the two sides would meet was during the 1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain.
New Zealand leg.
The British team arrived in Auckland on 17 July and were met by officials of the newly formed New Zealand Rugby League before being given a mayoral reception the following morning. New Zealand wore the colours of Red and Yellow with Black bands for the Test match. It was the only time that they wore these colours.
The first match was played in weather described as atrocious against a New Zealand Māori team captained by Whiri Winiata and featuring Albert Asher who had played with the victorious Australasia team back in Australia.
The first international try scored on New Zealand soil was by Halifax winger, Joe Riley and this was followed by a hat-trick of tries by Wigan centre Bert Jenkins. Great Britain led 23 – 0 at half-time. In the second half, Fred Smith scored a fourth try for the visitors.
The Auckland side was; Alf Chorley, L Nolan, G Smith, Albert Asher, Alf Jackson, Ronald MacDonald, Len Farrant, Fred Jackson (c), Charles Dunning, Jim Griffin, Alex Stanaway, H Fricker, George Seagar. Emergencies; Syd Riley, Arthur Carlaw, J Bennett, Jim Rukutai, Bob Mitchell.
The New Zealand side was; Alf Chorley, Albert Asher, Ernier Asher, Charles James, Ernie Buckland, Frank Woodward, Ronald MacDonald, Fred Jackson, Pat Hannigan, Jim Griffen, Charles Dunning, Ned Hughes and George Seagar.
The touring side had been invited to play another match in Australia, so left Auckland for Sydney on 1 August on the "SS Maheno" after a hearty send-off. During the tour the Lions donated the Northern Union Cup which was awarded to Auckland for inter-provincial competition and is still contested today.
Return leg.
On their way back to England, a portion of the touring Britons stopped in Sydney for one more game against a New South Wales second XIII, as there was already a New South Wales team playing against Queensland in Brisbane.

<doc id="31168275" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31168275" title="The Murder of Biggie Smalls">
The Murder of Biggie Smalls

The Murder of Biggie Smalls is a non-fiction true crime book by author and journalist Cathy Scott. Published in October 2000 by St. Martin's Press, it covers the March 9, 1997, murder in a drive-by shooting of the late rapper Christopher Wallace (a k a Biggie Smalls, The Notorious B.I.G. and Big Poppa).
Background.
The book includes a chapter about accusations from fellow rapper Tupac Shakur, that Biggie, 24, and his producer, Sean "Diddy" Combs, were responsible for Tupac being injured during a 1994 shooting at New York City's Quad Studios, where Biggie was recording that same night. Smalls denied the accusation, as did Combs, and no arrests were ever made in the case. In September 1996, Shakur, 25, was shot a second time, this time in Las Vegas. Shakur died six days later. That murder, too, remains unsolved, which Scott covered in "The Killing of Tupac Shakur".
In what was promoted as a Sunday series with "exclusive information" in the "Los Angeles Times", the article quoted a single source saying Biggie Smalls had been in Las Vegas the night Shakur was murdered and that Smalls had paid for and ordered the hit against Shakur. When Voletta Wallace, Smalls' mother, gave proof to the "Times" that her son had, in fact, been in a New York studio recording music the night Shakur was shot, the newspaper retracted the story and ultimately removed it from its website. Scott commented on the article in a "Las Vegas CityLife" column. "Wallace was a rapper, not a killer," she wrote. "He was an only child who attended private Catholic school and was raised by an over-protective single mom. While Wallace spewed violence in his songs, he wasn't a street thug like Shakur."
"People" magazine interviewed Scott about the claim, quoting her as saying, "It's easy to point a finger at a dead guy. The dead can't sue." TruTV's "Crime Library" quoted one possible scenario from the book that Combs could have been responsible for Smalls' death because "dead stars sell records without the bothersome upkeep."
An earlier article in the "L.A. Times", which accused Tupac's music producer, Suge Knight, and a rogue Los Angeles Police Department officer as also being involved in Smalls' murder, the informant for the article recanted his claims and described himself to the "Times" as "a paranoid schizophrenic."
Based upon the newspaper's earlier accusations against her son, Voletta Wallace filed suit against the City of Los Angeles and the LAPD in a wrongful death suit accusing police of taking part in a conspiracy to kill her son. She lost the suit when, in April 2010, a judge dismissed the claim. The civil suit, along with LAPD's internal investigation, are included in "The Murder of Biggie Smalls".
In January 2011, Anderson Cooper AC360 reported that a new task force, composed of law enforcement officers based in the Los Angeles area, was taking a fresh look at the Smalls murder case, interviewing author Scott for AC360's blog about the probe that is said to also be looking into Shakur's murder.
The book was optioned in 2000 for a feature film, "Record Wars", by Jonathan Sheinberg's development and production company The Machine.
Reception.
According to "Booklist" magazine's Mike Tribby in his October 2000 review, "Whereas others who have dealt with this stuff have often neglected to humanize the principals involved, Scott points up biographical details that bring them into focus as human beings. For setting the record straight as well as for limning a major pop music star, this is a valuable book."
The editors at Barnes & Noble wrote that "the fatal shooting of rapper Notorious B.I.G. remains shrouded in a blanket of mystery, speculation, and grief, while his popularity is as strong as ever. Cathy Scott's "The Murder of Biggie Smalls" is an engrossing examination of the death of the beloved Big Poppa and the resulting investigation, which finally seems to be nearing a conclusion."
Nelson George with "Africana-Magazine" also reviewed the book, noting, "The picture painted of the investigation of Biggie's murder is more detailed than anything found in the music press. In 2000, "The Murder of Biggie Smalls" made Library Booklist's "Realistic and Urban Fiction" for teens.
The New York Post ran an excerpt upon the book's 2000 release.
Book editions.
"The Murder of Biggie Smalls" has been reprinted in the UK by Plexus Publishing, a music genre publisher. It has also been made into a talking book, read by narrator Bob Moore.

Air Observation Post

Air Observation Post (AOP) is the term used by the Royal Air Force and other services of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth air forces for an aeroplane or helicopter used in the role of artillery spotter. In this role, either the pilot of the aircraft or a passenger acts both just as an observer watching for targets on the ground, and as a Forward Observation Officer directing the fire, by radio, of artillery on the ground (or calling in tactical ground-attack aircraft).
In the interwar period the role of artillery spotting was mixed with reconnaissance and ground attack to be served by Army Co-operation (AC) squadrons. At the beginning of World War II their standard aircraft was the Westland Lysander. The enormous losses of the British Expeditionary Force showed both the aircraft and the concept to be a failure, and around 1941 AC squadrons were converted to fighter-bomber aircraft, dropping the liaison and artillery spotting roles. These roles have been take over by numbers 651 to 663 Squadrons of the RAF, the all-new Air Observation Post units working closely with Army. A further three of these squadrons - Nos. 664, 665 and 666 - were RCAF AOP squadrons manned by Canadian and British personnel.
For the remainder of the World War II, AOP units used light, fixed-wing aircraft, notably several marks of Auster aircraft, flown by RAF or British Army pilots. In 1957, the newly formed Army Air Corps took over the role, aeroplanes eventually being replaced by helicopters.

Jim A. Matthews

James "Jim" Matthews (7 November 1919 - 1999) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was also a tennis player and competed in the 1947 Australian Championships.
Matthews grew up in the New South Wales town of Culcairn but moved to Albury in 1935 to work as a sporting goods salesman.
In 1942 he played six VFL games with St Kilda, all in successive rounds.
He joined the Army in 1943 and served with the 22nd Australian Field Regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery.
Back at Albury after the war, Matthews was making a name for himself on the local tennis scene and entered the Australian Championships in 1947. He made the second round of the Men's Singles, beating William Edwards. He was then eliminated 6–1, 10–8, 6–2, by Adrian Quist. He also competed in the doubles, with Max Bonner, but they were knocked out in the first round by third seeds Tom Brown and Bill Sidwell.
One of his best achievements in tennis was winning the Men's Country Championship Singles event on three occasions, in 1950, 1953 and 1954. He also had the distinction of touring New Zealand with a NSW representative team.
As a footballer post-war, he was also a New South Wales representative. He is regarded as having been his state's best performer at the 1947 Hobart Carnival, where he played as a centreman. At club level he turned out for Albury, in the Ovens & Murray Football League. He captained-coach Albury to a grand final in 1953 but they lost to Benalla. Often seen at centre half-forward, he was the league's leading goal-kicker in 1953 and won four Albury "Best and Fairest" awards, a club record.

The Church of the Good Shepherd in Phillipstown, Christchurch, New Zealand was the oldest and last surviving brick church designed by architect Benjamin Mountfort (1825–1898). It was registered as a "Historic Place – Category I" by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
History.
The vicar of Phillipstown, Rev Hannibal James Congdon Gilbert, teamed up with an accountant (James Bowlker) and a storeman (Lewis Aylwin Carrell) to purchase the land for the church for £380 in September 1881. They onsold the Church Property Trustees for a nominal ten shillings in March 1883. The church, constructed in 1885, was designed in the Gothic Revival style with red brick with contrasting bands of stone, reflecting contemporary English architectural style A similarly detailed but larger church, St Johns Cathedral, was designed by Mountfort and built in Napier between 1886 and 1888. This was destroyed by the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake and thus left the Church of the Good Shepherd as Mounfort's only surviving brick church.
Mountfort's son Cyril oversaw the extension of the church in 1906/07.
During an earthquake in September 2010, the church suffered slight damage to its gables. Later that month, the church suffered significant damage to its interior due to vandalism. Major structural damage was caused the following February during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It was added to the list of demolitions by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority later that year and has since been demolished.
Heritage listing.
On 2 April 1985, the church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 1855. It was significant as it was Mountfort's only surviving brick church.

Cape Romanzof Air Force Station

Cape Romanzof Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-06, LRR ID: A-10) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located west-southwest of Scammon Bay, Alaska. 
The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was redesignated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.
History.
Cape Romanzof AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. 
Contracts were awarded during the spring of 1950, and work was started shortly afterwards on construction. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project, code name Mona Lisa, of getting the initial supplies and equipment to the construction site. The only means of getting construction materials and supplies to the site was by barge or Navy LSTs, however this was restricted to when the sea was not frozen and had to be unloaded 15 miles from the proposed site. Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort. Each item had to be hauled along the beach to the area nearest the construction site, then an additional five miles inland to the permanent storage area.
The station was opened in April 1953 as a general radar surveillance station, operated by the 795th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W Sq). The station had its main camp in a valley between peaks of the Azkinuk Mountains at the 1,500-foot level , and a landing strip near sea level, , east-northeast. Recreational features included hobby shops and recreation rooms, plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The radars were located on a mountain peak at 2,300 feet. 
The inaccessibility made the personnel at the site responsible for maintenance if anything went wrong. Water mains occasionally froze and ruptured. The station had a tramway connecting the base camp with the radars located on top of the mountain. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter.
Cape Romanzof provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at King Salmon AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Radars operated at the station were AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20A, AN/FPS-93 and an AN/FPS-87A. 
Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Cape Romanzof site was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm.
Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Cape Romanzof received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's Seek Igloo program . It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. 
No longer needed, the 795th AC&W Sq was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Cape Romanzof LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the redesignation of AAC.
In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated "Operation Clean Sweep", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Today very little of the former Cape Romanzof Air Force Station remains.
Current status.
Today the site is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is generally unattended; a few civilian contractors access the site by the Cape Romanzof LRRS Airport and provide maintenance and support when needed to maintain the radar system.

Grand Junction Railroad Bridge

The Grand Junction Railroad Bridge is a steel truss bridge carrying the Grand Junction Railroad over the Charles River, connecting Boston to Cambridge, Massachusetts. In September 2009, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts finalized an agreement to purchase several CSX rail lines in eastern Massachusetts, including the Grand Junction tracks from the Beacon Park Yard in Allston, through Cambridge. The deal was closed on June 17, 2010.
On November 21, 2012, the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge was closed to all rail traffic due to its poor condition. This was a change from a restriction put in place days earlier, on November 16, which barred freight trains from crossing, as well as restricting MBTA and Amtrak equipment moves to 5 MPH. While emergency repairs were under way, trains moving between the north and south sides of Boston had to be routed via Pan Am Railways trackage between Ayer, Massachusetts and Worcester, Massachusetts (a 100+ mile detour). The bridge reopened in early January 2013, but was closed again in March for major structural repairs, reopening again in June.

Joseph Barss (ice hockey)

Joseph Ernest Barss (February 27, 1892 – January 26, 1971) was an ice hockey player and coach. He was the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team, holding the position from 1922 to 1927. He was later employed as a medical doctor and surgeon in the Chicago area.
Early years.
Barss was born in Madras, India (now known as Chennai) in February 1892. His father, John Howard Barss (born Wolfville, Nova Scotia) was ordained in July 1891 and traveled to India as a Baptist missionary. In 1893, while still an infant, Barss returned to Canada with his parents. He traveled with his parents from Liverpool, England, arriving in New York on October 30, 1893. They returned to their home in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, where Barss' father operated a grocery store and served as a Baptist minister. Barss was enrolled at Acadia University in Wolfville, receiving his degree in 1912. After graduating from Acadia, Barss played professional hockey for the Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association.
World War I.
In April 1915, Barss entered the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of World War I. At that time, he listed his occupation as clerk and indicated that he had three years of prior military service. In his history of the University of Michigan's hockey program, author John U. Bacon provides a lengthy account of Barss' war-time service and its impact on his decision to become a medical doctor. According to Bacon, Barss was wounded by shrapnel and gassed at the Second Battle of Ypres in April and May 1915. However, Barss' military records indicate that Barss' Attestation Paper for the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force was completed on April 30, 1915 in Montreal. Accordingly, it appears that Barss likely did not see combat action at the Second Battle of Ypres. Barss' Service Record states that he was wounded on June 2, 1916. He was a machine gunner sergeant with the P.P.C.L.I and badly wounded in Sanctuary Wood during the first day of the Battle of Mt. Sorrel on the eastern border of Ypres, Belgium. According to Bacon, Barss suffered permanent lung damage and a severe abdomenal injury from shrapnel while serving in Belgium. After a lengthy hospitalization in France, Barss was sent to Camp Hill Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia in November 1917. Barss arrived in Halifax weeks before the Halifax Explosion, an explosion of a ship in Halifax harbor loaded with 10 tons of gun power, 35 tons of airplane fuel and 200 tons of TNT. More than 1,700 persons were killed in the explosion. Barss was not injured in the explosion and helped tend to the injured in the aftermath of the disaster.
University of Michigan.
In 1919, Barss enrolled at the University of Michigan as a graduate student in bacteriology. In 1920, he enrolled at the Medical School, receiving a medical degree from the university in 1924.
While attending medical school at Michigan, Barss also served as the first coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team. According to Wilfred Byron Shaw's four-volume history of the University of Michigan, hockey had its beginning at Michigan in 1921 with Barss as the coach. Other sources indicate that Barss became the coach of the Michigan hockey team in 1922. According to Bacon, Barss officiated many of the games for the 1922 team and then asked athletic director Fielding H. Yost if he could start a varsity hockey team. Bacon wrote that Yost "might not have known much about hockey, but he knew a natural coach when he met one" and accepted Barss' offer.
It was not until 1923 that the Michigan hockey team received formal recognition as a varsity sport. The first "official" college hockey game played west of the Alleghenies was a game between Michigan and Wisconsin, played on January 12, 1923, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The game went into overtime with Michigan prevailing by a score of 2-1.
Barss coached the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team during its first five years as a formal varsity sport. During those five years (1923 to 1927), the Michigan hockey team compiled a record of 26-21-4.
As the popularity of college hockey grew in the early 1920s, other colleges looked to Barss' pupils for coaching candidates. In January 1923, former Michigan hockey star Russell Barkell was hired as the coach of the hockey team at Williams College.
In February 1924, after a 3-0 victory by Michigan over Wisconsin, a Madison newspaper praised the defensive play of the Barss-coached Wolverines: "With an almost air-tight defense and a definite scoring attack the Michigan hockey team defeated the Badger six by a score of 3 to 0 yesterday afternoon. Wisconsin could not stop Michigan's fast team work and was unable to penetrate their defense to take any close shots at the goal."
By January 1925, the Michigan ice hockey team had four returning letter men from the prior year's team, and a call for candidates by Coach Barss "brought out 20 aspirants."
Medical career.
After retiring as Michigan's hockey coach in 1927, Barss moved to Riverside, Illinois. He worked at the Hines Veteran Hospital in Maywood, Illinois, eventually becoming the chief of surgery there. In June 1930, Barss became a naturalized United States citizen. That same year, U.S. Census records show that Barss was living in Riverside, Illinois with his wife, Helen Kolb Barss, and two children, Joseph (age 6) and Elizabeth (age 2). In his registration card for the draft at the time of World War II, Barss indicated that he was a physician and surgeon residing in Riverside and having his place of business at 1011 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois.
Later years and death.
Barss retired from his medical practice in 1962 and moved to Florida. In 1971, Barss died of Alzheimer's disease in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at age 79.

People on Vacation

People on Vacation (often abbreviated as POV) is a supergroup composed of Ryan Hamilton from the indie rock band Smile Smile and Jaret Reddick from the pop punk band Bowling for Soup. The duo's concept is to 'tell a story' and to 'avoid typical topics such as relationships.' The duo describe their genre as indie rock.
History.
2010–present: Formation and debut releases.
Ryan Hamilton and Jaret Reddick decided to start writing songs together after Hamilton's band, Smile Smile, opened for Reddick's band, Bowling for Soup, on a few of their tour dates. After four days of writing, the duo had written six songs, which later resulted in the formation of the band People on Vacation. The band began streaming a song titled, "Better Off Dead," on their official site in late 2010. During his eleventh Bowling for Soup podcast regarding the band's newly announced side projects, Reddick played a demo that he described as "the first People on Vacation song," titled "Rainy Day." The band has since announced they have written and recorded fifteen songs and plans to release album in Fall 2011, through Kirtland Records. The band released another song, titled "She Was the Only One," as a free download via Twitter as a "Tweet for a Track" promotion, in addition to streaming it on their official site in January 2011. The band's music video for "Better Off Dead" premiered on the Dallas Observer website on January 19, 2011. In an interview with aduioADD, Hamilton jokingly named the album "Buskin' & Name Droppin. Another song "Because of the Sun" was played live on 102.1 FM for the first time in March 2011. In order to promote the project, the band joined Bowling for Soup's 2011 UK Acoustic Tour as an opening act, alongside Linus of Hollywood and Erik Chandler and the Mulberry Street Socialites.

Witlin's career began while a senior at Lehigh University. He co-founded a custom software development company called Lever Works with Keith Schacht and Zach Kaplan. In December 2001 Lever Works was sold to Leo Media for an undisclosed sum.
While completing his Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and Design at the Stanford University School of Engineering, Witlin Co-Founded RootPhi, a new product development incubator with partner Doug Patt. The company's success and approach to portfolio innovation garnered media attention for Witlin. On September 4, 2007, while in partnership with Timbuk2 making limited edition messenger bags out of RootPhi's Reclaim Brand recycled fabric, Timbuk2 and RootPhi received a Cease and Desist letter from TARGET for using the bullseye logo within the Reclaim fabric. This fabric was utilized in a line of limited edition messenger bags manufactured by Timbuk2 (Lamitron Bags). This move by TARGET halted production of the recycled bags angering many and sparking controversy around copyright law and recycled and repurposed materials. Although the collaboration with Timbuk2 ended prematurely, RootPhi was able to successfully sell another of their incubated companies, GoLaces, LLC, a footwear accessory business to a publicly traded footwear company for an undisclosed amount in February 2008.

Sportavia-Pützer SFS 31 Milan

__NOTOC__
The Sportavia-Pützer SFS 31 Milan is a single-seat motor glider that was produced in Germany in the early 1970s.
The Milan was created by essentially combining the fuselage of the Fournier RF-4 with the wings of the Scheibe SF-27. The resulting aircraft is a conventional motorglider design, a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a nose-mounted engine. The undercarriage consists of a single retractable mainwheel, a fixed tailwheel, and an outrigger under each wing. Construction is of wood, skinned in plywood and fabric. The designation was created by combining the initials of the manufacturers involved (Sportavia, Fournier, and Scheibe), and adding together the model numbers of the two constituent aircraft designs.
The SFS 31 prototype (registered "D-KORO") first flew on 31 August 1969 and soon replaced the RF-4D in production at Sportavia-Pützer. In 1971, Hans Huth piloted an SFS 31 to third place in the German national motorglider competition.

Scooters Union

Scooters Union were a rock band from Durban, South Africa. They released one album, Vivid Memories of Static, which was nominated for two South African Music Awards, and they also produced two hits, 'Blue Man In A Bulldozer,' and 'Brave Heart.'
The band had a turbulent beginning, playing small shows in bars, to be cut short when frontman Rhys Johnstone headed overseas. He was frustrated by their lack of progress in a culture dismissive of local music. The guitarist persuaded him to return a few years later, and the band went on to play sold-out shows. They appeared alongside such acts as the Spin Doctors, Tracy Chapman, and Crowded House. The band were described as regulars at festivals, including Splashy Fen, Oppikoppi, and The National Festival of the Arts. Their single, "Blue Man In A Bulldozer," received national airplay.
Their sound is described as a blend of rock, pop, Cajun, and African. Reviewer Kurt Shoemaker describes their album as 'a gem,' containing rock with beautiful vocal harmonies, some 'classic' country music, Avant-garde, and an instrumental accordion track.
Articles indicate the band has disbanded and at least one member has moved on to other projects.

Charles Ashpitel Denton

Charles Ashpitel Denton (24 October 1852 – 28 September 1932) was an English amateur footballer who twice won the FA Cup with Wanderers. In his professional life, he was a solicitor.
Family and education.
Denton was born at St. Bartholomew's Vicarage in Moor Lane, Cripplegate in the City of London; his father was vicar of St. Bartholomew's Church. He was educated at Bradfield College between 1862 and 1872 before going up to Trinity College at the University of Oxford. He graduated in 1876 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.
He had a daughter, Edith Jane, who married Hubert Francis Burke (1880–1956). Burke was a member of the Royal Artillery who attained the rank of Colonel and served with distinction in the First World War, being decorated with the Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) and the Croix de Guerre.
Football career.
Denton was a member of the Bradfield College football XI from 1869 to 1872, being captain in his final year. He also played for Oxford University, Swifts and Wanderers and was later a member of the Casuals club.
He made his debut for the Wanderers on 13 January 1872 and then played the occasional match over the next few years. It was only in the 1876–77 season that he began to play regularly, helping the Wanderers reach the Cup Final against Oxford University. The Wanderers were victorious by a 2–1 margin after extra time.
In 1877–78, Denton was virtually ever-present making 14 appearances, scoring eight goals as Wanderers again reached the FA Cup Final, this time against the Royal Engineers. The 1878 FA Cup Final was their fifth appearance in the seven years since the tournament was inaugurated. With Denton making "some fine runs" on the left wing, the Wanderers were again victorious, thus taking the trophy for the fifth and final time.
Denton was described in the 1878 "Football Annual" as "a fast wing player did good service for the Wanderers in some of the cup ties; not a good shot at goal". He was one of the few players to appear regularly for the Wanderers after 1878 as the club gradually declined. By the time that he played his last match in February 1880, Denton had made 41 appearances with 12 goals.
Professional career.
Denton qualified as a solicitor in 1880 and later became assistant secretary of the Union Bank of London. In 1891, he was appointed Secretary of the London Assurance Corporation based at the Royal Exchange. He retired in 1921.
Denton was also a keen cricketer and played for Bradfield College from 1870 to 1872 and was a member of the M.C.C.
Denton died on 28 September 1932 at the Grand Hotel, Folkestone. At the time of his death he was resident at Grosvenor Place, Westminster.

Sidney Nelson Crowther

Sidney Crowther (1875–1914) was a rugby union international who represented Great Britain on the 1904 tour to Australia and New Zealand.
Early life.
Sidney Crowther was born in the early part of 1875 in Keston, Kent and grew up at Holly Lodge. He was the son of Alfred H. Crowther, a solicitor, of Gray's Inn and Mary Crowther. He had a number of siblings, including Julia (b. c1866); Nelson (b. c 1872); Keston (b. c. 1874); and Bertrand (b. c 1877). Sidney attended Warwick School, and in fact was the first Old Warwickian to gain international honours for Great Britain, when he later went on a tour to Australia and New Zealand. In the same school rugby side as Sidney was Robert Challoner who emigrated to Australia and represented New South Wales and later Australia in the second test against a touring Great Britain side in 1899.
Rugby union career.
Crowther played rugby at Warwick School, and in fact played alongside the Australian international to be, Robert Challoner. He then went to Westminster Hospital that by the time of his arrival had a distinguished rugby union playing record being one of the teams competing for the United Hospitals Cup. Whilst in London he also played for Lennox FC, then a club that had some measure of prominence having won the inaugural Surrey Cup in 1891. 
Crowther was selected for the 1904 tour of the British Isles to Australia and New Zealand. He played in all four Test Matches, three against Australia and the final Test against New Zealand. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match. When the touring British team returned home after the 1904 campaign, Crowther, along with team-mates David Bedell-Sivright, and Blair Swannell decided to remain in Australia, to begin a new life, although Crowther later returned to England. All three of these players lost their lives in the First World War.
Career.
Sidney Nelson Crowther practiced as a medical doctor. He received his medical education at the Westminster Hospital, becoming MRCSEng and LRCPLond in 1903. Following his time at Westminster, he took up asylum work at Brookwood Hospital and on completion of the new Surrey asylum at Netherne transferred there as Senior Assistant and later was the Superintendent elect of the Netherne facility. He did not live long enough to become superintendent because, having enlisted as a motor cyclist dispatch rider, he was killed in action during the First World War near Armentieres on 18 October 1914. He had been assigned to the 2nd Signal Troop of the Royal Engineers as a Corporal.
He is commemorated on the Le Touret War Memorial.

Overstrand Hall is a country house in Overstrand, Norfolk, designed by Edwin Lutyens for the 2nd Lord Hillingdon, a partner in Glyn Mills Bank. It was built between 1899 and 1901 and is Grade II listed as of 27 September 1972. Nicholas Pevsner describes it as "one of (Lutyens's) most remarkable buildings, at the time when he had reached maturity but still believed to the full in his own inventiveness." The house is of a complex courtyard plan, with a varied range of materials, "stone with half-timbering, flint with brick and tile", and styles, "Jacobean with classical, vernacular with Italianate." "Burke's and Savills Guide to Country Houses: East Anglia" describes the hall as "an important early work by Lutyens, his first large work outside the Home Counties".
During the First World War, the hall was used as a military hospital and the family sold the house for use as a convalescent home in 1932. Currently (2013), the hall is home to a residential activity centre.

John Balmer

John Raeburn Balmer, OBE, DFC (3 July 1910 – 11 May 1944) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Bendigo, Victoria, he studied law before joining the RAAF as an air cadet in 1932. An instructor at Point Cook from 1935 to 1937, he achieved renown in Air Force circles when he reportedly parachuted from a training aircraft to motivate his pupil to land single-handedly. He also became known to the general public as a cross-country motorist, setting records for trans-Australia and round-Australia trips prior to World War II.
A flight lieutenant when war broke out, Balmer was promoted to squadron leader in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of No. 13 Squadron, which operated Lockheed Hudsons out of Darwin, Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary wing commander in April 1941, and within a year had taken charge of the RAAF's first Bristol Beaufort unit, No. 100 Squadron. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the New Guinea campaign.
Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took command of No. 467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters in the air war over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the following month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No. 467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels.
Early life.
The son of lawyer Sydney Balmer and his wife Catherine ("Kittie"), John Balmer was born in Bendigo, Victoria, on 3 July 1910. He attended Scotch College before studying law at the University of Melbourne. In December 1932, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). Nicknamed "Sam", Balmer undertook flying instruction on the 1933 "B" (reservists) course conducted at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, where his classmates included future group captain John Lerew. Balmer qualified as a pilot and was commissioned in April 1933. His first posting was to No. 1 Squadron, flying Westland Wapitis; he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in November.
Promoted to flight lieutenant, from July 1935 to November 1937 Balmer was assigned to No. 1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, as an instructor. He gained a reputation as a hard taskmaster, and on one occasion—according to RAAF folklore—parachuted from a training aircraft to give his student the proper motivation to make a solo landing, though at least one newspaper at the time reported that he had in fact fallen out. On 15 August 1938, Balmer was forced to crash land an Avro Anson near Whitfield, Victoria, after its wings iced up—one of a series of accidents that befell the type following its introduction to Australian service. By mid-1939 he was instructing on Hawker Demon biplane fighters with No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales.
Parallel to his Air Force career, in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II Balmer gained national attention as a long-distance motorist. Partnered by a fellow officer, he set a cross-country record of 65 hours and 10 minutes travelling from Perth, Western Australia, to Melbourne in December 1936. He and another driver followed this up with a record-breaking round-Australia journey in October–November 1938, completing their run in 23½ days, almost halving the previous best time.
World War II.
South West Pacific.
When Australia declared war in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer was a member of No. 22 Squadron, which conducted coastal surveillance out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, CAC Wirraways. Promoted to squadron leader, he was posted to RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, on 1 June 1940, becoming the inaugural commander of No. 13 Squadron, which had been "cannibalised" from the base's resident unit, No. 12 Squadron. Retaining its Wirraway flight, No. 12 Squadron gave up its two flights of Ansons to the new formation; these were replaced later that month by more capable Lockheed Hudsons. From August 1940 until February 1941, No. 13 Squadron was responsible for patrolling the sea lanes off Australia's north coast. On occasion, Balmer detected Japanese luggers that were illegally fishing in Australian waters and overflew them at such a low altitude that "his Hudson's slipstream rocked the boats violently". He was promoted to temporary wing commander in April. The following month, No. 13 Squadron conducted familiarisation flights over the Dutch East Indies. Balmer handed over command of the unit in August, and transferred to a liaison post at Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin. In January 1942 he briefly took charge of No. 7 Squadron, flying Hudsons on maritime patrol and convoy escort duties from RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria.
In March 1942, Balmer assumed command of the first RAAF unit to operate Australian-built Bristol Beauforts, No. 100 Squadron. It was formed at Richmond using the number of a Royal Air Force squadron that had been decimated in the Malayan campaign. In tribute to its original incarnation, Balmer adopted the RAF unit's crest, which featured a skull-and-crossbones emblem and the motto "Sarang Tebuan Jangan Dijolok" (Malay for "Do not stir up a hornet's nest"). No. 100 Squadron transferred to Mareeba in Far North Queensland on 22 May, after Balmer decided that a proposed base at Cairns was unsuitable owing to periodic flooding. While his crews at Mareeba gained experience on maritime patrols, he travelled to Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 26 May to test the Beaufort in operational conditions; as he came in to land he was fired upon by US anti-aircraft batteries, whose gunners had "never seen a Goddamn aircraft like that before", but escaped damage. Balmer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11 June 1942. On 25 June he took five of No. 100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts that were already stationed there. That night he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the Huon Gulf near Lae. Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs in the face of increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to Milne Bay to again take part in the New Guinea campaign. On 7 September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of P-40 Kittyhawks from Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, Bristol Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron, Hudsons from No. 6 Squadron, and his own No. 100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It was the first time the Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.
Beginning in October, Nos. 6 and 100 Squadrons were given what the official history of the RAAF in World War II called the "huge task" of keeping open the sea lanes between Australia and New Guinea, while disrupting as best they could Japanese lines of communication and supply. The units kept up a punishing schedule of daily long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, "practically without navigation aids, frequently through rain storms and heavy cloud" but, "supported by ground staffs as enduring as themselves, the crews maintained an almost inflexibly high standard and achieved considerable success". On the night of 4/5 October, Balmer took ten of his Beauforts from Milne Bay on a far-ranging assault against Japanese ships in the vicinity of the Shortland Islands, near Bougainville. Two aircraft disappeared along the way in storms and the remainder became separated into two flights that nevertheless managed to rendezvous near the target. Seven of these launched their torpedoes against as many ships and the crews believed that four were accurate, but were unable to confirm any hits because of dwindling visibility. The mission was considered a failure but this was put down to problems with the torpedoes and not the aircrew. Subsequent reports suggested that three ships had in fact been damaged. Balmer came down with malaria in November, and went on three weeks sick leave the following month; he returned to operations on 2 January 1943. In March, during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, No. 100 Squadron launched its last torpedo attack; bad weather prevented all but two aircraft finding their targets, and no hits were registered. Towards the end of the month the unit dropped of bombs on Japanese installations in Salamaua.
Europe.
Balmer relinquished command of No. 100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the South West Pacific to the European theatre that June. His planned secondment to the Royal Air Force was for two years. Partly in an effort to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF group within RAF Bomber Command, in August he was appointed commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron, based at RAF Bottesford, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, and operated Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on Nuremberg the night of 27/28 August, before attacking Hanover in September and October. From its new base at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No. 467 Squadron through the Battle of Berlin that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher. No. 467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle. In the same period it also raided Frankfurt, Leipzig, Stettin, Stuttgart, Essen, and Augsburg. Following the Battle of Berlin, No. 467 Squadron began to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the invasion of the continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No. 5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.
Considered a "dynamic" leader and a "brilliant" pilot, Balmer was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for "great skill and devotion to duty" during "a varied tour of operations"; promulgated in the "London Gazette" on 18 April, the award citation further described him as "a most efficient squadron commander, whose keenness and zeal have set a fine example". He also earned the respect of his crews with displays of empathy such as the occasion one of his young pilots, who had flown on 15 missions, refused to take off on his next sortie. Rather than take disciplinary action, Balmer allowed the man medical leave and sought out respite for him in the country, after which the pilot returned to active duty and completed his tour of operations. From early April, No. 467 Squadron began playing a leading role in a series of attacks against railways, which continued into the following month. Balmer was promoted to temporary group captain on 4 May. On 10/11 May, his Lancasters took part in a raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No. 463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.
Initially posted as missing, Balmer and his crew were later confirmed to have died when their Lancaster crashed near Herenthout in provincial Antwerp, after being attacked by a night fighter. He was buried in Heverlee War Cemetery, outside Brussels. "The Daily Mail" reported that he had accumulated almost 5,000 flying hours, and compared his place in the RAAF to that of Leonard Cheshire's in the RAF. Aged 33, Balmer was unmarried at his death. His DFC was presented to his mother Kittie by the Governor-General of Australia shortly after the end of the war. Balmer's name appears at panel 110 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

William Provost

William Provost (Guilliame Provoost) (fl. 1556–1607) was a Protestant and a merchant who lived in Antwerp, then a city in the Netherlands. William's descendants settled in New Amsterdam (now known as New York (city)) in the early 1600s; he had famous descendants and relatives in North American history; and many North Americans can trace their lineage back to William. William and his family appear to have survived the murderous rampage of the Spanish Fury in 1576. A romanticized version of William's life tells (incorrectly) that he was a Huguenot that fled Paris on the day before the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.
Name variants.
William Provost is his anglicized name and in records, William is variously referred to as Guilliame, Ghiliam, Gulliaem, Giljaem, Gutielmus, or Willem. Provost is also spelt Provoost, Provoest, or the French form of Prévost.
The life of William Provost.
William Provost ""... was a merchant, and resided in the business quarter of He and his wife belonged to the then secret Protestant movement, and it seems that they attended the underground Reformed Church named "De Brabantsche Olijfbergh" [The Brabant's Mount of Olives, but to avoid the Inquisition, they, as was the custom with most Protestants in this region and time period, had their children baptized in the Roman Catholic Church of St Walburgis in their neighbourhood."" (Confirmation, with minor additions and corrections, is presented in.)
The St Walburgis' Catholic Church (known as Sint Walburgis Kerk in Antwerp) no longer exists.
William Provost and his second wife, Maeijken Stevens, may have fled Antwerp in 1576 at the time of the Spanish Fury. However, this has not been confirmed. Indeed there are records for William Provost’s family in Antwerp up to 1584 (although no supporting evidence is given in that reference). Perhaps they fled and then returned. At some time William Provost and his family seem to have moved to nearby Middelburg in the Province of Zeeland. Unfortunately Middelburg's archives were destroyed during World War II.
William Provost moved to Amsterdam around 1605 and he was still alive in 1607 when his daughter Katherina married. William's will, written in 1606, lists three of his children: Elijsabeth (deceased but whose child was alive), Katherina, and Wilhelmus.
The romanticized version of William Provost's life.
There is a romanticized version of historical events that have been attributed to William. Although some aspects of this version are incorrect it is important to document this version as these events have been oft quoted by his descendants.
There are two major historical references that document the romanticized version of William's life:
These references tell the story that William lived in Paris and was warned by a Colonel in the King's army about the impending St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. It is then reported that William fled to Holland with his fiancee, escaping the massacre. William was also described as ""... a person of distinction and eminence ..."" and ""noble blood"".
This version of William's life lists his children as Johannes, David, Wilhelmes, Elias, and Benjamin. Johannes was actually Wilhelmus, the father of David who emigrated to New Amsterdam (now known as New York (city)) in 1624 (see below).
There seems to have been some confusion regarding William Provost's story that was handed down to the following generations. Perhaps the story that William Provost was warned by a Colonel in the army and fled is correct ... only that it occurred in Antwerp prior to the Spanish Fury. Some of the descendants of William Provost may have incorrectly linked this event with the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in Paris.
The accurate version of William's life was determined by genealogist Hendrik O Slok, as he felt that the early history of William Provost ""... has remained shrouded and vague ..."".
The immediate family of William Provost.
The family of William Provost Provoost:
William married Maria Karreman in 1556, William and Maria had:
William married Maeijken Stevens in 1564, William and Maeijken had (all baptised at St Walburgis' Catholic Church, Antwerp):
The genealogy of some of William's descendants, that lived mainly in the New York area, is documented to at least 1895.
Famous relatives of William Provost.
It has been suggested that two of William's brother fled to Switzerland. However, that William was a brother of the two has not been confirmed. Descendants of this side of the family are:

Michael Palmer (musician)

Michael Palmer (born 1960), also known as Palma Dog, is a Jamaican reggae musician who released several albums in the 1980s.
Biography.
Born in the Maxfield Park area of Kingston in 1960, Palmer began his career performing with sound systems such as Stereophonic Sound with General Echo in the late 1970s, taking inspiration from the success of his neighbour Leroy Smart. The shooting death of Echo and Stereophonic's owner Big John in 1980 was a blow to Palmer's career. His debut single, "Mr Landlord", recorded for producer Oswald Thomas was not successful, and it was not until a couple of years later when he found success with "Smoke the Weed", recorded at Channel One, and with producer Jah Thomas on tracks such as "Ghetto Dance" and "Different Love". He went on to work with a variety of producers including George Phang, Sugar Minott, Prince Jammy, and Joseph Hoo Kim, and enjoyed a number one single in Jamaica in 1984 with "Lick Shot". He also performed at the Reggae Sunsplash festival that year. His recordings led to a series of mid-1980s albums, including split albums with Frankie Jones, Frankie Paul, Johnny Osbourne, and Kelly Ranks. 
Palmer moved into production, achieving success with Neville Brown's "Haul and Pull Up", and returned to recording himself in the early 1990s, with singles such as "Juggling" and "Everyone Makes Love".

Robert Goldwyn

Robert Malcolm Goldwyn (Worcester, Massachusetts, 1930–2010) was an American surgeon; an author, activist, Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, and Chief of Plastic Surgery at the Beth Israel Hospital from 1972 to 1996. He was the editor-in-chief of "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery" for 25 years.
Medical education.
Goldwyn graduated with a M.D. from Harvard Medical School. During his internship and residency (1956–1961) at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts he was also the Harvey Cushing Fellow in Surgery. His training in plastic surgery was at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 1961 to 1963.
Activism and Preservation.
In 1960, he worked with Dr. Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, Gabon for two months. In 1972, he established The National Archives of Plastic Surgery in the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.
He was a founding member of Physicians for Social Responsibility and wrote articles on world peace, opposition to chemical and biological warfare, and medical ethics.
Awards and Honors.
When the New England Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons established the Robert M. Goldwyn Lifetime Achievement Award and made Goldwyn its first recipient, he stated, "I do not really deserve this. But as Jack Benny said, ‘I have arthritis and I don't deserve that either.’
Goldwyn was a Visiting Professor to more than 70 institutions, universities, and hospitals in the United States and abroad and was an honorary member of more than a dozen national and international societies of plastic surgery. He was President of the 1994 Meeting of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons in St. Louis, Missouri. He was honored by France, Germany, and Italy with their highest medals for his work in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In Berlin, at the 2007 International Confederation for Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, he presented the inaugural "Ulrich Hinderer Memorial Lecture". His other awards include the 2005 Honorary Kazanjian Lectureship, 1991 Clinician of the Year of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons, the 2004 American Association of Plastic Surgeons Honorary Award, and the Presidential Citation of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
Authorship.
As a writer, he authored or co-authored more than 350 articles, more than 50 chapters, and edited books including "The Unfavorable Result in Plastic Surgery: Avoidance and Treatment", "Reconstructive Surgery of the Breast", "Long-Term Results in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery", "Reduction Mammaplasty", "The Patient and the Plastic Surgeon", "The Operative Note", "The Physician Traveler" (18 volumes), and an autobiography, "Beyond Appearance: Reflections of a Plastic Surgeon".
Retirement.
Marking his retirement in 2004 as editor-in-chief of "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery", Goldwyn was presented the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Special Recognition Award during the Plastic Surgery 2004 opening ceremonies in Philadelphia. The Journal's circulation, which was 5,100 when Goldwyn took over in 1980, by 2004 had achieved the number one peer-reviewed impact factor among all plastic surgery journals worldwide.
His final book, "Retired not dead: thoughts plastic surgical and otherwise," was published in 2008.
Death.
At the age of 79, he died in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts on March 23, 2010 after a 16-year battle with prostate cancer.

Royal Oman Police

The Royal Oman Police (ROP), also known as Oman Police (), is the main law and order agency for the Sultanate of Oman. It maintains a helicopter fleet and also carries on the duties of safeguarding the long Omani coastline.
Background.
The concept of a modern police force was relatively new to Oman when Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said rose to power after overthrowing his father in a palace coup on July 23, 1970. However, history shows that the first police in Oman was first institutionalized in the 1700s in Sohar. Hardly 30 years, ago, no internal security force existed in Oman. Security was the responsibility of the local walis or governors who carried it out with the help of local "Askars". The police presence was limited to the township of Muscat and Mutrah, where most of the souqs were present and most of the trade took place.
Once in power, Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, in addition to his other reform campaigns, went about building an efficient and modern police force in Oman. In 1974, Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said conferred the title Royal Oman Police (ROP) on the newly formed force. In November that year, ROP received its colours from the Sultan. The next year, the ROP headquarters was inaugurated in Qurum.
The Royal Oman Police joined the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) in 1972, and the Arab Organization for Social Defense Against Crime in the same year.
Organisation.
The Royal Oman Police is a well organised police force. Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said is the supreme commander of the ROP. Under him comes the "Inspector General of Police and Customs". The title of "the Commissioner for police" which was used to be the title of the president of the force under the old Police Law No. 5/1973, a Royal Decree was issued on 26 November 1974 changing the title to "the Inspector General of Police and Customs". The post is currently held by Lt Gen Hassan bin Mohsin Al Shraiqi who replaced Lt Gen Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari as per royal decrees by the Sultan amidst the 2011 Oman protests.
ROP carries out the tasks of a coast guard as well and is empowered to carry out all custom related tasks. ROP also maintains a well trained dog section (created on 24 September 1976).
ROP maintains a fleet of support helicopters which perform a host of functions from fire-fighting to ambulance services to thermal imagery in anti-smuggling operations.
ROP also maintains horse and camel mounted troopers, who patrol terrains inaccessible to motor vehicles. The camel mounted officers are easy to be spotted on patrol near the Omani border, whereas horse-mounted officers are a common sight on Muscat's beaches.
Academy and Training.
Initially, Police training School at Qurum trained police cadres. On 9 November 1976, the first passing out ceremony of the School of Oman's first batch of Cader Officers was conducted here under the patrongae of the Sultan.
In 1980 Sultan opened the Police Academy near Nizwa, recently renamed as the Sultan Qaboos Academy for Police Sciences. It provides basic training for police personnel, as well as diploma courses in police sciences for university graduates or those with equivalent qualifications. It also trains candidates for senior positions in the ROP.
The Police College, which is within the SQAPS complex, was established in 2000 and trains ROP officers and awards diplomas and degrees in law and police sciences.
The Traffic Safety Institute was set up to train both traffic police personnel and road users.
Specialized Forces.
A new command headquarters called "The Oil and Gas Installations Command" has been set up under the ROP to protect the Oman's valuable oil and gas installations. 
The "Police Coastguard Command" has been equipped with new fast patrol boats, while the older boats currently in use have been modernized and fitted with new engines. An engineering and maintenance workshop makes sure the patrol crafts are always serviceable.
A "Sea Rescue Group" has been established to help prevent drowning accidents, respond to SOS calls, improve the monitoring of Oman's coastline and prevent illegal immigration and smuggling.
The Police Aviation Directorate comprises AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters (currently 4 in service and more are being procured). It comprises a helicopter fire-fighting service for use in areas that are relatively inaccessible to ordinary fire engines as Oman has a vastly mountainous terrain. The Sultanate is one of the first countries in the region to set up this service and several pilots have now been trained to man it. The Police Aviation Directorate is to use its helicopter fleets for use in the Flying Ambulance service, for fire-fighting and rescue missions, or with to provide monitoring and support services for the ROP's other departments using thermal imaging systems.
Women in the ROP.
Oman has always thrived for providing equal status to its women population unlike its neighboring countries. The ROP has been no different. ROP has significant number of women cadres who serve in logistical, support wings as well as in the Traffic police. The ROP also has an all women music band. Women cadres undergo as strict a training as their male counterparts go and yet Omani women have come out in numbers to join the police force.
Additional Functions.
The ROP provides a range of services.
Civil affairs.
The Directorate-General of Civil Status registers the births, marriages, divorces and deaths of Omani nationals, as well as the births and deaths of expatriate residents in the Sultanate, in addition to their marriages and divorces if one of the parties to the marriage or divorce is an Omani. 
Omani nationals are also issued with "smart" multipurpose ID cards, which are both flexible and secure and – among other things – show the holder's driving licence details. Such smart cards have become a norm in almost all Arab nations.
Residence cards are also issued to resident expatriates working in the Sultanate, and their dependants. The labour card and the residence card have now been combined into one card.
Customs.
Port Sultan Qaboos, Muscat International Airport and all overland crossing points now use an improved Customs computer system. This has been put in place to improve customs clearance procedures and customs clearance offices. These moves are designed to support the national economy and come in response to the Gulf Co-operation Council Customs Union and the Greater Arab Free Trade Zone.
Using its new container and motor vehicle inspection equipment, the Directorate General of Customs is now better equipped to detect and identify prohibited substances and smuggled goods. A declaration on a container security and goods inspection initiative has also been signed between the Directorate-General of Customs and its American counterpart, allowing for the inspection of goods transported by sea between Omani and American ports. This shall prove to be of significant help especially now that Oman and USA have a free trade agreement in place.
Road Safety and Traffic Police.
On 4 September 1970, the police department took over the responsibility of motor vehicles licensing which used to be under the Muscat and Muttrah Municipality initially. Ever since the ROP has worked to put in place an efficient traffic policing system.
Oman has continuously recorded a huge leap in road accidents and accident related deaths. Oman’s road traffic death rate is 28 per 100,000 population which is far higher than the global average of 19 killed per 100,000. Due to this the ROP has taken a tough stance agsint negligient drivers. Vehicles are regularly inspected, training standards for drivers have been raised and traffic rules are rigorously enforced, particularly with regard to speed limits. Intensive awareness campaigns are regularly held for drivers and other sections of society, including school students. To this end, the police work closely with other departments and organisations, particularly the Ministry of Education and the media. By the end of 2005, fixed and mobile radar speed detectors had been installed in all the governorates and regions in a further attempt to help reduce traffic accidents.
The Omani government and the ROP have continuously made road safety their top priority. They have also worked effectively to promote road safety internationally. Oman submitted a draft resolution to the UN General Assembly entitled "Road safety must not be left to chance", to help promote international co-operation on the prevention of traffic accidents, which was adopted by the UN in 2004 (Titled – A/58/289). 
In March 2006, the ROP won first prize in an international contest, in which 36 countries participated and organised. The competition was organized by the United Nations, at the 1st Global Road Safety Film Festival in Geneva, for a film entitled "Pain and Hope", a documentary highlighting the suffering of families who lose relatives in road accidents. The film is currently stored in the UN library.
Ambulance Services.
The ROP provides a Highway Emergency Ambulance Service for victims of road and other accidents. The Ambulance Unit, which has a fleet of modern ambulances with modern high – tech medical equipment, covers the Governorate of Muscat up to Batinah Region, as well as the main road from the wilayat of Barka to Khatmat Malahah on the UAE border. The service is proposed to be expanded to cover the entire country.
The Ambulance Service uses an advanced telecommunications system directed through the ROP's telecommunications centre. The system co-ordinates the movement of ambulances to ensure that they reach the scene of an accident in the shortest possible time.
Civil Defense services.
With regard to the protection of buildings, installations and property, the Directorate-General of Civil Defence has been supplied with civil defence and fire-fighting equipment.
2011 Oman protests.
The ROP played a highly criticised role in the 2011 Omani protests. On 28 February 2011, in Sohar, 250 kilometres north of Oman's capital Muscat, the ROP was reported to have opened fire using live bullets on protesters. The ROP had been using tear gas to quell protesters since the morning. However, the protesters became violent and started torching government buildings, including the Wali's office and the nearby police station. The police in its defense has stated that it had only used rubber bullets to throw back the protesters who were going to burn the police station while members of the ROP were still trapped inside. Two protesters were reported dead and it was believed that various police officers were injured too.

Ragnar Stoud Platou

Ragnar Stoud Platou (8 April 1897 – 1 April 1979) was a Norwegian ship broker.
Personal life.
Platou was born to the banker Gabriel Andreas Stoud Platou (1858–1911) and his wife Ingeborg Sophie Falck (1864–1958). His younger brother was the architect Frithjof Stoud Platou. He was also nephew of Christian Emil Stoud Platou and Waldemar Stoud Platou, and cousin of Karen Platou.
He married Anna Margareta von Friesen Parelius (1892–1970) on 11 October 1919, but divorced with her in 1939. On 5 April the same year, Platou married Anette Beate Wackenitz Horn (1908–94).

SparkChess

SparkChess is a commercial chess program designed by Armand Niculescu for Media Division srl. It is written entirely in ActionScript. Originally intended to be played online, it was ported on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux as well as on tablets and phones running iOS (iPad), Android (Samsung Galaxy Tab, Motorola Xoom) and Tablet OS (BlackBerry Playbook).
History.
The first version of the program was called flashCHESS, written in ActionScript 1. It was released in 2002, intended as a technology demo for Macromedia. A slightly improved version was released in the next year, with a 3D isometric view. Because of the limitations of the programming language, the game was very slow and did not implement all the chess rules.
Development was resumed in 2007 and the game was rewritten from scratch. The new version, entitled flashCHESS 3, was released in 2008. The new engine was much faster and implemented all chess rules correctly.
Citing complaints from Adobe Systems, owner of the "Flash" software brand, the game was later rebranded as SparkChess.
In 2009, SparkChess was featured in a technology demo by Google for Chrome OS.
In 2010, SparkChess was ported to iPad and Android tablets.
In 2011, version 5 added online multiplayer support and HD graphics.
In 2012, version 6 added multithreading on the desktop version, vastly improved speed, some multiplayer enhancements and Facebook integration.
In 2014, version 7 revamped the interface and - based on user feedback - introduced a new intermediary difficulty level, some chess lessons and multiplayer enhancements, among other platform-dependent features.
Features.
SparkChess is a single-player and multiplayer chess program. It includes the chess engine and the graphical interface. The board can be represented in 3D with perspective (although it can't be rotated arbitrary) and in 2D (diagram mode). The game progress is saved automatically after each move and additionally it offers a limited number of "save slots". Games can also be imported and exported as PGN.
The game also has a PGN player that shows comments, annotations and Recursive Annotated Variations. The game can import an entire PGN database at once. There is also a board editor with the ability to import and export board configurations in FEN format.
SparkChess has some tutoring facilities, including a "Help me move" option that suggests the best move the player can do and visual hints, an option that highlights player's pieces under attack, squares controlled by the opponent and other hints aimed at beginners. The board analysis explains the current board in plain English based on criteria such as material, positioning, mobility, pawn structure and king safety. There are also some chess lessons explaining the basic rules.
The online multiplayer mode is built upon Union Platform, a multiplayer server written in Java.
In a December 2011 interview the author states 420,000 weekly users for SparkChess.
Platforms.
SparkChess runs in any browser that has the Adobe Flash Player plugin. 
It also runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux.
More recently it has been ported on mobile devices, including iPhone iPad.
Engine characteristics.
SparkChess uses alpha-beta pruning with principal variation, iterative deepening and aspiration window. It also uses quiescence search, history heuristics and transposition tables. It has an opening database with about 7000 moves. Because of programming environment limitations, it does not use bitboard tables or end-game tables.

Skip graph

Skip graphs are a kind of distributed data structure based on skip lists. They have the full functionality of a balanced tree in a distributed system. Skip graphs are mostly used in searching peer-to-peer networks. As they provide the ability to query by key ordering, they improve other search tools based on the hash table functionality only. In contrast to skip lists and other tree data structures, they are very resilient and can tolerate a large fraction of node fails. Also, constructing, inserting, searching and repairing a skip graph that was disturbed by failing nodes can be done by simple and straightforward algorithms.

Davor Slamnig

Davor Slamnig (born 13 March 1956 in Zagreb) is a Croatian writer and musician.
Biography.
Slamnig was born on 13 March 1956 in Zagreb, where he finished his primary education as well as graduated from grammar school. He allegedly never finished his musical education as well as his studies at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb. He attended further education in the US, in Bloomington, Indiana and in Chicago.
Writing career.
Slamnig's writing attempts became more serious in 1977, when he started publishing his short stories in youth periodicals, mainly in "Polet". Those stories were re-published in the collection "Čudovište" ("Monster") in 1980.
The next three years he continued publishing short stories, gathered into a second collection, "Qwertzu i Opš" in 1983. After that book came out, a long period of literary silence ensued.
Slamnig resuscitated as an author in 2002, when he published the novel "Topli zrak" ("Hot Air"). That was the first printed "long-playing" effort by the Zagreb author that sparked a great interest among the public, and which was awarded "Jutarnji list"'s First Prize. The novel entered the finals of the Bosnian prize Meša Selimović.
Slamnig returned to the short story format (or, at least, to collecting them into a book) in 2005 with the title "Krumpirova rodbina" ("Potato's Kin"). The collection contained works published from 1986 until 2005. He was presented with awards for two of the short stories from that book, "Teletabisi" ("Teletubbies") and "Kak smo postali Dalmatinci" ("How We All Became Dalmatians"), with the Second Prize of "Večernji list" in 2004, and with the Prize Ranko Marinković and the Prize of "Večernji list" in 2006 respectively.
In 2011 Slamnig published a short story "Meaning" ("Smisao") in the May/June 2010 International Science Fiction issue of the World Literature Today (WLT) magazine.
Musical career.
At the same time Slamnig pursued a musical career as well.
His first published song was "Debil Blues", written together with Goran "Pipo" Pavelić, the first playable and singable comic, drawn by the then informal leader of the Zagreb comic group Novi Kvadrat, Mirko Ilić.
In 1979 Slamnig joined the Slovenian cult band Buldožer as a guitarist. As member of the band he played and sang on their 1980 album "Izlog jeftinih slatkiša". It was an important album for the group, that was left without one of the key members and authors, Marko Brecelj who left not long ago. Apart from playing the guitar, Slamnig co-authored the songs "Karlo", "Slovinjak punk" and "Žene i muškarci", the latter being called a hit single by band-members: Slamnig also delivered Brecelj’s poem "Okrutni bogovi istoka". Slamnig did not remain a member of Buldožer for a long time, which comes not as a surprise regarding the fact that he lived in Zagreb, and the rest of the band in Slovenia.
Slamnig gathered his own band with Žarko Mandić on bass and Radovan Lučić on drums, while the vocal duties were delegated to the then leading Zagreb actress Mira Furlan. The album "Mira Furlan i Orkestar Davora Slamniga" was recorded in Ljubljana at the end of 1982, and it was published by in Maribor by Helidon, where Boris Bele, the leader of Buldožer acted as Editor in Chief. The then unknown Srđan Dedić playing the piano and synthesizer as guest musician. Almost all the lyrics and music were written by Slamnig. Only the lyrics for "Dječačići" were coauthored by Furlan, and the music for "Samo da te malo" by Mandić. The album became one of the lost masterpieces of Zagreb music from the so-called New Wave era.
Slamnig played in the band Dee Dee Mellow for a while, while the group was dissolving slowly after publishing a single audio-cassette.
Slamnig wrote the score for the popular TV-show "Blentoni", and his song "Frida" was recorded by Psihomodo Pop.
Today Slamnig is a member of the band Psi od Slame (Straw Dogs) with another veteran "gray eminence" of the New Wave era, the musician and theatre-person Pjer Žardin. Up to this day the band has released no official recordings apart from those available at their Internet site.
Other activities.
Slamnig created and recorded some jingles for the Zagreb Radio 101 as well as answering machine messages. He also did some programming. His Another MasterMind for Windows is one of the more witted version of the game adapted for computers.

Everyone (Skins series 5)

Everyone is the finale of series 5 of the British teen drama "Skins". It aired on E4 on 17 March 2011.
Synopsis.
Grace, lying to her father that she is saying goodbye to the gang, sets off to Liv's place to prepare for her wedding. Blood gives her a brooch, without telling her it has a tracking device in it. Meanwhile Rich is given a haircut - and most of his hair is cut off in the process, leading to mocking comments from Nick and Alo that he looks like Justin Bieber. Mini goes to the Levan house and coldly orders Matty to stay away from Franky, whom she has been protecting because Matty has "made her ill." After making final preparations, the gang set off for the church in a neighbouring town, and Blood fails to notice Grace's tracker moving away from Bristol at high speed because he is busy exercising.
Unfortunately, Alo, Rich's best man, has not brought a proper map with him, and drives them into the middle of nowhere. To make matters worse, the van breaks down. Angry with him, Rich and Grace manage to hitch a ride to the church with a couple going the same way. They give the gang directions, and they set off on foot. Liv and Matty, however, lose confidence in Alo's navigation skills and decide to set off on their own. They invite Franky to go along with them, and despite Mini's pleas, Franky agrees. Rich and Grace finally make it to the church, but discover they have missed their slot. Fortunately, the priest is able to offer them a slot in an hour, giving the gang that amount of time to get there. For fear that they won't show up, Grace recruits an elderly couple. Liv, Matty and Franky, meanwhile, take some cocaine and reach a nearby village. They break into the village church (not the one they are meant to go to) and Matty begins to play the piano. Liv, remembering his reaction at seeing her kiss Franky in Twelfth Night, starts to seduce Franky in front of him. He shakes his head at her, and they are chased off by the gun-wielding church owner. After reaching safety, Matty and Liv have an argument about Liv's actions in the church, and she admits that she is afraid of losing him. Franky keeps going, and Liv desperately begs Matty to stay with her, but he chooses to go after Franky instead. Mini, meanwhile, gets fed up with Alo and Nick's seemingly uncaring behaviour, because she is worried that something will happen to her friend. She splits off from the two and goes to find Liv, Matty and Franky herself. This leaves Alo and Nick to take their own route. On the way, Nick gets snared in a rabbit trap. Alo manages to free his leg and helps him limp on, until they reach a road. Mini manages to meet up with Liv, and, after discovering that Franky is missing, admits that she is frightened for Franky’s safety, which prompts Liv to question whether Mini has a crush on Franky; she and Liv reconcile and set off to find Franky and Matty. Problems get worse when Professor Blood, while having lunch, sees Grace's location on his GPS and immediately goes after her.
Matty eventually catches up with Franky, and they stand in the middle of the forest. They have a heated argument, and she tearfully recounts having said that 9/11 was “the most beautiful thing” she could think of as a 6-year old child, which had made her schoolmates and teachers believe she was mentally disturbed, and believes that her parents knew she was 'wrong', which is why she was put up for adoption. The two then start to kiss on the forest floor. Then, very suddenly, Franky has a panic attack and throws Matty off before running off through the woods in a blind rage, with a shocked Matty in hot pursuit. She runs past Liv and Mini, who stop Matty and demand an explanation. Seeing him hastily button up his trousers, they realise what has happened and, frightened that Franky might hurt herself in her current state of mind, join in the chase. As they catch up with Franky and call to her, she is distracted – and immediately trips over a branch, and falls over the side of a cliff. Despite some resistance from Franky, Liv manages to pull her back up, and they gather around to comfort her. Meanwhile, Alo and Nick see David Blood drive past on his way to the church, and desperately flag down a ride. They manage to get there ahead of him, and warn Grace and Rich, who proceed with the service. Before it can continue, David and Sonia enter the Church, to discover what is happening. They have a confrontation with Grace, as Mini, Franky, Liv and Matty arrive. Blood angrily informs everyone that they are expelled, but Nick angrily accuses him of flaunting his powers, before making an impassioned speech. Blood sullenly agrees to let them continue, and leaves the church. 
But Grace and Rich decide that they don’t need to get married after all, and proceed to a nearby marquee, to celebrate the wedding. There, Liv and Matty reconcile but break up and are left on somewhat good terms, and Franky calms down. As she enters the marquee, she and Matty text each other from across the tent and eventually make peace. The episode ends as the two embrace.

Dhammalok Mahasthavir

Dhammalok Mahasthavir (Devanagari: धम्मालोक महास्थविर) (born Das Ratna Tuladhar) (16 January 1890 – 17 October 1966) was a Nepalese Buddhist monk who worked to revive Theravada Buddhism in Nepal in the 1930s and 1940s. For this act, he was expelled from the country by the tyrannical Rana regime.
Dhammalok was also a writer who contributed to the Nepal Bhasa renaissance. He worked to promote Theravada Buddhism and Nepal Bhasa braving government persecution.
Early life.
Dhammalok (alternative names: Bhikkhu Dhammalok Mahathero, Dharmaloka) was born Das Ratna Tuladhar at Asan Dhalasikwa, Kathmandu to a trading family. His father was Kesh Sundar and his mother Bekha Laxmi Tuladhar. Das Ratna engaged in business in Tibet during his early years and was known by the nickname Baran Sahu (बारां साहु).
He was married to Dibya Laxmi with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Grief at the death of his wife and his association with Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan of India drew him towards religion. His elder son Gaja Ratna too became a Buddhist monk, taking up the name Aniruddha Mahathera.
Imprisonment and ordination.
In 1929, Das Ratna went to Sri Lanka for religious study. Returning to Nepal, he lived at the monastery of Kindo Baha near Swayambhu where he conducted regular prayer meetings and distributed pamphlets written in Nepal Bhasa appealing for donations. On 6 November 1931, he was arrested and imprisoned for seven days as it was illegal to write in Nepal Bhasa or propagate Buddhism. Subsequently, Das Ratna went to Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar) where he lived a year. Returning from Burma, he went to Kusinagar where he became a novice monk and took the name Dhammalok in 1933.
Dhammalok returned to Kindo Baha where he began writing a series of books in Nepal Bhasa that challenged traditional thinking. "Lokay Kuchal Kubyabahar Sudhar" ("Reforming Ill Practices and Customs in Society") and "Dharmaya Namay Pap" ("Sinning in the Name of Religion") published from Varanasi, India are some of his well known works. Dhammalok has also translated "Buddha Charita", a biography of the Buddha by Asva Ghosh, into Nepal Bhasa from the Sanskrit. Among his notable books, the travelogue "Mahachin Yatra" ("A Journey to Great China") was published from Kalimpong in 1950. Dhammalok received higher ordination in Sarnath in 1935.
Into exile.
In 1943, Dhammalok established Ananda Kuti Vihar, the first Theravada monastery in modern Nepal, at Swayambhu. It became the center for the Theravada community.
The government declared that the activities of the Theravada monks of spreading Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa were illegal, and on 30 July 1944, eight monks including Dhammalok, Pragyananda Mahasthavir and Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir were expelled from Nepal for refusing to sign a pledge to stop doing so. The exiled monks first went to Kushinagar, India and then to Sarnath. On the full moon day of 31 November 1944 in Sarnath, they founded Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching) which published books and a magazine on Buddhism titled "Dharmodaya".
Dhammalok spent his exile in India, Tibet and Bhutan, and returned to Kathmandu on 5 June 1946 after the ban was lifted. From 1946, following pressure from Indian Buddhist societies, the government also allowed publication of literature in Nepal Bhasa after being censored. Dhammalok devoted his later years to writing. He also worked to develop Lumbini and Kapilavastu, the Buddha's birthplace and family home in southern Nepal. Dhammalok died at Ananda Kuti Vihar.

Mabo Day

Mabo Day occurs annually on 3 June. It commemorates Eddie Koiki Mabo ("c". 29 June 1936–21 January 1992) a Torres Strait Islander whose campaign for Indigenous land rights led to a landmark decision of the High Court of Australia that, on 3 June 1992, overturned the legal fiction of "terra nullius" which had characterised Australian law with regards to land and title since the voyage of James Cook in 1770.
In 2010 a campaign was launched to make it a national holiday in Australia It has been suggested that Mabo Day is more significant to Australians than the Queen's Birthday (a national holiday in Australia), since it 'marks the day that non-indigenous Australians were given the opportunity to reverse the damage caused by the colonisation process'. In 2002, on the tenth anniversary of the High Court decision, Mabo's widow, Bonita Mabo, called for a national public holiday on 3 June. On the eleventh anniversary, in 2003, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) launched a petition to make 3 June an Australian Public Holiday. Eddie Mabo Jnr, for the Mabo family, said:
We believe that a public holiday would be fitting to honour and recognise the contribution to the High Court decision of not only my father and his co-plaintiffs, James Rice, Father Dave Passi, Sam Passi and Celuia Salee, but also to acknowledge all Indigenous Australians who have empowered and inspired each other.
To date we have not had a public holiday that acknowledges Indigenous people and which recognises our contribution, achievements and survival in Australia.
A public holiday would be a celebration all Australians can share in with pride – a celebration of truth that unites Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and a celebration of justice that overturned the legal myth of terra nullius - Mabo symbolises truth and justice and is a cornerstone of Reconciliation.

Neckar-Alb Railway

The Neckar-Alb Railway (, KBS 760) is a main line from Stuttgart via Reutlingen to Tübingen. It largely follows the meandering course of the Neckar river, but, between Nürtingen and Tübingen the line runs through the Swabian Alps. Between Stuttgart and Plochingen the line runs parallel to the Fils Valley Railway, trains on this section also sometimes use the Fils Valley line tracks. The line is fully electrified and double track throughout. Interchange is possible between Plochingen and Tübingen in Wendlingen am Neckar, Nürtingen, Metzingen and Reutlingen. There are level crossings in Wendlingen, Oberboihingen and Wannweil. There are three crossings in Oberboihingen, including two which can be manually operated by a gatekeeper, the only ones in Germany.
History.
The modern Neckar-Alb Railway consists of two historically independent routes: the suburban line called the Stuttgart–Plochingen line (VzG line number 4701) and the Plochingen–Tübingen line, which was historically a section of the Upper Neckar Railway ("Oberen Neckarbahn", VzG line number 4600). Both lines are now owned by DB Netze.
Stuttgart–Plochingen section.
The Stuttgart–Plochingen section was built in 1846 as part of the Fils Valley Railway ("Filstalbahn"). Two additional parallel tracks were built in 1914. The new tracks are now used by all trains operating on the Neckar-Alb Railway, except for Interregio-Express services, which instead operate on the tracks of the Fils Valley Railway. In addition trains operating as line S1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn run on these tracks.
Plochingen–Tübingen section.
The first section of today's line opened in 1859 between Plochingen (which had been connected to Stuttgart by the Württemberg Central Railway, now the Fils Valley Railway, since 1846) and Reutlingen by the Royal Württemberg State Railways. In 1861 the Upper Neckar line was extended via Tübingen to Rottenburg. The line was extended to Eyach (1864) and Horb am Neckar (1866) and eventually reached Immendingen in 1870. The line towards Horb from Tübingen is still known as the Upper Neckar Railway, but there are only a few through trains running on both sections of the line.
As early as 1888 the line was duplicated to Tübingen and the line was electrified by 1 October 1934. Neither upgrade have yet been carried out on the line towards Horb.
The former stations of Bempflingen, Betzingen and Kirchentellinsfurt have been reduced in status to halts ("Haltepunkten", that is they do not have sets of points) in the second half of the 20th century. In addition, between Plochingen and Tübingen many sidings and freight yards have been abandoned.
Current operations.
A dense network of regional trains, including Interregio-Express services, connect the Neckar-Alb region with the transportat hub of Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof. The line is operated by "DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee" (RAB), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn.
Signalling on the Plochingen-Wendlingen section is control by an electronic interlocking in Plochingen, itself controlled from the operations centre in Karlsruhe. There is also an electronic signal box in Reutlingen in operation. Otherwise, signalling in controlled by relay interlockings.
S-Bahn.
Between Stuttgart and Kirchheim unter Teck S-Bahn services on line S1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn run on the tracks of the Neckar-Alb Railway. This line passes through Plochingen, Wernau, Wendlingen am Neckar, Kirchheim (Teck)-Ötlingen to Kirchheim unter Teck.
Regionalbahn.
Regionalbahn (RB) services run from Monday to Friday between Plochingen and Tübingen every hour, from Metzingen to Reutlingen every half hour and every half hour to Tübingen in the peak hour. On weekends, RB services run every two hours; on Saturday mornings there are additional services between and Metzingen and Tübingen. Nearly all regional services continue from Tübingen on the Ammer Valley Railway to Herrenberg. Almost all RB services are formed of class 650 diesel multiple units.
Regional Express.
Regional-Express (RE) services run on the line every hour and every half hour in peak hours. Almost all RE are services are hauled by class 143 locomotives. There are two services each way with old double-deck carriages (with green seats and no air conditioning), three services, each with five double-deck carriages (with air conditioning and LED lighting) delivered in 2008 and one service with five refurbished Silberling carriages plus a control car in both the morning and afternoon rush hour.
The last pair of trains to and from Tübingen is usually operated with class 611 diesel multiple units. The RE trains between Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and Tübingen Hauptbahnhof stop in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Esslingen, Plochingen, Wendlingen, Nürtingen, Metzingen and Reutlingen Hauptbahnhof. The extra peak services also stop in Wernau.
Interregio-Express.
Between Tübingen and Stuttgart an Interregio-Express (IRE) service operated every two hours with only one stop in Reutlingen. Almost all of the IRE services are operated with class 611 diesel multiple units. In peak hours there are additional IRE services operated with locomotive-hauled trains. These use a class 110 electric locomotive hauling three Silberling carriages and a driving trailer.
Long distance.
Since the timetable change in December 2009, the Neckar-Alb Railway is also served by long distance services. From Mondays to Fridays an InterCity service runs at 06:11 from Tübingen with stops in Reutlingen, Metzingen and Nürtingen and Plochingen via Stuttgart to Düsseldorf and Berlin. Services to Düsseldorf (IC 2010) and Berlin (IC 2011) reach their destinations in the evening and IC 1915 reaches Tübingen, from Mondays to Thursdays, at 19:50, and, on Sundays, at 21:50. This link is a trial limited to two years.
Freight.
During Deutsche Bahn’s “market-oriented freight supply” reform program (MORA C), Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL) took over all freight transport between Tübingen and Plochingen, previously operated by Railion, in 2002. Despite considerable demand, HzL retired from this business after several years of disagreement over the access charges incurred for its services. Since then, the Tübingen freight yard is only regularly served towards the west, with a few exceptions, such as for the storage of track maintenance trains.
The only regular freight runs between Plochingen and Wendlingen am Neckar (and from there via the Teck Railway to Oberlenningen) and between Plochingen and Nürtingen (and from there via the Täles Railway to Neuffen). Freight also runs from Plochingen to Metzingen (from there on the Erms Valley Railway via Dettingen an der Erms to Bad Urach). Plans to transport waste from the districts of Tübingen and Reutlingen to the Stuttgart-Münster Incinerator by rail have been abandoned.
The city of Reutlingen has secured the site of the former freight depot so that a container terminal can be built there.
Planning.
For several years discussion have been under way on plans to integrate the Plochingen–Wendlingen–Nürtingen–Reutlingen–Tübingen line together with other regional lines (Ammer Valley Railway, Erms Valley Railway, Swabian Alb Railway, Zollernalb Railway and the Upper Neckar Railway) into the Neckar-Alb Regional Stadtbahn on the Karlsruhe model.
As part of Stuttgart 21, it is planned to connect the Neckar-Alb Railway via the Little Wendlingen Curve ("Kleine Wendlinger Kurve") to the Wendlingen–Ulm high-speed railway. This will cut travel times from Tübingen to Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station at Stuttgart Airport in half and reduce travel time to the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof by 4 minutes.
Fare zones.
Between Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and Bempflingen, fares on the line runs are coordinated by the Transport and Tariff Association of Stuttgart ("Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart", VVS). Between Bempflingen and Tübingen, they are coordinated by the Neckar-Alb-Danube Transport Association ("Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb-Donau", Naldo).

MV Blue Puttees

MV "Blue Puttees" (ex-"Stena Trader") is a Ro-Pax passenger/vehicle ferry operated by Marine Atlantic between the islands of Newfoundland and Cape Breton in eastern Canada. She is named after the nickname of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.
Largely built in Russia, her assembly was finished in Norway. As part of Stena Line she regularly ran between The Netherlands and the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2009. After being leased by Marine Atlantic, she was taken to Bremerhaven, Germany to be converted so as to better suit the North Sydney to Channel-Port aux Basques route, which she would be taking over. This conversion included the addition of a third bow thruster, increase and renovation of the passenger areas, and shortening of the vessel by 12m to help facilitate docking at Channel-Port aux Basques. She entered regular passenger service with Marine Atlantic in early March 2011. Her nearly identical sister ship followed her into service a few weeks later.
Incidents and accidents.
On July 31, 2013, "Blue Puttees" ran aground after missing a turn in the harbour of Port aux Basques. The vessel managed to free herself at high tide. Following an underwater inspection, it was discovered that "Blue Puttees" had suffered damage to her bulbous bow, and would have to be taken out of service to allow repairs to take place at a drydock in Halifax. She was returned to service on August 20, 2013.
