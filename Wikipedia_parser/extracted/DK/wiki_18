Wanstead Park

Wanstead Park is a grade II listed municipal park covering an area of about 140 acres (57 hectares), located in Wanstead, in the London Borough of Redbridge, historically within the county of Essex. It is bordered to the north by the A12 road, to the east by the River Roding and A406 North Circular Road, to the south by the Aldersbrook Estate and the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium and to the west by Wanstead Golf Course. It is administered as part of Epping Forest by the City of London Corporation, having been purchased by the Corporation in 1880. Today's park once formed part of the deer park of the former manor house of ancient Wanstead Manor, which included much of the urbanised area now known as Wanstead. In order to understand the history of today's municipal park of Wanstead, the history of the ancient manor of Wanstead needs to be examined. For this purpose the modern green spaces of the Park, golf course and Wanstead Flats should be considered as one entity.
History of the Manor of Wanstead.
Roman Wanstead.
Ordnance Survey maps mark the site of a Roman Villa in present day Wanstead Park. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1985 indicated a Roman presence here from the 1st to the 5th century AD, but did not locate any specific site of a Roman villa. A mosaic discovered in 1715 by gardener Adam Holt measured "... from north to south ... 20 feet, and from east to west about 16; that it was composed of small square brick tesserae of different sizes and colours, as black, white, red, &c., of all which I have specimens; that there was a border about a foot broad went, round it, Composed of red dice, about ¾ of an inch square, within which were severall ornaments, and in the middle the figure of a man riding upon some beast and holding something in his hands; but, as he opened it onely in a hurry, and in different places, he was able to give no bettor account of it." (Smart Lethieullier, Aldersbrook, July 12, 1735). According to Lethieullier, the pavement "was situated on a gentle gravely ascent towards the north, and at a small distance from the south end of it I remember a well of exceeding fine water, now absorbed in a great pond". Lethieullier's first letter mentions "foundations", which he believed to be Roman, at some distance to the south of the pavement, and on the very edge of the Wanstead estate "about 300 yards due south from the said well and pavement, there were, in my memory, the ruins of foundations to be seen, though now destroyed by planting trees round the park pales". A second letter also mentions the "foundation of a Roman building", "at a small distance" from the site of the pavement. Lethieullier goes on to state that in the summer of 1746 workmen showed him "urns" "of the coarsest earth" and bones they had discovered, which he believed to be the remains of Roman burials, as well as at least three coins. 
The exact locations of the Roman remains described by Smart Lethieullier were subsequently lost although Jack Elsden Tuffs undertook further archaeological work during the 1960s. A limited ground penetrating radar survey was undertaken in February 2007 running north-south to a point just north of the refreshment hut and showed anomalies consistent with the buried foundations of a large masonry building running diagonally across the survey area. What appeared to be at least two rooms were visible which are considered likely to date from the Roman period.
Saxon Wanstead.
The name Wanstead is probably of Saxon origin - indicating a possible continuity of settlement here since Roman times - and is accepted by the English Place-Names Society as derived from "Wen", signifying a hill or mound, and "Stead", a place. It is said that in Saxon times Abbot Aelfric granted the manor of Wanstead to the monks of Westminster Abbey yet this cannot be substantiated from any documentary evidence. However, the location was clearly a prized site on the east side of London.
Norman Wanstead.
In 1086 the Domesday Book states that Wanstead Manor was held from the Bishop of London by one Ralph son of Brian. Wanstead was then densely wooded, being situated within the Forest of Essex. It was part of the forest bailiwick of Becontree during the Middle Ages and later of the Leyton "Walk".
Tudor Wanstead.
The manor house, known as Wanstead Hall, was probably quite a small building until the 14th century, but by 1499 it was large enough to serve as a royal hunting-lodge, when it was acquired by King Henry VII, one of whose favourite resorts it was to become. Henry had developed a taste for privacy towards the end of his reign, and acquired Wanstead as a "maison de retraite" in the vicinity of Greenwich Palace, laying out considerable sums on it. It was valued by him especially for its park, bringing the King much needed seclusion. It is also interesting to note that Henry VII used Wanstead as a location for receiving payments from what the Tudor historian David Starkey calls his “slush fund” of extra-parliamentary taxation and fines, away from the eyes of the magnates in the formal royal palaces. The young future Henry VIII lived for a while at Wanstead and at the other "maison de retraite" of Hanworth in enforced proximity to his father Henry VII during the last years of his reign. Both kings hunted within the manor. It was during Henry VIII's reign (1509–1547) that Wanstead Park was inclosed, shortly before 1512, which probably involved the clearance of some wooded areas. At about this time neighbouring Aldersbrook became a separate manor. Wanstead remained a Royal manor for a number of years, its “keeper” being an office awarded to favoured royal courtiers, one after another. Hugh Denys (d.1511) Groom of the Stool to Henry VII was its keeper until 1511, being one of the King's key financial officers who often received the “slush fund” monies there on the King's behalf. On Denys's death in 1511 the keepership passed to Charles Brandon, later Duke of Suffolk. Sir John Heron, another former financial officer within the Privy Chamber, was keeper of the park until his death in 1521. Heron also held lands in Aldersbrook and it is said that he brought heron birds to the area, as an amusing mark of his presence. One of the lakes was historically known as "Herony (sic) Lake". (A heronry, i.e. colony of heron birds, is shown on Lincoln Island on an OS map of 1919, unless this is merely a confusion over the nomenclature of the lakes.) Lord Richard Rich, High Chancellor of England, was keeper of the park in 1543, and in 1549 Edward VI granted him the lordship of the manor of Wanstead, complete with the park. In 1577 Rich's son Robert sold it to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who purchased the nearby manor of Stonhall in Ilford at the same time. Thereafter a succession of owners kept the manor of Wanstead combined with Stonehall.
Jacobean Wanstead.
In 1619 Sir Henry Mildmay was in possession, but forfeited the manor to the Crown at the end of the Civil War, in which he had fought for Parliament. Charles II granted the estate to his brother, James, Duke of York, but it was restored in about 1662 to Sir Robert Brooke, Mildmay's son in law. In 1673-4 the manor was purchased by Josiah Child (created 1st Baronet Child of Wanstead in 1678)' Governor of the East India Company. He spent much time and money in developing the estate according to the fashion of the time. When John Evelyn, the diarist, visited Wanstead in March, 1683 he wrote: "I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in planting walnut trees about his seate, and making fish ponds many miles in circuit in Epping Forest, in a barren place." The ponds which he mentioned, although somewhat altered, are those in existence at the present day - a chain of ponds descending from the Shoulder of Mutton Pond, through Heronry Pond, Perch Pond, the Dell and into the Ornamental Waters. Child died in 1699, and was succeeded by his son - also Sir Josiah Child - who leased Wanstead and Stonehall to his half-brother, Richard Child. On Sir Josiah II's death in 1704, Richard Child became 3rd Baronet, having succeeded to his title and estates.
Georgian Wanstead.
Construction of the Palladian Mansion.
In 1715 Sir Richard Child commissioned the Scottish architect Colen Campbell to design a grand mansion in the then emerging Palladian style, to replace the former house, and to rival contemporary mansions such as Blenheim Palace. When completed it covered an area of . by , the facade having a portico with six Corinthian columns, the earliest in England. The grounds were landscaped and planted with formal avenues of trees by George London, one of the leading garden designers of his day. Child was created 1st Viscount Castlemaine 3 years later in 1718, the house being completed in 1722. Child had married in 1703 Dorothy Glynne, whose mother was of the Tylney family of Tylney Hall in Rotherwick, Hampshire. On the death of Ann Tylney, her cousin, in 1730, Dorothy and her husband Viscount Castlemain inherited the Tylney estates. Castlemain was created 1st Earl Tylney the following year (1731) and in 1734 obtained an Act of Parliament to change the name of his family, including his heirs, from the patronymic to Tylney, probably to meet a condition of his wife's inheritance. On the death of the Earl in 1750 he was succeeded by his 38 year old son John Tylney, 2nd Earl Tylney, who continued the plantings, but in the then fashionable natural and non-formal style. The 2nd. Earl had no male issue and his estates passed on his death in 1784 to his elder sister Emma's son Sir James Long, 7th Baronet, who being then in possession of the vast estates of the Longs, the Childs and the Tylneys, assumed the surname Tylney-Long for himself and his descendants, again probably in accordance with a requirement of the inheritance. On the death of the 7th Baronet in 1794 the combined estate passed to his one year old infant son Sir James Tylney-Long, 8th Baronet, who died in 1805 aged just 11. The estate then passed to his young sister, eldest of three, Catherine Tylney-Long, who thereby became the richest heiress in England.
Entree of William Pole-Wellesley.
In 1812 Catherine took the disastrous step of accepting the marriage proposal from the later-to-be notorious rake, William Wellesley-Pole, nephew of two famous uncles, Richard Wellesley, 2nd Earl of Mornington, eldest brother of his father William, and Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington from 1813, his father's younger brother. It is likely the influence of the Wellesleys played a part in securing the marriage into their family of this great heiress. Shortly before the wedding Catherine's husband had changed his family surname to Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, probably as required by the marriage settlement trust, in which he was given a life interest. In 1814 Wellesley started his career of burdening the marriage settlement trust with debt by inviting the landscaper Humphrey Repton to improve the park, some of whose informal planting remains today.
Demolition of the Palladian Mansion.
Wellesley was an MP initially from 1812-19 but was principally known for his dissipation and extravagance. On his marriage the estate had been conveyed to a trust from which Catherine would receive £4,500 per annum for life, with the rest to the use of Wellesley for his life. The remainder was to go to the sons produced from the marriage. To secure a debt of £250,000, he managed to mortgage this marriage settlement trust, which owned Wanstead House and contents, to his creditors. In 1822, to escape his creditors, he obtained the office of Usher to George IV (himself experienced in profligacy and evading creditors) which rendered him immune to arrest for debt, and later he fled his creditors abroad. In June 1822 the trustees of the settlement, under a power contained within the trust and having obtained the requisite agreement of the couple, auctioned off the house's contents in an auction lasting 32 days, in order to pay off the incumbrances on the settled estate, thereby protecting the son's future inheritance. In 1825, having found no buyers for Wanstead House, the trustees demolished it under the same powers and applied the proceeds from the sale of the resultant building materials in a similar fashion. The sum raised was only £10,000 whilst it had reputedly cost around £360,000 to build. Catherine, having been abandoned for another woman by her husband in 1823, died in 1825 of an intestinal illness, shortly after the demolition, no doubt a broken woman.
Transformation into Municipal Park.
A life interest in Catherine's remaining lands, to the extent of , in surrounding Wanstead and the adjoining parishes of Woodford, Leyton, Little Ilford and Barking remained in the hands of her husband up to 1840. Before 1828 Wellesley in a search for money had cut down a great number of trees in the park, destroying many of the avenues, vistas and clumps so carefully planted earlier at such great expense by Sir Josiah Child and the Earls Tylney. He had marked a further 2,000 for felling when his son obtained an injunction in 1828 preventing him from proceeding, since it would damage the value of the land, his future inheritance. Wellesley challenged the injunction but it was confirmed against him in 1834. Wellesley continued his parliamentary career between 1830–32 and inherited his father's title as 4th Earl of Mornington (his father having inherited from his elder brother) in 1845, dying in humble lodgings in 1857. The remnant of the manor of Wanstead was inherited by his son William, who had been protected from his father's designs on his maternal inheritance by the intervention of the Duke of Wellington, and he left it in trust for his father's cousin Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley. In 1880 the Earl sold of Wanstead Park to the Corporation of London for preservation as a part of Epping Forest, and the resultant new municipal park of Wanstead was officially opened by the City of London Corporation in 1882. The Earl's family sold further land to Wanstead Sports Grounds Ltd. in 1920
Site of the former Palladian Mansion.
The site can best be studied by reference to a satellite photographic image, combined with the map of Wanstead House and grounds made by the landscaper John Rocque, printed in "Environs of London." Rocque had been commissioned in 1735 by 1st Earl Tylney to effect still further garden features aimed at turning Wanstead into a mini Versailles. The Palladian Mansion stood about 275 yards to the east of the large octagonal ornamental lake called the "Basin", due south of what is now the golf course club-house, built of brick and weather-boarded timber, a remnant of the 18th-century stable-court. The present cricket ground would therefore effectively have been part of the front lawn to the west of the house. The approach was from the entrance gates 1/3 mile due west, the piers of which still survive standing either side of Overton Drive at its junction with Blake Hall Road. Carriages would have proceeded easterly along Overton Drive, thus skirting the north side of the Basin, then following the contour of the lake southwards to arrive at the western front of the house. The extensive fruit and vegetable gardens originally situated to the south-east of the Great House have all gone, these now forming the links of the Golf Course. Two Walnut trees which died in the 1980s, the largest high and in girth, probably themselves planted by Sir Josiah Child, stood to the east of the Shoulder of Mutton pond. Thickets of Rhododendron recall the time when part of the Park was laid out as a shrubbery, traversed by the winding paths shown in Rocque's map. Remains of an impressive avenue of sweet-chestnuts, called Evelyn's Avenue, can still be traced in a south westerly direction from the basin, crossing Wanstead Flats and Bush Wood.
Wanstead Park today.
The western boundary of the present municipal park, named Wanstead Park, therefore lies some 330 yards east of the site of the mansion house. The park still retains some of its layout as the former grounds of Wanstead House. In 1992 a Management Plan was initiated to try to re-establish something of the formality of the grounds of a "Great House". Apart from the lake system, the most evident survivals are the buildings known as the Temple and the Grotto, both built in about 1760, (now listed buildings) and some “mounts” or artificial mounds. Less obvious, perhaps, is a group of islands known as the Fortifications, an amphitheatre, an ornamental canal and remains of some avenues of trees.
The Fortifications.
The Fortifications are situated on the Ornamental Waters about 800 yards east of the site of the mansion, to the south-east of the large Lincoln Island. They consist of eight small islands grouped in a circular pattern around a larger central island on which duck-shooting guns were formerly stored. The bridges by which they were once connected no longer exist. The islands are now somewhat overgrown, providing a sanctuary for water-birds.
Ornamental Canal.
The wide Ornamental Canal forms a continuation on the eastern far side of the River Roding, here called the Ornamental Waters, of the broad grassy ride cut through the woodland, known as the Glade, in a direct easterly line from Wanstead House. It therefore would have created a magnificent vista from the house, stretching 2/3. of a mile to the east. It was noted by Eric S. Wood F.S.A. (Collins Field Guide to Archaeology, Third Edition 1972) as being a "magnificent canal". (photo)
Gateposts.
One third of a mile due west of the site of Wanstead House stand two impressive stone piers, remnants of the gateway that formed the formal entrance to Wanstead House. They are embellished with the monogram of their builder, Sir Richard Child. The piers stand either side of Overton Drive at its junction with Blake Hall Road. The view of the house published in 1771 in Spencer's work would have been drawn from this gate.
Access to the Park.
The park is approached from Wanstead in the north via Warren Road. The road at the entrance to the Park is not under the management of the local council, and the un-surfaced section of it, which separates the park from the golf course, ends at a well known landmark by the Heron pond called the "Posts". Along the east side of the unmade road there are several entrances to the park. One leads to the Glade, the broad grassy ride noted above, which extends five hundred yards due east down to the Ornamental Pond. The other main entrance for pedestrians is at the north-east corner of the park, from Wanstead Park Road south of Redbridge tube station, via the footpath crossing the busy A406 North Circular Road.
Activities and events.
In late April the Chalet Wood is awash with flowering bluebells. The Temple is open every weekend with displays on the history of Wanstead Park including finds excavated from the 18th-century grotto and the 'Lost Roman Villa'. Entrance is free and there is also a shop offering free leaflets on Epping Forest, other guides and booklets, as well as traditional toys and other attractive items. The City of London Corporation runs a programme of events at the Temple and its surrounds, including family craft days, open-air theatre and musical performances. The City of London website provides further details. Another event is "Music in Wanstead Park", which is held at the beginning of summer. The event is organised by the Aldersbrook Families Association. Fishing is permitted on the Ornamental Waters and the Perch Pond, but only in season.

Take Me as I Am (Mary J. Blige song)

"Take Me As I Am" is a song by American recording artist Mary J. Blige taken from her seventh studio album, "The Breakthrough" (2005). It was written by producer Ron Fair along with three members of the writing team The Clutch, Ezekiel Lewis, Candice Nelson, and singer Keri Hilson. Co-produced by Infinity, it samples Lonnie Liston Smith's 1979 "Garden of Peace" from his 1979 album, "Dreams of Tomorrow", as written by Smith and Jordan Suecof. Released as the album's fourth single, "Take Me As I Am" debuted on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in August 2006, reaching number three.
Music video.
The video for the song, directed by Bille Woodruff, premiered on BET's "106 & Park" in September 2006. It peaked at number nine on the show's video countdown.
In "Take Me As I Am", Blige portrays different women in different life situations except for her alter ego, Brook Lynn, who plays Date Mary. As the video begins, Blige is a waitress/dishwasher getting her children ready for school and also trying to get her boyfriend / husband a job. Next, Blige is an editor during a photo shoot, in which a photographer is photographing Blige as a model. "Model Mary" is replaced with another model due to a tabloid report of a breakdown. "Editor Mary" is then sexually harassed by a corporate and walks out; while "model Mary" overdoses drugs in the bathroom of the photo shoot set, shortly after being replaced. In the restaurant which "Waitress Mary" works, Blige plays another character as well. This one is simply the girlfriend of a controlling boyfriend and is at lunch with her date. The date (Lance Gross) refuses to allow Blige to eat the appetizer bread, takes her menu from her and orders her a salad, clearly trying to personally control her weight. The date then gets up and appears to be flirting with a young woman in a pink dress. "Date Mary" (portrayed by Blige's alter ego, Brook Lynn) is checking her makeup and sees her date in the mirror reflection, then gets up and throws a glass of water in their faces, then leaves. Waitress Mary return homes after accidentally dropping food at work and kicks her lazy boyfriend out.

St. Patrick High School (Chicago)

St. Patrick High School is an all male college preparatory Catholic high school located in the Portage Park neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago, Illinois. Opened in 1861, it is among the oldest continuously open high schools in the Chicago area. The school is the oldest Catholic school in Chicago.
History.
The original school was opened by the Christian Brothers near Adams Street and Des Plaines. In 1953, the school moved to its current site, on Belmont and Austin avenues. The student population was bigger than anticipated, which required almost immediate addition to the new structure; a construction project completed for the 1956—57 school year.
In 1991, one floor of the school was redeveloped as a computer center. After a long term fundraising effort, further addition and remodeling took place with the addition of an atrium, theater, music facilities, media center, and a second smaller gymnasium.
Drug Testing Program.
In 2004, St. Patrick High School initiated a mandatory drug testing policy for all students. The policy calls for each student to be tested through hair samples at least once each year. Because of the random nature of the testing, some students may get tested more than once. Students who test positive are given the opportunity to work with the school to determine the best counseling route, but must submit to another test within 100 days, at the student's expense.
Student life.
Athletics.
St. Patrick's athletic teams are named the Shamrocks. The school participates in the East Suburban Catholic Conference (ESCC) for most of their sports, which include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. The school also sponsors teams in bowling, swimming & diving, and water polo which are not sponsored by the ESCC. All of these sports have state tournaments sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA).
The following teams have placed in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournaments:
The water polo team won the ISA state title in 1997, going 28–0. This was not an IHSA sponsored title, as water polo only became an IHSA sponsored sport in 2001.
Non-athletic activities.
The school also has an academic team, a chess team, band, FIRST robotics, and dance. The chess team finished second in the IHSA state chess tournament in 1977 and tied for third in 2008.
The cheerleading squad is composed of girls from nearby all-girls schools who choose to try out.
Theatre Department.
The school's Theatre Department stages one play in the fall, one musical in the spring, and one miscellaneous play in the summer as part of its Community Theater Initiative.

Avro Tutor

A.V. Roe's Type 621 Tutor was a two-seat British radial-engined biplane from the interwar period. It was a simple but rugged initial trainer that was used by the Royal Air Force as well as many other air arms worldwide.
Design and development.
The Avro Model 621 was designed by Roy Chadwick as an Avro private venture metal replacement for the Avro 504. Conceived as a light initial pilot trainer, the biplane design featured heavily staggered equal span, single-bay wings; the construction was based on steel tubing (with some wooden components in the wing ribs) with doped linen covering. A conventional, fixed divided main undercarriage with tail skid was used in all but the latest aircraft, which had a tail wheel.
The Model 621 was powered either by a 155 hp (116 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Mongoose or Armstrong Siddeley Lynx IV (180 hp/130 kW) or IVC (240 hp/179 kW) engine; later Lynx-powered models had the engine enclosed in a Townend ring cowling. The Mongoose powered version was called the 621 Trainer and the more numerous Lynx-engined aircraft the Tutor. The Tutor also differed by having a more rounded rudder.
The first flight of the prototype G-AAKT was in September 1929, piloted by Avro chief test pilot Captain Harry Albert "Sam" Brown.
Operational history.
Production was started against an order for three from the Irish Free State and 21 Trainers from the Royal Air Force. The RAF required a replacement for the wooden Avro 504, and after three years of trials against other machines such as the Hawker Tomtit it was adopted as their basic trainer, supplanting the 504 in 1933 and remaining in this role until 1939. As well as the 21 Trainers a total of 381 Tutors and 15 Avro 646 Sea Tutors were eventually ordered by the RAF. RAF units to operate the type in quantity included the Royal Air Force College, the Central Flying School and Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Flying Training Schools.
Subsequently, the Model 621 achieved substantial foreign sales. A.V. Roe and Co exported 29 for the Greek Air Force, six for the Royal Canadian Air Force, five for the Kwangsi AF, three for the Irish AF (where it was known as the Triton) and two for each of the South African and Polish AFs. In addition 57 were licence built in South Africa, and three licence built by the Danish Naval Shipyard.
A total of 30 Tutors were exported to the Greek Air Force and at least 61 were licence built in Greece by KEA. A number of Greek Tutors was incorporated in combat squadrons after Greece's entrance in WWII, used as army co-operation aircraft.
Known for its good handling, the type was often featured at air shows. Over 200 Avro Tutors and five Sea Tutors remained in RAF service at the beginning of the Second World War.
The 621 was designed as a military trainer and few reached the civil registers. In the 1930s, in addition to 10 prototypes and demonstrators, two were used by Alan Cobham's "Flying Circus" and two trainers were retired from the RAF into private use. One 621 was used from new by Australian National Airways. After the war another four ex-RAF 621s appeared on the civil register.
Survivors.
G-AHSA was used for communication duties during the Second World War, struck off December 1946 and purchased by Wing Commander Heywood. After suffering engine failure in the early stages of the filming of "Reach for the Sky", it was purchased by the Shuttleworth Collection and restored to flying condition.
Up to the end of 2003, G-AHSA was still flying as K3215 in RAF trainer yellow. Since January 2004 it has flown painted as K3241 in the colours of the Central Flying School. (The real K3241 built in 1933, served RAF College Cranwell, until transferred to the CFA in 1936.)

Type 88 Surface-to-Ship Missile

The Type 88 Surface-to-Ship Missile (88式地対艦誘導弾, SSM-1) is a truck-mounted anti-ship missile developed by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in the late 1980s. It is a land-based version of the air-launched Type 80 (ASM-1) missile; in turn it was developed into the ship-launched Type 90 (SSM-1B) missile. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force bought 54 transporter erector launchers, each carrying six Type 88 missiles, for use as coastal batteries. With a range of , high subsonic speed and warhead, it is similar to the US Harpoon missile.
Overview.
The basic configuration composes the same launcher vehicles and loader vehicles (6 SSM-1), some radar vehicles, fire control systems, and a command control system.
Usually, the SSM-1 is launched from within of the coast.
Media Portrayals.

Transverse metatarsal ligament

The transverse metatarsal ligament is a narrow band which runs across and connects together the heads of all the metatarsal bones; it is blended anteriorly with the plantar (glenoid) ligaments of the metatarsophalangeal articulations. 
Its plantar surface is concave where the Flexor tendons run below it; above it the tendons of the Interossei pass to their insertions. 
It differs from the transverse metacarpal ligament in that it connects the metacarpal to each other.

Smith &amp; Wollensky

Smith & Wollensky is the name of several high-end American steakhouses, with locations in New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Columbus, Las Vegas, Miami, Chicago, Boston and Washington D.C.. The first Smith and Wollensky steakhouse was founded in 1977 by Alan Stillman, best known for creating T.G.I. Friday's, and Ben Benson, in a distinctive building on 49th Street and 3rd Avenue (once occupied by Manny Wolf's Steakhouse). Many of the restaurants have a wooden exterior with its trademark green and white colors. The individual Smith and Wollensky restaurants operate using slightly varied menus. In 1997, Ruth Reichl, then-restaurant reviewer for the "New York Times", called Smith & Wollensky "A steakhouse to end all arguments.".
In 2007, Nick Valenti, CEO of the Patina Restaurant Group and his partner Joachim Splichal, together with the Boston-based private equity firm Bunker Hill Capital, purchased The Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group.
Name.
According to Stillman, there was never a Mr. Smith or a Mr. Wollensky involved. He opened the Manhattan phone book twice and randomly pulled out two names, Smith and Wollensky. The announcements for the opening, however, carried the names Charlie Smith and Ralph Wollensky. Stillman later admitted that Charlie and Ralph were the names of his dogs.
Locations.
New York.
Located in midtown Manhattan, the first S&W steakhouse occupies a stand-alone building whose wooden exterior bears the trademark green and white colors (which actually were inherited from Manny Wolf's, which was there from 1949-'77, when it became Smith & Wollensky, they simply changed the "Since 1949" to "Since 1977" but otherwise kept the type of letting used on the outside of Manny Wolf's the same). Also included is Wollensky's Grill, a bar room within the restaurant that has a more bar-type atmosphere and food, and is open later than the dining room. The New York location was used for a scene as a meeting place for Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe's characters in the 2000 Film "American Psycho". It and its kitchen were also used for scenes in the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada". It was also used for the famous 2008 $2.11 million and 2007 $650,100 "Power Lunch with Warren Buffett" charity auction on eBay, with Zhao Danyang and Mohnish Pabrai & Guy Spier, respectively.
When Mr. Stillman sold the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group he retained ownership of the New York restaurant, although all locations share promotional and marketing efforts.
Chicago.
Bearing the same green and white painted exterior the New York location has, this steakhouse overlooks the Chicago River and the Loop. It played a role in the revival of Chicago's River North area, and is neighbored by Marina City and the House of Blues. This location was featured in the 2006 film "The Break-Up".
Miami Beach.
In a two-story building on the waterfront, the S&W's Miami is technically located at the extreme southern end of Miami Beach, and offers views of the Miami skyline and ships passing through Government Cut into and out of the port of Miami. It takes advantage of its waterfront location, with an outdoor patio for diners to enjoy the outdoors.
Washington D.C..
Located at 1112 19th Street NW, near the corner of 19th and L in the heart of Downtown Washington, DC.
Las Vegas.
The restaurant has three floors and is across from the City Center on the Las Vegas Strip.
Philadelphia.
This restaurant has two floors and is the chief restaurant of Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Hotel. It overlooks Rittenhouse Square.
Columbus.
The restaurant opened in 2002 and is in the Easton Town Center "lifestyle community".
Houston.
The restaurant, which has two stories and features a view deck overlooking one of the nicer areas in the city in Highland Village, is similar to the Columbus location in that it was built as part of a "lifestyle community".
Boston.
The restaurant occupies the Armory of the First Corps of Cadets, a castle built in 1891 originally intended as a military building, and is the only Smith & Wollensky location on the National Register of Historic Places. Another Boston location is located on the waterfront near South Station.
Advertising.
Capitalizing on the restaurant's New York City roots, showmanship and creative risk have been perennial hallmarks of Smith & Wollensky's promotion from day one. An early TV commercial by agency Angotti Thomas Hedge showed waiters botching famous theatrical soliloquies ("To be or not to be") because they "wanted to be waiters, not actors." More recently, the steakhouse promoted itself with the theme "If steak were a religion, this would be its cathedral." Johann Sebastian Bach's uplifting Mass in B Minor backgrounds a rapid paced montage of patrons, food, waiters and wine. This commercial by Seiter & Miller Advertising was seen throughout New York City and most memorably featured on newly installed Taxi TV screens.

Pandanus amaryllifolius

Pandanus amaryllifolius is a tropical plant in the "Pandanus" (screwpine) genus, which is commonly known as pandan leaves (), and is used widely in Southeast Asian cooking as a flavouring. The characteristic aroma of pandan is caused by the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which maybe gives white bread, jasmine rice and basmati rice (as well as bread flowers "Vallaris glabra") their typical smell. The plant is rare in the wild but is widely cultivated. It is an upright, green plant with fan-shaped sprays of long, narrow, blade-like leaves and woody aerial roots. The plant is sterile, flowers only grow very rarely, and is propagated by cuttings.
Culinary use.
In Bangladesh it is called "ketaki", along with the other variety of pandan there ("Pandanus fascicularis"), and is used to enhance the flavor of "pulao", "biryani" and sweet coconut rice pudding, "payesh". It is called "pandan wangi" in Indonesian, "hsun hmway" () in Burmese, "pandán" in Filipino, "bai tooey" in Thai, "rampe" in Sinhala, "sleuk toi" in Khmer, "Daun Pandan" in Nonya cooking, "lá dứa" in Vietnamese, 香兰 ("Xiāng lán") in Chinese and बासमतिया पौधा pɑʊd̪ʱɑː "fragrant plant" in Magahi and Bhojpuri due to its fragrance.
The leaves are used either fresh or dried, and are commercially available in frozen form in Asian grocery stores in nations where the plant does not grow. They have a nutty, botanical fragrance which enhances the flavor of Indonesian, Singaporean, Filipino, Malaysian, Thai, Bangladeshi, Vietnamese, Chinese, Sri Lankan, Khmer and Burmese foods, especially rice dishes and cakes.
The leaves are sometimes steeped in coconut milk, which is then added to the dish. They may be tied in a bunch and cooked with the food. They may be woven into a basket which is used as a pot for cooking rice. Pandan chicken, (Thai: ไก่อบใบเตย, "kai op bai toei"), is a dish of chicken parts wrapped in pandan leaves and baked. The leaves are also used as a flavouring for desserts such as pandan cake and sweet beverages. Filipino cuisine uses pandan as a flavouring in "buko pandan" fruit salad, as well as rice-based pastries and numerous sweet drinks and desserts.
Bottled pandan extract is available in shops, and often contain green food coloring. The leaves also notably have a repellent effect on cockroaches.

Science attaché

A science attaché (also known as a scientific attaché or a technical attaché) is a member of a diplomatic mission, usually an embassy. A science attaché traditionally had three primary functions: advise the ambassador on scientific and technical matters, report scientific and technological events, and represent his or her country in scientific and technical matters to foreign scientific and technical academies, industry, and government bodies. A science attaché also helped forge formal ties between domestic and foreign scientists and researchers and acted as a catalyst for scientific exchange initiatives. The non-advising roles of the science attaché seem somewhat less important in the age of the internet and the truly international scientific community it has helped create.
Historical functions.
The role of U.S. science attachés was first outlined in 1950 in a report entitled "Science and Foreign Relations", issued by the U.S. State Department. It listed the primary duties of science attachés as:
Modern trends.
The modern trend seems to be to emphasize the advisory role of the science attaché over the facilitation of scientific and technical exchanges. As recently as 1998, the National Academy of Sciences called for the appointment of more science-savvy diplomats to the State Department to improve the quality of the scientific advice available to foreign policymakers. The panel also emphasized the need to encourage general foreign service staff to acquire scientific skills.
While there has been more emphasis on the advisory role, science attachés could still play a role in facilitating exchanges and collaborations by helping scientists from their home country understand the host nation’s science culture and practices. 
Formerly, being appointed science attaché was viewed as the "kiss of death" for advancement within the foreign service. However, with the growing importance of scientific issues such as global warming, global infectious diseases, and bioterrorism to foreign policymaking and diplomacy, this perception may be changing.

Sydney Granville

Sydney Granville (1880 – 27 December 1959) was an English singer and actor, best known for his performances in the Savoy Operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
After early theatrical work in musical comedy, straight plays and grand opera, he joined the D'Oyly Carte company, at first in the chorus, then in lyric baritone roles and finally in the comic bass-baritone parts of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With brief breaks when he performed for other managements, Granville was with D'Oyly Carte from 1907 to 1942.
Life and career.
Granville was born Walter Dewhurst in Bolton, Lancashire. His early stage appearances were on tour in a musical comedy entitled "Dorcas", a romantic drama, "The God of War", and in grand opera with the Moody-Manners Opera Company.
Early career – lyric baritone.
Granville joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company chorus in 1907, soon understudying the role of Lord Mountararat in "Iolanthe" at the Savoy Theatre in London. When the season ended, he toured with the company in the chorus and played the small role of Selworthy in the curtain raiser "After All!". The next season, at the Savoy, he played John Lloyd in Fenn and Faraday's "A Welsh Sunset", given as a curtain raiser to "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Pirates of Penzance", and he understudied Henry Lytton in the role of Dick Deadeye in "Pinafore".
On tour with D'Oyly Carte from 1908 to 1914, Granville played a variety of Gilbert and Sullivan roles, including the Counsel to the Plaintiff in "Trial by Jury", Boatswain in "Pinafore", Samuel in "The Pirates of Penzance", Colonel Calverley in "Patience", Strephon in "Iolanthe", Arac in "Princess Ida", Pish-Tush in "The Mikado", the Lieutenant of the Tower in "The Yeomen of the Guard", and Luiz in "The Gondoliers".
In March 1914, Granville left the company. He played in pantomime as the Demon Killjoy in "Cinderella" at the London Palladium. He rejoined D'Oyly Carte, during its 1915–16 tour, playing only Strephon and Luiz in a nine-opera repertoire. "The Manchester Guardian" commented on his neglect, "Mr. Sydney Granville, who has been heard too little, was a delightful Strephon." In the next season, he lost the role of Strephon to Leo Sheffield when the latter rejoined the company. Granville left D'Oyly Carte for the second time in 1917.
Following the death of the veteran D'Oyly Carte performer Fred Billington in November 1917, Sheffield took on most of his bass-baritone roles. A year later, Granville returned to play the lyric baritone roles that Sheffield had earlier played. These roles were the Counsel, Boatswain, Samuel, Strephon, Florian in "Princess Ida", Pish-Tush, the Lieutenant, and Luiz, later swapping the Counsel for the Usher in "Trial", adding the Colonel and later Grosvenor in "Patience", and swapping Luiz for Giuseppe in "The Gondoliers". In 1920, the critic Neville Cardus wrote of him, "As fine a Savoyard as any in the company, Mr. Sydney Granville acted and sang capitally. He has a rare instinct for the gauntness of the English ballad manner which is the secret of Gilbert's lyrical style ... also he never loses the suspicion of parody which so often underlines Sullivan's tunes." In 1921 Granville added to his repertoire the role of Cox in "Cox and Box", and by 1924, he had given up the smaller roles of Samuel and the Lieutenant. In 1925 he transferred to D'Oyly Carte's smaller touring company, playing Colonel Calverley in "Patience", Mountararat in "Iolanthe", the title role in "The Mikado", and Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in "Ruddigore".
Later career – "heavy" baritone.
In 1925 Granville left the company for the third time, touring in Australia and New Zealand with the J. C. Williamson organisation in 1926–27 in the Gilbert and Sullivan bass-baritone roles that he would later play with D'Oyly Carte. Returning to England in 1927, he made several radio broadcasts for the BBC, including "The Red Pen", "a sort of opera" by A. P. Herbert and Geoffrey Toye. He toured in Robert Stolz's musical "The Blue Train," and then played Lockit in "The Beggar's Opera", at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1928.
Granville rejoined the D'Oyly Carte company in 1928, replacing the retiring Leo Sheffield in the bass-baritone roles. Except during Sheffield's return for the 22-week London Season in 1929–30, Granville performed these "heavy" baritone roles until his retirement in December 1942. He played the Learned Judge in "Trial", the Sergeant of Police in "Pirates", Private Willis in "Iolanthe", Pooh-Bah in "The Mikado", Sir Despard Murgatroyd in "Ruddigore", and Don Alhambra in "The Gondoliers". He added Wilfred Shadbolt in "Yeomen" in 1929 and King Hildebrand in "Princess Ida" in 1931. In 1938, "The Observer" wrote that Granville "has worked up from stripling parts like Strephon to become, after twenty-five odd years, one of the great Savoy veterans." By 1939, he had given up the Judge and Willis.
"Granny," as he was known in the D'Oyly Carte company, was married to the chorister and small-part player Anna Bethell (known principally for playing Mrs. Partlett in "The Sorcerer" whenever it was revived. Bethell later served as stage director of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1947–49 and for the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Company.
Granville died in Stockport, Cheshire, in 1959 at the age of 79.
Recordings.
Granville was Pooh-Bah in the 1939 Technicolor film version of "The Mikado".
With D'Oyly Carte, he participated in the following HMV recordings of the operas: "H.M.S. Pinafore" (1922 – as Captain Corcoran and Boatswain), "Princess Ida" (1924 – Florian), "Iolanthe" (1929 – Private Willis), "Pinafore" (1930 – Boatswain), abridged Gondoliers (1931 – Don Alhambra), abridged Pirates (1931 – Sergeant), Ruddigore (1931 – Despard), abridged Yeomen (1931 – Shadbolt), and Mikado (1936 – Pooh-Bah).

Semi-structured model

The semi-structured model is a database model where there is no separation between the data and the schema, and the amount of structure used depends on the purpose.
The advantages of this model are the following:
The primary trade-off being made in using a semi-structured database model is that queries cannot be made as efficient as in a more constrained structure, such as in the relational model. Typically the records in a semi-structured database are stored with unique IDs that are referenced with pointers to their location on disk. This makes navigational or path-based queries quite efficient, but for doing searches over many records (as is typical in SQL), it is not as efficient because it has to seek around the disk following pointers.
The Object Exchange Model (OEM) is one standard to express semi-structured data, another way is XML.

<doc id="5876878" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5876878" title="History of Solidarity">
History of Solidarity

The history of "Solidarity" (, pronounced ), a Polish non-governmental trade union, begins on 14 August 1980, at the Lenin Shipyards (now Gdańsk Shipyards) at its founding by Lech Wałęsa and others. In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. It is considered to have contributed greatly to the fall of communism.
Poland's communist government attempted to destroy the union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.
In the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on Poland's political scene waned. A political arm of the "Solidarity" movement, Solidarity Electoral Action ("AWS"), was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary elections in 1997, only to lose the subsequent 2001 elections. Thereafter, Solidarity had little influence as a political party, though it did become the largest trade union in Poland.
Pre–1980 roots.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and of dissident movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within Soviet-influenced societies. There was declining morale, worsening economic conditions (a shortage economy), and growing stress from the Cold War. After a brief boom period, from 1975 the policies of the Polish government, led by Party First Secretary Edward Gierek, precipitated a slide into increasing depression, as foreign debt mounted. In June 1976, the first workers' strikes took place, involving violent incidents at factories in Płock, Radom and Ursus. When these incidents were quelled by the government, the worker's movement received support from intellectual dissidents, many of them associated with the Committee for Defense of the Workers (, abbreviated "KOR"), formed in 1976. The following year, "KOR" was renamed the Committee for Social Self-defence ("KSS-KOR").
On October 16, 1978, the Bishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła, was elected Pope John Paul II. A year later, during his first pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were attended by hundreds of thousands of his countrymen. The Pope called for the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces, he was a bellwether of change, and became an important symbol—and supporter—of changes to come.
Early strikes (1980).
Strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade. In July 1980, Edward Gierek's government, facing economic crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations, with the biggest strikes taking place in the area of Lublin. The first strike started on July 8, 1980 in the State Aviation Works in Świdnik. Although the strike movement had no coordinating center, the workers had developed an information network to spread news of their struggle. A "dissident" group, the Workers' Defence Committee ("KOR"), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major industrial centers. At the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, the firing of Anna Walentynowicz, a popular crane operator and activist, galvanized the outraged workers into action.
On August 14, the shipyard workers began their strike, organized by the Free Trade Unions of the Coast ("Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża"). The workers were led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at the shipyard late in the morning of August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.
The Polish government enforced censorship, and official media said little about the "sporadic labor disturbances in Gdańsk"; as a further precaution, all phone connections between the coast and the rest of Poland were soon cut. Nonetheless, the government failed to contain the information: a spreading wave of "samizdats" (), including "Robotnik" (The Worker), and grapevine gossip, along with Radio Free Europe broadcasts that penetrated the Iron Curtain, ensured that the ideas of the emerging Solidarity movement quickly spread.
On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee ("Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy", or "MKS"). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the "MKS" were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.
Next day, a delegation of "KOR" intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A "bibuła" news-sheet, "Solidarność", produced on the shipyard's printing press with "KOR" assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, "Mury" ("Walls"), gained popularity with the workers.
On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With "KOR" assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.
Thanks to popular support within Poland, as well as to international support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission ("Komisja Rządowa") including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement came to be known as the August or Gdańsk agreement ("Porozumienia sierpniowe"). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (Szczecin Agreement (August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement ("Porozumienia jastrzebskie") and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.
First Solidarity (1980–1981).
Encouraged by the success of the August strikes, on September 17 workers' representatives, including Lech Wałęsa, formed a nationwide labor union, Solidarity ("Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy (NSZZ) "Solidarność""). It was the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Its name was suggested by Karol Modzelewski, and its famous logo was conceived by Jerzy Janiszewski, designer of many Solidarity-related posters. The new union's supreme powers were vested in a legislative body, the Convention of Delegates ("Zjazd Delegatów"). The executive branch was the National Coordinating Commission ("Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza"), later renamed the National Commission ("Komisja Krajowa"). The Union had a regional structure, comprising 38 regions ("region") and two districts ("okręg"). On December 16, 1980, the Monument to Fallen Shipyard Workers was unveiled in Gdansk, and on June 28, 1981, another monument was unveiled in Poznan, which commemorated the Poznań 1956 protests. On January 15, 1981, a Solidarity delegation, including Lech Wałęsa, met in Rome with Pope John Paul II. From September 5 to 10, and from September 26 to October 7, Solidarity's first national congress was held, and Lech Wałęsa was elected its president. Last accord of the congress was adoption of republican program "Self-governing Republic".
Meanwhile Solidarity had been transforming itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a revolutionary movement. Over the 500 days following the Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union ("Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów", created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union ("NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych "Solidarność"" or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union. It was the only time in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. ""History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom,"" the Solidarity program stated a year later. ""What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic."" Tygodnik Solidarność, a Solidarity-published newspaper, was started in April 1981.
Using strikes and other protest actions, Solidarity sought to force a change in government policies. In some cases, as in Bielsko-Biała, Solidarity managed to force corrupt officials of the government to lose their jobs. At the same time, it was careful never to use force or violence, so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play. After 27 Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March 19, a four-hour warning strike on March 27, involving around twelve million people, paralyzed the country. This was the largest strike in the history of the Eastern bloc, and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings. This concession, and Wałęsa's agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided. Nonetheless the Polish communist party—the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)—had lost its total control over society.
Yet while Solidarity was ready to take up negotiations with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement as the only way out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.
Martial law (1981–83).
After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish government was under increasing pressure from the Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position. Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee put him in the minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.
On December 13, 1981, Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity, declaring martial law and creating a Military Council of National Salvation ("Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego", or "WRON"). Solidarity's leaders, gathered at Gdańsk, were arrested and isolated in facilities guarded by the Security Service ("Służba Bezpieczeństwa" or "SB"), and some 5,000 Solidarity supporters were arrested in the middle of the night. Censorship was expanded, and military forces appeared on the streets. A couple of hundred strikes and occupations occurred, chiefly at the largest plants and at several Silesian coal mines, but were broken by ZOMO paramilitary riot police. One of the largest demonstrations, on December 16, 1981, took place at the Wujek Coal Mine, where government forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing 9 and seriously injuring 22. The next day, during protests at Gdańsk, government forces again fired at demonstrators, killing 1 and injuring 2. By December 28, 1981, strikes had ceased, and Solidarity appeared crippled. The last strike in the 1981 Poland, which ended on December 28, took place in the Piast Coal Mine in the Upper Silesian town of Bieruń. It was the longest underground strike in the history of Poland, lasting 14 days. Some 2000 miners began it on December 14, going 650 meters underground. Out of the initial 2000, half remained until the last day. Starving, they gave up after military authorities promised they would not be prosecuted. On October 8, 1982, Solidarity was banned.
The range of support for the Solidarity was unique: no other movement in the world was supported by Ronald Reagan and Santiago Carrillo, Enrico Berlinguer and the Pope, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn, peace campaigners and NATO spokesman, Christians and Western communists, conservatives, liberals and socialists. The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity; dedicated organizations were formed for that purpose (like Polish Solidarity Campaign in Great Britain). US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies. Meanwhile the CIA together with the Catholic Church and various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and advice to the Solidarity underground. The political alliance of Reagan and the Pope would prove important to the future of Solidarity. The Polish public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for demonstrating support of Solidarity became masses held by priests such as Jerzy Popiełuszko.
Besides the communist authorities, Solidarity was also opposed by some of the Polish (émigré) radical right, believing Solidarity or KOR to be disguised communist groups, dominated by Jewish Trotskyite Zionists.
In July 1983, martial law was formally lifted, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late 1980s.
Underground Solidarity (1982–88).
Almost immediately after the legal Solidarity leadership had been arrested, underground structures began to arise. On April 12, 1982, Radio Solidarity began broadcasting. On April 22, Zbigniew Bujak, Bogdan Lis, Władysław Frasyniuk and Władysław Hardek created an Interim Coordinating Commission ("Tymczasowa Komisja Koordynacyjna") to serve as an underground leadership for Solidarity. On May 6 another underground Solidarity organization, an "NSSZ "S"" Regional Coordinating Commission ("Regionalna Komisja Koordynacyjna NSZZ "S""), was created by Bogdan Borusewicz, Aleksander Hall, Stanisław Jarosz, Bogdan Lis and Marian Świtek. June 1982 saw the creation of a Fighting Solidarity ("Solidarność Walcząca") organization.
Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an exclusively underground organization. Its activists were dogged by the Security Service ("SB"), but managed to strike back: on May 1, 1982, a series of anti-government protests brought out thousands of participants—several dozen thousand in Kraków, Warsaw and Gdańsk. On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. On that day, communist secret services killed four demonstrators – three in Warsaw and one in Wrocław.
Another wave of demonstrations occurred on August 31, 1982, on the first anniversary of the Gdańsk Agreement (see August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland). Altogether, on that day six demonstrators were killed – three in Lubin, one in Kielce, one in Wrocław and one in Gdańsk. Another person was killed on the next day, during a demonstration in Częstochowa. Further strikes occurred at Gdańsk and Nowa Huta between October 11 and 13. In Nowa Huta, a 20-year old student Bogdan Wlosik was shot by a secret service officer.
On November 14, 1982, Wałęsa was released. However on December 9 the "SB" carried out a large anti-Solidarity operation, arresting over 10,000 activists. On December 27 Solidarity's assets were transferred by the authorities to a pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions ("Ogólnopolskie Porozumienie Związków Zawodowych", or "OPZZ"). Yet Solidarity was far from broken: by early 1983 the underground had over 70,000 members, whose activities included publishing over 500 underground newspapers. In the first half of 1983 street protests were frequent; on May 1, two persons were killed in Kraków and one in Wrocław. Two days later, two additional demonstrators were killed in Warsaw.
On July 22, 1983, martial law was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released. On October 5, Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Polish government, however, refused to issue him a passport to travel to Oslo; Wałęsa's prize was accepted on his behalf by his wife. It later transpired that the "SB" had prepared bogus documents, accusing Wałęsa of immoral and illegal activities that had been given to the Nobel committee in an attempt to derail his nomination.
On October 19, 1984, three agents of the Ministry of Internal Security murdered a popular pro-Solidarity priest, Jerzy Popiełuszko. As the facts emerged, thousands of people declared their solidarity with the murdered priest by attending his funeral, held on November 3, 1984. The government attempted to smooth over the situation by releasing thousands of political prisoners; a year later, however, there followed a new wave of arrests. Frasyniuk, Lis and Adam Michnik, members of the ""S"" underground, were arrested on February 13, 1985, placed on a show trial, and sentenced to several years' imprisonment.
Second Solidarity (1988–89).
On March 11, 1985, power in the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev, a leader who represented a new generation of Soviet party members. The worsening economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev to carry out a number of reforms, not only in the field of economics ("uskoreniye") but in the political and social realms ("glasnost" and "perestroika"). Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.
On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish political prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested during the previous years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność ("Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność")—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council was admitted to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee (Solidarity)|National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność ("Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność") was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.
By 1988, Poland's economy was in worse condition than it had been eight years earlier. International sanctions, combined with the government's unwillingness to introduce reforms, intensified the old problems. Inefficient government-run planned-economy enterprises wasted labor and resources, producing substandard goods for which there was little demand. Polish exports were low, both because of the sanctions and because the goods were as unattractive abroad as they were at home. Foreign debt and inflation mounted. There were no funds to modernize factories, and the promised "market socialism" materialized as a shortage economy characterized by long queues and empty shelves. Reforms introduced by Jaruzelski and Mieczysław Rakowski came too little and too late, especially as changes in the Soviet Union had bolstered the public's expectation that change must come, and the Soviets ceased their efforts to prop up Poland's failing regime.
In February 1988, the government hiked food prices by 40%. On April 21, a new wave of strikes hit the country. On May 2, workers at the Gdańsk Shipyard went on strike. That strike was broken by the government between May 5 and May 10, but only temporarily: on August 15, a new strike took place at the "July Manifesto" mine in Jastrzębie Zdrój. By August 20 the strike had spread to many other mines, and on August 22 the Gdańsk Shipyard joined the strike. Poland's communist government then decided to negotiate.
On August 26, Czesław Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, declared on television that the government was willing to negotiate, and five days later he met with Wałęsa. The strikes ended the following day, and on November 30, during a televised debate between Wałęsa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions), Wałęsa scored a public-relations victory.
On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee ("Komitet Obywatelski") was formed within Solidarity. It comprised several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wałęsa and the majority of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wałęsa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.
On January 27, 1989, in a meeting between Wałęsa and Kiszczak, a list was drawn up of members of the main negotiating teams. The conference that began on February 6 would be known as the Polish Round Table Talks. The 56 participants included 20 from ""S"", 6 from OPZZ, 14 from the PZPR, 14 "independent authorities", and two priests. The Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw from February 6 to April 4, 1989. The Communists, led by Gen. Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the structure of political power. Solidarity, while hopeful, did not anticipate major changes. In fact, the talks would radically alter the shape of the Polish government and society.
On April 17, 1989, Solidarity was legalized, and its membership soon reached 1.5 million. The Solidarity Citizens' Committee ("Komitet Obywatelski "Solidarność"") was given permission to field candidates in the upcoming elections. Election law allowed Solidarity to put forward candidates for only 35% of the seats in the Sejm, but there were no restrictions in regard to "Senat" candidates. Agitation and propaganda continued legally up to election day. Despite its shortage of resources, Solidarity managed to carry on an electoral campaign. On May 8, the first issue of a new pro-Solidarity newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza ("The Election Gazette"), was published. Posters of Wałęsa supporting various candidates, appeared throughout the country.
Pre-election public-opinion polls had promised victory to the communists. Thus the total defeat of the PZPR and its satellite parties came as a surprise to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.
These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism.
The new Contract Sejm, named for the agreement that had been reached by the communist party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president. However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczysław Rakowski, failed to gain enough support to form a government.
On June 23, a Solidarity Citizens' Parliamentary Club ("Obywatelski Klub Parliamentarny "Solidarność"") was formed, led by Bronisław Geremek. It formed a coalition with two ex-satellite parties of the PZPR — United People's Party and Democratic Party — which had now chosen to "rebel" against the PZPR, which found itself in the minority. On August 24, the Sejm elected Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity representative, to be Prime Minister of Poland. Not only was he a first non-communist Polish Prime Minister since 1945, he became the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern Europe for nearly 40 years. In his speech he talked about the "thick line" ("Gruba kreska") which would separate his government from the communist past By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed.
Party and trade union (1989 to the present).
The fall of the communist regime marked a new chapter in the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated the communist government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.
Later that month, Wałęsa announced his intent to run for president of Poland. In December 1990, he was elected president. He resigned his Solidarity post and became the first president of Poland ever to be elected by popular vote.
Next year, in February 1991, Marian Krzaklewski was elected the leader of Solidarity. President Wałęsa's vision and that of the new Solidarity leadership were diverging. Far from supporting Wałęsa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.
The 1991 elections were characterized by a large number of competing parties, many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered only 5% of the votes.
On January 13, 1992, Solidarity declared its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against a proposal to raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May 19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion—which passed—against the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. President Wałęsa declined to accept the prime minister's resignation, and dismissed the parliament.
It was in the ensuing 1993 parliamentary elections that it became evident how much Solidarity's support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland's living standards to those in the West, and the government's financial "shock therapy" (the Balcerowicz Plan) generated much opposition.
In the elections, Solidarity received only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% less than the 5% required in order to enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer than in the previous Senate). The victorious party was the Democratic Left Alliance ("Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej" or "SLD"), a post-communist left-wing party.
Solidarity now joined forces with its erstwhile enemy, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions ("OPZZ"), and some protests were organized by both trade unions. The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over the state of the Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as "policja") using batons and water cannons. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wałęsa in the 1995 presidential elections.
In a second major defeat for the Polish right wing, the elections were won by an "SLD" candidate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm still managed to pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the "SLD" voting against). Meanwhile the left-wing "OPZZ" trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, twice as many as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).
In June 1996, Solidarity Electoral Action ("Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność") was founded as a coalition of over 30 parties, uniting liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic forces. As the public became disillusioned with the "SLD" and its allies, "AWS" was victorious in the 1997 parliamentary elections. Jerzy Buzek became the new prime minister.
However, controversies over domestic reforms, Poland's 1999 entry into NATO, and the accession process to the European Union, combined with "AWS"' fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—"Unia Wolności") and infighting within "AWS" itself, as well as corruption, eventually resulted in the loss of much public support. "AWS" leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections "AWS" failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.
In 2006, Solidarity had some 1.5 million members making it the largest trade union in Poland. Its mission statement declares that Solidarity, "basing its activities on Christian ethics and Catholic social teachings, works to protect workers' interests and to fulfill their material, social and cultural aspirations."

Bryan Watson (ice hockey)

Bryan Joseph Watson (born November 14, 1942) is a retired Canadian ice hockey defenceman. He played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, Oakland Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins, St. Louis Blues, Washington Capitals and the Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey Association. Watson also served as head coach and an assistant coach with the Edmonton Oilers during the 1980-81 NHL season.
Playing career.
Montreal Canadiens (1963-65).
Watson worked his way up through the Montreal Canadiens system starting his junior hockey career with head coach Scotty Bowman and the Peterborough Petes. He would eventually become team captain of the Petes and would be named the team's MVP in his final junior campaign. Watson continued and signed a contract with the Montreal Canadiens, making his NHL debut in the 1963-64 NHL season. He would play just over half the season in his rookie year appearing in 39 games with the big club and playing 6 more games in an opening round series vs. the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Stanley Cup playoffs. In Watson's sophomore season he only appeared in 5 games with Montreal, spending the bulk of the season with the AHL's Quebec Aces where head coach Bernie Geoffrion paired the 21 year old blueliner with 39 year old veteran Doug Harvey.
Detroit Red Wings (1965-67).
Watson left the province of Québec when the Canadiens traded him to the Chicago Black Hawks on June 8, 1965. Watson was the property of the Blackhawks for one day before the Detroit Red Wings selected him in the intra-league draft on June 9, 1965. In 1965-66, in his first year with the Red Wings he didn't miss a game, dressing for all 70 regular season contests. A season in which he scored his first NHL goal and led the team in penalty minutes. He would also appear in all 12 playoff games for Detroit, scoring the only 2 post-season markers of his career and helping the Red Wings advance to the Stanley Cup Finals against his former team the Montreal Canadiens. In 1966-67 Watson split his time between the Red Wings and Detroit's farm team in the CPHL, the Memphis Wings.
Montreal Canadiens (1967-68).
1967-68 would be an eventful year for Watson as it marked his return, albeit very briefly, to the organization and system he started his career with. This was also an eventful and historic year for the National Hockey League. The Original Six era officially came to an end at the start of the 1967-68 season as Clarence Campbell and the league, who had awarded new NHL franchises to six American cities, made their inaugural appearances that year. With six new teams, the Philadelphia Flyers, Minnesota North Stars. Oakland Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins, St, Louis Blues and Los Angeles Kings needing players, the NHL held an expansion draft in Montreal, Quebec. The draft would see the six new teams filling their rosters by picking from a specified pool of players who the original six teams made available to be selected. As a result, Watson was left unprotected by the Detroit Red Wings and Wren Blair and the Minnesota North Stars selected him with their 15th pick in the draft. That same day Blair shipped Watson back to Montreal by making a four player deal with Sam Pollock, with the Canadiens shipping three young prospects, Billy Plager, Leo Thiffault and Barrie Meissner to Minnesota in return. Back in Montreal for the second time, Watson would only appear in a dozen games with the Canadiens in 1967-68, registering just 1 assist and 9 penalty minutes. He found himself back in the minors playing a handful of games for the Cleveland Barons in the AHL and the bulk of the year in the CPHL for the Houston Apollos, with his second stint coming to an end at the conclusion of the 1967-68 season.
Oakland Seals and the Pittsburgh Penguins (1968-74).
During the summer, at the end of the 1967-68 season, Watson became the property of his second expansion team in just over a year when he was dealt by Sam Pollock to the Oakland Seals on June 28, 1968 for Tom Thurlby and a 1st round draft pick in 1972. After playing the first 50 games for the Seals in the 1968-69 season Watson was on the move yet again, becoming the property of his third expansion team in a year and a half. Oakland general manager Frank Selke, Jr. orchestrated a six player swap with the Pittsburgh Penguins that included Watson going the other way. With the move to Pittsburgh, he would find his first semi-permanent home, spending parts of the next 6 seasons in Steeltown. Watson would have the best offensive season of his career as a Penguin, scoring a career high in goals (3) and points (20) in 1971-72. He would follow that up by leading the Penguins in penalty minutes in 3 of his 4 full seasons with the club, finishing second behind fellow pugilist and namesake Bryan Hextall's 133 PIM in 1970-71. It was in Pittsburgh where Watson would just barely serve his longest tenure with one team in the NHL, donning the baby blue and white jersey of the Penguins for 304 of the 878 games he would play in the National Hockey League (302 with Detroit).
Detroit Red Wings (1974-76).
In 1973-74, after starting the season in Pittsburgh and a very brief 11 game stop with the St. Louis Blues, Watson found himself back in Detroit for the second time in his career. In his second season back with the Red Wings he would record a career high 322 penalty minutes in 1975-76, posting the second highest total in the league behind Steve Durbano's 370 PIM. His second go-round with the Red Wings would be his second to last stop in the NHL.
Washington Capitals (1976-79).
Watson joined the Washington Capitals a few weeks into the 1976-77 regular season when he was traded for Greg Joly, a former highly touted junior prospect who was drafted 1st overall by the Capitals in the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft from the Regina Pats of the WHL. Over the course of the next three seasons in the nation's capital, he would play 155 games and rack up another 294 minutes in penalties as a Capital. After appearing in 20 games with the Capitals in 1978-79, Watson left the NHL to join the Cincinnati Stingers of the fledgling World Hockey Association where he would end his professional career as a player, playing out the remainder of the season with the Ohio based franchise. 
In 878 career NHL games, Watson scored 17 goals, 135 assists, and amassed 2,212 penalty minutes.
Coaching career.
Watson's only season and final season as a player in the WHA would also be the last season of operation for the league as a whole. By seasons end, with the WHA reduced to only 6 teams in 1978-79, the league ceased to operate at the end of the year. Four teams from that league merged into the NHL for the start of the 1979-80 NHL season. The Hartford Whalers, Winnipeg Jets, Quebec Nordiques and the Edmonton Oilers, with head coach Glen Sather, all made their NHL debut's that year. The Oilers, with phenom Wayne Gretzky and 18 year old Mark Messier, qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs their first season in the NHL. After being swept by the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington promoted head coach Glen Sather and named him the teams new President and General Manager. In 1980-81, with the Oilers in need of a new bench boss, Watson got the nod and was named head coach of the Edmonton Oilers to start the franchise's second season in the NHL. However, after the Oilers posted a record of 4 wins, 9 losses and 5 ties to start the season Sather decided to go back behind the bench, with Watson remaining on as an assistant with Billy Harris. The Oilers went on and qualified for the playoffs for the second straight season, sweeping the heavily favoured Montreal Canadiens in the first round three games to none. The Oilers lost their best-of-seven series against the New York Islanders in the second round, which also brought an end to Watson's association with professional hockey as he would not return behind the Oilers bench the following year. Watson retired from hockey and returned to the Washington D.C area where he finished his NHL playing career and where he still resides today.
Personal life.
In 1983, Watson and his wife Lindy opened "Bugsy's Pizza Restaurant and Sports Bar" in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

Beaver Creek Indians

The Beaver Creek Indians are a state recognized tribe located in South Carolina, USA. They achieved state recognition on January 27, 2006 and are seeking federal recognition. The tribe formally organized as a non-profit organization in 1998 to seek official recognition.
The people were recorded on historical lands are between the two forks of the Edisto River in Orangeburg County, and especially along Beaver Creek. Historical accounts document the tribe in this area since the 18th century. Most of the tribe members live in the area. They have traditionally farmed (it is a rural area) or held jobs within the local community. 
The tribe's historical language family was Siouan, one of the major languages connecting them to such tribes of the Piedmont region as the Pee Dee and Catawba. Today all members speak English. Common family names within the tribe are: Chavis, Hutto, Williams, Barr, Bolin, Jackson, Huffman and Gleaton.
Government.
The tribe is governed by a Chief (Louie Chavis) and a Vice Chief (Kenneth Adams), and an elected Tribal Council of nine members. An Elders Council of five members also provides consultation and advice. The tribe's current headquarters is in the town of Salley, South Carolina.
Lazarus Chavis.
Lazarus Chavis (b. 1767 - d. after 1830) has been identified as the tribe's earliest known ancestor. He and his descendants are the central figures in the tribe's history, identity, and genealogy. Documentation of his life in numerous sources enabled the tribe to achieve state recognition in the 21st century, because records showed he identified as Indian. This provided proof that the people had a continuity of cultural and ethnic identity after the American Revolutionary War and through times of change. 
Chavis lived during a time when Native Americans were treated poorly, and most of those remaining in South Carolina were left landless after populations were decimated by infectious disease, slavery and warfare during the English colonial period. While some Native Americans denied or tried to hide their ethnicity in order to assimilate with majority culture, he identified openly as Indian. He was recorded as such in numerous legal documents. Records indicate he served in the American Revolutionary War and received a pension for the military service. He is also listed in the first U.S. Federal Census of 1790 and every census after that through 1830. 
Because his Native American ethnicity is documented through multiple and unrelated sources, his life demonstrated continuity of identity through early colonial and republican history. Such documentation was critical for the tribe's achieving state recognition in the 21st century. As Chavis was the foundation of the tribe's legal existence, he has come to define the extent and limits of its ancestry. Today he is defined as the common ancestor for all the members of the tribe. To be a member of the tribe, an individual must demonstrate direct descent from Chavis.

Orange Judd

__NOTOC__
Orange Judd (July 26, 1822 – December 27, 1892) was an American agricultural chemist, editor, and publisher.
Background and family.
Judd was born of a rural family near Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York. His grandfather, also named Orange Judd (1763–1844), came from Tyringham, Massachusetts and served as a private in the Berkshire Militia in the Northern Campaigns. His father, Ozias Judd, fought at Black Rock in 1813. Orange Judd's mother was Rheuama Wright, daughter of David Wright who was a private in the New York Militia during the Revolution.
Judd married twice, first to Sarah L. Ford of Boston in 1847, with whom he had four children, three of which died soon after birth, and again to Harriet Stewart of Lockport, New York, with whom he also had four children. His daughter from his first marriage, Sarah Ford, married George Brown Goode in 1877.
Orange Judd's brother, David Wright (1838-1888), was also successful and kept close connections to Orange. Wright was the editor and proprietor of "The Hearth and Home", one of Judd's periodicals under his publishing firm Orange Judd and Company. By 1883 Wright had become president of the company. Prior to that in 1871 he had also been elected as a Republican to the New York legislature.
Education and early career.
In 1847 Judd graduated from Wesleyan University. After graduating he would take on several teaching positions, first at a high school in Portland, Connecticut in 1847, then at Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts from 1848 to 1849, then as a principal of a high school in Middletown, Connecticut in 1850. In 1850 he began studying analytical and agricultural chemistry at Yale for the next three years with John Pitkin Norton. In 1852 he took a job lecturing on agriculture in Windham County, Connecticut until 1853. Judd recalled that his chemistry research at Yale lowered much of his hope for the science, deeming that "much of the so-called agricultural science is yet unreliable." Judd still sought a way to bring the latest research to farmers, but was nevertheless skeptical of much of it.
In 1853 he was made editor of the "American Agriculturist" (sometimes referred to as the "American Agriculturalist"), then run by its founders, Anthony B. Allen and his brother Richard L. Allen. He became owner and publisher in 1856. In 1856 Judd moved to Flushing, New York where he lived until 1871. Judd championed the idea of clear and concise writing in journals, and was able to turn a paper of scientific jargon into something any literate farmer was able to understand. Editors would obtain scientific material from colleges and would evaluate it and make it accessible for their readers. He was also one of the first people to practically apply opinion polls—sending out questionnaires on crop reports to his subscribers between May and September and publishing the results in the "American Agriculturist". His success helped make "American Agriculturist" into one of the leading agricultural journals in the nation, going from a circulation 1,000 in 1856, to over 100,000 in 1864. However the paper was hard hit by the depression of 1873, and was failing by 1879. He would stay there until 1881, alongside being the agricultural editor of the New York Times from 1855 to 1863. He became the principal member of the firm Orange Judd and Company, located in Chicago, which focused on publishing agricultural and scientific books, as well as "The Hearth and Home" from 1870 to 1873.
Later life.
Judd traveled in Europe in 1862, and in 1863 he served on the United States Christian Commission in Gettysburg, then in 1864 with the United States Sanitary Commission, later with the Army of the Potomac. However he was later brought home due to illness where he reached almost the point of death. In 1866 he became president of the Alumni Association of Wesleyan, a position he held until 1881. He again traveled to Europe in 1871 with his family through numerous countries. From 1868 to 1869 he became president of the New York, Flushing, and North Side Railroad, as well as the New York and Flushing Railroad, in which he became actively engaged in their construction efforts.
Around this time he began to take a greater interest in the affairs of Wesleyan University. He edited their first edition of the "Alumni Record". In 1871 the Orange Judd Hall of Natural Science was opened through his own work, and held the office of trustee from 1871 to 1881. They would also create the first agricultural experiment station in the country there through his donations. In September 1888, The Orange Judd Publishing Company bought another agricultural journal, James Hill's "The Farmer", which was in financial trouble. Judd moved it to Chicago and renamed it the "Orange Judd Farmer". However by 1891 Judd still owed Hill $15000, and all correspondence between them would later cease. He also became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. After 1871 Judd changed his place of residence rather frequently, moving several times between Flushing and New York City, and spending time in Middletown, Connecticut. On account of his poor health he also made a stay in Florida and lived for a time in Europe. Judd died in 1892 in Evanston, Illinois.

Devan Dubnyk

Devan Dubnyk (born May 4, 1986) is a professional ice hockey goaltender who plays for the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers in the first round (14th overall) of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Dubnyk was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, but grew up in Calgary, Alberta.
Playing career.
Minor.
Dubnyk spent his junior career with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Between 2001 and 2006 he played in 192 games for the Blazers, compiling an 83-87-14 record, 2.70 goals against average (GAA), .911 save percentage and 15 shutouts. In 2004 he was named the CHL Scholastic Player of the Year as the major-junior player best able to combine success on the ice and in school.
Professional.
Dubnyk began his professional career in 2006 with the Stockton Thunder of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) where he compiled a strong 24–11–7 record. His 24 wins, 2.56 GAA and .921 save percentage set club records and he was selected to be an ECHL All-Star for the 2006–07 season. In 2007–08 Dubnyk began to play full-time for what was then Edmonton's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. In three seasons with the Falcons, Dubnyk played 128 games, compiling a 40–75–4 record. In 2008–09, Dubnyk set a club record for most appearances by a goaltender with 62.
Dubnyk was called up to the Oilers early in the 2009–10 season after Oilers starting goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin underwent season-ending back surgery. For the remainder of the season he served as back-up to Jeff Deslauriers. Dubnyk made his first NHL appearance on November 28, 2009, replacing Deslauriers in a 7–3 loss to the Vancouver Canucks. Dubnyk allowed 3 goals on 24 shots. It took him until March 19, 2010, to register a win, and it came via a shootout versus the Detroit Red Wings. Dubnyk made 31 saves in the win. On March 21, 2010, Dubnyk recorded the first regulation win of his career, making 27 saves in a 5–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks.
On July 13, 2010, The Oilers re-signed Dubnyk to a two-year contract. The 2010–11 season was Dubnyk's first full season in the NHL and it proved a busy one. He entered the season as the full-time back-up to Nikolai Khabibulin, but injuries to Khabibulin combined with strong play from Dubnyk resulted in the latter registering over 30 starts. He finished the season with a 12–13–8 record on a last-place Oilers squad, impressing the Oilers coaching staff. Oilers coach Tom Renney summed up Dubnyk's season: "As much as we had an idea of how much we wanted to play him, we've played him more, and he's made the best of it." On February 7, 2011, Dubnyk earned his first career shutout by stopping 37 shots in a 4–0 win against the Nashville Predators. He closed out his season by earning back-to-back wins against the President's Trophy winning Vancouver Canucks, stopping 46 of 47 shots against in the process.
On October 9, 2011, Dubnyk started his first career season opener, by beating the Pittsburgh Penguins 2–1 in the shootout, while stopping 35 shots in the process.
Dubnyk struggled at the beginning of the 2011–12 NHL season posting 4 wins in his first 13 games, along with a 3.03 goals against average, and a 0.902 save percentage. Allowing Nikolai Khabibulin to steal the show, but as Khabibulin started to struggle, Dubnyk got more starts. Dubnyk had a strong second half of the season. Dubnyk earned his chance to be the starting goaltender in the month of March, posting a 6–2–1 record with a 1.95 GAA, and a .934 save percentage, and started in 12 of the Oilers last 13 games, and hasn't surrendered more than 3 goals in 20 straight games. Also winning 16 of the Oilers final 17 games.
On July 6, 2012, Dubnyk signed a 2-year, $7m contract extension. In the 2012–13 NHL season, Dubnyk for the first time opened the year as the Oilers starting goaltender, with a year to be mentored by Nikolai Khabibulin, who was his final year under contract with Edmonton. During the lockout shortened 2012–13 NHL season, with Dubnyk as the starter, the Oilers finished 12th in the Western Conference and missed the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season. Dubnyk however played relatively well, ending the season with a 2.57 GAA and .920 save percentage in 14 wins and 22 losses, his best career NHL numbers to date, sufficient enough to earn him a second year to be a starter. However, Dubnyk struggled to begin the 2013-14 NHL season, and faced a threat to his starting job by newly signed Ilya Bryzgalov. However, Bryzgalov was hurt in just his third game for the Oilers, temporarily solidifying him as the starter.
However, on January 15, 2014, Dubnyk tenure with the Oilers ended when he was traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for forward Matt Hendricks. After starting in only two games as a Predator, Devan was sent to the minors on March 3, 2014 to make room for Pekka Rinne returning from LTIR.
On March 5, 2014, Dubnyk was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in return for future considerations from the Nashville Predators. He was then assigned to AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs.
On July 1, 2014, Dubnyk signed a one year deal with the Arizona Coyotes.
International.
He was a member of Team Canada at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Vancouver, though he did not see any action behind starter Justin Pogge, who backstopped Canada to the gold medal.
Dubnyk was named to the Canadian roster for the 2010 IIHF World Championship, though he did not see any action in the tournament.
At the conclusion of the season Dubnyk was named to the Canadian roster for the 2011 IIHF World Championship in Slovakia. Dubnyk appeared in only one game for Canada, stopping all 8 shots he faced in limited action against France.
Shortly After finishing his season with the Oilers, Dubnyk was named to the Team Canada roster for the 2012 IIHF World Championship in Finland and Sweden. Serving as a backup to Cam Ward, Dubnyk made his tournament debut against Team France. He made 19 saves on 21 shots as Canada defeated France 2-7. 5 days later, he made his second appearance in the tournament against Team Kazakhstan, earning a shutout in an 8-0 victory. This is also the last game that Dubnyk started in the world championships as he would backup Cam Ward the next game against Team Slovakia, a quarterfinal match which Canada lost to the Slovaks.
During the 2012 NHL Lockout, Dubnyk was named to participate in the 2012 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland. The news comes after Dubnyk's 8 month break from hockey, majorly due to the NHL work stoppage. Along with fellow NHL goaltender Jonathan Bernier, Dubnyk shared net duties during the tournament round robin. After an overtime loss by Team Canada to Adler Mannheim in their tournament debut, Dubnyk started the next match against HC Davos. He stopped 25 shots on net in the shutout effort as Canada wins 5-0 to clinch a spot in the semifinals. Later he would face HC Fribourg-Gottéron in the semifinal match, he stopped 25 shots on goal to lead Canada to a 5-1 victory. In the final game, Dubnyk once again got the call against HC Davos as starting goaltender after 2 stellar performances in the tournament. Canada would eventually win the final by a score of 7-2, thanks to a part of Dubnyk's performance (28 saves on 30 shots).

New Zealand DM class electric multiple unit

The New Zealand DM/D class (also known as English Electrics) were a class of electric multiple units used on the Metlink suburban rail network of Wellington, New Zealand. Formed of DM power cars and D trailer cars, the first units were ordered from English Electric in 1936 and introduced on 2 July 1938 operating the electrified Johnsonville Line service. Additional units were ordered in 1942 and 1946 as other Wellington suburban lines were electrified.
The units were relegated to peak services and the Johnsonville Line after the arrival of the "Ganz Mavag" EM/ET units in 1982-83, before finally being replaced by the "Matangi" FP/FT units in 2011-12. The units operated their last revenue service on 25 June 2012, from Wellington to Melling and return. Five complete units (four two-car and one three-car) and six trailer cars have been preserved.
Introduction.
Built by English Electric, they were introduced in 1938 by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) following the opening of the Tawa Flat deviation of the North Island Main Trunk - the section of the old NIMT from Wellington to Johnsonville became the Johnsonville Line from 2 July. Ordered in 1936, the first six motor cars and trailers inaugurated the service. Due to traffic growth, three more motor cars and two more trailers were ordered in 1942 and placed into service in 1946.
Forty more motor cars and 71 trailers were ordered in 1946 for an expansion of suburban services on the Upper Hutt line. They were supplied from 1949 and were used on the Paekakariki service, as the Hutt Valley electrification was not then completed. However this required the use of prewar wooden carriages with electric locomotives in peak periods on the Hutt line until the EM/ET units were supplied.
Operation.
The class operated in two configurations:
The class were amongst the oldest rolling stock operated by KiwiRail. The last units in service were the 46 stock introduced in 1949 to 1954 - 36/42 stock were withdrawn in the early 1980s.
Technical details.
Motor cars have 54 seats and trailers 70 seats (originally 56 and 72 seats). Originally there was a double seat alongside the driver's cab. During renovations this seat was removed, reducing the seating by two, and a barrier was installed level with the back of the cab.
Some motor cars had the double seats in the rear section in front of the luggage compartment removed and the seats parallel with the sides extended to provide space for prams.
Motor cars originally had a driver's cab at each end, but extra space was needed in the luggage compartment and the cab there was removed. Initially a single motor car had been used on the Johnsonville line for the all-night service, and this was considered for the Melling line.
Each car had ten 150 V electric heaters in series run off the 1500 V supply, so a 1500 V connection was required between motor cars and trailers.
46 stock differed from 36/42 stock in some respects:
Because of their shorter wheelbase and the smaller motor-generator set designed for one trailer only, 36/42 stock units were kept for the Johnsonville line as much as possible.
Refurbishment.
The introduction of the EM/ET class units in the early 1980s saw a large number of the class become redundant, namely all of the '36 and '42 stock. Ten two-car units of '46 stock were refurbished at the now closed East Town Railway Workshops in Wanganui between 1984 and 1986 for continued operation on the Johnsonville Branch where EMs did not have running rights due to their being overgauge and having insufficient braking capacity, and for peak-hour running on the Hutt Valley and Melling lines.
In the early 2000s, the remaining members of the class underwent a moderate refurbishment to extend their operational lives to 2012. The refurbishment largely involved a cosmetic upgrade of the exterior and interior of the cars, with new seating and a major mechanical overhaul. As part of this the cars received the new two-tone Tranz Metro blue livery with the exception of DM 556 and its trailer cars D 2130 and D 2411 which were repainted into the old Midland Red livery with silver roof and black running gear in 2006. Trailer until D 2660 was sent to Hillside Workshops for an overhaul in 2002.
In February 2007, overcrowding of Wellington trains resulted in the recommendation by the Greater Wellington Regional Council to re-introduce two DM/D units, one former Tranz Metro units being used for spares and another from the Ferrymead Railway. These units entered service from October 2008. Six ex-British Rail carriages rebuilt at Hillside Workshops as the SE class and top-and-tailed by EO locomotives were also used.
Withdrawal.
Due to the arrival of the 44 EM/ET sets, withdrawals of the D/DM class units began in November 1981 with the scrapping of pioneering set DM 55 and trailer D 2007 (DM 1 and D 101). Further scrappings until July 1983 when the last two sets of 1942 stock were withdrawn for scrapping, while the 1936 stock had all been withdrawn and scrapped by April of that year. Only one of the 1946 sets had been withdrawn - motor coach DM 13 had been withdrawn and scrapped in April 1978 after being involved in an accident.
Final withdrawal.
The DM/D class were progressively replaced from January 2011 into 2012 by the new Matangi units. The first DM/D set operations to be given to the Matangis were services operated by the class on the Hutt Valley line, which saw some three-car sets initially withdrawn. By late 2011, the only three-car sets in service were DM 251, DM 504 and DM 556 "Cyclops". The latter soon had a trailer car removed and was seconded to Johnsonville Line services, leaving the other two the only three-car sets in service. Both DM 251 and DM 504 continued relatively trouble free in service (compared to the Johnsonville Branch EE's) until 27 March 2012, when both were suddenly withdrawn from service after the evening peak services that day.
Due to the nature of operations on the Johnsonville Branch and the need to increase the catenary voltage for full Matangi operation, operations on the branch needed to be cut over from one type to the other rather than phased in progressively. This caused some issues as the delay of Matangi units into service pushed this date further back than had been planned, and a marginal voltage increase had already occurred to allow Matangi units to be tested on the line, which caused the older D/DM sets to suffer electrical failures such as blown fuses or burnt out resistor grids. As two-car sets deteriorated in condition or suffered large mechanical problems they were withdrawn from service, and in some cases a good trailer from one set and a good motor car from another were matched up to create a good set from two bad ones.
By October 2011, enough two-car Johnsonville sets had been withdrawn to require two-car red sets DM 27 and DM 216 "Phoenix" (which had been used on Hutt Valley services) to be drafted into service on the Johnsonville line to maintain the timetable. Both these sets could only run with each other on the line, as they were electrically incompatible with the other two-car Johnsonville sets. By late December, DM 216 "Phoenix" suffered mechanical failure and was withdrawn, with DM 556 "Cyclops" shortened to a two-car set to replace DM 216 "Phoenix". Due to a lack of driving equipment and headlights in the DM motor car on 556, the set was coupled to the uphill end of DM 27 with these two operating in this same configuration until the end of services on the line.
Further failures of units saw the line only having one two-car set available for traffic at one stage but further repairs saw DM's 182, 441 and 510 maintaining the services along with DM 27 and DM556 "Cyclops". The peak timetable required six two-car sets, however for the remainder of the use of EE's on the branch only five were used with one two-car set operating some services where two would normally be used. Eventually, the Greater Wellington Regional Council had to supplement the trains on the line with buses at morning peak.
The final Johnsonville Branch services to be operated by the DM/D class ran on 19 March 2012. The train, consisting of DM 27 and DM 556 and driven by Phil Gibbs, crossed FP/FT 4155 and another Matangi set at Ngaio where impromptu speeches were held to farewell the trains, which subsequently arrived back at Wellington late. This also happened to be the last time both DM 27 and DM 556 "Phoenix" ran in service, both being withdrawn following the final run. Due to issues surrounding noise using Matangi units on the Johnsonville line, three test trains were run with two two-car DM/D sets; the last of these being run on 15 June 2012 using sets DM 441 and DM 510.
The final English Electric revenue service was the 14:39 Melling to Wellington service on 25 June 2012. Departing Wellington Station's Platform 9 at 14:17, DM's 182, 441 and 510 ran as train 5648 to Melling before returning to Wellington as train 5649, where they were retired from service, ending 74 years of English Electric service in Wellington.
Later on 25 June, an English Electric unit was listed on TradeMe, with a start price of $29,990. Initially thought to be a hoax, the train was 'bought' by a four-year old who clicked on the 'Buy Now' for the train. The train was later sold for $30,000 on 2 July 2012 at 1:42pm when the auction closed. At the time no numbers had been given for the train sold as GWRC had nine two-car sets awaiting sale or scrap. The set purchased was eventually revealed as motor car DM 562 and trailer D 2149, which arrived in Nelson on 21 August 2012, after being transported by road from the Wellington railway yards onto the Interislander ferry the following day.
Final scrapping of the 12 remaining units (14 D and 11 DM cars) is believed to have begun at Hutt Workshops just after 18 December 2012, starting with a mix of DM and D cars, before in January concentrating on the D class trailers and followed by the DM power cars. It was announced on 23 January that the three-car DM 556 "Cyclops" set was put aside for the Wellington Heritage Multiple Unit Preservation Trust, while the two-car DM 216 "Phoenix" set was put aside for preservation by the National Railway Museum of New Zealand. Trailer D 2826 was also put aside to be moved to Belgrove to join DM 562 and D 2419, converting it to an impromptu three-car set in the same way as the original three-car D/DM/D sets.
Scrapping of the D and DM cars at Hutt was completed on 31 January 2013, with motor car DM 297 being the last to be scrapped.
Liveries.
The DM class has worn five distinctive liveries during their working lives:
Royal Blue
The original livery of the DM and D class cars, introduced in 1938. This livery was replaced with standard "Midland Red" by 1949. The car body was painted in Royal Blue with a white band along the side below the windows and grey roof. The traction equipment and running gear were painted black, but were concealed under skirting until the war years when maintenance staff had them removed for ease of access. The car numbers were painted in gold on a black background, while on the side they were painted inside a red oval, similar to the cab-side numberplates on NZR locomotives.
The Royal Blue colour has been noted for its similarities to the MAXX Blue used in Auckland.
Midland Red
The best-known livery, all cars of the DM and D classes wore the "Midland Red" livery at one time during their working lives. When the EM/ET class was introduced in the early 1980s in an olive paint scheme, the red of the DM/D class became a distinguishing feature and they came to be nicknamed "old reds" and "red sets" in New Zealand railfan jargon.
The car body and skirting over the traction equipment was painted in "Midland Red" with the roof in grey and separated from the red body by a black strip and black underfloor equipment and running gear. In 2008 KiwiRail required the car fronts to be repainted in yellow for better visibility at level crossings. Car numbers were painted in gold on a black background, but were later replaced by solid white numbers during the TMS era. By this time, the livery was confined to three 'heritage' sets only and had been applied to all other cars during their successive repaints into other liveries.
The last set in regular service to retain the "Midland Red" livery was DM556 and trailers D2130 and D2411. When it was refurbished in 2006, it was named "Cyclops" due to its single-lens headlight and repainted externally in the "Midland Red" livery with gold car numbers as per the 1950s. This earned Tranz Metro a "Business in Conservation" award from the New Zealand Department of Conservation and the Wellington Conservation Board the same year. This livery was applied to DM 27 and D 163 from Ferrymead and DM216 and D2687 in 2008 when they were returned to service.
Olive and Cream
Originally introduced on the EM/ET class sets, several of the DM/D sets refurbished for the Johnsonville Branch were later repainted in this livery during the late 1980s. The car body was repainted in olive green with a grey roof and black underfloor equipment and running gear. A white band surrounded the windows on the sides of the car, ending between the first passenger window and the driver's cab window. The doors and ends were painted yellow with white block numbers and classification letters on the side and black numbers on the '1' and '2' ends of the train. The cab windows and headlight mounting were painted with a black surround.
These sets were branded for New Zealand Rail's suburban operator Cityline, and carried the Cityline branding and logo under the central four windows on the car body side. The NZR logo was painted in front of the car numbers at either end. Following the sale of NZ Rail Ltd to Wisconsin Central and the rebranding of suburban services as Tranz Metro, the NZR logos and Cityline branding were deleted and replaced with the Tranz Metro logo in the place of the former Cityline branding.
Tranz Metro "Cato Blue"
This livery was applied to set DM 147 by Tranz Rail's suburban operator Tranz Metro during the late 1990s, and was the only unit to wear this livery. The car body was painted in the standard Tranz Rail "Cato Blue" with a grey roof, yellow ends and headlight mount, and black underfloor equipment and running gear. The doors were unpainted aluminium while there were two black bands on the car body, one at floor level separating the running gear and underfloor equipment from the "Cato Blue" body and the other at roof level separating the grey roof from the blue body.
Standard Tranz Metro logos were applied along the centre of the car sides. The car numbers were painted in black Frutiger script on the ends of the car, underneath the left-hand tail lamp. The end numbers were painted in the same style on the centre of the cab doors.
Tranz Metro Two-tone Blue
Starting in 2005, Tranz Metro (now owned by Toll Rail) undertook a major refurbishment of the DM/D sets. As part of this, DM 297 and D 2778 were painted in a new two-tone livery which would later be used on all sets with the exception of the three 'heritage' units. The car body was "Cato Blue" with a grey roof and headlight mount, yellow cab fronts and black underfloor equipment and running gear. There was a Royal Blue window band along the side of the cars, while a black strip separated the grey roof colour from the car body. The passenger doors were unpainted aluminium, and white overhead hazard stickers were applied to the cab doors. Car numbers were painted on the cab-mounted horn covers in dark blue descending Frutiger script, although some had different sized lettering or a serifed font.
Preserved units.
As of 2013, five English Electric sets had been preserved by individuals or railway societies. Two of the sets are fitted with the original single headlights while three are rebuilt sets featuring the later twin-beam headlight units:
Six D class trailer cars have also found alternative use:

Lunar Escape Systems

Lunar EScape Systems (LESS) were a series of emergency vehicles designed for never-flown long-duration Apollo missions. Because these missions were even more hypothetical than the planned cancelled Apollo missions, the designs were never constructed. This concept was an outgrowth of the Lunar Flying Vehicle designed by Bell Aerospace (a lunar surface mobility design that was cancelled in favor of the less risky Lunar Rover).
Details.
As NASA planned for longer stays on the Moon after the first few Apollo flights, they had to consider a number of new issues, one of which was what to do if you cannot get back. Typically the longer a spacecraft is idle the less reliable it becomes, so after a stay of two weeks on the Moon the Lunar Module ascent engine or other essential systems might fail to function, leaving the astronauts stranded on the Moon without enough supplies to survive until a rescue mission could arrive from Earth.
For one possible solution NASA studied a number of low-cost, low-mass 'Lunar Escape Systems' (LESS) which could be carried on the Lunar Module as a backup, rather like a lifeboat on a ship.
'KISS' was the order of the day, with a few basic assumptions about any operational LESS system:
Other issues were that the LESS had to be as light as possible so as not to significantly reduce the cargo capacity of the LEM, and easy to pack into the LEM in such a way that it would not interfere with the other cargo. One consequence was that most designs used detachable legs: the legs would be set up on the lunar surface, the LESS assembled on top of them, and the legs then left behind as the LESS launched. This did not directly reduce the mass required, but it did reduce the empty mass of the LESS, which reduced the fuel required to lift it to orbit, which also reduced the thrust required from the engines and the total mass of the design.
The LESS would pack flat in the side of the LEM descent stage, and arms and wires would be provided to allow controlled removal of the LESS and ensure it did not harm the astronaut who was removing it. A protective cover also doubled as a sled, so the LESS could be pushed or pulled along the ground to reach a safe launch position prior to assembly. The assembly operations were expected to take at least forty-five minutes, with a further two hours for checkout and fuelling before launch. On long-duration missions the crew might assemble the LESS early in the mission as a precaution.
Given the cut-down nature of the LESS compared to a typical spacecraft of its era, the primary differences between designs were in propulsion, guidance, navigation and control.
Propulsion.
Typical LESS designs used flexible fuel tanks so that it could fold flat for storage. When the LESS was connected to the LEM ascent stage, the flexible tanks would be filled and expand to their full size ready for flight.
Some LESS designs used a single engine under the center, but many used multiple engines around the edge, typically based on the Apollo reaction control system (RCS) thrusters used for attitude control on the Command/Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM or LEM). These had a thrust of around each, so putting eight thrusters in pairs at the corners of a square gave enough thrust to lift two astronauts to orbit.
Another benefit of the RCS-based designs was that the RCS thrusters could be fired in bursts as short as ten milliseconds, so instead of complex throttling hardware they could simply be pulsed to adjust the average thrust over time. They could also be used to provide attitude control by varying the firing rate of different thrusters around the edge of the LESS.
Guidance.
Guidance in typical LESS designs was simple: an 'eight-ball' to show spacecraft attitude, a clock to show time since liftoff, and a pre-planned pitch program. The Apollo Guidance Computer used as an autopilot for the CSM and LEM had a mass of around a hundred pounds and consumed a significant amount of power, so computer controlled flight was out of the question. This would be one of the few cases where an astronaut flew a rocket manually all the way to orbit, and with far less instrumentation than normal.
The astronauts would wait until the appropriate liftoff time that would put them into an orbit close to the CSM, then launch. The pilot would attempt to hold a constant heading, and at pre-determined times during the burn he would adjust the pitch to pre-determined angles. This controlled the vertical and horizontal velocity of the LESS and consequently the orbit that it would enter: the engine would be shut down at a pre-determined time when they should have reached the correct orbit.
Fortunately, even if the pilot made a few errors on the way to space, that was not necessarily fatal. The CSM had a fuel reserve, and plans would allow it to change velocity by a maximum of around 250 meters per second in order to rendezvous with the LESS after orbit insertion. While that did not allow much change in orbital inclination, the CSM could significantly change orbital altitude to match the LESS. The biggest threat from piloting errors was that the crew would run out of oxygen before the CSM could reach them.
The LESS would be equipped with a flashing light and VHF radio beacon to simplify tracking from the CSM. On reaching the rendezvous point the CSM pilot would dock with the LESS using the same docking probe that was used to dock with the LEM, and a special attachment on the front of the LESS. This would require some skilled flying on the part of the pilot, as any use of the front-facing RCS jets could present a serious hazard to the astronauts on the LESS if the hot exhaust gases hit them.
Once docked the CSM pilot would depressurise the Command Module and open the hatch to space, so the astronauts on the LESS could use the external hand-holds on the Command Module to crawl to the hatch and climb inside. The crew would then separate the CSM from the LESS and leave it in lunar orbit when they returned to Earth.
Navigation.
There was no mass or power available in the LESS for an Inertial Measurement Unit to measure acceleration and tell the astronauts where they were, where they were going or how fast they would be getting there, or even for a radar altimeter to show altitude above the lunar surface.
In deep space this would have made navigation difficult, but fortunately the astronauts were close to the lunar surface, so other options were available. Most plans called for the astronauts to use landmarks on the lunar surface to control their heading while the pitch program took care of altitude and velocity. By keeping the landmark in the correct position relative to the LESS, they would know they were on the right course. Some designs included a graduated screen in front of the pilot showing relative angle to lunar landmarks.
Control.
LESS attitude control varied widely among designs. Some used the main engine for attitude control by gimballing the engine nozzle to alter the direction of thrust. Others had multiple engines and could use relative throttling or pulse-rate to vary the thrust from the different engines and control attitude that way. A few used cold gas RCS thrusters where high-pressure gas (typically nitrogen) was released from nozzles to provide a small amount of thrust without endangering the crew with hot gas from a rocket thruster. Most provided the pilot with a simple control stick arrangement which would automatically adjust attitude based on pilot input.
For the true 'seat of the pants' feeling, however, the simplest designs had no attitude control system at all. Instead the pilot would stand during the flight, and simply lean backwards, forwards or side-to-side to move the center of gravity relative to the center of thrust of the fixed engine. As a result the offset thrust would cause the LESS to rotate until the astronaut returned to a neutral position and the center of gravity was again aligned with the engine thrust. Ultimately, however, this was considered to be less desirable than hardware control, particularly as it imposed significant constraints on vehicle thrust level and inertia... adding gimballing or relative engine throttling might actually simplify the design.
Long-Range Flyer.
While the LESS was designed primarily as a 'lifeboat' for the LEM crew, a simple rocket which could carry two astronauts would be beneficial in other areas too. The Lunar Rover allowed the astronauts to travel fairly quickly over a few miles, but an improved version of the LESS could allow rapid travel over much longer distances on rocket thrust.
By adding fixed legs, increasing structural strength to support landing stresses, supporting engine throttling or using a cluster of RCS engines that could be pulsed, and adding a long-range radio relay, the LESS design could be extended to become a long-range flyer (LRF). With around 1600 pounds of propellant from the LEM, the astronauts could travel forty to sixty nautical miles from the LEM to explore a wider area around the landing site. This would, for example, allow reconnaissance trips to potential future landing sites, and the LRF could also be used for orbital flight to return the crew to the CSM in an emergency.

Mikhail Lifshitz

Mikhail Aleksandrovich Lifshitz (; July 23, 1905, Melitopol, Tavria (Crimea) – September 28, 1983, Moscow) was a Soviet Marxian literary critic and philosopher of art. As an academic philosopher, Lifshitz served as an executive member of Soviet Academy of Sciences from 1975. In the early 1930s he was a close associate of György Lukács.
Biography.
Born on July 23, 1905 in Melitopol, a Crimean city then part of Imperial Russia, Lifshitz began higher education as an art student at the Vkhutemas state studios of higher art and technology in Moscow in the early 1920s. By the close of the decade, he had already developed strong disagreements with his classically oriented instructors. Electing to pursue an analysis of aesthetics from a fundamentally Marxist perspective instead, Lifshitz enrolled in Moscow's Marx-Engels Institute, where he first developed a working relationship with the great Marxist philosopher György Lukács in 1930.
By 1937, his productivity had decreased significantly; Lifshitz produced almost no published work in the repressive climate of the most intense years of Stalinism. Following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union Lifshitz entered the Second World War as a Red Army volunteer.
His post-war career as a critic was marked by considerable controversy. Lifshitz's mid- to late-1950s writings about socialism and the course of Soviet society in particular provoked the ire of the established figures of Soviet intellectual life: although Soviet publishers would continue to produce his work, Lifshitz's independence from the party's norms led to his expulsion as a member. The same time-frame was also a period of Lifshitz's collaboration with the Soviet philosopher Evald Ilyenkov.
Lifshitz's main object of criticism in the 1960s was the modernist movement in the arts. From a political vantage point, Lifshitz, despite his criticism of the Soviet system, remained a strong proponent of Marxist-Leninist socialism.
Lifshitz died in Moscow on September 28, 1983, eight years after his election to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious academic organization within the Soviet Union.
The vast majority of his work remains untranslated. One book on aesthetics, "The Philosophy of Art of Karl Marx", was published in the West in 1980.

Ranks of the AAFC

The ranks of the Australian Air Force Cadets (AAFC) are closely based on the ranks of the Royal Australian Air Force. As such, a system of differentiation was required to distinguish members of the AAFC from those of the RAAF. This means that cadet ranks wear rank slides which are AFB (Air Force Blue) with an embroidered light blue ribbon, 1 cm wide at the base of the rank slide with 'AAFC' in AFB embroidery. Adult members of the AAFC wear rank slides with an embroidered white bar that contains the letters AAFC in place of the light blue bar. Adult ranks are also followed by the letters AAFC (in brackets) when written, to distinguish them from actual members of the RAAF. Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer ranks are prefixed with the letter C, to identify them as cadets and not adult staff or members of the RAAF.
A new cadet is initially enrolled with the rank of Cadet and after completing prescribed training and length of service, they are eligible for reclassification to the rank of Leading Cadet. Subsequent promotions are achieved by completing two week training courses known as a promotion courses along with meeting time-in-rank and minimum age requirements and receiving a recommendation for promotion from the cadet's Commanding Officer.
Ranks and Abbreviations.
Roles & requirements of each staff rank can be found here. Roles of each cadet rank can be found here.
<br>
The ranks of the AAFC are as follows, in order from lowest to highest:
Cadet Ranks.
Junior Ranks.
Junior ranks comprise the ranks of Cadet (CDT) and Leading Cadet (LCDT) as well as the informal title of Recruit (RCT).
Cadets join the AAFC as recruits at the rank of Cadet (CDT) and commence Cadet Recruit Stage training which comprises the subjects Drill and Ceremonial, Service Knowledge, and Fieldcraft. Cadet Recruit Stage may include a teambuilding weekend or training weekend. Recruits receive their PH299 'blue book' (a form of identification carried at all times by cadets) and uniforms some time during Cadet Recruit Stage. Cadet Recruit Stage usually takes less than 1 month to complete.
Upon completion of the Recruit Stage of training, CDTs begin Basic Stage. Basic Stage, on average, takes 6 months to fully complete. By completing Basic Stage, a cadet will begin Proficiency Stage and is eligible for reclassification to the rank of Leading Cadet (LCDT). A LCDT rank slide features a single inverted chevron.
Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer Ranks.
Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) ranks are Cadet Corporal (CCPL), Cadet Sergeant (CSGT), Cadet Flight Sergeant (CFSGT) and Cadet Warrant Officer (CWOFF).
Any LCDT can apply for the Junior Non-Commissioned Officer Course. A cadet's Commanding Officer (CO) reviews the LCDT's application, and, if successful, endorses their application. This allows the LCDT to attend a promotion course (held during school holidays) conducted by their parent wing.
The Junior Non-Commissioned Officer (JNCO) courses generally last for 11 days and are held at a RAAF base, depending on availability. At the end of a promotion course, the course commander grades the LCDT as either recommended or not recommended for promotion to the rank of CCPL. If recommended for promotion, a CO should promote the LCDT to the rank of CCPL as soon as practicable.
Any CCPL can apply for the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course but must have held that rank for a minimum of five months before being able to attend the promotion course. They go through much the same process, though more rigorous, as do prospective JNCOs. SNCO courses typically last for 15 days and are also held at a RAAF base, often concurrently with a JNCO course.
Promotion is as for JNCOs. Having been recommended for promotion by the course commander, promotion is at the discretion of the CCPL's CO as soon as practicable.
After six months as a CSGT, a cadet may be promoted to the rank of CFSGT by their CO. This does not require the CSGT to attend a wing promotion course. Many COs require their prospective CFSGTs to demonstrate the ability to lead a team of SNCOs.
A Cadet Warrant Officer (CWOFF) is the most senior of the NCO ranks but most squadrons consider this to be a "Senior Cadet" due to the privileges and responsibilities it has.
In order to attend a CWOFF course, a cadet must be a SNCO and have completed their JNCO course not later than 16 months before the commencement of the CWOFF course.
The CWOFF course generally lasts for 15 days as well and are conducted at a RAAF base. CWOFF courses conducted by the AAFC primarily cover leadership and supervision particularly focusing on the maintenance of morale, cadet welfare and discipline. Due to the role of a CWOFF often being that of the Squadron Warrant Officer, the course has a significant weighting towards Drill and Ceremonial and service protocol.
Cadets promoted to the rank of CWOFF are addressed as Sir, Ma'am or Warrant Officer. Cadets, staff and defence personnel of a high rank generally will address the CWOFF by their rank and last name e.g. "Warrant Officer Bloggs", whilst subordinate ranks will address the CWOFF as Sir or Ma'am depending on their gender and, are too also allowed to address the CWOFF as "Warrant Officer Bloggs".
Senior Cadet Ranks.
The ranks of CWOFF and Cadet Under Officer (CUO) are usually considered to be senior cadet ranks due to large increase of duties and privileges the two ranks have.
In order to attend a CUO course, a cadet must be a SNCO and have completed their JNCO course not later than 16 months before the commencement of the CUO course. CUO courses are the longest, running for 17 days, also at a RAAF base.
The rank of CUO is the highest attainable by a cadet and is designed to give the cadet experience in the role of an officer. To this end, the course is heavy in leadership and management related subjects in addition to the drill required to be an officer.
CUOs are addressed by all cadets below their rank as Sir or Ma'am, as applicable, and are saluted.
Rank Establishments.
The AAFC has specific rank establishments depending on the strength of a squadron. This is to ensure a balance between leadership roles and subordinates members (especially to prevent a top-heavy squadron developing). As an exaggerated example, it would not be beneficial for a squadron of 40 cadets to have 39 CUOs and 1 CDT, nor would it be beneficial for it to have 20 CWOFFs, 10 CFSGTs and 10 CSGTs. Rather, that squadron ought to have 2 CUOs, 2 CWOFFs, 1 CFSGT, 3 CSGTs, 5 CCPLs and around 30 LCDTs/CDTs. The general standard is 1-4 NCOs and CUOs.
The following table outlines cadet establishments for AAFC squadrons:
Cadet Phases of Training.
A cadet progresses through five phases of training during their cadet career.
See Australian Air Force Cadets for a description of each training stage.
"Propeller" refers to a round gold pins with a propeller-blade symbol printed in service blue, worn centrally of the right breast pocket flap above the button.
Staff Promotion.
A person may be enrolled as an Instructor of Cadets (IOC) at the age of 18 and as an Officer of Cadets (OOC) at the age of 20, though most begin their career as an IOC. Ex-cadets are recommended to wait a minimum of one year before returning as a staff member.
Upon appointment as an IOC, the staff member is normally given the rank of AC/ACW(AAFC). Any new staff member who was previously a cadet and held the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer or Cadet Under Officer is eligible for and is usually given the rank of LAC/LACW(AAFC). Ex-ADF members may also be appointed at higher ranks than AC/ACW(AAFC), to recognise their previous rank/service in the ADF. Current ADF members may also be appointed at different ranks, as no member is permitted to have dual mess status (i.e. may only be permitted to eat/sleep in ONE of the Airmens' Mess, Sergeants' Mess or Officers' Mess).
AAFC staff members who join the ADF may have their rank changed to fit these criteria. This may include reversion in rank (e.g. PLTOFF or FSGT to CPL) or "promotion" (e.g. LAC or SGT to PLTOFF). The promotion to a commissioned officer rank is not automatic - the member is terminated as an instructor, and their application for an officer appointment is assessed. AAFC staff in the ADF do not need to have exactly the same rank in both the ADF and AAFC; their ranks are just required to adhere to the above criteria.
Promotion is less frequent than that of cadets, as there is no age limit on staff. The minimum time in rank requirements between promotions is three years, with the exception of promotion from AC/ACW(AAFC) to LAC/LACW(AAFC), LAC/LACW(AAFC) to CPL(AAFC) or from PLTOFF(AAFC) to FLGOFF(AAFC) in addition to other staff training requirements. The minimum time in rank requirement for AC/ACW(AAFC) to LAC/LACW(AAFC) is one year; from LAC/LACW(AAFC) to CPL(AAFC) is two years; and from PLTOFF(AAFC) to FLGOFF(AAFC) is two years.

The 1924 Kohat riots were major anti-Hindu riots that occurred in Kohat in North-West Frontier Province, British India in 1924. In three days (9–11 September) of riots, over 155 Hindus and Sikhs were killed. The entire population of Hindus and Sikhs living there had to flee for their lives. Gandhi undertook a 21 day fast for Hindu-Muslim unity in October 1924.
The riots were caused in response to the publication of a scurrilous book on Mohammed (pubh) named 'Ranglila Rasool'.

Cory Schneider

Cory Franklin Schneider (born March 18, 1986) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the New Jersey Devils in the National Hockey League (NHL).
Schneider was selected in the first round, 26th overall, by the Canucks in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Following his draft, he began a three-year tenure with the Boston College Eagles, winning two Lamoriello Trophies as Hockey East champions and making two NCAA Final appearances during his college career. Schneider turned professional with Vancouver's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, in 2007 and was named the league's Goaltender of the Year following his second season. After three seasons with the Moose, he became the Canucks' full-time backup in 2010–11. In his first full season with the Canucks, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy with Roberto Luongo for establishing the best team goals against average (GAA) in the NHL. The following campaign, he set Canucks records for best GAA and save percentage in a single season with 1.96 and .937 marks, respectively. At the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Schneider was traded to the New Jersey Devils for the 9th overall selection.
Internationally, Schneider has represented the United States at various junior levels. Early in his career, he won gold and silver medals at the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup and 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships, respectively. He later competed in the 2005 and 2006 World Junior Championships, finishing in fourth with the United States each time. Due to his Swiss ancestry, Schneider also holds a Swiss citizenship.
Early life.
Schneider was born to Susan and Richard Schneider in Marblehead, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. Schneider started training with his goalie coach, Brian Daccord, at age 15, who now owns Stop It Goaltending, a company of which currently Schneider owns a small percentage. He began playing hockey around the age of six, trying out for the same team as his older brother, Geoff. He did not become a regular goaltender until the age of 11, as the Marblehead Youth Hockey teams he played with at earlier ages rotated the position. Growing up, Schneider looked up to Mike Richter of the New York Rangers for being a successful American goaltender. Paying homage to Richter, he chose to wear the jersey number 35.
Schneider earned his secondary education at Marblehead High School in his hometown and Phillips Academy, a prep school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he graduated. In addition to hockey, he was also a varsity baseball player for two years during his time at Phillips Academy. While excelling in sports, Schneider also maintained proficiency in academics. Following his senior year, he received the school's Yale Bowl and the Boston Bruins' John Carlton Memorial Trophy, both for achievement in scholarship and athletics. While enrolled at Boston College, Schneider majored in finance in the institution's Carroll School of Management. He continued to be recognized for academic achievement, being named to two Hockey East All-Academic Teams and earning Paul Patrick Daley Student-Athlete Scholarship in 2006.
He is a member of his hometown Friends of Marblehead Hockey Hall of Fame. Inducted on August 18, 2008, he is the only born-and-raised native to be drafted into the NHL.
Playing career.
High school and USNTDP (2000–04).
Schneider played with Marblehead High School in his freshman year before moving to Phillips Academy because of their more prestigious hockey team. In his senior year with the school, he was named the team captain. He posted 17 wins and 4 losses with a .960 save percentage, while leading Phillips Academy to the New England Prep School semifinals. Schneider was a two-time All-New England selection in his high school career with Phillips Academy. During his senior year, Schneider also joined the United States National Team Development Program. He appeared in 10 games with the under-18 club and two games in North American Hockey League play.
Going into the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, Schneider was the second-ranked American goaltender behind Al Montoya and seventh North American goaltender overall by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He was selected in the first round, 26th overall, by the Vancouver Canucks.
Boston College (2004–07).
With the option of joining the major junior ranks in Canada or staying in the United States to play college hockey, Schneider prioritized getting an education and committed to the Boston College Eagles. He had also considered Harvard and Cornell. Boston College head coach Jerry York had considered delaying Schneider's debut for another season and have him play Junior A in the United States Hockey League. However, when forward Adam Pineault left Boston College to play in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, a scholarship was made available and York decided to keep Schneider on the roster.
Schneider made 23 saves in his college debut, a 3–2 win against the University of Massachusetts Lowell River Hawks. He was then chosen as the Hockey East Defensive Player of the Week on October 19, 2004. He later notched his first college shutout against the Yale Bulldogs on January 11, 2005. The following month, he was sidelined for three weeks after tearing the medial collateral ligament of his left knee during a game against the Harvard Crimson on February 14, 2005. Splitting the goaltending duties with senior Matti Kaltiainen, he appeared in 18 games with a 1.90 goals against average (GAA) and a .916 save percentage while finishing with a record of 13 wins, 1 loss and 4 ties. He was named to the Hockey East All-Rookie Team and received Boston College's Bernie Burke Outstanding Freshman Award.
By the playoffs, York made Schneider his starting goaltender over Kaltiainen. He went on to backstop Boston College to a record-setting sixth Lamoriello Trophy in team history as Hockey East champions. He made 39 saves in a double-overtime semifinal win against the Maine Black Bears, before a 26-save performance in Boston's 3–1 final win against the New Hampshire Wildcats. He gained Hockey East Rookie of the Week accolades on March 21, 2005, for his semifinal and final wins and was named to the All-Tournament Team for his efforts. Advancing to the 2005 NCAA Tournament, Boston College lost their regional final by a 6–3 score to the North Dakota Fighting Sioux.
In Schneider's sophomore season, he posted a college career-high .929 save percentage and two team records of eight shutouts and 1,088 saves. He posted 242:19 consecutive shutout minutes in the month of January, not allowing a goal for more than 11 periods. His streak was broken on January 27, 2006, in a game against Boston University. His 1.96 GAA was first among goaltenders in conference play, earning him the Hockey East Goaltending Award (his overall GAA including inter-conference play was 2.11). He was named to the Hockey East Second All-Conference Team and was a co-recipient with teammate Chris Collins for both the Hockey East Three Stars Award and Boston College MVP. At the 2006 Beanpot, he received the Eberly Trophy as the tournament's best goaltender with a .924 save percentage. His 24 wins in 39 regular season appearances helped Boston College to a successful regular season. In the playoffs, they failed to defend their Hockey East championship, losing to the Boston University Terriers in the final. Qualifying for the 2006 NCAA Tournament, Boston College met Boston University again in the regional final. Shutting the Terriers out to advance to the Frozen Four, Schneider was named the Northeastern Regional Tournament MVP. Boston College then defeated North Dakota in the semifinal before losing the national championship to the Wisconsin Badgers 2–1.
In his third season with Boston College, Schneider recorded a college career-high 29 wins in 42 games, along with a 2.15 GAA and .925 save percentage. He led the Eagles to their second Lamoirello Trophy in three years, defeating New Hampshire by a 5–2 score in the final. He made his second consecutive appearance in the NCAA final, but lost to the Michigan State Spartans. Following his third college season, Schneider chose to forgo his senior year to turn professional. He left Boston College with a career record of 65 wins, 25 losses and 7 ties in 97 games, as well as a college career mark of 15 shutouts.
Manitoba Moose (2007–10).
Schneider signed an entry-level contract with the Vancouver Canucks on July 3, 2007. He was regarded as the Canucks' third-string goalie behind Roberto Luongo and the newly acquired backup Curtis Sanford. Following his first NHL training camp, he was assigned to the Canucks' minor league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL). After a shaky start to the 2007–08 season (3-7-0 record, 3.69 GAA and .872 save percentage in 11 games), he was privately called out by head coach Scott Arniel in mid-December after being pulled the previous game. In recalling the meeting, Schneider has commented that " was one of the first guys to...tell me I wasn't good enough, something that I hadn't really heard a lot growing up. Sometimes it's something you need to hear." From that point on, he emerged as Manitoba's starting goalie over fellow Canucks prospect Drew MacIntyre, and was named the AHL Rookie of the Month for March. He finished the season with a 21-12-2 record, 2.28 GAA and .916 save percentage. Although the Moose were eliminated in the first round by the Syracuse Crunch, Schneider had an impressive playoffs, recording a 1.92 GAA and .938 save percentage over six games.
Going into training camp for the 2008–09 season, Schneider was expected to compete for the Canucks' backup position with Sanford, who had been re-signed in the off-season. He was assigned to the Moose for a second consecutive season where he continued as the minor league team's starting goalie. He received his first NHL call-up from Manitoba on November 22, 2008, following an injury to Luongo. At the time of his call-up, he was leading the AHL in both wins and GAA in addition to establishing a team record with 10 straight wins. After sitting on the bench as Sanford's backup for two games, Schneider made his first NHL appearance and start on November 29 against the Calgary Flames, making 28 saves in a 3–1 loss. He subsequently recorded his first NHL win in a 16-save, 2–1 victory against the Minnesota Wild on December 5. After appearing in eight games for the Canucks, goaltender Jason LaBarbera was acquired in a trade from the Los Angeles Kings and Schneider was sent back to the Moose on January 5, 2009.
During his time in Vancouver, Schneider had been named AHL Goalie of the Month for November. Upon returning to Manitoba, he extended his record-setting win streak to 13 games. He was also chosen as the starting goalie for PlanetUSA for the 2009 AHL All-Star Classic. He was named Top Goaltender in the Skills Competition, then helped PlanetUSA to a 15–11 win over the Canadian All-Stars. Near the end of the season, he was chosen as AHL Player of the Week on March 30, 2009, after allowing five goals in three starts. He completed the campaign with team records of 28 wins, 2.04 GAA and .928 save percentage. Additionally the league-leader in GAA and save percentage, Schneider was awarded the Aldege "Baz" Bastien Memorial Award as AHL goaltender of the year. He also received the Harry "Hap" Holmes Memorial Award as the goaltender on the team with the lowest goals against. His award-winning campaign helped the Moose to the best regular season record in the league. In the proceeding 2009 playoffs, Schneider backstopped the Moose to the Calder Cup Finals, losing the championship in six games to the Hershey Bears. He finished the playoffs with a 2.15 GAA and .922 save percentage in 22 games.
In September 2009, Vancouver re-signed Luongo to a 12-year extension. As such, it was widely speculated that Schneider would inevitably be traded. Despite his success in the AHL, his chances of competing for a starting position with the Canucks were seen as unlikely by the media due to Luongo's prominence on the team. Regardless, he publicly maintained he was unfazed by his position on the Canucks' depth chart and that he was focused on competing with the newly acquired Andrew Raycroft for the Canucks' backup position in 2009–10. Schneider was, however, sent back to the Moose out of training camp.
Less than a month into the season, Schneider received his second NHL call-up with the Canucks to back up Raycroft after Luongo was sidelined with a rib fracture on October 28, 2009. He remained with the Canucks for nearly two weeks, earning one start against the Dallas Stars on November 6, stopping 45 shots in a 2–1 loss. He was returned to the Moose on November 10.
Despite being the reigning goaltender of the year in the AHL and having a comparable season in 2009–10, Schneider was not named to PlanetUSA for the 2010 AHL All-Star Game. The non-selection drew public criticism from Moose head coach Arniel. Amidst a mediocre season as a team, Schneider posted a 2.51 GAA and .919 save percentage and topped his previous team record of wins in a season with 35 in 60 games. During the campaign, he also surpassed Alex Auld on the franchise's all-time wins and games played list, finishing with 84 and 136, respectively. Manitoba qualified for the 2010 playoffs with the final and eighth seed in the Western Conference. Matching up against the Hamilton Bulldogs in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Schneider recorded a 3.12 GAA and .905 save percentage in the losing effort.
Vancouver Canucks (2010–13).
On June 2, 2010, Schneider signed a two-year, $1.8 million contract extension with the Vancouver Canucks. Assistant general manager Lawrence Gilman asserted that the new deal should establish him as Luongo's backup and garner more exposure to potentially facilitate a trade to another NHL team. He made his first start of the 2010–11 season on October 18, 2010, against the Carolina Hurricanes. He stopped 32 shots in a 5–1 win, marking his first NHL victory since December 14, 2008. Later in the season, he recorded his first NHL shutout, stopping 26 shots in a 3–0 win against the Anaheim Ducks on March 6, 2011. Nearing the end of the regular season, the Canucks were leading the league in team GAA, putting Luongo and Schneider in contention for the William M. Jennings Trophy. However, with a week remaining in the regular season, Schneider was two appearances short of the 25-game minimum to qualify for the Jennings (had he not reached the requirement, Luongo would have been awarded the trophy by himself). While head coach Alain Vigneault initially dismissed the notion of playing Schneider for the sole purpose of sharing the award with Luongo, he sent Schneider in relief of Luongo with 28 seconds remaining in the third-last game of the season, a 2–0 loss to the Edmonton Oilers for Schneider's 24th appearance. Two games later – the Canucks' last contest of the regular season – Schneider was given the start against the Calgary Flames. Needing to allow seven goals or fewer to secure the Jennings, he helped Vancouver to a 3–2 overtime win. It marked the first time in the trophy's history that it was awarded to Canucks goaltenders. Luongo and Schneider's combined GAA of 2.20 was 0.10 better than the Boston Bruins's second-place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask. Schneider completed his NHL rookie season with a 2.23 GAA and .929 save percentage in 25 games (22 starts), as well as a 16-4-2 record. His GAA tied for fourth in the league, while his save percentage ranked third and set a single-season Canucks record.
Schneider made his NHL playoff debut in Game 4 of the opening round against the Chicago Blackhawks. With the Canucks down 6–1, Luongo was pulled in favour of Schneider in the third period. Schneider allowed one goal on seven shots, as the Blackhawks went on to win the game 7–2. After Luongo was pulled again in Game 5, Schneider was chosen to start for Game 6. Schneider allowed three goals on 20 shots; he left the game in the third period after suffering cramps during a failed attempt to stop a penalty shot from Michael Frolik. The Canucks went on to lose the contest 4–3 in overtime, but won the following Game 7 with Luongo in net to advance to the second round. The Canucks would advance to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins. Schneider made an appearance in Game 6, replacing Luongo in the first period after he gave up three goals. Schneider allowed two goals in relief for the remainder of the game as the Canucks went on to lose the contest. With Schneider on the bench, Vancouver then lost Game 7 at home.
Remaining as Luongo's backup for the start of the 2011–12 season, Schneider's playing time was expanded when Luongo suffered an injury in mid-November 2011. Despite Luongo's return to the lineup after missing two games, Schneider continued to earn starts due to his performance. On November 28, he was named the NHL's Second Star of the Week after recording three wins in as many contests, a span that included back-to-back shutouts (on November 23 against the Colorado Avalanche and November 25 against the Phoenix Coyotes). Schneider finished his second full NHL season with improved numbers. Of the 33 games he played, he started 28 and compiled 20 wins and 9 losses. His 1.96 GAA and .937 save percentage over 33 games ranked third and second in the league, respectively, while also setting Canucks team records. His GAA topped the 2.11 mark Luongo had set in 2010–11, while his save percentage bettered the .929 he had achieved, also in the previous season. The latter team record also ranked as the fourth-best ever recorded in the NHL.
During the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Schneider supplanted Luongo as the team's playoff goalie. After Vancouver lost their first two games against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in the opening round, Vigneault started Schneider. Despite losing game three, Schneider started for the remainder of the series, which Los Angeles won four-games-to-one. In three games, he recorded a 1.31 GAA and .960 save percentage. Vigneault's decision led many in the media to believe that Schneider would retain the role the following season, while Luongo would be traded. Although Luongo's contract included a no-trade clause, he told reporters following the Canucks' defeat to the Kings that he would waive it if the team asked him to. During the off season, Schneider and the Canucks agreed to a three-year contract worth $12 million.
During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Schneider played with Swiss team HC Ambrì-Piotta of National League A. He played in eight games and recorded a .914 save percentage. Returning to Vancouver as NHL play resumed, Schneider appeared in 30 games for the Canucks and posted a 17–9–4 record and was one of five goaltenders to tie for the league lead with five shutouts. He appeared in two playoff games, both losses, as the Canucks were swept out of the first round by the San Jose Sharks.
New Jersey Devils (2013–present).
The Canucks spent a full year attempting to trade Luongo and his contract before conceding that no team was willing to meet their demands. Instead they agreed to trade Schneider to the New Jersey Devils. The deal, completed on June 30 at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, saw the ninth overall selection (Bo Horvat) sent to Vancouver. Schneider described the trade as "shocking", adding that after several seasons of expecting to be traded, he had finally begun to believe he would stay in Vancouver. He played his first game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, a 3-0 loss.
International play.
Schneider competed for the United States at the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup, held in Břeclav, Czech Republic and Piešťany, Slovakia. He helped the club go undefeated in five games, en route to the country's first gold medal in the history of the tournament. Sharing goaltending duties with Ian Keserich over the course of the tournament, Schneider was given the start for the gold medal game against Russia, turning aside 32 shots for the 3–2 win.
Schneider next appeared for the United States at the 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships in Minsk, Belarus. He recorded the third-best GAA (1.71) and second-best save percentage (.929) of the tournament en route to a silver medal. The United States were defeated in the gold medal game by Russia 3–2. He was later named the David Peterson Goalie of the Year by USA Hockey, having led them to two medals in the 2003–04 season.
In August 2004, Schneider participated in the U.S. National Junior Team Evaluation Camp in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Several months later, he debuted at the under-20 level at the 2005 World Junior Championships, hosted by the United States in Grand Forks and Thief River Falls, Minnesota. Playing backup to Al Montoya, he was given the start for a preliminary game against Belarus. After just over a period of play, he was pulled for allowing three goals on eight shots. The United States lost the game 5–3 in Schneider's only tournament appearance. After losing to Russia 7–2 in the semifinal, the United States lost the bronze medal game 3–2 to the Czech Republic in overtime.
After attending the U.S.'s summer evaluation camp for a second straight year in Lake Placid, New York, Schneider was given the starting position for the 2006 World Junior Championships in British Columbia, Canada. He was named the United States' player of the game in their third match of the preliminary round, a 2–2 tie against Switzerland; Schneider made 22 saves. He earned his second player of the game selection in the quarterfinal, stopping 30 shots in a 2–1 win against the Czech Republic. The United States were then eliminated in the semifinal by Russia before losing the bronze medal game to Finland. He appeared in six games total with a 2.67 GAA and .912 save percentage, fifth among tournament goaltenders.
Schneider's first experience with the men's senior team came in 2007 when he was among the first eighteen players named to the United States' team for the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Russia. Despite being named to the team, Schneider did not play in any games, instead serving as the team's third goaltender behind John Grahame and Jason Bacashihua.
Playing style.
Schneider plays in the butterfly style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning at the age of 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better prepared him for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.

Movements.
The calcaneocuboid joint is conventionally described as among the least mobile joints in the human foot. The articular surfaces of the two bones are relatively flat with some irregular undulations, which seem to suggest movement limited to a single rotation and some translation. However, the cuboid rotates as much as 25° about an oblique axis during inversion-eversion in a movement that could be called obvolution-involution.

Sebastiano Rossi

Sebastiano Rossi (born 20 July 1964) is a retired Italian footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
During a 21-year professional career, he appeared in 346 Serie A games, most notably representing A.C. Milan (12 seasons), with which he won 12 major titles, namely five national championships and the 1994 UEFA Champions League.
Football career.
Cesena.
Rossi was born in Cesena. Refusing the opportunity to play basketball, he joined his hometown club A.C. Cesena in 1979, at the age of fifteen. In 1982–83, on loan, he made his senior debuts, A.C. Forlì, a small club in the Serie C1, being backup in a relegation-ending season.
After two more loans, Rossi returned to Cesena for the 1986–87 season, only missing five games as the Emilia-Romagna club promoted to Serie A, and retaining first-choice status in the following three top division seasons, with the club finishing 12th in 1989–90; he made his debut in the competition on 13 September 1987, in a home match against S.S.C. Napoli.
Milan.
After his first season in Italy's top flight, Rossi was noticed by A.C. Milan, and joined the "Rossoneri" (also dubbed the "Dream Team") that dominated Italian football for much of the 1990s. In his first season he backedup Andrea Pazzagli, but the veteran left for Bologna F.C. 1909 in the ensuing summer.
Rossi then briefly battled for starting duties with Francesco Antonioli, before becoming Milan's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper, being part of a legendary defensive line that included, amongst others, Mauro Tassotti, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini. Ironically, this strong defence was one of the reasons why Rossi was rarely called-up by Italy: Arrigo Sacchi, who coached the national team during this time, evidently felt that it was the defence and not the goalkeeper that was responsible for the club's great success. Under the tutelage of Fabio Capello, the "Invincibles" went on a famous 58-match unbeaten run and won four "Scudetti" in five seasons. 
After the 1996 championship, Milan suddenly fell from the throne, finishing 11th in 1997 and 10th in 1998, as Rossi's own career also declined. During round 17 of the 1998-99 season, Milan were leading Perugia 2-0 at the 90' when a penalty was awarded to Perugia; after Hidetoshi Nakata converted the penalty, Cristian Bucchi was retrieving the ball in the back of the net when he was struck by Rossi. Rossi was red carded and given a 5 match ban. Consequentially, Christian Abbiati made is first appearance in Serie A at the 92' while Rossi lost the first-choice status. He did contribute with 13 appearances in another league conquest, in 1998–99.
Perugia / Retirement.
After the 2001–02 season, Rossi moved to Perugia Calcio, who were facing a goalkeeper crisis at the time. He contributed relatively as the club retained its top level status, then retired at the end of that sole campaign, at the age of 39.
Rossi made one final appearance for Milan at the San Siro, in a testimonial match for Demetrio Albertini, his teammate for eleven seasons. Subsequently, he worked as goalkeeper coach in the club's youth department.
Record.
Rossi is the record holder for the longest streak without conceding a goal in Serie A history. In an 11-match span from 12 December 1993 to 27 February 1994, he kept a clean sheet for 929 consecutive minutes, before being beaten by an excellent long-range strike by Foggia's Igor Kolyvanov at the San Siro. He beat the record set by Dino Zoff in the 1972–73 season by 26 minutes.

Cúc Phương National Park

Cúc Phương National Park () is located in Ninh Bình Province, in Vietnam's Red River Delta. Cuc Phuong was Vietnam's first national park and is the country's largest nature reserve. The park is one of the most important sites for biodiversity in Vietnam.
History.
In 1960 Cúc Phương was made into a forest reserve and in 1962 Cúc Phương National Park was consecrated by President Ho Chi Minh. Human habitation in Cúc Phương dates back long before the park’s creation, 7,000-12,000 years ago. Artifacts from that time have been found in numerous caves within the park, including human graves, stone axes, pointed bone spears, oyster shell knives, and tools for grinding. In 1789 the Quen Voi section of the park was the site of a major battle in the civil war between Nguyễn Huệ and Thăng Long. More recently, conflicts have emerged between the government and 2,500 Muong ethnic minority tribesmen who live, farm, and hunt in the park. In 1987, 500 Muong were relocated outside of the park because of issues over poaching and land use.
Landscape and climate.
Cúc Phương is situated in the foothills of the northern Annamite Range. The park consists of verdant karst mountains and lush valleys. Elevation varies from 150 meters (500 feet) to 656 m (2,152 feet) at the summit of May Bac Mountain, or Silver Cloud Mountain. The limestone mountains house numerous caves, many of which are accessible for exploration.
The average temperature in Cúc Phương is 21 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit), with a mean winter temperature of 9C (48F). High temperatures can reach above 30C (85 F) and lows are just above zero (32 F). At the low elevations in the valley the temperature is hot and humid while at higher elevations the temperature drops and frostbite is a threat. On average it rains more than 200 days a year and the average annual rainfall is 2,100mm (7 feet). The dry season is November to February, the driest months being December and January.
Flora and fauna.
Cúc Phương is home to an amazing diversity of flora and fauna. Inhabitants of the park include 97 species of mammals, most notable endangered langurs; 300 species of birds; 36 reptilian species; 17 species of amphibians; 11 species of fish; 2,000 species of vascular plants, and thousands of species of insects. A number of species in the park are listed on Vietnam Red Book of endangered species.
Primates in the park include macaques, gibbon, François's leaf monkey and slow loris.
Other mammals including bats, porcupine, flying squirrel, small striped squirrel, belly-banded squirrel, and the rare black giant squirrel. In the past the park was home to Asiatic black bears, wild dogs, and tiger, but over hunting and lack of prey have most led to the loss of these species. Leopard, clouded leopard and jungle cat may still be present in the park.
Bird species include Bar-backed Partridge, Scaly-breasted Partridge, Silver Pheasant, Red Junglefowl, Grey Peacock-Pheasant, Laughingthrushes, Red-vented Barbet, Green-eared Barbet, Scimitar-billed Babblers, Brown Hawk-Owl, Scarlet Minivet, Racket-tailed Drongos, Racket-tailed Treepie, White-winged Blue Magpie. Migrant species include thrushes, flycatchers, tits, finches, pipits amongst others. Hornbills can also be spotted in the forest.
An endemic subspecies of sub-terranic cave fish is also located in the park.
Flora in the park includes multi-layered canopy; trees up to 70m in height; flowers, including, orchids; ferns with amazingly tall leaves; and an abundance of liane and cauliflory. The park also contains plants used for such practicalities as spices and medicines as well as edible fruits, nuts and shoots.
Conservation programs.
There are three conservation programs located in the Cúc Phương National park:
Endangered Primate Rescue Center.
The primate center houses specimens of langurs, loris, and gibbon species, include the critically endangered Delacour's langur, Golden-headed Langur, Tonkin snub-nosed langur and black crested gibbon. The primate center was established in 1993 with the help of the Frankfurt Zoological Society and has grown to 100 animals in 30 cages, 4 houses, two semi-wild enclosures.
Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program.
The Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program (CPCP) is dedicated to the conservation of small carnivores (civets, linsangs, small cats, weasels, otters and badgers) and pangolins in Vietnam. The program was established in 1995 as a species specific program for the endangered Owston's civet and has since expanded to include all species of small carnivore. In 2006 the program also began focused conservation activities for Vietnam's two species of pangolin, the Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin. All of these species are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade which is having a devastating impact on the wild populations of these species throughout South East Asia.
The CPCP aims to conserve these threatened species of mammal through the rescue and rehabilitation of trade confiscated wildlife, education and awareness and field research. The CPCP also runs the region's only conservation breeding program for the Owston's civet, a species that is endemic to Indochina, and whose main range is within Vietnam.
The CPCP's main centre is within Cúc Phương National Park, but operates a nationwide rescue program and has active field sites in Central and Southern Vietnam.
Turtle Conservation Center.
The turtle conservation center was established in 1998 and is home to some of the most endangered turtles in Vietnam, including the Vietnamese pond turtle which is nearly extinct in the wild. 
Tourism.
Cúc Phương National Park is one of the most popular nature tourist destinations in Vietnam. Tens of thousands of Vietnamese and a steady stream of foreign tourists visit the park each year. Lodging and restaurant facilities are available at the park's entrance and within the park. A paved road cuts into the park and a number of paths for hiking are maintained. Park rangers patrol Cuc Phuong and provide guided tours for a fee.
Other nearby tourist destinations located in Ninh Binh Province include Phát Diệm Cathedral, Hoa Lư Ancient Capital, [http://www.tamcoctours.com[Tam Cốc-Bích Động], Tràng An, and .

Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship

Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International (PATH Intl.), formerly the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) is a non-profit organization based in Denver, Colorado that promotes the benefits of therapeutic horseback riding and other equine-assisted activities and therapies for people with physical, emotional and learning disabilities. 
PATH Intl. is a 501(c)(3) organization.
The PATH Intl. mission statement: “PATH Intl. changes and enriches lives by promoting excellence in equine-assisted activities and therapies.” 
The association was originally formed in 1969 as the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) to promote equine-assisted activities for individuals with disabilities. The name was changed to PATH Intl. in July 2011. With more than 800 member centers, a total of more than 43,000 children and adults find a sense of independence through involvement with horses. These member centers range from small, one-person programs to large operations with several riding instructors. In addition to horseback riding, a center may offer any number of equine-assisted activities such as driving, vaulting, trail riding, competition, hippotherapy, equine-facilitated psychotherapy, ground work, or stable management. Through a wide variety of educational resources, the association helps individuals start and maintain successful programs. There are more than 29,000 volunteers, 1,900 instructors, 5,800 program equines, and thousands of contributors from all over the world making a difference in people’s lives at PATH Intl. centers. 
Beginning in 1969 PATH Intl. has ensured that therapeutic riding is both safe for, and accessible to, those in need. Since that time the field of therapeutic riding has expanded along with the numbers of individuals profiting from involvement with horses. Today PATH Intl. represents a growing number of equine-assisted activities, including recreational riding for individuals with disabilities, driving, vaulting, competition and other recreational and educational interactions with horses. 
PATH Intl. provides opportunities for people with varying ability levels to challenge themselves physically and emotionally and to set goals to improve their quality of life via the horse. Training professionals to support and facilitate this process, educating the public about the positive impact of the human/animal bond and setting national standards for safe and effective equine assisted activities are part of PATH Intl.'s long-range goals.
PATH Intl. benefits.
Center accreditation.
Center accreditation programs ensure high quality and safe provision of equine assisted activities offered by PATH centers across the U.S. and Canada. Just as other professions use accreditation and licensing systems to improve the well-being of their industries, professionals in the field of equine assisted activities have a distinction of their own through the Premier Accredited Center Program. The Premier Accredited Center (PAC) Program, give centers the chance to demonstrate their excellence in providing quality equine assisted activities. 
This voluntary process recognizes PATH Intl. centers that have met established industry standards. The accreditation process is a peer review system in which trained volunteer site visitors inspect and review centers in accordance with PATH standards. A center that meets the accreditation requirements based on the administrative, facility, program and applicable special interest standards becomes a Premier Accredited Center (PAC) for a period of five years.
Instructor certification/education.
PATH Intl. provides certification for riding, driving and vaulting instructors as well as for equine specialists in mental health and learning. Registered, Advanced and Master level certification are available for riding instructors. Instructors who teach at PATH Intl. Centers are required to achieve PATH Intl. Instructor Certification status. Instructors may apply for any level of certification that they feel they are qualified to achieve, as long as the application criteria for that level are met. The criteria at each level details the skills and knowledge an instructor of that level must have regarding Equine Management, Horsemanship, Instruction, Teaching Methodology and Disabilities. All evaluations of instructor applications, at all three levels, regardless of certification method, are based on these criteria. 
PATH Intl. also supports regional conferences for continuing education and hosts a national conference each year. In 2012, the national conference will be held in Seattle, WA.
"PATH Intl. Strides".
All members of PATH Intl. receive "PATH Intl. Strides" four times a year. This engaging magazine is an accurate industry journal that focuses on the work of PATH Intl.. Rider profiles, how-to articles, editorials and instructional columns seek to educate a general readership of the diverse aspects of equine assisted activities. Each seasonal issue carries a theme.

Bob Kamps

Bob Kamps (1931–2005) was an American rock climber whose climbing career spanned five decades. Born in Wisconsin, he began climbing in California in 1955, and was a member of that cadre of Yosemite pioneers who first ascended many of its great walls in the 1950s and 1960s. He was particularly adept on steep rock faces, and was among the first to shift attention from aid climbing to free climbing. Over the years he made more than 3,100 climbs. Many were first ascents or first free ascents.
Kamps' interests ranged from ten-foot boulders to high mountain walls. He bouldered at Stoney Point at Chatsworth, California, for fifty years. His companions in the 1950s and 1960s included Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, Mark Powell, and Dave Rearick. After his death in 2005, a memorial service was held there. Kamps bouldered almost everywhere he climbed for any length of time, and John Gill joined him on numerous occasions in the Tetons and Black Hills. 
Kamps climbed extensively in California, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota. His climbing partners included Mark Powell, Dave Rearick, Tom Higgins, and Yvon Chouinard. In the Tetons in 1958, Kamps teamed with Chouinard to make the first ascent of the imposing "Satisfaction Buttress"; but the two were turned back the following year on an attempt on the forbidding north face of the Crooked Thumb on Teewinot Mountain, when Chouinard's aid pitons pulled out of the decomposing rock and he took a fall through open space, held on belay by Kamps. (The climb was completed seven years later by Pete Cleveland). 
In the summer of 1960, Kamps and Dave Rearick received permission from the National Park Service to attempt to scale the famous Diamond on Longs Peak near Estes Park, Colorado. There were existing routes to the side of the massive, slightly overhanging wall, but none up the center. Their successful ascent took over two days, and involved both aid climbing and free climbing. After descending the two climbers were given a parade through Estes Park, and the feat was reported in newspapers throughout the US and in Time Magazine. 
Kamps and Powell made the first free ascent of a route called "Chingadera" on Tahquitz Rock in California in 1967. Kamps's placement of a critical protective bolt while on lead, using a manual twist drill, earned him the admiration of later generations of climbers, who have found even clipping onto the bolt is difficult. The climb was an early 5.11. That same year, Kamps and Higgins - both highly proficient on slabs and faces with tiny holds - climbed "Lucky Streaks" on Fairview Dome in Tuolumne Meadows, (Hard 5.10).
The granite Needles of the Black Hills of South Dakota – slim spires ranging from twenty to well over a hundred feet in height – were a favorite summer playground for Kamps. Steep and adorned with crystalline nubbins, frequently the rock requires the sort of face-climbing of which Kamps was a master. His many first ascents include "Sore Thumb" (5.9 - 1965) and "Freak's Fright" (5.10 – 1967). 
A traditional climber for most of his career, he turned to sport climbing in his 60s, and led 5.10 and 5.11 climbs well into his 70s. He was noted for his intelligence, charm, and sly wit. Kamps died in March 2005 of a massive heart attack while on the wall of a climbing gym. He is survived by his wife, Bonnie – his biggest supporter.

Crossing (architecture)

A crossing, in ecclesiastical architecture, is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform (cross-shaped) church.
In a typically oriented church (especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles), the crossing gives access to the nave on the west, the transept arms on the north and south, and the choir on the east.
The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome. A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals. With the Renaissance, building a dome above the crossing became popular. Because the crossing is open on four sides, the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders. In centuries past, it was not uncommon for overly ambitious crossing towers to collapse. Sacrist Alan of Walsingham's octagon, built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely's nave crossing on 22 February 1322, is the "... greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral" according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner.
A tower may be called a "lantern tower" if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing.
In Early Medieval churches, the crossing square was often used as a module, or a unit of measurement. The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square. This was to ensure that the church was properly proportioned.

Tembusu

The Tembusu ("Fagraea fragrans") is a large evergreen tree in the family Gentianaceae. It is native to South-east Asia. Its trunk is dark brown, with deeply fissured bark, looking somewhat like a bittergourd. It grows in an irregular shape from 10 to 25m high. Its leaves are light green and oval in shape. Its yellowish flowers have a distinct fragrance and the fruits of the tree are bitter tasting red berries, which are eaten by birds and fruit bats.
Common names.
Buabua (Fiji Islands), Urung (Philippines), Temasuk (Sabah), Tatrao, Trai (Viet Nam), Kan Krao (Thailand), Tembesu (Indonesia), Anan, Ananma (Burma)., Munpla (Thailand, lao)
Uses.
The trunk of this tree can produce very hard wood that can be used to make chopping boards.
The wood can last over 100 years, particularly as termites and weevils do not eat this kind of wood. People always use this wood for creating the floors of their homes and love to sleep on it.

Area code 606

Area code 606 is a telephone area code serving the easternmost part of the state of Kentucky. It covers Ashland, Hazard, Manchester, Somerset, London, Corbin, Paintsville, Pikeville, Maysville and other parts of eastern Kentucky. Most of its service area lies within the Kentucky region known as the Eastern Mountain Coal Fields.
It was created in 1954 as a split from area code 502, and originally covered the eastern half of Kentucky, from the Lexington area to the West Virginia border. Notably, it was one of the first three area codes with "0" as the middle digit that wasn't assigned to an entire state; the others were area code 507 in Minnesota and area code 607 in New York. 
In 1999, most of the northwestern portion of the old 606 territory, including Lexington and Northern Kentucky, split off as area code 859. Conventional wisdom suggested that Lexington and Northern Kentucky should have kept 606. Lexington was by far the largest city in the old area code, and together with Northern Kentucky accounted for almost two-thirds of its population. However, the rural portion of 606 is one of the poorest areas of the nation; 16 of the poorest counties in the nation by median income are in 606. The Kentucky Public Service Commission and BellSouth (now part of AT&T), the dominant carrier in the area at the time, decided to let the rural portion retain 606 in order to spare residents and businesses in this notoriously impoverished area the expense and burden of having to change their numbers. 
The 859 split left 606 as one of the most thinly populated area codes in the country. It is not currently projected to exhaust until 2029.

Derek Oldham

Derek Oldham (29 March 1887 – 20 March 1968) was an English singer and actor, best known for his performances in the tenor roles of the Savoy Operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
After performing in concerts as a boy soprano and working as a bank clerk, Oldham began a professional performing career in 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, he joined the Scots Guards, serving with valour. After the war, he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, singing the tenor leads in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas for three years. He then starred in musicals and operettas in the West End in the 1920s, including "Madame Pompadour", "The Merry Widow", "Rose-Marie" and "The Vagabond King". He returned to the D'Oyly Carte for brief periods from 1929 to 1937. 
Oldham continued singing, recording and acting through the 1940s, also appearing in several films. He concentrated on legitimate theatre in the 1950s, acting until the age of 70. He maintained a lifelong interest in Gilbert and Sullivan, serving as an officer of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society. He finally retired to Hampshire during the last ten years of his life.
Life and career.
Oldham was born John Stephens Oldham in Accrington, Lancashire, the son of Thomas Oldham and his wife Harriett, "née" Stephens. He had an elder brother, George, and a sister. As a child, Oldham was a boy soprano in demand for over five years in oratorios (including Sullivan's "The Golden Legend" and "The Prodigal Son"), concerts (including "Neath My Lattice" from Sullivan's "The Rose of Persia"), and pantomimes. As a young man, he worked as a bank clerk and sang in amateur operatic societies.
He debuted on the professional adult stage in 1914, as Julien in "The Daring of Diane", an operetta by Alfred Anderson and Heinrich Reinhardt, presented at the London Pavilion. He made an immediate mark: "The Observer" said that he "has an exceptionally charming tenor voice, uses it with fine art, and acts with engaging simplicity and sincerity." Later that year, at the Lyric Theatre, he played Bumerli in "The Chocolate Soldier", in which he also won excellent notices. At the end of that year, after the outbreak of World War I, he joined the Scots Guards, a year later was commissioned in the East Lancashire Regiment and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry in Macedonia in 1918. During the war, he formed a concert group to entertain his fellow servicemen, also producing "The Chocolate Soldier" not far from enemy lines.
D'Oyly Carte and musical comedy years.
Oldham was demobilised in July 1919 and joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company the following month, when the company opened its first London season in over a decade. He immediately assumed the leading Gilbert and Sullivan tenor roles of Alexis in "The Sorcerer", Lord Tolloller in "Iolanthe", Cyril in "Princess Ida", Nanki-Poo in "The Mikado", Colonel Fairfax in "The Yeomen of the Guard", and Marco in "The Gondoliers". The following year, he also took on the roles of Ralph Rackstraw in "H.M.S. Pinafore", Frederic in "The Pirates of Penzance", and Richard Dauntless in "Ruddigore". In 1921 he exchanged Cyril for Prince Hilarion in "Princess Ida".
Oldham left the D'Oyly Carte company in 1922 to star in a great number of musicals and operettas during the 1920s at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and other West End theatres. His first musical was "Whirled into Happiness" at the Lyric Theatre, as Horace Wiggs, where his leading lady was his future wife, Winnie Melville. They married in 1923. She later joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a principal soprano. Oldham wrote, "The sheltered, almost student life of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company gave place to the hard glitter and luxury of the West End theatre – a world of restaurants, supper parties, and all the trappings that went with London theatrical life between the two wars". Other musicals in which Oldham starred included "Madame Pompadour" (1923, as Rene), "The Merry Widow" (1923, as Camille), and "Rose-Marie" (1925, as Jim). In 1927, Oldham and Melville starred together in the European première of "The Vagabond King", he as François Villon, and she as Katherine de Vaucelles. They separated in 1933 and later divorced, and she died in 1937.
Oldham returned several times to D'Oyly Carte, appearing in the 1929–30 season and on tour in his old roles of Ralph, Frederic, Tolloller, Hilarion, Nanki-Poo, Fairfax, and Marco. In the 1934–35 season, he played these roles on the company's first major American tour in the 20th century. In 1936, during the company's season at Sadler's Wells, he played Hilarion, and he was leading tenor in the 1936–37 season, which included another long American tour. Oldham's presence was a condition demanded by the American promoters. During this tour he and Sylvia Cecil were seconded by the company for one night to sing "Prithee, pretty maiden", from "Patience" at President Roosevelt's inauguration party at the White House.
Later years.
Oldham later played in many musicals and plays, including "The Song of the Drum" at Drury Lane, as Captain Anthony Darrell (1931). He appeared at the Royal Albert Hall as Chibiabos in "Hiawatha" in 1938, conducted by Malcolm Sargent. After 1948 he developed a career as a Lieder singer and lecture-recitalist and later as a character actor in non-musical plays. His last role in London was Dr. Stoner in the Agatha Christie play "Verdict" (1958). Between 1934 and 1957, he also appeared in several films.
In 1940, on 29 February, the character Frederic came of age, as described in "The Pirates of Penzance", Act II. This was a significant date for any G&S tenor. In New York, the Gilbert and Sullivan Society journal, "The Palace Peeper", marked the event by publishing an original ode to Frederic, in which Oldham was honoured as the archetype of the romantic Frederic. A member of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society in London from 1924, Oldham was elected Vice-President of the Society in 1947. 
During his last decade, Oldham lived in retirement in Hayling Island, Hampshire, but he often visited London. He acted as compère for the D'Oyly Carte company's last night revelries at the close of its 1961–62 London season at the Savoy Theatre. He died in Portsmouth in 1968, just before his 81st birthday.
Recordings and films.
Oldham played leading tenor roles in nineteen full and abridged HMV Savoy opera recordings, as follows: Defendant in "Trial by Jury" (1928), Alexis in "The Sorcerer" (1933), Frederic in "Pirates" (1920, 1929 and 1931), the Duke of Dunstable in "Patience" (1930), Earl Tolloller in "Iolanthe" (1922 and 1929), Hilarion in "Princess Ida" (1924 and 1932), Nanki-Poo in "The Mikado" (1926 and 1936), Richard Dauntless in "Ruddigore" (1924 and 1931), Colonel Fairfax in "Yeomen" (1920, 1928 and 1931) and Marco in "The Gondoliers" (1927 and 1931). He also made numerous recordings of songs, musicals and operettas.
He also appeared in several films between 1934 and 1957, including "The Broken Rosary" (1934), as Giovanni; "Charing Cross Road" (1935), as Jimmy O'Connell; "Melody of My Heart" (1936), as Joe Montfort, and "Dangerous Exile" (1957), as William.

Tuxtla Statuette

The Tuxtla Statuette is a small 6.3 inch (16 cm) rounded greenstone figurine, carved to resemble a squat, bullet-shaped human with a duck-like bill and wings. Most researchers believe the statuette represents a shaman wearing a bird mask and bird cloak. It is incised with 75 glyphs of the Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script, one of the few extant examples of this very early Mesoamerican writing system.
The human face carved into the stone is unremarkable except for the long bill that extends down his chest. This bill has been identified as belonging to the boat-billed heron, a locally abundant bird along the Tabasco and southern Veracruz Gulf Coast. Raised wings or a wing-like cape envelop the body while feet have been incised into the base. 
The Tuxtla Statuette is particularly notable in that its glyphs include the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar date of March 162 CE, which in 1902 was the oldest Long Count date discovered. A product of the final century of the Epi-Olmec culture, the statuette is from the same region and period as La Mojarra Stela 1 and may refer to the same events or persons. Similarities between the Tuxtla Statuette and Cerro de las Mesas Monument 5, a boulder carved to represent a semi-nude figure with a duckbill-like buccal mask, have also been noted.
The Tuxtla Statuette was discovered in 1902 by a farmer plowing his field in the west foothills of the Tuxtlas mountains in the Mexican state of Veracruz. It was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution shortly thereafter, reputedly smuggled into New York hidden in a shipment of tobacco leaf. At the time, several Mayanists including Sylvanus Morley, could not believe that the statuette pre-dated the Maya and suggested that the date and text were inscribed much later than 162 CE. However, later discoveries, such as La Mojarra Stela 1 and Tres Zapotes Stela C, confirmed the antiquity of the statuette. 
The Tuxtla Statuette is in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (Catalogue No. A222579-0). It is on loan for exhibit in "50 Years of Pre-Columbian Art", January 15, 2013 - January 5, 2014 at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C..

NZR DF class (1954)

The New Zealand DF class locomotive of 1954 was the first class of mainline diesel-electric locomotives built for New Zealand's national railway network, built by English Electric. It should not be confused with General Motors Electro-Motive Division DF class of 1979.
Introduction.
They had a wheel arrangement of (2'Co)(Co'2) under the UIC classification system, generated 1120 kW (1500 hp) of power, and could achieve a maximum speed of 97 km/h. They started the process of displacing steam motive power from main lines in New Zealand, but were soon displaced themselves by the DA class of 1955.
Initially, 31 DF locomotives were ordered, but this order was amended to ten DFs and 42 DG class locomotives, which in appearance was essentially half a DF but with a similar Bulldog nose cab design. The DF locomotives were lighter than the later and more powerful DAs and were used to haul freight trains on the North Auckland and East Coast Main Trunk lines in Northland and the Bay of Plenty from which the DAs were prohibited by dint of the higher axle loading of the DA class. The DF class were confined to the North Island, although they did all visit Dunedin for overhaul at Hillside Workshops. The locomotives did not run in service during their journeys to and from Hillside, instead being towed. They were allowed to move under their own power once there and haul transfer freight trains to and from Port Chalmers and Mosgiel as part of tests before returning to service. 
On the arrival of the Phase III DA's in 1964, the DF class was renumbered from the 1500 series to the 1300 series in order to free up the 1500-series numbers for the new DA's.
Withdrawal.
The DFs were plagued by unreliability and often had to undergo repairs. This contributed to their short lifespan; withdrawal began in 1972 and the last, DF 1301, was withdrawn in June 1975. A plan to shift the whole fleet to the South Island to join their smaller but more versatile DG siblings was proposed. They were to operate on the hilly Dunedin to Oamaru section of the Main South Line but a new locomotive type was chosen in the DJ class.
Preserved locomotive.
DF 1301, the first locomotive built, was placed on static display at Sim Pacific Metals Limited in Auckland, replacing K 900. As part of this it was renumbered to its original number of 1501, but with V-shaped nose stripes in place of the original wing-shaped ones. Initially displayed in the open, a limited shelter was built over the locomotive at a later date although this did not halt the progressive deterioration of the locomotive.
In 2007, the locomotive was purchased by the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand who concluded an agreement with the Diesel Traction Group, of Christchurch, to have the locomotive moved to their premises for restoration. The first stage of this relocation took place in August 2008 when 1501 was re-railed and then towed to Westfield Diesel Depot for assessment. In January 2009, members of the Group accompanied the locomotive on a three-day, 1,100 km trip to Christchurch, from where it moved to their Ferrymead Railway base a few days later.

Danny Law

Danny Law (born July 15, 1975) is a former English cricketer. Born in Lambeth, Law played for Sussex, Essex and Durham between 1993 and 2003.
During his debut List A performance for Sussex in June 1995, he managed to finish not out at number six by the close of innings in a 10-run victory. As he fell down the Sussex pecking order, he found himself out of the side in 1997, and instead playing for Essex, for whom, on his debut, in April 1997, he finished as expensive a bowler as he proved a pushover of a batsman, bowling two overs for 26 runs.
During his ten-year career, he scored fifteen half-centuries and two centuries, at a 20.35 average. He conceded exactly 7000 first-class bowling runs in all first-class matches, finishing eight times with a five-wicket haul.

<doc id="5877183" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877183" title="Microsoft Windows library files">
Microsoft Windows library files

The Microsoft Windows operating system supports a form of shared libraries known as dynamic-link libraries, which are code libraries that can be used by multiple processes while only one copy is loaded into memory. This article provides an overview of the core libraries that are included with every modern Windows installation, on top of which most Windows applications are built.
Internal components.
The library files in this section are not used directly by most programs; however, they are a dependency of other libraries that are used by programs.
Hal.dll.
The Windows Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is implemented in Hal.dll. The HAL implements a number of functions that are implemented in different ways by different hardware platforms. Other components in the operating system can then call these functions in the same way on all platforms, without regard for the actual implementation.
For example, responding to an interrupt is quite different on a machine with an Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) than on one without. The HAL creates one, use-all function that works with all kinds of interrupts by various chipsets.
The HAL is loaded into kernel address space and runs in kernel mode, so routines in the HAL cannot be called directly by applications, and no user mode APIs correspond directly to HAL routines. Instead, the HAL provides services primarily to the Windows executive and kernel and to kernel mode device drivers. Although drivers for most hardware are contained in other files, commonly of file type .sys, a few core drivers are compiled into Hal.dll.
Kernel mode device drivers for devices on buses such as PCI and PCI Express directly call routines in the HAL to access I/O ports and registers of their devices. The drivers use HAL routines because different platforms may require different implementations of these operations. The HAL implements the operations appropriately for each platform, so the same driver executable file can be used on all platforms using the same CPU architecture, and the driver source file can be portable across all architectures.
On x86 systems, there are several different HAL files on the installation media. The Windows installation procedure determines which ones are appropriate for the current platform and copies it to the hard drive, renaming it to Hal.dll if necessary. Among the criteria for this selection are: the presence of an ACPI-compatible BIOS, the presence of an APIC, and whether or not multiple processors are present and enabled. (The multiple cores of a multi-core CPU, and even the "logical processors" implemented by a hyperthreading CPU, all count as "processors" for this purpose.) On x86-64 and Itanium platforms there is just one possible Hal.dll for each CPU architecture.
If a PC running Windows 7 is turned on while missing Hal.dll (as would be the case if the system were restarted after deleting C:\Windows\System32), instead of starting normally, the screen will display white text on a black background(terminal style) stating that the system failed to start because of this file being nonexistent. Since it displays this file in the error message even if the entire System32 folder is deleted, this implies that it is the first file loaded during the boot process.
NTDLL.DLL.
NTDLL.DLL exports the Windows Native API.
The Native API is the interface used by user-mode components of the operating system that must run without support from Win32 or other API subsystems. Most of this API is implemented in NTDLL.DLL and at the upper edge of ntoskrnl.exe (and its variants), and the majority of exported symbols within these libraries are prefixed Nt, for example NtDisplayString. Native APIs are also used to implement many of the "kernel APIs" or "base APIs" exported by KERNEL32.DLL. The large majority of Windows applications do not call NTDLL.DLL directly.
Applications that are linked directly against this library are known as native applications;
the primary reason for their existence is to perform tasks that must run early in the system startup sequence before the Win32 subsystem is available. An obvious but important example is the creation of the Win32 subsystem process, csrss.exe.
Before the csrss.exe process exists, no Win32 processes may be created, therefore the process that creates it (Smss.exe, the "session manager") must be a native application. csrss.exe itself is a native application.
Despite having an ".exe" file extension, native applications cannot be executed by the user (or any program in the Win32 or other subsystems). An example is the autochk.exe binary that runs chkdsk during the system initialization "Blue Screen". Other prominent examples are the services that implement the various subsystems, such as csrss.exe.
Unlike Win32 applications, native applications instantiate within the Kernel runtime code (ntoskrnl.exe) and so they must have a different entry point (NtProcessStartup, rather than (w)(Win)MainCRTStartup as is found in a Win32 application), obtain their command-line arguments via a pointer to an in-memory structure, manage their own memory using the Rtl heap API,(which the Win32 heap APIs are just wrappers around -- no real difference there) and return execution with a call to NtTerminateProcess (as opposed to ExitProcess). A common library linked with Native applications is nt.lib, which contains startup code for Native applications, similar to how the C runtime provides startup code for Win32 apps.
Though most of the API is undocumented, Native Applications can be built using the Windows Driver Development Kit; many AntiVirus and other utility software vendors incorporate Native Applications within their products, usually to perform some boot-time task that cannot be carried out in userspace.
Win32 API.
The libraries in this section each implement various subsets of the Win32 API.
KERNEL32.DLL.
KERNEL32.DLL exposes to applications most of the Win32 base APIs, such as memory management, input/output (I/O) operations, process and thread creation, and synchronization functions. Many of these are implemented within KERNEL32.DLL by calling corresponding functions in the native API, exposed by NTDLL.DLL.
GDI32.DLL.
GDI32.DLL exports Graphics Device Interface (GDI) functions that perform primitive drawing functions for output to video displays and printers.
Applications call GDI functions directly to perform low-level drawing, text output, font management, and similar functions.
Initially, GDI supported 16 and 256 color EGA/VGA display cards and monochrome printers. The functionality has expanded over the years, and now includes support for things like TrueType fonts, alpha channels, and multiple monitors.
USER32.DLL.
USER32.DLL implements the Windows USER component that creates and manipulates the standard elements of the Windows user interface, such as the desktop, windows, and menus.
It thus enables programs to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that matches the Windows look and feel. Programs call functions from Windows USER to perform operations such as creating and managing windows, receiving window messages (which are mostly user input such as mouse and keyboard events, but also notifications from the operating system), displaying text in a window, and displaying message boxes.
Many of the functions in USER32.DLL call upon GDI functions exported by GDI32.DLL to do the actual rendering of the various elements of the user interface.
Some types of programs will also call GDI functions directly to perform lower-level drawing operations within a window previously created via USER32 functions.
COMCTL32.DLL.
COMCTL32.DLL implements a wide variety of standard Windows controls, such as File Open, Save, and Save As dialogs, progress bars, and list views.
It calls functions from both USER32.DLL and GDI32.DLL to create and manage the windows for these UI elements, place various graphic elements within them, and collect user input.
Other APIs.
SHSCRAP.DLL.
SHSCRAP.DLL is part of the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) mechanism.
It implements support for shell scrap files, which are automatically created when you drag selected content from an OLE-capable application into an Explorer window or desktop, but you can also use the Object Packager to create them.
They can then be dragged into another OLE-capable application.
This functionality was removed from Windows Vista (and therefore later versions) to improve security and rid the operating system of generally unused functionality. Scrap (.shs) files have been used by viruses because they can contain a wide variety of files (including executable code), and the file extension is not shown even when "Hide file extensions from known file types" is disabled. The functionality can be restored by copying registry entries and the DLL from a Windows XP system.
Runtime libraries.
MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCPP.DLL.
MSVCRT.DLL is the Microsoft Visual C Run-Time Library (MSVCPP.DLL being the C++ library) for Visual C++ version 4.2 to 6.0. It provides programs compiled with these versions of Visual C++ as well as a typical set of library functions required by C and C++ programs. These include string manipulation, memory allocation, C-style input/output calls, among others.
It has shipped with Windows versions since Windows 2000 for use by other Windows components. In older versions of Windows, programs which linked against MSVCRT.DLL were expected to install a compatible copy in the System32 folder, but this contributed to DLL Hell.
Versions of Visual C++ before 4.0 and since 7.0 have used differently named DLLs for each version (MSVCR20.DLL, MSVCR70.DLL, MSVCR71.DLL, MSVCP110.DLL etc.). Applications are required to install the appropriate version.
Microsoft Visual C++ Run-Time is included in Windows. Runtimes newer than installed OS are available in packages called Visual C++ Redistributables.
Source code for runtime libraries is included in Visual C++ for reference and debugging (e.g. in codice_1).
This runtime library is used by programs written in Visual C++ and a few other compilers (e.g. MinGW). Some compilers have their own runtime libraries.
.NET Framework libraries.
Programs written in C#, Visual Basic.NET, C++/CLI and other .NET languages require the .NET Framework. It has many libraries (one of them is mscorlib.dll — Multilanguage Standard Common Object Runtime Library, formerly Microsoft Common Object Runtime Library) and so-called assemblies (e.g. System.Windows.Forms.dll).

Area codes 918 and 539

Area codes 918 and 539 are telephone area codes serving northeast Oklahoma. These area codes cover the following major cities Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Bartlesville, McAlester, Gore, Jenks, Muskogee, Sapulpa, Tahlequah, Okmulgee, and northeastern Oklahoma. 
Area code 918 was created in 1953 as a split from area code 405. Area code 539 was created as an overlay for 918. It became active on April 1, 2011 (although 539 numbers could have been assigned for activation before that date). Mandatory dialing of ten-digit area codes became active on March 5, 2011. It is the first overlay in Oklahoma.
The other two area codes for Oklahoma are 405, which covers the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area and central Oklahoma, and 580, which covers western and southern Oklahoma.
Towns and cities served by these area codes.

Area code 912

Area code 912 is a US telephone area code serving the southeastern portion of the state of Georgia. It covers Savannah, Hinesville, Vidalia, Waycross, Brunswick, Douglas, Statesboro and Jesup.
History.
Area code 912 was split from area code 404 in 1954. When it was created, it covered the entire southern half of the state, including the cities of Savannah, Macon, and Albany.
This region of Georgia is not as densely populated as the north, despite the presence of Savannah and Macon. As a result, 912 remained unchanged for 46 years. By the start of the 21st century, it was obvious that all of south Georgia could not stay in 912. In addition to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, portions of the 912 territory were in LATAs that spill into Florida and South Carolina, further limiting the supply of numbers. On August 1, 2000, area code 912 was split into three parts, with Savannah and the eastern portion retaining 912. The western portion ( centered on Albany) became area code 229, while the northern portion ( centered on Macon) became area code 478. Permissive dialing continued throughout the old 912 territory until August 1, 2001.
Counties served.
Appling, Atkinson, Bacon, Brantley, Bryan, Bulloch, Camden, Candler, Charlton, Chatham, Clinch, Coffee, Echols (part with area code 229), Effingham, Emanuel (part with area code 478), Evans, Glynn, Jeff Davis, Liberty, Long, McIntosh, Montgomery, Pierce, Screven, Tattnall, Telfair (part with area code 229), Toombs, Treutlen, Ware, Wayne, and Wheeler.

The Fair at Sorochyntsi (short story)

The Fair at Sorochyntsi is the first story in the collection "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" by Ukrainian-born Russian writer Nikolai Gogol. Later in the 19th-century the story was adapted as an opera of the same name by Modest Mussorgsky (left unfinished by the composer, and completed by other hands).
Plot summary.
This story opens with the novice narrator described in Panko's introduction providing a literary description of the beauty of Ukraine (then known as "Little Russia") and sets the date in August 1800. The main characters of the story, Solopy Cherevik, his wife Khavronya Nikiforovna, and his daughter Paraska, are traveling to the fair to sell some items, including their old mare. 
A young man, called the "young man in the white jacket" at first - later we learn his name is Grytsko - finds Paraska beautiful and starts to flirt with her. When her father becomes agitated, the young man makes it known that he is the son of Cherevik's friend and wants to marry Paraska. Cherevik first accepts but later declines because of his constantly enraged spouse and the young man decides to figure out a way to get her, agreeing to give up his oxen for twenty rubles to a gypsy, if he helps him. While Khavronya is having a tryst with Afanasy Ivanovich, a priest's son, they hear a group of people coming to her house, so she quickly has the young man hide up in the rafters. The group comes in and Tsibulya, a friend of Cherevik, begins to tell the tale of the "red jacket," a jacket worn by a demon that was kicked out of hell. The jacket was put into the hands of a Jew, to be returned later, but the Jew sold the jacket and the demon got angry and tormented him by having a number of pig heads appear at his windows. The group gets frightened because the boy in the rafters grunts for a moment, but the storyteller continues. The jacket was eventually found to be cursed, and anyone who possessed it would not be able to sell anything, so it is pawned off to different peasants. 
Eventually, one determines he cannot sell his wares because of the jacket and chops it with an axe. It reforms, however, so he crosses himself and does it again, and the demon eventually had to come to collect the pieces of his jacket, and is down to the last fragment at the time the story is taking place. 
At the end of the tale, a pig's head appears at the window and the group becomes so frightened that Cherevik, with a basket on his head, runs out of the house while someone is screaming "devil" behind him. His wife jumps on him and they’re found in this state to the amusement of everyone. In the morning, after recovering from the embarrassment, Cherevik takes their mare to be sold at market. When he gets there someone asks him what he's selling and he wonders why they're asking this. Pulling on the harness, which causes him to strike himself in the face, he finds the horse is gone and a bit of a red jacket is left in place. He is accused of stealing his own horse and is bound up in a shed with his friend Tsibulya. The young man in the white jacket finds him there and agrees to release him if he can marry his daughter, to which Cherevik agrees. The story concludes with their marriage and the completion of the scheme, the "demon" being none other than the gypsy.

Area code 618

Area code 618 is the telephone area code serving southern Illinois, including the cities of Carbondale and Cairo. 618 also serves most of the Metro East region (the east side of the St. Louis area), including Alton, Belleville, East St. Louis, and Edwardsville. (The northern area of Metro East is in area code 217.)
618 was among the original North American area codes created in 1947. In 1954, most of Metro East switched from 217 to 618. 
618 is the only one of Illinois' four original area codes to have never been split or overlaid. Under current projections, however, 618 is expected to "exhaust" by 2016. The supply of numbers is further limited because much of 618 is part of the St. Louis LATA; some exchanges in Missouri's 314 and 636 are not available as "618-nxx" numbers.
Periodic proposals have been made for relief of the 618 area code. The most recent proposal has 618 overlaid with the unactivated 730.

Tomáš Fleischmann

Tomáš Fleischmann (born May 16, 1984) is a Czech professional ice hockey winger currently playing for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL).
Playing career.
Fleischmann originally played three years in his native Czech Republic as a junior with HC Vitkovice, playing in both the Under 18 and Under 20 level. As a prolific scorer, Fleischmann experienced his first taste of professional hockey late in the 2002 season appearing in 8 games out on loan with 3rd division team, HC Novy Jicin.
Fleischmann was subsequently drafted in the second round, 63rd overall, by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. With aspirations for a NHL career, Fleischmann immediately made the transition to North America by joining the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League for the 2002–03 season. In his first season, Fleischmann emerged as a leader on the offense for the Warriors finishing with 71 points in 65 games. Helping Moose Jaw reach the second round of the post season, he led the team with 11 assists and 15 points in 12 games.
In the 2003–04 season, Fleischmann improved his offensive numbers with Moose Jaw to post 30 goals and 75 points in 60 games and earn selection to the WHL East Second All-Star Team. During the campaign on February 27, 2004, Fleischmann's NHL rights were traded along with draft picks by the Red Wings to the Washington Capitals in exchange for fellow countryman Robert Lang.
On June 1, 2006, Fleischmann was signed by the Capitals to a three-year entry level contract. In his first full pro season, he was assigned to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Portland Pirates, for the duration of the 2004–05 season and contributed within a limited role with a modest 19 points in 53 games.
In the following 2005–06 season, Fleischmann started the year out in the AHL with new affiliate, the Hershey Bears. Scoring 13 points in his first 10 games of the year, he received his first recall to the Capitals on November 3, 2005. He then made his NHL debut the same day appearing for Washington in an 8-1 defeat against the Philadelphia Flyers. In his third game with the Capitals, he collected his first NHL point, an assist on a goal to Brian Willsie, in a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 6. Despite a near month long stay, he was returned to Hershey and under the tutelage of coach Bruce Boudreau progressed to lead the team with 30 goals in just 57 games. In the Calder Cup playoffs, Fleischmann helped carry the Bears to the Championship, leading the league with 21 assists and the team with 32 points in 20 games.
Fleischmann failed to make the Capitals opening night roster out of training camp for the 2006–07 season and scored 51 points in only 45 games in spending the majority of the first half of the season with the Bears. On February 24, 2007, Fleishmann scored his first NHL goal in a 4-2 victory against Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils. He remained in Washington to play in the team's final 21 games and on March 18, 2007, he recorded the first multi-point game of his career, scoring the first two goals of the game and assisting in two others to be named second star of the game in a 7-1 rout of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In returning to the AHL to help the Bears defend the Calder Cup, Fleischmann again led the team in the playoff scoring with 21 points in 19 games. Although suffering defeat in the finals to the Hamilton Bulldogs, for a second consecutive post-season he led the AHL in assists with 16.
Prior to the 2007–08 season, Fleischmann was re-signed by the Capitals to a one-year contract on October 1, 2007. Re-united with Boudreau early into his first full season in the NHL, he established a role as a skilled utility player within the Capitals and was re-signed to a two-year extension during the season on February 13, 2008. He finished to score 10 goals and 30 points in 75 games as the Capitals qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. Fleischmann made his post-season debut against the opening game against Philadelphia Flyers on April 11, 2008, but played in only two games in the Capitals eventual 7 game defeat in the Quarterfinals to the Flyers.
Fleischmann backed up his previous season appearing in 73 games and improving to score 19 goals and 37 points for the Capitals in 2008–09. He scored his first playoff goal in the opening game of the Quarterfinals 4-3 defeat to the New York Rangers on April 15, 2009. Appearing in all 14 playoff games for Washington he recorded 3 goals and 1 assist.
After returning to the Czech Republic in the off-season, Fleischmann was found to have developed a blood clot in his leg due to Deep vein thrombosis from the cross-Atlantic flight and would miss the pre-season and the start of the 2009–10 season. With an initial two-game stint with the Hershey Bears on a conditioning assignment, Fleischmann returned to the Capitals having missed the first 10 games. In a break out season with the Presidents' Trophy winning Capitals, Fleischmann posted a career high 23 goals and 51 points in 69 games. Fleischmann, however, suffered a disappointing post-season contributing only an assist in 6 games and was scratched for the deciding game of the series in a shock loss to the Montreal Canadiens.
On July 27, 2010, Fleischmann was re-signed as a restricted free agent to a one-year contract with the Capitals. Shifted to Center by Washington to start the 2010–11 season, Fleischmann failed to establish an offensive presence and was demoted as a depth player. On November 30, 2010, Fleischmann was traded by the Capitals to the Colorado Avalanche for Scott Hannan. Returning to Left Wing, he made his Avalanche debut in a 2-1 overtime defeat to the Carolina Hurricanes on December 3, 2010. In his fourth game his scored his first goal with Colorado in a 4-2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers on December 10, 2010. Five days later Fleischmann notched his first career NHL hat-trick in a 4-3 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. Fleischmann's torrid start with the Avalanche, scoring 21 points in 22 games, came to a sudden halt on January 20, when it was revealed that he was diagnosed with pulmonary emboli and would miss the remainder of the 2010–11 season.
Fleischmann signed a four-year contract worth $18 million with the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2011.
International play.
Fleischmann first represented the Czech Republic during his final junior year in the Czech Republic when he was named to the 2002 World Under 18 Championship squad. In 8 games in Slovakia, Fleischmann scored 1 goal and 2 assists as the Czech Republic defeated Finland 4-2 to capture the Bronze medal.
While with the Moose Jaw Warriors, Fleischmann earned consecutive selections in the Czech World Junior Championship squad's for 2003 and 2004 respective sixth and fourth place finishes. In 13 combined games, Fleischmann posted 4 goals and two assists.
After completing his first professional season with the Capitals in 2007–08, Fleischmann was added to his first senior Czech squad at the 2008 World Championships in Quebec, Canada. Fleischmann scored his first senior goal in a 5-0 shutout round-robin win over Switzerland on May 8, 2008. He completed the tournament with 5 points in 7 games as the Czech's finished in 5th place.
As a part of the Capitals highest scoring team in 2009–10, Fleishmann was selected mid-season to the Czech team for the 2010 Winter Olympics on December 30, 2009. Fleischmann scored 3 points in 5 games for the Czech Republic en route to a disappointing 7th place finish.

Cramauchenia

Cramauchenia is an extinct genus member of the litoptern order of South American mammals. "Cramauchenia" was named by Florentino Ameghino. The name has no literal translation. Instead, it is an anagram of the name of a related genus "Macrauchenia". This genus was initially discovered in the Sarmiento Formation in the Chubut Province, in Argentina, and later it was found in the Chichinales Formation in the Río Negro Province and the Cerro Bandera Formation in Neuquén, also in Argentina, in sediments assigned to the SALMA Colhuehuapian (in the Early Miocene). In 1981 Soria make to "C. insolita" a junior synonym of "C. normalis". A specimen of "C. normalis" was described in 2010 from Cabeza Blanca (Chubut, Argentina) in the Sarmiento Formation, in sediments assigned to the Deseadan SALMA(Upper Oligocene).

Geraldine Ulmar

Geraldine Ulmar (June 23, 1862 – August 13, 1932) was an American singer and actress, best known for her performances in soprano roles of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Life and career.
Annie Geraldine Ulmar was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. She began singing in amateur concerts as a child.
Ideal Opera and D'Oyly Carte years.
In 1879, she made her professional debut in the role of Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pinafore", aboard a ship in a lake in Boston's Oakland Garden. She soon joined the Boston Ideal Opera Company and remained with the company as leading soprano for the next six years, singing roles in "The Marriage of Figaro", "The Bohemian Girl", "Fra Diavolo", "Giralda ou La nouvelle psyché" by Adolphe Adam, "The Chimes of Normandy", "Fatinitza", "Giroflé-Girofla", "Czar and Carpenter", and in Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Ulmar next was hired to play Yum-Yum in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's first American production of "The Mikado", at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York, from 1885 to 1886, in a cast that included George Thorne (Ko-Ko), Courtice Pounds (Nanki-Poo), and Fred Billington (Pooh-Bah). She joined a D'Oyly Carte touring company in England, singing Yum-Yum and Josephine for a few months, then Yum-Yum in the German company, before returning to America in the summer of 1886. D'Oyly Carte released her to play for an American manager, John Stetson, at the end of 1886, for whom she played in Carte-approved productions in New York of "Princess Ida" (in the title role) and "The Mikado" (as Yum-Yum) and then in Boston in the title role of "Patience".
In early 1887, Ulmar rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in England, where she rehearsed the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera, "Ruddygore" (later renamed "Ruddigore"), played Rose Maybud in two matinee performances at the Savoy Theatre, and then returned to New York to play Rose in the American production. In May 1887, she returned to London to play Rose at the Savoy and remained there to play the soprano roles in the 1888 London revivals of "Pinafore", "The Pirates of Penzance" (Mabel) and "The Mikado". "The Times" wrote, in 1887, that "she is born to the manner of the peculiar form of art invented by and Sullivan. Her voice, although not very powerful, is quite capable of dealing with the composer's short-skirted airs, and the occasional dose of sentiment ... is quite within her reach... Miss Ulmar’s style must be called a little "prononcé". Her accents in the music, her treatment of the dialogue, and most of all, her by-play, are coloured a trifle more highly than is altogether compatible with the very subdued and refined tone of the general picture, which forms one of the most attractive features of the genre. At the same time she eschews any approach to vulgarity". Ulmar originated the leading soprano roles of Elsie Maynard in "The Yeomen of the Guard" (1888), and Gianetta in "The Gondoliers" (1889) before leaving D'Oyly Carte in 1890.
Later years.
She remained in London to play Marton in "La Cigale" (1890–91) by Edmond Audran and F. C. Burnand, and next appeared as Teresa in W. S. Gilbert and Alfred Cellier's "The Mountebanks" (1892) and Guinevere Block in "Little Christopher Columbus" (1893–94). Beginning in 1896, she toured as O Mimosa San in "The Geisha" with George Edwardes's touring company. Her last stage role was Jane Jingle in "Ladyland" (1904). Ulmar then turned to teaching singing. Some of her students became well known, including Jose Collins and Evelyn Laye.
For part of the 1890s, she was married to composer Ivan Caryll. She died in Merstham Surrey, England.

<doc id="5877272" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877272" title="New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)">
New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)

The New Zealand DF class locomotive of 1979 is a class of 30 Co-Co diesel-electric locomotives built by General Motors Diesel of Canada between 1979 and 1981. Between 1992 and 1997, all the locomotives were rebuilt as the DFT class, a turbocharged version of the DF.
The class should not be confused with the English Electric NZR DF class of 1954; as all of the old DFs had been retired by mid-1975, the 'DF' classification was free to be re-used.
Design.
The DFs were powered by an EMD 12-645 engine, the same prime mover chosen for the DC class, but were able to make greater use of that power by having six traction motors and Co-Co arrangement as opposed to the four traction motors and A1A-A1A wheel arrangement of the DCs. This gave the DF several advantages: a tractive effort of and a maximum speed of , compared to the DCs and . The most noticeable visual difference between the DF and the DC is that the DF is considerably longer with the headlight arrangement on the cabs differing: the DC has the lights arranged horizontally, while the DF has them arranged vertically. The DF is more often confused with the DX class, as both are of similar dimensions though the DX also has the horizontal headlight arrangement.
In service.
History.
The first 20 members of the DF class arrived in New Zealand in 1979, and initially ten worked on the East Coast Main Trunk, Kinleith, Rotorua and Murupara Branches, making use of the recently opened Kaimai Tunnel; and ten worked freight trains on the Main North Line between Christchurch and Picton. At the time, they were the most powerful locomotives in the South Island, with a total power output of .
The next ten DFs arrived in 1981 and were also sent to work in the Bay of Plenty, and some to supplement the South Island fleet, which by this time had also entered service on the Main South Line and Midland Line as far as Arthur's Pass.
In 1986 the DF fleet was reallocated, concentrating 22 of the class in the South Island, and reallocating the remaining eight North Island DFs from Hamilton to Wellington, for use between Wellington and Gisborne, on the Wairarapa Line and Palmerston North - Gisborne Line (PNGL).
In 1988, the fleet was again reallocated due to the opening of the NIMT electrification, with approximately 20 DFs based in Auckland for use in Northland, and between Auckland, Hamilton and the ECMT and its branches. The remaining units were based in the South Island. This removed the DFs from the lower North Island - Gisborne routes, and reduced the number in the South Island.
Rebuilding to DFT.
The main downside to the DF was the lack of power output from the diesel engine. This hindered the DF when it came to hauling heavy freight trains out of multiple.
In 1992, DF 6260 was rebuilt with a new turbocharged diesel engine and some other minor alterations. The rebuilt DF was reclassified DFT (the T standing for turbocharged), and renumbered 7008.
After 18 months of trial, the decision was made to convert the remaining 29 DFs to DFTs, with the last unit converted in 1997. The turbocharged locos can now generate , and now comfortably fits between the DC class and the DX class in terms of power output.
Current.
The class remains predominantly employed on general freight duties on all routes nationwide, with the general exception of through trains on the NIMT and the Midland Line coal workings. The units operate both in multiple with the other mainline locomotive classes, or as single units, depending on availability and the level of motive power required.
Although less common, the units see occasional use on the KiwiRail Scenic Journeys passenger services. Being such handy units this class sees far more inter-island transfers than the other classes.
Auckland Transport service.
Three DFTs/DFBs are currently in service in Auckland hauling six car SA trains on the Auckland suburban network, leased by Auckland Transport. These trains are made up of ex-British Rail Mark 2 carriages, rebuilt for use on Auckland commuter trains. Most are currently in four or five car configurations with a DC class locomotive. The locomotives currently in service on 6 car SA sets are DFBs 7200 and 7348, and DFT 7104. These began service on 20 September 2010 with the introduction of a new timetable. DFB 7010 was also employed on Auckland service from this date, but was released back to KiwiRail in November 2012 leaving just the three units operating. Other DFTs have been assigned periodically to cover for when these units under go maintenance, with DFT 7051 and DFB 7186 most recently filling this role during the 2011 Rugby World Cup when extra six car trains were in use. The remaining locomotives in service with Auckland Transport (7104, 7200 and 7348) have been installed with Electronic Train Protection (ETP) equipment.
Numbering.
In common with NZR practice at the time the class was numbered with reference to the power output (1,650 hp), with the first 20 units numbered 1651 to 1670. With the introduction of the TMS system in 1980 these locomotives were renumbered in order with new four digit numbers starting with 6 in which the last number acted as a check number; DF 1651 became DF 6006 and DF 1670 becoming DF 6202. The second batch all received TMS numbers while under construction. They were then renumbered again when rebuilt to DFT standard in the 7xxx series, with these numbers allocated as they were rebuilt with no reference to their previous number.
Vision upgrades.
Prior to the rebuilding to DFT standard, the locomotives received an upgrade in the late 1980s with the introduction of single-manning to improve visibility for the driver - this involved a large single front window replacing the original configuration that had two small windows instead.
In the late 1990s the drivers side front window was enlarged to prevent eye and back problems for drivers focusing on the mainline ahead. The pillar separating the driver's window and the central window created a potentially dangerous blind spot and caused a distraction for drivers as their vision had to adjust to focus, or alternatively adopt unnatural sitting positions. Drivers started to notice left-eye fatigue and back issues after long shifts or extended periods driving the locomotives. The pillar was moved 100mm to the left with the top and bottom sills was raised and lowered at the same time to give drivers a better view of the track immediately in front and below. Fewer issues have been reported since.
Livery.
The DF class were initially delivered in the International Orange "fruit salad" (red, grey and yellow) livery, or the variation "flying tomato" (same though without the grey), which they wore through until the 1990s. As part of the rebuilding to DFT they were repainted into the Cato Blue livery (Fruit Salad with blue in place of red), with some later receiving the Bumble Bee (black and yellow) and Tolls' Corn Cob (green and yellow) schemes. Units are now being repainted into KiwiRail's yellow, red and grey scheme, with those on lease to Auckland Transport painted in the MAXX Blue (deep blue and yellow) livery.
DF 6133 (now DFB 7307) was the only unit to receive a non-Fruit Salad livery as a DF, wearing a Tasman Forestry scheme in the early 1990s. DFs 6006 (now DFB 7239), 6012 (now DFT 7145), 6029 (now DFB 7173) and 6058 (DFT 7254, now DFB 7348) were repainted in the Flying Tomato livery.
Ownership.
In December 1996, Tranz Rail sold the DFT class to the General American Transportation Corporation (GATX, an American locomotive and rolling stock leasing company) for $131.5 million. It then leased the locomotives back for a period of 12 years. The lease ended on 19 December 2008 with ownership of the locomotives going to Tranz Rail's successor, KiwiRail, which paid a further $36.6m to buy the locomotives back.
Sub-classes.
In the early 2000s a number of DFTs were fitted with the Maxitrax wheelslip control and received an internal sub-classification of DFM. This was used in the Amicus computer system only, and the classification was initially not applied to the locomotives themselves which remained identified as DFT. Although Maxitrax has since been removed from these locomotives the units some of the units that were classed as DFM have had the designation applied to them when repainted into the KiwiRail livery.
In 2006 Toll Rail began installing the Brightstar engine management system into a number of DFT class locomotives, with these locomotives then officially reclassified as DFB. In all 12 locomotives have received Brightstar, with these locomotives currently undergoing a 'DFB overhaul' programme.
Withdrawals.
, three DF units has been withdrawn from service. DFT 7117 was withdrawn in 2013 following an accident north of Kaikoura in 2011. It is stored at Hutt Workshops and has been used as a source of spare parts for the other locomotives. It was believed that the other 17 remaining DFTs would be withdrawn after the second batch of DLs arrive, owing to the decision to refurbish only the 12 DFB locomotives. However despite the second 20 DLs now being in service only DFTs 7049 and 7322 have been withdrawn.
Accidents.
A number of DF class locomotives have been involved in derailments and level crossing accidents that have required repair. The most significant incident involving a DF unit was a head-on collision between DFT 7254 and DC 4202 and DX 5448 at Waipahi in Otago in 1999, in which the driver of the DFT was killed and the locomotive suffered considerable frontal damage. After a lengthy period in storage it was repaired and returned to service renumbered as DFB 7348.

Brer Soul

Brer Soul is the debut studio album of Melvin Van Peebles. Released in 1969, the album introduced Van Peebles as a recording artist, following his work as an independent filmmaker, playwright and novelist. It is notable for its use of sprechgesang, a vocal style which lies between speaking and singing.
Unlike later albums, which are more varied in style, "Brer Soul" features an experimental spoken word style, with soul jazz instrumentation. Van Peebles' unconventional songwriting style has since been cited as an influence on hip hop music and rapping.
Background.
While living in France, Van Peebles began to write plays in French which were intended to express the ghetto's turmoil and pathos. Van Peebles used the sprechgesang vocal style in these plays as a form he could tell stories in. This style formed the basis of his debut as a recording artist, "Brer Soul", which was categorized as a spoken word album.
Style.
"Brer Soul" features Van Peebles delivering spoken lyrics accented by soul jazz grooves. Allmusic writer Ed Hogan compares Van Peebles' vocals to "Louis Armstrong, the comedy albums of Bill Cosby from the '70s, and the wild antics of cartoon voice artists Mel Blanc and ". Another Allmusic writer, Thom Jurek, compared Van Peebles' delivery to that of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Van Peebles describes his vocal style as "the old Southern style", which was influenced by singers he had heard growing up in South Chicago. Van Peebles also said that he was influenced by older forms of African-American music: "[...] people like Blind Lemon Jefferson and the field hollers. I was also influenced by spoken word song styles from Germany that I encountered when I lived in France."
The music is more jazz-oriented and less beat-conscious than that of other spoken word artists, such as the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron. Writer Darius James described the music as being minimalist and similar to that of Charles Mingus. While the album contains socially conscious themes, it primarily reflects stream of consciousness rather than political activism or rebellion. Allmusic writer Richie Unterberger describes Van Peebles' lyrics as "portraits of romantic losers, a women's house of detention, and admiring the neighborhood foxes, all delivered in Van Peebles' brand of hipster jive."
Reception and legacy.
"Brer Soul" has been cited as influencing rapping and hip hop music. Describing the album, Darius James called the album "'spoken-word' performance at its raw best." Allmusic gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with writer Richie Unterberger calling it "an interesting antecedent to the use of spoken prose in African-American R&B-derived music." In 2010, the album was released on compact disc by RPM, with liner notes by Van Peebles commenting on the album's production and lyrics.

Forbes Carlile

Forbes Carlile MBE (born 3 June 1921) was Australia's first post-World War II Olympics swimming coach and later Australia's first competitor in the modern pentathlon at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He remains the only person to have coached and later competed at the Olympic Games.
Born in Armadale, Victoria, Carlile is best known as a pioneer in swimming coaching. Together with his wife, Ursula, and their assistant, Tom Green, he produced many notable olympians such as Shane Gould, Karen Moras, Gail Neall, John Davies, Terry Gathercole, John Ryan and Ian O'Brien. In 1972, 15-year-old Gould held world records simultaneously in the 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1500 metres freestyle and the 200m individual medley.
Carlile started testing his physiological knowledge in 1944 at the Enfield pool with two young schoolboys from Canterbury Boys High School. He first started coaching in 1946 at the Palm Beach rock pool, north of Sydney. Success there led to him being appointed as the Australian swimming coach for the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and he then went on to be head Australian coach again at the 1956 Games in Melbourne and Scientific Advisor in the 1960 Games in Rome. At the 1964 Games he was head coach for the Dutch Olympic team. He was head Australian swimming coach at the Swimming World Championships in Belgrade in 1973 which produced nine Australian World Champions. He withdrew as head coach at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
Carlile studied at The Scots College, Sydney and the University of Sydney under Professor Frank Cotton, graduating with a Masters of Science and later lecturing there in human physiology. His pioneering work on elite athlete training methods included interval workouts, pace clocks and log books, heart rate tests, training under stress and T Wave studies of the ventricles. He developed techniques such as even-paced swimming and the use of two-beat kicks for long-distance events.
His book, "Forbes Carlile on Swimming" (London. 1963), was the first modern book on competitive swimming with its study of "tapering" and the historical development of the crawl. Other books by Carlile include: "A History of Crawl Stroke Techniques to the 1960s: An Australian Perspective" and "A History of Australian Swimming Training".
In 1977, Carlile was awarded an MBE and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Other awards include the Queens Jubilee Medal (1977), Sport Australia Hall of Fame (1989), ASI Life Member (2003) and NSSA Hall of Fame (2003).
His swimming school still operates today in a number of locations in and around Sydney.

Abbot of Melrose

The Abbot and then Commendator of Melrose was the head of the monastic community of Melrose Abbey, in Melrose in the Borders region of Scotland. The abbots of the earlier Northumbrian foundation from Lindisfarne are not included here. The second abbey was founded in 1136 on the patronage of David I ("Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim"), King of Scots, by Cistercian monks from Rievaulx Abbey, Yorkshire. Control of the abbey was secularized in the 16th century and after the accession of James Stewart, the abbey was held by commendators. The last commendator, James Douglas of Lochleven, resigned the abbacy to William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton (his nephew) in December 1606, and the abbey itself to the king in 1608. The abbey (or most of its lands) was then erected into a secular lordship for viscount Haddington, John Ramsay, who in 1609 was created "Lord Melrose".

Protein–energy malnutrition

Protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) or protein–calorie malnutrition refers to a form of malnutrition where there is inadequate calorie or protein intake.
[[Image:Protein-energy malnutrition world map - DALY - WHO2002.svg|thumb|right|350px|Disability-adjusted life year for protein–energy malnutrition per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002.
Types include:
Note that this may also be secondary to other conditions such as chronic renal disease or cancer cachexia in which protein energy wasting may occur.
Protein–energy malnutrition affects children the most because they have less protein intake. The few rare cases found in the developed world are almost entirely found in small children as a result of fad diets, or ignorance of the nutritional needs of children, particularly in cases of milk allergy.
Prenatal protein malnutrition.
Protein malnutrition is detrimental at any point in life, but protein malnutrition prenatally has been shown to have significant lifelong effects. During pregnancy, one should aim for a diet that consists at least 20% protein for the health of the fetus. Diets that consist of less than 6% protein "in utero" have been linked with many deficits, including decreased brain weight, increased obesity, impaired communication within the brain. Even diets of mild protein malnutrition (7.2%) have been shown to have lasting and significant effects. The following are some studies in which prenatal protein deficiency has been shown to have unfavorable consequences.
From these studies it is possible to conclude that prenatal protein nutrition is vital to the development of the fetus, especially the brain, the susceptibility to diseases in adulthood, and even gene expression. When pregnant females of various species were given low-protein diets, the offspring were shown to have many deficits. These findings highlight the great significance of adequate protein in the prenatal diet.

Witchblade (anime)

As of December 2008, in the USA and Canada there were 6 Volumes on DVD available, with Vol. 1 having been released in September 2007. There is also a full boxed set containing all 24 episodes and an extra disc with special features. A Blu-ray box set was released on November 3, 2009.
The anime was directed by Yoshimitsu Ohashi, who directed "Galaxy Angel" and "Galaxy Angel Z", and the characters were designed by Uno Makoto, the character designer for "Stellvia" and "Love Hina".
Story.
In this new approach to the "Witchblade" universe, the lead character (and blade wielder) is Masane Amaha, a kind-hearted woman who, despite her good intentions, is fairly clumsy and not good around the house. She lost her memory during "The Great Quake" that ravaged Tokyo and, curiously, Masane was found unscathed in the phenomenon's ground zero, holding a baby in her arms. Six years later, she returns to Tokyo with the child, whom she believes to be her daughter, intending to live a peaceful life. Unfortunately for the two, Masane becomes entangled in the struggle for power between a huge corporation and a government agency. She discovers that a mysterious jewel attached to her right wrist is actually the legendary artifact known as the Witchblade.
Differences in the DVD and TV versions.
Due to the original version of the witchblade costume showing far too much skin, the series recolored most of the said areas into black for broadcast in Japan. These blackened portions were returned to the original coloring for the DVD release of the series. (The DVD version is what IFC and other international networks are showing on cable TV.) The DVDs also contain many instances where the animation is cleaned up compared to the TV broadcast and in some cases whole frames are completely redrawn. The TV episodes are rated TV-MA in the United States.

Maryland Horse Industry Board

The Maryland Horse Industry Board (MHIB) is an agency which is part of the Maryland Department of Agriculture in the United States. The MHIB, originally the State Board of Inspection of Horse Riding Stables, was established by Maryland statute in 1968. It was made part of the Department of Licensing and Regulation in 1970. The Board transferred to the Department of Agriculture in 1980. In October 1998 the duties and name of the MHIB were altered. The change resulted from a statutory change lobbied for by the Maryland Horse Council, a member organization of the American Horse Council. The duties of the MHIB expanded beyond stable licensing to include:
- promoting the use and development of horses in Maryland;
- support research related to equine health and related issues;
- creating public awareness of the value of equine activities as they relate to the green space preservation; 
- developing and disseminating information concerning the equine industry; and
- advising the Department of Agriculture regarding matters affecting the horse industry in the State.
There are 12 members of the MHIB, including the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Agriculture, appointed by the Governor. Those members serve four year terms and represent specific sectors or organizations of the horse industry. Those sectors or organizations include:
- Trade and Support Businesses;
- Officers of County Humane Societies;
- Trails and Recreational Riding;
- Organized Competitions and Shows;
- Thoroughbreds;
- Standardbreds;
- Academic Equine Community;
- Licensed Veterinarians;
- Maryland Horse Council;
- Licensed Stable Operators; and
- The General Public.
The Chairman of the MHIB is elected annually by the Board. Since 1998 the chairmen of the MHIB have included:
- Gregory Gingery (1998-2004)
- James B. Steele (2004–present)
The MHIB employs a staff at its discretion. The Executive Director position is currently staffed by Ross Peddicord; it was previously staffed from 2003 - 2010 by J. Robert "Rob" Burk, the Stable Inspectors are Pegeen Morgan and Keziah "Kezie" Richard and the part-time Administrative Assistant is Tonya Jones. 
The MHIB has overseen several high profile projects for the horse industry in Maryland including the Maryland Equine Census, the Maryland Horse Park project, the Mid-Atlantic International Import and Export Equine Center, and the Maryland Horse Forum. Additionally, in order to fulfill its entire mission since 1999 the MHIB has awarded grants to non-profit and not-for-profit projects benefiting the Maryland horse industry. In 2003, it awarded a $5,000 grant to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center, part of the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine.

Lamigo Monkeys

The Lamigo Monkeys (), formerly First Financial Holdings Agan (第一金控金剛, abbreviated 第一金剛) and then the La New Bears (La New 熊), are a professional baseball team in the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan. Owned and administered by the Kaohsiung-based shoe-producing La New Corporation, the Bears qualified for the playoffs in 2006 for the first time in team history, and by finishing with the best record for the whole season, gained an automatic berth in the Taiwan Series.
The Bears played their home games at Chengcing Lake Baseball Field in Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City) from 2004 to 2010. In the 2011 season, their home stadium was moved to Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium. Accordingly, the team's name was changed to the Lamigo Monkeys.
History.
First Financial Holdings Agan.
Sometimes known as the First Securities Agan, the Agan was owned by the First Financial Holding Corporation, a government-funded financial holding service institute. Its then-chairman Chen Chien-lung (陳建隆) was a keen political supporter of President Chen Shui-bian, and, upon the president's request, immediately agreed to take over one of the two former TML teams after TML was merged into CPBL in January 2003. Since Macoto Bank had already decided to take-over the Macoto Gida, Chen Chien-lung took over the Agan as promised. Interestingly, the bulk of Agan's player came from Taipei Gida and Kaohsiung-Pingtung Fala, and not the Taichung Agan which carried the same mascot and the champion of the final season of TML. Agan played its home games at Chengcing Lake Baseball Field.
Without a strong roster plus the management's inexperience and unprofessionalism in running a professional sports club, the Agan performed poorly right from the start of the 2003 season. After Chen Chien-lung's sudden resignation due to allegation of insider trading in August 2003, the First Financial Holding Corporation no longer showed willingness in running the team. The Agan finished the 2003 season placing fifth overall, and did not win any of the 20 games against Brother Elephants, the Taiwan Series champion of that season.
La New Bears.
Just before the 2004 season, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing invited La New Corporation, a footwear manufacture to sponsor the then-vacant Chengcing Lake Baseball Field, which was under the management of Kaohsiung County after the disbandment of Taiwan Major League. La New Corporation eventually agreed and, in addition, offered to buy First Financial Holdings Agan, whose management has been struggling in the past season. On December 16, 2003, La New completed the process with First Financial Holdings and renamed the team La New Bears. In the first two years of their existence, the Bears did not perform well. But after several addition to the roster through drafts and the minor league, the Bears turned the team around, eventually winning the 2006 Taiwan Series title. The Bears did not win any title since then.
Lamigo Monkeys.
After several years of futile effort to manage the Kaohsiung market, the team relocated to Taoyuan County and changed its name to Lamigo Monkeys in January 2011. Lamigo is a subsidiary of La New Corporation that operates a wellness center, restaurants as well as a travel agency in northern Taiwan. Since Lamigo is based in northern Taiwan, the team was moved to Taoyuan County and play their home games at Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium. Their new name in Chinese, "taoyuan" (桃猿), is a homophone to their new home county. Despite the name change, La New Corporation retained its direct ownership of the team. In 2012, the Monkeys won their first seasonal title after the name change when they defeated Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions four games to one in Taiwan Series.

Rothaar Mountains

The Rothaar Mountains (, also "Rotlagergebirge"), or Rothaar, is a low mountain range reaching heights of up to 843.1 m in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, Germany.
It is believed that its name must once have been "Rod-Hard-Gebirge", or "the cleared forest mountain range", as the range has nothing whatsoever to do with the colour red ("rot" in German), nor with hair ("Haar").
Geography.
Location.
The thickly wooded Rothaar, rich in mineral deposits, is found mostly in Westphalia between the Sauerland in the north, the Upland (northeastern foothills of the Rothaar) in the northeast, Wittgenstein Land in the southeast and the Siegerland in the southwest; only the range's southeastern foothills are actually in Hesse. It stretches from the upper Eder and the Lenne from the "Kahler Asten" (841 m) southwest of the Winterberg Tableland ("Winterberger Hochfläche") some 30 km to the southwest and drops off steeply towards the west, but much less sharply towards the east.
The Rothaar is a narrow, banklike, mostly over 600 m high mountain chain forming geologically a large northeastern part of the Rhine Massif ("Rheinisches Schiefergebirge"). Since the land's elevation averages quite high, the mountains themselves, up to the 843.1 m-high "Langenberg" hardly stand out from each other.
The Rothaar Mountains are more or less co-extensive with the Rothaar Mountain Nature Park, parts of which do, however, reach into neighbouring geological areas, such as the ones named here.
Bodies of water.
In the northern Rothaar rise, among others, the rivers Diemel, Lenne, Neger, Nuhne, Odeborn, Orke, Ruhr, Wenne and Wilde Aa. In the south rise the Dill, Eder, Ferndorfbach, Ilse, Lahn and Sieg. Over the range runs the Rhine-Weser watershed. In the farthest southwest of the Rothaar are the Obernau and Breitenbach dams.
Mountains.
Among the best known (but not necessarily the highest) of the Rothaar's peaks, which consist partly of porphyry, are (including all ""Achthunderter"", or "eight-hundreders", sorted by height):
The German Wikipedia has a more exhaustive list of the Rothaar's many peaks.
Places.
In the Rothaar Mountains and/or the Rothaar Mountain Nature Park or their outskirts are found, among others, these municipalities:
Activities.
Many hiking trails run through the Rothaar Mountains, among others the "Rothaar Path", a 154 km-long trail through the heights, and the "Waldskulpturenweg" ("Forest Sculpture Way") along which are found various sculptures and other artworks by different artists.
In winter, many sporting opportunities beckon visitors to the range. Suitable facilities for this include the Postwiesen skiing area (near Neuastenberg), the "Skiliftkarussell Winterberg" and "Snow World Züschen".
Within or on the outskirts of the Rothaar are found the "Panorama-Park Sauerland" and "Fort Fun Abenteuerland" amusement parks.
Free-ranging wisents?
The club Taurus Naturentwicklung e. V. in cooperation with the "Wittgenstein-Berleburg'sche Rentkammer" and the internationally active Large Herbivore Foundation (LHF), and with the involvement of the Hochsauerland biological station, is preparing to reintroduce free-ranging wisents into the Rothaar Mountains (Sauerland, North Rhine-Westphalia). The project is, however, not without its controversy in the region, with cultivators in particular worrying about possible damage that the creatures might do.

Swing, Swing

"Swing, Swing" is a song by American rock band The All-American Rejects, released as their debut single from their self-titled debut studio album on December 2, 2002.
Background.
"Swing, Swing" was written by Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter. According to Ritter, the song was written in his grandparents' cabin in his hometown of Stillwater in Oklahoma when he came up with the chorus one weekend morning. "My ex-girlfriend and I had a rough relationship, and that was written when it sucked real bad," Ritter explained, "I liked this other chick, so that's what the second verse is about, moving on to a hotter chick - no I'm just kidding. Moving on to another girl... or just moving on." 
The song was also one of the last to be written and recorded for the duo's self titled debut album "It was over and done with a year ago," Ritter said of the misery-inducing relationship that also inspired many other tear-jerking pop songs, such as "My Paper Heart" and "Don't Leave Me." "But I got a great record out of it... as far as lyrics. I didn't have to think too hard." 
Reception.
Critical reception.
The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Rockfeedback, who rated the track 3 out of 5 stars, reviewed the song as "Very polished, insanely catchy, and heart-on-sleeve this record is. Dramatically expressive lyrics ('Did you think that I would cry, on the phone...?', 'My heart is crushed by a former love!'), ultra-glossy production and a ridiculously infectious chorus: you wouldn't bet against them." Contactmusic.com said "The melody is appealing and its pop punk sounds like something from Simple Plan or Blink 182. The lyrics are slightly baffling with 'swing, swing, swing from the tangles of' - a classic example." 
MusicOMH regarded "Swing, Swing" as "top form" and commented with "These small-town American, fun rockers are hard to dislike. Swing Swing swings along pleasantly enough, developing from an organ intro to a good-natured, old-style rock out that does just what you expect it to. Rock, that is", while CityLife praised the track as "imaginative" and that "The use of a church organ gives way to a totally catchy - if formulaic - college rock anthem. Vocals are typically American high-pitched angst, while the simple "Swing-Swing" chorus should guarantee favourable radio play on both sides of the Atlantic." 
Chart performance.
Upon release, "Swing, Swing" gained attention on Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ-FM and WXRK in New York City. When "The All-American Rejects" was re-released in early 2003, "Swing, Swing" gained more commercial success; peaking at #8 on the US "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart in March, #60 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and #13 UK Singles Charts in August for five weeks respectively. 
"Swing, Swing" was digitally released later in 2005; reaching #75 on the "Billboard" Hot Digital Songs, it also briefly returned to the UK Singles Chart in April 2009 at #99. 
Music video.
The music video for "Swing, Swing" was directed by Marcos Siega and shot in December 2002 in Los Angeles and was released on January 7, 2003. It involves the band performing the song in a small trailer park while scenes of a young couple going through their relationship are overlapped through the video - eventually ending with them breaking up.
Appearances in popular culture.
"Swing, Swing" is featured on the soundtrack of the American comedy film "American Wedding", the video games "", "Lego Rock Band", "MVP Baseball 2003" and on the compilation album "Sky High Invasion - Volume 1" as a remix by DJ Loopy. Television-wise, the song has appeared in the American action series "Smallville", the pilot episode of teen drama "The OC", the British topical news comedy show "Russell Howard's Good News" and was covered by the cast of the British drama series "All the Small Things" in character.

<doc id="5877435" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877435" title="Kamikaze (ride)">
Kamikaze (ride)

A Kamikaze (also known as a Double-Arm Ranger, The Apollo, or the Skymaster and Sky Flyer) is a pendulum amusement ride, usually found as a traveling ride, with some examples found at amusement parks. The ride is manufactured by FarFabbri & Sartori, and first made its debut in 1984. Since then, over 150 Kamikazes have been sold.
Design and operation.
The ride consists of a single stationary tower, supporting two 16-passenger gondolas on rotating arms. Passengers are arranged in rows of two, with the first four rows facing in one direction, and the other four facing opposite. During the ride, passengers are swung backwards and forwards to build up momentum, before the gondola performs several inversions. The two gondolas are connected to the motor so that they swing simultaneously; with one arm rotating clockwise while the other rotates counterclockwise
Passengers are restrained by a shoulder harness, as well as a secondary locking bar across their laps. Compressed air is used to actuate the shoulder harness, with a fail-safe mechanism which engages the shoulder harness in the event of power failure. The loss of compressed air also causes the shoulder harnesses to engage. In addition, the gondola's sides and roof are made up of closely spaced metal bars, allowing riders to see the world outside, while preventing anyone from falling out while the ride is in motion. Like most ride safety measures, these are only effective if safety and height restrictions are enforced. To date, the only deaths or severe injuries caused on a kamikaze ride have been caused by a failure to follow the height restrictions, or complacency on the part of the operator or deck personnel. Most carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks require riders to be at least 48 inches (122 cm) or taller.
The entire ride can be stowed on a single trailer which requires a special permit to travel in the Continental United States, and can be assembled or disassembled in less than five hours, by two trained workers.
Older Kamikaze rides were powered by a DC motor, coupled to a drive shaft which traveled up the tower to drive the rotating arms, but newer models are powered by the same DC motor mounted directly to a gearbox mounted at the top of the tower. This gearbox is manufactured by Brevini in Italy, with a coupling box made by PTG. The same planetary gear used can be found on a large quantity of earth movers all over Europe.
Variants.
Similar designs have been produced by A.R.M. (Skymaster), Topfun, Meisho, Mondial (Sky Flyer), and Vekoma (Sky Flyer). There is a version of the ride called the Footloose, where the riders feet are dangling below the car. There is also a park model manufactured by Zamperla called the Hawk 48 where riders' feet dangle below the seats.

Muir Island Saga

The "Muir Island Saga" is a five-part Marvel Comics crossover event involving the X-Men and X-Factor, published in 1991. It was written by Chris Claremont and Fabian Nicieza.
Plot.
After warnings from Forge and Banshee, the X-Men and Professor X investigate Muir Island, whose inhabitants have been taken over by the Shadow King. They are captured by the inhabitants. Professor X returns to his mansion, now in ruins after the Inferno storyline, to use Cerebro, only to find Stevie Hunter on the run from Colossus, also controlled by the Shadow King. Professor X battles Colossus and frees him from the Shadow King's control, but he is forced to strip away the Peter Nicholas persona he had been using since passing through the Siege Perilous. Xavier decides to call in his original students, now forming the team X-Factor.
On Muir Island, Wolverine separates himself from his party and is attacked and freed from control by Forge. Rogue appears, ready to attack, but she too is taken out by Forge. The three regroup, but are quickly attacked by Banshee, who is also quickly taken down and freed. Banshee explains that Shadow King has been using Polaris as a nexus between the physical world and the Astral Plane since the time Zaladane stripped Polaris of her magnetism powers. Using her new powers to absorb negative energy for superhuman strength, Shadow King plans on becoming all-powerful. They fear that to break that connection and defeat him, they may have to kill Polaris.
With X-Factor gathered, Professor X plans a strike on Muir Island using resources provided by Val Cooper. X-Factor lands on the island and quickly neutralizes its defenses. Back at the base, Professor X is attacked directly by the Shadow King, using his host body Jacob Reisz, who thinks he has control of all those present, including Cooper. She reveals herself to be a disguised Mystique and kills Reisz. Shadow King quickly shifts to a new host, Legion. As X-Factor and the freed X-Men reach Polaris, Legion sets off an explosion that destroys much of the island.
Professor X lands on the island himself, but finds Legion holding all of his students captive. Legion is attacked unexpectedly by Storm, freeing the X-Men. He retreats and unleashes the X-Men and Muir Island inhabitants to take down his enemies. Professor X decides they must attack the Shadow King on both the physical and astral planes to defeat him, so he sends half the team to break the nexus formed with Polaris and the other half to protect his body while he is on the Astral Plane. He begins his battle with the Shadow King, but now the villain has become too powerful to attack. Jean Grey, finding the damage inflicted to Xavier on the Astral Plane affecting his actual body, brings herself and the accompanying X-Men onto the Plane to assist. In the physical world, Forge defeats the still-controlled Psylocke and uses her psychic knife on Polaris to disrupt and sever the nexus. His power source destroyed, the Shadow King is ripped apart.
In the aftermath, Professor X fails to repair the mental damage to Legion's mind, leaving Legion brain-dead, but is comforted by X-Factor's decision to rejoin the X-Men. Val Cooper, returned from Shadow King's control, recruits Polaris, Guido Carosella and Jamie Madrox into a new government-sponsored team to replace Freedom Force.
Impact.
The series had several lasting results for the X-Men family of characters.

Coracoacromial ligament

The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong triangular band, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. 
It is attached, by its apex, to the summit of the acromion just in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its broad base to the whole length of the lateral border of the coracoid process. 
This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms a vault for the protection of the head of the humerus. 
It is in relation, above, with the clavicle and under surface of the Deltoideus; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus, a bursa being interposed. 
Its lateral border is continuous with a dense lamina that passes beneath the Deltoideus upon the tendons of the Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus. 
The ligament is sometimes described as consisting of two marginal bands and a thinner intervening portion, the two bands being attached respectively to the apex and the base of the coracoid process, and joining together at the acromion. 
When the Pectoralis minor is inserted, as occasionally is the case, into the capsule of the shoulder-joint instead of into the coracoid process, it passes between these two bands, and the intervening portion of the ligament is then deficient.

Inviscid flow

An inviscid flow is the flow of an ideal fluid that is assumed to have no viscosity. In fluid dynamics there are problems that are easily solved by using the simplifying assumption of an inviscid flow.
The flow of fluids with low values of viscosity agree closely with inviscid flow everywhere except close to the fluid boundary where the boundary layer plays a significant role.
Reynolds number.
The assumption of inviscid flow is generally valid where viscous forces are small in comparison to the inertial forces. Such flow situations can be identified as flows with a Reynolds number much greater than one. The assumption that viscous forces are negligible can be used to simplify the Navier-Stokes solution to the Euler equations.
The Euler equation governing inviscid flow is:
which is admittedly Newton's second law applied on a flowing infinitesimal volume element. In the steady-state case, combined with the continuity equation of mass, this can be solved using potential flow theory.
Problems with the inviscid-flow model.
While throughout much of a flow-field the effect of viscosity may be very small, a number of factors make the assumption of negligible viscosity invalid in many cases. Viscosity cannot be neglected near fluid boundaries because of the presence of a boundary layer, which enhances the effect of even a small amount of viscosity. Turbulence is also observed in some high-Reynolds-number flows, and is a process through which energy is transferred to increasingly small scales of motion until it is dissipated by viscosity.

Rambler Tarpon

The Rambler Tarpon was a concept car, a sporty youth-oriented 2 plus 2 hardtop coupé developed in 1963 by American Motors Corporation (AMC). It served to foretell the fastback design elements of the larger Rambler Marlin that was introduced in 1965.
Design.
The Tarpon was an "aquatically-named" design study for a small rear-wheel drive two-door monocoque pillarless hardtop. Characteristic was its sleek sloping fastback roof that narrowed as it met the rear bumper. The Tarpon featured two large and deep taillights that flowed down from the shoulders of the rear fender. The show car was finished in red with a black roof accenting its clean shape from the windshield back to almost the rear bumper. The smooth roofline was unbroken by the almost horizontal rear window. In a 1991 book about collectible cars, automotive historian Richard M. Langworth described the Tarpon's sweeping roofline and "roughly elliptical side window openings suited the American's handsome lines to a T, and the pretty well-peoportioned fastback looked a natural for showroom sale." However, there was no trunk lid or outside hatch to access the cargo area. The Tarpon generated wide interest as it toured the auto show circuit starting in January 1964. It was well received at the Chicago Auto Show before the so-called "pony car" market segment was established. The Tarpon appeared together with the Mustang II (a concept design shown before the production version was unveiled) at the 1964 New York International Auto Show.
Development.
Early in 1963, American Motors' management began development of “a new car with a sports flair” to modify its image. Richard A. Teague's styling team came up with an entirely new concept for AMC - a fastback design. Teague knew that his design team had to work with considerably smaller budgets than their counterparts at Detroit's Big Three. The small automaker was not willing to undertake the large investment that would be required all-new tooling, so his design team made imaginative use of existing tooling and create spin-offs from existing products.
The Tarpon was made on the compact-sized Rambler American's new design and platform already set for the 1964 model year. A convertible chassis was used wheelbase), but the Tarpon was slightly longer, compared to for the production Rambler American. The Tarpon's roof was lowered two inches making it only high for an even more dynamic look. The top section of the new Rambler Tarpon was made of reinforced plastic. The windshield was described as "bulbous" and the fastback roofline featuring a "skylight" rear window. The swept back, double-compound curved windshield further enhanced the Tarpon's low appearance. The Tarpon also featured polished 13-inch aluminum wheels. Production Ramblers rode on ordinary steel 14-inch versions, so the smaller wheels made the car lower. The interior had a complete set of dial-type gauges under a padded dash, a deep-dish aluminum steering wheel rimmed in walnut, and custom bucket seats.
The Tarpon seemed to take aim at Plymouth's new Valiant-based Barracuda and the soon to be announced Ford Mustang. Shown before the introduction of Ford's compact Falcon-based Mustang, AMC's Tarpon was "an instant success" with 60 percent of surveyed potential buyers stating they would buy one.
The Tarpon did not go into production. At that time, AMC was still developing its "GEN-2" light-weight V8 engine that would fit the small Rambler American chassis. If produced, the Tarpon would have been a competitor to the Plymouth Barracuda, a fastback derivative of the second-generation compact Valiant. Utilizing an existing compact platform would have paralleled the Mustang's design approach whose chassis, suspension, and drive train were derived from the Ford Falcon. However, AMC's market research indicated that offering only a six-cylinder power plant would not satisfy the intended target market segment. The new V8 engine was introduced in 1966 in the sporty hardtop model of the Rambler American called Rogue. Moreover, AMC's CEO, Roy Abernethy, wanted the company to move away from the marketing image of Ramblers as being only small, economical, and conservative automobiles and designs. According to Abernethy AMC's "main problem was its image lag — the fact that too many people still thought of American Motors as the builder of plain jane compacts."
Under Abernethy's leadership, the company was introducing larger cars that had more options, prestige, and luxury. For example, the new convertibles and more upscale Ambassador potentially offered higher profits. Although the small four-passenger Tarpon anticipated a new market segment that later became known as the pony cars, the decision at AMC was to build its sporty fastback "image" model on the company's mid-sized or intermediate Classic platform. Teague recalled that "Abernethy had decided that instead of a 2+2 we would build a 3+3 sports-type car." The new production model, called Marlin, was introduced mid-year 1965 and it added more "sport" to AMC's car line-up. However, the Marlin had six-passenger capacity and was equipped with features as a personal luxury car like the Ford Thunderbird or Buick Riviera, rather than a competitor in the pony-car segment. Nevertheless, the production Marlin incorporated many of the design features that were the trademarks of the Tarpon show car. Because it was a much larger car, the Marlin had even more pronounced shoulders extending laterally behind the rear wheels than those on the Tarpon.
In 1965, three years before AMC's production pony car was unveiled, press reports described the compact-sized design as "Tarpon-like fastback" built on the Rambler American's platform. Although the Tarpon show car pointed the way, AMC waited until the 1968 model year to introduce a small fastback, the Javelin, that was aimed directly at the market segment created by Ford's Mustang.
Designers.
The automotive design team at AMC was headed by Richard A. Teague. Stuart Vance was Manager of Engineering and this included the body development, as well as the prototype shop. Others involved with the Tarpon were Teague's right hand man Fred Hudson (who later contributed to the Javelin), Vince Geraci (who contributed to final look of the Marlin), Chuck Mashigan (Advanced Studio manager), Robert Nixon, Jack Kenitz, Donald Stumpf, Neil Brown Jr., Bill St. Clair, Jim Pappas, as well as Jim Alexander (who designed the interior). Teague selected the names for both the Tarpon show car and the production Marlin.
Teague worked at AMC for 26 years. He was responsible for some of AMC's timelessly beautiful and advanced vehicles, as well as for some of the company's disappointments. After his retirement as Vice President at AMC, Teague described the development of the fastback design: 
Teague was also responsible for the design of AMC's compact Javelin, as well as the two-seat AMX. Both were ground breaking small fastback sport coupes with well proportioned and timeless lines.
Legacy.
The Tarpon served as the direct fastback design influence for the 1965-1967 AMC Marlin. Moreover, components of the original Tarpon design returned to a production car in 2004 in a fastback coupe with a distinctive design "that reminds more than one observer of the old Rambler Marlin." The principal appearance statements of the small two-seat Chrysler Crossfire include its "provocative boattail theme" in its fastback and rear end design. Automotive journalists noted the Crossfire's resemblance to the AMC Marlin featuring the Tarpon's rear-end. For example, Rob Rothwell wrote: ""My first glimpse of the rear lines of the Chrysler Crossfire instantly brought back memories of one of my favorite cars, the 1965 Rambler Marlin""

Adam of Melrose

Adam of Melrose (died 1222) was Abbot of Melrose and Bishop of Caithness, famously burned to death by the husbandmen of Caithness.
He rose to the position of Abbot in 1207, and on 5 August 1213, was elected to the bishopric of Caithness, then based at Halkirk. On 11 May 1214, he was consecrated by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St. Andrews, with Walter, Bishop of Glasgow, and "Bricius", Bishop of Moray assisting. Adam, along with Bishop Walter and Bishop "Bricius", visited Rome in 1218, to obtain absolution from Pope Honorius III for the sentence of excommunication imposed on King Alexander II and the whole Kingdom of Scotland.
When Adam returned to Caithness in 1219, he began to encounter problems from the inhabitants of his diocese. Bishop Adam had increased the episcopal "tax" imposed on the province's husbandmen, raising it from a span of butter from every twenty cows, to a span from every ten cows. On 11 September 1222, a group of husbandmen gathered at Halkirk to protest against the bishop's tax increase. After some initial discussions, the company grew angry and killed Serlo, Dean of Newbattle (near Dalkeith), the Bishop's friend and advisor. Adam attempted to offer terms, but the infuriated husbandmen forced the bishop to flee into his kitchen, and in the kitchen they burned him to death. Adam's body was interred in the church of Skinnet. In 1239, Adam's successor Gilbert de Moravia (otherwise known as Saint Gilbert of Dornoch) moved the body to the newly established Cathedral at Dornoch.

Rail transport in Queensland

The Queensland rail network, the first in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line, and now the second largest narrow gauge network in the world, consists of:
Passenger services are provided by:
The TransLink network consists of approximately 300 route km and 145 stations.
History.
Construction.
Construction of the Queensland rail network began in 1864 with the first section of the Main Line Railway from Ipswich to Grandchester being built. This was the first narrow gauge main line constructed in the world and is now the second largest narrow gauge railway network in the world.
Network extent.
At its maximum extent in 1932, the system totalled ~10,500 km of routes open for traffic.
In 1925 QR employed ~18,000 people, 713 locomotives, 930 passenger carriages, ~16,000 goods wagons, hauled ~5M tons of goods and ~30M passengers, and made a return on capital of 3.2% before depreciation.
Electrification.
Three significant electrification programs have been undertaken in Queensland which include the Brisbane suburban network, the Blackwater and Goonyella coal networks, and the Caboolture to Gladstone line.
Public float.
On 2 June 2009 the Queensland Government announced the 'Renewing Queensland Plan', with Queensland Rail's commercial activities to be separated from the Government's core passenger service responsibilities. The commercial activities were formed into a new company called QR National Limited. The new structure was announced by the State Government on 2 December 2009, and took place from 1 July 2010.
Infrastructure.
Track gauge.
The nascent Queensland Railways was persuaded that the way to reduce the cost of railway construction was to use a narrower gauge than the standard gauge of . A prototype existed in Norway, but 
Queensland became the first rail operator in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line. The proposed gauge railway involved a 5 ton axle load and very sharp curves of 5 chains (100 metres) on the long climb to Toowoomba at about above sea level. The maximum gradient was 1 in 50 (2%) uncompensated, which combined with a 100m radius curve gives an equivalent grade of 1 in 41 (~2.5%). Although the proposed railway could only manage a top speed of , that was claimed to be sufficient for a hundred years.
One of main advantages of a narrow gauge railway is that the earthworks required during construction do not have to be as extensive. It was estimated that the cost of this standard of railway would be 25% of the cost of a standard gauge line built to the minimum standard considered possible with that gauge at the time. As the colony of Queensland had a non-indigenous population of ~30,000 at the time the decision was made, it is understandable. Standard gauge branch lines were later constructed in NSW with 100m radius curves and had the same low maximum speed.
The choice of the non-standard gauge was and still is controversial, and the choice was approved very narrowly by parliament. Thus the die was cast for a large narrow-gauge system, which was copied by three other Australian states as well as a number of other countries. A hundred and fifty years later, Queensland is still sparsely populated (4.5 million in 2013), but many trains hauling coal are some of the longest and heaviest in the world, with Aurizon currently trialing coal trains of 25,000 tonne gross load that are ~4.5 km long.
Rack Railway.
QR had one rack railway, with grades as steep as 1 in 16.5 (6%), which was on the branch to Mount Morgan. It was bypassed by a conventional line in 1951 with grades of 1 in 50 (2%). The bypass closed in 1987. The rack system was the Abt rack system, the same type used by the Mount Lyell Railway in Tasmania.
Operators.
Historically the government owned Queensland Rail has been the main rail operator in Queensland.
The exception has been the standard gauge link from New South Wales into Brisbane. When opened in 1930 it was operationally a part of the New South Wales system and run by that government owned railway, under agreement with Queensland which owned the line. From 1994 National Rail took over the operation of virtually all standard gauge freight services to and from Brisbane, as part of a reorganisation of interstate freight in Australia.
It was not until 2002 that QR entered the standard gauge market through subsidiary Interail, by 2004 they were running freight services from Brisbane through to Melbourne. Today standard gauge freight services are operated by Pacific National after their acquisition of National Rail, and QR subsidiary QRNational.
On the narrow gauge Queensland Rail operates all passenger services and hauls the majority of non-coal freight. In 2005 the first non-QR narrow gauge commercial rail operation started in Queensland, with Pacific National Queensland (a subsidiary of Pacific National) commencing operation of container services between Brisbane and Cairns, followed in 2009 by their entry into the export coal market. Queensland Rail's subsidiary Australian Railroad Group have also entered the Queensland narrow gauge freight market, operating trains between Townsville and Mount Isa in their own right. Standard gauge passenger services are provided by the New South Wales Government's NSW TrainLink using their XPT.
Aurizon.
In 2010 the Queensland government privatised the narrow gauge freight haulage and all standard gauge components of Queensland National. In 2012 the organisation renamed itself Aurizon.
Airtrain.
The Brisbane Airport rail line, named Airtrain, officially opened to passengers in May 2001. Under a BOOT scheme - build, own, operate and transfer - the Queensland Government licensed Airtrain Citylink to build the rail line, to own and operate it, and hand the entire infrastructure over to the Queensland Government after 35 years when the company will then cease to exist. Airtrain Citylink contracted Transfield Services to build, operate and maintain the line and finally Airtrain Citylink contracted QR to provide rolling stock for the rail line.
Sugar tramways.
Queensland Railways sold a line in 1964 to the Gin Gin Cooperative Mill who converted it to a sugar tramway. A number of tramways of narrow gauge for the transport of sugar cane have operated in Queensland as private concerns, associated with the relevant sugar cane mill. These tramways are quite advanced technically, with hand-me-down rails cascaded from the normal rails, remote-controlled brake vans, concrete sleepers in places, and tamping machines in miniature. The twenty or so separate tramways cooperate in research and development, with a combined total of over 4,000 kilometers of track. These mills cover the area from Mossman in the north, to Nambour in the south. Some have been considering a passenger service.
Rollingstock.
Passenger.
TransLink.
For TransLink services as far as Gympie North, Queensland Rail's rolling stock is electric, air-conditioned, were constructed locally in Maryborough, and are no older than years:
All trains are electric multiple units with a driver cabin at both ends, with the exception of EM60 through to EM79 having a cab at one end. These units also have only 3 powered bogies (per 3 car set) compared to the 4 powered bogie arrangement for the remaining EMUs. All EMU, SMU and IMU units consist of three cars, giving a fleet total of 621 cars, plus the 20 ICE cars. The ICE sets are usually configured as four, five or six car trains.
Long distance services.
Long-distance services are operated by Traveltrain, a division of Queensland Rail. Traveltrain services mainly cater to a tourist market.
History.
Queensland's first Premier passenger service was the Sydney Mail, introduced in 1888 when the NSW line opened to Wallangarra. From 1923 it included a Parlour Car, which was transferred to the Townsville Mail in 1930 following the opening of the Standard Gauge line to Brisbane from Sydney.
In 1935 the Sunshine Express was introduced on the Brisbane - Cairns service, being the first completely roller-bearing equipped train in Australia.
The Inlander was the first train in Australia with air-conditioned sleeping cars.

Francis Beltrán

Francis LeBron Beltrán (born November 29, 1979) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles organization. He has previously played for the Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, and Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.
Career.
Chicago Cubs.
The Chicago Cubs signed Beltran as an undrafted free agent in 1996 and assigned him to the Arizona League Cubs, their rookie-level minor league affiliate. Beltran spent three seasons (1997–1999) with the Arizona team, with a combined record of 1–3, with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.99 in 35 appearances. Midway through the 1999 season, the Cubs promoted him to the Single-A Eugene Emeralds. There his ERA ballooned to 8.36, and the Cubs kept him in Eugene for the 2000 season. Beltran's ERA improved to 2.68, and the Cubs promoted him to the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts, where he went 1–1 with a 9.86 ERA. In 2001, the Cubs moved Beltran up to the Single-A Daytona Cubs, where he went 6–9 with an ERA of 5.00. In November of that year, the Cubs signaled their confidence in Beltran by adding him to their 40-man roster.
In 2002, the Cubs promoted Beltran to the Double-A West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx. Beltran got off to a good start; by the end of June he was 1–2 with 12 saves and an ERA of 3.42. On June 27, the Cubs called up Beltran to replace Jason Bere, who had gone on the disabled list with a contusion to his right knee. Beltran made his major league debut on June 28, 2002, in an interleague game against the crosstown rival Chicago White Sox. Beltran walked two over a third of an inning but, did not surrender a run. In a second appearance on July 1, Beltran gave up one run in of an inning while striking out one. The next day, the Cubs sent him back to West Tennessee to make room for reliever Tom Gordon. In August, the Cubs recalled Beltran as reliever Juan Cruz went on the disabled list. Beltran appeared in an additional nine games for the Cubs, with an overall ERA of 7.50.
The Cubs invited Beltran to spring training in 2003, but he started the year with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs; the first time he had played for that team. Beltran pitched the whole year at Iowa, going 6–2 with a 2.96 ERA. The Cubs briefly recalled him in June after David Kelton was sent down, but optioned him back to Iowa before he made an appearance. In July, there was talk that Beltran would be the player to be named later in a deal between the Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates in which the Cubs sent José Hernández and Matt Bruback to the Pirates in exchange for Kenny Lofton and Aramis Ramirez; in the end the Pirates took Bobby Hill. Beltran's season ended early because of biceps tendinitis, but during the off-season played in the Caribbean World Series and was named series MVP. The Cubs had him marked down as their future closer. Beltran began the year with Iowa after a "horrendous" spring training. After just a few appearances, however, the Cubs recalled him to replace Andy Pratt, who had struggled. Said manager Dusty Baker of Beltran: "was doing well down there [in Iowa, and we felt he deserved a chance."
Beltran made 35 appearances for the Cubs that year, posting a 2–2 record with a 4.36 ERA. He struck out 40 batters in 35 innings, but also gave up eight home runs, including a record-breaking 503-foot shot by Richie Sexson in Bank One Ballpark on April 26, 2004. On July 21, 2004, the Cubs sent Beltran back to Iowa and replaced him with Jon Leicester. A week later, he was traded to the Montreal Expos as part of a four-team deal which sent Nomar Garciaparra to the Cubs. The Expos optioned Beltran to the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers.
Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals.
At Edmonton, Beltran worked as a closer and saved five games with an ERA of 1.80. The Expos recalled Beltran in mid-August; he posted a 7.53 ERA over 11 appearances. Beltran pitched the final inning of the last game played by the Expos, an 8–1 loss to the New York Mets. Beltran remained with the Expos as they became the Washington Nationals, but sat out the entire 2005 season because of elbow surgery. He missed much of the 2006 season as well, making a combined 10 appearances with the Gulf Coast Nationals and New Orleans Zephyrs, and was released at the end of the year.
Baltimore Orioles.
In 2007, the Baltimore Orioles signed Beltran to a minor-league contract and sent him to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Beltran did not get the call and spent the entire year in Norfolk, going 2–9 with a 4.70 ERA and eight saves.
Detroit Tigers.
2008 found Beltran with the Detroit Tigers, who invited him to spring training. At the conclusion of spring training, Beltran went to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, but was called up almost immediately after the Tigers received word that injured reliever Fernando Rodney's return to the team would be delayed (Rodney would return in June). Beltran made five appearances for the Tigers, allowing five runs in 4 innings for an ERA of 5.79. The Tigers designated him for assignment, and after he cleared waivers returned him to Toledo. He was recalled by Detroit on August 13, but was designated for assignment on August 26, and was sent outright to the minors the following day. Detroit released him at the end of the 2008 season.
San Francisco Giants.
In December 2008, Beltrán signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. Beltran was released in April 2009 by the Giants.
Return to Baltimore.
On January 15, 2012, Beltran signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles.

Coracohumeral ligament

The coracohumeral ligament is a broad ligament which strengthens the upper part of the capsule of the shoulder joint.
It arises from the lateral border of the coracoid process, and passes obliquely downward and lateralward to the front of the greater tubercle of the humerus, blending with the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. 
This ligament is intimately united to the capsule by its posterior and lower border; but its anterior and upper border presents a free edge, which overlaps the capsule.

Léon Houa

Léon Houa (8 November 1867 – 31 January 1918) was a Belgian road bicycle racer famous for winning the first three editions of Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 1892–1894. The race has come to be known as "La Doyenne" ("the oldest woman"), and is one of the five 'Monuments' of the European professional road cycling calendar, and the oldest.
The first two editions of Liège–Bastogne–Liège were amateur races. On 29 May 1892, he bested 32 amateur riders over 250 km to finish the race in 10 hours, 48 minutes and 36 seconds and become the first Liège–Bastogne–Liège champion. On 28 May 1893, he finished in 10 hours, 40 minutes and ahead of 25 other riders. Also in 1893, Houa won the amateur version of the Belgium National Road Race Championship.
Houa went onto to win the first professional version of the race held in 1894 in 8 hours, 52 minutes and 5 seconds over a distance of 223 km. Also in 1894, Houa captured the elite men's version of the Belgium National Road Race Championship.

Johnny Tremain (film)

Johnny Tremain is a 1957 film made by Walt Disney Productions, based on the 1944 Newbery Medal-winning children's novel of the same name by Esther Forbes, retelling the story of the years in Boston, Massachusetts prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution. The movie was directed by Robert Stevenson. It was made for television, then ultimately released to theatres, and finally wound up on television a year after that, on the Walt Disney anthology television series. It was shown on television in two episodes rather than as a complete film on a single evening. The song "Liberty Tree", with music by George Bruns and Lyrics by Tom Blackburn, became familiar, when the song was placed on the Disney Record album entitled "Happy Birthday and Other Holiday songs".
Plot.
Johnny Tremain is apprenticed to a silversmith, Mr. Lapham. One day, wealthy Jonathan Lyte asks Mr. Lapham to fix a broken silver tea cup. Lapham refuses because he believes he is too old for such jobs. Tremain believes he is skilled enough to do the job, and accepts. After trying several times but failing, he asks fellow silversmith, Paul Revere, for help designing a new handle. Revere tells him to make the handle deeper and larger. Eager to try the new design, Johnny breaks the Sabbath and accidentally burns his hand. The damage is so severe that he will never have full use of the hand again, and cannot continue as a silversmith apprentice. No one will hire him with only one usable hand. The Sons of Liberty recruit him as a messenger, to secretly inform members of the times and locations of meetings. 
Johnny confides to Priscilla Lapham, Mr. Lapham's daughter, that he is secretly related to Mr. Lyte. He shows her a christening cup bearing the Lyte family crest as evidence. Desperate for money, he approaches Lyte and shows him the christening cup. Lyte assumes that Johnny stole the cup, and files charges against him. Josiah Quincy defends Johnny in court. Introducing Priscilla as a witness, Quincy proves Johnny's innocence. 
Afterward, Tremain and the Sons of Liberty become active in several notable events leading to the American Revolution, including the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's Ride, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. During the Boston Tea Party, Dr. Joseph Warren offers to restore Tremain's hand, allowing him to return to his profession.
Cast.
Walt Disney's daughter Sharon Mae Disney also had a small uncredited role as Dorcas, a young friend of Johnny and Priscilla (who in the novel was one of Priscilla's sisters).
Educational films.
Portions of "Johnny Tremain" were used in 1968 for educational purposes. Two distinct sequences of the films were re-issued under the titles "The Boston Tea Party " and "The Shot Heard ‘Round the World". Both were originally shown on Disney´s anthology TV series in 1958.
Legacy.
After the movie was released, Walt Disney intended to build Liberty Street in Disneyland as an annex to Main Street USA. However, the project never materialized. After Walt's death, the concept was revived and turned into the much more expansive Liberty Square in Walt Disney World, which opened on October 1, 1971.
An elm tree found on the Disney property (originally six miles from the Magic Kingdom) was transplanted by Disney engineers and now serves as the square's Liberty Tree. Adorning it are 13 lanterns, representing the original 13 American colonies.
Louis Marx and Company released an American War of Independence playset featuring character figures of the actors in the show as a film tie-in.

Glenohumeral ligaments

In human anatomy, the glenohumeral ligaments (GHL) are three ligaments on the anterior side of the glenohumeral joint (i.e. between the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the head of the humerus; colloquially called the shoulder joint). Reinforcing the anterior glenohumeral joint capsule, the superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligaments play different roles in the stability of the head of the humerus depending on arm position and degree of rotation.
Location.
The ligaments may be best seen by opening the capsule at the back of the joint and removing the head of the humerus:
In addition to these, the capsule is strengthened in front by two bands derived from the tendons of the Pectoralis major and Teres major respectively.
Function.
During abduction of the arm the middle and inferior ligaments become taut while the superior ligament relaxes. The radius of curvature of the head of the humerus is greater superiorly than inferiorly, which further stretches these ligaments so that they keep the articular surfaces of the joint in their close-packed position.
During abduction the greater tubercle of the humerus comes in contact with the upper margin of the glenoid cavity, which limits maximum abduction. By rotating the humerus laterally, this contact is delayed because the greater tubercle is pulled back so that the bicipital groove faces the coracoacromial ligament. This slightly slackens the inferior fibres of the glenohumeral ligament, allowing an abduction of 90°. Combining abduction with 30° flexion in the plane of the scapula causes a delay in the tightening of the ligament resulting in a maximum abduction of 110°.
During rotation of the arm lateral rotation stretches all three ligaments while medial rotation relaxes them.

Ahmad Ibrahim Al-Thawadi () was the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Tribune, a leftist political party in the Kingdom of Bahrain. He was born in 1938 during the British colonization of Bahrain. He was also a founding member of the National Liberation Front. He used the nom de guerre 'Saif bin Ali' ().
He was one of the first victims of the State Security Law (Anti-human rights law that was cancelled in the democratic era of the kingdom). Many Bahrainis believe Dhawadi enriched the political movement in Bahrain even when he was in exile in Asian and African countries and later in Latin America.
In the eighties, he married Bahraini poet Hamda Khamees and had a daughter Reem and a son Qais.
With the advent of Bahrain's political reforms and King Hamad Bin Eisa Al Khalifa's call for Bahraini politicians to come back from exile, Dhawadi came to Bahrain in 2001 to start a new era of political activities in a democratic country.
Dhawadi supported the reforms and fought those who were against democratic projects. Dhawadi's lifelong sufferings in prisons and exile were aimed at fulfilling his dream for a better future for the younger generations.
In 1994, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and in the last years of his life he underwent many operations, but the illness got the better of the fighter. He died on July 8, 2006, after a ten-year battle with colon cancer.

Glenoid labrum

The glenoid labrum (glenoid ligament) is a fibrocartilaginous rim attached around the margin of the glenoid cavity in the shoulder blade. The shoulder joint is considered a 'ball and socket' joint. However, in bony terms the 'socket' (the glenoid fossa of the scapula) is quite shallow and small, covering at most only a third of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). The socket is deepened by the glenoidal labrum. 
The labrum is triangular in section, the base is fixed to the circumference of the cavity, while the free edge is thin and sharp. 
It is continuous above with the tendon of the long head of the Biceps brachii, which gives off two fasciculi to blend with the fibrous tissue of the labrum. 
It deepens the articular cavity, and protects the edges of the bone.
Clinical significance.
Injury.
Tearing of the labrum can occur from either acute trauma or repetitive shoulder motion such as in the sports of swimming and baseball. Acute trauma may be from dislocation of the shoulder, falling on an outstretched arm, direct blows to the shoulder, and other accidents of the sort. Tears are classified as either superior or inferior in regards to where the tear is in the glenoid cavity. A SLAP (superior labrum, anterior to posterior) lesion is a tear where the glenoid labrum meets the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle. Symptoms include increased pain with overhead activity, popping or grinding, loss of strength, and trouble localizing a specific point of pain. Because a SLAP lesion involves the biceps, pain and weakness may also be felt when performing elbow flexion with resistance.

R v Adams (1957)

R v Adams Crim LR 365 is an English case that allows a doctor to hasten death (as a secondary intention) using analgesic medications such as heroin and morphine.
Case Facts.
The defendant, John Bodkin Adams, was a doctor who was charged with murder by "easing the passing" of elderly patients by giving drugs calculated to hasten their deaths (one had left a bequest - including a Rolls-Royce - to him in her will).
Judgment.
It was said that a doctor has no special defence, but "he is entitled to do all that is proper and necessary to relieve pain even if the measures he takes may incidentally shorten life" (i.e. as a secondary intention). 
On these grounds, the defendant was acquitted.
This case was the first to formulate a "double effect" in respect of the "mens rea" of murder. Liability for murder can be avoided if medicine which is beneficial to the patient is given, despite the knowledge that death will occur as a side effect.

CHCO-TV

CHCO-TV is a Canadian television station, broadcasting in St. Andrews, New Brunswick and serving the Charlotte County area.
History.
CHCO-TV launched on March 13, 1993 on Fundy Cable in St. Andrews as the local community access channel. The station subsequently applied for a broadcast license in 2005, which was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 23, 2005, and began operation on UHF channel 26 on November 1, 2006 as CHCT-TV.
Charlotte County did not receive digital cable until August 2010 when community television from Saint John became available on cable 10.
August 18, 2010 CHCT-TV was moved from cable channel 10 to channel 9, launching a new on-air image as "Truly Local Television".
On July 28, 2012 CHCT-TV's call sign was changed to CHCO-TV.
Today.
Although distributed on cable 9, CHCO-TV is the first community LPTV station in New Brunswick to operate independently from the cable television provider. It is also the only locally owned and operated television station in the Province of New Brunswick. CHCO-TV broadcasts local events, town council meetings, local sports, and produces such programs as Fundy Tidings, Unwound, County Connections, The Etiquette Guy, Charlotte County Artisans, Sunbury Shores: This Week, and On Stage.
With the advent of digital technology came the loss for community television stations in the neighboring communities of St. Stephen and St. George. Long time volunteer-operated channels in those communities were replaced in August 2010 by the cable operator's distant community channel in Saint John some 100 kilometers away. Even though these communities receive cable service originating from St. Andrews, CHCO-TV is blocked out by the cable operator by duplicating Provincial Legislature service onto cable 9.
On December 20, 2012, CHCO-TV was added to the Bell-TV satellite television service on channel 539.

Langdon Elwyn Mitchell

Langdon Elwyn Mitchell (February 17, 1862–October 21, 1935) was an American playwright popular on Broadway in the early twentieth century. He was the son of a noted writer and neurologist, S. Weir Mitchell (inventor of the "rest cure"), and the grandson of writer and physician John Kearsley Mitchell. Born in Philadelphia, he studied in Dresden and Paris, attended the Harvard and Columbia law schools, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1886. A member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, he wrote plays under his own name and poetry under the pen name "John Philip Varley." 
Along with Clyde Fitch, William Vaughan Moody, Percy MacKaye, Ned Sheldon, and Rachel Crothers, Langdon Mitchell was regarded as one of the more serious American dramatists in an era (c. 1900-1910) not notable for weighty plays. He was considered a solid craftsman whose plays provided good parts for talented actors and actresses.
Mitchell enjoyed an especially productive relationship with one of the most prominent actresses of his time, Mrs. Minnie Fiske, who was one of the first actresses to play Nora in Ibsen's "A Doll's House" on the New York stage and was renowned for her Hedda Gabler. Mrs. Fiske acted one of her most lauded roles, the conniving Becky Sharp, in 1899 in Mitchell's dramatization of Thackeray's "Vanity Fair," and she starred seven years later in his most famous work, "The New York Idea," a play which had been written for her. ("The New York Idea" is the only play by Mitchell to have survived his era and is occasionally performed in regional theaters. It was revived off-Broadway in New York in 1977, in a production starring Blythe Danner, and again in 2011, in an adaptation by David Auburn, the author of "Proof.") 
Theater critic and historian Brooks Atkinson wrote in 1970 of "The New York Idea," a tart comedy about divorce, that "the dialogue is still lively and the idiocies of the character are still pertinent," securely placing it in the long tradition of drawing-room comedy. Some reviewers at the time sanctimoniously took issue with the idea of a comedy about a socially questionable topic such as divorce, but others praised Mitchell for writing in the spirit of British playwrights Arthur Wing Pinero and Henry Arthur Jones.
Mitchell taught playwriting at the University of Pennsylvania from 1928 to 1930.

Since 1993 it toured New Zealand, Tonga, Taiwan, New Caledonia, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Malta, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Japan, Estonia, Finland, Russia, the People's Republic of China, Spain, Hong Kong and Macau.
The members of the orchestra were aged from 12 to 25 and came from a variety of cultural backgrounds. They worked with many international artists, including Giuseppe Giglio (Italy), Roman Rudnytsky (USA), Jansyk Kakhidze (Georgia), Christina Ortiz (England), Dimka Ashkenazy (England), and Liam O'Flynn (Ireland). The Australian artists they performed with include Horst Hoffmann, Myer Fredman, Kathryn Selby, Donald Hazelwood, Marilyn Meier, Dene Olding, Don Burrows, James Morrison, Geoffrey Collins, Nicole Youl, Elizabeth Whitehouse, Rosario La Spina, Judy Bailey, Chris Shepard, Stephen Mould and Simon Tedeschi.
In November 2013, the Board announced the disbanding of the orchestra, and the endowment of a position in the Fellowship Program, one of the main education programs of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, in perpetual remembrance of Matthew Krel. The orchestra's final performance was on 1 December 2013, at the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre in Penrith, New South Wales.

Royal Cork Yacht Club

The Royal Cork Yacht Club is the world's oldest yacht club founded in 1720, although this record is contested by the Neva Yacht Club.
Formation and claim to be the world's first yacht club.
The predecessor of the present day "Royal Cork Yacht Club", was the "Water Club of the Cork Harbour", established in 1720 by William O'Brien, 4th Earl and the 9th Baron of Inchiquin, a great-grandson to the 1st Earl of Inchiquin, who was a courtier of King Charles II.
The Royal Cork Yacht Club is widely acknowledged as the oldest yacht club in the world.
Names & Locations.
On returning to England from exile, King Charles developed an interest in sailing on the Thames and subsequently his courtiers (including The Earl of Inchiquin) followed his example. Upon the Earl’s return to Cork, recreational sailing commenced. Some years later, the Earl of Inchiquin's great-grandson, 26 year old William O'Brien and five of his friends formalised their activities and in so doing established The Water Club of the Harbour of Cork in 1720.
This body became inactive in 1765 and was re-established in 1802. In 1872 the Munster Model Yacht Club was founded as a Corinthian Yacht Club to provide for amateur racing rather than racing for wagers on yachts of wealthy owners with paid hands. It changed its name and dropped the word "Model" and became known as the Cork Harbour Yacht Club. Later on that decade it dropped "Harbour" and became the Cork Yacht Club and in 1831, the club received a royal charter from King William IV, and became the Royal Cork Yacht Club. In 1966 the Royal Munster Yacht Club merged with it to become as it is known today, the Royal Cork Yacht Club incorporating The Royal Munster Yacht Club
It was originally located on Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour. In the early nineteenth century, it transferred to Cove, subsequently named Queenstown, now Cobh. It is currently located in Crosshaven, near Cork City.
By the mid 19th century membership was keenly sought after, due to the club's popularity, and club records show that many candidates were disappointed at not getting membership. One who was admitted was Prince Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, later to be Emperor of Mexico. Prince Ferdinand was the founder of the Imperial Austrian Navy and a brother of Emperor Franz Joseph. The Prince of Wales who was later to become King Edward VII attended several RCYC regattas sailing his famous yacht "Britannia". 
In 1872 the Munster Model Yacht Club was founded and eventually received a royal charter to become the Royal Munster Yacht Club. It settled in the Clubhouse of the Cork Harbour Motor Yacht Club at Crosshaven in the 1930s. The Royal Munster merged with the Royal Cork Yacht Club in 1966.
Regattas.
Cork Week is hosted by the Royal Cork Yacht Club and is held every two years, usually in late June or early July. It is Ireland's largest and most prestigious sailing regatta.
The Royal Cork Yacht club also hosts many regional, national, and international sailing events.

According to the NBA, 44 players, 39 collegiate players and five international players, filed as early-entry candidates for the 2008 NBA Draft. These numbers do not include players who are automatically eligible for the draft. The Chicago Bulls, who had a 1.7 percent probability of obtaining the first selection, won the NBA Draft Lottery on May 22. The Bulls' winning of the lottery was the second-largest upset in NBA Draft Lottery history behind the Orlando Magic, who won it in 1993 with just a 1.5% chance. The Miami Heat and the Minnesota Timberwolves obtained the second and third picks respectively.
For the first time in draft history the first three draft picks were all freshmen. The Chicago Bulls used the first overall pick to draft Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis, who later went on to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, making him the first player to be drafted first overall and to win Rookie of the Year since LeBron James in 2003. The Miami Heat used the second pick to draft Michael Beasley from Kansas State University, and the Minnesota Timberwolves used the third pick to draft O. J. Mayo from University of Southern California. With five players taken in the draft, the University of Kansas tied University of Connecticut (2006) and University of Florida (2007) for the record with the most players selected in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Another record was set when twelve freshmen were drafted, ten of whom were drafted in the first round. Of the players drafted, 29 are forwards, 19 are guards, and 12 are centers.
The 2008 NBA Draft was the final time that the Seattle SuperSonics made an NBA Draft appearance, as well as the final time that the Sonics appeared in official media publications. In early July, the franchise relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and was renamed to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder made its first NBA Draft appearance in 2009. This draft also marked the first time that an NBA D-League player was drafted.
Draft Lottery.
The first 14 picks in the draft belonged to teams that had missed the playoffs; the order was determined through a lottery. The lottery determined the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. As it is commonplace in the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 18, 2008.
The lottery was held on May 20, 2008, in Secaucus, New Jersey. The Chicago Bulls, who had the ninth-worst record, won the lottery with just a 1.7% chance to win. The Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves, with the worst and third-worst records, respectively, won the second and third picks.
Below were the chances for each team to get specific picks in the 2008 draft lottery, rounded to three decimal places:
Trades involving draft picks.
Draft-day trades.
The following trades involving drafted players were made on the day of the draft.
Pre-draft trades.

2009 NBA draft

The 2009 NBA draft was held on June 25, 2009, the WaMu Theatre at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players.
The Los Angeles Clippers, who won the draft lottery on May 19, 2009, used their first overall draft pick to draft Blake Griffin from University of Oklahoma. However, he missed the entire 2009–10 season due to surgery on his broken left kneecap, which he injured during the pre-season. Tanzanian-born Hasheem Thabeet from University of Connecticut was drafted second overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Thabeet became the first player born in Tanzania to be drafted by an NBA team. James Harden was drafted 3rd overall in the 2009 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. This made him the first player to be drafted by the franchise as the Oklahoma City Thunder whose franchise moved from Seattle to OKC in 2008. The Sacramento Kings drafted Tyreke Evans fourth overall and was named 2009–10 NBA Rookie of the Year, after he became the fourth NBA player in history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in his rookie season, joining the elite club of Oscar Robertson (1960), Michael Jordan (1984) and LeBron James (2003). Spanish teenager Ricky Rubio was drafted fifth overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Rubio became the fifth highest international player who never played U.S. college basketball to be drafted in the NBA, tied with Nikoloz Tskitishvili (5th in 2002), and behind Yao Ming (1st in 2002), Andrea Bargnani (1st in 2006), Darko Miličić (2nd in 2003) and Pau Gasol (3rd in 2001). 23rd pick Omri Casspi became the first Israeli player to be drafted in the first round, and later he became the first Israeli to play in the NBA.
The 2009 Draft marked the first time three sons of former NBA players were selected in the top 15 picks of the draft. Stephen Curry, son of Dell Curry, was drafted 7th overall by the Golden State Warriors. Gerald Henderson, Jr., son of Gerald Henderson, was drafted 12th overall by the Charlotte Bobcats. Austin Daye, son of Darren Daye, was drafted 15th overall by the Detroit Pistons. The draft also marked the first time a former high school player who skipped college to play professional basketball in Europe was selected in an NBA draft. Brandon Jennings, who skipped college to play professional basketball with Italian team Lottomatica Roma, was drafted 10th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the draft.
Of the 60 players drafted, four were freshmen, nine were sophomores, 12 were juniors, 22 were seniors, and 13 were international players without U.S. college basketball experience. The University of North Carolina's Tar Heels had the most players selected in the draft; three players were selected in the first round and one was selected in the second round. This marked the second time ever that four Tar Heels players were selected in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. The Minnesota Timberwolves had the league-high four first-round draft picks and the first time in team history that the team held two top-10 draft picks. The Timberwolves also had two second-round draft picks and became the team with the most draft picks in the 2009 draft with a total of six draft picks. The Houston Rockets and the Orlando Magic were the only NBA teams who did not have a draft pick this year, although Houston acquired three drafted players' rights after the draft.
Eligibility.
The basic requirements for draft eligibility are:
The CBA defines "international players" as players who permanently resided outside the U.S. for three years prior to the draft, did not complete high school in the U.S., and have never enrolled at a U.S. college or university.
The basic requirement for automatic eligibility for a U.S. player is the completion of his college eligibility. Players who meet the CBA definition of "international players" are automatically eligible if their 22nd birthday falls during or before the calendar year of the draft (i.e., born on or before December 31, 1987). U.S. players who were at least one year removed from their high school graduation and have played professional basketball with a team outside the NBA were also automatically eligible. Former high school player Brandon Jennings meets these criteria, having graduated high school in 2008, skipped college basketball and then played professional basketball in Italy.
A player who is not automatically eligible must declare his eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2009 draft, this date fell on April 26. An early entry candidate is allowed to withdraw his eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 10 days before the draft. This year, a total of 74 collegiate players and 29 international players declared as early entry candidates. At the withdrawal deadline, 55 early entry candidates withdrew from the draft, leaving 39 collegiate players and 10 international players as the early entry candidates for the draft.
A player who has hired an agent will forfeit his remaining college eligibility, regardless of whether he is drafted. Also, while the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and its players' union allows a player to withdraw from the draft twice, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) mandates that a player who has declared twice loses his college eligibility. This second provision affected Chase Budinger, Wayne Ellington, and Ty Lawson, all of whom declared for and withdrew from the 2008 draft.
Draft lottery.
The lottery selection to determine the order of the top fourteen picks in the 2009 draft occurred on May 19, 2009. The Los Angeles Clippers won the first pick, while the Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder moved up to second and third picks respectively. The Sacramento Kings and Washington Wizards, who had the two best chances to land a top-three pick, fell down to the fourth and fifth spots, the lowest possible picks they could be awarded through the lottery. The remaining first-round picks and all the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss records in the previous season. As is commonplace in the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 17, 2009.
Below were the chances for each team to get specific picks in the 2009 draft lottery, rounded to three decimal places:
Trades involving draft picks.
Pre-draft trades.
Prior to the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams.
Draft-day trades.
The following trades involving drafted players were made on the day of the draft.
Notable undrafted players.
These players were not selected in the 2009 NBA draft but have played at least one game in the NBA.

<doc id="5877683" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877683" title="Edison's Conquest of Mars">
Edison's Conquest of Mars

"Edison's Conquest of Mars" is an 1898 science fiction novel by American astronomer and writer Garrett P. Serviss. It was written as a sequel to "Fighters from Mars", an unauthorized and heavily altered version of H. G. Wells's "The War of the Worlds". It has a place in the history of science fiction for its early employment of themes and motifs that later became staples of the genre.
The book features Thomas Edison as the primary character, though neither Edison nor H. G. Wells were involved in its creation. Set after the devastating Martian attack in the previous story, the novel depicts Edison leading a group of scientists to develop ships and weapons, including a disintegration ray, for the defence of Earth. Edison and company fight the aliens in space and on Mars, eventually causing a flood that defeats the enemy and forces an end to hostilities. Serviss wrote himself into the story as a professor whom Edison consults; also appearing are scientists such as Edward Emerson Barnard, Lord Kelvin, Wilhelm Röntgen, and Silvanus P. Thompson, and heads of state such as Queen Victoria, U.S. President William McKinley, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Emperor Mutsuhito.
Serviss' first attempt at fiction, the book was published serially in the "New York Journal". Serviss went on to write other science fiction stories, arguably making him the first American to write science fiction professionally. An early example of what would later be called space opera, "Edison's Conquest of Mars" was also a particularly literal "Edisonade". The book contains some notable "firsts" in science fiction: alien abductions, spacesuits (called "air-tight suits": see Spacesuits in fiction), aliens building the Pyramids, space battles, oxygen pills, asteroid mining and disintegrator rays.
Plot.
The book is set following the abortive Martian attack depicted in "Fighters from Mars", much more devastating and global than in H. G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds", though in both works the onslaught is thwarted when the aliens die from bacterial illness. Determining that the Martians will inevitably return, Earth's leaders, including U.S. President William McKinley, Queen Victoria, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Emperor Mutsuhito, unite the world against the common threat and plan an attack on Mars. American inventor Thomas Edison leads a group of scientists studying derelict Martian equipment; they are able to develop an anti-gravity device powered by electric repulsion as well as a disintegration ray.
Using this new technology, the allies construct an armada of space ships for the attack. Edison takes some ships to the moon on a test run; using the first known fictional depiction of space suits, the explorers uncover evidence of an extinct civilization of giants. The armada heads on, discovering a solid gold asteroid being mined by the Martians. The humans fight two space battles against the Martians, suffering heavy casualties but ultimately winning thanks to the superiority of Edison's ray gun compared to the Martians' electric weapons. The humans take a captive, from whom they learn the Martian language.
The humans reach Mars, but in spite of their superior forces they have lost half their men to the Martians' overwhelming numbers. The Martians envelop the planet in a smoke screen, and the humans retreat to the moon Deimos. During a raid on Mars for supplies, the earth men find Aina, the last of a population of human slaves whose ancestors were captured from Kashmir in a Martian raid 9,000 years before. During this raid, the Martians also constructed the Great Pyramids and the Great Sphynx in Egypt, the latter of which is a statue of their leader. Aina advises Edison that meeting the Martians in battle would be fruitless, and that they should instead attack the dams that channel water from the polar ice. Since most of Mars' cities are under sea level, the flood spreads rapidly, killing most Martians and destroying their civilization. Edison and company force a peace with the Martians, and return home to great celebration.
Aliens.
There are three type of aliens in the book.
The Martians in this version are not like the squid-like Martians described in H.G. Wells's story. These Martians are more humanoid with arms, legs and an enormous head with projector-like eyes and bad looking faces. When they rise, they are 15 feet high (4.572 meters). However this is only the male, for the species exhibits sexual dimorphism. To Earthlings, they appear unpleasant. The Martian women, however, are graceful and beautiful.
The residents of Ceres are at war with the Martians. However, they are only mentioned, except for a female slave who is 40 feet tall. The 'Cerenites' are this height due to the reduced gravity of their world.
When Edison's men land on the Moon, they discover that the Moon was, at one point, capable of supporting life. Only a giant footprint is seen, leaving the reader (and the characters) wondering what was once there.
Book.
Written in first person from the viewpoint of an unspecified character, the book has a slow pace, with little action, and is far more focused on details. The beginning of the book focuses on how all the inhabitants of Earth unite against a common foe (the martians).
Rich with technical details, at the same time trying to keep it understandable, there are some few action events through the story. The book was richly illustrated compared to many books of the time. This was due to it being written as a series of episodes, each one for a newspaper article, often leaving the characters on a cliffhanger, trying to get the reader back for each new chapter.
The world decided to go attack the Martian before they attack us. Without debate or explanation the story places America as the natural leader for this operation. The monarchs and public figures of the time are described, though presidents are not named but simply added as "president of...". Kaiser Wilhelm II is mentioned several times and is used as comic relief in the book. Queen Victoria is described as a sensible leader. The other monarchs are simply mentioned.
The Martians are described as very smart; however, they are not much more than arrogant cynical humans. In H.G. Wells's "The War of the Worlds" the Martians are distinctly non-human, and their invasion is due to survival; the humans are no more than animals to them. However the Martians in this book are more humanlike, just thinking a bit faster.

One in a Million (Malaysian TV series)

One in a Million (often abbreviated OIAM) is a Malaysian reality-competition show. It is the first reality singing competition to offer a RM 1 million prize to the winner. The show began airing on 8TV, a terrestrial television station in Malaysia, on May 26, 2006.
"One in a Million" seeks to discover the best young singer in the country through several auditions held nationwide. The objective of awarding a large amount of prize money is to provide the winner with quality production and marketing resources. In the later stages of the competition the progress of the contestants is determined by public voting by phone or text messaging. This is also the first reality singing competition that allows viewers to vote in as well as vote out the contestants.
The show features two judges who critique the contestants' performances in order to facilitate the voting: former singer and music lecturer Syafinaz Selamat and brand manager for 8TV, Paul Moss. The show is hosted by Awal Ashaari and Marion Caunter.
Regulations.
"One in a Million" is open to all Malaysian residents aged 16 to 32 during the taping of the program. A unique feature of the show is that recording artistes, established or otherwise, can take part in this contest, as displayed by popular singers Dayang Nurfaizah and Siti Sarah Raisuddin.
To be eligible, contestants must not be permanent and/or contract employees of the television station 8TV or its sister stations under Media Prima Berhad. Contestants must also not be representatives, employees, servants and/or agents of advertising or promotion service providers of 8TV, and their immediate family member.
Format.
Auditions.
The producers of the show hold open public auditions at locations across the country, where anyone who is eligible can attend. Hopefuls audition before the judges at several venues across the country.
A selection of the auditions in front of the judges – usually the best, the worst and the most bizarre – are broadcast over the first few weeks of the show. Each contestant enters the audition room, often after waiting for hours, and delivers either an "a cappella" or accompanied by their own guitar or keyboard instrument. If at least one of the two judges say "yes", then the contestant goes through to the next filter, otherwise the contestant is sent home. Filtering the auditions hopefuls before the next round varies by season.
Central Elimination and Knock-out.
Contestants who passed the auditions are split into groups in the Central Elimination. Contestants are asked to perform in front of the judges again and are narrowed down to forty.
The Top 40 contestants are put through the 'Blind Test' and 'Style/Presentation' Test. In the 'Blind Test', the contestants had to perform behind a screen. In the 'Style/Presentation' round, two guest judges judge the style and presentation of each contestant.
The 20 contestants who moved forward are ranked according to their performances. The contestants ranked Top 10 must then pick an opposing contestant from the Bottom 10 to compete against. Out of these 10 pairs, only one contestant from each pair may move on as decided by the judges.
Finals.
The finals last ten weeks during which each of the Final 12 contestants perform one song each week. The format changes with contestants singing two songs each week when there are only four contestants remaining. After each contestant has performed, the judges comment on their performance, usually focusing on vocal ability and stage presence. Once all the contestants have appeared, the voting lines open at the end of the show and the viewers vote to keep singers on the show or off. The judges, from this point on, serve almost entirely in an advisory capacity, with no direct influence on the results.
The results are only announced a week later on the following episode before the performances.
The winner receives a RM 1 million record deal with the record label Monkey Bone and will be managed by a management unit called The 8 Unit.
Cast.
Hosts.
Awal Ashaari.
Awal has hosted several TV programs and has appeared in several drama series and movies. Prior to hosting One in a Million Awal had made it to the Top 30 on the first season of Malaysian Idol.
One in a Million Diary.
A spin-off titled One in a Million Diary debuted after the Top 8 show during the first season. It aired on Wednesdays at 9.30p.m. and featured off-stage video clips as well as exclusive weekly interviews with the contestants.

3 Strikes (film)

3 Strikes is a 2000 American screwball comedy film, written and directed by DJ Pooh. The film stars Brian Hooks as Rob Douglas, a man just released from a one-year sentence in jail, who already has two strikes to his name. Since he is living under California's Three strikes law, Rob decides to go straight and leave the street life alone. However, things go horribly wrong for him as he gets involved in an altercation with the police upon the day of his release. The plot centers on Rob trying to evade the police until he can prove his innocence, for fear that he will be put away for good with a third strike. David Alan Grier, Faizon Love, and N'Bushe Wright co-star.
Plot.
Robert "Rob" Douglas is in prison. According to a local news report there has been a law- California's three strikes law, which will put three time offenders in prison for a minimum of twenty-five years. Rob is currently finishing his second bid in prison. It is his last day in jail.
Rob calls his friend Tone to pick him up from jail but Tone gets caught up with a woman he just met and asks J.J. to pick up Rob. Rob is picked up by J.J. and just as Rob tells him he never plans to go back to prison, cops pull the two over and J.J. shoots the cops. J.J. tells Rob that the car was stolen and Rob trying to elude his third strike escapes from the scene and hides at his girlfriend, Juanita’s house. J.J. is wounded and detained by the police.
Rob learns that the police is still searching for him and that he is on the most wanted list.
Detective Jenkins is investigating the case and searching for Rob.
J.J. is restricted to a hospital bed due to his injuries. He calls his friend Blue, and tells him that when the police come and question him about the shootout, he is going to put the blame on Rob. Soon after, J.J is raped (off-screen) by a homosexual janitor who had been lusting after his buttocks, which was where he had been wounded.
Rob runs into his old friend Mike who helps him with some money. Rob and Juanita meet at a hotel while Detective Jenkins stops at Rob's home to try to find him that night.
The next morning, Rob’s mother tells him the police have been looking for him, and some girl named Dahlia called saying she had some information that could keep him out of jail. Dahlia tells Rob to come to her place for a tape that could get him out of the situation he's in.
Rob asks Mike to get him a good lawyer and leaves for Dahlia’s home. Dahlia tells Rob that she will give him the taped conversation between J.J. and Blue (her brother) about the shootout if she can have her way with him, much to his disgust.
Blue tells Tone that Rob is at his house and Tone and his crew go to get him. The cops land up there as well. After a chase, Rob gives himself up at a church where Mike has brought a Lawyer.
Sometime later, in the final verdict, though Rob does not receive his third strike, he is sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating his parole.

Gustav Schwalbe

Gustav SchwalbeGustav Albert Schwalbe, M.D. (August 1, 1844 – April 23, 1916) was a German anatomist and anthropologist from Quedlinburg.
He was educated at the universities of Berlin, Zurich, and Bonn (M.D. 1866), he became in 1870 privat-docent at the University of Halle, in 1871 privatdozent and prosector at the University of Freiburg in Baden, in 1872 assistant professor at the University of Leipzig, and then professor of anatomy successively at the universities of Jena (1873), Königsberg (1881), and Strassburg (1883) - at that time a German university, Alsace having been annexed to Germany. There he died.
Known for his anthropological research of primitive man, Schwalbe considered the Neanderthal to be a direct ancestor of modern humans. He was the author of an influential treatise on Java Man, being a recent discovery by Eugène Dubois (1858-1940).
In 1869 Schwalbe injected Berlin-blue dye into the subarachnoid space of a dog, and was the first to demonstrate that the major pathways to absorb cerebrospinal fluid were lymphatic pathways. The subarachnoid or subdural spaces between the internal and external sheaths of the optic nerve are now referred to as "Schwalbe's spaces"; also called the intervaginal spaces of optic nerve ("spatia intervaginalia nervi optici"). His name is lent to several other anatomical structures, including "Schwalbe's nucleus" or the vestibular nucleus; "Schwalbe's ring", which is a circular ridge consisting of collagenous fibers surrounding the outer margin of Descemet's membrane; and "Schwalbe's line", an anatomical line located on the posterior surface of the eye's cornea.

<doc id="5877730" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877730" title="Coon Creek Formation">
Coon Creek Formation

The Coon Creek Formation is a geologic formation located in western Tennessee and extreme northeast Mississippi. It is a sedimentary sandy marl deposit, Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) in age, about 70 million years old. The formation is known for producing mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, particularly at Coon Creek in McNairy County, Tennessee, which the formation is named for. Additionally, the formation produces many other marine invertebrates such as "Turritella" and the state fossil of Tennessee, the bivalve "Pterotrigonia thoracica", as well as other fossils such as crabs.
Beginnings.
The story of Coon Creek began near the end of the Cretaceous Period, around 71 million years ago. At that time western Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, western Kentucky, and southeast Missouri were submerged beneath the Mississippi Embayment, a bay of the Gulf of Mexico. Coon Creek was formed in shallow coastal water probably less than 100 feet deep (Russell and Parks 1975). The sea floor was heavily populated with shellfish, crabs, and lobsters. Huge plesiosaurs, marine crocodiles, sea turtles, and mosasaurs shared the waters with sharks and fierce fanged-tooth fishes. The climate was warmer than today. Coon Creek was semi-tropical, like present-day southern Florida (Wade 1926). Heavy waves from severe tropical storms constantly churned up shallower parts of the sea floor.
A couple of miles to the east lay a marshy lowland bordering the limestone bluffs of the Western Highland Rim of the Nashville Done, home to duckbill and theropod dinosaurs. Sluggish rivers annually washed tons of driftwood, along with the occasional dinosaur carcass, from this heavily forested area into the bay (Russell and Parks 1975).
The Geology Of The Mississippi Embayment And Coon Creek.
This thumb print-shaped bay extends roughly north-south from central Mississippi to southern Illinois. It was formed when rocks, weakened by gradual spreading of the North American continent, sagged into a wide, shallow trough. The Gulf of Mexico filled the trough on several occasions between 80 and 50 million years ago. The Mississippi Embayment stretched West from the Tennessee Valley to the area of Little Rock, Arkansas. It may have been 1,000 feet deep where Memphis is now. The embayment gradually filled with sand, clay, and gravel brought in by rivers on uplands to the north, east, and west (Wade 1926). 
The margins of the bay teemed with marine life. Crabs, snails, lobsters, clams, scallops, whelks, nautilus, sharks, and other familiar animals lived in the warm, shallow sea, eating, reproducing, and being eaten (Sohl 1960 and 1964). Giant reptilian mosasaurs, highly ornamented cephalopods, and other less familiar sea creatures lived in the water. Their shells, bones, carapaces, teeth, and other hard parts were constantly being buried in the sandy mud of the sea floor. The lack of distinct layering indicates that clams, shrimps, and other burrowing organisms mixed the bottom sediments. Periodic hurricanes may have brought in heavy loads of river sediment to bury the plants and animals living there. Conditions for life were ideal; the water was warm and of normal salinity (Wade 1926). Wave action ensured sufficient oxygenation for animal life.
Ancient Life.
Many rivers fed into the sea bringing leaves and driftwood from the land. These served as the base of the food chain. Bacteria and other microscopic scavengers ate the decaying wood. Plankton ate the bacteria. Clams filtered the small plankton. Snails ate the clams and were eaten in turn by crabs and fish. Mosasaurs and cephalopods ate the fish and crabs. Some organisms were swimmers or floaters, but most lived on or in the sandy mud of the sea bottom. This layer of sandy clay, bones, and shells became the Coon Creek Formation.
Fossils.
Most organisms are not preserved as fossils. Unless covered quickly after death, their bodies are consumed by other animals and plants or destroyed by weather. Even the bones and shells of animals which were quickly buried after death may be later dissolved by groundwater. The clay in the sediment at Coon Creek sealed off the fragile fossils from the corrosive action of water and the hard parts of the clams, snails, crabs, and shrimps were well preserved. Occasionally the bones of vertebrates are found, as well as the cartilaginous vertebrae of sharks. Fish scales and plant leaves are sometimes found as well (Wade 1926).
Dinosaurs.
Dinosaur fossils have not been found in the Coon Creek Formation. While dinosaurs did roam the land of central Tennessee during the same time period, they were land animals and did not live in the sea. Sometimes the dried carcasses of dinosaurs were washed out to sea by rivers. Dinosaur bones and teeth have been found in marine deposits in Mississippi. It is possible that dinosaur bones will turn up at Coon Creek someday. The remains of at least two mosasaurs have been found. They were not dinosaurs but large aquatic lizards that could reach lengths of up to 45 feet. They were carnivorous and would have been the top of the food chain in the Coon Creek area.
Importance.
Coon Creek has been named as one of the country's top twelve fossils sites for several reasons (Noble 1996).
• The fossils are found in their original state. The hard shells have not been permeated by groundwater and not replaced by minerals. 
• The number of fossils is stupendous. Many times you will literally find fossils on top of fossils. Most fossil sites require concentrated efforts to find a representative sample of the fossils. 
• There is a rich diversity of the animals with over 600 different species of organisms found. 
• Because the Coon Creek Formation sediment is unconsolidated, it makes it very easy to collect and prepare the fossils.
Age.
Geologists employ biostratigraphy, the use of index fossils, for dating sedimentary rock units like the Coon Creek. Index fossils are species of plants or animals that existed over a wide area for a geologically short period of time (Russell and Parks 1975). The cephalopod "Jeletzkytes nodosus" is a time-sensitive fossil found in rocks a little younger than 70.6 million years old in the western United States. Other index fossils from Coon Creek date a little older than 70.6 million years. The overlap indicates that Coon Creek sediments were probably deposited between 70 and 71 million years ago.

Mike Fontenot

Michael Eugene "Mike" Fontenot (born June 9, 1980) is a professional baseball infielder in the Tampa Bay Rays organization. He has played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies.
High school career.
Mike Fontenot was a standout for Salmen High School in Slidell, Louisiana. After his senior year, he was drafted in the 21st round (625th overall) of the 1999 MLB Amateur Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but chose to attend Louisiana State University on a baseball scholarship instead of going professional.
College career.
At Louisiana State, Fontenot received National Freshman of the Year recognition as LSU's starting second baseman, batting .353 (103-for-292) with 13 doubles, three triples, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, 93 runs, and eight steals. He became the third LSU player to win National Freshman of the Year award, following second baseman Todd Walker (1992) and pitcher Brett Laxton (1993). Fontenot's 17 home runs set an LSU freshman record, surpassing the previous mark of 15 established by Blair Barbier in 1997. 
In 2000, he was named to the NCAA Baton Rouge Regional all-tournament team, hitting .400 (6-for-15) with two doubles, one home run, five RBI, and five runs scored. He was named to the College World Series all-tournament team as he hit a team-best .462 (6-for-13) with two doubles, one home run, two RBI, and six runs scored. He, along with future Chicago Cubs teammate Ryan Theriot, was a member of the LSU Tigers baseball team that won the 2000 College World Series. The second baseman was LSU's leading hitter in the NCAA Baseball Tournament, batting .432 (16-for-37) in nine games with four doubles, two home runs and nine RBI.
Professional career.
After his time at LSU, Fontenot was chosen in the first round (19th overall) of the 2001 MLB Amateur Entry Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. Fontenot signed with the Orioles, garnering a $1,300,000.00 signing bonus as part of the deal.
Fontenot began his minor league career with the Frederick Keys of the Single-A advanced Carolina League in 2002. In 122 games, he batted .264 with 127 hits, eight home runs, and 53 RBI. In 2003, he played for the Bowie Baysox of the Double-A Eastern League. In 126 games, he batted .325 (second in the league to Alex Ríos's .352) with 146 hits (ninth), 12 home runs, and 66 RBI.
Fontenot played for the Ottawa Lynx of the Triple-A International League in 2004. In 136 games (tied with Earl Snyder for fourth in the league behind Bry Nelson's 142, Víctor Díaz's 141, and Jhonny Peralta's 138), he batted .279 with 146 hits, eight home runs, 49 RBI, and 10 triples (tied for second in the league with John Rodriguez and Pete Orr behind Mark Budzinski's 15). Entering the 2005 season, "Baseball America" ranked Fontenot the seventh-best prospect in the Orioles' organization.
Chicago Cubs.
On February 3, 2005, Fontenot was traded to the Chicago Cubs along with 2B/OF Jerry Hairston, Jr. and RHP Dave Crouthers for slugger Sammy Sosa. Until his trade to the San Francisco Giants on August 11, 2010, Fontenot was the only remaining player from that trade still with the Cubs. As part of the Cubs' farm system, Fontenot played for the Iowa Cubs of the AAA Pacific Coast League (2005–2007).
Fontenot made his Major League debut with the Cubs on April 13, 2005. In seven games with the team, he went 0-for-2 with 2 walks and 4 runs scored. In 2006, he spent the entire season with Iowa, batting .296 with 107 hits, eight home runs, and 36 RBI in 111 games. He did not return to the Cubs until May 15, 2007, when he was promoted from AAA to replace relief pitcher Rocky Cherry. He wore Mark Grace's old number, 17. After a fast start, including finishing second in the National League Rookie of the Month voting for June 2007, he became the Cubs' starting second baseman in 2009. After batting .231 into mid-August, Fontenot lost his position as the Cubs everyday second baseman, splitting time with Jeff Baker.
On May 7, 2010, Fontenot hit his first career grand slam against the Cincinnati Reds. It was Fontenot's first home run of the 2010 season, coming in the eighth inning off the first pitch from Carlos Fisher, with the Cubs up 10–4.
San Francisco Giants.
On August 11, 2010, Fontenot was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Evan Crawford. On October 23, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies in six games to advance to the World Series. Fontenot got a hit in his only at-bat in the NLCS clinching game. He was part of the 25-man World Series roster and has the unusual distinction of being credited with appearing in the World Series with neither a plate appearance nor play in the field. In the eighth inning of Game 2, the left-handed-hitting Fontenot was announced as a pinch-hitter with the Giants leading the Rangers, 6–0. The Rangers replaced their right-handed pitcher with a left-hander, prompting the Giants to replace Fontenot with the right-handed Aaron Rowand. Rowand tripled. Fontenot did not appear in another game in the World Series which the Giants won in five games.
On April 13, 2011, Fontenot hit a go-ahead homer to help the Giants win 4-3 over the rival Los Angeles Dodgers.
On March 30, 2012, Fontenot was released by the Giants during Spring Training.
Philadelphia Phillies.
On April 13, 2012, the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to sign Fontenot to a minor league contract. He was initially assigned to the AAA Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs, but returned to Majors in May. On August 1, Fontenot was designated for assignment by the Phillies. Fontenot had a triple-slash of .289/.343/.340 in 45 games, but he was 1 for 15 against left-handed pitchers. Michael Martínez was recalled to take his place.
Tampa Bay Rays.
Fontenot was part of the Tampa Bay Rays organization in 2013, playing for the AAA Durham Bulls.
Washington Nationals.
On January 9, 2014 Fontenot signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He was released on March 26, 2014 after hitting just .105 in Spring Training.
Tampa Bay Rays.
Fontenot signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays on March 28, 2014, and was assigned to Triple-A Durham.

Steve Veltman

Stephen James Veltman (b. August 4, 1969 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later raised in Conroe, Texas U.S.) is a former American "Old School/Mid School" professional Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1980–1985 and 1987 to 1998. His nickname during the time he first achieved fame as a 12 and 13 year old was "Spider-Man" due to the posture he had as he speed jumped his bicycle over moguls. He would be tucked all the way back over and just above the rear wheel. His right elbow would be down while his left up as opposed to having them near perfectly level. This along with his red and white Hutch uniform and helmet with mirrored lensed goggles gave an impression of the comic book superhero Spider-Man swinging on his web. His later moniker "V"-Dog" came into being concurrently with him joining the Vans Racing Team in April 1991. He was also known as "Primetime".

<doc id="5877760" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877760" title="The Lost Chord">
The Lost Chord

"The Lost Chord" is a song composed by Arthur Sullivan in 1877 at the bedside of his brother Fred during Fred's last illness. The manuscript is dated 13 January 1877; Fred Sullivan died five days later. The lyric was written as a poem by Adelaide Anne Procter called "A Lost Chord," published in 1858 in "The English Woman's Journal". 
The song was immediately successful and became particularly associated with American contralto Antoinette Sterling, with Sullivan's close friend and mistress, Fanny Ronalds, and with British contralto Clara Butt. Sullivan was proud of the song and later noted: "I have composed much music since then, but have never written a second Lost Chord."
Many singers have recorded the song, including Enrico Caruso, who sang it at the Metropolitan Opera House on 29 April 1912 at a benefit concert for families of victims of the "Titanic" disaster. The piece has endured as one of Sullivan's best-known songs, and the setting is still performed today. 
Background.
In 1877, Arthur Sullivan was already Britain's foremost composer, having already produced such critically praised pieces as his "Irish Symphony", his "Overture di Ballo", many hymns and songs, such as "Onward, Christian Soldiers", and the popular short operas "Cox and Box" and "Trial by Jury". Adelaide Anne Procter was an extremely popular poet in Britain, second in fame only to Alfred Lord Tennyson. On the early published sheet music for the song, Procter's name is written in larger letters than Sullivan's. Sullivan's father's death had inspired him to write his "Overture In C (In Memoriam)" over a dozen years earlier. 
The composer's brother, Fred Sullivan was an actor who appeared mostly in operettas and comic operas. Playwright F. C. Burnand wrote of Fred: "As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest. The brothers were devoted to each other, but Arthur went up, and poor little Fred went under." Fred played roles in Offenbach operettas, among others, in London and on tour. He created the roles of Apollo in Gilbert and Sullivan's "Thespis" (1871), and the Learned Judge in their "Trial by Jury" (1875). He most likely would have played the title role in Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Sorcerer" (1877), but he fell ill in 1876 and died before that work was produced.
During Fred's final illness, Arthur visited his brother frequently at his home on King's Road in Fulham, London. The composer had tried to set Procter's poem to music five years previously but had not been satisfied by the effort. As he had been inspired by his grief at the death of their father, he was again inspired to compose by his brother's decline. At Fred's bedside, he sketched out the music to "The Lost Chord". Although not written for sale, the song became the biggest commercial success of any British or American song of the 1870s and 1880s. The American contralto Antoinette Sterling became one of its leading proponents, as did Sullivan's close friend and sometime mistress, Fanny Ronalds, who often sang it at society functions. Dame Clara Butt recorded the song several times, as did many others, including Enrico Caruso in 1912. A copy of the music was buried with Ronalds, who bequeathed the manuscript to Butt in 1914. Butt's husband, baritone Kennerley Rumford, gave the manuscript to the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1950.
Musicologist Derek B. Scott offers this analysis of the composition: 
1888 recording for Edison.
In 1888, Thomas Edison sent his "Perfected" Phonograph to Mr. George Gouraud in London, England, and on August 14, 1888, Gouraud introduced the phonograph to London in a press conference, including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of Sullivan's "The Lost Chord," one of the first recordings of music ever made. 
A series of parties followed, introducing the phonograph to members of society at the so-called "Little Menlo" in London. Sullivan was invited to one of these on October 5, 1888. After dinner, he recorded a speech to be sent to Thomas Edison, saying, in part: 
These recordings were discovered in the Edison Library in New Jersey in the 1950s.
Text.
<poem>
Seated one day at the organ,
I was weary and ill at ease,
And my fingers wandered idly
Over the noisy keys.
I know not what I was playing,
Or what I was dreaming then;
But I struck one chord of music,
Like the sound of a great Amen.
It flooded the crimson twilight,
Like the close of an angel's psalm,
And it lay on my fevered spirit
With a touch of infinite calm.
It quieted pain and sorrow,
Like love overcoming strife;
It seemed the harmonious echo
From our discordant life.
It linked all perplexèd meanings
Into one perfect peace,
And trembled away into silence
As if it were loth to cease.
I have sought, but I seek it vainly,
That one lost chord divine,
Which came from the soul of the organ,
And entered into mine.
It may be that death's bright angel
Will speak in that chord again,
It may be that only in Heav'n
I shall hear that grand Amen.
</poem>
Cultural influence.
There have been at least six films titled "The Lost Chord", as well as one titled "The Trail of the Lost Chord". In the 1999 film "Topsy-Turvy", a scene depicts Fanny Ronalds (played by Eleanor David) facetiously introducing it as "a new composition" at an 1884 party at her house; she then sings it with Sullivan (Allan Corduner) at the piano and Walter Simmonds (Matthew Mills) at the harmonium.
The "Strangers" TV series had an episode called "The Lost Chord."
Jimmy Durante recorded a humorous song called "I'm the Guy Who Found the Lost Chord", which he also sings in the 1947 film "This Time for Keeps". George and Ira Gershwin wrote a song called "That Lost Barber Shop Chord", which was included in their 1926 revue "Americana". In Michael Flanders and Donald Swann's comic song, "The Reluctant Cannibal", the opening line is "Seated one day at the tom-tom", a reference to the first line of "The Lost Chord." The Moody Blues produced an album called "In Search of the Lost Chord" in 1968.
The novel "Bad Wisdom" by Bill Drummond and Mark Manning concerns their trip to the North Pole with an icon of Elvis to search for the Lost Chord. Edith Wharton's novel "Ethan Frome" contains references to the song. In Isaac Asimov's Black Widowers story "The Quiet Place" (Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, March 1988), the traditional "Guest" of The Black Widowers hums this tune all through a dinner. Caryl Brahms wrote a book called "Gilbert and Sullivan: Lost Chords and Discords" (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1975). 
An organization called The Lost Chord describes itself as "a collaborative effort to nurture young talent from underprivileged communities and to foster a commitment to music and arts education accessibility in the New England community."

Palmar radiocarpal ligament

The palmar radiocarpal ligament (anterior ligament, volar radiocarpal ligament) is a broad membranous band, attached above to the distal end of the radius, to the scaphoid, lunate and the triquetrum of the carpal bones in the wrist. Some being continued to the capitate. 
In addition to this broad membrane, there is a rounded fasciculus, superficial to the rest, which reaches from the base of the styloid process of the ulna to the lunate and triangular bones. 
Perforations.
The ligament is perforated by apertures for the passage of vessels, 
Relations.
It is in relation, in front, with the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus.
Behind, it is closely adherent to the anterior border of the articular disk of the distal radioulnar articulation.
Components.
Some sources break down the components of the ligament as follows: radiolunate, radiocapitate, radiotriquetral, and radioscaphoid.
Other sources combine the radioscaphoid and radiocapitate into a "radioscaphocapitate".

St. Louis Limestone

The St. Louis Limestone is a large geologic formation covering a wide area of the midwest of the United States. It is named after an exposure at St. Louis, Missouri. It consists of sedimentary limestone with scattered chert beds, including the heavily chertified Lost River Chert Bed in the Horse Cave Member. It is exposed at the surface through western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee, including the city of Clarksville, Tennessee. The limestone deposit is Mississippian in age, in the Meramecian series, roughly 300 million years old.
Fossils commonly found in the St. Louis include the rugosan corals "Lithostrotion" and "Lithostrotionella" and the bryozoan "Fenestrellina".

Intermetacarpal articulations

The intermetacarpal articulations are joints in the hand formed between the metacarpal bones. The bases of the second, third, fourth and fifth metacarpal bones articulate with one another by small surfaces covered with cartilage. The metacarpal bones are connected together by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments.
The synovial membrane for these joints is continuous with that of the carpometacarpal joints.

St. Louis shag

St. Louis shag is a swing dance that evolved from Charleston. As its name suggests, it is recognized as being started in St. Louis, Missouri. It is a very fast closed position dance that is usually done to stomp, jump, and boogie-woogie music.
The dance may be done in the "side-by-side" Charleston position. The steps are: rock step, kick forward, step down, kick forward (other leg), stag, step, stomp (repeat). The "stag" is bringing the leg up with the knee bent. As a variation, when repeating, one can do two forward kicks (or "switch, switch," referring to switching feet) in place of the rock step.

Gilbert de Moravia

Gilbert de Moravia (died 1245), later known as Saint Gilbert of Dornoch, or Gilbert of Caithness, was the most famous Bishop of Caithness and founder of Dornoch Cathedral. His name may suggest that he came from the semi-Gaelicized family of Flemish origin who were Lords of Duffus, and who during Gilbert's episcopate would create the Earldom of Sutherland under Gilbert's possible cousin, William de Moravia, 1st Earl of Sutherland.
Life.
It is known that Gilbert was the son of one Muiredach, son of Alexander "de Moravia" ("of Moray", thus indicating the ancestral home and not necessarily a family name). If Gilbert was of purely Gaelic origin, his name may be a Francization of the Gaelic name "Gille Brigte" (modern: "Gillebrìghde"). Gilbert allegedly had a younger brother, Richard de Moravia, who was killed fighting against Scandinavians and whose effigy-sarcophagus currently resides in the cathedral.
As his name indicates, Gilbert very likely came from Moray. The family owned extensive lands in Duffus and Strabok. Gilbert was for a long time the Archdeacon of the Bishopric of Moray; it is probable that Gilbert was elected to the see sometime in the year 1223, in the presence of King Alexander II of Scotland and his army. He was certainly bishop of Caithness by the summer of 1224. King Alexander probably decided that, after the murder of Gilbert's predecessor Adam of Melrose, the bishopric's seat ("cathedra") should be moved closer to royal protection. So it was that Gilbert's episcopate saw the move of the bishopric from Halkirk in the far north of the diocese to Dornoch in the far south. It was to the new cathedral that, in 1239, Gilbert would move Bishop Adam's body. Gilbert nevertheless continued to reside for much of his episcopate in the more violent north, and maintained a palace at Scrabster.
Achievements and death.
Gilbert's achievements include the building of the cathedral at Dornoch, and the establishment of several hospices for the poor. He became known as a fine preacher, and he did much work to civilise his diocese. 
Gilbert died in his palace at Scrabster in 1245, traditionally on 1 April. The latter day is his feast day. He was buried at Dornoch, and his relics were venerated until the Reformation, oaths being sworn on them at least until 1545. He is the last Scottish saint to appear in the Calendar of Saints, although it is not known if he was ever formally canonized.
Folklore surrounding St Gilbert was collected in Sutherlandshire in the late nineteenth century, including a legend of how he overcame a dragon—or salamander—that was terrorising the country.

New Zealand EM class electric multiple unit

The New Zealand EM/ET class (also known as Ganz-Mavag) electric multiple units are used on Metlink suburban services in Wellington, New Zealand. They are owned by the Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) and operated by Tranz Metro, part of national railway operator KiwiRail.
The 44 two-car units of an EM motor car and an ET trailer car were introduced between 1982 and 1983 on the 1500 V DC electrified Kapiti Line, Hutt Valley Line and Melling Line. Since the introduction of the "Matangi" FP/FT class in 2011–12, they have largely been relegated to peak services.
The name "Ganz-Mavag" comes from the units' manufacturer, Ganz-Mavag of Hungary. It is widely used by the GWRC and in the media to distinguish them from other electric multiple units used on the Wellington suburban lines.
Introduction.
The cost was NZ$33 million, then the single largest order of rolling stock in New Zealand Railways Department's history. This cost was partially offset by a barter agreement involving the Hungarian Government buying New Zealand dairy products, chiefly butter.
Their introduction spelled the end of the carriage trains hauled by the EW electric locomotives, though electric-hauled carriage trains were temporary reintroduced behind the EO locomotives between 2008-2011, and Wairarapa Line services are diesel-hauled. A number of the older English Electric DM/D units were retained, mainly for use on the Melling and Johnsonville Lines.
The introduction of the units also coincided with the project to extend the electrification on the Kapiti Coast from Paekakariki to Paraparaumu.
Service.
The EM class have served as the primary rail commuter vehicle since their introduction in 1982, running in anything from a single unit (2-cars) to an 8-car unit depending on the service being operated. They have also seen service beyond the electrification, being used behind diesel locomotives as carriages to carry people to the annual Toast Martinborough wine festival in the Wairarapa.
The introduction of the new Matangi units from 2010 has seen a reduction in the number of services being operated by the class, with most off-peak services handed over to the Matangi’s in June 2012. However the ability of the EM’s to run in an 8-car formation, something the Matangi’s are limited in doing owing to the amount of current that they draw from the overhead system, continues to see them utilised for the more heavily patronised peak services, particularly on the Kapiti Line.
Johnsonville Line.
The class were not operated on the Johnsonville Line as they were out-of-gauge and had insufficient braking capacity. While tunnel and platform clearances were improved in 2009, it was not envisaged that the units would be used on the line; due to their limited braking power on the steep grades.
Two units have visited Johnsonville on test trains; on Sunday 14 June 1992 EM 1004 and its trailer ET 3004 was towed behind shunter DSC 2285 to measure clearances at platforms and tunnels. On Sunday 18 April 2010 EM 1056 plus trailer ET 3056 ran under its own power on a trial to check clearances for the Matangi units.
Accidents.
Three units were involved in a collision north of Plimmerton on 30 September 2010. The northbound train (consisting of EM 1010, ET 3010, EM 1154 and ET 3154) derailed after hitting a slip caused by heavy rain and fouled of the southbound line. Less than a minute later it was struck by southbound unit EM 1223 and ET 3223, which did not derail, but the collision caused extensive damage to both cabs. Sixty passengers and crew were on the two trains. Two people were hospitalised. The drivers of the trains were father and son.
The damaged units were initially towed back to the EMU depot north of Wellington station, where later the two undamaged halves - EM 1010 and ET 3223 (renumbered to ET 3010) were marshalled together as a unit. The damaged cars, EM 1223 and the original ET 3010, were towed to storage at the Hutt Workshops and used as parts sources.
On 20 May 2013, ET 3309 derailed crossing Wairarapa junction, on the approach to Wellington Railway Station, puncturing a hole in the floor. It was the rear car in a two-unit consist operating the 07:43 Porirua to Wellington service, subsequently stranding thousands of morning peak commuters across the network as it blocked both the Kapiti and Hutt Valley lines. All units were temporarily withdrawn after the derailment for urgent safety inspections, but most were back in service for morning peak the next day. Preliminary investigations suggest when one of the unit's spring park brake assemblies was replaced in March 2013, two split pins were not inserted into the bolts securing the assembly to the undercarriage, allowing the assembly to come loose over time and ultimately caused the derailment. Two air reservoir tanks came loose in the accident and pushed the air compressor behind them upwards through the floor, creating the hole.
Other incidents involving EM units include:
Refurbishment.
In 1995 a major refurbishment program of the class began, with the EMUs repainted in the then standard Tranz Rail Cato light blue and yellow livery with new seats and brighter interiors. This refurbishment program was completed by 2002.
Other minor upgrades were made in the mid-2000s, replacing the original diamond pantographs with single-arm ones and adding ditch lights.
In 2008 a proposed refurbishment was deferred until the new Matangi units were available. The projected expenditure was $23.3 million in 2008 - 2009. The prototype refurbished unit was completed at the end of 2010.
EM 1373 and ET 3373 were fully refurbished to ascertain unit costs and gauge public opinion, including repainting into the new Metlink livery. A decision to refurbish others in the fleet was made on 10 March 2011 as part of an $88 million rail upgrade package, instead of purchasing more Matangi. However in August 2012 GWRC announced its preference for ordering 35 more Matangi units instead of refurbishing the remaining units. 
Withdrawals.
The introduction of the Matangi units allowed for the withdrawal of several Ganz units, with those in the best mechanical condition retained for running peak services only. Those units that were withdrawn were stored initially at Thorndon, before most were relocated to the Hutt Workshops. GWRC called for expressions of interest in the disposal of these units.
In June 2013 GWRC announced that it had come to terms for both the purchase of an additional 35 Matangi units and the sale of 42 of the Ganz units to a South African buyer, with one unit to be retained in New Zealand for preservation.
Shipping of 17 units withdrawn as of 1 January 2014 commenced from 17-19 February 2014 with loading into the cargo vessel MV Pangani bound for South Africa were they will be converted into carriages for operation in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The remaining units will be shipped once replaced by the second tranche of Matangi units from mid-2015

Sid Collins

Sid Collins (born Sidney Cahn Jr.) (July 17, 1922 – May 2, 1977) was an American broadcaster best known as the radio voice of the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network from 1952-1976. Collins coined the phrase describing the annual May motorsports event as "the greatest spectacle in racing."
Background.
Born into a Jewish family that owned a neighborhood store in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cahn changed his professional name to Collins for fear of anti-semitism and discrimination in his chosen field of broadcasting.
Announcing.
Collins worked for WIBC in Indianapolis. One year after he started at the 50,000-watt station, he became the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) track announcer for the south turn. He became a radio announcer for the track after Bill Slater became ill. He was named the chief announcer in 1952. That year he introduced his "full coverage concept", which replaced a five minute rundown each hour. He sent letters to all of the radio stations on their network, but only 26 stations participated. The next year 110 stations participated and the number grew until it became 1,200 by 1980. 
With live television coverage of the race prohibited until 1986, Collins' radio coverage drew a large audience every year, and his announcing as the "voice of the 500" became synonymous with the race itself. He told the world the deaths, accidents, incidents and crashes during the race. Collins received over 30,000 letters asking for a copy of the eulogy that he gave to Eddie Sachs after Sachs died in a crash on the second lap of the 1964 Indianapolis 500.
Collins also anchored TVS Television Network auto racing from Trenton, Milwaukee, Langhorne, Castle Rock, and Colorado for two years. He hosted national TV coverage of the Indianapolis 500 Festival parade with Garry Moore, Steve Allen and Bob Barker for Hughes Sports Network. He was the subject of stories in "Hot Rod" magazine and "The Saturday Evening Post".
Collins always signed off by quoting a serious thought or some poetry.
Death.
In April 1977 Collins was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease. After learning he had the incurable progressive paralyzing disease, Collins confided to friend and Indianapolis 500 anchor successor Paul Page that he was planning to take his own life. Collins committed suicide on May 2, 1977. He was 54. Collins had been scheduled to announce his 30th Indianapolis 500 on May 29.
Awards.
Collins received nine American Auto Racing Writers & Broadcasters Association awards as the best auto racing broadcaster in the nation. He was cited by the Indiana University radio/TV school as an outstanding graduate and was inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 1979.

Joice NanKivell Loch

Joice NanKivell Loch MBE (24 January 18878 October 1982) was an Australian author, journalist and humanitarian worker who worked with refugees in Poland, Greece and Romania after World War I and World War II. She was Australia's most highly decorated woman.
Biography.
Joice Mary NanKivell was born at Farnham sugar cane plantation in Ingham in far north Queensland in 1887. Her father acted as manager of the plantation for Fanning, NanKivell, a company run by the Fanning brothers and her wealthy grandfather, Thomas NanKivell. The family fortune was lost however when Kanaka labour was abolished and Joice and her parents walked off the property virtually penniless. Her father, George NanKivell, took a job as manager on a run-down property in Gippsland where Joice grew up. She had wanted to become a doctor but the family was unable to pay university fees and so she helped on the property until she was 26 years old. After the death of her brother during World War I, her father abandoned the farm and Joice went to Melbourne where she worked for the Professor of Classics at the University of Melbourne and reviewed books for the "Melbourne Herald". 
She met her husband, Gallipoli veteran Sydney Loch when she reviewed his anti-war book "To Hell and Back, the banned story of Gallipoli", which told of the horrors of that campaign. The book had been banned by the military censor fearful that if the truth about the slaughter at Gallipoli were revealed young men would stop enlisting to fight in France.
Joice and Sydney Loch went to Poland as aid workers for the Quaker Relief Movement with the aim of writing a book about the damage that Lenin's troops had inflicted on Poland and were awarded medals by the President of Poland for their humanitarian work. In 1922 they went to Greece as aid workers following the burning of Smyrna. The Lochs worked in a Quaker-run refugee camp on the outskirts of Thessaloniki for two years before being given a peppercorn rent on a Byzantine tower by the sea in the refugee village of Ouranoupoli, the last settlement before Mount Athos.
To help the villagers, Loch purchased looms so that the women could work as rug weavers; she designed Byzantine rugs, one of which is now on display in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. She also acted as a medical orderly and held regular clinics for the villagers. For their work in Greece the couple were awarded medals by the King of the Hellenes.
"Operation Pied Piper".
During World War II, Loch was awarded another two medals by the Governments of Romania and Poland for saving a thousand Polish and Jewish children from the Nazis by leading a daring escape known as "Operation Pied Piper" from Romania where they were running a refugee centre for Poles who had escaped from the Nazis and the Russian invasion. Subsequently the Lochs ran a refugee camp for Poles at Haifa. In 1953 they returned to Greece and their tower home and re-established the Pirgos rug industry in Ouranoupolis.
Marriage.
Sydney Loch (1888 - 6 February 1955) was a Gallipoli veteran and a humanitarian worker. He was born in London, raised in Scotland, and sailed to Australia in 1905, aged 17, working first as a jackaroo. He joined the Australian forces at the outbreak of the First World War and served in Gallipoli until being discharged for wounds and illness. He later became a journalist and writer. He and Joice NanKivell wed in 1919. They sailed for England and secured a contract to write a book on Ireland, which was published as "Ireland in Travail". 
Other honours.
In addition to the honours bestowed on her by Greece, Romania and Poland, she was also honoured by Serbia and her home country Australia, In 1972 on the recommendation of the Australian government she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for "international relations". These multiple honours resulted in her becoming Australia's most highly decorated woman.
Deaths.
Sydney Loch died on 6 February 1955. Joice Loch died in her home in Ouranoupoli on 8 October 1982, aged 95.

Lincoln-Way East High School

Lincoln-Way East High School or LWE, is a four-year public high school located approximately three miles south of Interstate 80 near the intersection of La Grange Road and Lincoln Highway in Frankfort, Illinois, a southern suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is a part of Lincoln-Way Community High School District 210, which also includes Lincoln-Way Central High School, Lincoln-Way North High School, and Lincoln-Way West High School.
History.
In December 1974, voters approved a $4,985,000 bond issue to develop a new freshman-sophomore building on the Frankfort site. Construction began in the summer of 1975, and the school opened in the fall of 1977 as Lincoln-Way High School East Campus. In November 1992, voters agreed to double the size of the campus to accommodate growth. Facilities added included a 42 classroom academic wing, a field house and auditorium. The expansion was completed in March 1995.
In 1997, citizens of District #210 approved a $60 million building bond referendum to split the existing freshmen-sophomore / junior senior configuration into two separate four year high schools and to add to the existing East and Central Campuses. The East Campus added 50 classrooms and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. While the Central Campus added 50 classrooms, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a performing arts auditorium, as well as a new nursing office and new PPO offices. The splitting of Lincoln-Way into two separate high schools became official for the 2001-02 school year as the East Campus became Lincoln-Way East High School.
Academics.
In 2008, Lincoln-Way East juniors scored 33rd in the state of Illinois on the Prairie State Achievement Exam. The staff is 204 teachers, of whom 6% have an advanced degree. Lincoln-Way East Mathletes won 10th in the SWSC Competition, and 47th in the Regional Competition. In 2011, Lincoln-Way East became the 11th school out of 656 (top 2%) in Illinois to place in the Prairie State Achievement Exam.
In total, Lincoln-Way East offers its students twenty-one AP courses.
As of 2012, Lincoln-Way East and the other Lincoln-Ways offer honor, advanced placement, college prep, and individualized courses within the guidelines created by the State of Illinois. The graduation rate of Lincoln-Way East's students, as well as the other Lincoln-Ways, is around 96.2%. More than 88% of the students that graduate continue on towards higher education.
Lincoln-Way East brings in an array of different class types for students in the district. With this, agriculture, business, ROTC, career and technology, family and consumer science courses as with many more. Lincoln-Way East creates avenues for students to potentially whittle down to what they want to gravitate towards for a higher education degree in.

Lam Sonthi District

Lam Sonthi () is the easternmost district ("Amphoe") of Lopburi Province, central Thailand.
History.
Lam Sonthi was created as a minor district ("King Amphoe") on April 1, 1989, by splitting off five "tambon" from the district Chai Badan. It was upgraded to a full Amphoe on December 5, 1996. The sixth "tambon" Khao Noi was created in 1994.
Geography.
The name Lam Sonthi comes from the small Sonthi River that originates in the Sap Langka Wildlife Sanctuary, the last forest of Lopburi, located in Tambon Kut Ta Phet in the very north of the district.
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Si Thep and Wichian Buri of Phetchabun Province, Thep Sathit of Chaiyaphum Province, Thepharak, Dan Khun Thot and Sikhio of Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Muak Lek of Saraburi Province, and Tha Luang and Chai Badan of Lopburi Province.
To the east the district boundary is formed by the Phang Hoei ridge, while the boundary in the northwest is formed by the Luak ridge, both ridges part of the Phetchabun mountain range.
Administration.
The district is subdivided into 6 subdistricts ("tambon"), which are further subdivided into 49 villages ("muban"). There are no municipal ("thesaban") areas, and further 4 Tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

Plantar calcaneocuboid ligament

The plantar calcaneocuboid ligament (short calcaneocuboid ligament; short plantar ligament) is a ligament on the bottom of the foot that connects the calcaneus to the cuboid bone. It lies deep to the long plantar ligament. 
Structure.
The plantar calcaneocuboid ligament lies nearer to the bones than the long plantar ligament, from which it is separated by a little areolar tissue. 
It is a short but wide band of great strength, and extends from the tubercle and the depression in front of it, on the forepart of the plantar surface of the calcaneus, to the plantar surface of the cuboid behind the groove for the fibularis longus tendon.

Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament

The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (also known as the spring ligament) is a ligament on the underside of the foot that connects the calcaneus with the navicular bone. 
Structure.
The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament is a broad and thick band of fibers, which connects the anterior margin of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus to the plantar surface of the navicular. 
This ligament not only serves to connect the calcaneus and navicular, but supports the head of the talus, forming part of the articular cavity in which it is received. 
The dorsal surface of the ligament presents a fibrocartilaginous facet, lined by the synovial membrane, and upon this a portion of the head of the talus rests.
Its plantar surface is supported by the tendon of the tibialis posterior; its medial border is blended with the forepart of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.
The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament helps to maintain the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and by providing support to the head of the talus bears the major portion of the body weight.

<doc id="5877934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877934" title="Storm Over Arnhem">
Storm Over Arnhem

Storm Over Arnhem (1981) is a board wargame designed by Courtney F. Allen, published by the Avalon Hill game company, and depicts the battle for Arnhem bridge over the Lower Rhine river during Operation Market Garden in World War II. This battle was fought between elements of the British 1st Airborne Division and elements of the German Bocholt Battalion and 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. The plan was for the airborne forces to seize and hold the Arnhem bridge for two days, before being relieved by the British XXX Corps. However, Operation Market Garden failed in numerous places, and the airborne troops were never relieved. They did however achieve more than their objective by capturing and holding the northern end of the Arnhem Bridge with some 700+ men for four days.
Game-play.
The game recreates the fighting around the northern end of Arnhem bridge during the days of September 18 through September 21, 1944. One player controls the British units, while a second player controls the Germans.
Initial unit deployment is semi-free. For example, a certain number of SS units must be placed in each initial deployment zone, but the German player is free to choose which units he will put there.
The game is divided into a number of turns. A day turn is 6 hours, and a night turn is 12 hours, and there are three turns in a single day, 2 day turns and 1 night turn. Each turn is divided into 5 phases: Reinforcement & Reformed Units Phase, Random Events Phase, Movement/Fire Phase, Close Combat Phase and the Victory Point Determination Phase.
The Movement/Fire Phase consists of a number of player impulses, which means that during this phase a player can move or attack with his uncommitted units in a single area. An uncommitted unit differs from a committed unit by the fact that the latter is a unit that has already moved or attacked on that same turn, or that the unit has taken casualties or was forced to retreat on that turn. Players alternate impulses until there are no more uncommitted units, or both players pass their impulse. Next the close combat phase is played out for each area containing both British and German units.
The objective of the game is for the Germans to gain at least 22 victory point by the end of the last turn, to win a marginal victory, or for the British to withhold the Germans from those victory point. Victory points are allocated for every victory point area the German player occupies.
Game-board.
The game-board is a map of the surroundings of the northern side of Arnhem bridge on a 1" = 100' scale and is divided into 30 areas of various size and shape to represent the unique characteristics of both the build-up in the area (such as buildings and trees) and the line of sight, which determines and limits the possibilities of attacking and moving units across the board. This system is known as the area movement system, as opposed to the hexagonal boards, where units attack and move through a number of hexes. Storm Over Arnhem was the first game to use the area movement system, which was later used in such games as "Break Out:Normandy" and "Thunder Over Casino". "Axis & Allies" and "Risk" are also examples of area movement systems. Surrounding the Arnhem map are five movement zones, depicting the areas outside Arnhem, which can be used to quickly move units from one side of town to the other side.
Variant.
The game came with a number of counters (playing pieces) which were not used with the basic game, but could be used for playing a variant game of "Storm Over Arnhem". That variant game would be published in a future issue of Avalon Hill's "The General Magazine". The variant was called "The Crossing", and let the players recreate the famous and costly assault by Viktor Graebner's reconnaissance unit (of the German 9th SS Panzer Division) across the Arnhem bridge, where they suffered heavy losses. Also, the variant game begins on the evening of September 17, instead of the afternoon of September 18. The British units start out in the movement zones, and the only German units in Arnhem consist of a small Arnhem Garrison.
"General Magazine".
Avalon Hill's "The General Magazine" published a series of articles on "Storm Over Arnhem", including a variant to the game, as mentioned above. A two-part series replay was also printed.

Kiki Carter

Kiki Carter born Kimberli Wilson (b. November 21, 1957 in Gainesville, Florida) is an environmental activist, organizer, musician, songwriter, and columnist.
Personal life.
She was the first of four children, born to a father of British descent, Harold Wilson, and an Italian mother, Priscilla Normandy (Patti Greenwood). She attended 12 different schools before graduating from Gainesville High School in 1974. She entered the University of Florida at age 16, where she majored in music performance and music education.
While in Los Angeles, in May 1984, Carter married first husband Rick Carter, over her manager's strong protests. She had only known him for one month when they eloped to Las Vegas. They returned to Gainesville, and their son Richard was born in 1986.
In February 1998, Carter married singer/songwriter, Greg Webb, the lead singer of the Gainesville, Florida based Rhythm and Blues Revue, changing her name to Kiki Webb. They began collaborating musically and formed the acoustic duo, "dancing Light" (Sunblossom Records). The name dancing Light came from a song of the same title, written about a vision Carter (then Kimberli Wilson) had after a near-death experience.
Carter and Webb moved to his family's property on Leech Lake in northern Minnesota in 2000.
Musical career.
As a euphonium student at the University of Florida Carter won the Sigma Alpha Iota "Outstanding Freshman Musician Award" for the 1974-75 year. Throughout her college years, Carter performed in various ensembles, symphonic bands and wind ensembles as principal/solo euphoniumist.
In the summer of 1976, Carter traveled to Ruston Louisiana to study with euphonium soloist, Raymond Young, then head of the Department of Music at Louisiana Tech University. She completed her junior year of college in Ruston, majoring in euphonium and minoring on piano, before returning to the University of Florida in the fall of 1978.
In 1979, University of Florida Music Department Chairman Budd Udell included a euphonium solo written for Carter in "Forces One", the first movement of his "Symphony for Band". The Symphony was premiered at the Music Educators National Conference convention in Miami Beach on April 9, 1980 with Carter performing the solo. The same year, Carter was one of eight national finalists in the Tubist Universal Brotherhood Association's national collegiate solo contest for euphonium.
Carter graduated from the University of Florida in March 1981 and briefly did post-baccalaureate work as a theater major, before leaving to audition for euphonium jobs in Washington D.C. military service bands. She started studying with Brian Bowman, euphonium soloist of the United States Air Force Band in Washington DC. During her studies in DC, Carter worked as a governess for Washington Post publisher, Donald Graham and his wife, Mary.
While in Washington DC, Carter began playing guitar and writing songs. She became disillusioned with the prospect of a professional military band career and returned to Gainesville in February 1982. Through a mutual friend, Carter met Michele Marino, who began managing Carter's career. Marino booked Carter's first television appearances a solo performer on The Kim Edstrom Show. Carter started playing in area clubs, often accompanied by pianist and singer, Sidney Bertisch.
In 1984, Carter and Marino travelled to Los Angeles, California, where Carter won the weekly music contest at the Palomino Club in North Hollywood The contest brought her to the attention of Capitol Records VP Joe McFadden who gave her his business card and suggested she contact him. Through manager, Michele, Carter came to the attention of Robert L. "Bumps" Blackwell, songwriter, record producer, and manager of Little Richard. Bumps arranged for Carter to sing with a group appearing in a 1983 Los Angeles television show with Billy Preston. Robert Blackwell managed Carter until his death in March 1985.
During those years, Carter made several trips from Gainesville to Nashville to meet with Capitol Records. Before a deal was struck, Capitol Records experienced a major restructuring and her contacts had been replaced.
She and her husband, Greg Webb, later began touring Minnesota, as the acoustic duo, Dancing Light. As Dancing Light, they released their first full-length CD, "Meadowdance" in 1993.
Carter and Webb co-founded independent record label Sunblossom Records, and she is founder of music publishing company Shebreana Music (BMI) They started Saturday Cafe Concert Series, a weekly Concert series in Northern Minnesota. They continued to perform at benefit concerts.
Activism.
At the end of 1986, Carter's mother, author Patti Greenwood learned of the US Department of Energy's plans to build a demonstration irradiation facility in Gainesville, Florida.
Greenwood shared the news with Carter. In early 1987, Carter called the local television station, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV to alert them to plans by the United States Department of Energy and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to build a food irradiation facility in Gainesville, Florida, using radioactive caesium-137. This project was part of the United States Department of Energy's By-Products Utilization Program (BUP). The BUP was born out of a Congressional mandate to find uses for by-products of plutonium production.
Carter was invited to appear live in the studio with the WCJB anchors. Soon a grassroots movement was galvanizing with Carter and her mother at the epicenter.
Carter and her mother founded the organization Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment (C.A.R.E.) to oppose the use of Department of Energy stores of radioactive caesium-137 in a demonstration food irradiation facility. The caesium-137 was slated to be used at six different demonstration irradiators through the country, one of which was proposed for Gainesville, Florida. After a groundswell of public opposition, public debates, and public forums, the caesium-137 was never used in the facility.
Carter organized a state-wide coalition of concerned citizens called the Florida Coalition to Stop Food Irradiation in response to plans for another irradiator in Plant City, FL. and national TV and helping to organize fledgling groups in other communities.
Working as an environmental activist expanded Carter's awareness of other environmental and social justice issues. She helped wherever she could, appearing at public meetings and performing at benefit concerts. She became active in helping to raise awareness of radon issues in Alachua County and helped provide free test kits to residents. Her pet projects included the I.C.E.S. fruition project, where she organized plantings of fruit trees in Habitat for Humanity homesites, and promoting the use of reusable bags in grocery stores.
Carter was an independent candidate in 1988 for the Alachua County Commission, losing to wildlife artist Kate Barnes.
In 1992, Carter wrote a weekly column for the Marion/Alachua edition of the "Tampa Tribune" called Environmentally Speaking.
Carter often used her musical talents and connections to organize and participate in fundraising concerts for her environmental causes, including a 1996 concert at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts featuring world-renowned violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and the Gainesville Chamber Orchestra. Carter also composed songs and produced regional television commercials for the United Way.
She became active in the Leech Lake Head Start program on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation where she chaired the parent committee of her son's Head Start program and was elected to chair the policy council of the Leech Lake Head Start program.
In the fall of 2005 Carter and her husband helped organize the Great Gala for the Gulf, a benefit concert for survivors of Hurricane Katrina, held at the Moondance Jam site in Northern Minnesota.
raising over $5,000 for relief to survivors.
Carter is currently a vocal proponent of the campaign to establish a United States Department of Peace

<doc id="5877939" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5877939" title="First solo flight">
First solo flight

The first solo flight of a new pilot comprises that pilot completing a take off, and usually a short flight and safe landing, by him or herself. Flying such a flight is a milestone known as soloing.
Requirements.
Depending on the country, there may be a requirement for some minimum number of training hours to have been completed by the student pilot before he or she is allowed to solo. In most countries, it is assumed that such students will be familiar with (and may have to pass an examination on) the relevant Air Laws or Regulations, and will have completed exercises in handling aircraft in normal conditions, and also what to do in the case of engine failure on takeoff, in flight, and before landing.
In the USA, for most aircraft, there is no FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) requirement for a minimum number of hours. Per FAR Part 61 SFAR 73 section 2, Robinson helicopters have a 20 hour requirement to solo. However the regulations do require that a student pilot show competency in several specific skills to include, for example, the ability to forward slip. In practice, competence is mostly a judgment call of the Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) responsible for the student. Typically, it takes from 10 to 30 hours of flight time before a pilot has the instinctive feel of an aircraft to be safe flying solo in other than perfect (no wind) weather.
Soloing.
In some cases, when the student is given permission to fly alone the instructor directs the student to fly three circuits of the traffic pattern each accompanied by a full stop landing. During the first circuit, the solo, the student's Flight instructor may supervise the student's performance from the ground, paying close attention to the approach and landing. Some instructors keep a radio handy, if there is one in the aircraft, in case the student pilot should need assistance or advice.
Traditions.
Several traditions have developed in the USA around "soloing", including drenching the student with water and cutting off and permanently displaying the back of his or her shirt.
In American aviation lore, the traditional removal of a new pilot's shirt tail is a sign of the instructor's new confidence in his student after successful completion of the 1st solo flight. In the days of tandem trainers, the student sat in the front seat, with the instructor behind. As there were often no radios in these early days of aviation, the instructor would tug on the student pilot's shirttail to get his attention, and then yell in his ear. A successful first solo flight is an indication that the student can fly without the instructor ("instructor-less" flight). Hence, there is no longer a need for the shirt tail, and it is cut off by the (often) proud instructor, and sometimes displayed as a trophy.

Wings Over Europe Tour

In the summer of 1972, Paul McCartney's newly formed band, Wings, set out on a concert tour of Europe.
Promotion.
Coming on the heels of a tour of English universities, the Wings Over Europe Tour was intended to promote recent singles "Give Ireland Back to the Irish" and "Mary Had a Little Lamb", as well as provide live recordings to be included on a future album. The second objective never came to fruition, however, and "Red Rose Speedway" was released in Spring of the next year without any of the concert material. Only the 21 August performance of "The Mess" at The Hague was officially released, as a b-side to Number One single "My Love".
Touring.
The band, with the McCartney children and their road crew, loaded up in a brightly coloured double decker bus for the tour of the continent. The tour proceeded largely without incident, but on 10 August in Gothenburg, Sweden, Paul and Linda McCartney were arrested for possession of marijuana and fined US$1,200. Paul joked the arrest would “make good publicity” for the tour, but this arrest would cause him much trouble trying to gain visas for future tours.
Wings' lineup for the tour was Paul and Linda McCartney, Denny Laine, Henry McCullough, and Denny Seiwell.

List of PBA seasons

This is a list of Philippine Basketball Association seasons.
List of seasons.
Each season is composed of 2 or more conferences; in the PBA where teams are owned by corporations and do not reside in a geographical area, "conferences" are tournaments held during a season.
Winning a conference is considered a greater honor than having the best record in the season; the most prestigious conference is the All-Filipino Cup. If a team wins all three conferences in a single season from 1975-2003 and since2010, or from 2004-10, winning three consecutive championships, the team is said to have won the "Grand Slam" and is a greatest honor a team can achieve in a single season.

Coat of arms of Jamaica

Considered as a legacy from the British with slight modifications, the Jamaican Coat of Arms was granted to Jamaica in 1661 under Royal Warrant. The original was designed by William Sancroft, then Archbishop of Canterbury.
The motto of the seal has been a matter of discussion for years since inception. The original motto, "INDVS VTERQVE SERVIET VNI" is the Latin translation for "The two Indians will serve as one", or rather "Both Indies will serve Together", in reference to the collective servitude of the Taino and Arawak Indians to the colonizers. The motto was replaced in 1962 with the English motto "Out of Many, One People", as tribute to the unity of the different cultural minorities inhabiting the nation. Perhaps as coincidence, the motto has the same meaning as the motto of the United States; "E Pluribus Unum".
Changes in the coat of arms.
The Jamaican coat of arms has seen quite a number of changes, but only three are officially recorded. These changes occurred in 1906, 1957 and 1962.

Misc.
Kasetsart University Lopburi campus is located in Tambon Phaniat, Khok Samrong district.
Wat Khao Wong Phra Chan is a nearby temple located at the highest mountain in Lopburi Province, just south of Khoksamrong. It is 5 km from the main road between Lopburi and Khoksamrong (a motorcycle taxi usually waits at the main road to take visitors for a slightly overpriced fee). The temple is at the foot of the mountain, which can be climbed via a tree-shaded staircase. At the bottom of the mountain is an interesting and unusual museum featuring a wide collection of religious amulets and ornaments, as well as photos, paintings and sculptures. The temple provides a complimentary vegetarian meal (donations recommended) for visitors.
Khoksamrong town has little in the way of tourist attractions, but is a pleasant place to spend a couple of hours. It has quite a few temples, a large and interesting market, along with an evening market on Thursdays by the coach station. Some of Lopburi's finest sunflower fields are on the outskirts of Khoksamrong, however private transport is needed to access them.
Administration.
The district is subdivided into 13 subdistricts ("tambon"), which are further subdivided into 137 villages ("muban"). The township ("thesaban tambon") Khok Samrong covers parts of the "tambon" Khok Samrong. There are further 13 Tambon administrative organizations (TAO). 
Missing numbers are tambon which now form Nong Muang and Khok Charoen district.

Pilar Lorengar

Lorenza Pilar García Seta (January 16, 1928June 2, 1996) was a Spanish (Aragonese) soprano who used the professional name Pilar Lorengar. She was best known for her interpretations of opera and the Spanish genre Zarzuela, and as a soprano she was known for her full register, a youthful timbre as well as a distinctive vibrato.
Pilar was born in the El Gancho district of Zaragoza. At a very young age she participated in a radio program called "Ondas Infantiles", organized by Radio Zaragoza; she began formal music lessons at the age of fourteen under Margarita Martínez. She moved to Barcelona to study at the Barcelona Music Conservatory and began performing "incognito" under the name Loren Arce in various halls in order to pay for her lessons. She studied in Madrid under Spanish lyric soprano Ángeles Otein, and she also studied in West Berlin with Carl Ebert and mezzo-soprano Hertha Klust, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's teacher. 
Pilar became a member of the chorus of the Teatro de la Zarzuela around 1949. She made her professional debut in 1950 in Oran, Algeria, playing the role of Maruxa. In 1951 she made her Spanish debut in the principal role in the Zarzuela "El canastillo de fresas" (The Strawberry Basket). In 1952, she performed as a soloist in Barcelona in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and also in Brahms' "Requiem".
Her international opera career started in 1955 at the Festival international d'Art Lyrique in Aix-en-Provence, where she played Cherubino in "The Marriage of Figaro". She went on to play in London, Glyndebourne and Buenos Aires. In 1958 she signed a contract with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, a relationship that would last for thirty years.

She went on to play Desdemona in "Otello" at the San Francisco Opera, Violetta in "La traviata" at the "Deutsche Oper" in Berlin, and Donna Elvira in "Don Giovanni" at the Metropolitan Opera. Through her career she performed in Madrid, Brussels, La Scala at Milan, Liceu at Barcelona, frequently with the Vienna Philharmonic and the Vienna State Opera, Paris and even as far away as Tokyo.
Her 1985 Zarzuela duet album recorded with Plácido Domingo at the Salzburg Music Festival brought her again to the forefront of Spanish Zarzuela. Her final triumph in Berlin was as Valentine in "Les Huguenots". 
In 1991, the Príncipe de Asturias Foundation awarded the "Generation of Spanish lyric singers" (de los Ángeles, Berganza, Caballé, Carreras, Domingo, Kraus and Lorengar) the Arts award. Pilar announced her retirement and performed her last concert at the Campoamor Theatre in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. In 1994, she was awarded the "Order of Merit" of the State of Berlin.
Pilar Lorengar died of cancer in Berlin, scene of her longest artistic associations, where she resided with her husband, Dr Jurgen Schaff. I.E.S. Pilar Lorengar, a free public vocational high school for the media arts located in her city of birth, Zaragoza, Spain, was named in her honor.

Maximum (comics)

Maximum is a fictional superhero published by DC Comics. He first appeared in "Supermen of America" vol. 2 #1 (March 2000), and was created by Fabian Nicieza and Doug Braithwaite.
Fictional character biography.
Maxwell Williams was a young African-American high school athlete with a bright future ahead of him, but became a quadripelegic after a tragic accident, and would have remained so without specially designed surgical implants provided by LexCorp. The Lexcorp implants made Maxwell more than human and he used his new powers to fight crime in Suicide Slum under the name of Maximum. After Psilencer's untimely death, Outburst and his inexperienced teammates in the Supermen of America were deeply shaken and reconsidered their vocation. It was around this time that the team met and recruited Max. Unlike the rest of the Supermen, Maximum's identity was public record.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/so.html]
A disgruntled Lexcorp employee discovered that S.T.A.R. Labs had hidden a capsule inside a special holding chamber called Lockdown 6 in the waters near Metropolis. Luthor successfully deployed Pyrogen to retrieve the capsule from Lockdown 6, but he encountered the Deep Six and was rebuffed. Darkseid, lord of Apokolips, also wanted the contents of Lockdown 6 and had sent the Deep Six to retrieve them. In the Vega system, the Warlords of Okaara sensed the danger presented by the capsule, and took preventative measures.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/so.html]
The Okaarans overpowered Earth's defensive forces and White Lotus desperately rushed to negotiate a peace settlement before they "cleansed' the planet. While White Lotus was negotiating with the Okaarans in order to save Earth from worse attacks, the chamber was opened and the Unimaginable was unleashed. The Unimaginable's energy form possessed Maximum and he temporarily gained the powers of a god. With these powers, Max decides to transform Metropolis into the paradise he believes it should be, even if it means fighting his own team to do so. The hero known as Loser uses his null field to slow Max down until they can talk him down. Max's parents eventually convinced him to relinquish the power, which he dispersed safely.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/so.html]
