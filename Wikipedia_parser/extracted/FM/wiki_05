Chocolataire

A chocolataire is a type of social gathering which ranges from large events (such as fund raising and invitation only) to smaller functions (similar in structure to informal tea parties), in which all food and drink are composed of or contain some form of chocolate. Considered obsolete by some, this entertainment was at its peak popularity around the turn of the 20th century (the process for making milk chocolate having been brought to market in 1875), and was seen as a novel alternative to the other forms of social gathering at the time.
Food and drink.
The menu at a chocolataire may include any variety of chocolate-based dishes: cakes, wafers, bonbons, candy, and pastry being a few examples thereof. These dishes can also be seasonal. For instance, featuring hot chocolate as the drink of choice in the colder months, and chocolate lemonade in the warmer ones; with chocolate fondue and chocolate ice cream being the seasonal food choices for winter and summer, respectively.
Ceremony.
As the chocolataire grew in popularity, the ceremony itself became more chocolate-themed—the menu cards, programs, decorations, and even the costumes of the waiters were of chocolate color; chocolate cups and saucers were sometimes sold with the chocolate that was served in them, or given as a souvenir for those who purchased chocolate.
The chocolataire saw use in every social gathering imaginable—one was even thrown as part of a fund raising function for a kindergarten in Indiana—and it was not uncommon, after all guests have been served, to hold an auction of remaining candy, loaves of cake, and boxes of chocolate left over from preparation of the dishes.
Modern use.
The modern analog to the traditional chocolataire is found in some bridesmaid and bachelorette parties (where traditional chocolate foods and candies like truffles and cake are joined by newer recipes like chocolate beer and martinis), and restaurants like "Death by Chocolate" in New Zealand and Canada featuring all-chocolate menus.

Claud Woolley

Claud Neville Woolley (5 May 1886 – 3 November 1962) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire. He also served as a first-class umpire and stood in one Test during the 1948 Ashes series. A right-hand batsman and right-arm slow-medium bowler, he is the older brother of Frank who had a more successful playing career including representing England in 64 Tests.
Born in Tonbridge, Woolley began his cricket career with Kent however he failed to break into the first team, making 18 second XI appearances between 1906 and 1908. He joined Gloucestershire but once again failed to establish himself, making just one first-class appearance in two seasons with the club, the appearance came in 1909 against the touring Australians, he opened the bowling but took no wickets in eight overs, he batted at number seven and scored 22. He joined Northamptonshire in 1911, making his debut for the club against the Indian tourists, he scored 1 not out batting at number 10 but did take his maiden first-class wicket, dismissing Mukundrao Pai.
That was Woolley's only appearance in his first season with the club but the following season he was given more opportunities playing ten first-class matches, however he had little success averaging just 10.54 with the bat and taking three wickets. His batting and bowling aggregates improved over the next two seasons, with 670 runs and 15 wickets in 1913 followed by 802 and 28 in 1914. He also scored a maiden century in 1914 against Somerset, and a week later achieved his maiden five-for taking 6 wickets for 31 runs (6/31).
Following World War I Woolley was a regular in the side until 1931, mostly appearing as an opening batsman he passed 1,000 runs in a season on seven occasions between 1921 and 1929. His most productive season came in 1928 when he scored 1,602. His second first-class century came in 1921 and proved to be the highest score of his career and only double century. The innings of 204 not out came against Worcestershire at Northampton. His best bowling of his career also occurred in 1921, against Glamorgan at Cardiff Arms Park, he took 6/30 in the first innings and followed that with 4/22 as the home side followed on. The match figures of 10/52 were the only occasion he took ten wickets in a match.
Woolley's best bowling seasons came directly after the war, he passed 40 wickets in each of the four years between 1919 and 1922, he took nine five-fors in this period. Against Essex in 1920 he took a hat-trick dismissing Charlie McGahey, John Freeman and Percy Perrin with consecutive deliveries.
Woolley played 362 matches for Northamptonshire placing him eighth on the most appearances list, and is the tenth highest scorer for the club with 15,353 runs. He carried his bat on three occasions.
After retiring as a player he began his umpiring career, standing in 281 matches between 1932 and 1953. He umpired one Test match, the second Test of the 1948 Ashes series. During a match between Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire in 1946 Woolley was temporarily required to officiate from both ends as fellow umpire George Beet was taken ill on the way to the game. After Woolley's umpiring career he worked as groundsman at Northampton until his death aged 76.

Amphekepubis

Amphekepubis is a genus of mosasaur from the Late Cretaceous of Mexico. Their remains correspond to the holotype specimen UM VP 509, a partial skeleton preserved in three dimensions, comprising the pelvic area, hind limb bones and nine caudal vertebrae, found in the east of Monterrey, in the state of Nuevo Leon, which come from marine sediments (claystones) apparently from the San Felipe Formation, which corresponds to the boundary between the ages of Coniacian and Santonian in the early Late Cretaceous. However, it has been suggested that age may be more recent and its remains even might belong to the genus "Mosasaurus".

Indian Castle Church

Indian Castle Church is a historic mission church at Indian Castle in Herkimer County, New York. The church is located on NYS Route 5S near present-day Danube. It is a one-story, rectangular wood frame structure, clad in clapboard with a gable roof and steeple. To the rear of the church is a burial ground containing the remains of both Mohawks and Europeans.
It was erected in 1769 by Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as an Indian mission church for the Mohawk nation. They were the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois League, who occupied most of New York west of the Hudson River.
Background.
The land was donated by siblings Joseph and Molly Brant, two prominent Mohawk in their village of "Canajoharie," located on the south side of the Mohawk River. Construction was done under the direction and at the expense of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Molly Brant was a longtime companion and common-law wife of Johnson. Her brother Joseph Brant became a prominent Mohawk military leader, allied with the British, during the American Revolutionary War and later led the Mohawk after their migration to Canada.
The church is located within what is now designated as the Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. It is the only colonial Indian missionary church surviving in New York State. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

David Bressoud

David Marius Bressoud (born March 27, 1950 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) is an American mathematician who works in number theory, combinatorics, and special functions. As of 2012 he is DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics at Macalester College and a former President of the Mathematical Association of America.
Life and education.
Bressoud was born March 27, 1950 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
He became interested in mathematics in the seventh grade, where he had a teacher who encouraged him and gave him challenging problems. He attended Albert Wilansky's National Science Foundation summer program at Lehigh University between his junior and senior years in high school, where he also spent most of his time working on problems.
He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1971. When he started at Swarthmore he had not yet decided on a major, but after his first year he decided to get out of college as quickly as possibly and had no interest in graduate school, and the quickest way out was to major in mathematics.
After graduating Bressoud became a Peace Corps volunteer in Antigua from 1971 to 1973, teaching math and science at Clare Hall School. While in Antigua he realized he missed mathematics, and kept working on it as a hobby. After the Peace Corps he went to graduate school at Temple University, and received his PhD in 1977 under Emil Grosswald.
Career.
After receiving his PhD, Bressoud taught at Pennsylvania State University from 1977 to 1994, reaching the rank of full professor in 1986. During this period he held visiting positions at the Institute for Advanced Study (1979–1980), the University of Wisconsin (1980–81 and 1982), the University of Minnesota (1983 and 1998), and the University of Strasbourg (1984–85).
His focus at Penn State was mathematics research, but in the late 1980s he became more interested in teaching and writing textbooks, and he decided to make a move. He said in a 2008 interview, "I needed to be in a place that had a strong focus on teaching and a community of people for whom
teaching was what they were most interested in." He decided on a move to Macalester College in 1994, where he is now DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics. Since 2005 he has written a monthly online column for MAA titled "Launchings" that focuses on the CUPM (Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics) "Curriculum Guide".
Bressoud received several of the Mathematical Association of America's awards: the Distinguished Teaching Award for the Allegheny Mountain section in 1994,
the Beckenbach Book Prize in 1999,
and he was the George Pólya Lecturer from 2002 to 2004.
Bressoud was elected president of the Mathematical Association of America in the 2007 elections, and served as President-Elect in 2008 and served as President from 2009 to 2011. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Keith and Kevin Schultz

Keith and Kevin Schultz (born September 16, 1953) are American identical twin photographers and former actors. Reportedly making their screen debut as infants, the Schultz brothers are perhaps best known for their roles as brothers Jefferson and Fennimore on the ABC western frontier series "The Monroes", as well as for Kevin's role as Tom Sawyer on the NBC live-action/animated series "The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn". After careers as child actors in front of the camera, the Schultz brothers transitioned to a career working together as professional photographers, best known for their celebrity "head shots" of notable Hollywood child stars.
Early life.
The Schultz brothers were born Keith Sean Schultz and Kevin Edward Schultz on September 16, 1953 in Santa Monica, California to parents Earl and Evelyn Schultz. The brothers grew up in Hollywood with an older sister, Barbara (born c. 1948) and an older brother, Richard (born c. 1951). According to IMDb, the brothers made their screen debut as infants in the feature film "The Long Gray Line", sharing an uncredited role as the infant son of Kitty, played by Betsy Palmer. Throughout their childhood, the brothers continued to work as professional child actors, primarily playing twin roles in various commercials, films and television series.
Career.
Acting.
In 1966, Keith and Kevin landed starring roles on the television series "The Monroes", portraying twin brothers Jefferson "Big Twin" Monroe and Fennimore "Little Twin" Monroe respectively. The series, which also starred Michael Anderson, Jr., Barbara Hershey and Tammy Locke, centered around a frontier family of five orphan siblings as they attempted to make a new life in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Although only lasting one season, the series launched the Schultz brothers as popular child stars of the day and the twins were routinely in demand to make celebrity appearances to meet with young fans across the United States during the height of the show's popularity.
After "The Monroes", the Schultz brothers auditioned for the Hanna-Barbera television series "The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", loosely based on the characters from the Mark Twain novel. Eventually beating out his brother for the role, Kevin co-starred as Tom Sawyer alongside Michael Shea as Huck Finn and LuAnn Haslam as Becky Thatcher, navigating weekly adventures within an animated world as they attempted to outrun a vengeful "Injun Joe", played by Ted Cassidy. All less than a year apart in age, the show's three teenage stars were tutored together for three hours a day on the set between scenes, with each episode reportedly taking approximately four hours to film and six months to animate.
Premiering on NBC on September 16, 1968, "The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" aired in over 15 countries and was the first weekly television series to combine live-action performers with animation. In a departure from the network's usual Saturday morning cartoon schedule, the series aired Sunday nights and made its three young stars popular teen idols of the era. Although another series that lasted only one season, the show continued to air in reruns as part of "The Banana Splits" syndication package, becoming well known to subsequent generations for the next four decades.
In addition to "The Monroes" and "The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", the Schultz brothers continued to appear in various other film and television roles, with Keith guest-starring on such television series as "Gunsmoke", "The Flying Nun" and "Cannon", and Kevin guest-starring on such television series as "The Iron Horse", "Lucas Tanner", and "Eight is Enough", as well as appearing in the feature film "Big Wednesday". Keith and Kevin's final appearance would be together as brothers Ken and K.C. Zeigler on the Showtime comedy series "Brothers" in the episode titled "Two-Timin' Man" which aired August 6, 1986.
Music.
In 1967, following the notoriety they'd achieved on "The Monroes", the Schultz brothers embarked on a music career, forming their own four-piece musical group "The Monroe Doctrine" with Greg Reinhardt and their elder brother Ric Schultz. Keith played rhythm guitar and Kevin played bass while both sang harmony to Ric's lead vocals. By 1970, the group was known as "Keith, Kevin & Air" and featured the twins performing songs written by their brother Ric, as well as other group members, Brad Driver, Keith Fogel, Tim Henderson and Jim Purvis. In 1970, Keith, Kevin & Air signed a record deal with Pzazz Records and released a 7" single which included the songs "Euphoria" and "Michael's Theme".
Photography.
Following their show business careers in front of the camera, the Schultz brothers transitioned to a joint career behind the camera as celebrity photographers. According to their website SchultzBrosPhoto.com, the brothers had developed a passion for photography while working as child actors in Hollywood. Keith is the photographer of the team while Kevin handles the lighting, retouching and restoration elements. After 30 years of experience, the brothers are perhaps best known for their celebrity "head shots" of such child stars as Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Raven-Symoné and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, among others.
Personal life.
As teenagers, the Schultz twins garnered a significant amount of attention from the teen magazines of the late-1960s and were said to have shared many of the same interests and ambitions. At the time, the brothers' interests reportedly included swimming, fishing, baseball and football, as well as watching their favorite television show, "The Avengers" and listening to records by their favorite singing group, "The Byrds".

He made his own amber-brown, lustrous varnish. Among his notable violins were a dozen violins each named after one of the twelve apostles. Other instruments were named after George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Most of his violins were patterened after Stradivarius, notably the Alard Stradivarius. The tonal quality of Squier's violins was brilliant and clear. Squier taught the art of violin making to Charles Kinney, father of Edward Kinney. In 2007, one of Squier's violins had an estimated worth of US$100,000 because of its tonal quality.
Squier married Olive Brown Raymond and the couple had three children. One of their children, Victor Carrol Squier, also went on to work in violin-making and became renowned for his violins and violin strings.

Peter Dicken

Peter Dicken (born 1938) is an economic geographer whose research is primarily focused on the processes and patterns associated with globalisation. He has been quoted as a true ‘Manchester man’ joining the University of Manchester in 1966 following the successful completion of his MA from the same institution. He is currently an Emeritus Professor at the same university which he has dedicated his academic life to, continuing his research on global patterns of business and globalisation. His self-described area of research is:
‘the changing multi-scalar geographies of the global economy and on the structures and dynamics of global production networks, particularly the relationships between transnational corporations and states’.
Career.
Throughout his career Peter Dicken has been involved in the following positions:
More specifically, Dickens research areas have involved:
Awards.
He was awarded a personal chair in 1988 – an award in recognition his high levels of achievements and standing the research of economic geographies – enabling him professor status. Dicken was awarded the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in 2001 for 'advancing research on globalization and economic geography'. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in 2002. He was also awarded the Centenary Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2007 for 'distinguished contribution to the study of the geographies of the global economy'.
Contribution and Legacy.
Peter Dicken’s key text ‘Global shift’ is regarded by some as a ‘bible of globalisation’ due to its encyclopaedic nature and because of this, it has sold many tens of thousands of copies over the last 30 years and is his best known and most widely cited work. He has been described as ‘one of the most influential economic geographers in the discipline over the last 30 years’.
Dicken’s fairly uncontroversial approach towards his research is one reason his works remain so popular within the discipline. He was amongst the first to point out the significance of TNCs, providing detailed analysis of their role in the world economy – explaining how they are a barometer for global economic change.
Dicken provided a greater understanding of chains and network structures - in particular by understanding the role, locational behaviour and organisation of Japanese capital and firms in Western economies. His work on the economic restructuring of Japanese firms regarding the Just-In-Time production process is widely cited. Through his work, he was able to explain global economic change in relation to global-local dialect.

The transitional coordinator is a professional coaching position relatively new to the NFL, but applied in European clubs for nearly half a century. 
Originally, the coach was merely a public relations buffer between the public and the athletes, but recently their job has been expanded to include directing the players between the bench and huddle, as well as the mini-display shown during the beginning of the game where the players look up from the ground to the screen, and then smile. However, the transitional coordinator position has seen its fair share of controversy.
John Madden has gone as far as saying that the transitional coordinator is "one of the most important coaching positions in the NFL today, perhaps even eclipsing the Head Coach and Defensive Coordinators in many situations."

Kolpos

The kolpos (Greek: κόλποις κόλπον κόλπῳ, a gulf, bay or creek) is the blousing of a peplos, chiton or tunic in Ancient Greek clothing, whereby excess length of the material hangs folded over a zone (a narrow girdle).
The fabric of the garment was typically cut longer than the shoulder-to-floor measurement of the women or man wearing it. The excess length was dealt with at the waist (creating the kolpos) and optionally the top edge (creating the apoptygma). To create the kolpos, a zone was tied around the body below the breast (high-girdled) or at the waist (low-girdled) and excess fabric was pulled up over it. The fabric fell over the girdle so as to hide it, and was often pulled longer in back than in front. This fold was the kolpos. A second (visible) zone could be tied over the kolpos to redefine the waist, high or low. This might be hidden again by the apoptygma, the loose, folded down top of the peplos.

Larry Drew II (born March 5, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Sioux Falls Skyforce in the NBA Development League (D-League). He won the John R. Wooden High School Player of the Year Award in 2008 before starting his college basketball career with the North Carolina Tar Heels. Drew won a national championship in 2009 with the Tar Heels before deciding to leave the program in 2011. He transferred to the UCLA Bruins' program, where he played one season. He set UCLA's single-season record for assists and was named to the All-Pac-12 first team.
Early life.
Drew is the son of Larry Drew, who was a first-round draft pick in the 1980 National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft before becoming a head coach in the league. At William Howard Taft High School, Drew won the John R. Wooden High School Player of the Year Award as the 2008 Los Angeles City Section Player of the year and was a 2008 "Parade" All-American. He participated in the 2008 McDonald's All-American Game, where he won the 3-point shooting contest.
College career.
North Carolina.
Drew started his collegiate career at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In his freshman year, Drew averaged 1.4 points, 1.9 assists, 1.2 turnovers, and 1.1 rebounds in 9.6 minutes per game as the Tar Heels won the 2009 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I championship. He earned a spot as the starting point guard as a sophomore, replacing Ty Lawson who was drafted by the NBA's Denver Nuggets, and had an up and down season as the Tar Heels struggled to a 20-17 overall record and failed to reach the NCAA tournament, but did advance to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship game. For the season he averaged 8.5 points per game on just 40.2% shooting from the field, six assists and 2.1 turnovers per game.
On February 3, 2011, he left the University of North Carolina's basketball program in the middle of the season. In his last game with the Tar Heels, he had nine assists in 19 minutes in a 106–74 victory over Boston College. He did not cite any reasons, but his playing time, scoring, and assist numbers were all down from the prior season, and freshman Kendall Marshall had taken over the starting point guard job in mid-January. However, in a freestyle rap in March on his 21st birthday, Drew rapped, "The past three years I can't undo, so now I'm making all the moves that I want to ... They tried to tell me just to play my role, but who's really trying to stick to a script that's full of typos?"
UCLA.
Drew started attending classes at UCLA on March 28, and had to sit out the 2011–12 season before using his final season of eligibility. Drew joined former Tar Heel twins, David and Travis Wear, who also transferred to UCLA.
Drew began the 2012–13 season as the Bruins lone senior player. He was also their only true point guard, a position he shared with freshman Kyle Anderson. In the final game of the regular season, Drew broke Pooh Richardson's school record for most assists in a season. Drew was named to the All-Pac-12 first team.
Pro career.
After going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Drew was signed by the Miami Heat on September 23, 2013. He played in one preseason game before being waived on October 21.
On October 31, 2013, he was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Samson (locomotive)

The Samson is an English-built railroad steam locomotive made in 1838 that ran on the Albion Mines Railway in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, Nova Scotia and is the oldest locomotive in Canada.
Construction.
The locomotive was built in 1838 by Timothy Hackworth at his Soho Works in Durham, England. Samson represents an early design of steam locomotive with a return-flue boiler. The fireman and engineer worked separately on open platforms at either end of the locomotive. It was commissioned for the General Mining Association along with two other locomotives, "Hercules" and "John Buddle" for the Albion Mines Railway to serve mines in Pictou County, Nova Scotia.
Arrival.
The locomotives arrived unassembled aboard the brig "Ythan" in May 1839. Two engineers arrived with the locomotives, including George Davidson, who helped build the locomotives in England and would settle in Nova Scotia to work with Samson for the rest of his career. The new railway officially opened with a large celebration on September 19, 1839, although the tracks were not actually completed to the coal pier until May 1840.
Career.
Samson served from 1839 to 1867 carrying coal on the six-mile line from the mines around Stellarton and New Glasgow to the East River loading pier. It proved a strong and reliable locomotive, considered "slow but of great power" by railway workers of the day. One former engineer recalled how it moved a heavy string of coal cars from a crooked siding on a wet day when a more modern locomotive failed to move them. In addition to its regular duties moving coal cars, Samson also saw service carrying passengers in an early design of a passenger coach. The locomotive was semi-retired in 1867 but continued to operate when necessary until 1885. It was sent to Chicago to the National Exhibition of Railway Appliances in 1883.
Preservation.
Samson languished on a scrapline until 1893 when it was displayed at the Chicago World’s Fair as an antique, and acquired along with one of its passenger coaches by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad where it was preserved. In 1927 Samson was returned to Nova Scotia. The passenger coach stayed behind and may be seen today at the B&O Railroad Museum. Samson was displayed beside the Halifax train station until 1950 when the locomotive was moved to New Glasgow. Today it is displayed in the Age of Steam Gallery at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, part of the Nova Scotia Museum system where it is restored to its appearance at the end of its working life. A careful survey of the structure of the locomotive before restoration found it remarkably well preserved, retaining 90% of its end of service parts. Examination of the parts show various repairs and evolutionary modifications which were added to the original Hackworth assembly by the shops of the Albion Mines Railway during the locomotive's long working career. A small number of parts such as the steel tires were added by the B & O railroad museum after the locomotive retired.
Significance.
Samson was the first locomotive in Canada to run on iron rails. It is the oldest surviving locomotive in Canada, one of the oldest in North America and the second of only two surviving locomotives built by engineer Timothy Hackworth (the other being "Sans Pareil").

Love, Peace & Money (also Love Peace & Money; Japanese 愛、平和、そして金) is the first English-language album by the German punk band Die Toten Hosen (ディ・トーテン・ホゼン ["di tooten hoozen"] in katakana; DTH), not counting the cover album "Learning English, Lesson One". It was intended for the Japanese market. Most of the songs are just English versions of other DTH songs.
For the cover, the idea of "Reich & sexy" was copied. However, the band was unable to find enough Japanese women willing to undress for the cover, so some of the women are just made to look Japanese.[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/en/veroeffentlichungen_backkatalog_remastered_love_peace_and_money.php]
The reason behind the album was that since the band was also famous outside German speaking countries, they wanted everybody to understand what they have to say. They were especially inspired by Argentinian fans, of whom some have started learning German just to understand DTH's lyrics.[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/en/veroeffentlichungen_backkatalog_remastered_love_peace_and_money.php]

40 Days and 40 Nights: Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities on Trial in Pennsylvania is a 2007 non fiction book about the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial of 2005. Author Matthew Chapman, a journalist, screenwriter and director (and the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin) reported on the trial for Harper's magazine.
Reception.
Austin Cline of "About.com" gave the book four-and-a-half-stars-out-of-five rating, stating: "There are bound to be many books written about this trial and I don't know if Chapman's will be the best source of information — either about the trial itself or the larger issues involved. It will, however, almost certainly stand out as one of the most enjoyable and entertaining to read."
John Dupuis of "ScienceBlogs" gave the book a positive review, saying that "Chapman uses some of the same strategies in the Dover as he did in the first book on the Scopes Trial. He tells the story of the trial as a story about people: the lawyers, the defendants, the townspeople, the media. And a colourful lot they were, making those aspects of the book very entertaining and compelling. The weakness of the book is related to those colourful characters — the chronicle of the trial itself never really seemed to come alive for me in the same way that his telling of the Scopes trial did."

Lombank Trophy

The Lombank Trophy was a non-championship Formula One race held during the early 1960s at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit in Norfolk, England.
The event took place early in the season and was sometimes the first Formula One race of the year. The 1961 race was the first event in Europe to be run according to the new 1.5-litre regulations for Formula One.
After the event was dropped from the Formula One calendar, the Lombank Trophy was held for Formula 3 cars at Brands Hatch Circuit in Kent in 1965. This race was marred by the fatal accident suffered by George Crossman. Later in the 1960s, it was run as a Formula Libre event at Ingliston.
Lombank, part of the Lombard North Central finance company, also sponsored the British Formula Three Championship in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Under the Lombard name, the company also sponsored the RAC Rally for many years until the 1990s.

Some Pea people ran as far to Malapo and stayed there, some ran and settled at Tatakamotonga and Vaini. When the rest of the people of Pea still ran, they got tired and weary. They stopped, turned, and hid in the bush.
That place was named Holonga. "Holo" means escaped and "nga" means cry.

University of Santo Tomas College of Rehabilitation Sciences

The University of Santo Tomas College of Rehabilitation Sciences, popularly known as "UST-CRS", is the rehabilitation sciences school of the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest and the largest Catholic university in Manila, Philippines.
It is a consistent Top Performing Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy School in the Philippine Physical Therapist Licensure Examinations and the Philippine Occupational Therapist Licensure Examinations respectively.
Objectives.
The main objective of the College of Rehabilitation Sciences is to develop Christian allied rehabilitation professionals who are fully competent in utilizing selected knowledge and skills in planning, organizing, directing and implementing programs for the care of individuals whose ability to function is impaired or threatened by disease or injury.
History.
In the early 70's the lack of manpower to care for million disabled Filipino was staggering. There were less than 50 qualified licensed Physical Therapists in the country, out of an estimated need for at least 3000.
To address this need, the UST Institute of Physical Therapy opened its doors in June 1974 to applicants for the course of Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy. At that time, the first two years of the four-year baccalaureate degree fell under the College of Science while the last two years were administered under the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. The first batch of 14 students graduated in 1977.
By March 1987, the school was granted a semi-autonomous status academically while still functioning administratively under the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. It exercised full control of the revised 5-year curriculum that was initiated in school year 1988-89.
On December 15, 1993, the school was granted full autonomy academically and administratively by then Rector, Very Reverend Fr. Rolando dela Rosa, O.P. The head of the Institute was likewise elevated from being a Director to a Dean.
In fulfillment of its commitment to develop allied rehabilitation professionals, the degree of BS in Occupational Therapy was also offered.
Also offered was a postgraduate certificate course, an intensive 8 week seminar-workshop which aims to spur the professionalization of sports science in the country.
The Institute has grown tremendously for the past twenty five years. Presently the entire student population is 600, about forty five times more than the original number of enrolees. The facilities of the school is by far the most sophisticated and most complete in the country and is at par with those found abroad.

Vermont Energy Investment Corporation

Vermont Energy Investment Corporation or VEIC is a non-profit organization in Chittenden County, Vermont that seeks to reduce the economic and environmental costs of energy consumption through energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption. Since its founding in 1986, the organization has been involved in designing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in North America and worldwide.
VEIC also operates three large-scale energy efficiency programs in the United States, including Efficiency Vermont, the nation’s first statewide energy efficiency utility.
History.
VEIC was founded in 1986 by Beth Sachs and Blair Hamilton with a goal to reduce energy costs for consumers by promoting energy efficiency and encouraging the conservation of natural resources. In particular, they focused their early efforts on helping reduce the burden of energy costs for low income consumers. By 1997, VEIC had implemented energy efficiency measures in nearly 100 low-income multifamily buildings throughout the state of Vermont; it also led a successful effort to establish an ordinance requiring landlords in the city of Burlington to meet a minimum efficiency standard before their buildings could be sold to new owners. Through a partnership with the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VEIC also helped to establish financing programs and a home energy rating system to help low-income and first-time homebuyers avoid being burdened with high energy costs. 
In 2000, VEIC won a competitive contract to operate Efficiency Vermont, the first statewide energy efficiency utility in the nation. Efficiency Vermont has been credited as an effective program:
In 2007, VEIC established a 20-year goal to offset twice the amount of greenhouse gas emissions projected to be emitted in Vermont in the year 2027. 
Over the course of 2010-2011, VEIC won competitive contracts to start up and begin operation of additional large-scale energy efficiency programs based in Ohio and Washington, D.C. Efficiency Smart, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a program of energy efficiency services offered to a network of public power companies that are members of American Municipal Power, Incorporated (AMP). VEIC operates Efficiency Smart under contract to AMP and has designed the program to save 70,000 megawatt-hours of electricity over the course of its first three years in operation. The District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility (DC SEU) is operated under contract to the District Department of the Environment in Washington, D.C. The DC SEU contract is held by the Sustainable Energy Partnership, with VEIC serving as the partnership lead. 
In February 2012, VEIC, The Clark Group, and Vermont Law School were awarded a $34 million blanket purchase agreement to help the Environmental Protection Agency improve energy efficiency for commercial, institutional, and industrial customers throughout the U.S. 
At a 2012 U.S. Senate forum on jobs, Scott Johnstone, the Executive Director of VEIC, reported that the organization continues to grow, despite the economic recession that began in 2008. According to his statement, from 2005-2012 VEIC increased its number of employees by 130%, and its revenues grew by 286%. 
VEIC is also an active resource on transportation efficiency. It is facilitating the state of Vermont’s participation in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s “Project Get Ready” program, which is working to prepare for the electrification of the transportation system. It is also conducting research on least-cost transportation strategies, and best practices for applying energy efficiency principles to travel behavior and consumer purchase decisions in the transportation sector.

Hot stain

A hot stain is a region of the world where safe drinking water has been depleted. The term may have been coined by Goldman Environmental Prize winning hydrologist Michal Kravcik. Hot stains can be found on every continent, except for Antarctica. The biggest reason for a hot stain to develop is population pressure. As the population grows, water demand increases.
Maude Barlow an environmental activist, head of the Council of Canadians, and founder of the Blue Planet Project has used the term 'hot stain' in regard to water resources. In 2005, Maude Barlow received Sweden's Right Livelihood Award.
Water resources.
'Hot stains' areas are one term given where water reserves are disappearing. These areas include the Middle East, Northern China, Mexico, California and almost two dozen countries in Africa. Today thirty-one countries and over 1 billion people completely lack access to clean water. The global freshwater crisis looms as one of the greatest threats ever to the survival of our planet according to Maude Barlow and Tony Clarke (activist) in an article in The Nation magazine.

Ub-AMC

Ubiquitin-AMC is a fluorogenic substrate for a wide range of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs). It is a particularly useful reagent for the study of deubiquitinating activity where detection sensitivity or continuous monitoring of activity is essential.
Background.
Ubiquitin-AMC is prepared by the C-terminal derivatization of ubiquitin with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin and has been shown to be a useful and sensitive fluorogenic substrate for wide range of deubiquitinylating enzymes (DUBs), including ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs).
Ubiquitin-AMC has been shown to be a sensitive substrate for UCH-L3 (Km = 0.039µM) (Product code UW9745) and for Isopeptidase-T (Km = 0.17-1.4µM) (Product code UW9690), and is particularly useful for studying deubiquitinylating activity where detection sensitivity or continuous monitoring of activity is essential.
Typical assay set-up: Assay substrate concentration: 0.01-1.0µM. Enzyme concentrations, UCH-L3: 10-100pM, isopeptidase-T: 10-100nM. Release of AMC fluorescence by DUB enzymes can be monitored using 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths.

Christopher Hollis

Maurice Christopher Hollis, known as Christopher Hollis (2 December 1902 – 5 May 1977) was a British schoolmaster, university teacher, author and Conservative politician.
Life.
Hollis was born at Wells, Somerset, in 1902, one of the four sons of George Arthur Hollis (1868–1944), vice-principal of the Wells Theological College and later Bishop of Taunton. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was president of the Oxford Union Society. He travelled as a member of the Union's debating team to the United States, New Zealand and Australia. He was a friend of Ronald Knox and Evelyn Waugh and in 1924 converted to Roman Catholicism, as Knox had already done and as Waugh did later.
For ten years from 1925 he taught history at Stonyhurst College, then from 1935 to 1939 was a visiting professor of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, where he carried out economic research.
At the beginning of the Second World War, Hollis returned home and served throughout the war as a Royal Air Force intelligence officer.
Immediately after the war, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Devizes in Wiltshire and held the seat until he retired undefeated in 1955. While in the House of Commons, he showed an independent spirit, for example by supporting the abolition of capital punishment while that was not his party's general view, and was popular on all sides. When he left the Commons (to be succeeded by another Conservative, Percivall Pott) he became a parliamentary commentator for "Punch" and retired to Mells, near Frome in Somerset, where he spent his time in writing books and journalism and in supporting Somerset County Cricket Club and other local interests. He was also a member of the publishing firm Hollis and Carter, a subsidiary of Burns and Oates. In 1957 he briefly revisited Australia, in association with the Congress for Cultural Freedom.
Hollis wrote books and articles on a variety of historical and political subjects. His last book, "Oxford in the Twenties" (1976) is about his wide circle of friends, including Evelyn Waugh, Maurice Bowra, Harold Acton, Leslie Hore-Belisha, and the cricketer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow.
Family.
In 1929, Hollis married Madeleine King, daughter of the Rev. Richard King, Rector of Cholderton, and herself also a Roman Catholic convert, and they had one daughter and three sons, including Crispian Hollis, Bishop of Portsmouth.
He was the brother of Sir Roger Hollis and the uncle of Adrian Hollis.

Treffgarne

Treffgarne is a small village in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales.
Location & History.
It lies to the south of the Preseli Hills. The village name is derived from 'tref' meaning town and 'garne' meaning rock, or the 'town of the rock'. The rock in this case is the locally infamous Treffgarne Rocks, a series of ancient Ordovician rhyolite volcanic plugs, now exposed, that form the Roche Rhyolite Group. A number of interesting minerals have been recorded including Brookite crystals (Titanium dioxide) and possibly tin. Small regular cavities can be found in the rocks where crystals of at least 1 cm width once resided. Gold has also been found at the rocks from drillcores and placer gold in the local Eastern Cleddau below the village. There is also an old legend of old gold workings near Treffgarne (possibly towards the farm Mount Pleasant) from the Roman period. Roman activity is certainly attested in the region with at least two Romano-British settlements nearby at Ambleston (Castle Flemming) and Wolfscastle and a possible extension of the Roman road from Carmarthen into Pembrokeshire.
The site of the village itself goes back to at least the medieval period. Evidence for this is in the form of a nearby medieval strip lynchet field system to the north of the village and a suggestion that the current church sits on the site of a medieval monastery. 
Until the 1970s the village was quite small with no more than 120 inhabitants but has since grown with the development of a modern estate to the west of the church. Close to the village to the west is Treffgarne Hall, erected in 1842 by Dr. Evans. It was converted into a restaurant in 1979 by executive chef, Derek Stenson and his partner John Neville, former sous chef at the Dorchester Hotel, but this endeavour did not last. 
Close to the village to the north east is the disused Treffgarne Quarry which provided roadstone.

Ramdwara

Ramdwara (Devanagari रामद्वारा) means "the doorway to the RAM". It is a place of worship for the people who believe in Ramsnehi Sampradaya, which advocates chanting of 'Ram' (राम). Ramsnehi means "People who love God". Their way of worshipping God is simple. People of all faiths, castes, sections etc. visit at the Ramdwaras.
Origin of Ramsnehi.
Ramsnehi Sampradaya is a spiritual and religious tradition originating in 1817 Vikram Samwat in Bhilwara city of Rajasthan by the disciple of Swami Shri Ram Charan Maharaj who provided the spiritual and philosophical basis for the sect.
In present time, "Ramsnehi Sampradaya" has four major monasteries. All are in Rajashtan State of India. They are in the following cities:
Smaller Ramdwara centres are located at various places in states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi.
Swami Ji Shree Ram Charan Ji Maharaj came to Shahpura from Bhilwara and did Tapasya (deep meditation).
At the place where Swami Ram Charan Ji Maharaj's body was cremated, a giant Ramdwara has been built. This is now the chief Ramdwara of "Ramsnehi Sampradaya".
This Ramdwara is also called Ram Niwas Dhaam or Ram Niwas Baikunth Dhaam.
Construction.
The Shahpura Ramdwara was sponsored by the then King of Shahpura, Maharaja Amar Singh, and his brother Chattra Singh.
It was built by constructors named Jarror Khan and Kushal Khan. This is also a great example of the brotherhood of Hindus and Muslims in India.
All the marble stones used in construction were sourced from a place near the north border of nearby village named "Kanti".
There is a speciality in all used marble stones that each marble stone has a picture and stone mark on it as of Hindi (Devnagari) alphabets of the construction of word "Ram" (Lord Ram), bow, saint, India's map, sword, lion, monkey and other natural pictures.
The main (and base) structure of Shahpura Ramdwara is an octagon shaped shiny marble pillar which is about 12 feet long. This pillar is situated at the cremation place of Ram Charan Maharaj. This pillar is called the Samadhi Stambh.
The floor above the pillar is called Baradari (a kind of summer house with several open marble gates ). A rectangular stone is placed in the center of Baradari which is just over the main pillar.
The Baradari has 108 small pillars which make 84 open gates.
The construction was done in different phases.
Monks of Ramdwara.
The monks of "RamSnehi Sampradaya" are identical by their dressing code. They wear a robe coloured a very light pink. After taking oaths, monks can not return to their family and must treat the whole world equally and fairly, without any prejudices. They are supposed to follow all the defined rules strictly.
Way of worship and belief.
Ramsnehis believe in the name of God (Ram राम) and do not believe in idolatry. A Ramsnehi only follows the simple and easily defined rules. Ramsnehis just do Darshan of the chair of current Acharya and monks. They pay respects to all the previous (departed) acharyas and saints as well.
Ramsnehis remember the name राम (Ram, a name of the Lord). Three main pillars of the ideology are:
Spiritual succession (leaders) in Ramsnehi Sampradaya.
The following are the Acharyas who successively led the Ramsnehi Sampradaya after Swami Ji Shri Ramcharan Ji Maharaj:
Swami Ji Shri 1008 Shree Ram Dayal Ji Maharaj is the present Acharya.
References.
"Ram Rahasya Darshan" is a small compilation of Swami Ram Charan Ji's works, prepared by the late Sant Shree LakshyaRamJi.

<doc id="21359791" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21359791" title="Excess supply">
Excess supply

"For the opposite, see excess demand."
In economics, excess supply (also called surplus) is a situation in which the quantity of a good or service supplied is more than the quantity demanded, and the price is above the equilibrium level determined by supply and demand. That is, the quantity of the product that producers wish to sell exceeds the quantity that potential buyers are willing to buy at the prevailing price. It is the opposite of economic shortage. 
In cultural evolution, agricultural surplus in the Neolithic period is theorized to have produced a greater division of labor, resulting in social stratification and class.
Prices.
Prices and the occurrence excess supply illustrate a strong correlation. When the price of a good is set too high, the quantity of the product demanded will be diminished while the quantity supplied will be enhanced, so there is more quantity supplied than quantity demanded. The occurrence of excess supply either leads to the lowering of the price or unsold supply, the latter reflecting excess supply. Lowering the price of a good encourages consumers to purchase more and suppliers to produce less.
Disequilibrium.
A disequilibrium occurs due to a non-equilibrium price giving a lack of balance between supply and demand. Excess supply is one of the two types of disequilibrium in a perfectly competitive market, excess demand being the other. When quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, the equilibrium level does not obtain and instead the market is in disequilibrium. An excess supply prevents the economy from operating efficiently.
Market response to excess supply.
Excess supply in a perfectly competitive market is the "extra" amount of supply, beyond the quantity demanded. As an example, suppose the price of a television is $600, the quantity supplied at that price is 1000 televisions, and the quantity demanded is 300 televisions. This illustrates that sellers are seeking to sell 700 more televisions than buyers are willing to purchase. Hence, an excess supply of 700 televisions exists, indicating that the market is in a state of disequilibrium. 
In this situation, producers would not be able to sell all the televisions they produce at the price of $600. This will induce them to reduce their price in order to make the product more attractive for the buyers. In response to the reduction in the price of the product, consumers will increase their quantity demanded and producers will not produce as many as before. The market will eventually become balanced as the market is transitioning to an equilibrium price and quantity.

Eri silk

Eri Silk () comes from the worm "Samia cynthia ricini", found in North East of India and some parts of China and Japan. The name Eri is derived from the Assamese word ‘era’, which means castor as the silkworm feeds on castor plants. One of the common names, the 'Ailanthus Silk moth', refers to the host plant. Eri silk is also known as endi or errandi in India. The wooly white silk is often referred to as the Ahimsa silk or the fabric of peace as the process does not involve the killing of the silk worm. Moths leave the cocoon as soon as it is ready to be spun. The eri silk worm is the only completely domesticated silkworm other than "Bombyx mori".
Process.
Eri caterpillars eat a number of plants, including kesseru. It is grown in the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some small villages in other states. The heavy rainfall and humid atmosphere of the region suits the Eri culture. The spun threads are often more "cottony" than most "Bombyx" silks, although some Eri yarns can be very soft and shiny.
After 30-32 days, the silk worm crawls in search of a comfortable place among the leaves to spin its cocoon.
Qualities.
Eri silk is a staple fiber, unlike other silks, which are continuous filament. The texture of the fabric is coarse, fine and dense. It is very strong, durable and elastic. Eri silk is darker and heavier than other silks and blends well with wools and cotton. Due to its thermal property it is warm in winter and cool in summer.
Uses of Eri Silk Fabric.
Eri silk fabric is a boon for those who practice absolute non-violence, not using any product obtained by killing any animal. Eri silk is also said to be a poor person’s silk as it is not as high priced as other silk types. It is widely used by everyone in the regions in which it is produced. It is becoming popular the world over. Vegans and Buddhist monks in India, Bhutan, Nepal, China, and Japan prefer this silk, due to non-violence.
In India, eri was mostly used for the preparation of winter shawls for men and women. The thermal property of eri silk makes it a suitable fabric for shawls, jackets, blankets, bed spreads. Dress materials and baby dresses are also made from Eri silk fabric, because of its soft texture and moisture absorbent quality. Nowadays very fine (up to 210-nm) eri spun yarns are available, which enables weavers to weave very fine clothing, including traditional sari dress materials.
Eri silk is durable and strong and has a typical texture; hence, it is widely used in home furnishing like curtains, bed covers, cushion covers, wall hangings, quilts, etc. The wooly feel adds to the comfort.
Two eri spun-silk mills have been established in Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh and Kokrajhar in Assam while another is at Chaygaon, near Guwahati, Assam, which is spinning the finest Eri spun-silk yarn with various blends with bamboo, muga silk, cotton etc.
The silk products are being promoted as eco-friendly and natural, and should also provide more jobs and money for the tribal peoples that primarily practice eri culture. 
Eri silk production in India during 2007-2008 was 1,530 tons. This made up 73% of the total wild silk production of 2,075 tons.

<doc id="21359960" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21359960" title="Basis Nord">
Basis Nord

Basis Nord was a secret naval base of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" in Zapadnaya Litsa Bay, west of Murmansk provided by the Soviet Union. The base was part of a partnership that developed between Germany and the Soviet Union following German-Soviet Non-Aggression treaty of 1939, along with a broad economic agreement of 1940.
In 1939, the Soviet Union agreed to supply the base location to Germany for the purpose of supporting U-boats and commerce raiding. Germany sent supply ships that were anchored in the bay, but the base was never used by Kriegsmarine fighting vessels. Germany's April 1940 invasion of Norway thereafter rendered the base unnecessary.
In 2008, Basis Nord featured in a prominent BBC-PBS investigative history series, "", and a book of the same name by Laurence Rees in 2009.
Background.
During the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations with both a British–French group and Germany regarding potential military and political agreements, the Soviet Union chose Germany, resulting in an August 19 German–Soviet Trade Agreement providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials and the August 23 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which contained secret protocols dividing the states of Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet "spheres of influence."
One week after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's signing, the partition of Poland commenced with the German invasion of western Poland, followed by the Soviet Union's invasion of Eastern Poland on September 17, which included coordination with German forces.
Negotiations.
The Soviets had also concluded that one of Germany's principal failures in World War I was their lack of free ocean access. Germany had failed in World War I to break out of the so-called "Wet Triangle" of the North Sea. 
Base establishment discussions.
In late 1939, both countries began discussions of creating a larger economic agreement than the 1939 German–Soviet Trade Agreement. From the start of those negotiations, the Soviet Union made clear that it was willing to exchange its strategic maritime position for technology. The Soviets were willing to provide a northern base to the Germans, but not a busy seaport because it would provide an open indication of Soviet assistance of Germany, indicating that it was a co-belligerent.
In October, the Soviets initially offered to provide a base to the west of Murmansk, which the Germans noted lacked anchorage shelter and facilities. The Soviets modified the offer to then undeveloped Zapadnaya Litsa, in the Motovsky Gulf on the Litsa Fjord at the westernmost point of the Kola Peninsula, which the Germans accepted.
Base Operations.
Need for secrecy.
While it made secret agreements with Germany for territorial division and military aid, the Soviet Union attempted to maintain a thin cloak of neutrality. As such, several options for the Soviet supply of German raiding ships that operated at the edge of international law were considered, such as having the German ships feign the capture of Soviet supply vessels as a "prize" (and then releasing them after the Germans retrieved supplies) or placing supplies at a transshipment point where the Germans would later retrieve them.
The base at Zapadnaya Litsa, called "Basis Nord", had advantages with regard to secrecy. It was surrounded by Russian territory and closed to all foreign and Soviet domestic shipping, so that no one could see operations taking place. Its entrance also prevented observation from the open sea.
Initial base conditions.
Germany knew that overt German fortification of Basis Nord was a political impossibility. The base at that time was entirely undeveloped, with no communications by rail or road and lacked access to potable water. Murmansk (120 kilometers away) had access to White Sea-Baltic Canal, but when the Germans arrived, Murmansk had not yet been developed and Gulag forced labor was still present constructing Soviet facilities.
Germany initially procured the necessary supplies for its U-boats to use at the base and sent them first to Murmansk. It used the merchant ships "Cordillera" (12,055 grt), "Phoenicia" (4124 grt) and the "Sachsenwald" (650 grt) for these purposes. All three ships had been interned at Murmansk since the beginning of the war. The "Cordillera" returned to Murmansk almost immediately in December 1939, and then traveled to Hamburg in February 1940.
The Soviet Union's Arctic Fleet Command was informed by Moscow that the Germans were to be able to use the base to support their blockade of the British Isles. However, British submarine HMS "Salmon" sank "U-36", the initial submarine Germany sent to scout Basis Nord, in the Norwegian Sea, though the British did not know "U-36" mission. "U-38" later accomplished the scouting task despite the interference by the Soviet torpedo boats and coast guard ships.
Rumors.
In December 1939, western European media began to publish reported rumors of a northern German submarine base operating in the Soviet Union. Danish newspaper "Nationaltidende", French magazine "Paris Soir" and a French radio station reported rumors of a German submarine base, though they incorrectly identified the location. Germany dismissed the reports as unfounded rumors. Similar rumors surfaced in March 1940 in the "Stockholm Daily Press".
Invasion of Norway.
In April 1940, Germany invaded Norway to attain a base for naval raiding in the North Atlantic, and to secure shipments of iron-ore from Sweden through the port of Narvik. Although the ships used were not launched from Basis Nord, the supply ship "Jan Wellem", important for Narvik operations was sent from Basis Nord. No German U-boats or surface warships were supplied out of Basis Nord.
On May 1, 1940, the Soviets provided a better anchorage point for Basis Nord at nearby Iokanga Bay. However, the German capture of Norway decreased the need for operations at Basis Nord, and it became more important as a symbol of cooperation than a base for significant operation. In April 1940, the Soviet Union withdrew its promises given with regard to Basis Nord.

Post Tower

Post Tower is the headquarters of the logistic company Deutsche Post DHL with the two brands postal services for Germany "Deutsche Post" and the worldwide logistic company DHL. The Post Tower is a 162.5-metre, 41-storey office building in Bonn, Germany. It was designed by German-American architect Helmut Jahn and won the 2002 Silver Emporis Skyscraper Award.
It is the ninth tallest skyscraper in Germany, and the tallest in Germany outside of Frankfurt am Main.
Building details.
The building is located at the river Rhine and in the center of the old parliament area of Bonn near the "Deutsche Welle" and has about 55,000 m² office surface. Construction phase was May 2000 to December 2002, 80,000 m³ of concrete and 16,000 tons of structural steel were used in the building shell. The building dimensions are; height: 162.5 m, width: 41.0 m, length: 81.1 m (with ring walls 86.55 m), weight: 300,000 t. The building has the ground floor, 40 upper floors and 5 underground levels. The Tower has a surface area of 7,000 m². The Tower is constructed as a steel-glass-building. The base of the Post Tower has the shape of two staggered semi-ellipses of two shifted circle segments. Most office walls, doors and the floors of skygardens and elevators are therefore made of 93,000 m² glass used.
Climate control concept.
A double skin glass façade with about 1.2 m cavity between external skin and the primary façade, provides natural ventilation regulated by venetian blinds. The north-facing windows at the front are smooth, the glass windows on the south-facing façade are gently sloping to allow a better flow of air (see picture). Via a decentralized underground convector the external air is sucked in from the space between the façades, conditioned and fed back into the offices. The air also reaches internal areas of the building through doors and corridors.
The office air is filtered into the Sky Gardens, warms up those areas and then is filtered back outside via façade flaps on the east and west sides of the Sky Gardens. The double skin façade enables huge energy savings.
The benefits gained by the Post Tower in using up to 130 liters of groundwater per second to heat and cool the concrete core. The remaining energy requirement is covered by connection to the district heating system, refrigerating equipment and heat pumps.

Belonio, who is an associate professor in agricultural engineering at the Central Philippine University of Iloilo City, received $50,000 and a chronometer from the Rolex company for being included in the five Associate Laureates of the Rolex Award. Belonio was 48 years old when he received the award, and said that he would use the money he received in promoting and disseminating his technology to other people without asking anything in return, by publishing information about the invention and establishing a Center for Rice Husk Technology in his hometown at Iloilo, Philippines. The actual formal recognition of Belonio by Rolex as the first Filipino Associate Laureate of the Rolex Award was held at The Manila Peninsula in the City of Makati on January 21, 2009.
Belonio's invention.
History.
Belonio started work relating to rice husks in 2003, at a time when there were high fuel prices. As an expert, he had already designed thirty devices such as paddy dryers and water pumps which can be used by low-income Filipino farmers. Belonio concentrated on innovating the rice husk oven even though the concept was not a new one, because there was already the so-called Lo Trao from Vietnam. The difference was that Belonio's invention does not produce smoke and has a stable fire without a tar-like residue. Belonio used good engineering and ample ventilation for his stove, which is characterized by a small fan that is powered either by electricity or batteries, producing a more efficient burn of the rice husks.
Belonio's first ovens cost $100 (or around ₱5,000) each, but due to further development and research, he was able to lower the price to $25 (or around ₱1,250) each. The only expected expense for the user of the oven would be 20 cents per day for running the built-in fan inside the stove. The invention is currently being produced by companies in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Cambodia, all cooperating with Belonio's works. According to Belonio his stove would be able to save a family of rice farmers $150 per year in fuel expenses. He also added that a ton of rice husk contains energy equal to 415 liters of petroleum (or 378 liters of kerosene). Belonio's stove lessens toxic fumes and smoke that affect the environment, and reduces greenhouse gases. The burnt remnants of the rice husks can later be used as soil fertilizers or in making small blocks of coal substitute.
Description.
Belonio's rice husk stove is a small cylinder equipped with a fan in its base, which provides air during the conversion of rice hulls into gas. It was designed as an apparatus that can be easily operated. Fish can be fried in fifteen minutes using the stove. The stove consumes 2 kilograms of rice husks per hour. It does not produce any smoke, and the burnt rice husks can still be used as coal and also as insulating cement for traditional stoves fueled by wood. Plans for the stove are available free of charge from the internet.

Australian securities law

Australian securities law relates to securities issued by corporations as well as other securities, including debentures, stocks and bonds issued by governments, and interests in managed investment schemes.
Australian securities regulation rests on the principle that "financial markets cannot function effectively unless participants act with integrity and there is adequate disclosure to facilitate informed judgements". As a result, many of the regulatory rules governing dealings in securities are part of a broader framework that governs financial products, financial services and financial markets.
Mandatory disclosure and conduct regulation underlie much of Australia's securities regulation. False trading, fraudulent dealing, and insider trading are dealt with to prevent improper practices in connection with securities markets. A licensing system operates to ensure securities markets are fair, orderly and transparent. At the same time, securities law is also facilitative, allocating rights and duties in conjunction with general contract law. It also allows for a degree of self-regulation, by the operation for example of an independent securities exchange.
Australian securities law has been substantially modernised in recent years. The core of these laws are found in the "Corporations Act" 2001 (Cth), which contains provisions governing takeovers, fundraising, and financial products, services and markets.
Legal and regulatory framework.
The main body of substantive law about securities is found in the "Corporations Act" 2001 (Cth), as well as the regulations made under that Act. Whilst much of the law is derived from earlier regulation (especially the bust in Australian mineral stocks of the late 1960s), the sections relating to securities regulation have been subject to recent amendment. The takeovers provisions were substantially re-written by the "Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act" 1999. Changes to financial products, financial markets, and financial services were introduced by the "Financial Services Reform Act" 2001 (Cth), as a result of the Wallis report.
Elements of securities law are also found in the general law governing contracts, trusts, and torts. Securities regulation under the "Corporations Act" operates against the background of other Commonwealth legislation on criminal law, administrative law, and statutory interpretation.
Administration of the legislation is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), according to the "Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act" 2001 (Cth) and the "Corporations Act" 2001 (Cth). The market operator Australia Stock Exchange also has an important regulatory role to play.
The resolution of disputes is confided to the Federal Court and the Supreme Courts of the States and the Northern Territory, with other courts having some powers to apply the securities legislation.
Definitions.
A security is "a thing in action", a claim enforceable by legal proceedings rather than owning some tangible property. To effect regulation the legislation adopts various definitions of "security" and "financial product" that are used.
There is also no law which stipulates that no person in which authority is not given (anyone other the law enforcement or owners of an establishment) may restrict persons entering and leaving a premises.
Licensing.
Only the holder of a market licence may operate a financial market.
Financial intermediaries.
A person who carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence.
Market misconduct.
Prevention of fraud and other forms of market misconduct has its foundation in the efficient-market hypothesis.
General common law prohibitions against interfering with the free public market are strengthened by statutory prohibitions against various forms of market misconduct.
One set of statutory prohibitions is upon trading activity which manipulates market prices. There are further prohibitions upon conduct that involves false trading or market rigging.

Britton Plaza Shopping Center

Britton Plaza Shopping Center is a open-air shopping plaza in the Fair Oaks - Manhattan Manor neighborhood of Tampa, Florida (on the corner of Dale Mabry Highway and Euclid Avenue). The plaza was built in 1956 and includes anchors: Publix Super Market, Bealls Outlet, Tuesday Morning, Stein Mart, Burlington Coat Factory, Marshall's, Michaels, and Big Lots, as well as a GNC, Taco Bell, and a variety of local stores including The Perfect Gift that opened in 2011. The plaza also has an eight-screen theater, operated by Five Star Cinemas, which reopened in August 2009.[http://southtampa2.tbo.com/content/2009/aug/12/121514/britton-theater-reopens-friday-recent-releases-ind/news/. The theater was previously operated by Regal Entertainment in the mid-1990s and later Zota Theatres during the early and mid-2000s. Additionally, Fashion Bug closed its Britton Plaza location in March 2009. And China Garden Super Buffet closed its doors in June to prepare for an expansion. It reopened as the Tampa Buffet on November 29, 2009 and includes expanded dining facilities and buffet selection. In February 2011, Walgreens relocated to a new, standalone location across the street from the plaza (Pet Supermarket will occupy the former space during the 1st quarter of 2012), and in April 2011, Plato's Closet opened in the old Fashion Bug location (the other half of the former Fashion Bug storefront has been occupied by Five Dollar Fashions since 2009).
History.
When the shopping center opened in 1956, Publix was among the original tenants, along with several other stores, including, J.C. Penney, National Shirt Shops, W.T. Grant, Neisners, Thom McAn, Jarman Shoes, Baker Shoes, Western Auto, and Rexall Drugs to name a few. The entire plaza was decorated in 1950s art-deco styling and included a nicely decorated courtyard. An elaborate sign, reminiscent of the old Florida style was erected alongside Dale Mabry Highway and still stands today. The movie theater, originally operated By General Cinema, consisted of one screen and later was expanded to two screens. The building currently housing Burlington Coat Factory was opened in the mid-1960s as a Belk Lindsay store which replaced one in Ybor City. In later years it was converted to a J Byron store, followed by an Uptons store in the mid-1990s.
In 1987, Publix closed its Britton Plaza location, with Idaho-based Albertsons moving into the space at the plaza a couple years later. Albertsons helped reshape Britton Plaza to what it is today by undertaking a renovation and expansion of the old Publix space. Ironically, Publix has now taken over the Albertson's store at Britton Plaza. The entire plaza was renovated to today's appearance during the course of the late 1980s. The movie theater expanded to eight screens and underwent a renovation of its own in 1992.
In 2001, Regal Entertainment, which operated the theater for several years during the 1990s, pulled out of Britton Plaza, further signaling the decline of smaller cinemas and the growth of larger cineplexes. Not long after, Frank's Nursery and Gardens closed down and its building was demolished, making way for a plaza extension in 2003 that brought Michaels and Marshall's to the plaza, as well as the return of Big Lots, which previously sat in the space now occupied by Tuesday Morning. In 2006, Zota Theaters took over the cinema space, hoping for a turnaround in the plaza's movie going business.
2008 signaled a shake-up of sorts for Britton Plaza. The deteriorating economic climate had forced several businesses to close down, including a few local stores. In June of that year, Publix announced that it was purchasing 49 Albertsons stores in Florida, including the Britton Plaza location. When the deal closed in September, Albertsons vacated the plaza and renovation work began a month later. Just days before Albertsons' departure from the plaza, Zota Theaters announced it was pulling out as well. The company was unable to gain steady patrons and compete with bigger movie houses such as the AMC WestShore 14 at nearby WestShore Plaza.
With the "reopening" of Publix on January 8, 2009, and re-opening of the 8-screen movie theater, it seems that Britton Plaza has turned the corner despite the ongoing recession. Additionally, several new businesses had opened in the plaza since 2009; including Arbys, Five Dollar Fashions, Plato's Closet, The Perfect Gift, and the Missing Piece.
HART Transfer Center.
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) operates a transfer center at Britton Plaza. Routes 4, 19, 36, and 89, as well as Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority's Route 100X, transfer at a shelter structure in the center of the plaza's parking lots.

<doc id="21360089" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21360089" title="Environmental tariff">
Environmental tariff

An Environmental tariff, also known as a green tariff or eco-tariff, is an import or export tax placed on products being imported from, or also being sent to countries with substandard environmental pollution controls. They can be used as controls on global pollution and can also be considered as corrective measures against "environmental races to the bottom" and "eco-dumping".
International trade vs. environmental degradation.
There has been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution. While some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local environmental degradation and a global "tragedy of the commons" are intimately linked to increases in international trade, others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they'll also advocate for cleaner environments. According to a World Bank paper:
Early tariff implementation proposal.
Although the United States has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures, it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations. The proposed legislation was tabled as the International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 and was introduced in its Senate in April of that year.
Proposed International Pollution Control Index.
A notable feature of the proposed U.S. "International Pollution Deterrence Act" was the international pollution control index it cited within its Section 5, which read:
INTERNATIONAL POLLUTION CONTROL INDEX<br>
Section 8002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6982) is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof:<br>
`(t) The Administrator shall prepare, within one hundred and twenty days of the enactment of this section and yearly thereafter, a pollution control index for each of the top fifty countries identified by the Office of Trade and Investment of the Department of Commerce based on the value of exports to the United States from that country's attainment of pollution control standards in the areas of air, water, hazardous waste and solid waste as compared to the United States. The purpose of this index is to measure the level of compliance within each country with standards comparable to or greater than those in the United States. The Administrator shall analyze, in particular, the level of technology employed and actual costs incurred for pollution control in the major export sectors of each country in formulating the index.
Agitation against use of environmental tariffs.
Environment tariffs were not implemented in the past, in part, because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the World Trade Organization and within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform.
Additionally, many foreign factory owners in newly industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious...

Organography

Organography (from Greek , "organo", "organ"; and , "-graphy") is the scientific description of the structure and function of the organs of living things.
History.
Organography as a scientific study starts with Aristotle, who considered the parts of plants as "organs" and began to consider the relationship between different organs and different functions. In the 17th century Joachim Jung, clearly articulated that plants are composed of different organ types such as root, stem and leaf, and he went on to define these organ types on the basis of form and position.
In the following century Caspar Friedrich Wolff was able to follow the development of organs from the "growing points" or apical meristems. He noted the commonality of development between foliage leaves and floral leaves (e.g. petals) and wrote: "In the whole plant, whose parts we wonder at as being, at the first glance, so extraordinarily diverse, I finally perceive and recognize nothing beyond leaves and stem (for the root may be regarded as a stem). Consequently all parts of the plant, except the stem, are modified leaves."
Similar views were propounded at by Goethe in his well known treatise. He wrote: "The underlying relationship between the various external parts of the plant, such as the leaves, the calyx, the corolla, the stamens, which develop one after the other and, as it were, out of one another, has long been generally recognized by investigators, and has in fact been specially studied; and the operation by which one and the same organ presents itself to us in various forms has been termed Metamorphosis of Plants."

Scar (album)

Scar is the eighth studio album by Joe Henry, released in May 2001 on Mammoth Records. Co-produced by Craig Street, it marked another shift in direction for Henry's music, and a foray into the genres of jazz and soul music. The opening track is a homage to comedian Richard Pryor (whom the album is also dedicated to), and according to Henry's essay "The Ghost in the Song," he was "called by a vision" to collaborate with free jazz artist Ornette Coleman. Henry wrote:
Henry eventually convinced Coleman to record a solo for the track "Richard Pryor Addresses a Tearful Nation," and also contributed a reprise at the very end of the album as a hidden track.
Another track of note is "Stop", a tango originally written by Henry. His wife, Melanie, sent an early demo of the track to her sister Madonna, who re-used the lyrics for Don't Tell Me. Henry often quips during live gigs that "I recorded my version as a tango, and she recorded hers as a hit". Apart from the lyrics, the two songs have nothing in common.
Lizz Wright recorded a jazzy take on "Stop" which she included in her 2005 release "Dreaming Wide Awake", also an album produced by Craig Street and recorded by S. Husky Höskulds.

Aajuitsup Tasia

Aajuitsup Tasia (old spelling: "Aujuitsup Tasia") is a large lake in central-western Greenland, in the Qeqqata municipality. It is located approximately northeast of Kangerlussuaq. It is of elongated oval shape, with its western shore at and its eastern shore at . Aajuitsup Tasia is an oligotrophic lake of depth, covering an area of 1,350ha.
Geography.
The 2x10 km lake is separated from the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua valley and Kangerlussuaq in the south by a low tundra ridge − part of the Kangaamiut dike swarm. To the west lies a sibling Sanningasoq twin lake. To the north-east lies the wide highland of Isunngua.
The surface of Aajuitsup Tasia is almost level with the surface of the neighboring meltwater lake, an outflow of Russell Glacier. The altitude differential produces an outflowing boggy stream flowing from Aajuitsup Tasia to the unnamed meltwater lake, allowing Aajuitsup Tasia to retain its freshwater character despite being directly in the glacier outflow path.

Drosera subg. Ergaleium

"Drosera" subg. "Ergaleium", collectively known as the tuberous sundews, is a subgenus of three sections of tuberous species in the genus "Drosera". The three sections represent natural groups, including the rosetted species (section "Erythrorhiza"), the fan-leaved species (section "Stolonifera"), and the erect or scrambling species (section "Ergaleium").
The subgenus was first formally described by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, but the exact taxonomy has been changed frequently since then. In 1848, Jules Émile Planchon reorganized the species into sections, series, and subseries. George Bentham disagreed with Planchon's classification and so in 1864 he divided the genus into just two sections, with all tuberous species in sect. "Ergaleium" and those without tubers in sect. "Rorella". Ludwig Diels reclassified the genus in his 1906 monograph of the family, recognizing subgenus "Ergaleium" and two sections within it: "Erythrorhiza" (Planchon) Diels and "Polypeltes" Diels. Another reclassification occurred in 1977, when Larry Eugene DeBuhr added section "Stolonifera", which was based on Planchon's subseries "Stoloniferae". Section "Polypeltes" is now known by the older autonym sect. "Ergaleium".

Decapping complex

The mRNA decapping complex is a protein complex in eukaryotic cells responsible for removal of the 5' cap. The core of the decapping complex is the Nudix family enzyme Dcp2. Many other proteins assemble with Dcp2 to form a protein complex. 
Yeast decapping complex.
In yeast ("S. cerevisiae"), Dcp2 is joined by the decapping activator Dcp1, the helicase Dhh1, the exonuclease Xrn1, nonsense mediated decay factors Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3, the LSm complex, Pat1, and various other proteins. These proteins all localize to cytoplasmic structures called P-bodies. Notably in yeast there are no translation factors or ribosomal proteins inside P-bodies.
Metazoan decapping complex.
Higher eukaryotes have slightly different members of the decapping complex. The enzyme Dcp2 is still the catalytic subunit along with Dcp1, Xrn1, Upf1-3, the LSm complex, and the Dhh1 ortholog Rck/p-54. Proteins unique to plants and mammals include the beta propeller protein Hedls and the enhancer of decapping Edc3. Structural details of the assembly of this complex are not known, only physical association by immunoprecipitation.

<doc id="21360369" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21360369" title="Gungnyeo">
Gungnyeo

Gungnyeo (literally "palace women") is a Korean term referring to women waiting on the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. It is short for "gungjung yeogwan", which translates as "a lady officer of the royal court". "Gungnyeo" includes "sanggung" (palace matron) and "nain" (assistant court ladies), both of which hold rank as officers. The term is also used more broadly to encompass women in a lower class without a rank such as "musuri" (lowest maids in charge of odd chores), "gaksimi", "sonnim", "uinyeo" (female physicians) as well as "nain" and "sanggung".
Establishment.
Although the first record of "gungnyeo" appears in "Goryeosa", a compilation on the history of Goryeo, a provision was first made in 1392 by King Taejo per Jo Jun (趙浚) and other officers' suggestions after the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1428 Sejong the Great set up a detailed system regulating "gungnyeo", in which female officers were divided into "naegwan" (internal offices, concerned with the royal court) and "gunggwan" (palace officers), and defined their ranks, titles, and social status. He further institutionalized the system, with revisions, in the Gyeongguk daejeon (Complete Code of Laws).
The "gungnyeo" were not clearly defined during the Goryeo period, and it is not known how they came to serve the court and what procedures applied to them. The use of the term during that period is therefore assumed to refer to all women in the king's service in the court. In documents related to Goryeo, the social status of "gungnyeo" was generally commoner or lower class, such as the daughters of slaves, concubines, or cheonmin (the despised). In the 22nd year of King Uijong "gungnyeo" roles were divided into "sanggung" (尙宮, managing the palace), "sangchim" (尙寢, managing bedding), "sangsik" (尙食 managing food), and another type of "sangchim" (尙針, managing sewing). Female musicians called "yeoak" were also a part of the "gungnyeo". 
During the Joseon Dynasty, court life was centered on the King, so many court women were necessary. They were assigned to the "Daejeon" (大殿; the Great Hall), "Naejeon" (內殿, private inner royal hall), the "Daebijeon" (the Queen dowager's quarter), or the "Sejajeon" (the crown prince's quarter) of the palace.
Election and education.
The appointment of "gungnyeo" usually occurred one year in ten, but there were exceptions; the method of appointing "gungnyeo" and their social status differed from time to time, so the process was not systematized. In general, gungnyeo were chosen from among female slaves who belonged to the governing class rather than from daughters of the "sangmin" (common people in rank). However, if circumstances allowed, people around the king wanted to pick "gungnyeo" from commoners' children, using a custom of early marriage in households that had a daughter over ten years old. As a result, since King Gyeongjong's reign, daughters from the lower class were prohibited to be appointed as "gungnyeo". According to the "Sokdaejeon" (Supplement to the National Code), some female slaves of each government office were chosen to become "gungnyeo" since the reign of King Yeongjo. 
While this restriction on class applied to "common gungnyeo", the appointment of those in important roles, closely waiting on the king and queen, such as "jimil nain", was different. The standard for choosing "jimil nain" was so high that "sanggung" tended to go out recruiting candidates through personal connections and by family custom. There were many "gungnyeo" in service who recommended their relatives for the position. The social status of the "gungnyeo" who were assigned to "jimil", "chimbang" (the sewing department), and "subang" (the embroidery department) came from the "jungin" class (literally "middle class"); the others mostly came from "commoner's class". Common "gungnyeo" entered the palace at the age of twelve to thirteen, whereas "jimil nain" entered there at the age of four to eight, and "nain" for the sewing and embroidery departments began to serve the court at six to thirteen.
Such "trainee "gungnyeo"" received the necessary education to become "gungnyeo", such as learning court language, required daily conducts and behaviors, and writing "gungche" (palace-style font). Some "gungnyeo" left refined calligraphy works written in hangul (the Korean alphabet) with the "gungche" or "Gyechuk ilgi" (Diary of the Year Gyechuk, 1613) and "Inhyeon wanghujeon" (Tales of Queen Inhyeon), all of which are regarded as excellent examples of the "palace literature".
The types of gungnyeo.
In the narrow meaning.
"Gungnyeo" always distinguished themselves from the "sanggung" and "nain" because the role and social status of the groups were greatly different. The latter groups can be divided into three types; trainee "nain", "nain", and "sanggung". They were treated differently according experience and length of service at court and in affiliated departments. Even the "sanggung" group was divided by rank according to their experience, and sanggung with the same rank did not always have the same social standing. Trainee nain referred to young girls who had not yet passed the gwallye (冠禮, a coming-of-age ceremony) and they were divided into "saenggaksi" and "gaksi". The term, "saenggaksi" derives from that fact that the girls had a hairstyle called "saengmeori". Only three departments, "jimil", "chimbang", and "subang" had the "saenggaksi". After fifteen years service in the palace the trainee "nain" became an official "nain". "Nain" wore a jade-colored "dangui" (a variety of "jeogori", a short jacket) and a navy blue "chima" (a bulky skirt) and decorated their head with a frog-shaped "cheopji" (a hairpin).
In the broad meaning.
"Gaksimi" is a generic term collectively referring to a housemaid, kitchen-maid, seamstress or others working at a sanggung's private residence on sanggung's days off. Their monthly salary was paid by the state, so they were also called "bangja". The term "bangja" means a clerk working at a government office and is the same as the male character called "bangja" who appears in "Chunhyangjeon" (Story of Chunhyang). "Musuri" refers to women in charge of miscellaneous jobs (such as drawing water, making a fire, etc.) at every residence at court.
"Sonnim" is a type of housemaid who took charge of housekeeping at the king's concubine's residence. They were generally related to the concubine's family, and their salary was paid from the concubine's living expenses. The term means a person from outside of the palace and is a courtesy title, unlike "musuri" and "gaksimi". 
"Uinyeo" literally means "medicine women" and they usually treated "gungnyeo" with acupuncture and acted as midwife when the king's consort or concubine gave birth. Whenever a feast was held at court they transformed themselves into "gisaeng" (female entertainers). For such occasions, they wore "wonsam" (a female ceremonial garment), "hwagwan" (an elaborate coronet) on their head and colorfully striped "hansam" (fabric extensions on the sleeves of the costume) on their hands just like dancers, so they were also called "yakbang gisaeng" and consequently "yakbang" is another name for "naeuiwon" (royal health clinic). Although "uinyeo"'s affiliation was to the "naeuiwon", their predecessors were gisaeng. The "uinyeo" system was originally established during King Taejong's reign because sick consorts, concubines and gungnyeo preferred to die rather than to be seen by a male doctor, due to the strict "naeoebeop" (sex segregation), based on Confucianism, at that time. Young slave girls who belonged to storage or government offices were therefore chosen to train in medical practices such as pulse-checking, acupuncture and others. Because they were originally uneducated "cheonmin" (the despised), the uinyeo system was not very fruitful. During King Yeonsangun's reign, whenever a feast was held at each government office, "uinyeo" were told to participate in it as "gisaeng" with makeup. The system lasted until the end of the dynasty and the number of "uinyeo" was about eighty during King Gojong's reign. The "uinyeo" system disappeared when western doctors entered the court.
Gungnyeo's roles.
"Gungnyeo" can be described as a type of luxurious slaves for royal private life, needed in departments in charge of clothing, cooking and housing among others. Such places were "jimil" ("the innermost quarter", waiting closely on royalty), "chimbang" (the sewing department), "subang" (the embroidery department), two "sojubang"; "naesojobang" and "oesojubang", one for preparing daily meals, another for preparing food for banquets, "saenggwabang" (the dessert department), and "sedapbang" (the laundry department).
In addition to those seven departments, four other departments existed: "sesugan" (洗手間, the department in charge of the king and queen's washing and bathing), "toeseongan" (退膳間; a food arrangement room), "bogicheo" (僕伊處, the department for making fires), "deungchokbang" (燈燭房 the department for lanterns and candlelight).
In terms of a more common individual's household "jimil nain", who had the highest standing in "gungnyeo" society, acted like a personal maid to the mistress. "Nain" (assistant court ladies) at "chimbang", and "subang" were like seamstresses while "nain" at "sojubang" and "saenggwabang" were like kitchen-maids. "Sedapbang" managed the laundry; in common families, female slaves generally did the cleaning, while experienced housewives ironed and smoothed laundry by pounding. "Jimil nain" had the highest social status while nain at "chimbang", and "subang" were next in status. They could wear a "chima" (a bulky skirt) in the way which "yangban" women did, and were allowed as a privilege to let it down long without wearing an apron. Since they worked on a floor or in a room, these nain did not need to fold up their skirt, unlike nain at "sojubang", and "sedapbang". Nain at the other departments rolled up their skirt with an apron. Likewise, only the former three departments could have "saenggaksi" (생각시, young "nain" with a hairstyle called "saeng" or "sayang"), while young nain at the others could not bind their hair with "saeng" but had to let it down in long braids.
Gungnyeo's rank.
Gungnyeo society had supervisors who acted as the head of the "gungnyeo" group, and "sanggung" who received special treatment according to the importance of their job. "Jejo sanggung" (提調尙宮), also called "Keunbang sanggung" were senior among gungnyeo and received the king's orders and managed properties in the queen's quarter. They exercised political power at the time. "Bujejo sanggung" also called "Arigo sanggung" (阿里庫) took charge of items in stores attached to the queen's quarter. "Jimil sanggung" also called " Daeryeong sanggung" waited closely on the king. "Bomo sanggung" took charge of nursing princes or princesses, and among them those who served the crown prince had the highest standing among the group. "Sinyeo sanggung" were in charge of assisting the king, queen and queen dowager whenever a national ceremony or feast occurred. They also managed books and documents of the "Jimil sanggung" and did "gokeup" (mourning and crying loudly). "Gamchal sanggung" gave rewards or punishments to relevant gungnyeo, acting as a supervisors, and were held in awe by other gungnyeo. Some "gungnyeo" who were favoured by the king could take political power and improve their rank.
Palace ladies were subordinated to the queen, and were ranked below the Royal Noble Consorts ("ne-gwan" 내관). The ranks for gungnyeo would could reach the 5th rank at the highest, but typically started much lower in the 9th rank.
There were 5 ranks for palace ladies with two level each.
The palace ladies were followed by lower rank ladies-in-waiting (e.g. palace lady candidates), servants and slaves.
The number of gungnyeo.
The total number of "gungnyeo" included not only "gungnyeo" at the main palace where the king resided but also at "Jesagung", palaces for "jesa", (ancestor veneration) and "Byeolgung", (annexed palaces). "Gungnyeo" who worked within the main palace despised those who worked in annexed palaces, calling them "gunggeot" (the one at the palace). In the main palace, the king's quarter was managed as an independent household, and all of the king, queen, queen dowager's quarters had the same number of "gungnyeo". It has been suggested that "gungnyeo" numbered 90 in total. Each of these residences would have twenty to twenty seven "jimil nain" and the other places would have fifteen to twenty.
The total number differed from time and was increased or decreased depending on circumstances at court. While the number of "gungnyeo" in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty was not great, it tended to increase as time went by. During King Seongjong's reign (1469–1494), 105 "gungnyeo" in total served the palace, with 29 for the mother of the previous king, 27 for the queen dowager's quarter and 49 for the king's quarter. During the reign of King Gojong (1863–1907), the total number of "gungnyeo" reached 480; 100 for the king's quarter, 100 for the queen dowager's quarter, 100 for the queen, 60 for the crown prince, 40 for the consort of the heir apparent, 50 for the "seson", the son of the prince successor, and 30 for the wife of the "seson".
Lifetime employment and payment.
All "gungnyeo" within the palace were basically tied for life, from their acceptance into the palace until the time at which they had to leave. Once they entered service they had to live inside the palace for their whole life, except for special occasions. Apart from the king and his immediate household, nobody, not even his concubines, could die in the royal court, so when "gungnyeo" became old or ill, they had to leave the palace. There were other reasons to release "gungnyeo" from the palace, such as when their superior or master was ill, or when a drought happened, a certain number of "gungnyeo" were released in appeasement of the natural calamity. In the latter case, such released "gungnyeo" were restricted in their actions, prohibited from marrying, and would be harshly punished if they violated these rules. Thus "gungnyeo" lived completely isolated from outside life, and were not allowed to contact men, or even other women, except by release from service. The life of "gungnyeo" is depicted in an ancient novel titled "Unyeongjeon" (雲英傳) written by an anonymous writer during the Joseon Dynasty.
"Gungnyeo" received a graded monthly salary according to rank and living necessities as their payment, but the price was not fixed. It varied according to economic circumstances at that time. Service was assumed to be on a day-shift basis.

Carleton Beals

Carleton Beals (November 13, 1893 – April 4, 1979) was an American journalist, author, historian, and a crusader with special interests in Latin America.
Early years.
Beals was born in Medicine Lodge, Kansas. His father, Leon Eli Beals (1864–1941), lawyer and journalist, was the stepson of Carrie Nation, the temperance movement advocate. His mother was Elvina Sybilla Blickensderfer (1867–?). His brother, Ralph Leon Beals (1901–85), was the first anthropologist at University of California, Los Angeles.
The family moved from Kansas when Beals was age three, and he attended school in Pasadena, California. After graduating from high school in 1911, he worked a variety of jobs while attending the University of California, Berkeley where he studied engineering and mining. He won the Bonnheim Essay Prize and the Bryce History Essay Prize. After graduating cum laude, he attended Columbia University on a graduate scholarship, earning a Masters degree in 1917.
Career.
Unable to find work as a writer, Beals took a job with Standard Oil Company, but it did not suit him. In 1918, he spent a brief period of time in jail as a World War I draft evader. Upon release, he decided to go see the world, and with what little money he had, Beals and his wife Lillian drove to Mexico. There, he founded the English Preparatory Institute, and taught at the American High School. They left Mexico in 1921 for Europe where Beals studied at the University of Madrid, and then the University of Rome. Back in Mexico, he became a correspondent for "The Nation", separated from his wife, and became romantically involved with photographer Tina Modotti's sister, Mercedes.
In February 1928, Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of "The Nation", sent Beals to Nicaragua to write a series of articles. He became notable as the only foreign journalist who interviewed General Augusto Sandino during Nicaragua's 1927–33 war against US military occupation.
In all, Beals wrote over 200 magazine articles for publications such as the "New Republic" and "Harper's Magazine". Beals also wrote more than 45 books, including on history, geography, and travel. Some of his books are written for a juvenile audience. His autobiography, "Glass Houses", was published by J.B. Lippincott Company in 1938. In 1931, Beals was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for biographies. His biography subjects included Porfirio Díaz, Huey P. Long, Roberto de la Selva, Stephen F. Austin, John Eliot, Carrie Nation, and Leon Trotsky.
During his career, Beals witnessed Mexican revolutions, lectured on Shakespeare, and was held incommunicado by a Mexican general. His travels took him to French Morocco, Tunisia, Algiers, Greece, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the Caribbean. He was a Ford Hall Forum speaker in 1936, and a member of the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky in 1937. The following year, "Time Magazine" called Beals, "the best informed and the most awkward living writer on Latin America."
Later years.
During the 1960s, he supported the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Beals was a hero to the young people of Cuba.
In his later year, Beals lived on Fire Tower Road in Killingworth, Connecticut. He is buried in Killingworth's Evergreen Cemetery.

Nudix family

The Nudix family is a protein family of phosphohydrolases. Using water-mediated catalysis they break a phosphate bond in their substrate to create two products. Nudix stands for Nucleoside Diphosphate linked to X. There are two components to the Nudix family: the so-called Nudix fold of a beta sheet with alpha helices on each side and the Nudix motif which contains catalytic and metal-binding amino acids. The Nudix motif is GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU where U is Isoleucine, Leucine, or Valine and X is any amino acid. This forms a short helix which (usually) contains the catalytic amino acids. Nudix family enzymes include Dcp2 of the decapping complex, ADP-ribose diphosphatase, MutT, ADPRase, Ap4A, RppH, and many others.

Calgary Police Service Pipe Band

Since its first public performance leading the 1975 Calgary Stampede Parade, the Calgary Police Service Pipe Band has represented the City of Calgary and the Calgary Police Service by performing across Canada, the United States, and Europe.
Today, the Band has more than 50 pipers, drummers, and dancers and continues to perform annually at a wide variety of events including Calgary Police Service functions, municipal and provincial events, parades, and highland games. The Band performs with the permission of its Colonel-in-Chief, Rick Hanson.
History and traditions.
The band was modeled after other successful police service pipe bands, notably that of the Edinburgh Police. 
The band performed at the 1989 Nova Scotia International Tattoo. 
Pipe Major Bill Crabbe composed a tune specifically for the band to use as its own signature tune, entitled "The Calgary City Police Pipe Band". The band refers to it as a "regimental march", betraying the British military influence on the band. This heritage is further reflected in the full Scottish ceremonial dress adopted, as well as the lesser orders of dress.
In full dress, all musicians wear the feather bonnet headdress, with wool doublet, plaid and kilt in Prince Charles Edward Stuart tartan. A modified CPS service dress jacket "cut-away" in Highland style to accommodate the sporran is worn for lesser occasions, and shirt-sleeve order is worn in summer or on occasions permitting it. A glengarry with distinctive black-and-white dice design is worn with the CPS cap badge in all orders of dress not calling for the feather bonnet.
Regular events.
The band performs annually in the Calgary Stampede Parade, having attended every one since the inception of the organization.
The band regularly competes at local Highland games such as the Canmore Highland Games every Labour Day weekend.
The band is also used for CPS ceremonial events, including award ceremonies and graduation parades.
Two annual dinners are held, one for Robert Burns night, a tradition since 1976, and another "Mess Dinner" in military style to honour members of the Pipe Band.
Style.
Unlike military pipes and drums, the group is officially styled Calgary Police Service Pipe Band.

Manifesto of three-day corvee

The Manifesto of three-day corvee or An Imperial Edict Forbidding Sunday Labor by Serfs () was issued by the Russian emperor Paul I on April 16, 1797 as a first ever legal attempt at extending the rights of Russian serfs. The document prohibited use of corvee labour on Sundays by landowners, the State and the Court, prescribing that the rest of the week should be divided in half between the landowners' requests and peasants' own needs, theoretically restricting landowners' command over labour use to just three days in a week.

While primarily targeted towards Mexico, regional variations for ESPN Dos are also broadcast for Venezuela and Central America/Dominican Republic due to differing programming rights between the regions. Prior to 2008, ESPN Dos was shown in Colombia and Peru, but those countries switched to the more soccer-oriented ESPN+. Currently, Venezuela is the only country in South America where ESPN Dos is still available, due to baseball being more popular than soccer.

Dimitris Nikolaidis

Dimitris Nikolaidis (; 1922 – 21 January 1993) was a Greek actor.
Career.
He was born in 1922 in Asia Minor and died on January 1993. His journey of life began on a ship that headed from Constantinople (now Istanbul) to Piraeus, between them two youngsters, Eftalia and Nikos. His family moved to Greece to escape the Turkish raids. During his transfer trip, his father got sick.
The family settled in Athens as the father's sickness did not retreat (the problem was mainly genetic as from the father's organism that shook an enzyme, it cleand the blood without knowing that revived the body). He died soon after at Sotiria hospital from galloping pneumonia. Nine days earlier Dimitris was born.
From his young age he loved sports even track and field. He was a good student which he was one of the 30 children that passed with scholarship from the Experimental School in Kolonaki which it was the greatest school in Athens on Skoufa(s) St(r).
During the enemy occupation he had work and power in resistance. In 1942 Khun ( or Coon) ran the Art Theatre with a company that used students that included himself. It had a debut in 1944 with his student Alekos Solomos "O Teleftaios Asprokorakas"
He participated in Mrs Katerina's company in 1945 in which he stayed until 1949 ; he later went on with Vasilis Logothetidis with a play by Alekos Sakellarios. For four years, he played with other companies and in 1954 returned again to act with Logothetidis for three years in films not only with as Logothetidis' character.
He met his wife Souli Sabah, a friend of Ilia Livykou, in Athens after the trip that Souli made in Egypt which she stayed (a year before she welcomed to the company) and a month later, recognized on September 15, 1955.
In film, he made his first movie "The Girl From the Neighbourhood" in 1954 with Smaroula Giouli, Giorgos Fountas, Orestis Makris, etc. He also played in international roles including "America, America" by Elia Kazan. He played in 80 movies.
In the summer of 1965, he played and directed his first theatrical play at the "Minoa" Theatre "Mia Pentaras Niata" ("Μια Πεντάρας Νιάτα") by Pretenteris-Gialamas which was successful. That was his beginning. Without directing, he appeared several times as an actor in theatrical play "Oute gata oute zimia" ("No Cats, Not Even a Damage") by Alekos Sakellarios-Giannakopoulos "Agapi mou Paliogria" ("Αγάπη Μου Παλιόγρια") with Paul Vassiliadis - Lakis Michailidis, etc.
His last role on stage was in 1980 in "I erotiarides" by Vasos Andrianos.
He worked with several stars including Elli Lambeti, Tzeni Karezi, Lambros Konstantaras, Costas Voutsas, etc.
On the small screen, from his great success are "Ekeines kai Ego" with Lambros Konstantaras. He still liked his friend and fellow actor and theatrical writer Kostas Pretenteris. Together appeared in "O Thyroros" which he played a Bulldozer.
In films, he directed only one movie, a comedy, called "I gynaika mou trellathike" with Mairi Aroni and Lambros Konstantaras.
His wife was Souli Sabah (or Sambach) (born 1931 in Cairo), an actress and director. They directed on YENED with a serial "Ekeines ki ego" with Lambros Konstantaras.

Chinese zodiac

The Shēngxiào, literally "birth likeness", is also known in English as the Chinese zodiac. "Zodiac" derives from the similar concept in western astrology and means "circle of animals". The Chinese zodiac is a scheme and systematic plan of future action that relates each year to an animal and its reputed attributes according to a 12-year cycle, and it remains popular in several East Asian countries including China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan.
Name.
Identifying this scheme using the term "zodiac" reflects several similarities to the western zodiac: both have time cycles divided into 12 parts, each labels at least the majority of those parts with names of animals, and each is widely associated with a culture of ascribing a person's personality or events in his or her life to the supposed influence of the person's particular relationship to the cycle. Nevertheless, there are major differences: the Chinese 12-part cycle corresponds to years, rather than months. The Chinese zodiac is represented by 12 animals, whereas some of the signs in the Western zodiac are not animals, despite the implication of the Greek etymology of "zodiac". The animals of the Chinese zodiac are not associated with constellations, let alone those spanned by the ecliptic plane.
Signs.
The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat. The following are the twelve zodiac signs (each with its associated Earthly Branch) in order and their characteristics.
In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself. It is a common misconception that the animals assigned by year are the only signs and many western descriptions of Chinese astrology draw solely on this system. In fact, there are also animal signs assigned by month (called inner animals), by day (called true animals) and hours (called secret animals).
While a person might appear to be a Dragon because they were born in the year of the Dragon, they might also be a Snake internally, an Ox truly, and a Goat secretively.
Depending on the source, the Goat is sometimes interchangeable with a Sheep or Ram.
Chinese calendar.
Years.
Within the Four Pillars, the year is the pillar representing information about the person's family background and society or relationship with their grandparents. The person's age can also be easily deduced from the sign of the person, the current sign of the year and the person's perceived age (teens,mid 20's, 40's and so on). For example, a person who is a Tiger is either 12, 24, 36 or 48 years old in 2010, the year of the Tiger. In 2011, the year of the Rabbit, that person is one year older.
The following table shows the 60-year cycle matched up to the Western calendar for the years 1924–2043 (see Sexagenary cycle article for years 1804–2043). The sexagenary cycle begins at lichun 'about February 4' according to some astrological sources.
Months and solar terms.
Within the Four Pillars, the month is the pillar representing information about the person's parents or childhood. Many Chinese astrologers consider the month pillar to be the most important one in determining the circumstances of one's adult life.
The 12 animals are also linked to traditional Chinese agricultural calendar, which runs alongside the better known lunar calendar. Instead of months, this calendar is divided into 24 two week segments known as "Solar Terms". Each animal is linked to two of these solar terms for a period similar to the Western month. Unlike the 60 year lunar calendar, which can vary by as much as a month in relation to the Western calendar, the agricultural calendar varies by only one day, beginning on the Western February 3 or 4 every year. Again unlike the cycle of the lunar years, which begins with the Rat, the agricultural calendar begins with the Tiger as it is the first animal of spring.
As each sign is linked to a month of the solar year, it is thereby also linked to a season. Each of the elements is also linked to a season (see above), and the element that shares a season with a sign is known as that sign's "fixed element". In other words, that element is believed to impart some of its characteristics to the sign concerned. The fixed element of each sign applies also to the year and hour signs, and not just the monthly sign. It is important to note that the fixed element is separate from the cycle of elements which interact with the signs in the 60 year cycle.
Days.
A different animal rules each day. Within the Four Pillars, the day is the pillar representing information about the person him/herself—his/her adult and married life.
Monday: Goat
Tuesday: Dragon
Wednesday: Horse
Thursday: Rat, Pig
Friday: Rabbit, Snake, Dog
Saturday: Ox, Tiger, Rooster
Sunday: Monkey
Hours.
The Chinese zodiac is also used to label times of the day, with each sign corresponding to a "large-hour" or "shichen" (時辰), which is a two-hour period (24 divided by 12 animals). Determining this period depends on knowing an individual's exact time of birth. The secret animal is thought to be a person's truest representation, since this animal is determined by the smallest denominator: a person's birth hour. As this sign is based on the position of the sun in the sky and not the time shown on a local clock, followers of this system believe it to be important to compensate for daylight saving time. However, some on-line systems already compensate for daylight saving time, and astrologers may compensate for this as well, even though a client may already have compensated for it, leading to a theoretically inaccurate reading.
Within the Four Pillars, the hour is the pillar representing information about one's children and contributions to the world or later life.
The times above are based on Beijing CST, not on local solar time. As China has only a single time zone, a particular locality's solar time can differ by as much as four hours from Beijing time. Since China does not observe daylight savings time, conversions to and from other time systems is slightly complex. For example, 9 p.m. PST or 10 p.m. PDT corresponds to 12 noon Beijing CST, and 9 p.m. CET or 10 p.m. CEST corresponds to 4 a.m. of the next day, Beijing CST.
Compatibility.
As the Chinese zodiac is derived according to the ancient Five Elements Theory, every Chinese Sign is composed of five elements with relations, among those elements, of interpolation, interaction, over-action, and counter-action — believed to be the common law of motions and changes of creatures in the universe. Different people born under each animal sign supposedly have different personalities, and practitioners of Chinese astrology consult such traditional details and compatibilities to offer putative guidance in life or for love and marriage.

Four Pillars.
The Four Pillars method can be traced back to the Han Dynasty ( AD 220), and is still much used in Feng Shui astrology and general analysis today. The Four Pillars or Columns chart is called such as the Chinese writing causes it to fall into columns. Each pillar or column contains a stem and a branch—and each column relates to the year, month, day and hour of birth. The first column refers to the year animal and element, the second to the month animal and element, the third to the day animal and element, and the last to the hour animal and element.
Within the 'Four Pillars', the Year column purports to provide information about one's ancestor or early age, and the Month column about one's parents or growing age. The Day column purports to offer information about oneself (upper character) and one's spouse (lower character) or adult age, and the Hour column about children or late age.
Four Animal Trines.
First Trine.
The first trine consists of the Rat, Dragon and Monkey. These three signs are said to be intense and powerful individuals capable of great good, who make great leaders but are rather unpredictable. The three are said to be intelligent, magnanimous, charismatic, charming, authoritative, confident, eloquent and artistic, but can be manipulative, jealous, selfish, aggressive, vindictive or deceitful.
Second Trine.
The second trine consists of the Ox, Snake and Rooster. These three signs are said to possess endurance and application, with slow accumulation of energy, meticulous at planning but tending to hold fixed opinions. The three are said to be hard-working, modest, industrious, loyal, philosophical, patient, good-hearted and morally upright, but can also be self-righteous, egotistical, vain, judgmental, narrow-minded or petty.
Third Trine.
The third trine consists of the Tiger, Horse and Dog. These three signs are said to seek true love, to pursue humanitarian causes, to be idealistic and independent but tending to be impulsive. The three are said to be productive, enthusiastic, independent, engaging, dynamic, honourable, loyal and protective, but can also be rash, rebellious, quarrelsome, anxious, disagreeable or stubborn. 
Fourth Trine.
The fourth trine consists of the Rabbit, Goat and Pig. These three signs are said to have a calm nature and an intellectual approach; they seek aesthetic beauty and are artistic, well-mannered and compassionate, yet detached and resigned to their condition. The three are said to be caring, self-sacrificing, obliging, sensible, creative, empathetic, tactful and prudent, but can also be naïve, pedantic, insecure, cunning, indecisive or pessimistic.
Zodiac origin stories.
There are many stories and fables to explain the beginning of the zodiac. Since the Han Dynasty, the 12 Earthly Branches have been used to record the time of day. However, for the sake of entertainment and convenience, they have been replaced by the 12 animals. The 24 hours are divided into 12 periods, and a mnemonic refers to the behaviour of the animals:
A Branch may refer to a double-hour period. In the latter case it is the center of the period; for instance, 马 (the Horse) means noon or a period from 11am to 1pm.
The Great Race.
An ancient folk story tells that Cat and Rat were the worst swimmers in the animal kingdom. Although they were poor swimmers, they were both quite intelligent. To get to the meeting called by the Jade Emperor, they had to cross a river to reach the meeting place. The Jade Emperor had also decreed that the years on the calendar would be named for each animal in the order they arrived to the meeting. Cat and Rat decided that the best and fastest way to cross the river was to hop on the back of Ox. Ox, being naïve and good-natured, agreed to carry them both across. Midway across the river, Rat pushed Cat into the water. Then as Ox neared the other side of the river, Rat jumped ahead and reached the shore first. So he claimed first place in the competition and the zodiac.
Following closely behind was strong Ox who was named the 2nd animal in the zodiac. After Ox, came Tiger, panting, while explaining to the Jade Emperor how difficult it was to cross the river with the heavy currents pushing it downstream all the time. But with its powerful strength, Tiger made to shore and was named the 3rd animal in the cycle.
Suddenly, from a distance came a thumping sound, and the Rabbit arrived. It explained how it crossed the river: by jumping from one stone to another in a nimble fashion. Halfway through, it almost lost the race, but the Rabbit was lucky enough to grab hold of a floating log that later washed him to shore. For that, it became the 4th animal in the Zodiac cycle. In 5th place was the Flying Dragon. Of course, the Jade Emperor was deeply curious as to why a swift flying creature such as the Dragon should fail to reach first place. The mighty Dragon explained that he had to stop and make rain to help all the people and creatures of the earth, and therefore he was held back. Then, on his way to the finish, he saw a little helpless Rabbit clinging onto a log so he did a good deed and gave a puff of breath to the poor creature so that it could land on the shore. The Jade Emperor was very pleased with the actions of the Dragon, and he was added into the zodiac cycle. As soon as he had done so, a galloping sound was heard, and the Horse appeared. Hidden on the Horse's hoof was the Snake, whose sudden appearance gave the Horse a fright, thus making it fall back and giving the Snake the 6th spot, while the Horse placed 7th.
Not long after that, a little distance away, the Goat, Monkey, and Rooster came to the shore. These three creatures helped each other to get to where they are. The Rooster spotted a raft, and took the other two animals with it. Together, the Goat and the Monkey cleared the weeds, tugged and pulled and finally got the raft to the shore. Because of their combined efforts, the Emperor was very pleased and promptly named the Goat as the 8th creature, the Monkey as the 9th, and the Rooster the 10th.
The 11th animal was the Dog. Although he was supposed to be the best swimmer, he could not resist the temptation to play a little longer in the river. Though his explanation for being late was because he needed a good bath after a long spell. For that, he almost didn't make it to the finish line. Just as the Jade Emperor was about to call it a day, an oink and squeal was heard from a little Pig. The Pig got hungry during the race, promptly stopped for a feast and then fell asleep. After the nap, the Pig continued the race and was named the 12th animal of the zodiac cycle. The Cat drowned in 13th place and did not make it in the zodiac. It is said that that is the reason why Cats always chase Rats; to get back at them for what they have done.
Another folk story tells that on registration day, the Rat met up with the Ox. He thought to himself "Ox is the fastest, strongest animal!" So the little Rat played a trick on the Ox. He asked the Ox if he would like to listen to him sing. The Rat opened his mouth but said nothing. "How was that?" he asked the Ox and of course he replied "Sorry little Rat, I didn't hear you." The Rat told the Ox to let him jump onto his back so that he could sing it more clearly, and the Ox agreed. Soon without knowing, the Ox was walking to the signing post, forgetting the Rat on his back. When they reached there, the Rat jumped off and claimed first place. The Ox following and the rest.
In Buddhism, legend has it that Buddha summoned all of the animals of the earth to come before him before his departure from this earth, but only 12 animals actually came to bid him farewell. To reward the animals who came to him, he named a year after each of them. The years were given to them in the order they had arrived.
The 12 animals for the Chinese zodiac must have been developed in the early stage of Chinese civilization for hundreds of years until it become the current edition; and it’s very hard to investigate the real origin. Most historians agree that Cat is not in the list since the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac were formed before Cats were introduced to China from India with Buddhism.
Another story tells that God called the animals to a banquet that night. The Rat, who loved to play tricks on his neighbour, told the cat that the banquet was on the day after tomorrow. The Cat believed his neighbour the Rat and slept whilst dreaming of the banquet. The next day, the Rat arrived first followed by the Ox, the Tiger and the rest of the animals. The order of the animals was decided by the order that they arrived. The Cat was devastated and vowed that he would always hate the Rat. This is why cats chase Rats in folklore.
Problems with English translation.
Due to confusion with synonyms during translation, some of the animals depicted by the English words did not exist in ancient China. For example, 羊 can mean ram, sheep or goat. Similarly, 鼠 (rat) can also be translated as mouse, as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in Chinese. Further, 豬 (pig) is sometimes translated to boar after its Japanese name, and 牛 plainly means cow or ox, and not water buffalo, 水牛.
雞(rooster) may mean chicken, hen or cock. However, rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms, same for 羊, 鼠, etc.
Chinese zodiac in other countries.
The Chinese zodiac signs are also used by cultures other than Chinese. For one example, they usually appear on Korean New Year and Japanese New Year's cards and stamps. The United States Postal Service and those of several other countries issue a "Year of the ____" postage stamp each year to honor this Chinese heritage.
The Chinese lunar coins, depicting the zodiac animals, inspired the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins, as well as varieties from Australia, Korea, and Mongolia. The Chinese zodiac is an internationally popular theme, available from many of the world's government and private mints.
The Chinese zodiac is also used in some other Asian countries that have been under the cultural influence of China. However, some of the animals in the zodiac may differ by country.
East Asia.
The Korean zodiac is identical to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the "Water Buffalo" instead of the "Ox", and the fourth animal is the "Cat" instead of the "Rabbit". The Japanese zodiac includes the "boar" instead of the "Pig", and the Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on the 1st of January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai zodiac includes a "naga" in place of the "Dragon" and begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either on the first day of fifth month in Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.
Bulgars, Huns and Turkic people.
The European Huns used the Chinese zodiac complete with "Dragon" "Pig". This common Chinese-Turkic Zodiac was in use in Balkan Bulgaria well into the Bulgars' adoption of Slavic language and Orthodox Christianity.
Following is the Hunnish or Bulgarian Pagan zodiac calendar, distinctive from the Greek zodiac but much in conformity with the Chinese one:
Torè calendar.
Names of years
In Kazakhstan, an animal cycle similar to the Chinese is used, but the Dragon is substituted by a snail (), and Tiger appears as a leopard ().
In Mongolia 12 year beasts are called "Арван хоёр жил" meaning "12 years"

<doc id="21360768" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21360768" title="Santa Marta Formation">
Santa Marta Formation

The Santa Marta Formation is a geologic formation in Antarctica. It, along with the Hanson Formation and the Snow Hill Island Formation, are the only formations yet known on the continent where dinosaur fossils have been found. The formation outcrops on James Ross Island off the coast of the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In its entirety, the Santa Marta Formation is on average one kilometer thick.
Stratigraphy.
The Santa Marta Formation was deposited during the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous. It overlies the Gustav Group laid down during the Barremian and Santonian ages and is succeeded by the Snow Hill Island Formation of late Campanian age. Together, the Santa Marta Formation, Snow Hill Island Formation, the overlying López de Bertodano Formation (deposited from the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous to the early Paleocene epoch of the early Paleogene), and the Sobral Formation (deposited during the early Paleocene) form the Marambio Group.
Originally the formation was subdivided into three informal members termed the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma members. The names were later changed to the Lachman Crags, Herbert Sound, and Rabot members. The Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members, named after the areas in which they outcrop, are found in the northern part of James Ross Island. Both members are late Campanian in age. The Lachman Crags Member, the older of the two, is around 500 meters thick. The lower section of the member consists of tuffaceous mudstone while the upper section consists of tuffaceous turbidites formed by underwater avalanches. Bioturbation is evident in tuff beds throughout the member due to the disruption of sediments by benthic life during the time of deposition. The Herbert Sound member is also around 500 meters thick and also can be divided into two distinct sections. Channeled debris flows interbedded with turbides make up the lower portion of the member and are overlain by fine sandstones (followed by coarser sandstones and coquinas) that make up the upper portion of the member.
The depositional environment is thought to have been a system of abyssal fans radiating out from a large river delta. The rapid aggradation of sediments from the delta produced a steep delta slope, which may have resulted in occasional debris flows that formed the turbides. A high degree of tectonic activity in the region at the time may explain the intermittent tuff beds throughout the formation.
The Rabot Member of the Santa Marta Formation is confined to the southeastern part of James Ross Island and dates back to the early to late Campanian. Outcroppings of the member are separated from those of other members in the northern part of the island. Originally the member was regarded as its own formation, and now it is considered to be the lateral equivalent of both the Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members. Like the Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members, the Rabot member consists of mudstones and beds of tuff that are often highly bioturbated, and also consists of rare conglomerates. Recently a fourth member has been assigned to the formation called the Hamilton Point Member. The beds of this member used to be considered part of the upper portion of the Rabot member, but now are considered to be their own distinct member.
Flora and fauna.
A wide variety of microorganisms inhabited the coastal waters at the time of the deposition of the Santa Marta Formation. Microfossils include ostracods and dinoflagellates.
Invertebrates were also common. Fossils of ammonites can be found in the formation, often embedded vertically in the bedding plane. Originally it was thought that dead ammonites could only be oriented this way in sediment if they were in shallow waters below a certain pressure, but there is evidence to support that due to specific conditions during burial, it was possible for these ammonites to be vertically oriented at greater depths. Ammonite genera present in the formation include "Anagaudryceras", "Anapachydiscus", "Eupachydiscus", "Gaudryceras", "Maorites", "Natalites", "Parasolenoceras", "Yezoites", and the heteromorph ammonites "Ainoceras", "Eubostrychoceras", "Ryugasella" and "Baculites". Many bivalve fossils have been found such as "Cucullaea", "Panopea", "Pinna", and "Pterotrigonia". Polychaete annelid worms such as "Rotularia" and gastropods such as the cerithiid sea snail "Cerithium" have also been discovered in beds within the formation.
Numerous ichnofossils provide evidence of benthic activity, along with the bioturbated sediments previously mentioned. Vertical spreite trace fossils have been found as part of fodinichnia dominated ichnocoenosis and were assigned to ichnogenre such as "Paradictyodora". Trackways thought to belong to decapods have also been found.
Fish were present, including one of the first frilled sharks, "Chlamydoselachus thomsoni". Other marine vertebrates included the small mosasaur "Taniwhasaurus antarcticus", previously known as "Lakumasaurus antarcticus". The close relation of "T. antarcticus" to other species of "Taniwhasaurus" found in New Zealand and Patagonia provides evidence for a Gondwanan endemism.
"Antarctopelta oliveroi", an ankylosaur, was discovered in 1986 on the northern part of James Ross Island about 2 kilometers south of Santa Marta Cove in beds that were part of the Santa Marta Formation. It was the first dinosaur found in Antarctica. It may be a possible nodosaur but there has been no formal phylogenic analysis to prove its relationship with other ankylosaurs. Although the formation is made up of only marine deposits, the bodies of these animals along with other debris may have frequently been washed out to sea to later sink to the bottom and be buried by sediment.
Leaves and fragments of plants are commonly found as fossils throughout the formation as well as large tree trunks in the lower members. This is evidence of the forested environment that covered Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous due to the overall warmer global temperature and milder climate. At that time the river delta had much vegetation, and was able to support large herbivores such as "Antarctopelta".

Max Teichmann

Max Edwin Teichmann (20 August 1924 – 29 November 2008) was an Australian academic and political commentator. A former politics lecturer at Monash University, Teichmann was known for his independent views and trenchant criticisms of both the Left and the Right.
Early years.
Born in Melbourne to a German-born father, also Max, and an Adelaide-born mother, Kathleen, Teichmann grew up in the working-class suburb of Carlton during the Great Depression. After leaving school, he worked as a junior journalist, then in 1942 joined the Australian army and saw action in Papua New Guinea.
Education.
After the war, as an ex-serviceman, he enrolled in the University of Melbourne where he embarked on an academic career. He won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, United Kingdom where he was taught by Isaiah Berlin, Max Beloff and John Plamenatz. While in the United Kingdom, Teichmann became involved in left-wing politics, joining Britain's Labour Party and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
Political commentary.
In 1964, he returned to Australia and took up a post in the department of politics at Monash University. He became active in the anti-Vietnam War movement in Australia and counted among his friends leading Australian Labor Party identities such as Jim Cairns and Bill Hayden.
Teichmann eventually did adopt more conservative views and he become a fierce critic of the Left in Australia. Writing in the "Australian Financial Review" on 19 July 1999, Christopher Pearson listed Teichmann as one of several contemporary Australian political commentators who had commenced on the Left but had become conservatives later on in their careers. Pearson asserted that "Teichmann's position evolved primarily in response to the Left". So much so that his "critique of parasitism in the institutional Left, old and new, made him a heretical presence at Monash".
Columnist.
Teichmann retired from Monash in 1989. He went on to work as a regular columnist with "The Adelaide Review" from the mid-1990s until 2002. He also regularly wrote articles for "Quadrant", "News Weekly" and "National Observer" up until his death in November 2008.

Ram Charan Maharaj

Shri Ram Charan Maharaj ()( February 24, 1720 - 1799 A.D.) or ( Māgh Shukla 14, 1776 - Vaisakha Krishna 5,1855 Bikram Samwat) is the founder of a unique religious tradition in India called Ram Snehi Sampradaya. He initiated,illustrated and preferred the Nirguna (Absolute) Bhakti, although he was not against Saguna Bhakti. He initiated and tried to eliminate "show", blind faith, hypocrisy and misled existing in the Hindu Religion and preferred to worship 'Name of god' that is "RAMA" over god, to not get involved in false "show" activities.
Birth and Childhood of Ram Charan Maharaj.
Swami Ram Charan Maharaj born in Sodha, a village in Tonk district of Rajasthan on February 24, 1720 A.D.(Māgh Shukla 14, 1776 Bikram Samwat). His father's name was BakhatRam Vijayvergia and his mother's name was Devhuti Devi. His parents were living in Banwara village near Malpura, Rajasthan. His childhood name was ""Ram Kishan"".
He started having interest to know god and religious things in his childhood. He had got a good knowledge of different languages, such as Hindi, Urdu, Pharsi and Sanskrit during his studies. He studied all main Hindu scriptures like Ramayana, Mahabharat and Bhagavad Gita with the help of others.
Working as a "Divan of Jaipur".
Parents of Ram Charan Maharaj had identified his inclination towards god in his early age but they wanted him to get married and live a normal life. His parents forced him to get married. He got married to "Gulab Kanwar" . He became Patwari after marriage and worked with dedication, character and calibration. After some time, the contemporary king of Jaipur(Amber, India) Jai Singh II of Amber got to know about the good work of Ram Charan Ji and offered him the post of Divan of Jaipur of Malpura Branch
Leaving Home Forever.
Ram Charan Maharaj started to lose interest in materialism after his father's death in 1743 AD and got to know about the forecast of "Bhringi" Saint about his destiny. He also had a dream on the same night, in which he saw that one saint saved him from drowning in a river. Next day, he got permission from his family indirectly to leave Home forever and started his journey towards the way to know god and to find a perfect spiritual Guru in 1808 Bikram Samwat. Some believed that he left his house leaving his wife and a daughter behind.
Finding Spiritual Guru Near Shahpura And Afterwards.
He started his journey southwards by asking the people about the saint he saw in his dream by explaining what he would be looking like. At last he found the saint "Shri Kripa Ram" in Dantra village near Shahpura in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan. He became disciple of Kripa Ram Maharaj and started to follow him. He did 9 years of tapasya by living in the command of saint Kripa Ram.
Kripa Ram Maharaj was a disciple of Sant Das Ji Maharaj.
During those 9 years, Ram Charan Maharaj did many miracles which are still commonly known among the local people and "Ram Snehi Samprday". He also became very popular for his unique nirguna Bhakti. He used to visit many places and used to explain his experience and advised people to
eliminate "show", blind faith, hypocrisy and misled existing in the Hindu Religion.
Formation or "Ram Snehi" Spiritual Tradition.
He came to Bhilwara in 1817 (Bikram Samwat)and selected one lonely place named Miya Chand's bawri ( Step Well) for tapasya. By this time, he had reached the extreme level of Tapasya and reaching on the way to Nirvana.
Philosophy.
Swami Ram Charan Ji advocated saying राम राम (Raam Raam) as the way of reaching the ultimate. He preached selfless devotion as a means to realise God. He promoted Bhakti in general, trying to eliminate conflicts between Saguna and Nirguna types. Vaani Ji, the collection of works composed by him, focuses on knowledge, devotion and detachment.
The spiritual master, Guru has been given the highest status by Swamiji in his own life, as is said in his shlokas. Often, the Guru is equated with 'Raam'.
The student or seeker is told to avoid reading up huge texts and instead focus on chanting Raam Raam as the simplest means to self-realization. The supreme being is present everywhere, in every living being.
Swamiji followed the Vishishtadvaita school of thoughts.
Non violence to any living being, including insects is a central tenet.
The Bhagvatam is referred to most frequently, compared to other ancient Indian texts.
Social Reform.
Swami RamCharan Ji was against blind idolatry, which was in prevalence during his time. His philosophy was that we must love God, and not merely create a show. He taught people to treat equally, a king as well as a poor person. Also, he said that we must not discriminate on the basis caste/creed of people.
RamCharan Ji Maharaj also emphasised that instead of going to various places and searching for God, one must look inside oneself. Following Maharaj Ji, it is only necessary to engage in spiritual practises, at one's own place, with proper and essential guidance of one's Guru.
Works.
Swami Ram Charan Ji's works are collected in 'Vaani Ji'(वाणी जी) consisting of 36250 compositions. Each of these was spoken by him to his disciples.
The first 8,000 were noted by his disciple from Bhilwara, Naval Ram Ji. His collection in "Anubhav Vaani" is considered to be biggest religious book written on the teaching of any saint.
The remaining ones were noted, collected and edited by his disciple Ram Jan Ji Maharaj (who also succeeded him as the head of the 'Ramsnehi Sampradaya' after his death).
In Bikram Samwat 1981 (1925 CE), the complete Vaani Ji was published for the first time under the title :'Swami Ji Ram Charan Ji Maharaj ki Anubhav Vaani', from Shahpura.
The latest edition has been published by Ram Niwas Dham, Shahpura (Bhilwara), in 2005 CE.
Since this compilation, due to its large size, was found to be difficult for an individual to use, various smaller one were released, with at least one being published, by Sant LakshyaRam in Bikram Samwat 2015, on Vijayadashami day, from 'Chhatribagh' Ramdwara at Indore as 'Ram Rahasya Darshan'.
Vaani Ji contains Swamiji's teachings in the form of poetry of various types(metres). There are also 'Bhajans' with indications of the Raaga which should be preferably used for them.
Formation of Ramsnehi Sampradaya.
In same year (1817 Bikram Samwat), disciple Ram Jan Ji of Ram Charan Maharaj formed "Ram Snehi Sampradaya" ( Ram Snehi Spiritual Tradition).
The place of worship of believers of Swamiji is called a Ramdwara.
Since Swamiji's times, the organisation has headquarters at Shahpura in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan.
The Ramsnehi Sampradaya is currently led by Swami Ji Shri Ram Dayal Ji Maharaj.

Pingjiang County

Pingjiang County () is under the administration of Yueyang, Hunan province, China. It occupies the southeastern corner of Yueyang City, and borders the prefecture-level cities of Xianning (Hubei) to the northeast, Jiujiang and Yichun (Jiangxi) to the east, and Changsha to the south.
Administration.
The county executive, legislature and judiciary are in Hanchang Town, together with the CPC and PSB branches.
History.
In the Chinese Civil War, Pingjiang was a part of the "Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area" (湘鄂赣革命根据地), and, from 1931 November, of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet (湘鄂赣苏维埃)
The Communist Marshal Peng Dehuai was a Kuomintang Colonel in 1928, when he was stationed in Pingjiang with orders to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following Chiang Kai-shek's nationwide suppression of Communists. Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches. Peng rebelled against the Kuomintang in July 28, 1928, beginning his career as a military leader in the Red Army from his base in Pingjiang. Some of Peng's subordinates in the rebellion survived and became important military figures themselves, including generals Huang Kecheng and Peng Shaohui.

Clive Dunn

Early life and education.
Born in Brixton, London, Dunn was the son of actors, and the cousin of actress Gretchen Franklin. As a child, he almost died from post-operative complications after a supernumerary nipple was removed.
Dunn was educated at Sevenoaks School, an independent school for boys (now coeducational). After leaving school, Dunn studied at the independent Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, in London.
Career.
Dunn played small film roles from the 1930s onwards, appearing alongside Will Hay in the films "Boys Will Be Boys" (1935) while still a schoolboy, and "Good Morning, Boys" (1937). After a break for service in the army with the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, during the Second World War, during the course of which he was captured in Greece and spent four years in prisoner-of-war and labour camps in Austria, he worked for many years in music halls and theatres. In 1956 and 1957, Dunn appeared in both series of "The Tony Hancock Show" and the army reunion party episode of "Hancock's Half Hour" in 1960. In the 1960s he made many appearances with Tony Hancock, Michael Bentine, Dora Bryan and Dick Emery, among others, before winning the role of Jones in "Dad's Army" in 1968.
From early on in his career, his trademark character was that of a doddering old man. This first made an impression in the show "Bootsie and Snudge", a spinoff from "The Army Game". Dunn played the old dogsbody Mr Johnson at a slightly seedy gentlemen's club where the characters Pte. "Bootsie" Bisley (Alfie Bass) and Sgt. Claude Snudge (Bill Fraser) found work after leaving the Army.
In 1967 he made a guest appearance in an episode of "The Avengers", playing the proprietor of a toy shop in "Something Nasty in the Nursery". He was also one of the alien voices in the Cadbury's Smash advertisements in the 1970s, alongside "Dad's Army" co-star Bill Pertwee.
Dunn was one of the younger members of the "Dad's Army" cast when, at 48, he took on the role of the elderly butcher whose military service in earlier wars made him the most experienced member of the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, as well as one of the most decrepit. Jack Haig and David Jason had previously been considered for the role.
Dunn's staunch socialist beliefs often caused him to fall out with Arthur Lowe, who played Captain Mainwaring and who was an active Conservative. When the series ended and Dunn finally accepted an OBE, after many offers, it was reported that Lowe would only accept a higher-rated honour from the Queen.
After "Dad's Army" ended, Dunn capitalised on his skill in playing elderly character roles by playing the lead character Charlie Quick in the slapstick children's TV series "Grandad", from 1979 to 1984 (he played the caretaker at a village hall, and sang the lyrics in the theme). He had previously had a number one hit single with the song "Grandad" on his 51st birthday in January 1971, accompanied by a children's choir. The song was written by bassist Herbie Flowers. He performed the song four times on "Top of the Pops". The B-side of "Grandad", "I Play The Spoons", also received considerable airplay. After the cancellation of "Grandad" in 1984, he effectively disappeared from the screen, retiring to Portugal. Following the success of the "Grandad" record, Dunn released several other singles.
Personal life.
He married fashion model Patricia Kenyon in London in 1951. The couple divorced in 1958. He married actress Priscilla Pughe-Morgan (born 14 January 1934) in June 1959 and they had two daughters, Polly and Jessica.
A 2006 article described Dunn as having eye trouble and sometimes being unable to see, but otherwise appearing to be in good health. In August 2008, he recorded a message for the programme "Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad's Army", which was shown to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of "Dad's Army".
Dunn's cousin Gretchen Franklin was a television actress, best remembered as Ethel Skinner in the BBC soap opera "EastEnders". Dunn inherited a share in her estate on her death in 2005.
He spent his last three decades in the Algarve, Portugal. He occupied himself as an artist painting portraits, landscapes and seascapes until his sight failed.
Death.
Dunn died in Portugal on 6 November 2012 from complications following an operation which took place earlier that week. His agent, Peter Charlesworth, said the star would be "sorely missed" and that his death was "a real loss to the acting profession".
Frank Williams, who played the Vicar in "Dad's Army", said he was always "great fun" to be around. "Of course he was so much younger than the part he played," he told BBC Radio Four. "It's very difficult to think of him as an old man really, but he was a wonderful person to work with – great sense of humour, always fun, a great joy really".
Ian Lavender, who played Private Pike in the show, said: "Out of all of us he had the most time for the fans. Everyone at one time or another would be tempted to duck into a doorway or bury their head in a paper but not Clive, he always made time for fans".

Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.

Robert McGill Thomas, Jr. (May 9, 1939 – January 7, 2000) was an American journalist who worked for many years at "The New York Times", and who has become particularly noted for the obituaries he wrote for that newspaper. He wrote under the name Robert McG. Thomas; more than thirty of his obituaries were included in the anthology, "The Last Word" (1997). Since his death, a larger collection of Thomas' obituaries was published as "52 McGs.: The Best Obituaries from Legendary New York Times Reporter Robert McG. Thomas". The author of a starred Kirkus Review wrote, "For the last half of the 1990s, readers of the "New York Times" could be excused if they searched out Thomas’s work before they bothered with the front-page lead. Known as “McGs.”—after the veteran reporter’s middle name—these little beauties celebrated the unsung, the queer, the unpretentious, the low-rent."
Michael T. Kaufman, who undertook the daunting task of writing the obituary in the "New York Times" for the "Times' " celebrated obituary writer, described Thomas as the person "who extended the possibilities of the conventional obituary form, shaking the dust from one of the most neglected areas of daily journalism."

Kandadji Dam

The Kandadji dam when completed, will be a large multipurpose dam on the Niger River. The site is situated near the small town of Kandadji, Tillabéri Department, Tillabéri Region, Niger, 180 km northwest of the capital Niamey. Construction of the dam was begun in August 2008. It is being built by the "Haut Commissariat à l'Aménagement de la Vallée du Niger" (High Commission for Niger Valley), a public body under the Primer Minister's Office. The dam will generate hydropower and is aimed at controlling the flow of the Niger River, holding water during the dry season to maintain a minimum flow and making downstream irrigation possible. The project is formally named the "Kandadji Programme for Ecosystem Regeneration and Niger River Development" ("Programme Kandadji de Régénération des Ecosystèmes et de Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Niger"). The dam itself was expected to be completed in 2013 as of 2008 and as of September 2015 in 2012.
The project is a very high profile project for Niger. According to the Prime Minister at the time of initiating construction, Seyni Oumarou, "no other development project will have sparked so much long term interest or such high expectations". The first brick of the dam was laid by the President of Niger, Mamadou Tandja.
History.
The project was first proposed in the 1970s, when a larger dam had been considered. In 1998 the African Development Bank approved funding for a feasibility study that was conducted by the German consulting firm Lahmeyer. Under the study, an environmental and social diagnosis and an initial environmental and social assessment were conducted. The findings were presented in 2002. In August 2002 the government decided by Decree to go ahead with the project, which was from now on called the Kandadji Ecosystems Regeneration and Niger Valley Development Programme. Subsequently, a detailed environmental and social impact assessment including, a Population Resettlement Plan and a Local Development Plan, was conducted. The Local Development Plan was designed to facilitate the economic transition of displaced persons in order to restore their standard of living or even enhance it, beyond mere resettlement. The final design of the dam was prepared with financing from the Islamic Development Bank, and that of a 2000 ha irrigation project with financing from the West African Development Bank. In 2005 and 2006 consultations were undertaken as part of the environmental and social assessment, which included participants from the World Wide Fund for Nature and International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to one source, construction of the dam was begun in August 2008. In April 2009 a workshop on benefit sharing from dams in West Africa was held in Niamey organized by the Niger Basin Authority, the International Institute for Environment and Development and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The workshop recommended to improve the communication towards the people affected by the dam and to pay particular attention to legal processes related to resettlement, and to continue to reflect on a future management structure to equitably share the benefits of the dam. In November 2009 a process to select consultants to accompany the resettlement has been initiated.
According to the World Bank, the entire Kandadji Program will be implemented in three phases:
Construction of the dam itself was contracted to Russian company Zarubezhvodstroy, which signed the construction contract in September 2010. Construction of the dam was relaunched at a ceremony on 23 May 2011, following the election of President Mahamadou Issoufou. The Kandaji Dam is the first object being constructed by a Russian company in Niger. In May 2011, the Director General of Zarubezhvodstroy, OJSC E.V. Gudzenchuk, announced "For the first time a Russian company is involved in building such a large project in West Africa at the expense of foreign investors. Zarubezhvodstroy has vast experience in the field that would allow us to meet the challenges with confidence and with great professionalism."
Plans were announced in June 2011 to relocate 5383 individuals and 770 families who will be displaced by the dam.
Technical features.
The earth dyke dam will be 8.4 km dam long, creating a reservoir of 1.6 billion m3 and a regulated discharge of 120 m3/s (3.8 km3/year) in Niamey. The hydroelectric plant will have a capacity of 130 megawatt, and a 132 kilovolt high voltage line will be built over 188 km to Niamey. Irrigation development will consist of a first phase of 6,000 hectares mainly for the benefit of resettled communities, with a medium-term target in 2034 of 45,000 hectares out of an irrigable potential of 122,000 hectares.
Benefits.
The expected benefits include increased agricultural production and hydropower generation. Niger imports almost half of its electricity consumption of 440 million kWh (2007) from neighboring Nigeria, which itself suffers frequent power cuts. The plant would increase installed capacity in Niger from 240 Megawatt (MW) in 2007 to 370 MW (+55%). Other expected benefits are related to "drinking water supply, sanitation, improved flood recession cropping, grazing and fishery".
Financial costs.
The financial costs of the broader project, including the infrastructure for irrigation and drinking water supply, were estimated at US$670 million by one source in 2007. Another source mentions US$942 million in 2011. The contract to build the dam itself, however, is apparently only worth Euro 130million. According to the World Bank, the Kandadji Program (Phase I and Phase II) is expected to cost US$785 million.
Financing.
Financing comes from ten sources: the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Bank for Investment and Development of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Government of Niger.
Specific amounts are as follows, as far as known:
Financing for the hydropower station itself is due to come from a public-private partnership.
Environmental, social and downstream impact.
Negative social impacts include the resettlement of almost 35,000 people from 15 villages, loss of infrastructure (a national road, boreholes, clinics, schools, mosques, slaughterhouses, markets and grain mills) and loss of about 7,000 ha of agricultural land. According to a 2007 report by UNEP's Dams and Development Project, which itself was a follow-up activity to a report by the World Commission on Dams, the Kandadji project "serves as a useful example of the projection and estimation of social effects, which appears to have been widely encompassing, covering both negative impacts and benefits." These impacts were "projected at an early stage in project planning, enabling issues and potential impacts to be addressed in subsequent planning phases."
The project is expected to improve the river's ecology, which has suffered from a 30% decline in river flows since the 1970s. The dam would regulate flows. According to press reports from Nigeria, the project would reduce the river flow to Nigeria by at least 10 percent, thus jeopardizing power production from two existing dams in Nigeria and meaning a "colossal loss (...) to the agricultural capacity of (Nigerian) states that border the River Niger". However, according to the 2008 environmental assessment of the project the "modifications of the quantities of water flowing into the Niger River as a result of the Kandadji dam will be minimal in Nigeria". The average loss through evaporation and modification of the Niger River water flows in Nigeria will be low (2.3% at Jebba) and there will be positive impacts by improving the minimum water level in Nigeria.

Mantell's moa

Mantell's moa ("Pachyornis geranoides") is an extinct species of New Zealand birds of the Family Moa. These moa lived in the North and the South Islands, and on Stewart Island. Its habitat was the lowlands (shrublands, grasslands, dunelands, and forests). It was a ratite and a member of the Struthioniform Order. The Struthioniformes are flightless birds, whose sternum lacks a keel and whose palate is distinctive. The origin of the Stout-legged Moa is becoming clearer as it is now believed that early ancestors of these birds were able to fly and flew to the southern areas where their remains have been recovered.

Balankha

Balankha बालंखा (sometimes misspelled as "Walangkha") is a village development committee (VDC) in Bhojpur District in the Kosi Zone of eastern Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 1,867 persons living in 367 individual households.
It is one of the growing towns in the southwestern part of the district, and one of the most remote VDCs in the Bhojpur district. It is 16 miles southwest of the district headquarters, Bhojpur Bazaar, and takes about a day and half of hiking to get to from Balankha bazaar. The area of alankha is 13 square kilometers. 
Geography.
It borders Bopung (बोपुङ) Village of Khotang District. Its neighboring VDCs are Pancha (पाङ्चा), Dewantar(देवन्टार), Thidinkha (थिदिङ्खा), Yoo (यू), Dummana (दुम्माना), Pawala (पावला) and Wasing Tharpu(वाशिङ थर्पु). There are nine small villages better known as Wards. They are Sipak (सिपाक), Balankha (बालङ्खा), Chhongkha (छोङ्खा), Khakanla (खकन्ला), Phuintang (फुइन्ताङ), Karkigaun (कार्कीगाउ), Ragatung (रागातुङ), and Mayung (मैयुङ). The population of Balankha is about 2,000. The climate is semi tropical. The higher area of the hill is "Lek" – and low lands usually areas along the riverbeds are "besi". Lek is colder and Besi is warmer. Usually Besi is more fertile. 
Rice, corn (maize) and all tropical vegetables and fruits are grown in Besi. In Lek, soil is less fertile so people usually grow potatoes, corn, and millet.
History.
The name "Balankha".
There is a story behind the origin of the name "Balankha". A long time ago, A Kirat Rai brother was traveling through this area with his pig. He spent a night here with his pig tied to little pole near by him. In the morning when he woke up he did not see his pig. He began to look for his pig saying ""Baak Laamkhaa"" (बाक लाम्खा ) meaning "The pig got lost". He could not find his pig. He probably came back repeatedly to find his lost pig and asked help from locals too. In Rai Bantawa language ""Baak"" means a Pig and ""Laamkhaa"" means to get lost. So later on people began to call this place as "Baak laamkha" (place where the pig was lost). Over the course of time people started to pronounce as "Balankha" (बालंखा)
Local story of Shimbha Mala.
There was a Kirati Chamling King known as Shimbha Mala (शिम्भा माला) in Chamlung (चामलुंग) village near Bopung. He was very powerful and very protective of this area. When King Prithbi Narayan Shah’s forces were advancing towards eastern Nepal, he did not want to give up his territory easily. Back in those days, Chandi Danda (चण्डी डांडा) was the main gateway to this area and it was covered with thick jungle. Shimbha Mala and his few warriors armed with bows and arrows fought against Prithvi Narayan’s soldiers and tried to stop them here. He and his warriors used to hide in the trees and attack their enemies with their arrows. They had little success in the beginning, but later, Prithbi Narayan’s forces overpowered and killed him. They buried him along with his horse at the Chandi Danda. The grave still remains in the area but not many people know about it. 
The local Kirat Rais believe that the ghost of Shimbha Mala still roams in the area especially in the nights on nights with a full moon, a new moon and during kirat festivals. It is also believed that anyone who digs up the grave will die. A long time ago, the ghost phenomena used to occur every night. People could hear the horse steps and the sound of bells while the ghost was on the ride from Purne Dada (पुर्णे डांडा) to Raake Dada (राँके डांडा). People were scared to take a walk along the Mulbato (मूलबाटो) at late night for fear of seeing the ghost. A local Chhetri man named Kaale Bista (काले बिष्ट) who lived near the main trail "Mulbato" was tired of the ghost phenomena every night. One night he was determined to face the ghost directly. He took a big sword "KaTTi" (कट्टी) in his hand and waited for the ghost. When the ghost arrived on the horse they faced each other. There was no words for few seconds, and all of the sudden, Kale Bista raised his weapon to attack the ghost, and thusly, the ghost became nervous and started to run away. Kale Bista chased the ghost few hundred yards away. Since then the Ghost has never appeared again in his area of Balankha. The great grandson of Kale Bista, Gadul Bista (गडुल बिष्ट ) who died in 2065 B.S. used to tell this story to the locals.
Chandi Bazar.
A long time ago, during Panchayat system, Chandi Bazar village was the official name for this area, to include Thindingkha village. Later on, local administrations were redesigned to be a better system. After the restructuring of administrations, Chandi Bazar was partitioned into Thidingkha Village Panchayat and Balankha Village Panchayat. However, some older people still call it Amchok Balankha too because Aamchok is the Rana era or early Panchayat era administrative name.
Culture and society.
Balankha is blend of various castes and ethnic groups. The majority are Kirat Rais but there are Kshetri, Bahun, Kami, Damai, Tamang, Sarki, etc. who have been living in harmony for ages. Within Kirat Rais there are groups like Bantawa and Chamling.
Chhongkha Chandi (छोङ्खा चन्डी).
This is an important part of the cultural tradition of Kirat Rai people in this region. It is one of the most famous places to celebrate Kirat Rai's Sakela or Sakenwa festival. According to Kirat Rai historians, writers (Bam Bahadur Rai, Shyam Raj Rai and bulletins of Kirat Rai Yayokkhaa) and local people, it is about a 600-year-old tradition. The main ritual place is across the Buwa Khola (बुंवा खोला). It is called Chandi Than (चन्डी थान). In every Ubhauli (उभौली) festival, a designated Kirat Rai priest called Nakchhong (नाकछोङ) performs puja and prays to the Kirat Rai ancestors for rain, good crops, good health of the people and livestock and continuity of this great Creation. There are certain processes to perform the ritual, and all Kirat Rais have to follow it properly. 
After the ritual is done, they come to Chandi danda or Chandi bazar (चन्डी बजार), an open space near Balankha bazaar. They dance Sakewa dance with Dhol(ढोल) and jhyamta (झ्याम्टा). The dance style is a little different than other Sakewa dances seen in northern Bhojpur and neighboring Khotang district. Here, the rhythm is very slow, as are the dance movements themselves. Others might find the dance less interesting because it has more singing and less dance steps. Most of the Kirat Rais in the southern belt like Hatuwa, Ranibas, Basikhora, Pawala, Khairang, Chhongkha, and so on have similar dance style of Sakenwa.
Beside Kirat Rai, there is a tradition of "Bhote ko Mane" (भोटेको माने) from Tamang culture. There are a significant number of Tamang people in Balankha. "Mane" is a kind of stupa they build in memory of their deceased. There used to be a lot of Mane alongside of the mulbato (main trail to Bhojpur), especially in Tinchule jungle, Pasal Bhanjyang, Raake Bazar. The tradition seems to be disappearing slowly. New "Mane" (माने) are rarely seen anymore. The old ones were destroyed by treasure hunters almost two decades ago.
Bar Pipal, Chautari, Kuwa are the traditional landmarks in the area. Old Chautaris with beautiful inscriptions etched in stone slates in memory of deceased souls are still found. With old Bar (वर) and Pipal (पिपल) trees side by side and wooden Bench “Falaicha” (फलैंचा), a weary traveler could rest in comfort.
Education.
Chandeswor Ma. Vi (Grade 1- 10).
Balankha's high school began in 2039 BS. The late King Birendra granted permission to establish Chandeswor High School during his visit to Ghoretar. Now more than 100 students participate in the SLC exam of this school. There are other high schools in neighboring VDCs, e.g. Dummana and Wasing Tharpu. Balankha is now the SLC center for those high schools. The Head Master is Govinda Parajuli. The first Head Master was Suresh Chamling of Jhapa, and after him it was Mahendra Shakya of Taksar Bhojpur.
The SLC result of 2069 (2012) is about 13%. Out of 77 only 10 students succeeded SLC exam. 3 of them were able to secure first division. 
Chandeswor Uchcha Ma Vi (+2) चन्डेश्वोर उच्च मा. वि. २०६६.
Recently Chandeswor High School got approved for a +2 higher education system. With its establishment, students from seven other neighboring VDCs will have opportunity to complete their +2 degree in the local level.
The Chairman of School Management Board is Rabin Rai, who worked very hard to start +2 school. He conducted meetings with local leaders, teachers, students, and made a common agenda for the school. He took the matter not only to the district level officials, but even to the central level in Kathmandu and gave the agenda to the Nepal government's Higher Education Council. He was able to justify the necessity of +2 school to the officials. Finally the school got approval to run the +2 classes. He quickly managed to find teachers and start the first badge of 11th grade in Balankha in 2066 B.S. Since then the new +2 school has played a key role in the region. It is running an education faculty with students of about 100 (both 11th and 12th grades) and four teachers. The principal of the institute is Ram Prasad Kafle. 
Chandeswor Uchcha Ma Vi set the record among its peers in Bhojpur district in 11th grade examination of 2067 B.S. Out of 85 examinees 27 students passed the exam. This is merely 33% of the total but it is the highest percentage overall in Bhojpur district. Balankha is noe removed from being the SLC center.
Politics.
Present.
The Secretary of the Village Development Committee runs the day to day administrative tasks. For security reason, the Secretary works at District Headquarters Bhojpur. This has been very inconvenient to local people but since the there is no elected local body and no Constitution drafted yet. Few years ago a Sarbadaliya Samiti (a committee representing all Parties) was running the VDC. The active political parties in this village town are Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, UCPN(M) and Rastriya Prajatantra Party. 
Before the election of Constituent Assembly, this area was dominated by NCP-UML. But now Maoists appear to be dominating the local politics because majority of local voted for Maoist and helped their candidate win the election. But the Constituent Assembly is now defunct after May 27, 2012. Now there is more confusion in local level.
Past.
In 2015 BS, Krishna Lal Rai contested in the local election of Bhojpur from the Gorkha Parishad led by Dr. K I Singh. He lost the election with the total vote of 360.
Ramu Rai and Balankha.
It was Ramu Rai who led Balankha and whole southern belt to the main political arena of Bhojpur. He participated in General Election held in 1999 for the seat of Member of Parliament from Rastriya Prajatantra Party. A medical professional turned politician, Ramu was very popular among the people of Bhojpur, especially southern Bhojpur. Because of him, Balankha region finally got noticed in Bhojpur politics. He raised the local voice, local issues to the district authorities and central leaders. During the Panchayat regime he became synonymous with Balankha. People of far distant villages used to refer Balankha as "Ramu ko gaon" (Ramu's village). 
As his popularity was growing, the Panchayat system was coming to an end. After the end of the Panchayat system in 1991, he did not opt to join the other mainstream political parties. He rather chose to stay with his former Pancha's pro king party "Rastriya Prajatantra Party". The new political development slowly pushed aside all the pro king parties. It directly affected his political career, where most people were against the king. Many local youths who once were his staunch supporters, started to distance themselves. Later, he left Balankha and moved to Kathmandu.
Balankha at present.
After a decade long Maoist war and violence, Balankha is emerging as a center for educational and economic activities. 
Balankha has:
Balankha's +2 School is a big boost to local development. It is becoming a center spot for seven other neighboring VDCs. Road work is being done to connect it to Ghoretar. Once Ghoretar is linked to Legua Ghat, Balankha will automatically be linked to it.

C. Karunakara Menon

Diwan Bahadur Cozhisseri Karunakara Menon (1863-1922) was an Indian journalist and politician from the erstwhile Madras Presidency. He was the second editor of The Hindu after G. Subramania Iyer and the founder of the "Indian Patriot".
Karunakara Menon was born in Parappanangadi - Malabar district (Cozhisseri Tharavadu, Neduva) and had his higher education in Madras. He served as a sub-editor of "The Hindu" till 1898 and as editor from 1898 to 1905. In 1905, he started the "Indian Patriot" which was closed in 1924. He was a prominent public man and took part in the political events of his time.
Menon died in 1922 at his residence 'Cozhisseri' at Parappanangadi, Kerala State due to complications following a stroke. He was highly regarded by V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, Veeraraghavachariar, G. Subramania Iyer and Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Lawley.
Early life.
Karunakara Menon was born in a Nair family (Cozhisseri Tharavadu) of Parappanangadi,Malabar district, Madras Presidency. He graduated in law from the University of Madras and joined The Hindu as a sub-editor.
On graduation, he plunged into public life in 1890 when he opposed the Malabar Marriage Bill of T. Muthuswamy Iyer. Menon's opposition to the bill impressed Muthuswamy Iyer to such an extent that a close friendship developed between the two. During this time, Menon also developed friendship with T. Madhava Rao.
Rise to prominence.
When G. Subramania Iyer, the editor of "The Hindu", travelled to the United Kingdom to give evidence before the Welby Commission, Menon managed the newspaper in his absence with the assistance of Mr. Natarajan, who later became the editor of the "Indian Social Reform".
When Veeraraghavachariar took over The Hindu in October 1898, he appointed Karunakara Menon as the editor. Menon edited The Hindu till 1905 when he founded "The Indian Patriot".
In 1903, Veeraraghavachariar said of Karunakara Menon:
Editorship of "The Indian Patriot".
The Indian Patriot toed a difficult path. It was one of the few newspapers of the time which openly supported the Indian National Congress. It strongly opposed the perpetuators of the Alipore bomb case and claimed to stand on the side of law and order.
The British responded by honoring Karunakara Menon with a "Diwan Bahadur" for his assistance. However, Karunakara Menon turned against the British when he attacked the non-Brahmin movement which was fostered by them., while DR. T M Nair and Sir C Sankaran Nair, supported the Dravidian movement.
As a result, in old age,he became a target of the Criminal Intelligence Department of the Indian police.
Menon antagonized both the extremists as well as the British establishment and devoid of support, he was forced to sell his newspaper in order to meet expenses.
Death.
Menon died in 1922 at his residence Cozhissery House in Parappanangadi due to complications of stroke.
As a statesman.
V. Krishnaswamy Iyer had a very high opinion of Menon's abilities. He felt that Menon was a statesman of good calibre and that he was wasting his time in the journalism profession. He is believed to have remarked once:
Krishnaswamy Iyer's views were supported by the fact that the then Governor of Madras, Arthur Lawley consulted Menon regularly. It is believed that Menon had enough statesmanship ability to serve as a Diwan of Travancore or Chief Minister of Madras.
Ideology.
Menon supported the Home Rule Movement in Madras Presidency. Even while he opposed the political ambitions of the non-Brahmin movement he still supported their social reform activities.

Scoring (Industrial Process)

Scoring is a process in which one cuts a groove into rigid material (usually tile, stone, glass, etc.). This groove is used to either break the material along the slit, for decoration, or act as a guideline for other processes such as painting. It can also be used to allow materials to expand and contract under varying thermal conditions. Scoring is used in place of cutting through the material all the way because you can obtain relatively the same results with less time and labor.
Decorations.
Scoring is most commonly used in concrete work for decoration by making the grooves appear to be grout lines from tile work.

Fort Sill Apache Tribe

The Fort Sill Apache Tribe is the federally recognized Native American tribe of Chiricahua Warm Springs Apache in Oklahoma.
Government.
The Fort Sill Apache Tribe is headquartered in Apache, Oklahoma. Tribal member enrollment, which requires a 1/16 minimum blood quantum (equivalent to one great-great-grandparent), stands at 650. The tribe continues to maintain close connections to the Chiricahua Apache who were moved to the Mescalero Apache Reservation in the late 19th century.
Jeff Houser is the elected tribal chairman; the position has a two-year term, as do the elected tribal council positions.
Lands.
The tribal jurisdictional area, as opposed to a reservation, spans Caddo, Comanche, and Grady Counties in Oklahoma. A private landholder returned four acres of sacred land in Cochise County, Arizona to the tribe, and it is included in their trust lands.
In 2011, the tribe won the right to establish a reservation in New Mexico. They now control near Deming, New Mexico.
Economic development and tribal programs.
The tribe operates its own housing program, Fort Sill Apache Industries, and the Fort Sill Apache Casino in Lawton. The tribe's 2008 economic impact was $10 million.
Working with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2007 the Fort Sill Tribe began to set up an environmental protection office: to abate illegal dumping, encourage recycling, train certified water operators, and to educate the public about environmental issues.
History.
The Fort Sill Apache Tribe is composed of Chiricahua Apache, who were made up of 4 bands:
The Apache are southern Athabaskan-speaking peoples who migrated many centuries ago from the subarctic to the southwestern region of what would become the United States. The Chiricahua settled in southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico of the present-day United States, and northern Sonora, and northern Chihuahua of present-day Mexico. By the late 19th century, the Chiricahua Apache territory encompassed an estimated 15 millions acres.
In 1886 to break up the Apache Wars and resistance to European-American settlement, the US federal government took the Chiricahua into custody as prisoners of war and seized their land. The Army forcibly removed 400 members of the tribe from the Fort Apache and San Carlos Reservations in present-day Arizona, and transported them to U.S. Army installations in Alabama and Florida. Some warriors were held at Fort Pickens in Florida. Their ledger drawings are held in a collection by the Smithsonian Institution.
In 1894, the US Congress passed a special provision to allow the Chiricahua to be relocated to Indian Territory. They were the last Indian tribe to be relocated into what is now Oklahoma. When the Chiricahua arrived at Fort Sill, they had been promised the lands surrounding the fort as theirs to settle. Local non-Indians resisted Apache settlement, and the tribe was pressured to leave. Many wanted to return to their traditional lands in the Southwest, and the Mescalero Apache offered them land on their reservation.
A third of the Chiricahua stayed in Indian Territory, demanding that the US fulfill its promise to give them the Fort Sill lands. As a compromise, the government gave the remaining Chiricahua land which it had classified as surplus after allotment of tribal lands to individual households under the Dawes Act, on the nearby Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation. In 1914, the US government finally released 84 individuals from prisoner status and granted them household allotment lands around Fletcher and Apache, Oklahoma.
The Fort Sill Apache struggled for survival in the ensuing years in the economically depressed areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The tribe seized the opportunity afforded by Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936. Persevering through the difficulty of satisfying documentation requirements for tribal continuity, they were recognized by the federal government (Department of Interior) as a tribe in 1976.
The first chairperson, elected in 1976, was Mildred Cleghorn, one of the last Chiricahua Apache born under "prisoner of war" status. She was an educator and traditional doll maker, and was regarded as a cultural leader among the elders. She served as tribal chairperson until 1995 and focused on sustaining history and traditional Chiricahua culture.
Allan Houser was the first Fort Sill Apache child to be born free. He became one of the most celebrated Native American sculptors of the 20th century. His sons, Bob Haozous and Philip Haozous, are successful sculptors today and are both enrolled members of the tribe.

Norfolk thrush

The Norfolk thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus poliocephalus"), also known as the grey-headed blackbird or guava bird, was a bird in the thrush family endemic to Norfolk Island, an Australian territory in the Tasman Sea. It is the extinct nominate subspecies of the island thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus").
Description.
The Norfolk thrush was mainly dark brown in colour, with a pale grey-brown head and upper breast. It was about 21 cm in length, with a wingspan of 34 cm and a weight of 55 g. It had a yellow bill, orbital ring and legs. Males and females were similar in size and appearance.
Habitat.
The Norfolk thrush used to be common in forest and was often seen in gardens adjacent to rainforest remnants.
Behaviour.
Breeding.
The subspecies nested in trees, including the introduced lemon tree. The clutch size was 2-4.
Feeding.
The Norfolk thrush foraged mainly on the ground, in leaf litter, for small invertebrates, seeds and fallen fruit.
Status and conservation.
The subspecies became extinct around the late 1970s, with the last confirmed record in 1975. The cause of its extinction is attributed to a combination of clearing of native vegetation and predation by rats and feral cats. Additional factors were competition with introduced song thrushes and common blackbirds, as well as by interbreeding with the latter species producing sterile offspring.

<doc id="21361698" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21361698" title="California Proposition 66 (2004)">
California Proposition 66 (2004)

Proposition 66 was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. It was a proposed amendment to the California three-strikes law (implemented in 1994 with Proposition 184). Prop 66 would have required the third felony charge against a suspect to be special violent and/or serious crimes to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. It also would have changed the definition of some felonies. It was rejected by voters, with 52.7% voting against the proposition.
Though polls indicated that the measure would be overwhelmingly approved by California voters, public opinion shifted dramatically in the last days of the campaign. Opponents argued that its wording was so ambiguous that it threatened to shorten sentences for far more convicts than proponents estimated, and that it would have categorized some serious felonies—assault with intent to rape an elderly or disabled person, for example—as nonviolent crimes.
Days away from the election, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was joined by Henry Nicholas, co-founder and former Co-Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom Corporation and a victims’ rights advocate whose sister was murdered in 1983, as well as former Governors Jerry Brown, Pete Wilson, Gray Davis and George Deukmejian in launching an intensive radio and television advertising campaign against the ballot initiative. The ads warned that Prop. 66, if passed, “would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists.
Nicholas contributed $3 million to the campaign and flew former Gov. Brown to Long Beach from Oakland to record radio ads with him in the home recording studio belonging to Ryan Shuck of the rock group Orgy. Joining them was Dave Silvera, of the band Korn. Over the next several days, an ad blitz including spots from Shuck and Silvera blanketed radio stations across the state. At one point ahead in the polls by more than a 3-to-1 margin , Prop 66 failed to pass, with 5,604,060 voters (47.3 percent) voting for, 6,238,060 (52.7 percent) voting no, and 747,563 (5.9 percent) casting no vote. Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, called the come-from-behind campaign to defeat Prop 66 “unprecedented” in California electoral politics.

United States amphibious operations

The United States has a long history in amphibious warfare from the landings in the Bahamas during the American Revolutionary War, to some of the more massive examples of World War II in the European Theater of Operation on Normandy, and in Africa and Italy, as well as the constant island warfare of the Pacific Theater of Operations. Throughout much of its history, the United States prepared its troops in both the United States Marines and the United States Army to fight land from sea into the center of battle.
History.
The United States’ first role in amphibious warfare was inaugurated when the Continental Marines made their first amphibious landing on the beaches of the Bahamas during the Battle of Nassau on 2 March 1776. Even during the Civil War, the United States Navy’s ships brought ashore soldiers, sailors, and Marines to capture coastal forts. General Robert E. Lee, the Confederate Army commander, declared: 
The victory over Spain in the Spanish-American War had greatly enabled the expansion of the United States. By the time the Treaty of Paris was ratified in 1898 the United States had annexed the Philippines in the western Pacific to influence foreign relations in China and Korea; primarily through the presence of the Asiatic Squadron. The McKinley Administration included Guam and the Hawaiian Islands to the south Pacific insular areas of Samoa. Also, Congress approved the Foraker Act in the annexation of Puerto Rico for the defense and protection of the newly independent Cuba from any possible foreign attack. The government also negotiated with Nicaragua and Colombia for the right to build an isthmian canal through Panama. Due to the new, vast expansion of territory, the Navy began to assume strategic duties unimagined before 1898.
In 1900, the "General Board of the Navy" was established to foresee and make recommendations on naval policy, assuming the tasks of the nation's naval expeditionary and strategic challenges.
Around this time, the General Board developed some potential war plans for possible events that may be measured if such attacks were to be aimed for the continental east coast, the Antilles of the Caribbean, or the Panama Canal. The most dangerous, likely foe that the United States Navy faced was the British Royal Navy, and had been implemented into War Plan RED, however, relations had improved and both already committed to a growing rapprochement. It instead agreed that the next likely foe would be the Germany's Imperial Navy, a burgeoning force of warships that were at the disposal of Emperor Wilhelm II. In response to possible German naval invasion of the Caribbean or attacks on the east coast, the United States devised War Plan BLACK. To also include Germany having purchased Spain's remaining central Pacific island colonies, and the Mariana Islands and the Caroline Islands, and its establishment of a naval base in China in 1900. And after the Russo-Japanese War, victorious Imperial Japan had serious plans of expanding its influence south and in the west Pacific. The United States Navy solely relied on the islands for refueling stations for the coal-powered navy ships; the lifeline to the naval bases in the Philippines and Guam. If such an attack was initiated by the Japanese, a system of Pacific naval bases were needed to be built, in order to put War Plan ORANGE into effect.
The sum of it all, the Navy's war planning after 1900 assumed that maritime attacks on the United States and its interests were possible in both the Pacific and the Caribbean, and given the thousands of miles the fleet would have to steam to provide security to the outermost bases of Guam, the Philippines, or of the similar. The General Board was convinced that it would require Marine expeditionary battalions that were capable in the hastily development of advanced bases, and it could not depend on the small and overextended United States Army to defend the bases in short, limited order.
Advanced Base Force.
Expeditionary battalions<BR>
On the outset of the Spanish-American War, the Marines stormed the beaches of Cuba and captured Guantanamo Bay while the United States Army successfully landed at Santiago. It was First Lieutenant Dion Williams, who raised the United States Flag at Manila Bay in 1898. Lt. Williams later epitomized the "modernized" doctrine of amphibious operations, focusing on seizure, preparation, and defense of advance bases, which also adopted the concept of amphibious reconnaissance.
The Marine Corps had begun to come to the realization of utilizing methods of seizing and defending objectives on shore. The Marine Corps Commandant, Brigadier General William P. Biddle sent orders to Earl H. Ellis, a Marine Officer, to the Advance Force Base, which in later years was re-established as the Fleet Marine Force in regards to his report and thesis he had written at the Navy War College concerning the setting up of advanced bases. The Advanced Base School was created in conjunction for the Advanced Base Force in New London, Connecticut in 1910.
Fleet Marine Force.
By the 1930s, the Fleet Marine Force, which consists of the United States Navy and Marine Corps was developed. During this period, they began to modernize amphibious warfare that fabricated into the seminal "Tentative Landing Operations Manual" which was implemented in 1935. The doctrine set forth the organization, theory and practice of landing operations by establishing new troop organization and the development of amphibious landing crafts and tractors. Also, they emphasized the use of aerial and naval support in beach landings for the troops. The final element of the formula was the annual exercises called the 'Fleet Landing Exercises', or FLEX, which were conducted in the Caribbean, the California coast, and in the Hawaiian Islands. similar to the exercises conducted by LtCol Earl "Pete" Ellis on Culebra by the Advanced Base Force in January, 1914. This preparation proved invaluable in World War II, when the Marines not only spearheaded many of the attacks against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific theater of war, but also helped train the United States Army divisions that also participated in the island-hopping campaign.
Amphibious Corps.
Throughout the Pacific campaign during World War II, both the United States Army and Marine Corps trained the new graduated recruits in joint-amphibious operations. Even the Army conducted its own facility to accommodate the training necessary, establishing the Amphibious Training Center (ATC). It was pointed out that the number of amphibious troops in the United States was inadequate and that the Marine Corps was undermanned due to expansion problems in the Navy's budget. To further complicate problems in the development of amphibious warfare amongst the Marine Corps was that they were organized for aggressive, but limited objectives, instead of extensive operations that fully relied on larger ground forces that were capable of sustaining longer in combat, due to being well-funded and equipped. A notable result of the ATC was the deployment of Engineer Amphibian Brigades (later called Engineer Special Brigades), which were largely responsible for much of the amphibious resupply doctrine still in use by the United States Marine Corps today.
The United States Navy controlled many joint units of the Army and the Marine Corps. The combined Army/Marine units consisted of two amphibious corps, the Amphibious Corps of the Pacific Fleet and of the Atlantic Fleet. These units represented the sum total of the amphibious forces of the United States, with the exception of small units of the Fleet Marine Force, which had been trained for amphibious raids. It was apparent that the United States Marine Corps did not have sufficient troops trained for the type of operation which was necessary to win the war.
To sever the problems, the United States Navy controlled two joint Army-Marine "amphibious corps", in which the Army and Marine Corps's forces were attached under:
By 1943, primarily due to disagreements between the services, the Army ceded this role to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the Army closed its Amphibious Training Center. Subsequently, the Marine subordinate units of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF) were re-designated under the full command of the Marine Corps's V Amphibious Corps (VAC).

Svirel

Svirel () is an old folk Russian wind instrument of the end-blown flute type. In the Old Rus’ this instrument was made either of hollow reed or cylindrical wood branches. A legend says that Lel', son of the Slavic goddess of love Lada was a svirel player. In spring he would make his svirel of birch branches.
Traditional Russian svirel has not yet been studied well enough. Specialists have long tried to relate the present day’s pipe instruments to their Old Russian names. Most often the chroniclers used three names for this type instruments: svirel, sopel (sopilka) and tsevnitsa.
Construction.
Svirel is a simple wooden (sometimes metal) pipe. On the upper end it has a beak-like whistle device and in the middle of the face side it has several (usually six) finger-holes cut out. Wooden pipe is made of buckthorn, hazel, maple, ash tree, or bird cherry tree.
Etymology.
The word svirel is obviously older than sopel, since it can be found in the Common Slavonic language and, consequently, it had existed in the epoch preceding the division of this language into the Eastern, Western and Southern branches. Yet, it is difficult to say whether this name referred to a definite kind of instrument: in the Old Rus’ any wind instrument player but for horn or trumpet players was called svirets or sviryanin.
History.
So, svirel playing traditions of the Russians seem to be much older than the epoch of the Eastern Slavic community. Two such pipes were found during archeological excavations of the Old Novgorod in 1951-1962. One of them dating back to the late 11th century is 22.5 cm (approximately 9 inches) long and has four finger-holes. The second pipe dating to the early 15th century is 19 cm (approximately 7.5 inches) long and has only three holes.
However, it is difficult to say whether the Old Russian svirel was a double or a single pipe: there is no data about this preserved. What makes things still more complicated is the fact that names of similar instruments of kindred nations, such as Russians, Ukrainians and Byelorussians are often mixed.
N. I. Privalov fixed the name svirel to the double pipe, because this is how the instrument was called in Smolensk region, the major area of its popularity. This being the case the single svirel came to be called sopel. Nowadays svirel is more and more often referred to the end-blown flute type instrument with a whistle device nested into its upper part.
Playing technique.
Double svirel has two similar pipes of different lengths. Each of the pipes has a whistle and three finger-holes. Size of the double svirel varies on a great scale. The bigger pipe can be 29 to 47 cm long, and the smaller 22 to 35 cm. The big pipe is usually held in the right hand and the small one in the left hand.
Bringing together two pipes into one instrument makes it possible for one player to perform two-voice melodies. The repertoire of double svirel tunes is quite extensive and versatile. Double svirel was unevenly spread in Russia.
In the early 20th century Vasily Andreyev introduced into his orchestra svirels with key mechanism. Instruments of such construction still can be found in modern folk music orchestras.

The Duchy of Saxe-Eisenberg was one of the Saxon Duchies held by the Ernestine line of the Wettin Dynasty. Established in 1680 for Christian, fifth son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha, the Duchy consisted of Eisenberg and the towns of Ronneburg, Roda and Camburg. Upon the death of the childless duke in 1707, the lands were disputed between Christian's remaining brothers and their descendants in the ""Coburg Eisenberg Roemhilder inherit-ridden"", which only in 1735 could be resolved.

Ernst Levy (born Basel, Switzerland 18 November 1895, died Morges, Switzerland 19 April 1981) was a Swiss musicologist, composer, pianist and conductor.
He studied with Egon Petri and Raoul Pugno. David Dubal describes him as an "unusual and powerful pianist" who made "grandly conceived" recordings of the late Beethoven sonatas and captured "the very essence of the Faustian Liszt". His work as a musicologist and teacher brought him to the United States, where he taught at colleges including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago and the New England Conservatory; he also became a United States citizen. In 1966 he retired from academia and returned to his native Switzerland where he spent the remainder of his life.

Saxe-Römhild

Saxe-Römhild (German: "Sachsen-Römhild") was an Ernestine duchy in the southern foothills of the Thuringian Forest. It existed for only 30 years, from 1680 to 1710.
History.
After the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, Ernest the Pious, died on 26 March 1675 in Gotha, the Principality was divided on 24 February 1680 among his seven surviving sons. The lands of Saxe-Römhild went to the fourth son, who became Henry, Duke of Saxe-Römhild (1650–1710). The new Principality included the Districts of Römhild, Königsberg (which was later lost in 1683 to Saxe-Hildburghausen) and Themar, the winery of Behrungen, the monastery estate of Milz, and certain lands of the Echter family of Mespelbrunn that had been lost in 1665 to Saxony. But Duke Henry never had the full sovereignty of his new domains. The actual administration was left to the higher authorities in Gotha – the so-called “"Nexus Gothanus"” – because that was the residence of Henry’s oldest brother, who ruled as Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.
After the death of the childless Henry in 1710, his domains were divided between the four duchies – Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Hildburghausen. Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg took seven-twelfths of the District of Themar. Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld had five-twelfths of the District of Themar and one-third of the District of Römhild. Two-thirds of the District of Römhild went to Saxe-Meiningen. Saxe-Hildburghausen got the rest – the winery of Behrungen, the estate of Milz and the Echter properties.
With the rearrangement of the Ernestine duchess in 1826, all the territories of the former Duchy of Saxe-Römhild were concentrated in only one duchy – Saxe-Melningen.

List of numerical libraries

This is a list of numerical libraries, which are libraries used in software development for performing numerical calculations. It is not a complete list of numerical libraries, but is instead a list of numerical libraries with articles on Wikipedia, with few exceptions.
The Choice of a typical library depends on a diverse range of requirements such as: desired features (for e.g.: large dimensional linear algebra, parallel computation, partial differential equations), commercial/opensource nature, readability of API, portability or platform/compiler dependence (for e.g.: Linux, Windows, Visual C++, GCC), performance in speed, ease-of-use, continued support from developers, standard compliance, specialized optimization in code for specific application scenarios or even the size of the code-base to be installed.
Unfortunately, while there is almost always a choice among a number of libraries, except very few attempts, there doesn't seem to be sufficient comprehensive surveys helping different language users in diverse applications to choose a library. Often it tends to be at the discretion of the user, being chosen according to the awareness among the libraries and one's comfort.

Art Walker

Arthur D. Walker, Jr. (born November 24, 1933) was an American football player. He was an All-American at the University of Michigan in 1954 and played seven seasons of professional football with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League from 1955-1961.
Early years.
Walker, an African-American who grew up four miles east of South Haven, Michigan, attended South Haven High School where he was an All-Big Seven Conference tackle and president of the student council. He was also a catcher on a local baseball team.
University of Michigan.
After graduating from high school in 1951, Walker was awarded an Elmer Gedeon scholarship to the University of Michigan. The Gedeon scholarships, created in memory of a multi-sport student athlete who was killed in World War II, were awarded on the basis of "moral character, good citizenship, scholastic ability, and achievement, promise of leadership and success, and physical ability." Walker played left tackle at Michigan from 1952-1954. As a 192-pound sophomore in 1952, Walker started nine games for the Wolverines and was named an All-Big Ten Conference player. In June 1953, Walker suffered a setback when he pleaded guilty in Ann Arbor Municipal Court to stealing gasoline from a parked car; Walker and another student admitted siphoning gas from a car parked behind a dormitory and paid fines totaling $16.25. As a 200-pound junior in 1953, Walker suffered from injuries. Walker played with a leg injury against Tulane in October 1954, and the Associated Press described Walker as the "sparkplug of the Wolverine line" and reported that, despite the injury, he "made smashing tackles and was a demon getting down under punts." However, his play against Tulane aggravated the injury, resulting in his missing the following game. As a 218-pound senior in 1954, Walker had his best season at Michigan. He played alongside left end Ron Kramer, giving the Wolverines "the strongest defensive left side in the Big Ten." During the 1954 season, Walker played more minutes than any other Michigan player—playing 479 out of 540 minutes in Michigan's nine-game schedule. He was named to the 1954 All-Big Ten teams selected by the Associated Press and the United Press. He was also selected to play in the annual East-West Shrine Game, and selected by the Football Writers Association of America to the "Look magazine" All-American team in 1954. Walker was flown to New York to receive the Look magazine award on The Jackie Gleason Show in December 1954. Walker was the first South Haven athlete ever to receive an All-American rating, and local residents honored him at a testimonial banquet in February 1955. Michigan's line coach Jack Blott spoke at the banquet, and Walker was given a set of luggage.
Professional football in Edmonton.
Walker was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 12th round of the 1955 NFL Draft, but opted instead to play in the Canadian Football League. Walker told a reporter that he went to Canada because they offered more money than the NFL, and he had heard tales of salary troubles of Green Bay players. Walker played seven seasons of professional football as an offensive tackle and defensive guard for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1955-1961. His best season as a professional player was 1957, when he was named Edmonton's Most Valuable Player and was named to the Western Division all-star teams in two polls, one selected by the fans and the other by sportswriters and broadcasters. He also played in the 1957 CFL All-Star Game. After the 1957 season, Walker told a reporter from his home town that he had no regrets about playing in the CFL, despite having to participate in a practice in 17 below zero weather and playing in a game in six below zero weather. In seven seasons with the Eskimos, he became one of the team's most popular players. After a victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1959, a Winnipeg columnist credited Walker with the victory:"There are many reasons why the Bombers failed to make it close, but a major one was a gent by the name of Art Walker. Even a delighted Eagle Keys went on record that he had never seeen Walker play a better game than he did last night. Art handled Ed Kotowich and Fred Cole as if he owned them."Another writer described Walker's performance in the same game as follows:"Thursday night Walker, who seemed bent on some personal vendetta, simply refused to let Winnipeg run anything to the left side of the Edmonton line. Mostly it was sheer ability, but to make his performance even more galling to the Winnipeg offensive unit, every time he guessed right."
Walker's football career came to an end after the 1961 season. He missed most of the 1960 season with a damaged achilles tendon and battled through pain during training camp in 1961. After making it through the first 15 games of the 1961 season without an injury, Walker's achilles tendon injury returned in the third quarter of the season's final game. Following the game, Walker told a reporter that, as he hobbled to the sidelines, he knew his football career were over. He said:"I'd never go through another training camp like I did this year. Anyway what's the point of kidding anyone. I'd never be able to play as well again, even if I tried."
After retiring from football, Walker stated his intent to remain in Edmonton as his permanent home. He noted that he and his wife had good teaching jobs in Edmonton, and "the people in Edmonton have been wonderful to both my family and myself."
According to the book "The Canadian Pro Football Encyclopedia" by Tod Maher and Bob Gill (Maher Sports Media 2011) Walker died on May 26 1973 in Marquette, Michigan at age 39.

On 28 April 2010 he debuted for the Twins at third base. In his first Major League at bat he hit a home run against Detroit Tigers pitcher Max Scherzer. In comparison, hitting a first at bat home run is twice as rare as throwing a no-hitter. Hughes' home run was calculated to have gone 360 feet. He is the 106th person in MLB history to homer in his first major league at-bat dating back to 1855 (less than once per season: .68), and was the 2nd to do so during the 2010 season (the first was Jason Heyward). Four other Twins have homered in their first at-bat: Rick Renick (1968), Dave McKay (1975), Gary Gaetti (1981) and Andre David (1984).
On 22 April 2012 he was claimed off of waivers by the Oakland Athletics to make room on the Twins roster for RHP Jason Marquis. However, 8 days later, Hughes was designated for assignment when Brandon Inge was signed. Hughes was 1–13 in 4 games with Oakland while striking out 6 times. He was released on 17 July.
Toronto Blue Jays signed Hughes on 1 August 2012 and assigned him to their AAA affiliate Las Vegas 51s.
International career.
Hughes played for Australia in the 2005 Baseball World Cup where he batted 1 for 15. Again he played in the 2006 World Baseball Classic going 0 from 3. In 2006 he picked up his form in the Intercontinental Cup, the Australian batted .455 and slugged .755. In 5 games at second and four at third, he was error-free.
Hughes hit .333 for Australia in the 2007 Baseball World Cup. Hughes tied a game against the Dutch national team with a 9th-inning sacrifice fly. Against the Venezuelan national team, Luke cracked a 3-run homer in the bottom of the 11th to win the game. He broke open a tie game against Team Canada in the top of the 9th with a double and the go-ahead run. America's Jayson Nix beat him out for All-Star honours at second base in the tournament.

Club career.
He previously played for Juventude, Ponte Preta, Grêmio and Botafogo in the Campeonato Brasileiro.
On 8 March 2011, Chinese Super League club Guangzhou Evergrande announced that they had signed Renato Cajá on a four-year deal with a fee of US$2.25 million. On 9 April, he made his CSL debut in a 1–1 away draw against Nanchang Hengyuan in the second round of the season. On 17 April, in a league match which Guangzhou Evergrande played against Beijing Guoan at home, he was unhappy for being substituted out by team manager Lee Jang-Soo and returned to dressing room directly. He received a ban of 3 matches and was sent to reserve team by the club. After Cléo suffered a muscular strain in early May, he had a further chance to play for the club. However, Renato Cajá eventually could not adapt himself to the team's strategy. On 2 July, Argentine midfielder Darío Conca joined Guangzhou Evergrande with a domestic record fee of $10 million. Renato Cajá was ruled out in the squad due to the foreign players restricted. He was loaned back to Ponte Preta on 15 July for one year with a fee of 600,000 USD.
In June 2012, Renato Cajá was loaned to J. League Division 1 side Kashima Antlers for 6 months. Kashima Antlers also had an option to make the move permanent in the end of the 2012 league season with a fee of US$2 million. Renato Cajá made his debut in the first leg of 2012 J. League Cup quarter-finals which Kashima Antlers played against Cerezo Osaka on 25 July, coming on as a substitute for Dutra in the second half. His first J League debut came on 3 days later, in a 2–2 home draw against Sanfrecce Hiroshima. On 1 August, Renato Cajá scored his first goal for Kashima in the 2012 Suruga Bank Championship. He kept his good performance and scored his first league goal from a direct free kick on 11 August, which ensured Kashima beat Júbilo Iwata 2–1. Renato Cajá scored 3 goals in 20 appearances for Kashima before he was loaned return to Guangzhou Evergrande on 30 December.
Renato Cajá moved to Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Vitória on loan on 15 January 2013. On 13 January 2014, he was loaned to Süper Lig side Bursaspor until the end of 2013-2014 league season.

Julie Seitter

Julie Seitter (née Julie Stinneford) is a professional voice talent who can be heard as "Julie", the interactive voice response agent for Amtrak's automated information and reservation telephone system. Julie's positive voice personality—described as "spunky", "tirelessly chipper", "perky", "unshakably courteous", and "reassuring"—has been cited as one of the reasons for the success of the Amtrak system. Upon the automated system's confirmation of a caller's spoken instruction, Seitter's recorded voice would cheerily intone, "Great!" or "Got it!", while a speech recognition failure might prompt the message, "I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you..."
On Valentine's Day in 2002, Seitter's voice was featured, in character, in a humorous National Public Radio story, and Seitter's Amtrak persona was parodied in a recurring "Saturday Night Live" sketch in 2005–2006, with Rachel Dratch as "Julie". Seitter made a one-time appearance on "Jeopardy!" as a contestant on February 28, 2006. 45 years old , Seitter resides in Littleton, Massachusetts with her husband and two sons.
Amtrak agent.
The speech recognition-based Amtrak system using recordings of Julie's voice as an automated reservation agent premiered in April 2001, and soon garnered a caller approval rating of over 90% while saving the railway system an estimated more than $13 million. Seitter recorded herself for the "Julie" system (which the rail network named for her) working out of a basement studio in her Massachusetts home. She later moved, and now works out of a room in the attic of a new house.

St. Teresa Roman Catholic Church, New Toronto

St. Teresa Roman Catholic Church is in the former town of New Toronto in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario and a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto. It serves the local Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School.
History.
St. Teresa Church was formed out of St. Leo's, Mimico 1924 to serve the Town of New Toronto. The congregation worshipped in the Century Hall (on Sixth Street) until the old church on Tenth Street was finished the next year, 1925. The first pastor, Fr. Clancy who chose the dedication for the parish (St. Theresa), was succeeded by Fr. Carroll as the Second World War began in 1939, bringing in a period of many changes for the parish. Christ the King Roman Catholic Church, Long Branch was formed out of St. Theresa's in 1939 to serve the growing village (former sea side resort) to the west. With the end of the war, many Polish families began to move into the area from war-torn Europe, taking work at local industries; this led to the 1957 founding of St. Teresa Catholic Elementary School beside the church. After liturgical changes in the Latin Rite, a new, modernist style church was built on Eleventh Street in 1967; the old church was demolished. The local Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School, which serves all the southern Etobicoke parishes, recently moved from the Alderwood area into the nearby former Mimico Asylum grounds which is in St Teresa's Parish.

Elisse B. Walter

Elisse B. Walter (born April 14, 1950 in New York City) was the 30th Chairperson of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from December 14, 2012-April 10, 2013. She was appointed Chairwoman by President Barack Obama on November 26, 2012, and sworn in on December 14, 2012. She was originally appointed as one of five SEC Commissioners by President George W. Bush and sworn in on July 9, 2008. Under designation by President Obama, she later served as Acting Chairwoman during January 2009. 
On January 24, 2013, President Obama nominated Mary Jo White to be Walter's successor as Chairwoman. White was confirmed by the Senate on April 8, 2013, and was sworn into office on April 10, 2013.
Education.
Walter attended Pembroke College at Brown University in 1967 and graduated from Yale University with a B.A., "cum laude", in applied mathematics. She received her J.D. degree, "cum laude", from Harvard Law School. She graduated from Herricks High School in New Hyde Park, Long Island, NY.
Career.
Walter holds a Democratic seat on the Commission, succeeding Annette Nazareth, who left the SEC in January 2008 to work in private practice. Walter was recommended for the Commissioner position by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) in 2007, along with fellow Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar. Her term on the Commission ended June 5, 2012 but she can continue to serve until the end of 2013.
Prior to her appointment as an SEC Commissioner, she served as Senior Executive Vice President, Regulatory Policy & Programs, for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). She held the same position at the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) before its 2007 consolidation with NYSE Member Regulation and redesignation as FINRA. Walter coordinated policy issues across FINRA and oversaw a number of departments including Investment Company Regulation, Member Education and Training, Investor Education, and Emerging Regulatory Issues. She also served on the Board of Directors of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. 
Prior to joining the NASD, she served as General Counsel of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Before joining the CFTC in 1994, she was the Deputy Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC. She served on the SEC's staff beginning in 1977, both in that Division and in the Office of the General Counsel. Before joining the SEC, she was an attorney with a private law firm.
Walter served on the Board of Trustees of Jewish Women International and the SEC Historical Society and is a member of the Academy of Women Achievers of the YWCA of the City of New York, according to her official biographies.
SEC chair.
Walter became Chairwoman when her predecessor, Mary Schapiro, stepped down on December 14, 2012. Walter was serving a five-year term that ended in June 2012, but Commissioners can serve an additional 18 months after their terms end, according to a "MarketWatch" report at the time her appointment was announced. Even at that time, President Obama was likely to nominate someone for a full term soon thereafter, the report said. Walter "told agency officials that she plans to serve for a short time. The White House, which faces more pressing cabinet-level nominations, is expected to name an S.E.C. successor next year," the NY "Times" reported then.
Issues.
Ms. Walter has led the SEC's in-depth review of the municipal securities markets.
In August 2008 at an opening meeting of the SEC, Walter expressed her support for the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards for U.S. companies, but cautioned that a ruling from the SEC was far from finalized. "Most important, we have to keep in mind that no one knows for certain what the future will hold," she said. "I strongly believe that we have to prepare for the alternative that the Commission will determine not to adopt, or permit the use of, IFRS for U.S. issuers. . . . are significant hurdles to overcome over the next three years in order for the Commission to determine to accept IFRS reporting from U.S. issuers."
Another issue she addressed, while at the National Association of Securities Dealers, was the NASD's regulatory activities regarding inappropriate sales of certain investment products to members of the armed forces. Testifying before a congressional subcommittee in May 2006 concerning the NASD's financial education programs focused on military service members and their families, she addressed issues raised by a particular broker-dealer, First Command Financial Planning, Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, which had been making inappropriate sales of products and services, including the sale of an investment product called Periodic Payment Plans or PPPs. First Command had targeted and sold more than a half million complicated and often extremely expensive PPPs to servicepersons. After investigation and censure, the firm was fined $12 million in December 2004. That amount included restitution, and funding for the NASD Investor Education Foundation. As of 2006, First Command informed the NASD that it has ceased selling PPPs.
Personal.
Walter is married to Ronald Alan Stern, the chief antitrust attorney for General Electric. They have two sons.

Women's 200 metres world record progression

The first World Record in the 200 m for women (athletics) was recognised by the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale (FSFI) in 1922. The FSFI was absorbed by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1936. However, the IAAF did not maintain a record category for 200 m (bend) as opposed to 200 m (straight) until after 1951. The IAAF eliminated the 200 m (straight) record after 1976. "y" denotes times set at 220 yards (201.17 m) which were ratified as world records.
To June 21, 2009, the IAAF (and the FSFI before it) have ratified 26 world records in the event.
Records 1922–36; 1951–76.
(+) denotes en route time set during longer race
Records from 1977.
From 1975, the IAAF accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting January 1, 1977, the IAAF required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these events.
Irena Szewińska's 22.21 from 1974 was the fastest eligible 200 metre performance at that time.

International Classification of Headache Disorders

The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is a detailed hierarchical classification of all headache-related disorders published by the International Headache Society. It is considered the official classification of headaches by the World Health Organization, and, in 1992, was incorporated into the 10th edition of their "International Classification of Diseases" (ICD-10). Each class of headache contains explicit diagnostic criteria—meaning that the criteria includes quantities rather than vague terms like "several" or "usually"—that are based on clinical and laboratory observations.
The ICHD was first published in 1988 (now known as the ICHD-1). The second and current version, the ICHD-2, was published in 2004.

Operation RY

Operation RY (Invasion of Nauru & Ocean Island) was the name of the Imperial Japanese plan to invade and occupy Nauru and Ocean islands in the south Pacific during the Pacific conflict of World War II. The operation was originally set to be executed in May 1942 immediately following Operation MO and before Operation MI, which resulted in the Battle of Midway. The primary reason for the operation was to exploit the islands' supplies of phosphate. After a postponement due to interference by enemy forces, the operation was completed in August 1942.
Background.
Before and during World War II, Nauru and Ocean Island were isolated but rich with phosphate deposits. The islands were under Australian mandate control with the British Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) running the phosphate mining. The phosphate deposits were mined for making ammunition, explosives and fertilizers.
The German auxiliary cruisers and sank five merchant ships and bombarded the island causing damage to the phosphate mining, disrupting the allies production of phosphate. Following the raids the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty agree to redeploy Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders. The armed merchant cruiser arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941, and Australian and New Zealand warships maintained a continual presence off the islands during the subsequent months and a naval company and two field guns were deployed to each island. The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand.
In late February 1942, as a Japanese invasion of Nauru and Ocean Island was feared, the Free French destroyer departed the New Hebrides to evacuate both Nauru and Ocean Island. The ship arrived on 23 February and completed the evacuation without serious incident.
Although Operation MO was cancelled on 8 May 1942 immediately following the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy forces departed Rabaul and Bougainville on 11 May to execute the "RY" operation.
First invasion attempt.
On 11 May 1942, the Imperial Japanese invasion force, under the command of Rear Admiral Shima Kiyohide departed Rabaul consisting of the cruiser , the minelayers (flagship) and and destroyers and , covered by 5th Cruiser Division, under the command of Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi, consisting of the heavy cruisers and with the Destroyer Division 30 destroyers , , and . The invasion troops from the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) and Kashima SNLF were carried by the transports "Kinryū Maru" and "Takahata Maru".
While steaming through driving rain off New Ireland and west of Buka Island, "Okinoshima", which had been damaged by planes from "Yorktown" during the invasion of Tulagi on 4 May 1942, was torpedoed at 04:52 by the United States Navy submarine (Commander Oliver G. Kirk) and severely damaged. The invasion force's escorts closed "S-42" and depth charged the area until 1130, causing damage. The submarine left the area to return to base at Moreton Bay, Brisbane. Rear Admiral Shima transferred his flag to "Yūzuki" southwest of Buka Island, Bougainville. At 06:40, "Okinoshima" capsized under tow by "Mochizuki" in St. George's Channel at .
While returning to Rabaul after being dispatched to assist repair work on "Okinoshima", the repair ship was torpedoed off Cape St George, New Ireland, by . She sank at 1440 at .
In spite of the loss of "Okinoshima", the rest of the Japanese forces continued with the operation. As these forces were "en route", however, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft from Tulagi sighted the United States Navy aircraft carriers and heading towards Nauru. The two US carriers, acting on intelligence taken from intercepted Japanese communications, had been sent to the area as a feint to try to stop the Japanese operation.
The feint was successful. Fearing the threat posed by the US carriers to the "RY" forces, which did not have air cover, the Japanese cancelled the operation on 15 May and the naval forces returned to Rabaul.
Second Invasion Attempt.
A second invasion force departed Truk on 26 August 1942, consisting of the cruiser , the destroyers , "Yūzuki", "Ariake", and , and the transport "Hakozaki Maru".
The landing forces landed on Nauru on 29 August and Ocean Island on 30 August unopposed.
Base Development.
Japanese forces occupied the two islands until the end of the war, but became increasingly isolated as the war progressed.
Allied Attacks.
During the Japanese occupation of Nauru, American aircraft repeatedly bombed the island's facilities.

Fiberize

Fiberization is a manufacturing process that has been used to make objects such as insulation, asphalt, and mineral wood. Optical fiber wiring is created using this method as well.
Definition.
The term "fiberization" is used to describe several similar processes. In general, molten plastic or other fiberizable materials are extruded to form a fibrous mass, which is then post-processed through varying methods.
Rotary Fiberization.
Possibly the most common form of fiberization, rotary fiberization utilizes centrifugal force to form fibers. A hollowed wheel with many small holes is injected with whatever molten material is being fiberized. The wheel must by necessity include vents for the hot gases as well. One design for rotary fiberization places slits in a central bore-axle that lets the hot gases escape As the centrifugal force squeezes the molten material out of the holes, it is severed from the wheel by a sharp blade. As the fibers are collected, several post-processes can be applied, such as grouping or bunching.
New research.
New research makes possible the fiberization of silicate melts in an acoustic field. These silicate metals become super-fine in such conditions, and have great potential in the microelectronic field.

Ponikve, Tolmin

Ponikve () is a clustered settlement in the Municipality of Tolmin in the Littoral region of Slovenia.
Geography.
Ponikve is located on the western part of the Šentviška Gora Plateau () above the Bača Gorge (). It lies on the road from Idrija pri Bači to Pečine to Slap ob Idrijci in a basin surrounded by the following hills: Oblačno Brdo, Pušnik, Zadnik, Gasilca, Križ, and Lepa Gorica. It includes the hamlets of Lazi, Ostrožnik, Pri Puhu, Rob, Rute, V Grapi, Zagomilca, Zapušnik, and Za Vrhom. Intermittent Lake Rupa (surface area 0.12 ha, max. depth 2 m) lies north of the village. The lake is the source of an intermittent influent stream that disappears into a gorge at the end of the village, probably reemerging at Kresnica Cave above the hamlet of Potoka near Slap ob Idrijci.
Name.
The name Ponikve is a plural form derived from the word "ponikva" 'influent stream' or 'sinkhole' (into which such a stream disappears). In its plural form it refers to a gently rolling landscape consisting of the basins of an influent stream. Like other villages named Ponikve and similar names (e.g., "Ponikva"), it refers to a local landscape element.
History.
The village of Ponikve was burned on 26 July 1907 in a fire caused by a lightning strike. A fire department was established in Ponikve in 1947, and a station was built for it in 1957. In 1974 the department was expanded to serve the entire Šentviška Gora Plateau. A new fire station was built in 1980, following the earthquake of 1976.
Architecture.
The typical houses are two-story steep-roofed buildings of the Cerkno type, some of which were still had thatched roofs in second half of the 20th century, with farm buildings standing behind them. The hayracks are the double type, known as the "toplar".
Visitation Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Visitation and belongs to the Koper Diocese. Three churches are known to have stood at this site. The original small Gothic church at this site is believed to date from the 1480s based on a stone plaque on the south side of the church bearing the inscription "maister Andre von Lach 148_" (the last digit is missing), referring to the prominent builder Andrej of Loka (a.k.a. Andreas von Lack).
In the 18th century, a new larger Baroque church was built at the site. At that time the altar and other church valuables were brought to this church from the already abandoned and dilapidated former St. Nicholas' Church, which stood on the hill north of the village. On 2 July 1944, on the Feast of the Annunciation, the church was burned by German troops, destroying everything except the altar statue and the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre, which the locals managed to save. The ruins were dynamited in March 1945, leaving only the damaged bell tower and walls.
In 1952, after considerable difficulty and thanks to the efforts of the parish priest Janez Lapanja, the architect Jože Plečnik agreed to rebuild the church. Work began in 1954, and this third structure was newly consecrated on 19 October 1958 by Archbishop Anton Vovk. In Plečnik's characteristic style, the reconstruction utilized elements of the old structure, including the bell tower. At the same time, the interior and exterior decoration departed radically from the former building, and the orientation of the church was reversed so that the nave is now on the east end, towards the village, and the altar on the west. The church has two bell towers: the old one and a new one on the east side that also contains the stairs to the choir loft. The altar is in the corner to the right and above it is a 2 meter sculpture of the Virgin Mary with the Infant Christ. It was carved from linden wood by the sculptor Jože Lapuh of Ljubljana. The altar, paving, and columns are the work of Stane Vodnik from Podutik near Ljubljana. The church also contains a chalice made of brass and tombac donated by Plečnik, and a silver chalice donated by Vovk.
A second church in the parish is dedicated to Saint Anne. This chapel was built in 1862 and was used for masses on weekdays and in the winter, when it was difficult to reach the parish church. It also served as a school in the 19th century, where the parish priest also served as a teacher. It was partially renovated between 1951 and 1953 and a sacristy was added to the structure.
Other cultural heritage.
In addition to Visitation Church, several other structures in Ponikve have protected cultural monument status:

Adcock antenna

The Adcock antenna is an antenna (British English aerial) array consisting of four equidistant vertical elements which can be used to transmit or receive directional radio waves.
The Adcock array was invented and patented by British engineer Frank Adcock in 1919 as British Patent No. 130,490, and has been used for a variety of applications, both civilian and military, ever since. Although originally conceived for receiving Low Frequency (LF) waves, it has also been used for transmitting, and has since been adapted for use at much higher frequencies, up to Ultra High Frequency (UHF).
In the early 1930s, the Adcock antenna (transmitting in the LF/MF bands) became a key feature of the newly created radio navigation system for aviation. The Low Frequency radio range (LFR) network, which consisted of hundreds of Adcock antenna arrays, defined the airways used by aircraft for instrument flying. The LFR remained as the main aerial navigation technology until it was replaced by the VOR system in the 1950s and 1960s.
The Adcock antenna array has been widely used commercially, and implemented in vertical antenna heights ranging from over 130 feet (40 meters) in the LFR network, to as small as 5 inches (13 cm) in tactical direction finding applications (receiving in the UHF band).
Radio direction finding.
Frank Adcock originally used the antenna as a receiving antenna, to find the azmuthal direction a radio signal was coming from in order to find the location of the radio transmitter; a process called radio direction finding.
Prior to Adcock's invention, engineers had been using loop antennas to achieve directional sensitivity. They discovered that due to atmospheric disturbances and reflections, the detected signals included significant components of electromagnetic interference and distortions: horizontally polarized radiation contaminating the signal of interest and reducing the accuracy of the measurement.
Adcock—who was serving as an Army officer in the British Expeditionary Force in wartime France at the time he filed his invention—solved this problem by replacing the loop antennas with symmetrically inter-connected pairs of vertical monopole or dipole antennas of equal length. This created the equivalent of square loops, but without their horizontal members, thus eliminating sensitivity to much of the horizontally polarized distortion. The same principles remain valid today, and the Adcock antenna array and its variants are still used for radio direction finding.
Low Frequency radio range.
In the late 1920s, the Adcock antenna was adopted for aerial navigation, in what became known as the Low Frequency radio range (LFR), or the "Adcock radio range". Hundreds of transmitting stations, each consisting of four or five Adcock antenna towers, were constructed around the U.S. and elsewhere.
The result was a network of electronic airways, which allowed pilots to navigate at night and in poor visibility, under virtually all weather conditions. The LFR remained as the main aerial navigation system in the U.S. and other countries until the 1950s, when it was replaced by VHF-based VOR technology. By the 1980s all LFR stations were decommissioned.

1974 VFL Grand Final

The 1974 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Richmond Football Club and North Melbourne Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 28 September 1974. It was the 78th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1974 VFL season. The match, attended 113,839 spectators, was won by Richmond by a margin of 41 points, marking that club's ninth premiership victory. The game itself is also notable for being the first grand final broadcast in colour.
Background.
Richmond, the reigning premiers, were making their third consecutive appearance in a Grand Final. Conversely, this was only North Melbourne's second appearance in a Grand Final in their long history, their sole previous appearance having been in the 1950 VFL Grand Final. They were yet to win a flag. 
The Kangaroos were coached by three-time Premiership coach Ron Barassi, who in his second year as coach of the Kangaroos had managed to reverse the club's fortunes after it had finished as the bottom side in the 1972 season. The addition through the 10-year rule of experienced players from other clubs such as Doug Wade (Geelong), Barry Davis (Essendon) and John Rantall (South Melbourne) added great strength to the North Melbourne side.
At the conclusion of the regular home-and-away season, Richmond had finished first on the ladder with 17 wins and 5 losses. North Melbourne had finished second with 16 wins and 6 losses.
In the finals series leading up to the Grand Final, North Melbourne defeated Hawthorn by 38 points in the Qualifying Final before losing to Richmond by 21 points in the Second Semi-Final. They then met Hawthorn again in the Preliminary Final, which they won by just four points to advance to the Grand Final. Richmond advanced straight to the Grand Final on the back of their win in the Second Semi-Final.
In the week leading up to the Grand Final, North Melbourne wingman Keith Greig won his second consecutive Brownlow Medal.
Match summary.
First quarter.
The match was played on a dry surface in overcast conditions. The game developed into a battle of defences in the early part of the opening quarter, before North’s Sam Kekovich marked strongly and kicked the first goal of the game. North had the majority of the crowd support due to the fact it was striving for its first VFL premiership. Wayne Walsh kicked Richmond’s first goal after receiving a free kick in the forward pocket. Inspirational Tigers captain Royce Hart was right on top at centre half-forward, marking strongly on several occasions. Daryl Cumming handpassed to tall youngster David Cloke and he registered the Tigers’ second goal with an excellent left-foot snap under extreme pressure from several North defenders. Both sides were applying intense physical pressure, and this resulted in several basic errors in general play. Misses to Hart, Kevin Bartlett and Paul Sproule saw Richmond move to 2 goals 7 behinds (19 points), before Barry Richardson goaled after a strong mark to give the Tigers a comfortable lead near quarter-time. The Kangaroos, however, fought back with a fine snap from full-forward Doug Wade, which chalked up his 100th goal for the season. Veteran rover Barry Cable kicked a goal right on the siren after receiving a free kick, to bring North to within ten points.
Second quarter.
After their late rush in the first quarter, the Kangaroos started strongly in the second term. Early goals to captain Barry Davis and two from Wade saw them open up a 12-point lead. Then, a major turning point in the game occurred when Kevin Sheedy took a clever one-handed mark in the forward pocket for the Tigers. He went back to take his shot for goal from a very acute angle, ran in as if to kick, but then handballed over the man on the mark (North’s) Brad Smith to the unguarded Michael Green, who dribbled through the easiest of goals. North seemed to falter after this as Richmond lifted dramatically. Shortly after, Sheedy passed to an unchecked Hart, who marked and goaled from the forward pocket. The Tigers’ charge continued as Green took a strong mark and converted from the goal square. Then North's Keith Greig won the ball in fine style on the Members’ wing, dodged two Tiger opponents, took a bounce and passed to Wayne Schimmelbusch, who dished off to Cable. But Cable, who was on his own, somehow fumbled the mark and the ball rolled through for a behind. Richmond then went forward, where Neil Balme was given a free kick for a trip. He subsequently sent a towering torpedo punt right through the middle from the outer half-forward flank. Hart continued to dominate, kicking two goals – one from a top mark, where he threw himself sideways, and the other from a snap after gathering a loose ball from a ball-up. Robert Peterson replied with a good snap-shot goal for North, to reduce Richmond’s lead to 20 points at the long break.
Third quarter.
North Melbourne appeared after half-time without its skipper Davis, who had an injured leg. After just two minutes of play, Sheedy goaled for the Tigers after taking a mark. Then David Thorpe’s shot for goal narrowly missed, before Wade got one back for North. Richmond, however, quickly replied when Thorpe converted from a free kick. The standard of play was excellent, as the Kangaroos’ 19th man Arnold Briedis goaled with a fine kick on the run. Richmond’s teamwork was the major difference between the sides. Kevin Morris was felled on the outer wing and shortly afterwards a fight broke out involving a large group of players. Wade charged from full-forward at Tiger defender Robert McGhie, but McGhie ducked and Wade was sent sprawling to the turf. Bryan Wood and Paul Feltham tangled, along with Morris and Kekovich. The Tigers added points to Sheedy, from a free kick, Sproule, from a mark, and Cumming, from a snap. With McGhie limping noticeably, Kekovich slammed through his second goal. North threw everything at Richmond, but the Tigers’ defence stood firm. Morris missed after a kick on the run. From the kick-in, however, Sheedy took a superb high mark and goaled from the outer pocket. Following a high-standard third quarter, the Kangaroos had reduced Richmond’s half-time lead by only one point.
Fourth quarter.
From the first bounce, Hart drove the Tigers forward, where Cumming grabbed the loose ball and handballed to Richardson, who was alone in the goal square. The subsequent goal came after only 51 seconds of play in the term. Not long after, strong play by Thorpe led to the ball being forced towards Cumming, who tapped it to Sheedy for another goal. Richmond’s surge continued when Hart grabbed a loose ball on the centre wing and passed to Sheedy, who drove deep into the forward pocket with a drop kick. Richardson then gathered the crumbs and cleverly eluded an opponent, before snapping a terrific right-foot goal. Hart was flattened in an incident with North’s Phil Baker, who had his number taken as a result. Cumming increased the Tigers’ lead to 44 points when he goaled from a free kick. Richardson booted the next goal after taking a fine mark diving sideways. Greig replied for the Kangaroos with a good running goal. Richardson, using his body well to keep his opponent out, took another strong mark, and goaled. Cameron Clayton came on to the field to replace Wood, with Sheedy going off to allow Brian Roberts a run. Burns kicked North’s 13th goal, but it was all to no avail for the Kangaroos. Richmond finished the match full of running and scored a convincing 41-point victory.
Epilogue.
This was Richmond's fourth VFL Premiership in eight years, all of them under the coaching of Tom Hafey. It was also the second time that the team had won back-to-back VFL flags. While this victory signaled the end of a very successful era for Richmond, for North Melbourne it was just the beginning. They would participate in the next four Grand Finals, eventually breaking through to win their first VFL Premiership in 1975. It would be another six years before Richmond appeared in another Premiership decider, when it contested the 1980 VFL Grand Final.

Awkuzu

Awkuzu is a town in Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra state of Nigeria. 
Origin.
The story of Origin of Awkuzu is not quite clear. A school of thought believes Awkuzu was one of the progenies of the fifth child of Eri (Eru / Nri) his only daughter called Iguedo, who is also said to have born the founders of Ogbunike, Nteje, Umuleri and Nando. But this assumption have been criticized lately as 'fallacy' on the ground that Eri was also the father of the founder of Umuleri. Those on this side of argument believed that Iguedo is from the lineage of the Ogiso (Bini) and was a famous and most popular wife of Eri. She initially married Nnamenyi to whom she bore Ogbunike and Awkuzu prior to her marriage to Eri whom she begot Umueri. At the death of Eri, She married Iru and bore Nando. 
Awkuzu which is the colonial corruption of the name, "OKUZU" is presently located in Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State and is bounded by Umunya and Nteje towns also in Oyi LGA, IfiteDunu, Ukpo and Ukwulu in Dunukofia LGA and Nando and Igbariam towns in today's Anambra East LGA, and Abba in Njikoka LGA. 
Divisions.
Awkuzu is divided into three main parts: Ezi, Ifite and Ikenga sections according to seniority or birth order. Like most Eri-Awka towns of Igboland, each section is further divided into sub-villages. 
As a community, Awkuzu is famed for its large population which gave it the sobriquet as "Ibilibe Ogada" (the locust swarming fame), a title that steamed from 'glorified' local disputes with neighbors but now attached to the traditional stool.
Traditional Leadership.
The origin of common leadership in Awkuzu predates the colonialists' entry into the Niger Delta and Igbo heartland in the 1800s. First, the people have had recognized primateship religious priesthood authority which was exercised by the Eze Ana who holds the Ofo-Awkuzu. Until about the 1700, when one of her powerful men, Mgbako was initiated into the Ozo-Atulu-Ukpa-Okala by his Umunya warrior friend, Igboegbunam Odezuluigbo (who himself received the title at Nri Anaocha), the priest of Ana provided political adjudicature as well as religious headship. 
The title the traditional prime minister of Awkuzu is called "Nnamenyi" which was given to Late Chief Anaegboka Odife in the 1970s. He was succeeded by Chief Ogamba and later by the Late Obi John Ejikeme Nebeolisa. 
The title of the traditional ruler of Awkuzu is called "EZE AWKUZU". this title is reserved for the heirs to the Ibilibe Ogada throne; the Aganama royal family of Awkuzu. The Nnamenyi title is only a chieftaincy title created by the Anambra state government for political and administrative purposes for communities in the state who did not have Royal Thrones. This goes to explain that the traditional rulership of Awkuzu 'EZE AWKUZU' is hereditary while the Nnamenyi, Igwe, Obi and other like titles can be given to anybody. 
Obi John Ejikeme Nnebolisa never was enthroned on the Nnamenyi Chieftaincy line as that title was fraudlently brought into Awkuzu by mischief makers for which they paid dearly for that sacrilege. Obi John Ejikeme Nnebolisa was rightfully and traditionally enthroned as "OBI NA EJELU EZE OZI" by the EZE of Awkuzu EZE AGANAMA who died only recently. Making the throne vacant as I write.

German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement

The German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement, signed on January 10, 1941, was a broad agreement settling border disputes and continuing raw materials and war machine trade between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The agreement continued the countries' relationship that started in 1939 with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact containing secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany, and the subsequent invasions by Germany and the Soviet Union of that territory. The "German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement" contained additional secret protocols settling a dispute regarding land in Lithuania previously split between the countries. The agreement continued Nazi-Soviet economic relations that had been expanded by the 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement and the larger 1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement.
The agreement proved to be short lived. Just six months after it was signed, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and economic relations between the two countries came to an end. The raw materials imported by Germany from the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1941 played a major role in supporting the German war effort against the Soviet Union after 1941.
Background.
Resource requirements.
Germany lacked natural supplies of several key raw materials needed for economic and military operations. German planners in mid-1939 determined that the nation possessed only two to three months' supply of rubber stocks and three to six months of oil stocks. They estimated that, after a planned German attack on Poland and the expected subsequent allied naval blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only potential supplier for many key raw materials needed for a war.
Soviet-German 1939 agreements and the division of Eastern Europe.
On August 19, 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany entered German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939) providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials. On August 23, they entered the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which contained secret protocols dividing the states of Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet "spheres of influence."
One week after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's signing, the partition of Poland commenced with the German invasion of western Poland, followed by the Soviet Union's invasion of Eastern Poland on September 17, which included coordination with German forces. Three Baltic States described by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were given no choice but to sign a ""Pact of defense and mutual assistance"" which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.
Eleven days after the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland, the parties modified the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in an agreement called the "German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty" that contained a "Secret Additional Protocol." Among other things, the agreement allotted Germany a larger part of Poland and transferred Lithuania to the Soviets. However, one piece of Lithuania referred to as the "Lithuania Strip", the left bank of river Scheschupe, was to remain a German territory.
1940 German–Soviet Economic Relationship.
Hitler's press for a German invasion of Poland in 1939 placed tremendous strain on the German military, which was not scheduled to be ready for total war until 1942 or 1943. In addition, Germany faced critical shortages in oil, rubber and other materials needed to prosecute even just a western offensive. The only remaining state capable of supplying Germany with the requisite raw materials was the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviets' demands for manufactured goods, such as German machines, were increasing while its ability to import those goods from outside decreased when many countries ceased trading relations after the Soviet entry into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. On February 11, 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union entered into the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, an intricate trade pact in which the Soviet Union would send Germany 650 million Reichmarks in raw materials in exchange for 650 million Reichmarks in machinery, manufactured goods and technology. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount the British blockade of Germany. The Soviet Union became a major supplier of vital materials to Germany, including oil, copper, nickel, chrome, platinum, lumber and grain.
The Baltics and Bessarabia.
In mid-June 1940, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, resulting in those states' annexation into the Soviet Union, including the whole of Lithuania, including the Scheschupe area, which was to be given to Germany. On June 26, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum demanding Bessarabia, Bukovina, and the Hertza region from Romania. After the Soviets agreed with Germany that they would limit their claims in Bukovina to northern Bukovina, Germany urged Romania to accept the ultimatum. With France no longer in a position to be the guarantor of the status quo in Eastern Europe, and the Third Reich pushing Romania to make concessions to the Soviet Union, the Romanian government gave in, following Italy's counsel and Vichy France's recent example. After the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, around 100,000 Volksdeutsche living in Bessarabia began immigrating to Germany.
That summer, Germany grew even more dependent on Soviet imports. German acquisitions of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium created additional demand while decreasing avenues for indirect supply.
Last Soviet attempts to join the Axis.
Hitler had been considering war with the Soviet Union since July 1940. However, after Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, in October 1940, the Soviet Union explored a possible entry into the Axis themselves. After long discussions and proposals, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). Eleven days later, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counterproposal where they would accept the four power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence focus on the area around modern Iraq and Iran. The Soviet offer came concurrently with massive economic efforts to Germany. The Soviets promised by May 11, 1941 the delivery of 2.5 million tons of grain—1 million tons above its current obligations. They also promised full compensation for the Volksdeutsche property claims.
Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union. Stalin's written draft counter-proposal was ignored, which worsened tensions between the countries.
Negotiations.
In October 1940, German officials estimated that their raw material supplies could comfortably last only though the summer of 1941. The situation was much more dire for rubber, the use for which in boots and tires was vital for any mobile army. German stocks had fallen to only 1,500 tons. The secret protocols had also caused Hitler to be in the humiliating position of having to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, the Volksdeutsche, who had lived in Finland and the Baltic countries for centuries, while officially condoning the invasions. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them Bukovina. Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety, guarantees for 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.
While Hitler planned for war in the east, he wanted an additional economic deal to get what he could from the Soviet Union before the invasion, while other German officials wanted such a deal in the hopes that it could change the current anti-Soviet direction of German policy. Meanwhile, because of delivery difficulties and other issues, doubts began to arise about whether the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement would continue to be effective.
Furthermore, talks became heated around the issue of the "Lithuanian Strip". When the Soviets occupied the whole of Lithuania on June 15, this included the Strip, which had been promised to Germany in the "Secret Additional Protocols" German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty modifying the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Negotiations began in Moscow on October 30. German military economic negotiators had hoped for success in the negotiations, in part, because they felt this would strengthen their arguments against Hitler's then increasingly anti-Soviet policy. The parties came closer to agreements on German 38-cm turrets, but the Soviets continued to resist demands for a full reimbursement of Volksdeutsche property. Instead of permitting full indemnification, the Soviets put restrictions on the wealth that the Volksdeutsche could take with them and limited the totals that the Soviets would apply to the Reich's clearing accounts. In November, negotiations proceeded well for Germany on potential modifications for year two of the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, with the Soviets first increasing their grain offer from 1.2 million tons to 1.5 million, and then up to Germany's demand for 2.5 million tons. Negotiations regarding the "Lithuanian Strip" required Hitler's direct intervention, so negotiations were briefly suspended on November 29 awaiting his actions.
The parties further negotiated over the percentage of nickel each would receive from a Finnish nickel mine at Petsamo and the amount that the Soviets would compensate Germany for their property claims in the Baltics, now occupied by the Soviet Union. Progress was made on the Volksdeutsche property front, with total compensation between 200 million and 350 million Reichsmarks, while the Soviets requested 50 million Reichsmarks for their property claims in German-occupied territories. They reached general agreement on German shipments of 10.5-cm flak cannons, gold, machinery and other items.
Hitler desired an arrangement because German planners were estimating that German food, oils and nonferrous metals would run out in 1941, and German rubber supplies could run out almost immediately, especially if Trans-Siberian or blockade-breaker shipments failed to arrive. German allies, such as Italy, were in even worse shape for key raw materials.
Knowing they were preparing for an invasion of the Soviet Union, German negotiators pushed to delay the delivery of German goods beyond the summer of 1941. Suspicious of German delays, in December, the Soviets demanded that all questions pending between the countries be resolved before an agreement could be made. Tensions had already built after Germany had ignored Stalin's letter regarding Axis membership, with negotiators almost coming to blows at one point.
The Agreement.
On January 10, 1941, the German ambassador to Moscow von Schulenburg and Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov signed agreements in Moscow to settle all of the open disputes that the Soviets had demanded.
The agreement included relatively few substantially new economic elements. It extended trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942 and increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement to 620 to 640 million Reichmarks. The agreement also finalized issues over transit costs for shipped goods, settled issues over the delivery schedules for goods shipped in year two of the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia and calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic States now occupied by the Soviets.
Because of a stronger German negotiation position, German Foreign Ministry official Karl Schnurre concluded that, in economic terms, the agreement was "the greatest Germany ever concluded, going well beyond the previous year's February agreement." The agreement included Soviet commitments to 2.5 million tons of grain shipments and 1 million tons of oil shipments, as well as large amounts of nonferrous and precious metals. German Special Ambassador Karl Ritter, in a state of near-euphoria over Germany's achievement, wrote a directive to all German embassies that "While Britain and the United States have up to now been unsuccessful in their efforts to come to an agreement with the Soviet Union in any field, the Soviet Union has concluded with Germany, the largest contract ever between two states."
The agreement further covered the migration to Germany within two and a half months of Volksdeutsche, ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic and Balkan territories, and the migration to the Soviet Union of ethnic Russians, Baltic and "White Russian" "nationals" in German-held territories. In many cases, the resulting population transfers of Volksdeutsche were to land previously held by ethnic Poles or others in Nazi-occupied territories.
The agreement also formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka river and the Baltic Sea.
Secret protocols in the new agreement stated that Germany would renounce its claims to the Lithuanian Strip in the "Secret Additional Protocols" of the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty and that the territory would be regarded as within the Soviet sphere of influence, for which Germany would be paid 7.5 million dollars (31.5 million Reichsmark). Because of currency fluctuation issues, the parties used American dollar demarcations for compensation totals.
On January 17, 1941, Molotov asked German officials whether the parties could then work out an agreement for entry into the Axis pact. Molotov expressed astonishment at the absence of any answer to the Soviets' November 25 offer to join the Pact. They never received an answer. Germany was already planning its invasion of the Soviet Union. On December 18, 1940, Hitler had signed War Directive No. 21 to the German high command for an operation now codenamed Operation Barbarossa stating: "The German Wermacht must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign." Hitler directed Raeder that Germany would have to take Polyanry and Murmansk at that time to cut off access to aid that would come to the Soviet Union.
Total Trade.
During both the first period of the 1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (February 11, 1940 to February 11, 1941) and the second (February 11, 1941 until the Pact was broken), Germany received massive quantities of raw materials, including over:
Large amounts of crude oil were delivered, with German documents in July 1940 already indicating that the Soviets had delivered crude oil at a rate of 150,000 tons a month for five months in 900 German tank cars exclusively reserved for it.
The trade pact helped Germany to surmount the British blockade of Germany. By June 1940, Soviet imports comprised over 50% of Germany's total imports, and often exceed 70% of total German imports before Hitler broke the pact in June 1941.
Hitler breaks the Pact.
On June 22, 1941, Germany began Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union through the territories that the two countries had previously divided. Despite fears causing the Soviet Union to enter deals with Germany in 1939, that Germany came so close to destroying the Soviet Union was due largely to Soviet actions taken from 1939 to 1941. Without Soviet imports, German stocks would have run out in several key products by October 1941, within three and a half months. Germany would have already run through their stocks of rubber and grain before the first day of the invasion were it not for Soviet imports:
Without Soviet deliveries of these four major items, Germany could barely have attacked the Soviet Union, let alone come close to victory, even with more intense rationing.
Three years later, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg was later executed as one of the conspirators in the July 20, 1944 Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Castilleja grisea

Castilleja grisea is a rare species of Indian paintbrush known by the common name San Clemente Island Indian paintbrush. It is endemic to San Clemente Island, one of the Channel Islands of California. San Clemente Island is owned by the US Navy so the Navy is involved in a management program to recover this species.
Description.
The San Clemente Island Indian paintbrush is a perennial herb coated densely in long gray hairs. The highly branching stem grows 40 to 60 centimeters tall and bears linear leaves each a few centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of layers of bracts one to two centimeters long, gray-green in color at the bases and tipped with greenish yellow. Between the bracts emerge dull yellow pouched flowers. The fruit is a capsule about a centimeter long containing tiny seeds with netted surfaces.
Distribution.
This species was once considered to be "relatively common" on its home island. Since then the habitat has been severely degraded, mainly by feral goats which were introduced there. The island was also used for grazing sheep and cattle, and some feral pigs were present. The animals may have eaten the plant at times, but they mainly damaged the land by trampling the soil, which led to soil compaction, loss of topsoil, and erosion. The introduction of exotic plant species such as ripgut brome ("Bromus diandrus"), wild oat ("Avena barbata"), and red brome ("Bromus madritensis rubus") also degraded the habitat.
Due to sttep terrain of San Clemente Island the exact abundance of "Castilleja grisea" is not currently known. Recent surveys have discovered new populations of this species. Surveys in 2007 estimate more than 10,000 plants existing. This plant has been a federally listed endangered species since 1977, when it was one of the first species to be designated so. The plant's population had been drastically reduced by the activity of the feral goats. Its populations has increased at least ten-fold since the removal of these non-native herbivores. The species has recovered so well through management programs by the Navy, it was recommended for downlisting during the last review conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Remaining threats include erosion, invasive grasses, and wildfire from military exercises.
The species has a relatively high genetic variability for an uncommon island endemic. This and its steady recovery from low numbers give an optimistic outlook for the species' recovery.

Cines del Sur

Cines del Sur is an International Film Festival in Granada, Spain, that focuses on emerging cinemas belonging to what is known as the geo-political south. Film productions (from Asia, Africa and Latin America) which often have limited distribution and screening opportunities find in Cines del Sur a platform to help them gain recognition.
Beyond its appearance as a showcase of films, Cines del Sur is also a place for encounters, discussion and sharing among professionals, film lovers and people interested in broadening their social, cultural, economic and political perspective of the globalized world. The festival encourages reflection and debate on the enormous value of diversity and cultural exchange.
Programming.
Sections.
Cines del Sur has two competitive sections: the Official Section, for feature-length works filmed in 35 mm, and the Mediterráneos Section, with awards given to films made in video. 
The Itineraries Section (an informative section) is a sample of productions from countries of the geopolitical south. 
The Festival brings together an international jury each year to choose the winning films.
Retrospectives.
The festival offers two retrospectives that can have different focal points, ranging from tributes to particular filmmakers to film series organised by subject matter, and even retrospectives that take an in-depth look at filmmakers who are still active, at a certain historical period or at a country with limited production.
Open screen.
While the festival takes place, several squares and public buildings in Granada become large outdoor cinemas, where all kinds of people come together to enjoy the films shown.
Parallel activities.
A number of events with scholars in the field are organised during the festival and throughout the year, as are film and video workshops, exhibits, seminars, round tables and outdoor screenings.
Publications.
Study and reflection on the cinemas of the south find their place in the Festival’s publications, which serve to inform readers about the films screened and the subjects and figures who receive tribute in the retrospectives.

Stump sock

Stump socks are tubular medical or clothing accessories with a blind end that are fashioned similar to socks, usually without a heel. They are worn on amputation stumps for a number of reasons. As stump socks are typically worn on body parts that do "not" contain a foot, their definition is distinct from the average sock type garment. 
Amputation stumps can be sensitive to cold or heat, particularly as their capacity to regulate tissue congestion is limited. The skin of amputation stumps can be very sensitive to allergic, chemical or mechanical irritation and thus may have to be protected. 
There are different types of stump socks, some of which are available individually made to fit, some as industrially manufactured items:

Irungattukottai Race Track

The Irungattukottai Race Track is a permanent motor racing circuit located in Irungattukottai, Sriperumbudur, Chennai, India. It was built in the late 1980s and was inaugurated in 1990. It is the first of its kind in India and is owned and operated by the Madras Motor Sports Club. Irungattukottai track is where the motor sport in India grew from, and Irungattukottai has been central to Indian motor racing.
History.
Chennai had widely regarded as the cradle of Indian motorsport and had remained the prime venue for motorsport in India ever since the beginning of the sport in the country. The influence had extended throughout the southern India, with the Madras Motor Sports Club, Coimbatore Auto Sports Club and Karnataka Motor Sports Club being among the primary clubs organizing motorsports events in the country. In 1971, these clubs, along with Calcutta Motor Sports Club and Mumbai's Indian Automotive Racing Club, united to form the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI), headquartered in Chennai, to ensure common regulations and orderly conduct of events.
Race meets were held on abandoned airstrips, such as the ones at Sholavaram in Chennai, Sulur airstrip in Coimbatore, and Agram in Bangalore. The Sholavaram airstrip in Chennai is regarded as the original Mecca of motor racing. During race weekends, Sholavaram was invariably packed with spectators and the government had organized special bus services to the venue during such times. In 1990, when the Irungattukottai track was built, it became the prime motor sport venue in the country.
The track.
The Full Circuit (main track) is long. It has 12 turns and 3 straights, with the longest one being 250 m. The Club Circuit is long and has 7 turns. Both tracks are 11 m wide with 12 m at the start line and operate in a clockwise direction. Irungattukottai Race Track is a Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile and Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme-certified circuit.
The first race was held in 1990 and the tracks were fully resurfaced in 2007. Vehicles allowed for races include bikes of all categories and cars up to F3.

Nathan Wylde

Nathan Wylde is a fictional character from the British ITV1 soap opera "Emmerdale", played by Lyndon Ogbourne. He made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2009.
Storylines.
2009–10.
Nathan and his sister, Maisie, arrive in the village for their father's 50th birthday party. Nathan is immediately attracted to Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), and when he hears that she has a date with Lee Naylor (Lewis Linford), Nathan delays him with questions about his work. Nathan - who attended agricultural college - is tasked with running the estate by his parents. Nathan continues pursuing Katie, causing trouble between her and Lee by successfully manipulating them both. Following a row with Lee, Katie invites Nathan to spend the night with her. The next day, however, she catches him sneaking out and he admits to not wanting a serious relationship until he sees her reconcile with Lee.
Nathan works with Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), assisting his campaign to be re-elected as local councillor, getting to Eric's son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) who was standing against him, via his girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi). He gives her a job, an advance for new clothes and makes a large donation to her mother's nursing home. On finding out, Leyla asks him to withdraw it but he refuses, making it clear what he wants in return. Disgusted, she throws a suit at him and leaves. She tells David and they confront Nathan who loses his temper, and Leyla throws water over him to cool down. However, on 4 June, David is elected as councillor. In late June, Nathan is angry about Lee moving in with Katie so he causes trouble for them again and Lee quits his job. Angry, Katie ends her relationship with Nathan and throws Lee out. Nathan responds by trying to sabotage her business and Katie responds by telling him she is moving her business elsewhere but when this fails, Nathan delights in raising her rent.
Nathan befriends Ryan Lamb (James Sutton). He is not pleased when Ryan and Katie start dating but is more distressed with his father's "affair" with Ryan's mother Faye (Kim Thomson). He goes to London for a while to clear his head. Returning his attentions to Leyla in October, Nathan separates her and David by using his parents' contacts to get David more work. Leyla doesn't help when she borrows money from the petty cash in the farm shop's till and is caught when Nathan collects it early. He sees money missing but conceals it when Leyla confesses and starts charming her, taking her to exclusive parties. They sleep together but Leyla feels guilty so Nathan blackmails her to take responsibility for him crashing a car whilst drunk. Struggling with her conscience, Leyla tells David that she slept with Nathan and he splits up with her but he hits Nathan for bullying her. Nathan's mother Natasha realises that something is wrong and asks Katie, who tells her David hit Nathan but Nathan twists it so that Leyla gets the blame. Angry at Nathan's manipulation, she visits him and tells him she won't quit her job and knees him in the groin. After this, Nathan leaves Leyla alone.
In January, after his father's disappearance, Nathan takes over running Home Farm so Natasha can concentrate on taking care of Maisie and Will. Nathan is furious to discover that Faye is, in fact, Mark's first wife and Ryan is his half-brother, and that Natasha knew. Later in the month Natasha begins behaving erratically. Noticing her odd behaviour, Nathan confronts her and she tells him that she killed Mark and buried his body on the Estate grounds. Nathan is outraged and takes a shovel and tries to locate his father's body and dig it up. Natasha then subdues Nathan by telling him that it had been an accident and that the gun had discharged during a struggle. Nathan agrees to keep his mother's secret but demands her fortune in return. Natasha reluctantly gives him everything on the condition that he left and never returned. Nathan keeps his side of the bargain and leaves the village in early February.
In May 2010, Nathan returns, shocking his mother. She tells him to leave, and he stays the night at the B&B. Natasha later agrees to let him stay at Home Farm on one condition, that he pay back the money he blackmailed from her. Nathan pays back the money and Natasha lets him work for her again. Nathan takes an instant dislike to his mother's new business partner, Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) who had bought Nathan's share of the estate whilst he had been away. Nathan demanded his share back but Declan refuses to give it to him. Nathan is further enraged when Declan and Natasha begin a relationship and he threatens to report her to the police for his father's murder but Natasha threatens to take him down with her for helping her cover up the crime.
Nathan makes a deal with Declan after his plans for a barn renovation are turned down. Nathan offers to get the planning permission for Declan if he agreed to stay away from Natasha. To do this, Nathan blackmails local councillor David. He gets council employee Tania Page to attempt to seduce David and records it with a hidden video camera and makes it seem that he is having an affair. Nathan threatens to tell Leyla and show her the video if David did not agree to his demands. After David gets Nathan the planning permission, Declan notices that David appears unhappy and Nathan reveals that he blackmailed David, leaving Declan horrified.
In June 2010, a bouquet of flowers is sent to Home Farm and is signed with Mark's name and is paid for using his credit card. Natasha believes that Nathan sent the flowers as part of a sick joke and she throws them at his car as he drives up to the house. One of Mark's suits is sent to Declan's house and he confronts Nathan and accuses him of sending it. Nathan denies sending the flowers and the suit but he later pretends to confess to sending the flowers to Maisie in order to cover his mother's tracks.
Believing Nathan is the culprit, Maisie is upset and angry with him and orders him out of the pub when he comes in for a drink. Nathan goes to his car and discovers a not stuck to the windscreen saying "What are you hiding"? Nathan sees Ryan walking past and accuses him of being the stalker. Ryan is angry at the accusation and he and Nathan square up but Ryan's boss Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) breaks them up. Nathan gets in his car and drives home. Nathan later receives another note from the blackmailer arranging a meeting by the river. Nathan drives to the location and waits. The blackmailer reveals himself and it turns out to be Cain. Nathan asks Cain what he wants and Cain tells him that he knows the Wyldes are hiding something. He asks Nathan to arrange a meeting between him and Natasha before leaving. Natasha later pays Cain to keep quiet and stay away from their family.
In July 2010 Mark's body is discovered by Sam Dingle (James Hooton) whilst he is walking his dog. Nathan and Natasha agree to frame Faye for the murder. But Nathan frames Ryan instead, planting the murder weapon at the garage where Ryan works, and after gaining entry to Ryan's home, planting gunpowder residue on one of Ryan's shirts. He also steals one of Ryan's gold necklaces and plants it at the scene of the crime. The day after Mark's body is found, Nathan is arrested and questioned by the police but later released without charge due to a lack of evidence. However, during his interrogation he discovers that Mark was shot from six feet away and that Natasha had been lying when she said that Mark's death had been accidental, during a struggle. When he returns home, Nathan tells Natasha that if she doesn't help prove his innocence, he will report her to the police himself.
Ryan is later arrested after the police discover his chain at the scene of the crime. He is then charged with the murder after the police discover the gun buried at the garage. Nathan taunts Cain, knowing that Cain cannot help Ryan without incriminating himself for fraud and blackmail. At Mark's funeral Nathan is visibly upset at the loss of his father. However he is furious when he sees that Ryan had been given permission to attend the funeral. When Ryan attempts to ask Maisie to believe that he is innocent Nathan attacks him. Asking him if this was Ryan's "final desperate plea" and calling his sibling "pathetic", Nathan is delighted when Natasha tells the prison guards to take Ryan away.
When Maisie discovers a picture on her mobile phone of Ryan wearing his necklace after the murder occurred she becomes convinced of his innocence, much to Nathan's horror. After distracting her in the cafe, he steals her phone from her bag after she goes to the toilet and deletes the picture but she manages to obtain another copy from Katie. After Cain tells Maisie about the blackmail and being paid by Natasha to keep quiet, she confronts Nathan and Natasha and demands the truth. She accuses Nathan of committing the murder and brands him a coward. Nathan is horrified that his sister thinks he is a murderer and begs Natasha to tell Maisie he is innocent and she does so. But Maisie does not believe them and leaves the village.
When Mark's will is read, Nathan receives his inheritance and flaunts his wealth, telling Faye and David that he will be test driving new cars. Nathan is outraged when Faye tells them she will contest the will. Nathan later visits Ryan is prison to gloat and mockingly asks him to tell Faye not to contest the will. When Nathan implies that he will hurt Faye, Ryan attacks him and the brothers have to be separated. Nathan later discovers that Ryan is in a relationship with prison guard Abi Peterson (Catherine Tyldesley) when he sees her leaving Faye's house and recognizes her from the prison visiting room. Abi calls him scumbag and he threatens to tell the prison service. Abi is later transferred to another prison. Nathan lets himself into Faye's house after she accidentally leaves the back door open and taunts her, telling her that Ryan's relationship with Abi would have serious repercussions for him at the trial. Faye throws Nathan out.
Maisie later returns to the village and avoids Nathan, whenever he comes near her. She goes to stay at Faye's house and Nathan accuses her of trying to prove the innocence of their father's killer. Nathan later tells Natasha that he can't cope with lying to Maisie any more and considers telling her thr truth. But Natasha tells him that because Maisie is fragile, due to her previous mental health problems, the truth would be too much for her and it would cause her to go off the rails again. Nathan breaks down in tears in his mother's arms.
The following day, Nathan tells Natasha he is looking forward to seeing Ryan get imprisoned and she is relieved to have him on her side again. Maisie asks to meet Nathan and again asks him the truth about Mark's death but again he tells her that Ryan is the killer. She leaves angrily. When Ryan's trial begins Nathan is nervous about giving evidence. However when he testifies against his brother, he gives the jury the impression that Ryan is unstable due to his relationship with Maisie and the revelations about their true identities, and that Ryan is jealous of the Wylde's for having the family he never had. After giving evidence, Nathan is kidnapped by Cain and held captive in the Dingles' old barn. He tries to free himself but is unsuccessful. He offers Cain money but Cain refuses it and tells Nathan that if Ryan is found guilty, he will kill him but would release him if he is found not guilty. He pours beer over Nathan and taunts him. After Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) and Cain's girlfriend and second cousin Charity Tate (Emma Atkins) try to enter the barn and nearly discover Nathan, Cain moves him to an abandoned barn on the moors.
Charity follows Cain to the barn and discovers he is holding Nathan captive. Whilst Cain and Charity argue, Nathan tries to free himself and is nearly successful but Cain catches him in time and with Charity's help, holds him down and reties the ropes holding him. After Ryan is found guilty Cain receives a text message telling him of the development and he tells Nathan things have got a lot worse for him. Nathan is terrified. Cain summons Maisie to the barn and when Nathan sees her, he begs her to help him. Maisie refuses and demands the truth from Nathan about the circumstances of their father's death, still believing Nathan to be the killer.
She attacks Nathan with a piece of wood in an attempt to get him to confess to the murder. Distraught and believing that Maisie would kill him, Nathan reveals that Natasha is Mark's killer but Maisie refuses to believe him. Cain goes to Home Farm and summons Natasha and Will. They arrive in time to see Maisie about to hit Nathan with the wood. In order to pacify Maisie, Natasha confesses that she killed Mark. Maisie calls the police and Nathan begs Natasha to run away and tell the police Cain forced her to confess but Natasha refuses and is arrested.
The following day Nathan walks through the village in a daze still recuperating from his injuries, inflicted on him by Cain and Maisie. Nathan visits Maisie at Faye's house and convinces her to visit Natasha in prison. Maisie apologizes to Nathan to believing him to be the killer. When Maisie visits Natasha and demands the whole truth, Natasha cover for Nathan and does not tell Maisie of his involvement in framing Ryan. When she returns to Home Farm, Maisie admits that she would try and be a family with Nathan again for Will's sake. Maisie moves back in with Nathan and Will at Home Farm despite Ryan's objections. After the Wyldes decide to leave Emmerdale and move back to London for a fresh start, Nathan is approached by Declan who offers to buy out Natasha's 49% ownership of Home Farm. He tells Nathan that if he convinces his mother to sell to him then Nathan would receive the money from Natasha's share of Home Farm instead of Natasha receiving it. Natasha signs over all her assets to Nathan.
Nathan refuses point blank to accept Declan's offer so he sets about finding a new buyer. After a few weeks, he finally finds a buyer and celebrates in The Woolpack by drinking a glass of champagne with barmaid Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), Leyla's sister. Ryan tries to start an argument with Nathan and after he insults Alicia, Nathan defends her and squares up to Ryan. Ryan leaves the pub and throws a brick through Nathan's car window. Nathan then attacks Ryan and Maisie is forced to separate them. Alicia then leaves after Leyla and Davids tell her what Nathan is really like. The buyer comes to look at Home Farm, and then subsequently reduces her offer. Nathan is furious and refuses to accept, but after Maisie begs him to reconsider, he does so and signs the paperwork. When he introduces the buyer to Declan, he is outraged to discover that he has been tricked when it is revealed that the buyer is Declan's ex-wife Ella Hart (Corrinne Wicks). Nathan refuses to let Declan have Home Farm but knows that he is unable to do anything as the deeds have been signed over.
Nathan attends Natasha's sentencing and is horrified when she is ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years by the judge. Nathan drowns his sorrows in the pub and goads Ryan about being rich and having Maisie and Will choose him over Ryan. Ryan tries to attack Nathan and Declan and Cain are forced to restrain him. Cain orders Nathan to leave the pub and Ryan vows revenge on his brother. He and Declan concoct a plan to bring Nathan down. Ryan goes to Home Farm whilst Nathan is packing up and demands the truth about why Nathan set him up for Mark's murder. After Nathan gloats, Ryan again pleads for the truth, and tricks Nathan into confessing to setting him up after accusing Natasha of doing it because Nathan was too stupid. Unbeknownst to Nathan, Declan had hidden a recording device under the sofa that had picked up everything he had said. Ryan then plays the recording to Maisie and she angrily confronts Nathan. Furious that he had lied to her again and disgusted with his actions, Maisie leaves Home Farm despite Nathan's pleas for her to stay. He also begs Will but he is equally disgusted with Nathan for lying and leaves with Maisie.
The following day Nathan goes to Ryan's house. Ryan goads Nathan and threatens to call the police and unless Nathan gets down on his knees and begs. Nathan refuses at first but when Ryan picks up the phone, he complies out of desperation much to Ryan's enjoyment. He offers Ryan anything to make up for what he has done. Ryan said that he should give his money and put it to a trust fund for Will. When he told Maisie this, he doesn't realise that Ryan was standing behind him. He pinned him towards his car and told them that if he goes anywhere near Will or Maisie again, they will go straight to the police and if he doesn't, Maisie will. He went back to the office, asking where his belongings are. Declan says they are in storage and he had nothing all along. He then demands his keys to the house and the car. Nathan purposely drops them on the floor. Declan throws him to the floor, standing on his back, ordering him to pick them up. Nathan does so and Declan throws him outside onto the driveway, telling him to get lost. Nathan gets up and walks away, leaving Emmerdale with nothing, having lost his belongings, his money and his family.
Character creation and development.
Casting.
On 19 January 2009, media entertainment website "Digital Spy" reported that "Emmerdale" would be introducing Natasha (Amanda Donohoe) and Mark Wylde's (Maxwell Caulfield) three children. Actor Lyndon Ogbourne was cast in the role of Nathan, the eldest child of Natasha and Mark and the brother of Maisie (Alice Coulthard) and Will (Oscar Lloyd). Of his casting, Ogbourne stated: "I am really excited to be playing the role of Nathan Wylde. He is a bit of a rogue and I'm looking forward to bringing out his darker side. He's definitely not as nice as he seems." Asked about if he has settled in Ogbourne said: "It's been really cool. I'd heard amazing things about the cast and crew before I joined and it's cheesy to say it but it's entirely true - everyone's so warm and welcoming. It's very much been a case of me being thrown in at the deep end with long, all-consuming days. But I think that's the best way to be, though."
Characterisation.
ITV1 describe Nathan as "scheming and manipulative", and "always wants his own way". Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe him as "privileged".
Possible return?
Ogbourne stated in an Interview with Digital Spy that Nathan Wylde could soon be returning to Emmerdale. He stated that he is currently in talks with the shows producers.
Reception.
Holy Soap describe Nathan's most memorable moment as: "Being kicked in the groin by Leyla after she found out he was manipulating her and David." Nathan was nominated in the category of "Villan of the Year" at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Maisie Wylde

Maisie Wylde (previously Foster) is a fictional character in the British ITV1 soap opera "Emmerdale", played by Alice Coulthard. The character was introduced by series producer Anita Turner and first appeared in 2009. It was announced on 30 June 2010 that Alice Coulthard had quit the show and her character would be written out later in the year. 
Creation.
The character was first introduced to "Emmerdale" in February 2009, by series producer Anita Turner played by Alice Coulthard. The character was introduced as a 'fun time girl' and would 'cause a lot of trouble' for her parents, she is the daughter of Natasha (Amanda Donohoe) and Mark (Maxwell Caulfield). It was later revealed that Maisie had only been married six weeks earlier, but left her new husband soon after, moving to the village along with her two brothers and her parents.
Storylines.
2009–11.
Maisie comes to the village for her father's 50th birthday party. At the party, she kisses Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher), and later that evening, tells her family that her marriage is over, despite only marrying six weeks before. Her husband Tristan arrives to collect Maisie after Natasha calls him, unaware Maisie had previously left him. She tells Nathan that she is fed up of Tristan's precise and tidy behaviour but agrees to go home with him.
However, as they are leaving, Maisie changes her mind and goes to the Woolpack, where she stays overnight. The next day, she asks if they need any staff, getting a job as barmaid. Within weeks, she decides she wants to own the pub and her father talks to Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) about buying it. Val and Maisie try persuading Val's sister Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen), to retire but Natasha calls off the sale when she finds out.
In March, she starts dating Andy, much to her family's horror - hearing gossip about Andy from Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) and Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) - so she claims she is dating Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock). However, she continues seeing Andy in secret until Debbie Dingle reveals the truth in the Woolpack so they date publicly. In mid-April, after a row with Natasha at a shooting party, Maisie moves in with Andy. By May, after getting fed up with being expected to help on Andy's farm, look after the farmhouse and Andy's daughter Sarah (Sophia Amber Moore), Maisie ends their relationship, returning to the pub until fellow lodger Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) sends her back to Home Farm.
Maisie flirts with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), in a relationship that intensifies, due to her parents' disapproval. Cain ends the relationship when Maisie has given him enough material to blackmail Mark. Attempting to forget him, Maisie goes on holiday with Natasha but Natasha returns alone, revealing that Maisie is having too much fun in Brazil to come home yet.
Maisie falls in love with Ryan Lamb (James Sutton). They keep their relationship a secret because Ryan had previously been in a relationship with Maisie's best friend, Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward). Ryan ends his relationship with Katie, but did not tell her why. Their parents catch them as they are about to sleep together and tell them they are siblings. A sickened Maisie lashes out at everyone, throwing a bowl of oranges and crumpling to the floor as she realises that she almost slept with her half-brother. Comforted by Katie one night, she is devastated when she discovers Ryan is sleeping on Katie's sofa. She is devastated, unable to simply "turn off" her feelings for Ryan. Maisie suffers a nervous breakdown, leading to her drinking excessively at work. After Natasha has to identify a body believed to be Mark's, Maisie and Nathan explain to Will that Mark is not going to come back, as he believes. Maisie's erratic behaviour continues and Natasha books her into a clinic in order for her to recover for her ordeal, and after a few weeks she returns home, learning to get along with her now extended family, and resolve her problems. Her friendship with Katie sours after Nathan tells Katie about her relationship with Ryan. She eventually establishes an amicable relationship with Ryan.
Maisie begins dating Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) after realising that they have a mutual attraction to each other, and for a while they are happy together. 
Maisie's life begins to fall apart again in July 2010, when her father's body is found in the grounds of Home Farm, and a murder investigation is launched. When the police begin to question her, she reveals her relationship with Ryan, and Nathan's anger at their closeness. After visiting Ryan, Maisie is shocked, after returning to Home Farm, to discover that Nathan has been arrested, and finds it hard to believe that her brother is capable of such murder. After he is released, however, she questions his whereabouts on the night of Mark's death and he is angered that she doubts his innocence. But Maisie is left even more shocked when a chain at the crime scene links Ryan to the murder. Finding it hard to believe, Nathan and Natasha manipulate her into thinking Ryan was upset enough to commit the crime. Ryan is subsequently charged with their father's murder and remanded in custody. 
Cain confronts Maisie in The Woolpack and he taunts her that Ryan is innocent. Unsure of what to believe, Maisie later begins to delete photos of Ryan of her phone. After coming across a video taken four months after her father's death, she is stunned to see that Ryan is wearing the chain that was near discovered near the body, meaning that he could not have been the killer. Showing her mother and Nathan the video, Maisie struggles to make a decision of whether she should show the police, but doubts start to form in her mind over Ryan's guilt. Deciding to go to the police, Nathan offers to go with her, before stealing the phone from her bag in the cafe whilst Maisie visits the toilet. Natasha and Nathan pretend to help her search for the phone, whilst behind her back, they delete the footage and dispose of it. 
At her father's funeral, Ryan is released to attend the ceremony and by the graveside, he makes a plea for Maisie to visit him, having heard about the phone from his solicitor. Later, Natasha's boyfriend Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) gives her advice and she leaves the wake and goes to see Ryan. At the prison, she reluctantly reveals her thoughts that Nathan is responsible for the theft of her phone and framing Ryan. She leaves hastily, but promises not to give up on him. The following day, Sam Dingle (James Hooton) admits that he found Mark's wallet in the woods and gave it to Cain, his half-brother. Cain visits Maisie and reveals his blackmailing of Natasha and Nathan, but he tells her that he cannot go to the police without incriminating himself for blackmail and deception. Breaking down in Declan's house, Maisie reveals that she believes Nathan killed her father and that Natasha was covering for him. The pair vow to help clear Ryan's name and free him from prison.
Katie shows Maisie a photograph, taken at the same time as the video she found on her phone, and it also shows Ryan wearing the chain. Confronting Nathan, Maisie accuses him of killing their father and framing Ryan. Nathan struggles to believe her accusations and angrily shouts that she is trying to free their father's killer, and snipes that she and Ryan will never be together as they are related, prompting Maisie to slap him. Natasha tries to calm the situation, but when she refuses to confess her involvement, Maisie leaves. Discussing with Nikhil, she decides to get away as she believes that she cannot help Ryan if she has another breakdown. Despite pleas from Nikhil, Declan and Ryan, Maisie leaves the village. On 13 October, Maisie returns and visits Ryan in Prison and lets him know that she has done a lot of thinking and is prepared to help him prove that Nathan killed Mark.
When Ryan is tried and found guilty of Mark's murder, both Maisie and Ryan's mother Faye (Kim Thomson), Mark's first wife, are upset and angry as they both believe that Nathan killed Mark. After leaving the court, Maisie gets a text message from Cain telling her to go to a certain location to meet him. Maisie arrives at an abandoned barn and discovers that Cain has kidnapped Nathan and is holding him prisoner. She goes into the barn and pins Nathan, who is tied to a chair, to the floor. Maisie angrily states that she saw him and Natasha lie in court and resulting in Ryan being imprisoned. She tells Nathan that she hates him and picks up a piece of wood. She demands Nathan tell her the truth about their father's death and is about to hit him. Nathan then tells her that Natasha killed Mark, but initially Maisie does not believe him. Cain brings Natasha and Will to the barn and walks in just as Maisie is about to hit Nathan. To placate her daughter, Natasha tells Maisie that Nathan is telling the truth and that she killed Mark, not Nathan. Maisie demands Natasha to explain, just as Will enters the barn and overhears her confession. Natasha tells Maisie that Mark had treated her badly which is why she killed him. Maisie calls the police and Natasha is arrested. Maisie visits her in prison and demands to know the whole truth but Natasha lies to protect Nathan and Maisie refuses to ever visit her again. 
In November, Ryan tells Maisie that Nathan framed him and plays a recording he made after tricking Nathan into confessing. Maisie angrily confronts Nathan and, disgusted, she and Will leave Home Farm, despite his pleas for them to stay. Maisie and Will go to stay at Holdgate Farm with Nikhil. After Ryan orders him to, Nathan goes to Holdgate and tells Maisie how they could solve their problems by him sending all the money he owned to a trust fund for Will. Ryan is standing behind Nathan whilst he tells Maisie this and tells him that if he goes anywhere near Maisie and Will again, they will go to the police. Maisie rejects her brother and tells him to never show his face again.
Maisie becomes closer to Nikhil and he later proposes to her. Maisie hesitates at first but later accepts his proposal much to the dismay of both Will and Nikhil's brother Jai (Chris Bisson). Ella Hart (Corrinne Wicks) organises an engagement party for Nikhil and Maisie at Home Farm. Initially the party seems to be going well and Maisie appears to be happy, but after Nikhil attempts to bond with Will and encourage him, Will loses his temper and breaks down in tears stating that Nikhil was no replacement for his real family. 
On seeing how badly Will distressed, Maisie finally admit to Nikhil that she does not love him and had only agreed to marry him in order to provide stability for Will. She breaks off their engagement and gives Nikhil his ring back and later tells him that she felt she was using him and apologizes. She also tells Nikhil that it is best for them is she leaves the village. Maisie decides to move to Dartford with Will to stay with their Aunt for a fresh start. She informs Ryan of their plans and he encourages her by telling her she is doing the right thing and it would be better for them all. Ryan comes to Holdgate Farm and says goodbye to both Maisie and Will. Maisie tearfully says goodbye to Nikhil and gets into a taxi with Will and they are driven out of the village.

Mohammad Nabi Pashto:محمد نبي عيسی خېل (born 3 March 1985) is a right-handed batsman and off break bowler who plays for and captains Afghanistan. He is the current captain of Afghanistan Cricket team. In 2013 Mohammad Nabi was bought by Sylhet Royals for a reported amount of $30,000 to play in Bangladesh Premier League.
National Team.
Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. 
He has been a key player for the up-and-coming Afghan team, and has been influential in Afghanistan's rapid rise through the ranks of international cricket, taking 11 wickets during the 2009 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, helping Afghanistan finish top and to progress to the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. After finishing 5th and gaining One Day International status Nabi made his ODI debut against Scotland top scoring for Afghanistan with 58 runs.
In Afghanistan's first match of the Intercontinental Cup, which was Afghanistan's debut first-class match, Nabi made 102 in Afghanistan's first innings against a Zimbabwe XI in a team total of 427 all out.
In February 2010, Nabi made his Twenty20 International debut against Ireland, where he took a single wicket. Despite this, Afghanistan lost the match by 5 wickets.
In November 2010, Nabi was appointed Afghanistan's captain for Asian Games however Nawroz Mangal was restored as Captain after the tournament. Under Nabi's captaincy Afghanistan finished runners-up, losing only to Bangladesh in the final.
In March 2013, Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) announced that Mohammad Nabi, will lead the national side in the ICC Intercontinental Cup in the UAE, after Nawroz Mangal was stripped of the captaincy following his dismal show in the limited-over series in Pakistan the previous month. Afghanistan began life under Nabi's captaincy with a comfortable win in the first of two Twenty20 internationals against Scotland in Sharjah. Nabi took two wickets for 12 runs in four overs.
Club career.
Mohammad Nabi in club level has played for Sylhet Royals of Bangladesh, Afghan Cheetahs in Pakistan and Marylebone Cricket Club in UK.
Afghan Cheetahs - Marylebone Cricket Club.
Nabi played for the Afghan Cheetahs team which competed in the Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup 2011-12 in Pakistan. He also played for Marylebone Cricket Club alongside Hamid Hassan.They played on behalf of MCC for the curtain raiser of the English county season against champion Nottinghamshire on March 27–31, 2011. MCC defeated Nottinghamshire by 174 runs and Hamid Hassan took 7 wickets and Nabi 2 wickets.They also played for the MCC in the Twenty20 side as they took on Nottinghamshire, Durham, Sussex and a select Fly Emirates side, in the Emirates Airline Twenty20 Trophy on 1 April.
Sylhet Royals.
In January–February 2013 Nabi played for Bangladesh Premier League side Sylhet Royals and helped his team reach the Semi-finals with some excellent performances. He took 16 wickets in 13 matches for Royals and was one of the top batsmen in the tournament. After the Royals had lost Andre Russell due to an injury, their search for an allrounder stopped at Nabi. The demand for the offspinner had come from the team's coach Mohammad Salahuddin, who has been vindicated by Nabi's performance.
He took 2 for 15 in the first match to give the Royals a controlled start against Barisal Burners – a 33-run win. Two more tight spells were followed by his first significant contributions with the bat. In a big chase against Chittagong Kings, Nabi's sense of occasion came forth. His 43 wasn't smash and grab as they chased 173 runs to win, but a more measured effort that gave his side their best win in the tournament's first phase. He had a lull in the next four games before picking up two three-wicket hauls against the Kings and the Khulna Royal Bengals. Nabi has done well at the start of games, having opened the bowling on several occasions. He quickly realised when to slow down his pace or push the ball through to defend against attacking batsmen.
"Nabi made a good start to the tournament, and after a slow period in the middle, he has again started doing well," Salahuddin said. "He is a good cricketer with a lot of variations and it is clear he understands the game quickly. He carries out the plans that we set for him for every batsmen."
Salahuddin had observed Nabi and his team-mate Stirling throughout their BPL campaigns and didn't spot much of a difference between them and cricketers from Test nations. "I don't see them much different, they seem to catch on-field situations quickly. I think they are very hungry," he said. "Their attitude has helped our team do well. They have team feelings, and never seemed like outsiders to me. I think they make good team-mates."
In the race to the final match against Dhaka Gladiators, Nabi took the wicket of Chris Gayle who smashed 114 from 51 balls (last 87 runs off 22) to help Dhaka Gladiators enter the final. Nabi finished his innings taking two wickets (economy of 4.25). In Semi-final match against Chittagong Kings, Nabi took two more wickets but couldn't stop the Kings winning the match.
