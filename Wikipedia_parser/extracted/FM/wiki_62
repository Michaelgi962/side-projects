Carlos hires his ex-roommate Lucy and Gaby is fine with it at first but grows jealous so she demands Carlos hire Lynette. Lynette plays them, by telling them that she has been offered a higher salary from another company, which prompts Carlos to raise her salary to $100,000. Through Lucy, Lynette figures out why Gaby hired her and Gaby finds out Lynette had no other job offer, however both are satisfied. Lynette gets her higher wage and Gaby gets her spy.
Meanwhile, Edie goes to the local newspaper to dig up information on Dave's family and learns that Dave had a daughter that was killed in the same crash as his wife. Later, Edie asks Dave how he feels about children and he tells her that a "friend" of his had a daughter he loved who died in a car crash and part of him died with her and lives his life wondering what she would've looked like and how old she would've been, so Dave tells her he would never want a child as it wouldn't be worth it. Back at the newspaper, an intern finds an article revealing that Mike would not be charged in the deaths of Lila and Paige Dash, but is told to wait until tomorrow to give it to Edie.
While talking to Gaby and Susan, Bree discovers they both have had things go missing and Gaby believes that it was Juanita. Bree quickly drives off and when Orson comes home, he finds that Bree has put all the stuff he stole on the table and demands to know why the stealing is still going on and thinks it would be a good idea to see a therapist.

Geography.
The climate is characteristical for that of the country, with a temperature variation slightly below average. January sees temperatures between -1 and 9 degrees Celsius, in comparison to an average of 17.8 in July. The Odra River flows from the southeast to the northwest of the district, and is the area's main watercourse. This stretch is navigable and is frequently used for water transport. The river's water levels reach their highest state from February - March and July - August, whereas they are lowest from September - October. Several other waterways, such as the Mala Panew, Żydówka, Brynica, Jemielnica, Swornica, and Brzeziczanka form a vast river network in the area, in addition to numerous streams. Several ponds, oxbow lakes, and a network of canals and drainage ditches are also situated in the town's vicinity. The Brynica and Odra rivers are characterized by relatively flat surrounds, thus the Dobrzen Wielki area is susceptible to flooding. One of the town's most catastrophic floods occurred in 1997, when water submerged land on both sides of the Odra river.
History.
The town's first written mentions of the town, cited as Dobren, can be derived from a document dated 1228, concerning the transfer of the Norbertine Monastery from Rybnik to the nearby village of Czarnowąs. A later document, however, dated 1279, provides the name of the town as Dobrzeń, and mentions that it is part of the province of Dobrzeń. The village itself was under the possession of Kazimierz, Duke of Opole, and in 1279, was granted Magdeburg rights. In 1658, the Church of St. Roch (Kosciol Sw. Rocha) was constructed, following the invasion of the Norbertine monastery by Protestant armies in 1643.

In January 1945, as the Soviet armies resumed their offensive and advanced into Germany, the prisoners were marched westward in the so-called Long March or Death March. Many of them died from the bitter cold and exhaustion. The lucky ones got far enough to the west to be liberated by the allied armies after some four months of travelling on foot in appalling conditions.

Tony Richards is a dark fantasy or horror author. He was born in 1956 in Greenford, England, and educated at University College School, Hampstead, before going on to study law at Middlesex University. Although he has written science fiction, mystery, and even mainstream stories, he is principally an author of supernatural, dark fantasy, and horror fiction. He has published three full-length novels, five novellas, and more than sixty short stories. His work has seen print in most major genre outlets, and he is a frequent contributor to Cemetery Dance Magazine and to anthologies compiled by the British editor Stephen Jones. An avid traveller, his fiction is often set in locations he has visited, most notably in his 2004 stand-alone novella Postcards from Terri, where the peripatetic heroine of the title goes to Hong Kong, Japan, Africa, Switzerland, Nicaragua, Istanbul, Budapest, Barcelona, Ottawa, Chicago, New York, Vancouver, and San Francisco during the course of the story. It is this quality that prompted the editor, publisher, and critic John Pelan to say of him: "He’s convincing … convincing enough that the locals will read about their city as described by Tony Richards and shudder. And that’s what we call a writers’ writer." He has twice been nominated, first in 1988 for the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel for "The Harvest Bride", and then in 2008 for the British Fantasy Award for Best Collection for "Going Back". He is married to Louise Richards, and lives in London. His latest novel, "Dark Rain", is set in the fictional town of Raine’s Landing, Massachusetts, and is intended to be the first of a series of books located there. The second such novel, "Night of Demons", is scheduled for publication in 2009.

Emu Brewery

The Emu Brewery was a brewery in Perth, Western Australia, which traced its history to the first decade of the colony. Founded in 1837 by James Stokes as the Albion Brewery, it was located beside the Swan River on a block bounded by Mounts Bay Road, Spring Street and Mount Street. The business changed hands — and names — several times, until its ultimate acquisition by competitor the Swan Brewery in 1927.
New brewery buildings were constructed over the years. The most notable of these was an imposing Art Deco building erected between 1936 and 1938. This building continued to be used to produce Emu-brand beer until the late 1970s, when production was shifted to a new factory in Canning Vale. Emu beer continues to be produced as a brand of Swan Brewery owner Lion Nathan.
Albion Brewery: 1837–1848.
In the early 1830s, the Swan River Colony was in its infancy and did not have a substantial local beer industry. Preachers from the Temperance League lobbied against the drunkenness prevalent in the Colony, however the lack of locally produced beer meant that they focused their attention on spirits drinkers. Governor James Stirling believed that the construction of a local brewery may reduce the Colony's drunkenness problems by allowing the men to drink beer instead of spirits.
Scotsman James Stokes had arrived in Western Australia in 1834 at the age of 24. He saw the opportunity in the market for a brewery, and investigated potential sites. Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe had set aside a small triangular lot for use as a brewery; this block was bounded by Spring Street, Mount Street and St Georges Terrace. Stokes preferred the much larger block across Spring Street, which extended almost all the way to the riverfront. The site was more suitable because it featured a natural spring, there was a sufficient different in elevation to enable the use of gravity in the brewing process without the need for a large tower. The proximity to the river also made river transport an attractive option. Stokes bought this land from George Leake, and was operating his brewery by 1837. Although the brewery was named the Albion Brewery after the ancient name for Great Britain, it was more popularly known as Stokes' Brewery. It was the colony's first major stand-alone brewery.
At the time, darker beer varieties were popular in Britain, however Stokes believed that the pale ales that were being exported to India would become popular locally. Contrary to what Governor Stirling had hoped, Stokes began distilling spirits at the brewery in 1838.
In 1839 Stokes mortgaged the brewery site back to the original owner, Leake, to fund the purchase of the adjacent block. There, he built himself a house; around this time he also bought the small portion of river frontage immediately in front of the brewery from the government for £13/5s/-. In the same year, Stokes also formed a partnership in land and commission agents with Dubois Aggett, however in 1840 Aggett maimed himself while attempting suicide, and Stokes severed the partnership.
1840 also saw the market for Albion Brewery's beer fall away due to a sluggish economy. It did not escape Stokes' attention that duties were levied on imported spirits, but not on those produced locally. Seizing upon the business opportunity, he imported a large still and expanded the brewery's distillery. The Government responded to this by imposing a tax on locally produced spirits as well, leading Stokes to stop Albion's distilling efforts.
Stanley Brewery: 1848–1908.
Eventually the market situation improved for Stokes to the point that in 1848 he opened a new brewery on the site to replace the old Albion Brewery. The Stanley Brewery opened on 1 November 1848, selling what it described as a "nutritious body ale superior to any imported", costing £4/– per hogshead.
Along with other local businessmen, Stokes successfully lobbied for the transportation of convicts to Western Australia to help alleviate the chronic labour shortage. It has also been speculated that he saw it as a potential new market for his beers, believing that the convicts would have less discerning tastes.
Stokes returned to England in 1857, where he married his cousin Julia. He returned to the Swan River Colony with his pregnant wife, however she died after giving birth. Stokes quickly lost his interest in brewing and died in 1861. The brewery continued to be operated by Henry Saw and William Meloy, who had worked in the business for many years and to whom Stokes had bequeathed interests in the business. Saw died in November 1870, and since Meloy did not want to remain in the operation, the lease over the brewery was advertised.
John Maxwell Ferguson took over the lease, and in 1872 recruited the German expatriate brewer William Mumme. Over the following decades, the business changed hands several times.
In 1887, a new brewery building was constructed on the site. The brick structure was imposing, featuring blind brick arches, and was topped with a Mansard-roofed tower containing a tank.
After the successful initial public offering of the rival Swan Brewery, the Stanley Brewery felt the pressure to follow the same path. In 1905 the business re-formed as the Stanley Co-operative Brewery Ltd, and had former politician Michael O'Connor as chairman of its board of directors. This new company was majority-owned by the Stanley Brewery Co Limited.
Emu Brewery: 1908 onwards.
The Stanley Brewery's most popular brand of beer was an ale sold under the "Emu" trademark. In order to ensure that drinkers knew from which brewery the Emu brand came, as well as to avoid confusion between the Stanley Co-operative Brewery Limited and its similarly named holding company, the company was renamed on 6 March 1908 to the Emu Co-operative Brewery Ltd.
The Emu Brewery had been turning out beer of variable quality, and only managed a quarter of the output of the Swan Brewery. However, the recruitment of Ernest Terry in 1909 led to a turnaround in the fortunes of the newly renamed Emu Brewery Ltd. The brewery became profitable once more, and even won awards for its beers at the Royal Agricultural Show, which dismayed the traditional award winner, Swan. Emu continued to compete with Swan by introducing Emu Bitter, a bottom-fermentation beer to compete with the bitter beer Swan introduced in 1923.
Acquisition by Swan Brewery and subsequent history.
On 3 February 1927, the brewery's directors approached the Swan Brewery to sell Emu's assets. Swan proceeded with this acquisition of the Emu Brewery, and continued to operate it as a separate business from Swan's own operations. Arthur Jacoby was appointed as the general manager of both breweries.
During the 1930s, a significant amount of land was reclaimed from the river, and the brewery lost its river frontage. Also, between 1936 and 1938, a new brewery building designed by Perth architectural firm Oldham, Boas and Ednie-Brown was constructed on the site. Constructed in the Art Deco style, this new building replaced the old Stanley Brewery building.
The building was built from reinforced concrete and steel, and was visibly divided into two halves: one with windows to allow in a maximum of daylight, and the other with no windows at all, to exclude daylight. A central tower housing a lift and staircases delineated the two areas. A border frieze at the top of three of the building's sides depicting different stages in the brewing process was designed by John Oldham and executed by sculptor Edward F. Kohler. An image of the 1938 building featured on Emu beer labels for over fifty years.
The Emu Brewery continued manufacturing on the site until the late 1970s, when production of both the Swan and Emu brands was shifted to a factory in Canning Vale. After this, the Emu Brewery building was left derelict. In 1991, the Emu Brewery was the "last major industrial structure" in Perth's central business district.
Despite having been placed on the Register of the National Estate, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. The Art Deco Society of Western Australia was set up in 1987 to lobby for the protection of Perth's art deco heritage, including the Emu Brewery. After heritage minister Jim McGinty refused to place the building on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places, the building was demolished in late 1991. Subsequent plans to build high-rise offices or apartments on the site have consistently fallen through, leading to the site being labelled "seemingly jinxed".

Hest Bank railway station

Hest Bank railway station was opened by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway (L&CR) three miles north of Lancaster Castle railway station. The line had been authorised in 1844 and a station was proposed for the village of Hest Bank, Lancashire, the following year. It opened in 1846 along with the line. The station continued to serve the village of Hest Bank until its closure in 1969. The site remains notable as being the point at which the present-day West Coast Main Line (WCML) comes nearest to the west coast. Views of Morecambe Bay can be glimpsed from trains on this section of the line.
Meanwhile, the "little" North Western Railway had been formed to link Skipton to Lancaster and with the Morecambe Harbour and Railway planned to make a junction with the L&CR at Hest Bank. Regrettably this never materialised. Hoping to develop an export trade in coke and other minerals, the L&CR applied on its own account to build the branch to Morecambe, receiving permission in 1859. At this point the line was leased by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and it was the latter that built the branch as a double track opening in 1864. In time however the branch was singled, but with an increase in holiday trade a south facing curve was added to the junction during 1888. Later a part of the branch from Bare Lane was redoubled and is still open as the Morecambe Branch Line. 
Hest Bank station itself was of rugged stone construction, a two-storey station house with a booking hall below on the up (southbound) platform. It was next to a level crossing over a minor road linking the A589 with houses, a water treatment works and a caravan park further along the foreshore. A small cottage for the crossing keeper was provided on the down (coastal-facing) side along with a footbridge to connect the platforms. The down side also had two sidings, one providing a bay platform. 
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
During the 'thirties the station became remarkable as the only one between Preston and Carlisle with electric lighting, thanks to the ingenuity of a member of staff. The goods yard closed on 2 December 1963 but the tracks were used for camping coaches until February 1969, when the station finally closed to passengers.
All trace of the platforms and buildings have disappeared apart from the crossing keeper's cottage, as the incoming Morecambe branch was extended along the length of one of the former platforms (as part of the layout changes associated with the 1973 WCML electrification scheme). 
The nearby signal box still stands although now disused. Its latter role, purely as a manually controlled gate box to supervise the adjacent level crossing and that at nearby Bolton-le-Sands, was brought to an end in the Spring of 2013. NR had published proposals to close the box here initially at the end of 2012, which was briefly postponed until February 2013 before the work was finally carried out in May. Both crossings are now worked direct from Preston PSB using CCTV.

The Fortria Chase is a Grade 2 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Navan over a distance of about 2 miles (3,219 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in November.
The event is named after Fortria, a successful Irish-trained chaser in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was formerly a handicap race, and it used to be open to horses aged four or older. It was given Grade 3 status in 1993, and its distance was extended by a furlong in 1996. It returned to its previous length in 2000, and at the same time it became a conditions race for five-year-olds and up. It was promoted to Grade 2 level in 2003.

Sita Devi (Maharani of Baroda)

Maharani Sita Devi Sahib of Baroda, born to Telugu family on May 12, 1917 in Madras, India, died February 15, 1989 in Paris, France. She was known as the “Indian Wallis Simpson". She was a colorful lady who led an extravagant life for over 40 years and was a member of the international jet set.
Biography.
The Maharani was the daughter of the Maharaja of Pithapuram - Sri Raja Rao Venkata Kumara Mahipati Surya Rau Bahadur Garu and his wife Sri Rani Chinnamamba Devi of Mirzapuram.
Sita Devi first married M.R.Apparao Bahadur, Zamindar of Vuyyuru.
By him she had one child Rajah M.Viduth Kumar Apparao.
She met her second husband, Pratap Singh Gaekwar of Baroda, at the Madras horse races in 1943. The Gaekwad was, at that time, considered the eight richest man in world. It was also reported he was the second richest Indian prince. The Gaekwad was mesmerised by Sita Devi. The lovers consulted with his legal team. The lawyers recommended that the Hindu Sita Devi convert to Mohammedanism. That would dissolve her marriage to the Zamindar under Indian law. She embraced Islam only to then adopt Hinduism once again. The Gaekwad took her as his second wife, which caused consternation with the British authorities, as this violated the antibigamy laws that the previous Gaekwad of Baroda enacted. The British Viceroy in New Delhi summoned the Gaekwad to contest this marriage. The latter argued that the law applied to the subjects of Baroda, and that he being their monarch was exempt from this law. This was confirmed by the Viceroy's legal advice. The British government accepted the marriage, but didn't refer to the Maharani as "her highness" as was the protocol for the princely states.
In 1946, the Gaekwad took his second wife on a tour of Europe. The reason for their visit was to find a suitable residence away from India. They found that the independent principality of Monaco was a suitable place to set up their second home. They bought a mansion in Monte Carlo and the Maharani took up permanent residence. The Gaekwad visited often, bringing some of the great treasures of Baroda to Monaco. The Maharani became the custodian of these treasures.
The couple also made two trips to the United States after the war. They went on a spending spree, buying all types of luxurious items. It was widely reported they spent $10 million on one of those trips. Indian officials audited the principality's finances. They concluded the Gaekwad had taken several large interest-free loans from the Baroda treasury. They demanded it be returned. The prince complied by making several payments from his $8 million-a-year income.
The princely couple transferred a copious amount from the Baroda treasury, including some of its most famous jewelry, including four celebrated pearl carpets, a famed seven-strand necklace of priceless pearls (called the Baroda pearls), a three-strand diamond necklace with the famous Pink Brazilian Star of the South diamond and the English Dresden diamond. The princely couple also had custody of the Empress Eugenie. When Baroda was integrated into the newly independent India,Indian officials were eventually able to recover some of the items, but some of the jewels had been transferred to the Maharani's ownership.
Years after the Maharani's death some of the precious items were discovered. In 1994 the pearl carpet were found in a Geneva vault. It was sold to an Arab prince for $31 million. Currently this carpet is displayed at the Museum of Islamic Art at Doha, Qatar, even though it was commissioned by an Indian Hindu Maharaja and not any Islamic ruler. The Star of the South and other gems were located with jewellers in Amsterdam.
Eventually, India, due to the discrepancies and possible fraud, deposed the Gaekwad in 1951 and his eldest son by his first wife succeeded him. Technically, the couple were not heads of state any longer, but they insisted on still being referred by their former titles.
She gave the Gaekwad one son, born in 1945, his name was Sayaji Rao Gaekwad. Nicknamed "Princie", he was the apple of her eye.
She attended some of the most exclusive events on the globe and partied with other international luminaries, i.e. Aristotle Onassis.
In 1953 the Maharani sold a pair of bejeweled anklets to Harry Winston. They had several large emeralds and diamonds. The jeweller set these stones into a spectacular necklace that was bought by the Duchess of Windsor Wallace Simpson. The Duchess wore this to a 1957 New York ball also attended by Sita Devi. When other guests were admiring the necklace. The Maharani was heard to exclaim that those jewels looked just as nice on her feet. The embarrassed Duchess returned the necklace to Winston. The Maharani was a car enthusiast and was reportedly very fond of her Mercedes W126, which was custom made for her by Mercedes-Benz. At the 1969 Ascot Gold Cup she invited guests to touch the sapphire on her right hand for good luck. Esquire Magazine included Sita Devi and Princie on its list of "fun couples" for 1969.
Sita Devi divorced the Gaekwad in 1956. He promptly moved to London.
Even after the dissolution of her second marriage, she clung to her exalted title. Her Rolls-Royce still sported the armorial insignia of Baroda. She would reminisce about the days when she was referred to as royalty and received 101-gun salutes. Prince Rainier awarded citizenship of Monaco to both Sita Devi and Princie. She maintained a Paris apartment as well. She continued to live in grand style, drinking Baron de Rothschild’s Bordeaux, rearranging her Louis XVI furniture and attending exclusive parties. When travelling she brought along a large wardrobe, reported to be a thousand saris, hundreds of pairs of shoes and of course her jewellery. But her finances were eventually exhausted enough for her to secretly auction some of her beloved jewels in 1974.
The Maharani suffered a tragedy in 1985, when Princie committed suicide one night when after his 40th birthday. His death was attributed to alcoholism and drug addiction. Sita Devi died four years later of natural causes. Some speculated it was due to a broken heart.

SM UB-45

SM "UB-45" was a Type UB II submarine or U-boat built for and operated by the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. "UB-45" operated in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, and was sunk by a mine in November 1916.
"UB-45" was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September. "UB-45" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an deck gun. As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service, "UB-45" was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and then launched and commissioned in May 1916.
In five patrols in her six-month career, "UB-45" sank four ships of . In early November 1916, "UB-45" was departing from the base at Varna, Bulgaria, when the U-boat struck a mine and sank rapidly. Fifteen of the twenty men on board were killed in the attack; one of the five crewmen rescued from "UB-45" later died from his injuries. "UB-45"s wreck was located and raised by the Bulgarian Navy in the 1930s with an eye toward rebuilding the submarine. Engineers from AG Weser determined that restoration of the submarine was feasible, but this was never accomplished. Remains recovered from the wreck were buried in Varna after a funeral procession through town in November 1938.
Design and construction.
The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, "U-45" could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats.
The German Imperial Navy ordered "UB-45" from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as one of a series of six UB II boats (numbered from to ). "UB-45" was long and abeam. She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draft of when surfaced. She displaced while submerged but only on the surface.
The submarine was equipped with twin diesel engines and twin electric motors—for surfaced and submerged running, respectively—that drove twin propeller shafts. "UB-45" had a surface speed of up to and could go as fast as while underwater. The U-boat could carry up to of diesel fuel, giving her a range of 6,940 nautical miles at 5 knots (12,850 km at 9.3 km/h). Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of 45 nautical miles at 4 knots (83 km at 7.4 km/h) while submerged. "UB-45" was equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The U-boat was also armed with an 8.8 cm KL/40 (3.5 in) deck gun.
"UB-45" was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 3 September 1915. As one of six U-boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction, "UB-45" was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped overland to the Austro-Hungarian port of Pola. Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola, where she was launched on 12 May 1916.
Service career.
SM "UB-45" was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 26 May 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Karl Palis. "UB-45", Palis' second U-boat command, was assigned to the Navy's Pola Flotilla (). Although the flotilla was based in Pola, the site of the main Austro-Hungarian Navy base, boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro-Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean. German U-boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs.
In mid-July, "UB-45"s first success occurred when in three days she sank two steamers. The first, "Virginia", was sunk on the 16th while carrying salt destined for Calcutta. Two men on board the 4,279-ton British ship were lost when she went down off Cape Matapan. Two days later, the French ship "Ville de Rouen" was sunk southwest of Cape Matapan. The 4,721-ton "Ville de Rouen" would be "UB-45"'s largest victim.
Germany's conquest of Romania provided the German Imperial Navy with sufficient fuel oil for submarines to operate in the Black Sea. "UB-45" and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies in the middle of 1916. "UB-45" joined the Constantinople Flotilla () on 12 August.
The German submarines in the Black Sea accomplished little, sinking only six ships between August and the end of the year; "UB-45" accounted for two of these while in the Black Sea. On 31 August, "UB-45" sank the 2,660-ton Italian steamer "Tevere" off Poti. "Tevere" had been requisitioned by the Imperial Russian Navy and was in use as a transport ship at the time. Two days later, the U-boat torpedoed the 3,701-ton "Gioconda", another Russian transport, off Trebizond. "Gioconda" was the last ship sunk by "UB-45".
At 14:30 on 6 November, "UB-45" was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian torpedo boat "Strogi" that had cleared a path through Russian mines. At what was thought to be the edge of the minefield, "UB-45" swung around "Strogi"s port side directly into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between "UB-45"s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. "UB-45" sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.
In 1932, the Bulgarian Navy conceived a plan to search for the wreck of "UB-45" with the intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel, or, at the very least, to recover the sunken U-boat's deck gun. An additional consideration was the recovery of the remains of "UB-45"s crew. On 19 July 1934, after a two-year search, Bulgarian minesweepers discovered the location of the wreck, which was resting at position , near the then Bulgarian–Romanian border. "UB-45"s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8.8-centimeter gun. The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery, after a procession through the town.
Engineers from AG Weser, "UB-45"s German builder, inspected the hulk and determined that repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, as either a training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair "UB-45". "UB-45"s deck gun was reused, however, and one of the U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship "Assen".

National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstration Study, 1991-1999

The National Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstration Study, 1991 through 1999 was set up in the United States to provide information on the achievements of the Head Start program for children living in poverty.
Background.
Head Start, initiated in 1965, provides services to low income children with the goal of mitigating disadvantages in early learning experiences. Head Start provides services (in the areas consisting of education, health, social services, and parental involvement). Head Start claims that it can help children all across the United States. The study began in 1990 when the United States Congress authorized a major program designed to enhance the early public school transitions of former Head Start children and their families. Former Head Start children, like many other children living in poverty, were at risk for poor school achievement. This new program was launched to test the value of extending comprehensive, Head Start-like supports upward through the first four years of elementary school. This project, administered by the Head Start Bureau of the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families, funded 31 local Transition Demonstration Programs in 30 states and the Navajo Nation from the 1991-1992 school year through the 1997-1998 school year and involved more than 450 public schools.
The National Transition Demonstration Study was conducted to provide information about the implementation of this program and its impact on children, families, schools and communities. More than 7,500 former Head Start children and families were enrolled in the National Study. Thousands of other children and families, however, participated in the Transition Demonstration Program, since supports and educational enhancements were offered to all children and families in the classrooms.
Organization of the data.
Family Units.
There are six family unit files. A family unit record consists of information about a child or family as the result of source data taken from family interviews, records of child test scores on a child instrument, school archival records, or teacher questionnaires (Part B). If data are available from any combination of these source documents, a family unit record is generated. A broad range of variables are included under this heading. Variables range from simple demographics to standardized scores of social skill ratings as well as neighborhood factor scores and child outcome scores in reading and mathematics. These files are associated with each year of the child's schooling (kindergarten through third grade).
School Units.
There are five school unit files, organized around the year of data collection. A school unit record consists of information about a school as the result of source data captured from family interviews, a classroom teacher, or the school principal. The structure of this data file is different from others in that rather than being merged on a common key, the records are actually stacked one upon the other in groups. The first part of the file consists of family data, the middle portion consists of teacher data, and the final portion consists of principal data. A key variable to the construction of this dataset is the REC_SRC (record source) variable. It informs the user as to the source of the data in the record. The abbreviations are "fi," "ta," and "qp" for family interview, teacher questionnaire (Part A), and questionnaire for principals, respectively. The data viewed as the centerpiece of these datasets are the school climate survey variables and their associated factor scores.
Classroom Units.
There are five classroom unit files organized around the year of data collection. The data recorded focus on the classroom and are from the following sources: classroom composition, assessment profile, a developmentally appropriate practice template, and a teacher questionnaire (Part A). Some of the data available address the social skills the teacher views as important to his or her particular classroom. Variables addressing diversity of both gender and ethnicity within a single classroom are included when available.
Exit Interviews.
There are five exit interviews. Exit information is collected from the following groups: experimental and control families, family service specialists, school principals, and classroom teachers. These exit interviews are conducted upon exit from the third grade, and have been combined for both cohorts. The community characteristics dataset is a hierarchical file having four distinct levels of data. The type of information available in this file may include data that describe the site, county, school district, or study school.

Jacksonville Film Festival

The Jacksonville Film Festival is an annual film festival held in Jacksonville, Florida. Founded in 2002, the festival screens dozens of the hundreds of films submitted for its consideration. According to the "Daily Record", the festival is "an anticipated event among the international independent film community and an economic development driver for North Florida."
History.
The festival debuted May 15-May 18 in 2003. In addition to screening films, the festival hosts panels, workshops and parties.
The Jacksonville Film Festival was conceived by Joan Monsky and Karen Sadler in the spring of 2002. They assembled a small advisory group of community leaders and arts advocates to create a mission and a template for the event which was ambitiously scheduled for May, 2003. In that same year Jacksonville Film Events d/b/a The Jacksonville Film Festival became a non-profit organization.
The Robin Shepherd Group designed the turtle logo and creative graphics, the city and the Times-Union declared their support, Preston Haskell contributed wisdom and encouragement (and more), and Erik Hart offered space and services at the Florida Theatre. Sponsors also took a leap of faith, and volunteers were generous with hours and hours of time and effort. Joan Monsky was elected president and brought in programmers to help guide the artistic vision. After long, arduous planning sessions, the First Annual Jacksonville Film Festival made its successful debut.
The mission of the Festival was threefold: to connect Jacksonville to its early “Hollywood of the South” moviemaking roots, to focus attention on independent film and filmmakers, and to contribute to the revitalization of downtown Jacksonville.
The first film shown at the Festival was The Flying Ace, made in Jacksonville in 1926 by the Norman Studios. It had been recently restored by the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center and had not been seen in 75-years. It was warmly received at a packed house at the historic Ritz Theatre.
Six downtown venues hosted films, parties and special events including the popular Entertainment Law Panel and Viva Cinema. Downtown was also alive with movie buffs, movie stars and movie guests.
Bill Murray’s appearance highlighted the second year and a film that was previewed – Napoleon Dynamite - was the season’s biggest hit. The world-wide press discovered Jacksonville and its small, fresh, new Festival.
In 2005 – 2006, the Festival became a non-profit corporation, Jacksonville Film Events, Inc. and added new initiatives: Books Alive!, a monthly program in partnership with the Jacksonville Public Library, celebrating family films derived from literature and REEL People, the film festival “fan club” offering year-round screenings of diverse and unique films never before seen in Jacksonville.
In 2007, the Jacksonville Film Festival celebrated its fifth year. The festival has been embraced by the city and is gaining increasing recognition in the Southeast as an important destination for the independent film community. A key to the success has been the festival commitment to offering “Something for Everyone!”
2008 will be known as the year of significant change. Jesse Rodriguez took the helm as Executive and program director, and along with the board of directors, extended the festival to a full week incorporating programs such as A TASTE OF ASIA, EUROPA EUROPA, HIP HOP FOR THE MASSES, as well as A MOMENT OF SILENCE PLEASE, a film program for the Deaf. The concept for a FILM FESTIVAL VILLAGE was also realized making all of the venues and hotel within walking distance of each other. Now as an international film festival, over 20 countries were represented through cinema in 2008.

Florida Winter Baseball League

The Florida Winter Baseball League, based in Miami, Florida, was a professional baseball organization located in Florida. It operated in cities around Florida.
History.
The Florida Winter Baseball League (FWBL) was a professional sports league, which began its inaugural season in October 2009. 
The FWBL was a four team league which planned to play a 60 game schedule through the winter months in various Floridian markets. It was planned to feature players from the low levels of the minors, rookie leagues and A ball. The league featured teams from Cocoa, Miami, Lake County and Seminole County.
The FWBL suspended operations on November 18, 2009 after completing 25% of its inaugural season, or 15 games. The organization did not raise all of the initial startup capital it required. The poorly run league had trouble paying the players and reports existed of player paychecks bouncing. 
A separate league, called Florida Winter League Baseball, featuring overlooked college players or released pro players is scheduled to open in January 2012. It is unclear if the leagues have any connection other than similar names.
2009-2010 Season.
The season was incomplete and interrupted after 30 games played

Modular propeller

A modular propeller is a forged propeller using complex composite materials that has replaceable parts.
Parts.
The purpose of a modular propeller is to provide more user control on boat rally speed. Each modular propeller made of composite materials has three main parts: the hub part with a front-end cap, a set of replaceable blades, and a rear joint to the shaft. The propeller blade parts assembly into slides of the hub requires not professional assistance, but desscrewing a high quality bronze to remove cone. The blade` bottom joint part of composite blades must be compatible by manufacturer design to overall license the "blade assembly" for use.
In-use performance.
Modular propellers offer boaters several advantages a fixed-pitch propeller. The ability to change blades allows boat to make adjustments in pitch for various performance needs or a change in altitude. Carrying spare blades for this purpose takes up considerably less space then carrying a complete spare propeller. The ability to replace blades also offers the advantage of replacing damaged blades while still on the water, and saves long term repair costs. Other options include adjusting pitch for altitude, water sports, cruising, and quick turnover time.
A virtualisation to render the blade pitch yawning is through car gears. Through an integer yaw pitch of 0-13 degree operating is same: low speed, and more power and acceleration by up gearing the leaver slide. The upper gear of normal cars is comparing to a propeller with a pitch angle of 17+. Good acceleration and top end speed is offered at 21 pitch. A pitch higher than 21 is dangerous because lowering shaft of gearbox back to #1 position stalls engine and blades may crack due to watter pressure. (read "lugging of engine" here!) The best estimate is that for every 2-inch pitch increase equal wide-opens thrust increase step of approximately 400 RPM. An increase in pitch will cause the rpm-gauge to drop, and an increase in pitch will raise RPM.
When changing the prop`s pitch it is important to read pictures for range of diameter propeller to engine pin and check slide conformity of blades` rotor to engine is matching.
The plastic shaft joint is supporting the blade set and further on it fits the boat by manufacturer engine design.

Jon Vislie

Jon Asbjørn Vislie (8 October 1896 – 9 February 1945) was a Norwegian lawyer who was executed during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.
He was born in Kristiania as the son of educationalist and writer Vetle Vislie and his Scanian wife Gerda, née Annerlöv. Jon Vislie married and had two children, and the family had settled in Bærum. Vislie had taken an education in law, and was a barrister with access to Supreme Court cases.
When World War II reached Norway in 1940, Vislie eventually became an economic supporter of the Norwegian resistance movement. He also helped refugees. When the Nazi police leader Karl Marthinsen was assassinated by the Norwegian resistance on 8 February 1945, Vislie was arrested together with thirty-three others, including Carl Ferdinand Gjerdrum, Haakon Sæthre and Kaare Sundby, as a reprisal. Vislie was immediately convicted by a court-martial, and executed on Akershus Fortress on 9 February. His body was lowered in the Oslofjord.

University District, Detroit

University District is a neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Located one mile west of Woodward Avenue, the University District is named for its neighbor to the south, the University of Detroit Mercy (UDM)[http://www.udmercy.edu/]. The neighborhood is bounded on the north by residential Seven Mile Road, on the south by McNichols Road and the UDM campus, and on the east by the Detroit Golf Club and Golf Club Estates. The western boundary is Livernois Avenue: once known to Detroiters as “the Avenue of Fashion,” this commercial boulevard of small shops is becoming “Gallery Row,” home to a growing collection of art galleries and art-related businesses.
Architecture.
The University District's 1,200 single family homes were built mainly during the “golden age of housing” from 1925-1930 and 1937-1941, when construction technology was highly developed, building costs were low, and old world craftsmen were in plentiful supply. The homes reflect a wide variety of styles: English Tudor, Romanesque, Italianate, Spanish Mission, French Provincial, Queen Anne, Georgian, Federalist, Art Moderne, and contemporary. The predominant Tudor style, consistent setbacks, rear-of-lot garages, and mature shade trees provide a coherent design aesthetic that gives the University District its distinctive visual identity. 
Interior features include intricate plasterwork, leaded or stained glass windows, oak paneled libraries, hand-pegged hardwood floors, one or more fireplaces, Pewabic Pottery tile, and crystal chandeliers. Most homes offer four to six bedrooms, a minimum of three bathrooms, two-car garages, and a fully finished basement that includes a furnace room, laundry room, fitness room and a large family room with wet bar and fireplace. Many of these family rooms have now been converted to home theaters. 
The District also includes two small apartment buildings and 80 duplex homes, many of which are occupied by University faculty and graduate students.
Detroit's only Frank Lloyd Wright home, the Dorothy H. Turkel House, sits just outside the District on Seven Mile Road.
Amenities and cultural resources.
Amenities in the University District include the Belden Tot Lot and Gesu Community Green and Garden. Nearby are the running track at UDM, Northwest Activities Center, the venerable Detroit Golf Club, and Palmer Park's playing fields, tennis courts, and public golf course. Cultural resources include the UDM Theatre Company in performance at Marygrove College, the Detroit Repertory Theater, and world-renowned Baker's Keyboard Lounge, as well as Sherwood Forest, Lincoln and Parkman Branch Libraries. 
Community organization.
The University District Community Association [http://www.udcaonline.com/] consists of 15 elected Board members. UDCA functions include publishing a quarterly newsletter, maintaining a website, sponsoring a volunteer radio patrol and walking tours of the neighborhood, planning social events, snowplowing non-emergency streets, and organizing support for neighborhood schools, community-wide yard sales, and biennial Home and Garden Tours. 
Surrounding communities include the Golf Club Estates, Palmer Woods, Green Acres, Sherwood Forest, Bagley Community, and Martin Park. All are part of the 12th Precinct Coalition and University Commons, umbrella organizations that address issues of area-wide interest.
The University District is a Detroit Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ), entitling home buyers to reduced property taxes for up to 15 years.
History.
The area now called the University District was originally farmland in the survey township of Greenfield, Michigan, organized by its residents in 1833 and named for its prosperous farms. A typical title abstract in the neighborhood shows a first sale by the "United States of America, Martin Van Buren, President," on April 1, 1837. The University District was annexed to the City of Detroit in the election of November 7, 1916. In November 1920, John P. McNichols, S.J., the newly appointed president of the University of Detroit, traveled with armed companions from the campus on Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit to Six Mile Road (then known as Palmer Boulevard, now called McNichols Road). He carried a satchel supposedly containing $100,000 in cash (it contained sliced newspaper—the cash was in his overcoat) to purchase the farm that is now the Main Campus of the University of Detroit Mercy. Four months later, 33 building lots along Livernois north of Palmer were sold in a three-day period. Gesu Catholic Church was soon established despite proximity to the Seven Mile and Livernois area. For several decades, the southwest quadrant of the University District was home to large Catholic families, including that of Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the first homeowners were primarily realtors, senior partners in law firms and insurance agencies, or the owners and managers of prosperous Detroit businesses. Notable residents have included business owners such as Stanley Winkleman of the Detroit department store chain bearing his name, and musicians from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Concertmaster Mischa Mischakoff entertained visiting conductors and soloists at his University District home: subsequent owners have preserved the foyer wall autographed by these artists. African-American families began moving into the University District in the 1960s, depicted on stage in "Palmer Park", a play by Joanna Glass, who lived in the neighborhood during that time.
Education.
University District is within the Detroit Public Schools district. Residents are zoned to Barbara Jordan Elementary School/Hampton Middle School for K-8, while residents are zoned to Mumford High School for high school.

Roy Carless

Roy "Roi" Carless (October 3, 1920–January 2, 2009) was a Canadian cartoonist. His cartoons were syndicated across Canada and the United States, and he is considered one of Canada's most productive cartoonists.
Biography.
Born in York County, Ontario in 1920, Roy was first published at the age of 14 in the school newspaper at Runnymede Collegiate in Toronto. His father was an athlete and Chief of Police in Swansea, where Roy explored the community between High Park and the Humber River, observing the differences between life as lived and as perceived and recorded. He said his first drawing instruction came from an architectural student who, courting Roy's older sister, needed to keep the youngster occupied with something else. Receiving no formal art training, Carless was inspired and mentored by the late Duncan Macpherson, editorial cartoonist for the Toronto Star, who nominated Carless to membership in the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists in 1971. Roy was the first labour cartoonist to be accepted by the organization.
Most of Carless' originals are now in Canada's national archives (Library and Archives Canada). Copies are also in several Presidential libraries and in university collections. His work has hung in shows in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the International Salon of Cartoons in Montreal, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Hamilton Public Library, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Civilization and the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, the National Headquarters of the Canadian Labour Council, and shows in the cities of Quebec, Paris, Boston, Washington, and the Vatican.
In 2006, Seraphim Editions published a retrospective of Roy Carless' life and work titled "the Carless Cartoon Collection, not bad for an old bastard."
Carless died Friday morning, January 2, 2009, in Hamilton, Ontario. He was 88.
Cartoons.
Signed as "Roi", Carless cartoons have been published in independent and labour publications in both official languages and in every province of Canada right to the Arctic Circle. His work has appeared in each of the United States and its territories from Guam to Puerto Rico. At his peak, Carless created for more than twenty publications with a combined circulation exceeding three million copies, drawing to meet the specific needs of each publication. Remarkably, he did this while working full-time on an assembly-line in Hamilton, Canada, and while chief steward of the union that represented employees in the plant.
"I worked with a witty bunch of guys; my editorial board was the guys at the shop," Roy said about the inspiration for much of his humour.

Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").
The village has an approximate population of 350.
History.
The village was first documented in 1295 in the "Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis" as "Chotors".
The first wooden church for the village existed before 1293. At the initiative of Anna Barbara von Gaschin, construction began in 1782 for a new church for the village. Permission was given by the Bishop of Breslau on January 31, construction began in February, and by October the building was already covered with a roof. On a ball on the decorative spire of the church is written "Franz Herzog von Gaschin, highly born, married to Anna Barbara von Garnier, decided for the greater honor of God to give money to build a new church." The document ends "This document has been placed on this ball by me, Pastor Carl Padiery, for the good of future generations. The parish celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1882 though a small exhibition of documents detailing its history collected by its then-priest, Father Kahl, who was an avid scholar.
In 1840 the village had 385 inhabitants, and a large new school was built.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 164 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 164 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. However, because citizens of Gemeinde Turawa overall voted for Germany, the village remained part of the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the village had 547 inhabitants. On 19 May 1936 the village was renamed Groß Kochen by Nazi officials because of its Slavic-sounding name. By 1939 the village had shrunk to only 474 inhabitants. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Oppeln
The village is situated near the Turawa Reservoir, which was began in 1933 with construction of the dam and then completed in 1938. During its contraction, 3 million cubic tons of earth were moved, 225 thousand tons of stone, 10 thousand tons of cement and the same amount of reinforced steel. The construction of the dam destroyed several villages, and villagers from three (Zamoscie, Krzysline, and Vorwerk Kuchara) were resettled in Groß Kottorz. However, it also brought development to the area.
After 1945, Silesia as a whole was annexed by Poland, and most of the German pollution was expelled. The village was renamed Kotórz Wielki. Though it originally placed in Silesian Voivodeship, in 1950 it was moved to Opole Voivodeship instead. On 8 March 2012, the old German name Groß Kottorz was again made official.
The town has a volunteer fire brigade, founded in 1934. It organizes may dances for the residents through the "Firemen's Club". It also organizes a traditional Silesian carnival known as "leading the bear" ("Wodzenie niedźwiedzia" in Polish, "Bährenführen" in German), through which it gets donations for maintenance. The building it is housed in is also home to the offices of the German Minority/German Cultural Association, which also holds events there.

Ligota Turawska , German Ellguth Turawa is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Turawa, within Opole County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It lies approximately north-east of Turawa and north-east of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").
The village has an approximate population of 750.
History.
The village was first mentioned in 1463, when Lord Adam Bies sold the villages of Groß Kottorz, Klein Kottorz, Kadlub, and Ellguth to Anna Schillhagen von Ottmuth for 422 marks. Both its German and Polish names derive from the medieval Slavic word "lhóta", which referred to the 5-8 year grace period after a village was founded when it did not have to pay taxes. Though Ellguth Turawa became an independent entity in 1813, it remained part of the parish of Groß Kottorz until 1891.
The village formerly had two churches. The most famous was the old "Schrotholzkirche" (wooden church) of St. Catherine that had been consecrated on November 21, 1629 by Johannes Balthasar, the Suffragan of Breslau. However, the church was destroyed in an act of arson by the Red Army in 1945. The second, present church was consecrated July 19, 1936. A Catholic school has existed in the village since the late 17th century.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921, 316 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 307 voted for annexation to the newly created state of Poland. As a result, the village stayed part of the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the village had 1014 inhabitants, and by 1939 it had grown to 1055. It received a boost to development with the construction of the Turawa Reservoir between 1933 and 1938. Until 1945 it was located in Landkreis Oppeln.
After 1945, Silesia as a whole was annexed by Poland, and most of the German pollution was expelled. The village was renamed Ligota Turawska. Though it originally placed in Silesian Voivodeship, in 1950 it was moved to Opole Voivodeship instead. On 8 March 2012, the old German name Ellguth Turawa was again made official.
The village hosts a branch of the SKGD (Sozial-Kulturelle Gesellschaft der Deutschen im Oppelner Schlesien, Social-Cultural Association of Germans in Opole Silesia).

Though it originally placed in Silesian Voivodeship, in 1950 it was moved to Opole Voivodeship instead. In 2009, the village was renamed Rzędów, and on 8 March 2012, the old German name Friedrichsfelde was again made official.
The village hosts a branch of the SKGD (Sozial-Kulturelle Gesellschaft der Deutschen im Oppelner Schlesien, Social-Cultural Association of Germans in Opole Silesia).

Turawa

Turawa is a village in Opole County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Turawa. It lies approximately north-east of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").
The village has an approximate population of 900.
History.
Though the origins of the village are not known, local legend states that the rich forests around the village were used as a hunting ground by the Dukes of Oppeln, who built a hunting lodge in the area. The first documents that mention Turawa are from the beginning of the sixteenth century, and mention two estates, both named Kuchar, belonging to the village of Groß Kottorz. One of them was Turawa, while the second was located on a site now flooded by the Turawa Reservoir. The name was probably given around 1562 by Georg von Königsfeld, the owner of the manor the settlement was located on. The settlement, along with its hamlets of Marscholken and Łyczyna continued to belong to the village of Groß Kottorz until the eighteenth century. In 1712, the settlement and the surrounding property was sold by Franz Karl von Blankovsky to Martin Scholtz von Löwencron of Kamienitz and Wieschowa, who began construction of the present palace. His son, Joseph, died childless in 1759 and his widow, Anna Barbara von Garnier, remarried Franz Adam Count von Gaschin. After her death in 1804, Turawa was owned for years by a brother, Franz Xavier von Garnier. From then until the end of World War II the village was ones by the von Garnier family, who in 1841 received the title of count (with the name Count von Garnier-Turawa.) In those times Turawa had 581 inhabitants. The last owner of turawa was Hubertus Count von Garnier-Turawa, a member of the Prussian Landtag (1925-1932), who died in 1952 in Unterwössen in Bavaria.
At the end of the nineteenth century, a chapel and cemetery were built on Bald Hill near the village, which came to be considered one of the most beautiful religious buildings in Turawa. However, after 1945 the building was systematically devastated as part of the Communist government's anti-German campaign. In 1965 the chapel was blown up, and in 1976 the ruins were removed.
In the 30's, a project came up for consideration in Oppeln for the construction of an artificial reservoir to protect the city against flooding. Hubertus von Garnier offered his own lands west of Turawa for the project. In 1933 the project was submitted to the German government, receiving the personal approval of Adolf Hitler. Construction on the 22 km² reservoir finished in 1938. As a result of the project, several small villages were flooded, and many of their citizens were relocated to Turawa.
Since 1945, after the occupation of Silesia by the Red Army and Soviet authorities, Turawa became the seat of the municipality, with its first mayor, Roch Stotko.
Palace.
Construction on the current palace in Turawa began in 1730 at the behest of Martin Scholtz von Löwenckron to plans by the Oppeln-based architect Adam Tentschert. In 1751 his son, Joseph, expanded the palace, adding a chapel with bell tower. It was again expanded in 1761 with the construction of the north wing and entrance gate. In 1847 Karl Count von Garnier completely refurbished the somewhat neglected palace. In 1937, the family von Garnier gave the palace to be used as an orphanage.After the Second World War, in 1949, the palace was given to the Children's Home of Turawa. After a fire in the offices of the district council building, it also housed temporarily the municipal offices. Between 1964-1965 the palace was remodeled to better suit the needs of the orphans. To this day, it preserves a mixture of Baroque, neo-Renaissance, and neo-Rococo architecture, including marble fireplaces, Baroque bookshelves, gilded wall deceptions and stucco, and a grand ballroom. The park surrounding the palace is filled with interesting old trees, including white oak, ash, and linden.

Kimbal Musk

Kimbal Musk (born September 20, 1972) is a South African-born Canadian and American entrepreneur, venture capitalist and environmentalist who has invested in several technology and food companies. He owns The Kitchen Cafe, LLC, a family of community restaurants located in Boulder, Fort Collins, and Denver, Colorado. 
He co-founded The Kitchen Community, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that brings outdoor vegetable gardens called "Learning Gardens" to schoolyards and community spaces. He sits on the boards of Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and the Deming Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado Boulder, The Anschutz Health and Wellness Center at the University of Colorado, Denver and Chipotle Mexican Grill. He is the younger brother of billionaire businessman Elon Musk.
Early life.
Musk grew up in an ambitious household, with his brother Elon and many cousins. For kicks, he built computers. His mother was a prominent dietician, and his father had his own engineering practice. After finishing high school in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk left to meet his mother in Toronto, Canada and enrolled in university to pursue a degree in business at Queen's University. While in school, Musk first worked at Scotiabank. He graduated with his degree from Queen's University in 1995.
Business career.
Musk's first entrepreneurship venture was a residential painting business with College Pro Painters in 1995, when he and his elder brother, Elon started their second company, Zip2. Zip2 Corporation was an online city guide that provided content for the new online versions of the New York Times and the "Chicago Tribune" newspapers. The company was sold in 1999 to Compaq for $307 million.
After selling Zip2, Musk invested in several young software and technology companies. Musk was an early investor in his brother’s venture X.com, an online financial services and email payments company. X.com changed its name to PayPal and in October 2002 was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock.
While Elon stayed in California, Kimbal moved to New York and enrolled into the French Culinary Institute in New York City. In April 2004, Musk opened The Kitchen, a community bistro in Boulder, Colorado with Jen Lewin and Hugo Matheson. The Kitchen has been named one of "America’s Top Restaurants" according to Food & Wine, Zagat’s, Gourmet, and the James Beard Foundation. 
In 2005, The Kitchen [Upstairs] opened as Boulder's Community Wine, Beer & Cocktail Lounge located directly above The Kitchen. From 2006 to 2011 Musk served as the CEO of OneRiot, an advertising network for the realtime, social web. In September 2011 Walmart-Labs acquired OneRiot for an undisclosed purchase price.
In 2011, The Kitchen [Next Door] opened as Boulder’s Community Pub and is located right next door to the west of the original restaurant on Pearl Street Mall. In 2012, The Kitchen [Denver] opened on the 16th Street Mall and expanded the restaurants' community to Denver.
In 2011, after seven years of supporting the Growe Foundation to plant school gardens in the Boulder community, Musk and Matheson established The Kitchen [Community] 501c3 nonprofit to help connect kids to real food by creating Learning Gardens in schools across America. Learning Gardens teach children an understanding of food, healthy eating, lifestyle choices and environment through lesson plans and activities that tie into existing school curriculum, such as math, science and literacy.
Each of The Kitchen restaurants donates a percentage of sales to help plant Learning Gardens in their local community. In 2012, The Kitchen Community built 26 gardens in Colorado, 16 in Chicago, and 12 more around the USA. 
In December 2012, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel handed The Kitchen Community nonprofit $1 million to install 80 gardens in Chicago city schools.

Berlin 1881 chess tournament

The "Deutscher Schachbund" (DSB, the German Chess Federation) had been founded in Leipzig on July 18, 1877. When the next meeting took place in the "Schützenhaus", Leipzig on July 15, 1879, sixty-two clubs had become members of the federation. Hofrat Dr. Rudolf von Gottschall became Chairman and Hermann Zwanzig the General Secretary. When foreign players were invited to Berlin in 1881, an important and successful formulae was completed. A master tournament was organised every second year, and Germans could partake in many groups and their talents qualified for master tournaments by a master title in the Hauptturnier. 
The Berlin 1881 chess tournament (the second DSB Congress,"2.DSB-Kongreß"), organised by Hermann Zwanzig and Emil Schallopp, took place in Berlin from August 29 to September 17, 1881. The brightest lights among the German participants were Louis Paulsen, his brother Wilfried Paulsen, and Johannes Minckwitz. Great Britain was represented by Joseph Henry Blackburne, the United States by James Mason, a master from Ireland. Mikhail Chigorin travelled from Russia, and two great masters from Poland: Szymon Winawer and Johannes Zukertort, also participated. Karl Pitschel, from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, arrived and played his games in the first three rounds, but was unable to complete the tournament. The eighteen collected masters constituted a field of strength that had not been seen since the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. The games were fiercely fought, as few draws were recorded, and a formula from this event would serve as a template for all future chess congresses in Germany before World War I. 
Masters Tournament.
The final standings and crosstable:
Hauptturnier A.
The "Haupturnier A" was won by Curt von Bardeleben, who earlier beat Berthold Lasker, Siegbert Tarrasch and Seger, in a preliminary group.
The final results:
1. Bardeleben 2½/3 (won a preliminary group, scoring 3/3)
2. Specht 2/3 (won a prel. group, scoring 2/3)
3. Kist 1½/3 (won a prel. group, scoring 2/2)
4. Reif 0/3 (won a prel. group, scoring 2/3)

Readahead

readahead is the file prefetching technology used in the Linux operating system. It is a system call that loads a file's contents into the page cache. When a file is subsequently accessed, its contents are read from physical memory rather than from disk, which is much faster.
Many distributions of Linux use readahead on a list of commonly used files to speed up booting. In such a setup, if the kernel is booted with the "profile" parameter, it will record all file accesses during bootup and write a new list of files to be read before booting. This will make additional installed services start faster, because they are not included in the default readahead list.
For Linux distributions which are using systemd, readahead is replaced by systemd-readahead.

Góreczno

Góreczno (German: Bergvorwerk) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Głogówek (Gemeinde Oberglogau), within Prudnik County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, close to the Czech border. It lies approximately south of Głogówek (Glogow), east of Prudnik, and south of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). However, though most of the area is now bilingual in German and Polish, this village is not because its population of German speakers was thoroughly eliminated after WWII.
History.
The name of this village derived from its location; until 1945 it was called '"Bergvorwerk", meaning "estate on the mountain". The owners of the estate, amounting to 1000 hectares of arable land, were the von Gaffron-Prittwitz family, descendants of Hussars rewarded by Frederick the Great of Prussia for their loyalty with a large fief. After the death of the last member of the family, Alexander Friedrich von Gaffron-Prittwitz (1845-1923), his widow sold the estate, along with one in nearby Kasimir. The land was then parceled out into a dozen large farms, including one belonging to Alois Dambon of nearby Roschowitzwald. In the 1930s a waterworks for Oberglogau was built in the town. There is also a Neolithic archeological site in the town.
After 1945, when Silesia was given to Poland, the town was renamed Stroków, and then renamed again to Góreczno.

History.
The first mention of the town dates back to 1217, when its name was Lesnie. The town is next mentioned in 1388, when Prince Wladislaw of Oppeln founded a Pauline monastery in the nearby village of Mochau. The area eventually came under the control of Austria, but was taken by the kingdom of Prussia in the 18th century. In 1850 the village was assigned to the parish of Mochau.
Until 1900 the village operated a distillery, and a watermill was functional until it was destroyed in a flood in 1903. In the village there are two chapels; one dedicated to Saint Urban I and another built to commemorate the plague of 1649. There are also four crosses in the village, erected in 1899, 1906, 1913, and 1954.

Receptorome

The receptorome is a concept analogue to the genome and proteome but also to other sets of structural or functional units such as the proteasome and connectome.
In analogy with the genome, where the genome is the total set of genes, the receptorome can be considered the total set of genes giving rise to receptors or receptor molecules. It could also be seen as the total number of receptor proteins in a certain organism.
The human receptorome constitutes at least 5% of the human genome. It encodes receptors that mediate the physiological, pathological and therapeutic responses to both exogenous and endogenous ligands. 
Several in silico (on a chip) and physical screening methods have been devised to mine the receptorome efficiently and "mass-screening" substances towards a huge set of receptors to study effect and interaction. 
In practice, the receptorome now is considered to encompass not only traditional receptors but also ion channels and transporters in the human genome that are potential drug targets. Some of the most renowned types are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) - targets for many medications.
One of the most active areas of search for ligands to receptors, are in the field of brain receptors. In the hunt for psychopharmacologically active substances, psychoactive plant products are screened towards a receptorome array. Apart from finding new substances, discovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for these substances' actions will likely give insights into the molecular underpinnings of human consciousness. 
An article on screening the GPCR-receptorome is: "Mining the Receptorome".[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/short/280/7/5129]

Carl Niehaus

Carl Niehaus (born 25 December 1959) is the former spokesman for South African ruling party the African National Congress, former spokesman for Nelson Mandela, and was a political prisoner after being convicted of treason against South Africa. He stepped down as ANC spokesman in February 2009 after admitting to maladministration of his own finances, extensive borrowing from political contacts and possible fraud.
Treason conviction and sentence.
As a young theology student Niehaus was reported to the security police by his flatmate after speaking incautiously about blowing up the gasworks in Johannesburg. In 1983 he was convicted of treason and received a prison sentence of 15 years. He was released in the 1990.
In 2008 he publicly disclosed that he was gang raped in prison the night before his guilty verdict was handed down. The truth of this claim has subsequently been questioned by a former friend, Bart Luirink, editor of the Dutch Zuidelijk Afrika Magazine
Education.
In February 2008 investigations by a number of media organisations found that Niehaus had falsely claimed to hold a masters degree and a doctorate in theology from the University of Utrecht. Claimed qualifications confirmed to be true included a Bachelor's in Theology from the University of South Africa (Unisa) awarded in April 1988 and an honours degree (Cum Laude) from the same institution two years later. Niehaus was awarded the "international medal" of the University of Utrecht in 2000. This medal is granted to persons who have contributed to the international profile of Utrecht University in an exceptional way.
Career.
In 1994 he became the spokesman for Nelson Mandela and, subsequently, a member of parliament and the chairman of the correctional services committee.
In late 1996 he was appointed South Africa's ambassador to the Netherlands.
At the end of his term as ambassador he became an executive director of Nicro, the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders.
In late 2000 he became the joint chairman of the "Home for all" initiative, a campaign by white activists to apologise for apartheid.
2009 scandal.
In February 2009 Niehaus stepped down as spokesman for the ANC after a newspaper reported on a "broad trail of bad debt and broken promises" stemming from his personal financial mismanagement, including one instance of possible fraud. Niehaus confessed to most of the allegations against him in the same article.
Parts of his confession were questioned on the same day, when the Gauteng provincial government said it had independently discovered that Niehaus had forged the signatures of provincial ministers to secure a loan. Niehaus claimed he had confessed the forgery within hours of committing it.
Niehaus stepped down as spokesman of the ANC the same day in what the party described as a mutual decision.

Beverly Eckert

Beverly Eckert (May 29, 1951 – February 12, 2009) was an activist and advocate for the creation of the 9/11 Commission. She was one of the members of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee for the 9/11 Commission. Eckert's husband, Sean Rooney, died at age 50 in the attacks of September 11, 2001. She pushed for a commission to investigate 9/11 and to establish a memorial.
Eckert died at age 57 on February 12, 2009, in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in Clarence Center, New York. She had met with President Barack Obama just a few days before her death in her role as an advocate for those affected by 9/11.
Before the September 11 attack.
Eckert was born in 1951 in Buffalo, New York, and met her future husband, Sean P. Rooney, at a dance at Canisius High School, a Jesuit-run academy in that city, when both were 16 years old. Eckert attended the Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls high school in Eggertsville, New York. She received a degree in fine arts in 1975 from Buffalo State College, where in 2005 she gave the Baccalaureate Commencement Address. Rooney lived in Buffalo until 1978, working as a manager of restaurants, until he began working in the financial services industry and moving to Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut. When he died he was a vice president for risk management services at the Aon Corporation. He worked on the 98th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, one of 32 employees in Aon's offices there.
The couple, who had no children and lived in the Glenbrook section of Stamford, Connecticut, had been married 21 years when Rooney died. Before Rooney's death, they had celebrated their 50th birthdays with vacations to Vermont, to mark his, and Morocco, to mark hers.
September 11, 2001.
When the planes hit the World Trade Center, Rooney called his wife and exchanged voice mail messages with her. To get to safety, he made his way to the 105th floor of his building, trying to reach the roof, when he became trapped until the tower collapsed, killing him.
After Eckert learned about the attacks, she went home and stayed on the phone with her husband until she heard the tower collapse. She described the incident in a StoryCorps interview.
After September 11.
Eckert became a leading activist among 9/11 victims' families, joining with others in lobbying for creation of the 9/11 Commission, improvements to national security, and for creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. In pressing federal elected officials to do a better job in protecting Americans from terrorism, she was among a number of 9/11 victims' family members active in pressing for sweeping reforms of U.S. intelligence. She also spoke in opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Eckert was the co-chairperson of the group Voices of September 11.
Locally, Eckert worked with Stamford city officials on various memorial projects. She left her job at General Re and volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and, beginning in September 2008, as a tutor at the Julia A. Stark Elementary School. She was also a member of the Glenbrook Neighborhood Association. In honor of her husband and other victims, Eckert planted birch trees near a trail in Cove Island Park where she and Rooney learned to in-line skate. At the Glenbrook train station, where her husband commuted to work, she commissioned a mural and planted a sycamore tree as a memorial. Shortly before her death, she joined a neighborhood association committee to improve the station.
Death.
Eckert was killed on February 12, 2009, in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 outside of Buffalo, New York. She was traveling to Buffalo for a gathering with her family to mark what would have been Rooney's 58th birthday on February 15. A ceremony had also been scheduled at Canisius High School in which she was to award a student with a memorial scholarship in Rooney's honor.
A week before her death, Eckert met with U.S. President Barack Obama, to discuss detainees at Guantanamo and other matters. In a press conference after her death, Obama described her as a "tireless advocate for the families, those whose lives were forever changed on that September day."
On June 18, 2009, Margaux Eckert, executrix of her sister's estate, filed a lawsuit in New Haven, Connecticut, against Colgan Air, Pinnacle Air and Continental Airlines, claiming they were responsible for the crash.

Alliance Girls High School

Alliance Girls' High School is a national girls' boarding school located near the small town of Kikuyu in the Kiambu District of the Central Province of Kenya, 20 km from Nairobi. It is within walking distance from its brother school Alliance High School. 
History.
Founded in 1948 by the Alliance of Protestant Missions, Alliance Girls' High School was the first institution of higher education for African girls in Kenya, and served in parallel lieu to Kenya High School that then only admitted European girls. Before independence it was called African Girls High School. Alliance Girls High School sits on 71 acres of land in Kiambu West district, Central Province.
The first 10 girls admitted to the school arrived on 28 February 1948. These girls were drawn from the all the different provinces in Kenya. This national outlook has been retained to-date. It has since been a pioneer of African education and is held as a vanguard academic elite and maintains close relations with its brother school, Alliance High School
Admission
Admission is highly competitive. Only students who have impeccably done well at the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education are selected to attend. The school partakes of the national quota system that sees a balance in admission of students from all Kenyan Districts.
Academic Reputation
Alliance Girls' High School prides in its academic prowess. It maintains a top 10 position in the KCSE yearly. In 2011, the school emerged the 2nd National school, only after the Alliance High School, and 5th nationally.
All students go on to top Kenyan Universities as well as reputed international universities. The school supports applications to colleges in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa among others. Similarly, a couple of it' students are annually selected to the African Leadership Academy; a highly selective leadership program through the entire continent.
AGHS crest.
The crest is composed of a yellow flaming torch superimposed over St. Andrew's Cross on a green background. The initials AGHS are above the crest, while the school motto 'Walk in the light" is underneath, both written in yellow.
The colour yellow represents the Light of the torch, while the green colour depicts the life given by the Light. The white colour speaks of the product of this life. The school uniform is green. Green is life which signifies growth of the school.
Principals.
The school chapel, one of the landmarks of the school, is located opposite the Administration block. It is used for services on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. It is also where the school Barazas are held. The school chaplain is Reverend Marion Strain until Reverend Dorcas Kamau took over in 2011.
School life.
The school has five streams in each form and the girls are accommodated in ten houses:
Learning facilities include;
In the music room students can practice on traditional instruments such as triangle, shakers, drums, xylophone and chivoti, and modern instruments like recorder, piano, drum set, guitar and violin.
Alliance High School
Ever since its foundation as the African Girls High School in 1948, the School maintains close relations with its brother school, The Alliance High school. They interact both academically and socially. Each of the 9 houses at the Alliance Girls' High School have a corresponding brother house at Alliance High School. The social interaction is aimed at grooming and finishing of the girls and boys. In this, houses usually participate in termly get together pre- or post- Valentine's Day event called 'Socials' and the much more anticipated bi- termly joint movies. Mail correspondence between the two schools is also provided free of charge daily for both schools.
Religious Activities
The school is embedded in strong Christian principles with the PCEA as it church sponsor. Grace before partaking any meal, there's compulsory chapel service on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and Christian Religious Education is compulsory for the first two years of high school. However, different religions are respected and supported by the administration. A priest comes in to say mass every Sunday, and other days upon request. The Muslim students have a Prayer room and are at liberty to practice their faith. In addition, they conngregate with their male counterparts at the Alliance High School's Carey Francis Memorial Lecture Theater. There is also a joint Easter Service and vigil Christmas Carol service held in the school chapel annually.
Clubs and Societies
The school lay strong emphasis towards extra- curricular involvement. A minimum of three clubs is required once enrolled; an academic club, a non- academic club and a sport. The school offers several clubs, some of which are;
"Academic"

Student Administration
Along with teachers, the schools employs student captains, a very prestigious title, to aid in administration. Similarly, is a school baraza, the student council, in which the students get to openly and directly share their opinions with the school principal.
Physical fitness is enhanced through activities like jogging, aerobics and other school sports.
The guidance and counselling department holds talks, seminars, and workshops.
A nurse is available to attend to medical cases, in a sanatorium. She is on call 24 hours and so can attend to emergency cases.
School song.
The school song was composed by an 'A' level student, Mary Dena in 1985. This was after the poor examination results which depressed AGHS. The song was meant to stimulate and inspire the girls to continue working as a team to revive their lost glory. The school song is usually sung at the beginning and end of every school term as a constant reminder to all gathered of the comradeship at AGHS.
School Baraza.
This is a forum where the students discuss issues affecting their school-life, mainly involving airing grievances to the school principal. The principal in return addresses the raised issues and gives a report to the students at the next baraza. The baraza serves as a link between the students and the school administration.
Exchange programme.
Alliance Girls' High School has an exchange programme with Brooks School in Massachusetts, USA. First priority is given to meritorious students. The students are selected by a panel of teachers. They then fly over during the April holidays. Their 2-month stay is facilitated by a selected family. The students also have better opportunities to study in universities in Kenya and abroad.
Another exchange program with a school in the United Kingdom, Sir John Leman High School. Three students from Alliance Girls' and three from Alliance High School plus six students from the Port Reitz school in Mombasa take part in this exchange every three years.

Blue skies research

Blue skies research (also called blue sky science) is scientific research in domains where "real-world" applications are not immediately apparent. It has been defined as "research without a clear goal" and "curiosity-driven science." It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term "basic research." Proponents of this mode of science argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in genetics and stem cell biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope. Because of the inherently uncertain return on investment, blue-sky projects are politically and commercially unpopular and tend to lose funding to more reliably profitable or practical research. The specific name "blue skies" to describe this kind of research is mainly used in Great Britain.
History.
Support for blue skies research has varied over time, ultimately becoming the subject to the political process, in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Vannevar Bush's 1945 report, "Science: The Endless Frontier", made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research. The 1957 launch of Sputnik prompted the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research to sponsor blue skies research into the 1960s. By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the Netherlands, and by the 1990s in Germany and the United States.
In 1980, British Petroleum (known as BP after 2000) established a blue skies research initiative called the Venture Research Unit, headed by particle physicist Donald Braben. Braben controversially challenged peer review as the mechanism for establishing funding, emphasizing the selection of researchers whose proposals "could radically change the way we think about something important."
In 2005, Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust and former Professor of Medicine at Imperial College, London warned that excessive emphasis on agenda-driven research could jeopardise serendipitous advances in science:
The Government is right to recognise the important of science and technology, but I think it is a mistake to try to ring-fence funds. There is a serious danger that we will spend money on projects that are less good. It is absolutely key that funding is used to support the best scientists with the best ideas.
When UK research councils introduced a requirement that grant application include a 2-page statement on the economic impact of the proposed work, 20 scientists, including 1996 Nobel laureate Harold Kroto, wrote a public letter to "Times Higher Education" condemning the requirement and calling for peer reviewers to ignore the additional documentation.
Grants and conferences.
The Royal Society grants up to 1 million pounds sterling annually in "Theo Murphy Blue Skies awards" to fund "research which is considered to be original and exciting but lacks a sufficient evidence base in the literature to be supported by traditional grant schemes."
The UK-based Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) operates a program called the IDEAS Factory, intended to promote "blue sky, curiosity-led research."
The international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) holds a "Blue Sky Forum" every decade.
Subjects.
Owing to its radical nature, blue sky science may challenge accepted scientific paradigms and introduce entirely new fields of study. It has been the inspiration for numerous works of science fiction. It has sometimes been concerned with topics such as unexplained phenomena and the impact of future technologies upon society, asking questions such as "How would a spacecraft traverse a black hole and where would it arrive upon leaving it?" and "Will the universe end, or will it just expand ever outwards for eternity?"

Franklin Wesson House

The Franklin Wesson House is an historic house at 8 Claremont Street in the Main South neighborhood of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is one of the finest High Gothic Victorian houses in the city. The 2.5 story brick structure was built in 1874 for Franklin Wesson, one of the founders of Harrington & Richardson, a major Worcester arms manufacturer. It is roughly rectangular in form, but has a number of protrusions, most notably a three story tower over its entrance that is capped by a steeply pitched slate hip roof. The body of the house is also topped by a hip roof with a major bay on the right side whose steeply pitched roof rises to its own peak. The windows of the house are predominantly narrower with rounded tops, and there are horizontal bands of decorative brickwork at several levels.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Jack V. Lunzer

Jack V. Lunzer (born in 1924) is a retired industrial diamond merchant and the creator and custodian of the Valmadonna Trust Library.
Biography.
Jack Valmadonna Lunzer was born in Antwerp in 1924, where his British father was working as a diamond dealer for De Beers. He is related to the scholar Liepman Philip Prins (1835-1915), and his grandfather, Julius, was the founding president of the Adath Yisroel Synagogue in London. He moved to London as a child, where he was educated, and worked during World War II in a Spitfire engine factory making diamond tools. He began to work under his father but disliked working for De Beers, so he established his own firm, Industrial Diamond Company, exploiting the niche market for industrial diamonds, took over his father's dealer business in 1949 and later expanded into mining. By the 1980s, his company had annual sales of $100 million. In 1948, Lunzer married Ruth Zippel, the Italian-born daughter of a Polish merchant. Her father had a collection of Hebrew books that she and Lunzer took to London. Lunzer has five adult daughters: Margaret, Myra, Fiona, Alison and Caroline. Ruth Lunzer died in 1978. The daughters are the beneficiaries of the Valmadonna Trust.
Lunzer began investing in racehorses, but by the 1950s, he had turned to collecting rare Hebrew books. Over the next six decades, he created the collection of 13,000 books and manuscripts held by the Valmadonna Trust Library. It is named after Valmadonna, a small town near Alessandria in north-west Italy where Lunzer's friends lived and his wife’s family had ties. By purchasing the deed to the town, Lunzer became the Count of Valmadonna. The collection encompasses works from throughout the world, particularly Italy, where Hebrew printing began, and covers four and a half centuries of typography. Many items in the collection are rare or unique, among them some of the earliest Hebrew printed books. The collection was exhibited in February 2009 by Sotheby's, which continues to seek a buyer. After visiting the exhibition of the collection at Sotheby's, a scholar from the Drisha Institute wrote of Lunzer's achievement:
The morning of our visit, I studied the commentary of Rabbi David Kimhi, who is known as the Radak, on Joseph's conflict with his brothers. Honestly, it felt like just another of the many rabbinic commentaries... Then I went to the Valmadonna. Peering closely at one of the oldest manuscripts, I saw that it was a volume of Psalms with the Radak's commentary. In that instant, time and space collapsed as I found myself bound to every other Jew who has studied Kimhi's work since it was penned in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. That moment made clear to me that I am not simply a modern Jew studying in a contemporary yeshiva near Lincoln Center. I am tied to every other Jew through 800 years of history. I envision Kimhi hunched over his work, and wonder if his soul knows that even still we are learning from him, that his elucidation remains as relevant to the study of biblical text as it was to his contemporaries. The books of the Valmadonna – the books of our people – bring history alive keep our history alive even when the communities that produce them are long dead.
Lunzer lives in Golders Green, London, where he had held the collection in his home. Since 1982, the librarian for the collection has been Mrs Pauline Malkiel.

Democracy and Desire

Democracy and Desire (also "Democracia y Deseo") is an evolutionary exhibition project by artist Per Hüttner that develops as it travels. It has been shown in various public and private venues in Europe since November 2006. The project takes its inspiration from Zen Buddhist Koans by pairing the incompatible words democracy and desire. The project investigates how the intellectual freedom of the mind is connected to, inhibited by social order and how the human body can both support and undermine the search for mental and social liberty through social interaction.
Structure.
The project uses different forms of interactions with the public to change as it travels, drawing on Hüttner's previous experiences with exhibitions like I am a Curator”. In the preparatory research for the project, the artist was collaborating with a group of young creators called "The Mob" working within the framework of visual art research network Vision Forum. They set up an interactive website to collect material from the public and a wide variety of audiences. The website has since been closed, but much of the material that was gathered, is available in the catalogue that was published in conjunction with the second incarnation of the exhibition project.
The First Public Incarnation.
On November 23, 2006 the first version of "Democracy and Desire" opened to the public at the gallery "Vacio 9" in Madrid, Spain. The exhibition consisted solely of photographic work by Hüttner. But throughout the run of the exhibition, "The Mob" organized various public events that were open for audience participation; a night of performances with local and international artists like Julio Jara, Antonio Arean, Nuria Mora, Anita Wernström, Jean-François Robardet and Marie Husson; video screenings with video art from around the globe and various semi-private training programs particularly related to gender issues.
The photographic work, that was also the point of departure for the public events, was clearly inspired by the life and work by Francisco Goya both in expression and in content. Hüttner used the contradictory relationship between political powers and private desires that can be seen in many of the great master's paintings and created images that investigated the relationship between us as individual human beings and the interacting systems that surrounds us. In a text dedicated to the exhibition it is stated":
" Some images in the series depict the traces of great despots’ megalomania or locations where books have been burned and innocent people have been killed. All the same, these places have witnessed marriages being consumed and great loves being born. Democracy and Desire acknowledges that the system is not the same as the people who perpetuate it. It asks to what degree our lives change when the political system changes and who are the people responsible for these changes? More importantly, however, it asks to what degree the system changes when the people within it change? When you grow as a human being, what does that mean for the powers in your town, city or country?"
The quote shows how clearly the artist is influenced by Deleuze’s assemblage theory and its impact on social ontology. The relationship between individuals and social structure in the and public space in Hüttner's earlier work became the impetus for Democracy and Desire. French writer Laurent Devèze has written about the 2006 exhibition "Repetitive Time" and the constant re-negotiation between the two becomes evident.:
"Little by little, by stopping us running around even for a short moment in time, we are forced to think about the past. Or rather to reflect on the whole paradigm of a memorial: an object built in a space specifically to remind us of something that happened at a moment in time. It is this that gives your [Hüttner's] altars such a strange intensity. They hold no indication to help us understand what they represent. Was a man killed here? Did something strange or extravagant take place here, something interesting enough to be remembered? The question is pertinent because, in our old cities overburdened with history, it is very likely that any and every point could be marked: here, a man died; here, a traffic accident occurred; here, a divorce was maybe agreed or a marriage proposal was accepted or some secret love affair was begun. It is a vertiginous thought: every point in the spaces that surround us has to be remembered; they are all worthy of it. There is not a single inch in the urban landscape that, if looked at through the prism of the past, should not be remembered. Which means that we could easily be surrounded by innumerable memorials, since everywhere we turn, something happened, something essential to someone.
This goes hand in hand with Manuel DeLanda's definition of the assemblage:
The Second Exhibition.
In November 2007 the second version of "Democracy and Desire" opened at the "Romanian Cultural Institute" in Stockholm, Sweden and included public talks and discussions. For the exhibition the artist had created a series of drawings that were specially made to accompany each photograph. The work on paper underlined the search for personal freedom of the mind in spite of social conventions by focusing on how imagination, sexuality and creativity can liberate human beings. The work is greatly influenced by Soviet/Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin:
“What is the character of these ornaments? They impressed the connoisseurs by the extremely fanciful, free and playful treatment of plant, animal and human forms. These forms seemed interwoven as if given birth to each other. The borderlines that divide the kingdoms of nature in the normal world were boldly infringed. Neither was there the usual static presentation of reality. There was no longer the movement of finished forms, vegetable or animal, in a finished and stable world; instead the inner movement of being itself was expressed in the passing of one form into the other, in the ever incompleted character of being. This ornamental interplay revealed an extreme lightness and freedom of artistic fantasy, a gay, almost laughing, libertinage.”
The drawings presupposes a kind of timeless Carnival where the social roles were turned upside down. The work and also suggests, just like Bakhtin writes that the whole paradigm of temporality needs to be reformulated for humans to achieve freedom. But the images also connected back to Goya's work. Human violence was introduced as possible and darker form of liberator and thus raising issues of the relationship between victim and perpetrator. The artist writes in the catalogue":
" We cannot continue to ignore the presence of our violent drives. Culture, conscience, and rationality cannot suppress the violence that is inscribed into our genes. Marlon Brando’s rendering of Colonel Kurtz in "Apocalypse Now" virtually incorporates all these principles or at least what can happen in an extreme situation when they have been repressed for too long. The final section of the film, which you might describe as a contemporary filmic paraphrase on Goya’s "Disasters of War" is an incredibly forceful investigation to humanity’s relationship to violence. Kurtz is a violent madman and is on the one hand so appealing and on the other incredibly repulsive. His acceptance of his violent drives approaches or embraces insanity. He asks Willard, the man who will shortly kill him, 'Have you ever considered any real freedoms, freedoms from the opinion of others, even the opinions of yourself?' Those are crucial words from one ruthless warrior to another – but even more so for the artist. If the artist is not liberated from his or her inhibitions, it is also impossible for the audience to live a moment of freedom, since the humanness of the artist is veiled by doubts."
Hüttner invited a group of young Swedish artists to create performances, film screenings and discussions to go along with the installation. After two months of preparations, the group declined the offer and opted to create a parallel exhibition at with the same title at Museet för Glömska (The museum of Forgetting) in the neighbouring town of Norrköping. The exhibition's curator, Giorgiana Zachia responded by arranging a series of discussions at the gallery that included the artist and fellow curator Niclas Östlind.
Another Format of Democracy and Desire.
For "Nothing to declare, 4th. Oberschwaben Contemporary Art Triennial" in Friedrichshafen in Germany, English Curator Barnaby Drabble asked the artist to develop the themes from "Democracy and Desire’s" second incarnation. The artist responded to this invitation by creating an installation using photos from the project along with new drawings. The photographs dialogue with the large mural drawings, further underlined the contradictions between the private and public realities depicted. They filtered out the individual's alienation to its own surroundings and the cultural clashes that we are faced with in contemporary life. The curator writes":
" In many of the works the artist appears to stage his own ‘otherness’ proposing the modern city and the thinking behind modernism, as the backdrop against which this theatre of alienation is being played out."
In keeping with the conceptual foundation for the project, he created drawings that worked like contemporary, western shanshui paintings underlining the artist's interest in issues of alienation and inclusion. Trees drawn in the ink of modern, urban graffiti were metamorphosing into aeroplanes and then back into a wooden ladders in a stand-still morphing of traditional eastern art. The trees, connected to the mountains, paths and rivers depicted in the photographs. The clear references to traditional Chinese painting underlines the fact that Hüttner's focus never strays far from the human mind and how philosophy shapes the formulation of our reality.
The 2008-09 Presentation.
The relationship to Zen koans was developed in the third version of the project at "Abecita Konstmuseum" in Borås. Here Hüttner returned to taking inspiration from contemporary ideas in mathematics and physics. He did so in a very free and creative way, just like he had done in his work from the early 1990s. By mixing theories from contemporary science with reflections on the life quality of our existence, he delved deeper into paradox and the possibility to develop sense from the absurd. Hüttner imagined alternative pasts and through that alternative futures for democracy and desire in a mural painting. Poetic texts were connected to a band of monchrome colour fields that went around the circumference of the museum. Examples from the short texts include: "The Democracy of Orgasm Act is enforced (Europe and Asia 2058-2122 AD)" and "A few hunters and gatherers discuss why their alpha male is such an idiot (Europe 8314 BC)." The visual impression of the work was very scientific and rational. But the content was filled with absurd and paradoxical suggestions related to potential future and past events related to democracy and desire respectively. The mural dialogued with the drawings and photographs and raised questions about time and temporality's role in paradoxes.
Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy/Behavior Workshop for Idiots.
In May and June 2009 Lillian Fellman, director of Kunsthalle Luzern organized “Behavior Workshop for Idiots” and the exhibition “Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy”. For the latter Hüttner showed a new version of “Some Other Histories of Democracy and Desire” where the texts had been both developed and translated into German. The approach to Zen Koans in this form was much less austere. The content was pushed towards a more blatant idiocy, humour and with a further shift to the carnivalesque and holding back the mysterious and nonsensical approach of the Buddhists. The contrast between the cool appearance of the installation and absurd content of the texts shows that the artist takes a more positive and proactive approach to the issues at hand. He moves further in the research to see how contemporary science and its outlook on temporality can be used to inspire life and art.
The artists and curators: Fatos Ustek, Hristina Ivanoska, Yane Calovski, Mari Brellochs, Albert Heta, Sixten Kai Nielsen and Martin Rosengaard, participated in the workshop which dealt with many of the issues treated in the previous incarnations of Democracy and Desire. Hüttner also arranged a collaborative performance with the other participants. They were each given a copy of the catalogue of the exhibition and were asked to find alternative ways to read the catalogue while traversing the town and then climbing a mountain. Each participant found a different way to approach the task. Mari Brellochs for instance cut the entire catalogue into heart-shaped messages and gave them to people and left them in strategically chosen places in nature.
La Caméra horloge, 2012.
Within the framework of the Nordic festival Les Boréales in Normandy in France, Per Hüttner showed a new incarnation of the project at Le Radar in Bayeux. The exhibition brought together a large number of the original photographs with more recent video work thus moving the focus to temporality like the title suggests (The Timekeeping Camera). In the press release the curator underlines that the core questions of Democracy and Desire remain and yet find that they are reformulated with more focus on time.
"While destabilizing the eye, the artist opens for other interpretations when he compares the title of the exhibition to a Koan, a deliberately confusing formula for the enlightenment of Zen monks. The observer is invited to take on a challenge, to move beyond appearances to reach a deeper awareness of the world by means of exploring the photographs on display. Per Hüttner voluntarily invites the visitor to update his or her subjectivity by discovering the conditions of any perception of reality. Time and space become measurement standards that allow the personal to aid to appreciate the beauty of the changing the world around them. Yet his photographs reveal the fleetingness and infinite in paradox. Intuition, feelings and reason coexist, but not without friction. Indeed his photographs raise questions of enigmatic and spiritual nature while at the same time investigating scientific concepts such as space-time continuum and quantum physics."
Publication.
A catalogue with the title "Per Hüttner: Democracy and Desire" designed by international design group "Åbäke" was published in 2007. It uses the special typeface developed by Thomas Moore for his "Utopia" on the cover as well in the pages of the book.". Which was developed from a collaboration with Dent-de-Leone and Aurélien Froment where the entire 1516 novel is set in the typeface developed by Moore and thus virtually impossible to read.

Moate railway station

Moate railway station is a former railway station serving the town of Moate in County Westmeath. The station was located on the Midland Great Western Railway's branch line to Galway, and opened in 1851. The station formed part of the main route between Dublin, County Galway and County Mayo until 1973, when Córas Iompair Éireann decided to transfer the majority of these services to the Great Southern and Western Railway route from Portarlington. At this point, services were cut back until finally the station was closed in 1987, severing the rail link between Athlone and Mullingar.
Since 1987, Moate has been cut off from the railway network. The development of the Irish economy in the 1990s and 2000s has led to a re-evaluation of the need for an extended railway network. The Irish government's Transport 21 plan has seen several major rail expansion projects implemented, which will restore several areas to the network after many years. However, the line from Mullingar to Athlone via Moate is not included in these proposals, in spite of the Strategic Rail Review which led to the Transport 21 proposals recommending that it be reopened. This has led to criticism from the local community, and calls for Iarnród Éireann to rethink this, as part of attempts to improve the rail infrastructure in the Midlands. In particular, the Midland Railway Action Group sees the reopening of the rail link as vital to the expansion of the economy of the "Midland Gateway", as it would provide a faster service from Galway into central Dublin than at present.

The Vendome and the St. Ives

The Vendome and the St. Ives are a pair of historic residential apartment houses at 17-19 and 21-23 Chandler Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Vendome (17-19 Chandler) was built in 1898 by Judson W. Hall to a design by the noted local architectural firm of Barker & Nourse, on property where Hall previously had a house. The five story building is primarily faced in Roman brick, with pressed metal bay windows, sandstone lintels, and decorative sandstone panels. The St. Ives (21-23 Chandler) was built c. 1913, also for Hall. It is stylistically similar to its neighbor, but is slightly wider, possessing two central window bays where The Vendome has one.
The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Surin, Thailand

Surin is a town in Thailand, capital of Surin province. It is the site of the annual Surin Elephant Round-up. As of 2000, Surin had a population of 41,582. 
Etymology.
The first syllable "Sur-" originates from the Sanskrit word "Sura" (Devanagari: सुर) meaning "God" (cf. Asura), and the word "In-tar" from Sanskrit is "Indra" (Devanagari: इन्द्र). Hence the name of the province literally means "Lord Indra".
Geography.
In the north of the province is the valley of the Mun river, a tributary of the Mekong. To the south of the province is the Dongrek mountain chain, which also forms the boundary to Cambodia. The central and northern parts of the province are undulating flood plains.
Climate.
Surin has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification "Aw"). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from late April through eary October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.
History.
Prehistory.
The earliest settlers in this region were hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic, with the introduction of agriculture, dates from 2,500 to 1,500 years BCE. The Bronze Age dates from 1,500-500 BCE, and the Iron Age from 500 BCE to 500 CE. It is in the Iron Age that the first evidence of human settlement emerges in the province, with approximately sixty known Iron Age sites.
Historical period.
The earliest known historical period is the Dvaravati. This was an Indian based culture, which diffused through the north-east region of what is now Thailand. Evidence of this culture is found in Surin region dating to between the 7th to 11th centuries CE. It was in this period that Buddhism became the dominant religion of the region.
Following the Dvaravati period, the powerful Khmer Empire expanded its influence throughout what is now the southern Isan region of Thailand. This period covers the 7th to 13th centuries CE. Surin was an important part of the ancient Khmer empire. Temple ruins and a substantial ethnic Khmer minority remain part of Surin. Khmer stone inscriptions date from c. 600 CE. Over the next several centuries a growing number of Khmer sites were constructed in the province, most notably Prasat Sikhoraphum. These sites would have formed part of the network of Khmer infrastructure centred on Prasat Phanom Rung. 
With the collapse of the Khmer empire in the 13th century Surin province faded from history. It is in the 18th century that it re-emerges. At this time a Kuay local leader named Chiangpum became the royally appointed ruler of the region. According to legend he presented a rare white elephant to the Chao Phaya Chakri, future King Rama I. In gratitude, Chiangpum was awarded the royal title "Luang Surin Phakdi" and appointed the village headman. When Rama I became the Thai monarch, he appointed Luang Surin Phakdi as the province's governor. In 1763 the village was moved to the location of the modern city of Surin, and was upgraded to a city with the name "Muang Prathai Saman". There is a local legend that this move was due to better water supplies at the new site. Also, that the original location of the town was at Muang Thi, approximately fifthteen kilometres to the east of the modern city. In 1786, the city's name was changed to Surin in honor of its governor. 
The province slowly grew in population, there was a continual influx of people from surrounding areas, principally Cambodia (part of what is now western Cambodia was ruled by Bangkok at this time), however Surin was largely self-sufficient, and somewhat isolated. This changed with the advent of the railroad in 1922. Surin and its economy was exposed to the wider world. Chinese and Indian merchants settled, manufacturing increased, and Surin joined the modern world.
Tourism.
"City Pillar Shrine." ศาลหลักเมืองสุรินทร์. The shrine is the sacred icon, the tutelary deity of the city and the province. Prior to 1968 the shrine did not house a pillar. This changed in 1968 when the Thai Fine Arts Department designed a new city shrine. A city pillar for this new shrine was made from a golden cassia log, donated by a Mr. Prasith Maneekan. A new shrine is under construction c. 2010. 
"The Monument of Phaya Surin Phakdi Si Narong Changwang (Pum)." อนุสาวรีย์พระยาสุรินทรภักดีศรีณรงค์จางวาง (ปุม). This is a statue of Surin’s traditional founder and first mayor, Phaya Surin. The black, brass statue is 2.2 metres high, and was dedicated in 1968. The statue is located at the southern entrance to the city, at what is now a major traffic round-about, but was in the past, the inner wall of the city. Pum stands on a high plinth, and is depicted holding a with curve-blade pike in right hand. This is a traditional device used to control an elephant. The pike reflects his legendary skill in controlling war elephants, and recognises the important of the role of elephants in both the history and economy of Surin. 
"Wat Burapharam." วัดบูรพาราม. This ancient Buddhist temple was built by Surin’s first mayor Phaya Surin Phakdi Si Narong Changwang. The Wat houses a Buddha image of Luang Pho Phra Chi, which was built at the same time as the temple.
"Surin National Museum." พิพิธภัณฑสถานแห่งชาติ สุรินทร์. The Surin National Museum was established in 1974. It was first housed in the Surin City Hall, but was later moved to the Surin Education Office. In 1992 the Thai Fine Arts Department proposed a dedicated museum building for the province. Construction of the museum began in 1995, and was completed in 2010. The Museum is now located in Ban Nongtao, Chaniang sub-district, Mueang district, on highway 214. The Museum covers five topics: natural science, history-archaeology, local history, ethnology, and local heritage. 
"Lower Isan Art and Crafts Centre." ศูนย์ศิลปาชีพอีสานใต้. Located on a bypass road, close to Tambon Nok Mueang Administration organization, southeast of Surin City. The centre displays art and culture exhibits of Lower Isan.
"Huai Saneng." ห้วยเสนง. Huai Saneng Reservoir has a high and steep crest. Its southern area has a rich display of water lilies and flocks of birds. The palace of Mother Princess is located in the headquarters of "Phanom Sawai Forest Park." วนอุทยานพนมสวาย. The park has a hill with three peaks. The first peak, Yot Khao Chai, or the Man Peak, is where Wat Phanom Sawai is located. The second peak, Yot Khao Ying, or the Lady Peak, houses a medium-size Buddha image. The third peak, Yot Khao Kok, houses an octagon pavilion.
Surin has many expatriates living within its Centre and Suburbs.
Festivals.
"Surin Jasmine Rice and Silk Cloth Fair." งานวันข้าวหอมมะลิอินทรีย์และมหกรรมผ้าไหมสุรินทร์. Held every January, the Fair features contests of agricultural products, silk cloth, and presentations from governmental institutions. 
"Thai Elephant Day." งานวันช้างไทย. A light and sound show which describes the legends of Thai elephants. Held annually in the second week of November.
"Ascending Phanom Sawai Mountain Festival." งานประเพณีขึ้นเขาพนมสวาย. This annual festival is a parade of traditional art and culture to Phanom Sawai mountain, in order to pay respect to Phra Yai, the intimate Buddha’s footprint, Luang Phu Dun, and Wat Phanom Silaram. This festival is held in March.
"Surin Elephant Round-up and Surin Red Cross Fair." งานช้างและกาชาดสุรินทร์. The annual fair is held every third week of November at Si Narong Stadium. Since ancient times, Surin is rich of elephant. Suay ethnic people has turned wild elephant into their vehicles and their talent in elephant controlling has made debut for Thailand. The Round-up features contest of elephant’s dining table, elephant welcome float, the world’s biggest dining event of the elephant, and performance such as elephant capture, tug of war between elephant and men, elephant football match, war elephant, and local performances such as Ruam An-re and Kantrum. 
"Ordination parade on elephant’s back." งานประเพณีบวชนาคแห่ช้าง. The vibrant tradition is held mostly on the 13th-15th day of the waxing moon in May (around mid of May) at Wat Chaeng Sawang, Ban Ta Klang, Amphoe Tha Tum. Khmer, Laotian, and Suay people are all Buddhist and families wish their sons to enter monkhood and study the dhamma before marriage. The ordination of large numbers of monks simultaneously on elephant back over long distances confer great merit on the families of the ordainees. As all participants dress decoratively with mat-mi silk, the tradition earns lots of merit which is passed down through generations. The parade comprises more than 50 elephants crossing the Moon River, with ordainees having shaved heads, all paying homage to Chao Pho Wang Thalu Shrine before starting the ordination.

Utang na loob

Utang-na-loob (pronounced: "u-tang na lo-ob", lit. "debt of inside") is a Filipino cultural trait which academics sometimes refer to as "reciprocity," and which transliterates as "a debt of one's inner self ("loob")." It is also sometimes translated as a "debt of gratitude." In the study of Filipino psychology, utang na loob is considered an important "accommodative surface value," along with "hiya" (shame) and "pakikisama" (togetherness). That is to say, it is one of the values by which the Filipino accommodates the demands of the world around him, as opposed to confrontative values like "lakas ng loob" and "pakikibaka".
The essence of utang na loob is an obligation to appropriately repay a person who has done one a favor. The favors which elicit the Filipino's sense of utang na loob are typically those whose value is impossible to quantify, or, if there is a quantifiable value involved, involves a deeply personal internal dimension. This internal dimension, loob, differentiates Utang na Loob from an ordinary debt("utang"); being an internal phenomenon, utang na loob thus goes much deeper than ordinary debt or even the western concept of owing a favor. Filipino psychology explains that this is a reflection of the "kapwa" orientation of "shared person-hood" or "shared self", which is at the core of the Filipino values system.

Logos and uniforms of the San Francisco 49ers

The logo and uniforms of the San Francisco 49ers have evolved since their inception in 1946.
The Early Years (1946-63).
The 49ers changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often in their first eighteen years of existence. From the team's inception in 1946 through the early 1960s, the San Francisco 49ers usually wore red, white or silver helmets, white or light-gray pants, and cardinal red (home) and white (road) jerseys. The 49ers' original logo was a mustached 49er gold miner from the 1849 California Gold Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and fired pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word "Forty-Niners" from its smoke. By the mid-1950s this logo showed the prospector jumping against a backdrop of Kezar Stadium, the team's home from 1946 to 1970.
Original uniforms consisted of plain red jerseys with white front and back numerals and no trim. Pants were white, and leather helmets were in several colors. In 1950, concurrent with the team's admission to the NFL, the red jersey gained three parallel white stripes on the sleeves; this feature, with modifications and updates, has been implemented on the team's jersey ever since. Also around this time, the helmets were gradually changed over to a silver-colored plastic. An entirely new look appeared in 1953; helmets were red with a silver center stripe. White pants were given a thin red-black-red tri-stripe. For the 1954 season silver-grey pants were introduced, and in the 1955 season the jersey numerals gained black trim that created a "dropshadow" effect. These 1955 jerseys, along with white pants, served as the model for the team's "throwback" uniform in its championship 1994 season. Red socks included three white stripes. In 1956 the helmet was changed to solid white and the black outlining and shadowing effect was eliminated from the jersey numerals. The pants striping became solid red. In 1957 the 49er uniform was altered again; helmets were made gold, accompanied by beige-gold, unstriped pants. Jerseys and socks remained the same, but in accordance with the NFL's 1957 rule ordering primary-colored "home" and light "road" shirts for each team, the 49ers debuted white road jerseys with three parallel sleeve stripes; the middle stripe was red, the top and bottom gold. This striping was replaced in 1958 by a wide red crescent shoulder stripe. So-called "TV Numbers" appeared on both jerseys in the same year.
Throughout the middle and late 1950s, and the early 1960s, the 49ers were one of just a few NFL teams (the Chicago Bears were most prominent) to use helmets made by Chicago-based Wilson Sporting Goods; these helmets were of slightly different shape than those made by the Riddell company, which for more than a half-century have been a prominent supplier of NFL team headgear. Yet another radical alteration was made to the 49er uniform in 1960. Appearing were silver helmets with three widely spaced red stripes; the center stripe was thicker. Home jerseys were unchanged, but road jerseys featured a new dual crescent shoulder stripe in what is usually called the "UCLA" style. An alternate logo was designed in the 1960s featuring a shield-shaped crest formed from the number "49", with a football in the upper right quadrant and "SF" in the lower left quadrant. In 1962 the helmet was redesigned to feature a red-white-red triple center stripe (the white middle stripe was wider). The earliest version of San Francisco's current primary logo, an intertwined white "SF" within the center of a red oval, also debuted in the 1962 helmet design. By 1972-73 the oval was slightly smaller in size and gained a thicker black border.
A More Standard Look (1964-88).
The team's colors then changed in 1964. All silver elements were changed to what was called "Forty-Niner Gold;" helmets were gold, with the same striping and logo. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. The scarlet red jerseys kept the traditional three red sleeve stripes, but road jerseys abandoned the previous dual crescent shoulder stripes in favor of three red sleeve stripes (the converse of the home jersey). The red home jerseys had white block numbers, three white parallel stripes on the sleeves, and smaller white block "TV" numbers above these stripes on the upper sleeve, with the color scheme reversed for the white road jersey. The red elliptical helmet logo was made slightly smaller in 1971-72 and received a thicker black border around the oval. From 1964 to 1971, the team's gold pants were unique in that they consisted of two varying colored panels: a more lustrous gold fabric was used on the rear portion of the pants and a lighter-hued, less lustrous beige fabric on the front. This pants design was abandoned from 1972 onwards for a more uniform, subdued beige. On very few occasions from 1971-1973, when traveling to play against teams in warm-weather venues that wore white jerseys at home such as the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints, the 49ers would don thinner mesh-fabric red jerseys that were missing the usual sleeve stripes and TV numbers. There was also a white version of this warm-weather jersey that was worn on even rarer occasions.
The 1964 uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next thirty seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970–74 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping would be worn until 1995 (as well as for throwback games from 2002–08). Starting in 1984, there was a change in the numeral font (the number "2" was made a squarer block numeral), along with the gradual narrowing of the jersey striping. For the 1986 season, the 49ers incorporated a special 40th anniversary patch sewn on the pants along the side of the hips.
1989-93.
In 1989, the 49ers' jerseys were further slightly altered with the stripes on the sleeves being made less bold and arranged closer together (sleeves on NFL jerseys began to get shorter and closer to the shoulder around this time). As for the team's helmet logo, black outlining on the intertwined "SF" was also added in 1989. For the 1990 season, concurrent with the rest of the teams in the NFL, the 49ers incorporated a small NFL Shield logo sewn on the bottom of the jersey's collar for the first time (this would be replaced with a redesigned "NFL Equipment" Shield logo for the 2002 season).
Prior to the 1991 season, the 49ers announced a prototype for a new logo and helmet design. Instead of the traditional "SF" oval, this new logo featured a stylized "49ers" in white with black and red shadows, along with a red facemask. However, fan reaction was so overwhelmingly negative that the idea was scrapped the next day. The only carryover from the 1991 planned uniform change (and the last significant change to the 1964-1995 uniform design) was the switch from red socks with three white stripes to solid red socks.
1994-95.
During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore "throwback uniforms" on occasional games (beginning with week 3 of the season) to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that had black outlines and dropshadows (the smaller TV numerals above the shoulder stripes however, were removed as they were non-existent on the original 1950s jerseys). White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks (the team later reverted to their regular solid red socks after receiving permission from the NFL to wear the uniforms for the rest of the season). The regular 1989-95 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 red helmet.
The team first donned the 1955 throwback uniforms during their week 3 match against the Los Angeles Rams and the following week at home versus the Saints, with both being wins (coincidentally, these were also the first two games Deion Sanders played after signing as a free-agent with the 49ers). The team then suffered an embarrassing 40-8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at home wearing their regular uniforms with gold pants, with Steve Young angrily being benched to prevent him getting injured. For the subsequent three games until their BYE week, the team again was scheduled to play games wearing the throwback uniforms with white pants and dropshadow numerals, and all three games resulted in wins. As the 49ers embarked during the following weeks on what would eventually be a 10-game winning streak that ultimately culminated in a Super Bowl XXIX victory, the team (prompted both by the superstition of then coach George Seifert, as well as the preference of players) petitioned the NFL to wear the throwback uniforms for the rest of the season, which was granted. The switch to solid red socks after the team's BYE week in the middle of the season marked this occurrence. In all the 49ers went 15-1 (including the playoffs) wearing the 1955/1994 throwback uniforms, (the only loss being the regular season finale on the road at Minnesota, with the team wearing white jerseys and resting most of their starters for the playoffs). Meanwhile the 49ers went undefeated wearing the red jerseys of the throwback uniform. After winning Super Bowl XXIX however, the team was compelled to revert to wearing its regular 1964-style uniforms (1991 revised design) for the following 1995 season.
1996: 50th Anniversary Uniform change.
In 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 50th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red. The smaller TV numerals were moved from the side of the upper sleeve above the sleeve striping to the top of the shoulderpads. Other new modifications to the uniform showed marked influence from the 1994 throwback uniforms: a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). Black trim was added on the sleeve stripes as well, which also now featured an updated oval "SF" logo. The team's helmet underwent a major redesign as well in 1996. The updated oval logo (now in cardinal red) had a more stylized, "stretched" black border along with gold trimming, while the intertwined "SF" had thicker black bordering and shadows. For the helmet's color a shinier, more metallic gold was used, while the helmet striping was changed from red-white-red to black-cardinal-black. The old gray-colored facemask was also switched to a cardinal-red colored one. As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). The socks remained solid-colored, though switched to the darker cardinal red.
1998 - 2008.
For the 1998 regular season opener, the team made a surprise switch back to gold pants, only this time to match the helmet it was a shinier, more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval "SF" logos placed on both sides of the hip. The 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants would be worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season.
From the 1980s until 2005, the 49ers nearly always wore their white uniforms at home for their two preseason home games (and thus usually wore white jerseys the whole preseason,) while the team wore red for all eight regular season home games. Since 2006, the 49ers have worn red jerseys for all home games including preseason. The team also is occasionally compelled to wear red on the road when visiting warm-weather opponents early in the season (if that opponent elects to wear their white jerseys), or if an opponent's established home jersey is white, such as the Dallas Cowboys (and on most occasions the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins).
Starting in 2002, the 49ers regularly used their 1980s-style (1989 version) scarlet and beige-gold uniform as alternate uniforms for one or two home games (usually for "Alumni Day" and around Christmas). In all, the team would wear the retro uniforms on eight different occasions:
During the 2006 season, the 60th anniversary of the team's inception, a commemorative patch was on the jerseys for all games. For the 2007 season, the 49ers began wearing black cleats, following a growing trend among many teams in the NFL.
2009 uniform change.
On February 17, 2009, 49ers.com officially announced new uniforms to be presented to the public during 49ers Draft Day events on April 25, 2009. The showcased design would be adopted for the 2009 NFL season.
The uniform change rumors were confirmed by the team's chief operating officer Andy Dolich at the 49ers' State of the Franchise. When asked when they were going to change their uniforms "back to normal," Dolich replied stating, "Stay tuned. Don’t be surprised if you see championship colors back." During the design process of the new 49ers uniforms, considerable input was received from 49ers players, coaches, team alumni and fan focus groups which occurred over a period of two years (2006–08), and was then conveyed to NFL Equipment manufacturer Reebok. The uniforms were revealed on April 25, 2009, during the first day of the draft. 49ers players Patrick Willis, Josh Morgan, Dashon Goldson, Joe Staley, and Moran Norris (each accompanied by 49ers alumni) displayed the new uniforms at the 49ers draft party.
The new uniforms are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves). Because of less room along the side of the sleeves, the secondary "TV" numerals have been moved to the top of the shoulder pads (as in the 1996-2008 jerseys). Meanwhile a "49ers" wordmark ligature has been included below the collar on the front of the jersey, just below the NFL Equipment shield. The shade of red in the new jerseys is arguably slightly darker than the bright scarlet of the classic 1980s jerseys, but significantly lighter than the cardinal/crimson red used in the 1996-2008 designs. The new helmets retained the shinier metallic gold shell color and 1996-2008 stretched oval "SF" logo design (though the oval was in the new brighter shade of red). However, the helmet stripes were reverted to the classic red-white-red order, and the face mask returned to the more traditional color of neutral gray. When the new uniform was debuted the pants remained made of the same lustrous gold material of the 1998-2008 uniform, but by training camp and the preseason the pants were toned down to a duller sheen of flat gold, similar to the 1980s pants but more closely matching the shade of gold used in the new helmets rather than the old khaki/tan. The pants striping is also in the classic red-white-red order, though this time in a more standard, medium width and not the thick striping width of the 1976-1995 pants. Players had complained that the old thick pant stripes on the throwbacks were too restrictive to movement. The new pants also feature zippers along the front, an innovation over the traditional laces used. The team's socks retain a solid red look (and not the throwback uniform style that had three white stripes), again in the new brighter red team color.
Since the 2009 season, the team has chosen not to have any "throwback" games as in recent years (2002–08), as the new uniform is consistent with the "classic" 49ers look of the 1980s. However, there may be retro games in the near future that instead incorporate the red and silver/white designs from the 1950s and 60s.
2012 Nike uniform update.
For the 2012 NFL season, (and concurrent with the rest of the teams in the league), the official San Francisco 49ers onfield jersey, pants and socks were manufactured by Nike, along with other uniform paraphernalia (undershirts, gloves and cleats; though the latter two are not mandated for all players). The updated uniform design was revealed alongside those of the rest of the league at an official event organized by the NFL and Nike in Brooklyn, New York on April 3, 2012 (with former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith joining fellow players from each team as models).
For the 49ers' uniforms, not much in the overall appearance was drastically changed and much was carried over from the previous Reebok design (such as the truncated sleeve stripes). Looking to improve the NFL uniform's physical design rather than a wholesale updating of teams' graphic designs, Nike focused changes mainly on the cut, fit and finish of the uniform, basing them on Nike's "Elite 51" uniform template that had already been worn recently by college football teams in the NCAA. The new design utilizes more breathable fabrics on the jerseys and pants striping (and more moisture-resistant fabrics overall), and a new stretchable "Flywire" elastic stitching on the jersey collar. In addition, compartments for increased padding around the hip area that truncates the top portion of the pants stripes have been implemented, as well as lighter, aluminum d-rings for securing the belt straps. The former "NFL Equipment" shield of the Reebok era has also been abandoned league-wide in favor of a return to a simpler NFL shield logo on the collar and pants (made from a more rigid synthetic material instead of a fabric patch).

Next Level (Ayumi Hamasaki album)

Next Level is the tenth studio album (eleventh overall) by Japanese pop singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki, released by Avex Trax on March 25, 2009 in Japan. It was released as a CD only version, a CD+DVD version, and a limited edition 2CD+DVD version with the second CD containing live songs taken from her New Year's Countdown concert. Additionally, it is the first album by Hamasaki and one of the first albums in the world to be released as a USB flash drive. The 2GB flash drive includes the 14 songs of the album in MP3 format along with their lyric data, and six music videos in MP4 format. The flash drive edition is priced at ¥6800 (approximately US$68 at the time of release).
The album is certified Double Platinum for shipment of 500,000 copies.
Promotion.
"Green," the second a-side from the first single, was used to promote Panasonic's Lumix FX-37 in 2008. The title track, "Next Level," was used in Panasonic's Lumix FX-40 commercial in 2009 while "Rule," from the album's second single, is the international theme song for the film Dragonball Evolution.　Additionally, "Sparkle" was used in advertisements for the Honda Zest Spark.
At a price of 6,800 yen, the USB version is said to be a bargain, as typical USB drives typically sell for much less. The USB is packaged in a case the same size as a normal CD case, making it easy to display in stores. Oricon included the USB drive version in its sales tracking. Hamasaki explained, "As the way we listen to music changes from day to day, I looked at things from the listener's perspective and decided to sell it this way."
Legal issues.
On May 21, 2009, it was revealed that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police were investigating a publicity event held in April. Hamasaki made unexpected appearances in Shibuya to promote the release of her new book and the album "Next Level", but apparently either she or her manager failed to obtain the necessary permits for the event. The PR event happened on April 7, in front of the 109 Building in Shibuya. Approximately 8,000 people gathered to see Hamasaki, resulting in temporarily blocked roads. Before her appearance at 109, she also paid unexpected visits to a few major record stores, going from store to store by car while fans followed her on foot, which led to chaotic conditions in the streets. Buses and other modes of transport were subjected to traffic delays.
Even though the events officially took place in stores, police determined that the scope of the event required a permit for the use of the roads. Because that permit was never obtained, authorities stated they plan to send the matter to the prosecutor's office for Hamasaki and her manager to be questioned.
Music videos.
Aside from the singles "Days/Green" and "Rule/Sparkle", two other music videos were made for "Curtain Call" and "Next Level". "Next Level" and "Curtain Call" were both directed by Stanly Izumi Kim and Luis Hernandez and filmed in Los Angeles.
The PV for "Next Level" featured Ayumi singing in her car while driving along an open road near the coast of a beach.
The PV for "Curtain Call" depicted Ayumi wearing a little black dress while barefoot. She starts off singing at a set. When the first verse is over she walks away and the production staff and crew close down the set. She walks through different sets and crew (including different seasonal themes such as rainy, autumn and winter). In the climax, she stops and behind her sparks a wall of fireworks. The curtain closes and the camera moves away from Ayumi and she is seen being attended by her hair and makeup crew. The whole video in entirety was done in one take. Originally, when she filming the black dress had a long and heavy part, but she said to her crew she wanted the heavy part to be cut off.

Peter Thejll

Peter Andreas Thejll (born 1956) is a Danish astrophysicist and climate researcher. His research in solar variation helped provide evidence of the greenhouse effect on the Earth's climate in the late 20th century. In particular, his study with Knud Lassen on Northern Hemisphere land air temperature showed that the rise of 0.4 degrees Celsius since 1980 could not be accounted for by the solar cycle. Climatologists have pointed to this finding as an "actual piece of evidence for greenhouse warming".
Thejll received his undergraduate education at the University of Copenhagen. He received an M.S. in physics and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Delaware. 
Thejll was a Carlsberg Fellow at the Niels Bohr Institute and worked at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics. Thejll currently is a senior scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen. He is currently involved in the creation of a global automatic system to observe the Earth's reflectivity - albedo - using observations of the earthshine on the Moon. Such data can be used for climate change studies and calibration of satellite data as the measurements deliver independent data on the albedo. A telescope is now installed on Hawaii at the Mauna Loa Observatory. The Swedish research agency VINNOVA is funding this project.

Kenelm Edward Digby

"This article is about Kenelm Digby, the English lawyer and civil servant. For other people with the same name, see Kenelm Digby (disambiguation)"
Sir Kenelm Edward Digby KCB, GCB, (9 September 1836 - 21 April 1916) was an English lawyer and civil servant. He was Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1895-1903.
Digby was born in Wootton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, England, the son of Hon. and Revd. Kenelm Henry Digby (1811–1891) and his wife Caroline. The Digbys were an old-established county family from Dorset, with a strong tradition of public service. The Revd. Kenelm Henry Digby was the younger brother of Edward Digby, 9th Baron Digby) and Jane Digby.
Digby schooled at Blakeney in Norfolk and then at Harrow School. He graduated in 1859 from Corpus Christi College Oxford, and was called to the bar as a member of Lincoln's Inn in 1865. From 1868-1875 he taught at Oxford University, and published "An Introduction to the History of the Law of Real Property" in 1875, which soon became a standard textbook. He was a strong supporter of Gladstonian Liberalism and believed in "the greater importance of giving substantial power to the working classes". Later in his life he was involved in working out fair and effective means of compensating workmen for industrial injuries.
In 1892 Digby was appointed County Court Judge in Derbyshire, and in 1891 he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and in 1904 took silk. In 1894 he was unexpectedly approached on behalf of the Liberal Home Secretary, H. H. Asquith, about an appointment as Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office. However, a strong devotion to public duty weighed in the balance against his fears about his inexperience in administration and public office. In January 1895 Digby was appointed Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office, succeeding Sir Godfrey Lushington.
Digby was created KCB in 1898, retired in September 1903 and was created GCB in 1906. Over the subsequent ten years he sat as a member of numerous departmental committees of inquiry, chairing the Home Office departmental committee on workmen's compensation (1904), and acted as an arbitrator in labour disputes. In 1914 he was appointed a member of the commission to investigate alleged German war atrocities in Belgium. 
Digby married Caroline (1848–1926), second daughter of Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper, the Liberal politician, on 30 August 1870. They had four children - two sons and two daughters. One of his grandchildren was Kenelm Hubert Digby, the proposer of the notorious 1933 "King and Country" debate in the Oxford Union, and later Attorney General and judge in Sarawak. Digby died on 21 April 1916 at Studland in Dorset.

Anigozanthos flavidus

Anigozanthos flavidus is a species of plant found in Southwest Australia. It is member of the Haemodoraceae family. It is commonly known as the tall, yellow, or evergreen, kangaroo paw. The specific epithet, "flavidus", refers to the yellow flowers of this plant.
A member of the genus "Anigozanthus" (kangaroo- and cats-paws) that has an evergreen clump of strap-like leaves, up to 1 metre long and 0.2 m wide, growing from an underground rhizome around 0.5 m in diameter. The rhizome allows the species to regenerate after drought or fire. Each plant may produce over 350 flowers, on up to 10 long stems, these appear during the summer of the region. Pollen is distributed by birds as they plunge into the flowers to reach the nectaries. Flowers are frequently yellow and green, but may present in shades of red, pink, orange, or brown. It is found along roadsides, along creeks, and in forests and swamps, and other unshaded winterwet habitat.
The species occurs in a range from Two Peoples Bay in the southeast, throughout the Warren and southern Jarrah Forest, to Waroona on the Swan Coastal Plain. It was previously endemic to the region, but is now naturalised in New South Wales. This kangaroo paw is now widely cultivated in the Eastern states of Australia and the United States of America. 
"Anigozanthos flavidus" hybridises with other members of the genus, and is used in the development of cultivars. It is a hardy plant, tolerant of a wide range of soil types and condition, that may live for around 30 years in a garden. It is propagated from seed or sections of the rhizome.
The first description of the species was by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1807. This was published in Redouté's "Les Liliacees" with an illustration by that artist.

Walter Hand House

The Walter Hand House is located on Angola Road in Cornwall, New York, United States. It is the main building of a five-acre (2 ha) former farm, built around 1870, to serve as both a farmhouse and summer boardinghouse, in response to Cornwall's growing popularity as a summer resort.
Today it is known as Shadow Mountain Farm, owned and operated by the Cromwell Manor bed and breakfast to the east along Angola. Both properties were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996.
Property.
The house sits on a gentle rise with a view to the west highlighting Schunemunk Mountain. The lot is the remainder of a much larger farm that has been subdivided since the house was built. There are six other buildings besides the house, all considered contributing resources to the NRHP listing.
It is a five-bay two-and-a-half-story clapboard-sided structure with Gothic detailing and a molded cornice and plain frieze at the roofline. The wooden-shingled roof, pierced by brick chimneys at either end, is cross-gabled by a two-story rear wing projecting from the south side, itself with a one-story pent-roofed bay on its own west.
A one-story porch fronts the entire east elevation, with a flat roof, bracketed cornice, piers with decorated capitals and a plain frieze similar to the roofline. Elaborate cutouts form the guardrail between piers.
Inside, the house follows a center hall plan. Many of the original finishings, hardware and trim remain. The attic, used as lodging for summer boarders, is completely finished as well.
The six other buildings, all contemporary with the house's original construction, are located slightly downhill and to the rear. There are a small complex of two two-story wooden barns, a kitchen building since converted into a home, a carriage house with its original doors and hardware, and a shed.
History.
The house was built some time around 1870 by Hand, descended from one of Cornwall's oldest families. A successful apple farmer, he saw the growing interest of New York City residents in spending their summers amid the fresh air of Cornwall, and had the house's attic finished to take some in during that season. It was effectively built to be both a farmhouse and a summer boardinghouse.
It has passed through a variety of owners since then. Recently it has returned to its original use as lodging, with the owners of Cromwell Manor operating it as Shadow Mountain Farm Cottage, a bed and breakfast.

Charles Allen House (Worcester, Massachusetts)

The Charles Allen House is a historic house at 65 Elm Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is notable as an unusual and well-preserved Second Empire house, and as the home of Massachusetts lawyer, politician, and jurist Charles Allen. Built in 1870, The three story mansard-roofed building is basically square in plan, with an ell projecting from its rear, and a central pavilion slightly projecting from its front facade. The pavilion rises two stories, and is topped by a pedimented gable. The main roof cornice is studded with modillions, as is that of the porch that shelters the front entry. The house was apparently the idea of Charles Allen, and occupies a lot which previously belonged to Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr., who had built a house there which Allen had moved a short distance to make way for this house. Allen was a high-profile Worcester native, working in law practice with John Davis, another Massachusetts governor. He served in the state legislature and as a local judge before being appointed the first chief justice of the newly-organized Massachusetts Superior Court. He turned down an offer of a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Allen died in 1869, and the house may have been completed by his heirs, who owned the property into the early 20th century.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Meng Yi

Meng Yi was an official who lived in the Qin dynasty. He served in the court of Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. He was a younger brother of the general Meng Tian. After Qin Shi Huang's death, Meng Yi and his brother were executed by Qin Er Shi (Second Emperor of Qin) on the urging of the eunuch Zhao Gao.
Life.
Meng Yi's ancestors were from the Qi state in the Warring States Period. His grandfather, Meng Ao (蒙驁), left Qi and came to the Qin state. Meng Ao served under King Zhaoxiang of Qin and his highest position was "Senior Minister" (上卿). During the reign of King Zhuangxiang of Qin, Meng Ao was appointed as a general and he led Qin's armies to attack Qin's rival states Han, Zhao and Wei. Meng Yi's father, Meng Wu (蒙武), served as a general during the reign of King Zhuangxiang's son, Ying Zheng. Meng Wu participated in the Qin campaign against the Chu state as a deputy of the general Wang Jian and succeeded in conquering Chu.
In 221 BCE, Meng Yi's elder brother, Meng Tian, was appointed as a general due to his family background. Meng Tian led the Qin army to attack the Qi state and conquered it, after which he was commissioned as an "Interior Minister" (內史). With the fall of Qi, Qin had succeeded in unifying all the states in China under its rule. Ying Zheng proclaimed himself "Qin Shi Huang" (First Emperor of Qin) and established the Qin dynasty. In the following years, Qin Shi Huang put Meng Tian in charge of defending the Qin Empire's northern border from attacks by the Xiongnu and overseeing the construction of the Great Wall. Qin Shi Huang trusted the Meng family and regarded them very highly. Meng Yi served in Qin Shi Huang's court as a minister and was one of the emperor's close aides and advisors. He was allowed to ride in the same carriage as the emperor and stand near the emperor during court sessions. When Zhao Gao, a eunuch serving as a personal attendant to Qin Shi Huang's youngest son Huhai, committed a serious offence, the emperor ordered Meng Yi to prosecute Zhao according to the laws. Meng Yi went by the book and noted that Zhao Gao was to receive the death penalty and be stripped off his official titles. However, Qin Shi Huang eventually pardoned Zhao Gao on account of the latter's diligence in performing his duties.
In the winter of 210 BCE, Qin Shi Huang became seriously ill while he was on an inspection tour in eastern China so he sent Meng Yi to help him pray to the gods on his behalf. Before Meng Yi returned, the emperor died at Shaqiu (沙丘), with only Zhao Gao, Huhai and Li Si by his deathbed. Zhao Gao and Li Si secretly changed the emperor's final edict — which named his eldest son, Fusu, as his successor — and named Huhai the new emperor instead. The altered edict also ordered Fusu and Meng Tian, who were away at the border, to commit suicide. Fusu faithfully followed the order but Meng Tian felt suspicious and repeatedly requested for confirmation, but was placed under arrest. When Huhai heard that Fusu was dead, he wanted to spare Meng Tian, but Zhao Gao advised him against it because he feared that the Mengs would take revenge against him.
When Meng Yi returned from his mission, Zhao Gao suggested to Huhai to exterminate the Meng clan, but Huhai had Meng Yi arrested and imprisoned in Dai (代). Meng Tian, who had already been arrested earlier for defying the edict, was imprisoned in Yangzhou (陽周). After Huhai returned to the Qin capital Xianyang, he held a grand funeral for his father, after which he ascended the throne as Qin Er Shi (Second Emperor of Qin). Zhao Gao became Qin Er Shi's close aide and he often spoke ill of the Mengs in front of the emperor and urged the emperor to get rid of them.
Fusu's son, Ziying, strongly advised Qin Er Shi against executing the Mengs, but the emperor refused to listen. Qin Er Shi sent an envoy to meet Meng Yi and order Meng to commit suicide. Meng Yi gave a long reply, in which he hinted that the emperor had no reason to execute him. However, the envoy, who knew that the emperor wanted to see Meng Yi dead, ignored Meng's response and killed the latter. Meng Tian committed suicide in Yangzhou later by consuming poison.
Modern references.
Jackie Chan portrayed the protagonist, Meng Yi, in the 2005 Hong Kong film "The Myth". This character is loosely based on the historical Meng Yi. In the film, Meng Yi is reincarnated as a present-day archaeologist who embarks on a quest to find a mysterious element that can make objects hover in air.

Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi

BMJ (Ben Mutua Jonathan) Muriithi (born Jonathan Nyaga on May 4, 1969) is a Kenyan writer, Radio Presenter, stringer and actor based in the United States. He is currently the Regional Western Hemisphere International Correspondent for the Swahili Service of Voice of America, a multimedia international broadcasting service funded by the U.S. Government through the Broadcasting Board of Governors. He is also a regional reporter for NTV, one of the Kenya's mainstream media outlets, QTV and Nation Newspaper, all owned by Nation Media Group (NMG). He previously worked for The Standard as a US Correspondent.
Biography.
Muriithi was born in Kanyuambora village, Embu district, Eastern province, Kenya. A Son of Kenyan small scale farmers, the late Sospeter Kironji Mutua and Jane Igoki Kironji, he rose from a relatively modest family background to head one of the most popular drama clubs in Kenya, the Mt. Kenya Theatrix, before moving to the United States.
Early life, School and career.
Muriithi and his now late brother, Stephen Njagi Kironji, started acting in their village church at a very young age. He later joined Kangaru School, Embu, Kenya, from where he graduated in 1986. He later joined a private School in Thika, Kenya. He became the YMCA Drama Club Chaperon in 1988 and later that year, he was elected to head the Youth Department at the Thika YMCA branch. In 1990, he trained as a registration Assistant at Kenya Institute of Surveying and Mapping (KISM) in Ruaraka, Kenya. Upon graduating, Muriithi was hired by the Kenya Government and posted in Eastern Province as a Registration Assistant. While working with the Lands Department at the Eastern Provincial Headquarters in Embu, he joined renowned thespian, Joseph Murungu in the newly formed Mt Kenya Theatrix Drama Group under the auspicies of the Kenya Red Cross, Embu Branch. While on an Exchange program tour co-sponsored by the Kenya Red Cross Society and the Norwegian Red Cross Society, he enrolled for a certificate course in acting and Photojournalism at Haraldvangen Institute in Norway, graduating in 1992. Upon his graduation, he featured prominently in Kenyan Radio, Television and stage productions, culminating in being appointed the Executive Chairman of Mt. Kenya Theatrix Club in 1995. Some of the productions he featured in included Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi Is Dead; Joseph Murungu's So Sweet a Bite; and a few of Kenyatta University's Professor Francis Imbuga's published works. During his days in Nairobi, he featured in some high profile TV commercials, including one by then Celtel (later Zain and now 'Airtell'), one of Africa's leading telecommunication companies.
Artistic activity.
Although he may not be in the league of Kenya's top actors like Paul Onsongo, John Sibi-Okumu or Njeri Osaak, Muriithi has nevertheless contributed immensely to the Kenyan media and theater scene. Earlier in his career, he traversed the country with members of Mt. Kenya Theatrix, sensitizing people on the dangers of HIV/AIDS through Community Theater under the auspicies of Plan International, a non-governmental humanitarian organization famed for its social empowerment programs. During his High School days, he was named the entertainer of the year - class of 1986 - for his wit and humor in his weekend stand-up comedies.
Muriithi produced and presented the arts segment of John Obong'o Jr.'s Kenya Beat, a popular Kenyan radio program aired on Monday mornings. He was also a co-presenter of Dunia Wiki hii, a news roundup program produced by Kenya's renowned radio personality, Hamisi Themor. Besides his duties at KBC, Muriithi produced and presented "Biashara Ndogondogo", a popular radio program aired on Saturdays by Nairobi based Nation Radio, which is owned by Nation Media Group. While working with the media houses, he simultaneously served as a registration assistant with Kenya's department of lands in both Embu and Nairobi. In 2002, he moved to Georgia, USA where he is currently studying Communication and International Relations at Atlanta Metro College. He is a correspondent and News editor with a US-based Kenyan Newspaper, Kenya Empowerment Newspaper. He is also a Syndicated correspondent with Kenya Broadcasting Corporation and a reporter for Minneapolis-based Mshale Newspaper. Before leaving Kenya, he sat on the provincial adjudication board for Kenya Schools and Colleges Drama Festival. Mureithi is married to Edith N. Muriithi who is a Medical Assistant and a student at Georgia Perimeter College. His daughter, Carole Wawira Muriithi (born September 4, 1992) is currently a High School student in Hanoi, Vietnam, in which city her mother, Fiona Clare, works for CARE International.
In September 2009, he was contracted by Voice of America (VOA) as a regional stringer. 
In mid-2010, the Nation Media Group hired him as a regional reporter for their flagship TV Station, NTV on contract basis.
In 2007, he was among the first journalists to shed light on the departure of CNN's Africa Bureau Chief, Jeff Koinange, from the giant media organization.
On November 23, 2008, his article, 'An Africa to-do list for Obama' was published in Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the main Newspaper in the State of Georgia, USA. The same was later published by The Washington Post, the oldest DC newspaper with the largest circulation in the City.
Activism.
In the early 1990s, Muriithi teamed up with fellow thespians, including Packson Ngugi and a group of activists led by firebrand Kenyan politician and now Cabinet Minister James Orengo, to protest the government's intention to sell the Kenya National Theatre building to the adjacent Norfolk Hotel against the wishes of the artists. The idea was consequently shelved.
In October 2009, Muriithi received an award from Kenya's ambassador to the U.S. for what the Kenyan Embassy in Washington DC termed "his Professional support and cooperation with the Embassy". It was presented amid pomp and color at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia by HE. Peter Ogego, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.
Controversy.
In the early 1990s, Muriithi declined a job offer as a newscaster on the government run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation on principle. In a Newspaper interview carried by The Standard, a leading Kenyan Daily, on September 5, 1995, the journalist said he could not take up the job as a Swahili News anchor owing to his opposition in the way the media house was carrying out its business. "It is a mouth piece for President Daniel Arap Moi and his cronies and much as I would love to serve my country in that respect, my conscience does not allow me," he was quoted as saying. And in opinion pieces carried by the local dailies in the mid-1990s, he lodged a scathing attack on President Moi's administration terming the second president of Kenya as "one of the worst dictators the world has seen in recent times". Observers have often wondered whether the journalist has any particular political leaning since he is equally critical of the current Kenyan President, Mwai Kibaki. In a recent radio interview on VOA which broadcasts from Washington DC, he quipped; "Kibaki's legacy is indelibly tainted by his association with the Moi administration. How does he explain his total silence as Moi's administration killed and tortured Kenyans with impunity while he (Kibaki) comfortably sat in the same government, holding powerful positions, including that of the Vice President of the republic of Kenya?
In an interview on VOA on September 26, 2010, Muriithi criticized president Kibaki for what he termed "open nepotism" saying almost all the key positions in his wing of the coalition were held by his tribesmen, save for a few held by his close cousins, the Ameru. He was equally critical of Prime minister, Raila Amolo Odinga. "Why is his sister the Consul General in Los Angeles yet she is a PHD in Chemistry? Don't you think he should try to at least conceal the open nepotism?" he asked the VOA interviewer.
Asked what he thought of the founding president of Kenya as the country marked its 48th birthday, Muriithi said that Kenyatta laid the foundation for the official corruption which is so rampant in Kenya today. "He perfected tribalism and amassed great wealth (including vast tracts of land) while ignoring the real heroes, the freedom fighters some of who lost their lives, property and dignity as they fought for independence," he said.

Piet de Jong (artist)

Piet Christiaan Leonardus de Jong (August 8, 1887–April 20, 1967) was an artist who worked on the illustration and reconstruction of archaeological sites in the Mediterranean, including Mycenae, Knossos, Eutresis, Gordion, and the Athenian Agora.
Life and career.
Piet Christiaan Leonardus de Jong was born in Leeds, England on August 8, 1887. His father, Jacques Leonardus de Jong, was a Dutch immigrant, and his mother, Rosa Teale de Jong, a Yorkshire native. Piet had two siblings: an older half-sister, Gwendolyn (b. 1880), and a younger brother, Arton Carl (b. 1893). For his education, Piet first attended the Leeds Boys’ Modern School. Piet later attended the Leeds Institute of Science, Art, and Literature, where he studied architecture. After completing his studies, Piet de Jong won several architectural prizes, including two from the West Yorkshire Society of Architects (prize in 1908, silver medal 1909). In 1912, Piet received the Soane Medallion. This prize included a travel award of 50 lb from the Royal Institute of British Architects. With this prize money, Piet was able to travel to Italy in 1912 to study Classical architecture. In 1913, Piet returned to London as a member of the Leeds architectural firm Schoefield and Berry. Also in 1913, Piet designed his first and only building in England: the First Church of Christ Scientist, Leeds. In 1914, World War I broke out, and in 1916 Piet joined the army as a Lance-Corporal in the Army Cyclist Corps. Although the precise details of Piet’s participation in WWI are unknown, he most likely served as part of the East Riding Yeomanry.
Piet de Jong first traveled to Greece in 1919 as part of the post-war reconstruction program for eastern Macedonia. Although the reconstruction project ultimately dissolved, at this time Piet first met the excavator of Mycenae, Alan Wace. In 1920, Piet began work as an architect and archaeological illustrator for the Mycenae excavations. Piet worked on the Mycenae excavations until 1923, during which time he produced the famous reconstruction of Mycenae Grave Circle A.
From the 1920s to the 1950s, Piet de Jong applied his skills as architect and artist to the illustration, recording, and reconstruction of some of the most famous excavations in Mediterranean archaeology. In 1921, Piet worked for the excavations at Halae, under Hetty Goldman. Also in 1921, on February 14, Piet married his wife Effie. At the time of her marriage, Effie was living in Athens and working as an English teacher. She accompanied Piet deJong on many of his archaeological projects. Piet deJong’s work at Mycenae earned him a positive reputation. Thus in 1922, Piet deJong was hired by Sir Arthur Evans to work on the recording and reconstruction of the palace at Knossos on Crete.
In the following year (1923), Piet de Jong was the first person appointed as the “official architect” for the British School at Athens. Many of the publications of archaeological finds produced by the British School during this period include plans, plates, and drawings by Piet de Jong. From 1923-1926, Piet worked at Sparta, and in 1924 at Eutresis. During the 1920s, Piet de Jong also worked at Zygouries, excavated by Carl Blegen, and at Corinth, under both Bert Hodge Hill and Leslie Shear.
Piet returned to Crete every year from 1922-1930. During this time, Piet deJong designed and directed much of the reconstruction work at Knossos. This work included both architectural reconstruction (especially the Queen’s Megaron and Throne Room), and frescos (the dolphin fresco). In the 1930s, Piet de Jong produced drawings for the archaeological excavations at Perachora and Prosymna, and in 1932 began work as illustrator for the excavations at the Athenian Agora. Unfortunately, the events of World War II forced Piet deJong to return to Leeds from 1939 to 1947.
In 1947, deJong returned to Crete as the curator of Knossos. The Knossos excavations were now directed by Sinclair Hood, who continued to employ Piet in the recording and reconstruction of the Knossos material. In 1952, Piet relinquished his post as Knossos caretaker, but continued to produce watercolors and reconstructions both at Knossos (1957–61), and for a number of other archaeological projects. In 1957, Piet produced watercolor reconstructions of the fresco paintings from the so-called “Painted House” at Gordion. Around the same time, deJong also produced the plates for the material excavated by John Caskey at Kea. Until 1965, Piet de Jong worked again for Carl Blegen at Pylos, where Piet produced his famous reconstructions of both the Palace of Nestor and its ornate floor. Piet’s final archaeological assignment, the watercolor reproduction of several Minoan frescos, began on Crete in 1966. While still in Crete and at work on these frescos, Piet de Jong died on April 20, 1967.
Archaeological illustration and reconstruction.
As an archaeological illustrator and architect, Piet de Jong was responsible for both the accurate recording and the reconstruction of a wide variety of archaeological materials including: pottery, frescos, figurines or other small objects, and architecture. Watercolors, both translucent and opaque (gouache), on paper, were de Jong’s preferred medium for the execution of archaeological illustrations. DeJong also produced many pencil and ink drawings.
Piet de Jong was a talented artist. However, he was not trained as an archaeologist. Many of his reconstructions take extreme artistic license in the interpretation of the archaeological remains. For example, Piet’s reconstruction of the “dolphin fresco” at Knossos, is formulated around a very small number of fresco fragments.
In addition, Piet de Jong did not produce a style of documentation which would be considered sufficient for modern, quantitative, standards of archaeological recording. Another group of examples is de Jong’s illustration of ceramic finds. Modern drawings of archaeological ceramics tend to include both a “section”, or profile drawing, of the vessel and an “elevation,” a depiction of its outside face. In contrast, Piet de Jong’s illustrations do not include a section and elevation, but rather tend to depict the entire outside profile of the vessel, often from a distorted perspective, in order to make as many of the object’s defining attributes visible to the viewer as possible.
Caricatures.
Piet de Jong was also a talented caricaturist. Forty-four Piet de Jong caricatures, also in watercolor, have also been published. The majority of the subjects for these paintings were archaeologists from the excavations for which Piet worked as architect. Some of the more famous of Piet’s scholarly subjects include Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, and Alan Wace, excavator of Mycenae. Other caricatures feature students and other so-called “helenophiles” living in Athens, associated with either the American School of Classical Studies at Athens or the British School at Athens. In his will, Piet de Jong bequeathed all of his personal caricatures and other watercolors to Minoan archaeologist Sinclair Hood. These artworks are now in the archives of the Knossos Trust, where they have resided since 1990.

The Hommelvik train disaster was a train collision at Hommelvik Station, on the Meråker Line (today part of the Nordland Line) in Norway.
On 19 November 1940, a train with workers from Trondheim Central Station to Trondheim Airport, Værnes collided with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains were supposed to have passed at Hommelvik Station, but the engineer thought he had seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered.

Song Yi (Qin dynasty)

Song Yi (died 207 BC) was a minister of the insurgent Chu kingdom during the final years of the Qin Dynasty.
Biography.
Song Yi joined Xiang Liang's insurgent Chu kingdom around 209 BC, when rebellions broke out throughout China to overthrow the Qin Dynasty. In 208 BC, Xiang Liang found Xiong Xin, a descendant of the royal family of Chu, and installed him on the throne of Chu as King Huai II.
After engaging Qin forces in various battles, Xiang Liang began to grow contemptuous of the enemy due to the small amount of resistance that he encountered. Song Yi warned Xiang Liang that his overconfidence and his troops' inattentiveness would lead to defeat against the Qin army. At that time, the Lord of Gaoling (高陵君), an envoy from the insurgent Qi kingdom, was travelling to Chu and he encountered Song Yi along the way. Song Yi told him to slow down his pace because he was sure that Xiang Liang would meet his downfall. Song Yi's prediction was right as Xiang Liang was killed in action against the Qin army, led by Zhang Han, at the Battle of Dingtao.
The Lord of Gaoling met King Huai II later and recommended Song Yi to the king, saying that Song "may indeed be said to understand the art of warfare." The king summoned Song Yi and discussed strategic issues with him, after which he appointed Song Yi as commander-in-chief of his army, with Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Fan Zeng serving as his deputies. Song Yi was commissioned to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao kingdom, which was under attack by Qin.
In 207 BC, the army reached Anyang (安陽; southeast of present-day Cao County, Heze, Shandong) and Song Yi ordered them to halt and wait for 46 days without making further movement. As the Zhao capital Handan was under siege by Qin forces, Xiang Yu advised an immediate crossing of the Yellow River to attack the Qin army, but Song Yi ignored him, preferring to move when Zhao and Qin were exhausted from fighting each other. Song Yi then gave an order that any man who was "fierce as a tiger, recalcitrant as a ram, greedy as a wolf, so headstrong they will not submit to orders" should be decapitated, hinting that the assassination of Xiang Yu would be agreeable to him. He sent his son, Song Xiang, to the Qi kingdom, and accompanied his son to a drinking party at Wuyan (無鹽; east of present-day Dongping County, Tai'an, Shandong).
Xiang Yu was angry with Song Yi and he gave a speech to the other generals, decrying Song's extravagance and unconcerned attitude towards military affairs. The next morning, when entering the commander's tent to make his morning report, Xiang Yu took Song Yi by surprise and killed him, seizing Song's command of the army. Xiang Yu then denounced Song Yi for committing treason, saying that Song was plotting with Qi against Chu, and his execution was authorised by the king.

<doc id="21524892" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21524892" title="Redknife Formation">
Redknife Formation

The Redknife Formation is a stratigraphical unit of Devonian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 
It takes the name from Redknife River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River, and was first described in the banks of the Trout River, north of Trout Lake, Northwest Territories, at Table Rock Rapids by Belyea and McLaren in 1962.
Lithology.
The Redknife Formation is divided into the Jean Marie Member (base) and an upper unnamed shale unit. The Jean Marie Member is composed of argillaceous, silty and dolomitic fossiliferous limestone. The carbonates are massive east of Fort Nelson and west of the Alberta border. The upper Redknife consists of calcareous shales with silty limestone and siltstone interbeds. To the south and east, the shales grade into limestone and siltstone, and it becomes dolomitic in the Peace River arch.
The Redknife formation contains common coral and brachiopod fossils.
Oil/gas production.
Gas is produced from the Jean Marie Member in the Greater Sierra filed east of Fort Nelson, British Columbia.
Distribution.
The Redknife Formation occurs in outcrops in the southern Northwest Territories and in the sub-surface in north-eastern British Columbia, also reaching into north-western Alberta. The maximum thickness of the upper shales is , and the lower carbonates are up to . The Jean Marie Member is found in outcrops south of the Mackenzie River between Kakisa and Blackstone River. It grades westwards into the shale facies of the Fort Simpson Formation. East of the Peace River Arch it turns into the carbonates of the Kakisa Formation.
Relationship to other units.
The Redknife Formation is conformly overlain by the Kakisa Formation and overlies the Tathlina Formation in northern Alberta and the Fort Simpson Formation in British Columbia and Northwest Territories. The Fort Simpson Formation replaces the Redknife Formation to the west. The Redknife Formation can be correlated with the Nisku Formation and upper part of the Ireton Formation in central Alberta.
Subdivisions.
The Jean Marie Member is designated as the lower part of the Redknife Formation where it is represented by massive limestone or silty carbonates. The Jean Marie Member was deposited during the Frasnian age. It is named for the Jean Marie River.

Barbara Lauwers

Barbara Lauwers (April 22, 1914 – August 16, 2009), later known as Barbara Lauwers Podoski, was a corporal in the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) and won the Bronze Star after one of her operations led to the defection of 600 soldiers from behind Italian lines and the withdrawal of their support from the Germans. She was stationed at the for Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Morale Operations (MO) headquarters in Rome, Italy.
Background.
Barbara Lauwers was born Božena Hauserová in 1914 in Brno, then Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. She became a lawyer and just before the break out of war she also became a journalist. Lauwers got married and she and her husband moved to Belgian Congo in 1939 when events started to escalate in Europe. In 1941 they moved to USA. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, her husband joined the army and she went to work at the Czech embassy in Washington, D.C. before joining the WAC herself. She was sent to Algeria and then Rome, Italy where she pursued her work at the MO.
World War II Work.
While in Rome, Corporal Lauwers assembled a team of German prisoners to work in counterintelligence and psychological warfare. The prisoners worked as “cobblers”— spies who create false passports, visas, diplomas and other documents. She conducted Operation Sauerkraut, which infiltrated enemy lines with teams of German prisoners that spread “black” propaganda regarding Hitler throughout occupied Italian towns. 
Corporal Lauwers also created the "League of Lonely War Women" or VEK in German. This mythical organization was to demoralize German troops by making them believe that the females in their lives back home were having casual relations with other soldiers. Eight faked field post letters in the German language were produced by the OSS in Italy with the total number of forged field post letters that were printed in Rome being indicated in an OSS production report. 287,000 copies were produced in the period between 15 July 1944 and the end of the war. The operation was so successful that the Washington Post was fooled and ran a story on 10 October 1944 entitled, “German soldiers on leave from the Italian front have only to pin an entwined heart on their lapel during furloughs home to find a girlfriend.” The newspaper got the story from a circular which had been captured on the Eighth Army front and was actually written by Lauwers and carried behind German lines by the Sauerkraut agents. 
In another mission, Corporal Lauwers led a team in writing and delivering “black” propaganda targeting soldiers attached to the German army in northern Italy. On 29 April 1945, this mission was so successful that 600 troops defected behind Italian lines and withdrew their support from the Germans. This operation was the reason that Corporal Lauwers was given the Bronze Star.

Rancho San Joaquin

Rancho San Joaquin, the combined Rancho Cienega de las Ranas and Rancho Bolsa de San Joaquin, was a Mexican land grant in present day Orange County, California given to José Antonio Andres Sepúlveda. In Spanish "Cienega de las Ranas" means "Marsh of the Frogs" and "Bolsa" means "Pocket", and usually in reference to wetlands landforms.
History.
Rancho Cienega de las Ranas was granted to José Sepúlveda (1803–1875) by Mexican Alta California Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado in 1837. Rancho Cienega de las Ranas encompassed present day Irvine and the San Joaquin Hills. Additional land, Rancho La Bolsa de San Joaquín, was granted to Sepúlveda in 1842. Rancho Bolsa de San Joaquin encompassed Newport Bay and estuary in present day Newport Beach southeast to Laguna Canyon Creek flowing to present day Laguna Beach. Together these two ranchos formed Rancho San Joaquín.
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho San Joaquin was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to José Sepulveda in 1867.
Following the drought in 1864, José Andrés Sepúlveda sold Rancho San Joaquin to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby and James Irvine, and it eventually became part of the Irvine Ranch.

List of Marvel Comics nicknames

Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Stan Lee was known for bestowing humorous nicknames on himself, as well as Marvel's other creators, members of the "Bullpen," and various staff members (i.e.., "Marveldom Assembled"). Later editors-in-chief like Roy Thomas and Archie Goodwin continued the tradition, until Jim Shooter discontinued the practice in the 1980s. It was re-established by Mark Gruenwald when he started editing "Bullpen Bulletins" in the late 1980s. The convention was inspired, at least in part, by a Hollywood tradition, where character actors in particular were given colorful nicknames to aid in their name recognition.
Monikers like Stan "The Man" Lee and Jack "King" Kirby permeated into mass culture. This is a list of those nicknames.

Racetrack problem

A racetrack problem is a specific instance of a type of race condition. A racetrack problem is a flaw in a system or process whereby the output and/or result of the process is unexpectedly and critically dependent on the sequence or timing of other events that run in a circular pattern. Note that this problem is semantically different from a race condition because of the circular nature of the problem.
The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other in a circular motion to influence the output first. Racetrack problems can occur in electronics systems, especially logic circuits, and in computer software, especially multithreaded or distributed programs.
The term "Racetrack problem" was coined by a Research Engineer at Penn State University. This engineer noticed that the problem seemed to involve a racetrack, instead of just any kind of race.

Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities

A KSA, or Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities, is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to United States Federal government job openings. KSAs are used to determine, along with resumes, who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. In 2009 the Office of Personal Management asked federal agencies to stop requiring job applicants to fill out the questionnaires, to be phased out within a year.
KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position. A knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) is a concise essay about one's talent and expertise and related experiences (work, education, volunteerism) and accomplishments. A series of KSA statements are usually required when applying for most federal government and some state and city government jobs. KSAs are used as a metric to assess the capabilities of a prospective applicant in terms of likely ability to perform the duties of the job. Most government hiring officials look for a short, crisp, and clear KSA that emphasizes results or accomplishments obtained in previous work.
KSA statements are also known as Evaluation Factors. Other agencies sometimes call them "Rating Factors", "Quality Ranking Factors", "Knowledge, Abilities, skills, and Other Characteristics", or "Job Elements". The name can be just a name but it often influences content and length of the essay. Every agency has its own regulations, but most of the time the each KSA factor should be 1/2 to 1½ pages long.
The below definitions are defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management:
The scoring of KSA essays is based on a scale of from 1 to 100. Job applicants must score above 70 to be considered for the position. High scores are derived through answering the KSA question as specifically as possible, providing examples from previous employment or training that clearly demonstrate the applicant meet the qualifications.
When applying to federal government positions, a Federal Resume is usually required in addition to KSA statements.

SM UB-44

SM "UB-44" was a Type UB II submarine or U-boat for the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. "UB-44" operated in the Mediterranean and disappeared in August 1916.
"UB-44" was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September. "UB-44" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an deck gun. As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service, "UB-44" was broken into railcar sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and launched in April 1916 and commissioned in May.
In two patrols in her three-month career, "UB-44" sank one ship of . In early August 1916, "UB-44" departed from Cattaro for Hersingstand and never arrived. Her fate is officially unknown, but she may have been sunk by a torpedo boat near the island of Paxoi on 8 August.
Design and construction.
The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, "U-47" could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats.
The Imperial German Navy ordered "UB-44" from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as one of a series of six UB II boats (numbered from to ). "UB-44" was long and abeam. She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draft of when surfaced. She displaced while submerged but only on the surface.
The submarine was equipped with twin diesel engines and twin electric motors—for surfaced and submerged running, respectively—that drove twin propeller shafts. "UB-44" had a surface speed of up to and could go as fast as while underwater. The U-boat could carry up to of diesel fuel, giving her a range of at . Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of at while submerged.
"UB-44" was equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The U-boat was also armed with a 5 cm KL/40 (2.0 in) deck gun.
"UB-44" was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 3 September 1915. As one of six U-boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction, "UB-44" was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped overland to the Austro-Hungarian port of Pola. Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola, where she was launched on 20 April 1916.
Service career.
SM "UB-44" was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 11 May 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Franz Wäger. "UB-44", Wäger's fourth U-boat command, was assigned to the Navy's Pola Flotilla (). Although the flotilla was based in Pola, the site of the main Austro-Hungarian Navy base, boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro-Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean. German U-boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs.
On 30 June, Wäger and "UB-44" achieved their only success when they sank the steamer "Moeris" southeast of Cape Sidero, Crete. The 3,409-gross register ton British steamer was carrying a general cargo from Glasgow for Alexandria when she went down with the loss of three men.
After Germany's conquest of Romania (see "Romania during World War I"), the German Imperial Navy had sufficient fuel oil for submarines located in the Black Sea. "UB-44" and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies in the middle of 1916. "UB-44" departed from Cattaro on 8 August for Hersingstand (located on the Gallipoli peninsula) to pick up a pilot for the trip through the Dardanelles, but never arrived.
"UB-44"s fate is unknown. Two British post-war reports list "UB-44" as falling victim to the Otranto Barrage on 30 July but, as author Dwight Messimer points out, German records record "UB-44"s departure from Cattaro nine days after that. Messimer reports that it is possible that "UB-44" was sunk by the torpedo boat "HMS 368", which was reported by an Athenian newspaper as sinking a U-boat on 8 August off Paxoi with a lance bomb.

Love Hope Strength

Love Hope Strength Foundation is a charitable foundation whose purpose is to raise funds and awareness in order to benefit people with cancer and leukaemia. The charity carries out sponsored treks and climbs to the world's highest mountains, often performing musical concerts at the peak.
Origins.
In spring 2001, at age 31, James Chippendale, an American businessman, was diagnosed with 
leukemia, needing a bone marrow transplant to recover. After his recovery in 2003 he founded a cancer charity, the Love Hope Strength Foundation (LHSF) with fellow survivor Mike Peters, a Welsh musician and lead singer with The Alarm.
Activities.
The charity raises funds for cancer treatment, promotes awareness and early detection, and advocates for bone marrow registration by holding rock concerts at remote, elevated venues, including Everest base camp, the top of the Empire State Building, the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, with a concert at Mount Kilimanjaro in 2009. The UK organisation holds an annual trek to the top of Wales' highest mountain, Snowdon, each summer, and has added a number of other events, including Rhondda Rocks, Avebury Rocks and Ben Nevis Rocks.
LHSF concerts feature both amateur and professional musicians, and have featured high-profile rock musicians including Chuck Berry, The Fixx's Cy Curnin, Squeeze's Glenn Tilbrook, Everclear, The Beat, Nick Harper, Chris Summerill and members of The Cult. The first four shows had raised almost $1 million by September 2008.
LHSF is a beneficiary of a documentary film called More To Live For [http://moretoliveforfilm.com/], which details James Chippendale's cancer and survivorship experience.

Bermeja

Bermeja is an islet lying off the north coast of the Yucatán peninsula according to several maps of the Gulf of Mexico from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Despite being located somewhat precisely in relation to neighboring islands by notable Spanish cartographers of the 16th century, the island was not found in a 1997 survey, nor in an extensive 2009 study conducted by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) on behalf of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Interest in the island arose in late 2008, fueled by the fact that if such an island existed, it would be important for determining the boundaries for exploitation rights of oil in "Hoyos de Dona" (Doughnut Holes) in the Gulf of Mexico.
The island is first mentioned by Alonso de Santa Cruz in "El Yucatán e Islas Adyacentes", a list of islands of the region published in Madrid in 1539. Its precise location is given in "Espejo de navegantes" (Seville, ca. 1540) by Alonso de Chaves, who wrote that from a distance, the small island looks "blondish or reddish" (in Spanish: "bermeja"). According to Michel Antochiw Kolpa, a French-Mexican cartographer, since 1844 British maps have reported the sinking of the island some sixty fathoms below.
Explanations for its apparent disappearance include an erroneous observation by the early cartographers, shifts in the geography of the ocean floor, rising sea levels and conspiracy theories claiming that the CIA destroyed the island to expand the economic zone allotted to the United States.

Shelburne Falls and Colrain Street Railway

The Shelburne Falls and Colrain Street Railway was a rural trolley line that operated in the western Massachusetts towns of Buckland, Shelburne and Colrain from late 1896 to late 1927. Interchange was with the Boston and Maine Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad at the south end of the line at the Buckland station, which is on the opposite side of the Deerfield River from the village of Shelburne Falls.
In 1927, faced with mounting debt, the SF&C ceased operation and was sold at foreclosure. The line was scrapped in 1928. The only surviving equipment of the SF&C is the 32'9" eight-wheel Combination Baggage-Passenger car #10, manufactured by the Wason company of Springfield, MA in 1896. The car has been fully restored to operating condition and today resides at the Shelburne Falls Trolley Museum at the site of the old Buckland depot. Brass models of this specific car were made by Fomras of Japan and imported to the US.

<doc id="21525287" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21525287" title="Pink Chaddi Campaign">
Pink Chaddi Campaign

The Pink Chaddi Campaign (or Pink Underwear Campaign) is a nonviolent protest movement launched by "Consortium of Pub-Going, Loose and Forward Women" in February 2009 in response to notable incidences of violent conservative and right-wing activism against perceived violations of Indian culture, when a group of women were attacked in a pub in Mangalore. The campaign was a brainchild of Nisha Susan, an employee of Tehelka political magazine. The campaign was conceived particularly in protest against a threat by Pramod Muthalik of the Sri Ram Sena (also spelled as "Sri Ram Sene" and "Sriram Sena"), an orthodox Hindu group based in Mangalore. Muthalik threatened to marry off and take other action on any young couples found together on Valentine's Day.
Background.
On 6 February 2009 in an incident of moral policing a group of men who claimed to belong to Sri Ram Sena attacked a group of women in Mangalore, India. Later that month, Muthalik announced an action plan to target couples found dating on 14 February, Valentine's Day. He said "Our activists will go around with a priest, a turmeric stub and a mangalsutra on 14 February. If we come across couples being together in public and expressing their love, we will take them to the nearest temple and conduct their marriage.
Reaction.
After widespread outrage over his speech, the Bangalore and Mangalore police stepped up protection in public places and local hangouts, despite which there was an attack by the Sri Ram Sena on five women in a pub in Mangalore. Two women patrons were hospitalised in a critical condition. Of 40 perpetrators, only three have been arrested so far.
On 9 Feb 2009, Home Minister P. Chidambaram said that "Sri Ram Sene is a threat to the country. The Centre is watching its activities with great concern"
Pink Chaddi campaign.
In the midst of the tension, a protest was started by a group of young women, called the "Pink Chaddi" campaign, where they urged a peaceful protest (described as Gandhian in the press) to all of India, by sending pink underwear ("Chaddi" in Hindi) to Muthalik's office on Valentine's Day.
The novel form of protest was initiated by Nisha Susan, Mihira Sood, Jasmeen Patheja and Isha Manchanda As the protest grew, underwear started pouring in from locations all over India in solidarity for the "Love Sena". Over 500 pink chaddis were couriered on Friday. Other cities collected hundreds of such chaddis and decided to courier them directly. There has been a tentative truce established as Pramod Muthalik has expressed an inclination for a dialogue to resolve this issue..
Ostensibly, the chaddi (underwear) had been chosen as a symbol, since right wing groups like the RSS of India are derogatively called "chaddies" (short pants), which is part of the uniform that RSS members wear during their meetings.
Reaction to the campaign.
The Pink Chaddi Campaign received widespread media coverage, and the Facebook group saw numbers of members growing exponentially in the following days. A few reports were also critical of the campaign accusing it of trivialising an important issue like attack on women.
There was also political reaction to the campaign as supporters of RSS objected to use of pictures of RSS members on the campaign blog. RSS had criticised the Mangalore attack and favoured ban on the Sri Ram Sena. The blog owner removed the pictures of RSS members following this objection.
A counter-campaign calling itself "The Pink Condom Campaign" was started by some unknown activists a few days before Valentine's Day.
Preventive custody.
As an additional precaution, Muthalik and 140 others of the Sri Ram Sena were held in preventive custody on Valentine's Eve.
Facebook group defaced.
Shortly after the campaign took off, the campaign's Facebook group began to be attacked by trolls and was eventually broken into. Attackers renamed the group and included racist slurs and death threats in its description. The attacks continued despite appeals to Facebook's support department for help, and eventually Facebook disabled the account of the group's administrator and access to the group. The group has decided to avoid Facebook in future.

Clinton Fearon

Clinton Fearon is a Jamaican reggae singer and musician born on January 13, 1951 in Saint Andrews, Jamaica. He has lived Seattle, Washington since 1987.
Career.
Jamaica.
Clinton Fearon was born near Kingston, and quickly moved to St. Catherine, a rural Jamaican province. Fearon was heavily influenced by the music found at his local Seventh-day Adventist church. He returned to Kingston at age 16, where he founded his first band, The Brothers. Errol Grandison, who first encountered Fearon through his work with The Brothers, quickly offered him a chance to replace David Webber as the third member of The Gladiators. He joined the group in 1969, first as a singer and then as a bass player and background vocalist after the departure of both Grandison and David Webber. He remained with the group until 1987, often appearing as the leader on songs including "Chatty Chatty Mouth," "Rich Man Poor Man," "Get Ready" and "Let Jah Be Praised". During these years, he also worked as a session-man for a range of artists, including Coxsone, Lee Perry, Joe Higgs, Yabby You, Joseph Hookim and Prince Tony Robinson.
United States.
By the late 1980s, Fearon began to feel artistically crowded after nearly two decades of playing with the same band. As such, Fearon left the band and settled in Seattle, Washington following the Gladiators' 1987 American tour in order to launch his solo career. His first project in the United States, The Defenders, enjoyed a moderate success with the EP "Rock Your Bones" released in 1989. The group was short-lived, and disbanded in 1992.
In 1994, Fearon reorganized his musical vision by forming The Boogie Brown Band. The group's debut album, "Disturb the Devil," marks the beginning of Fearon's successful solo career and features Barbara Kennedy on keyboards, Lamar Lofton on bass, Girt Bolo on drums and John Saba on guitar. He followed this release with a series of other albums produced by his newborn record label, Boogie Brown Productions.
Notable releases under Boogie Brown Productions also include "Mi An' Mi Guitar," a 2005 acoustic album that refashions classic Gladiators recordings such as "Richman Poorman" and "Streets Of Freedom." Clinton Fearon followed "Mi An' Mi Guitar" with his 2006 album "Vision," which is composed of long, melodic songs that masterfully complement his earlier solo releases. In 2008, Clinton Fearon released "Faculty Of Dub," featuring all original music as well as his own bass playing for the first time in nearly two decades.
Present.
Clinton Fearon splits his time between Seattle and France, and continues to tour with The Boogie Brown Band and promote his newest album, "Heart And Soul". It reached number 20 of the World Music Charts Europe in August 2012.

<doc id="21525367" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21525367" title="Illinois Naval Militia">
Illinois Naval Militia

The Illinois Naval Militia was a naval militia created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1893, and finally dissolved in 1988. As a state defense force it was not part of the Illinois National Guard or National Guard of the United States. 
Formation.
In September 1892 a meeting was called by Lieutenant-Commander B. M. Shaffner, attended by more than 20 graduates of the Naval Academy at Annapolis who were resident in Chicago, which proposed the formation of a State Naval Militia. The following year a bill was finally passed, and approved by Governor Altgeld, which provided for the creation and establishment of the Illinois Naval Militia, to consist of two battalions, each having a maximum strength of 400 men, and a minimum of 140. The 1st Battalion was based in Chicago, and the 2nd Battalion in Moline on the Mississippi. The 1st Battalion initially had 225 men, divided into four divisions, while the 2nd Battalion, had 176 men at its foundation, soon rising to 206.
The 1st Battalion met one evening each week and practiced boat-drill, both sail and oar, and were trained in the use of torpedoes, for which a steam-launch was specially fitted; and in the use of artillery, the cutlass, and small arms. The Navy Department presented the First Battalion with a complete stand of Hotchkiss rifles, cutlasses and revolvers, a Hotchkiss Rotary Gun and a battery of four 3-inch breech-loading field guns. Each summer there was a three week cruise, for which the Militia was loaned a ship, usually obsolete, by the Navy. Up until 1901 this was usually the .
The officers of the militia were all former naval men, and several were veterans of the Civil War. There was also an associate membership, composed of many of the leading merchants, bankers and professional men of Chicago, including Marshall Field, Lyman J. Gage, and Charles Deering. Further, honorary memberships were awarded to Shelby M. Cullom, J. Frank Aldrich, and Colonel Leroy P. Stewart, Inspector General of the First Brigade of the Illinois National Guard.
Following the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, there were plans to move the replica battleship "Illinois" to a pier near Van Buren Street, where the ship would have become the headquarters of the militia.
By 1896, the Illinois Naval Militia had five divisions: three in Chicago, one in Moline, and one in Alton, of approximately 250, 100, and 50 men respectively. At that time, it received $25,000 in federal funds annually, and operated several boats and a steam launch.
World War I.
In late 1916 the Illinois Naval Militia was federalized into the National Naval Volunteers, created by an act of Congress and approved on August 29, 1916, under which the President was permitted to call them up for active duty with the United States Navy. Detailed plans for mobilization were prepared, and within forty-eight hours of the declaration of war on April 6, 1917, the entire Illinois Naval Militia had left Chicago by train for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Some were actually at sea within a week of the declaration of war, and many more on the first group of ships that left the United States bound for Europe.
At that time the Illinois Naval Militia consisted of 579 men organised into:
Later history.
World War I marked the high-point of the Illinois Naval Militia. The United States Naval Reserve was formed in 1915, and those states that maintained Naval Militias received very little federal aid, and then only if the members of their state Naval Militia were also members of the Naval Reserve, which offered more benefits. There was also competition for personnel from the Marine Corps Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary. Inevitably, the Naval Militia's popularity began to decline.
By the 1970s, the Illinois Naval Militia had become little more than a social club located on the Chicago waterfront. When the city annexed the property, the militia effectively ceased to exist, but was not formally dissolved until 1988. However, on January 19, 2006, it was reauthorized, though never re-established, by an executive order of Governor Rod Blagojevich. Senate Republicans disputed the governor's authority to resurrect the militia.

Reuben Rogers

Reuben Renwick Rogers (born November 15, 1974) is a Virgin Islands jazz bassist, composer and educator.
Biography.
Born November 15, 1974, and raised in the Virgin Islands, Rogers was exposed to varieties of music that included calypso, reggae, gospel and jazz. In his formative years, Rogers received encouragement from his parents to explore his musical talent. He began with the clarinet, experimented with the piano, drums and guitar, yet at the age of 14 found his true passion in the bass.
Under the eye of his high school band teacher Georgia Francis, Rogers studied jazz with fellow Virgin Islanders Ron Blake and Dion Parson. Rogers' potential was recognized by numerous awards, grants and scholarships from the St. Thomas Arts Council and other local organizations. This in turn opened the door for Rogers' summer studies at Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan and in Boston at Berklee College of Music. Upon completion of their five-week summer program, Berklee awarded Rogers a scholarship toward his degree studies.
Rogers' musical education was punctuated by numerous awards, most notably, a scholarship endowed by the Fish Middleton Jazz Society. He earned his Bachelor of Music in 1997 from Berklee College of Music. Rogers' command of both the electric and acoustic bass has aided him in adapting to various musical genres. This versatility in addition to his creative energy has led him to be a very sought after bassist. Rogers began touring professionally at the age of 17 with the Marcus Roberts trio. He has worked with jazz artists of world-renown, such as Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove, Joshua Redman, Nicholas Payton, Mulgrew Miller, Jackie McLean, Charles Lloyd and Dianne Reeves, amongst others. Rogers' peers continue to influence and enrich his musical style and direction. He has toured extensively all over the globe, and has recorded on over 70 CDs.
Ever committed to supporting the arts in the Virgin Islands, Rogers returns when his schedule permits to conduct music workshops in local schools and organize fundraising concerts that benefit the education of today's island youth. His musical endeavors come full circle during performances with Ron Blake and Dion Parson in the Caribbean jazz group 21st Century.

List of Super Friends episodes

"Super Friends" is American animated series about a team of superheroes which ran from 1973 to 1986 on ABC. In the 1990s, the show was being shown on Cartoon Network and more recently its sister channel, Boomerang. It is based on the Justice League and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics.
Each episode was 60 minutes long. After the third season, it was reduced to 30 minutes and ever so often expanded cast of characters by featuring other JLA heroes joining the main five Super Friends (Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman and Robin) on a semi-regular basis. The series episodes varied from single episode stand-alone stories to episodes with two, three, or even four segments.
The varied incarnations of the group, from "Super Friends" (1973–1974) through "" (1985–1986), were considered by their creators to be one series. There were a total of 109 episodes, along with two episodes of "The New Scooby-Doo Movies", with Batman and Robin appearing in "The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair" and "The Caped Crusader Caper."
"Super Friends" episodes.
Season 7 (the “lost” season): 1983.
This season didn't air during a regularly scheduled Saturday morning time-slot, but did get aired when the series began to get aired in repeats/reruns on other networks. Interesting side note: In prior seasons, The Wonder Twins were only paired up with Batman & Robin or Wonder Woman. This season found them teaming up with other Justice Leaguers. In "Roller Coaster" they're paired with Atom. In "Two Gleeks" they're paired with Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. In "Unexpected Treasure" they're paired with Hawkman & Hawkgirl. In "Space Racers" they're paired with Wonder Woman & Flash.

Gene &amp; Jude's

Gene's & Jude's or ("sic:" Gene & Jude's) is a popular and iconic hot dog stand in River Grove, Illinois, founded in 1946 by Chicago city worker Gene Mormino. The stand is famous for its limited approach to the Chicago-style hot dog, its toppings departing from tradition by including only mustard, onions, relish, sport peppers and fresh cut French fries placed on top, known as a Depression Dog. The menu is limited to hot dogs, double dogs, tamales and fries, and, atypical of Chicago hot dog stands, lacks any trace of ketchup even for dipping the fries.
History.
In 1946 city worker Gene Mormino was at a Cubs game at Wrigley Field when Gene decided if he added French fries to his hot dog it would give it a gratifying dose of saltiness and crunchiness. Based on that idea, he started a hot dog stand at Polk & Western Streets in Chicago. The restaurant quickly gained popularity, but 3 years later Gene lost the entire stand in a card game in 1949.
In 1950 Gene gathered enough money and moved operations to the current location in River Grove, Illinois also taking in friend and co-worker Jude DeSantis. Since 2004 it has been owned and run by J. Mormino, Gene's son.
In 2006, Gene's & Jude's was inducted into the Vienna Beef Hot Dog Hall of Fame. In 2011, in a competition of 64 hot dog stands across the country, it was chosen by the magazine "Every Day with Rachael Ray" and the food blog Serious Eats as the best hot dog in America.
During the 50's, Gene and Jude's was a frame building and was not actually called Gene & Jude's-- the sign of the stand simply said "Vienna Red Hots." Customers referred to it as "River Road Hot Dogs." During the 1950s, Gene & Jude's had a takeout window, and its drinks were sold in bottles. Cock Robin (Formerly known as Prince Castle) was an Ice Cream Restaurant located in what is now the parking lot of Gene's & Judes. It was on the north east corner of the lot and they served ice cream sundaes, sodas, floats, shakes and blizzards. They used a square shaped ice cream scoop. Until 1978, Gene and Jude's did not serve napkins. 
 Gene and Jude's is a free standing hot dog stand in the middle of a large parking lot. The establishment does not have tables, so guests can either eat in their car or somewhere along the counter. There's one large counter where users can order at one end and pick up their food at the other. Behind this counter seems to be a variety of employees of different ages, ranging from teenagers to those in their older 60's. Some of the employees have been working there since the beginning. (2)
Awards
 Gene and Jude's has won Best Hot Dogs in America and it has consistently been in the top ten for Chicago's best quick eats yearly.
