Malinau Regency

Malinau Regency is a regency of North Kalimantan Province in Indonesia. The administrative centre is the town of Malinau. Malinau is also often called "Earth Intimung". The district is home to the Kayan Mentarang National Park.
Administration.
The regency is divided into twelve districts ("kecamatan"), tabulated below with their 2010 Census population.
History.
Malinau was originally a residential area inhabited by the Tidung ethnic group. Based on information from Tidung community leaders, the name Malinau originated when the Dutch settled an area formerly known as Desa (village) Selamban. At the time Desa Selamban was inhabited by the Tidung Tribe, while across the Kabiran river the village Pelita Canaan was inhabited by the Dayak Abai tribe. When the Dutch arrived in the Desa Selamban they met a group of Abai who were harvesting sago from the sago palm, and asked the name of the river that ran between the two villages. The Abai did not understand the questions, and assumed the Dutch wanted to know what they were working on. One of the Abai said "Mal Inau" which means harvesting sago in the local Abai language; "mal" meaning making, while "inau" means tree. Thus the name Malinau was born. A map of the area made during the colonial period called the local river "the Malinau", and the area has been known as Malinau since.
As people migrated into the area Desa Selamban eventually grew much larger and became a town, renamed Malinau. When Bulungan Regency was divided in 1999, Malinau became the administrative centre of the newly formed Malinau Regency. In December 2012, Malinau Regency became part of the new province of North Kalimantan.
Ethnic Groups.
There are a number of indigenous groups in Malinau, namely:

Bombardment of Fort San Carlos

The Bombardment of Fort San Carlos occurred during the Venezuelan Crisis on January 17, 1903, when two warships of the Imperial German Navy tried to penetrate into Lake Maracaibo but were repulsed by the garrison of Fort "San Carlos" after a brief exchange of fire.
Bombardment.
On January 17, SMS "Panther" and SMS "Falke" were chasing a merchant schooner who had evaded the blockade and entered the lake. Both ships intended to enter the lake and blockade the city of Maracaibo.
Guarding the entrance that connects the lake with the Gulf of Venezuela was the castle of San Carlos de la Barra. The shallow waters that connected lake Maracaibo with the sea were only passable for major ships in the strait that separated San Carlos from the island of Zapara, yet even there it was needed the help of a local pilot to sort the sand banks and shallow waters of the passage.
The battle started when the fort's gunners opened fire on the "Panther" when she was crossing the bar. The captain Richard Eckermann replied the fire but the shallow waters prevented the Panther from making an effective bombardment. Inside the fort, two of the gunners, Manuel Quevedo and Carlos José Cárdenas, managed to score several hits at the "Panther" with their 80-millimeter Krupp gun, causing considerable damage to the ship. After half an hour of exchanging fire, the Germans retreated.
Aftermath.
Four days later the "Panther" returned to reduce the fort, accompanied by the protected cruiser SMS "Vineta", with a much larger armament. A typical bombardment ensued for 8 hours, although outgunned the Venezuelan garrison attempted to resist with their cannon but by the end of the conflict, Fort San Carlos was in ruins and burning. Shells also hit the nearby port; whether intentional or not, the bombardment killed 25 civilians, prompting the arrest of German and British citizens by Venezuelan authorities.

Walk a Crooked Mile

Walk a Crooked Mile is a 1948 American film noir directed by Gordon Douglas. The drama features Louis Hayward, Dennis O'Keefe and Louise Allbritton.
Plot.
A spy ring has infiltrated Lakeview Laboratory of Nuclear Physics, a Southern California atomic research center. FBI agent Dan O'Hara and Scotland Yard detective Philip Grayson are on the case.
Production.
The film was originally titled "FBI vs Scotland Yard" but this was changed at the request of J. Edgar Hoover.
Reception.
When the film was released, "The New York Times" film critic, Bosley Crowther, while giving the film mixed review, wrote well of the screenplay, "No use to speak of the action or the acting. It's strictly routine. But the plot is deliberately sensational."
The staff at "Variety" magazine gave the film a favorable review, writing, "Action swings to San Francisco and back to the southland, punching hard all the time under the knowledgeable direction of Gordon Douglas. On-the-site filming of locales adds authenticity. George Bruce has loaded his script with nifty twists that add air of reality to the meller doings in the Bertram Millhauser story. Dialog is good and situations believably developed, even the highly contrived melodramatic finale. Documentary flavor is forwarded by Reed Hadley's credible narration chore."
More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, but echoing the 1948 "New York Times" film review, lauded the screenplay, writing, "Writer George Bruce adds a lot of plot twists from a story by Bertram Millhauser. It's a tolerable and unpretentious routine thriller that not only cautions against evil Russian Commie agents but possible American traitors in the scientific community. It was made at a time when the House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the government and Hollywood for communist infiltrators and Hollywood was sensitive to showing off to the right-wing politicians and the concerned American public that it was patriotic...Though the acting was vanilla, the melodramatics contrived and the story predictable, there was suspense finding out who was the leaker and the situation was kept plausible. It's not a particularly good film, but it was entertaining. Raymond Burr as one of the more ruthless gung-ho Commie spies makes for a wonderful villain, giving the film some bounce as he tries to kill his lawmen adversaries."

<doc id="31032602" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31032602" title="Taxon in disguise">
Taxon in disguise

In bacteriology, a taxon in disguise is a species, genus or higher unit of biological classification whose evolutionary history reveals has evolved from another unit of similar or lower rank, making the parent unit paraphyletic. This happens when rapid evolution makes a new species appear radically different from the ancestral group, so that it is not (initially) recognised as belonging to the parent phylogenetic group, leaving the latter an evolutionary grade. 
While the term is from bacteriology, parallel examples are found throughout the tree of life. E.g. four-footed animals have evolved from piscine ancestors, yet are not generally considered fish. The four footed animals can thus be said to be "fish in disguise". In many cases, the paraphyly can be resolved by re-classifying the taxon in question under the parent group, but in bacteriology renaming groups may have serious consequences as it may cause confusion over the identity of pathogens, and is generally avoided for some groups.
Examples of taxa in disguise in medically relevant microbial taxa.
Shigella.
The bacterial genus "Shigella" is the cause of bacillary dysentery, a potentially severe infection that claim the lives of over a million people annually. The genus ("S. dysenteriae", "S. flexneri", "S. boydii", "S. sonnei") have evolved from the common intestinal bacterium "Escherichia coli", rendering that species parephyletic. "E. coli" itself can also cause serious dysentery, but the difference in the genetic makeup between the "E. coli" and "Shigella" causes different medical conditions and symptoms. 
"Escherichia coli" is a badly classified species, since some strains share only 20% of their genome. Being so diverse it should be given a higher taxonomic ranking. However, due to the medical conditions associated both with "E. coli" itself and with "Shigella" the current classification will not be changed, to avoid confusion in medical context. "Shigella" will thus remain ""E. coli" in disguise".
B. cereus-group.
In a similar way, the "Bacillus" species of the "B. cereus"-group ("B. anthracis", "B. cereus", "B . thuringiensis", "B. mycoides", "B. pseudomycoides", "B. weihenstephanensis" and "B. medusa") have 99-100% similar 16S rRNA sequence (97% is a commonly cited adequate species cut-off) and should be considered a single species. Some of the members of the group appear to have arisen from other "Bacillus" strains by acquisition of a protein coding plasmid and the group may thus be polyphyletic. For medical reasons (anthrax "etc."), the current arrangement of separate species remain.

2011 Vancouver UFO sighting

The Vancouver, Washington UFO sighting occurred over two evenings in February 2011, as reported by many eyewitnesses in the Clear Meadows neighborhood of Vancouver, Washington, United States.
Description of events.
Reports included purple and red flashing lights appearing on the evening of February 20, 2011, as well as a flying saucer shape with green and red lights reportedly appearing just before 7:00 pm to Vancouver residents on the evening of February 21, 2011. Witness descriptions of the object included hovering for several minutes with occasional darting, side-to-side motions. No noise was reported to accompany the sightings.
One photo and two video recordings of the sighting were submitted to local media organizations. A photo by Joey Studdard shows a red dot with a trail of blue lights on a black background. A video of 52 seconds in length submitted to the KATU news webpage by Sandy Curtis, shows a set of flashing red lights, out-of-focus against a black background. Due to the hand-held motion of the camera and the absence of any background imagery, size and movements are very difficult to determine. A second video recorded on March 2, 2011 is over five minutes in length. Again, motion, size and speed are difficult to determine.
Possible explanations.
Peter Davenport, the director of the National UFO Reporting Center, first gave an opinion that the object spotted on February 21, 2011, was the star Sirius. Being the brightest star in the sky, Sirius is more likely to exhibit twinkling, color-changing effects. However, after viewing video of the object, Davenport later remarked: "I don’t believe it was a star. The object moved off. Stars don’t do that." 
Several reader comments submitted to "The Columbian", KGW and KATU websites claimed to have identified the object up close as an LED-equipped kite. Following news reports of the events, an individual giving his name only as "Mike" presented himself and his Chinese-manufactured kite as the source. The kite presented to "The Columbian" newspaper the week after the initial sightings stood 7 and-a-half feet tall with a 13 foot wingspan. Nearly 500 LED lights were hung from the triangle-shaped structure and were centrally-controlled to display different patterns including one depicting a flying saucer.
A kite equipped with LEDs was found to be the likely cause of similar UFO sightings in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 2010.

Dent Mowrey

Dent Mowrey (1888–1960) was an American composer, musician and music teacher who lived in Oregon from 1916 until his death in 1960.
Early life.
His birthplace isn't known for certain, but he grew up in Ogden, Utah. His father was a housepainter and his mother a dressmaker. As a child, Mowrey visited Oregon with his mother and fell in love with the state. His musical talents led him to the prestigious Leipzig Conservatory in Germany. After graduation he studied composition with Claude Debussy and gave recitals in Paris, including at the Sorbonne. Upon returning to the United States in 1916, Mowrey settled in Portland as a concert pianist, teacher, and composer.
Mowrey as teacher.
In 1928 Mowrey convinced the owner of the new Pacific Building, then the tallest building in Portland, to build a piano studio on the rooftop. Students rode the elevator to the roof and took lessons in the glass-walled studio, playing alongside Mowrey on one of two rare 9-foot Chickering grand pianos. According to Dolores Hsu, a student in the early 1940s, the acoustics were spectacular, and the music floated out from the rooftop garden that few below knew existed.
An early and influential member of the Oregon Music Teachers Association, Mowrey created music that other teachers valued for developing their students’ technique. At least a dozen of these works were published by G. Schirmer. Mowrey was also an early member of the Society of Oregon Composers and the Musicians Club of Portland.
Mowrey as composer.
Mowrey composed for the piano, vocal ensembles, band, woodwind and string ensembles, and orchestra. The Portland Symphony Society, now known as the Oregon Symphony, premiered several of his works starting with “The Gargoyles of Notre Dame” on the orchestra’s first national radio broadcast in 1927. 
While living abroad, he journeyed through the North African Sahara with a Beduoin caravan to research the native music there. His “Bedouin Melody” was performed by the Portland Symphony. His "Piano Concerto (Africa)", which he played with a number of West Coast symphonies, gave his impression of the contrasting civilizations of ancient and modern Africa.
A legacy recovered.
Mowrey did not seek the limelight and tended to be unassuming and private. In the late 1950s, his home was broken into. He and his wife Eve were locked in a closet. When they were finally found, the experience left them in a reclusive state, and Mowrey’s heart condition was worsened.
After Mowrey’s death in 1960, a report was given to the Oregon Historical Society along with concert programs, recital announcements, and lists of his published and unpublished works. His musical compositions were donated to the Multnomah County library in downtown Portland. Many of the pieces were not catalogued and sat in storage until 2009.
Allan Halbert, a conductor/music director in Oregon, was intrigued with the idea of reviving Mowrey’s music. When asked about the collection, the library decided to designate it as rare book material. The works, mostly manuscripts in Mowrey’s hand and written in pencil, were relocated to the John Wilson Special Collections room (open to legitimate researchers only, by request). As rare book material, they could not be checked out or photocopied, and the only option was to photograph them. Halbert photographed nearly one thousand pages of unpublished and unrecorded works and then began the process of restoring the music to a playable condition. This included retracing the notes and other markings with a pencil, creating missing parts, and correcting discrepancies between the scores and parts. Under Halbert’s direction, in June 2010 the Starlight Symphony of Beaverton, Oregon, gave a concert including “The Gargoyles of Notre Dame.”

Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995

Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995, US Senate bills S.390 and S.761. Senator Joe Biden introduced the bill on behalf of the Clinton Administration on Feb. 10, 1995. The bill was co sponsored by Senators Alfonse D'Amato, Dianne Feinstein, Robert J. Kerrey, Herb Kohl, Jon Kyl, Barbara A. Mikulski and Arlen Specter. Representative Chuck Schumer sponsored the bill (H.R. 896) in the US House of Representatives. Following closely on the heels of Executive Order 12947, prohibiting transactions with terrorists, President Clinton described the bill as a "comprehensive effort to strengthen the ability of the United States to deter terrorist acts and punish those who aid or abet any international terrorist activity in the United States" and requested "the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislative proposal by the Congress".
It contained the following seven provisions: 
Title I: Substantive Criminal Law Enhancements
Title II: Immigration Law Improvements
Title III: Controls Over Terrorist Fund-Raising
Title IV: Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives
Title V: Nuclear Materials
Title VI: Procedural and Technical Corrections and Improvements
Title VII: Antiterrorism Assistance
According to the summary by President Clinton, the bill was intended to establish federal criminal jurisdiction over acts of international terrorism. Civil liberty advocacy groups opposed the bill on the grounds that it would violate fundamental civil liberties, including the right to confront one's accuser. Another source of opposition was the Government's ability to use evidence from secret sources in deportation proceedings for suspected terrorists. During the debate over the Patriot Act of 2001 then Senator Joe Biden compared this bill to its 2001 counterpart stating "I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing. And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill."

History.
XM channel 161 originally launched as Discovery Channel Radio, and was heard on both XM and Sirius. On September 1, 2005, Discovery Channel Radio was removed from the XM lineup, and months later from Sirius. Eight months later, the channel was brought back to the lineup as a full-time simulcast of WSIX-FM in Nashville. This brought XM 161 under Clear Channel control, as they were able to select any vacant channel of their choosing. This was also the second time WSIX-FM was simulcast on XM, as it was also from 2001-2003 on channel 11, which was known as Nashville! until June 2011 and is now WSIX-FM yet again. 
On Friday, August 8, 2008, WSIX left XM Radio for the second time, and the channel began stunting with a commercial free country format. The following Monday, XM 161 played Beatles music nonstop for twelve hours, afterwards reverting to the country format.
Rock@Random launched on XM on Monday, August 18, 2008, with the song "Hush" by Deep Purple. There is currently no information on whether or not the station will carry a personality-driven lineup.
In December 2008, Rock@Random adjusted their playlist to include newer rock music into the 80s and early 90s.
On June 10, 2009: Rock@Random again adjusted their playlist to include many 80's pop/rock songs with some 70's added-in, however, the playlist provided only 16 hours of music before it repeated again, and with the same song order.
Since then, Rock@Random does not repeat songs too frequently, and does not play the same songs in the same order. It provides a great variety of rock music that is safe for public places because to the editing of profanity. The range of music is from Iron Maiden to Bob Seger, Judas Priest to Pink Floyd, Nirvana to Fleetwood Mac. The station is listed with a "CM" logo, which means the station includes commercials.
On February 22, 2011: Rock@Random was replaced on XM channel 161 by Sixx Sense.

V. N. Reddy

V. N. Reddy (20 November 1914December 1991) is an Indian cinematographer who worked predominantly in Telugu films, Bollywood, and few Tamil films for over thirty years starting from 1943. Reddy was born at Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh and was brought up in Anantapur. 
He developed a passion for cinematography at a very young age. "Badalti Duniya", his debut movie, was released in the year 1943. He first excelled in black-and-white photography and film making and then shifted to colour film making. His noted films are Aag (1948), Hulchul (1951), Baiju Bawra (1952), Meenar (1954), Chori Chori (1956), Kashmir Ki Kali (1964), Do Badan (1966), Upkar (1967), Purab Aur Paschim (1970) and Do Chor (1972).
Aag (1948) was made by a group of people in their twenties, Reddy being the oldest. It is considered one of the most significant films of all time. Writing about Reddy's work for the song "Dulhan Chali Pehan Chali" from the movie Purab Aur Paschim, the Indian movie review website, "Passion for Cinema" states 
Lakh Tandon and V. Gopi Krishna were Reddy's assistants. Reddy also tried his hand at directing movies like Ganga Gauri Samvadam (Telegu - 1958), Sengottai Singam (Tamil - 1958) Intika Deepam Illalu (Telegu - 1961), Ananda Jyoti (Tamil - 1963), and Zahreeli (1977) among others. 
Ravikant Reddy, one of Reddy's six children, at an early age of 13 to 14 years, was trained and apprenticed under his father is a noted cinematographer himself.

Pythagorean field

In algebra, a Pythagorean field is a field in which every sum of two squares is a square: equivalently it has Pythagoras number equal to 1. A Pythagorean extension of a field "F" is an extension obtained by adjoining an element for some λ in "F". So a Pythagorean field is one closed under taking Pythagorean extensions. For any field "F" there is a minimal Pythagorean field "F"py containing it, unique up to isomorphism, called its Pythagorean closure. The "Hilbert field" is the minimal ordered Pythagorean field.
Properties.
Every Euclidean field (an ordered field in which all positive elements are squares) is an ordered Pythagorean field, but the converse does not hold. A quadratically closed field is Pythagorean field but not conversely (R is Pythagorean); however, a non formally real Pythagorean field is quadratically closed.
The Witt ring of a Pythagorean field is of order 2 if the field is not formally real, and torsion-free otherwise. For a field "F" there is an exact sequence involving the Witt rings
where "I" "W"("F") is the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring of "F" and Tor "I" "W"("F") denotes its torsion subgroup (which is just the nilradical of "W"("F").
Equivalent conditions.
The following conditions on a field "F" are equivalent to "F" being Pythagorean:
Models of geometry.
Pythagorean fields can be used to construct models for some of Hilbert's axioms for geometry . The coordinate geometry given by "F""n" for "F" a Pythagorean field satisfies many of Hilbert's axioms, such as the incidence axioms, the congruence axioms and the axioms of parallels. However, in general this geometry need not satisfy all Hilbert's axioms unless the field "F" has extra properties: for example, if the field is also ordered then the geometry will satisfy Hilbert's ordering axioms, and if the field is also complete the geometry will satisfy Hilbert's completeness axiom.
The Pythagorean closure of a non-archimedean ordered field, such as the Pythagorean closure of the field of rational functions Q("t") in one variable over the rational numbers Q, can be used to construct non-archimedean geometries that satisfy many of Hilbert's axioms but not his axiom of completeness. Dehn used such a field to construct two Dehn planes, examples of non-Legendrian geometry and semi-Euclidean geometry respectively, in which there are many lines though a point not intersecting a given line but where the sum of the angles of a triangle is at least π.
Diller–Dress theorem.
This theorem states that if "E"/"F" is a finite field extension, and "E" is Pythagorean, then so is "F". As a consequence, no algebraic number field is Pythagorean, since all such fields are finite over Q, which is not Pythagorean.
Superpythagorean fields.
A superpythagorean field "F" is a formally real field with the property that if "S" is a subgroup of index 2 in "F"∗ and does not contain −1, then "S" defines a ordering on "F". An equivalent definition is that "F" is a formally real field in which the set of squares forms a fan. A superpythagorean field is necessarily Pythagorean.
The analogue of the Diller–Dress theorem holds: if "E"/"F" is a finite extension and "E" is superpythagorean then so is "F". In the opposite direction, if "F" is superpythagorean and "E" is a formally real field containing "F" and contained in the quadratic closure of "F" then "E" is superpythagorean.

Annunciation Monastery (Tolyatti)

The Annunciation Monastery () is a church complex in the village of Fedorovka in the urban district of Tolyatti in Samara Oblast in Russia.
History.
Founding.
Barbara Bakhmetev (née Lopukhin) was the lifelong love of the poet Mikhail Lermontov and the inspiration for some of his works, but the pair was not allowed to marry. Instead, Barbara was married to the wealthy landowner and master of Fedorovka, Nikolai Fedorovich Bakhmetev. Barbara was never happy or well after her marriage, and fell more deeply ill after the death of Lermontov in 1841.
In 1846 Nikolai Bakhmetev constructed a stone church, the altar which was dedicated in honor of St. Barbara, in hope of a cure for his wife. This was the first building of what would become the Annunciation Monastery. The first priest of the church was Alexander Kornilievich Yastrebov. Barbara Bakhmetev died in 1851 at the age of 36.
In 1871, Peter Flerinsky was baptized in the church. Flerinsky later became Bishop Paul, a leader of the Orthodox Church in early Soviet times (and sometime prisoner of the Soviets).
Deconsecration and renewal.
On March 6, 1930, the church bells were removed. The church, like many others in the diocese, was closed, and the property seized by the state. The building was used as a recreation center, and later as a shop.
In the late 1980s the building was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Restoration was undertaken, and the church was replastered and painted. The floor was paved with marble, and a new iconostasis was installed. The restoration was undertaken by a group of artists led by the People's Artist of the USSR and USSR State Prize laureate Andrei Vasnetsov and the Central Research and Design Institute of Residential and Public Buildings architect E. Ioheles.
On May 19, 1989, the church was reopened. Nicholas Manihin, provost of the Stavropol region of Samara diocese, consecrated the church in honor of the Annunciation. The first rector of the restored church was Archpriest Vladimir Novichkov (Father Gregory). One of the icons saved by a believer when the church was seized in 1930 was returned for the rebirth of the church.
In 1990, construction began close to the Annunciation Church of the monastery complex, which included a refectory, another church in honor of St. Barbara, ten monastic cells, and outbuildings.
Architectural features.
The church has a triangular pediment. From under the cornices protrude kokoshniks (an architectural feature, peculiar to Russia, of semicircular decorative elements at the end of the outer section of a wall, which takes its name from that of a traditional Russian woman's headdress, "Kokoshnik"). The church is crowned with five golden domes (originally blue, these were later gold-plated).
The Annunciation Church building is officially recognized as an architectural monument of Tolyatti. Because the city was completely relocated when the Kuybyshev dam was built in the 1950s, it is now the oldest building surviving in Tolyatti.
The monastery is located directly on the shores of the Volga, and clearly visible from ships sailing the river.

<doc id="31032850" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31032850" title="Operation Safe Homecoming">
Operation Safe Homecoming

Operation Safe Homecoming was an operation launched by India to evacuate its nationals, who were fleeing from the Libyan civil war. It was a combination of an air and sea-bridge which was to be conducted by the Indian Navy and Air India. The last time the Indian government had launched such an evacuation was during the 2006 Lebanon War when the Indian Navy and Air India were used under Operation Sukoon. Prior to this, India had evacuated 111,711 of its nationals after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Prelude.
The Libyan civil war began as a series of protests and confrontations occurring in the North African state of Libya against the government and its leader Muammar Gaddafi. The social unrest began on 15 February 2011 and has since become a civil war that continued until 23 October 2011. Inspiration for the unrest is attributed to the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, connecting it with the wider Arab Spring. According to Richard Engel, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, who entered Libya and had reached the city of Tobruk on 22 February, "the protest movement is no longer a protest movement, it's a war. It's open revolt." On 22 February, "The Economist" described the events as an "uprising that is trying to reclaim Libya from the world's longest-ruling autocrat." Gaddafi blamed the uprising on al-Qaeda and "drugged kids".
The Operation.
There were 18,000 Indian nationals working in Libya who were trapped because of the unrest. Evacuation appeared to be difficult due to "chaos" at the central airport in Tripoli as well as a "destroyed" runway at Benina International Airport and the temporary closure of all Libyan ports. Consequently, many international flights, including those of British Airways, were cancelled, although others appeared to operate. Further reports indicate that Libyan harbours in many cities were closed.
India therefore ordered three Indian Navy ships, two destroyers the INS "Mysore", and "INS Aditya" along with its largest amphibious vessel, INS "Jalashwa" to sail from Mumbai on 26 February to Libya. It also chartered the 1,200-seater "MV Scotia Prince" and the 1,600 seater "La Superba", based in Sicily to sail to Libya as soon as port preparations were completed. The "MV Scotia Prince" set sail from Port Said on 26 February and reached Benghazi on 28 February. The navy and charter ships evacuated passengers from Tripoli and Benghazi to Alexandria, Egypt, from there Air India aircraft flew the passengers to India. The navy ships reached the Libya coast by 8 March 2011, but they were not used since much of the evacuation had already been carried out by chartered ships and aircraft. The Indian Government announced that evacuation will not cost anything to its nationals.
After Libyan authorities gave India permission to land in Tripoli, two Air India aircraft, a Boeing 747 and an Airbus 330, flew 500 passengers directly to New Delhi and Mumbai from Tripoli. Additional landing rights were requested for operating flights from Sabha, where about 1,000 of its nationals were awaiting evacuation. Additionally India was given permission to land its aircraft at Sirte and Sabha where there were 2,000 Indians awaiting evacuation. Additionally, on 2 March, the Indian Government ordered all private airlines to fly one flight each to Libya, two airlines Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines started flying from 3 March, they flew Indian nationals ferried to Malta from the airport at Luqa. On 3 March, an Il-76 aircraft of the Indian Air Force was pressed into service to fly out the Indians to Cairo from Sirte. 
Several Indian nationals were crossing Libya into neighbouring countries via the land route. Some of them reached Salloum, Egypt from Tobruk and were met at the border by Indian embassy officials who arranged their onward journey to Mumbai on an international airline. Similarly 88 nationals crossed over via Ras Ajdir into Tunisia.
Aftermath.
On 5 March 2011, the Indian government announced that the evacuation would be completed by 10 March. After the evacuation of more than 15,000 of its nationals, the operation wened on 11 March. About 3,000 of its nationals decided to stay in Libya.

French Camp Academy

French Camp Academy (FCA) is an interdenominational Christian boarding home and academy in French Camp, Mississippi. It is intended to serve children who live in troubled households. The school operates several businesses in French Camp, including a bed and breakfast, a gift shop, and a restaurant.
History.
A group of Scotch-Irish Christians, under the area Presbyterian Church, established the The Central Mississippi Institute for Girls in 1885. The French Camp Academy for Boys opened later in 1885. The school was intended for children of Native Americans and White settlers who lived in the French Camp area. In 1915 a fire destroyed the girls' school; both the schools for boys and girls combined as the French Camp Academy. In 1950 the school was reorganized under a board of trustees, which represented various Christian denominations.
Location and composition.
French Camp Academy is in French Camp, a community in central Mississippi, south of Tupelo and north of Jackson. The school has a total of of land.
The school hosts the Rainwater Observatory and Planetarium, the largest planetary observatory in Mississippi. The observatory, with 16 telescopes, has a clear view of outer space since it is far from major cities, which are sources of light pollution. The observatory is open by appointment to members of the public.
Education.
Students in grades 7 - 12 attend French Camp Academy's in-house school. Students are required to wear school uniforms. High school students may attend a vocational technology program in the Choctaw Vocational Center in Ackerman.
Businesses.
French Camp operates the Council House Café, a restaurant, in a by log cabin that was built in 1820 and once served as a meeting place for Greenwood LeFlore. The school received the building as a donation in 1967. As part of a bicentennial project of students and staff, the log cabin was restored. The Council House serves sandwiches, salads, soups, bread pudding, and Mississippi mud pie. The school uses the restaurant as a training area for students, and the profits from the restaurant fund scholarships for students.
French Camp operates a bed and breakfast hotel. In 1986 the school moved two clerestory log cabins from Eupora, Mississippi to French Camp. The cabins, which had been constructed between 1840 and 1860, were placed together and the school established an addition between the cabins. The addition was designed to have the same historic appearance that the original cabins have. The hotel opened in March 1987. In 1990 the school restored an additional cottage, named the B & B Jr., and placed it behind the main building. Carriage House is a building of newer construction which sits on the former location of an 1880s cabin. Another cabin, the Burford Cabin, is the most newly opened accommodation building within the bed and breakfast. The Buford Cabin is accessible for handicapped people. The main building can accommodate up to eight people. The B & B Jr. can accommodate up to six people, the Burford Cabin can house up to four people, and the Carriage House can accommodate up to six people.
WFCA.
French Camp Academy hosts the WFCA radio station, a non-profit radio station with its studios located along the Natchez Trace Parkway at Mile Marker 181. H. Richard Cannon, president of the school, conceived of the idea of the radio station while taking a mission field trip in New Guinea.
Festivals.
The French Camp village harvest festival, held annually every second Saturday of October, has its proceeds benefiting the school.
Demographics.
As of 2000 the school had about 300 student residents. As of 2011 about 300 children and adults live and work on the campus.

Summers v. Adams

Summers v. Adams, was a case where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that South Carolina's law, the "I Believe" Act, was deemed unconstitutional for violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The law authorized the state's Department of Motor Vehicles to create a licence plate that had to contain "the words 'I Believe' and a cross superimposed on a stain glass window."
Facts.
Genesis of the "I Believe" Act.
South Carolina law allows for organizations to file for customized licence plates that can be sold statewide. After an unsuccessful attempt at implementing a similar license plate in Florida, former Lieutenant Governor André Bauer proposed the "I Believe" Act with State Senator Yancey McGill. On April 24, 2008, the act was introduced to the Senate and by May 21, 2008 the bill had been passed unanimously through both the Senate and the House. 
The "I Believe" Act Reads as follow:
The Department of Motor Vehicles may issue "I Believe” special motor vehicle
license plates to owners of private motor vehicles registered in their names. The plate
must contain the words “I Believe” and a cross superimposed on a stained glass
window. The biennial fee for this special license plate is the same as the fee provided
in Article 5, Chapter 3 of this title. The guidelines for the production of this special
license plate must meet the requirements contained in Section 56-3-8100. 
On June 5, 2008, the aforementioned act became law without the signature of former Governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford.
The Department of Motor Vehicles debuted the new license plate on their website on October 30, 2008 and began taking orders from residents. Three days later they had over four-hundred prepaid applications for the "I Believe" plate, allowing them to begin production, but that November the plaintiffs, four religious leaders and two non-profit religious-cultural organizations, filed for preliminary injunction and successfully stalled production of the plates on December 11, 2008.
Issues.
Plaintiffs.
The Plaintiffs included: Rev. Dr. Thomas A. Summers, Rev. Robert M. Knight, Rabbi Sanford T. Marcus, Rev. Dr. Neal Jones, Hindu American Foundation, and American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
The plaintiffs opposed the "I Believe" Act on two grounds:
However, when the courts doubted whether or not the plaintiffs had standing on the second accusation, they dismissed the second argument and chose to just focus solely on the violation of the Establishment Clause.
Defendants.
The defendant and the Director of the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, Marcia S. Adams, considered the proposed license plate's purpose a secular one. She argued that the plate was to "provide South Carolina motorist with another message that they can electo to convey when selecting from over one hundred available special license plates." She notes that the "I Believe" plate provided an alternative to the "In Reason We Trust" plate (Which was a secular take of the phrase "In God We Trust").
The former Attorney General of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, argued another position when he gave his amicus curiae brief. He described it as “than being motivated by a secular purpose, the [‘I Believe' Act is instead an accommodation to Christians, just as the other plates are accommodations to Parrot Heads and fraternity and sorority members.” 
Opinion of the Court.
Ruling with respect of stare decisis, the appellate court went of precedents set in the United States Supreme Court's decision of Lemon v. Kurtzman. The "I Believe" Act's constitutionality was decided by being held up to the Lemon Test. The three prongs of the Lemon Test are:
First, the court ruled that the "I Believe" Act was not intended to serve a secular purpose. Instead of making it easier for all groups to get custom plates, the bill only allowed "I Believe" to be backed by a cross and stained glass window. That caused the plate to be "uniquely Christian". The fact that the plate idea was not initiated by any group or organization, but by the Lieutenant Governor André Bauer, allowed the court to quickly rule that the government's action did not have a secular purpose.
For the second prong, the test requires that the primary effect of the action must not advance or inhibit religion. The court ruled that the act's primary effect "was" promoting a specific religion, Christianity. Because Christianity is the only religion represented, it "signals" that it's the preferred religion. Quoting Wallace v. Jaffree, the Establishment Clause "preclude government from conveying or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is "favored or preferred"."
The last prong included in the Lemon Test forbids "excessive government entanglement" with religion. The court found that the "I Believe" Act also failed the final prong. The court saw the state's decision to use Christian symbols on a government-sponsored license plate the first sign of entanglement. Adopting one religious belief will cause the legislature to vote and decide what other beliefs are "worthy", they say that as an even greater risk of entanglement. When the, then Lieutenant Governor, André Bauer and former Attorney General of South Carolina Henry McMaster went around the state speaking at church rallies in support of the "I Believe" Act, they not only caused further entanglement, but also went back on the decision in Newdow v. United States Congress, Elk Grove Unified School District, et al.. The decision that stated the “the essential command of the Establishment Clause... that government not make a person’s religious beliefs relevant to his or her standing in the political community by conveying a message ‘that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.’”

Döhlen Basin

The Döhlen Basin () is a landscape unit in the German federal state of Saxony, southwest of Dresden. The Döhlen Basin has a length of 22 km and a width of 6 km and lies within the district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge.
Description.
In the centre of the basin is the large county town of Freital; although the basin is named after Döhlen, one of the villages in its borough. The highest point in the area is the Lerchenberg near Possendorf at 425 m above sea level (NN); the lowest point is in the river valley of the Weißeritz at 160 m above NN. The Karsdorf fault forms the geological boundary with the Eastern Ore Mountains to the south.
The formation and sedimentation of the basin lasted from Upper Carboniferous to the Lower Permian and were tectonically affected by the adjacent NW-SE trending fault zone (the Elbe Valley zone). About half of the 800-metre-thick basin filling is made of pyroclastic rock. Of economic importance were the coal seams of the Döhlen formation, whose occurrence has been known since the 16th century and particularly in the late 19th and early 20th century was the reason for an intensive mining industry. From 1968, mining activity became restricted to the extraction of uranium-bearing coal on the northwest edge of the Döhlen Basin by SDAG Wismut. Since 1989, the surface and underground facilities in the region have been safeguarded and sanitised.

Minto Stone

The Minto Stone or Stone of Sangguran, known in Indonesia as Prasasti Sanggurah, is a , tall stone tablet found in Malang, East Java province. In 1812, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then lieutenant-governor of the island of Java, removed it along with the so-called "Calcutta Stone" as a token of appreciation to his superior, then British Governor General of India, Lord Minto. It consequently became part of the Minto family estate near Hawick, Roxburghshire, Scotland.
The inscribed stone is dated to 982 AD and mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (Wijayaloka), who then ruled the Malang area. According to Indonesian historians, the stone is an important artifact and a crucial source of information. It contains elements about the Mataram Kingdom in Central Java and the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.
Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga is better known in Indonesia as Dyah Wawa (r. 924—929). He was the last ruler of Mataram. His successor, Mpu Sindok (r. 929—947), moved the court from Central Java to East Java in 929. The reasons for this move are still unclear.
Demands for the repatriation of the stone from Scotland, back to Java, Indonesia have been made since 2004.

William Tong (minister)

William Tong (1662–1727) was an English Presbyterian minister, at the heart of the subscription debate of 1718.
Life.
He was born on 24 June 1662, probably at Eccles near Manchester, where his father (a relative of Robert Warton Hall) was buried. His mother was early left a widow with three children. Tong began his education with a view to the law, but his mother's influence turned him to the ministry. He entered the Rathmell Academy of Richard Frankland, then at Natland, on 2 March 1681, and was Frankland's most distinguished student. 
Early in 1685 he was licensed to preach. For two years he acted as chaplain in Shropshire to Thomas Corbet of Stanwardine and Rowland Hunt of Boreatton, becoming acquainted with Philip Henry. Until threatened with prosecution, he preached occasionally at the chapel of Cockshut, in the parish of Ellesmere. At the beginning of March 1687 he took a three months' engagement at Chester, pending the arrival of Matthew Henry. His services were conducted, noon and night, in the house of Anthony Henthorn; and were so successful that they were then transferred to a large outbuilding.
From Chester he was called to be the first pastor of a newly formed dissenting congregation at Knutsford, Cheshire. He was ordained on 4 November 1687, and procured the building of the existing meeting-house in Brook Street (opened 1688–9). On the deaths (22 October 1689) of Obadiah Grew, and Jarvis Bryan (27 December 1689), he was called to be co-pastor with Thomas Shewell (died 19 Jan. 1693) at the Great Meeting-house, Coventry. Here he ministered for nearly thirteen years from 1690. He had as colleagues, after Shewell, Joshua Oldfield and John Warren (died 15 September 1742). He escaped the prosecutions which were brought against Oldfield, though he assisted him in academy teaching, and the bursaries from the presbyterian fund were paid through him. 
On the death of Nathaniel Taylor (April 1702), after overtures had been made to Josiah Chorley and Matthew Henry, Tong was elected pastor of the presbyterian congregation in Salters' Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, John Newman (1677?–1741) being retained as his assistant. The congregation was large, and the most wealthy among London dissenters. The central position of its meeting-house made it convenient for lectures and for joint meetings of dissenters. Tong was soon elected to succeed John Howe as one of the four preachers of the ‘merchants' lecture’ on Tuesday mornings at Salters' Hall. 
He took a prominent part in the controversy arising out of the alleged heresies of James Peirce of Exeter. His steps were cautious. An undated letter of March or April 1718 by Thomas Secker mentions that on a proposal in the presbyterian fund to increase the grant to Hubert Stogdon, Tong ‘was silent for some time and then went out’. On 25 August 1718 a conference of twenty-five presbyterian and independent ministers, with Benjamin Robinson as moderator, was held at Salters' Hall. They endorsed a letter (drafted by Tong) to John Walrond (died 1755), minister of Ottery St Mary, Devon, affirming that they would not ordain any candidates unsound on the Trinity. In the conferences of the following year, ending in a rupture, Tong was a leader of the subscribing party . His introduction to ‘The Doctrine of the … Trinity stated and defended … by four subscribing Ministers,’ 1719, puts his case. 
As one of the original trustees of the foundations of Daniel Williams, Tong had, from 1721, a share in the task of carrying these benefactions into effect. He was also one of the first distributors (1723) of the English "regium donum", and a trustee (1726) of the Barnes bequest. In his last years his powers declined. His end was rather sudden. He died on 21 March 1727.
Works.
His major works are his contributions to nonconformist history:
His published sermons include funeral sermons for Samuel Slater and Elizabeth Bury. He revised Matthew Henry's ‘Memoirs’ of Philip Henry, 1698, and prepared the expositions of Hebrews and Revelation for Matthew Henry's ‘Commentary.’

Scior Carera

Scior Carera (Milanese for "Mister Carera") and Omm de preja (Milanese for "stone man") are traditional, popular names used to refer to an ancient Roman sculpture located in Milan (Italy), at nr. 13 of Corso Vittorio Emanuele (next to the Duomo). Before being located where it is now (on the facade of a modern building) in the mid 20th century, the sculpture has been in different places, most notably in Via San Pietro dall'Orto.
The name "Carera" is a corruption of the first word "Carere" of the epigraph found below the statue.
The sculpture is a marble bas-relief dating back to the 3rd century. It depicts a man wearing a "toga", with the right leg slightly put forward; it has lost its arms as well as its head. The latter was replaced in the middle ages, supposedly to represent archbishop Adelmanno Menclozzi.
Under the relief there is an epigraph with a sentence credited to Cicero, "Carere debet omni vitio qui in alterum dicere paratus est" ("Anybody who wants to criticise someone should be free from all faults"). Another inscription below this one remembers the former collocation of the statue in Via San Pietro all'Orto as well as the role this statue has played in the 19th century during the Austrian rule of Milan; at the time, in fact, there was the common habit of attaching satirical political messages to the statue, much like what happened in Rome with Pasquino and other "talking statues". In particular, the so-called tobacco riots that started the Five Days of Milan (whereby the Milanese quit smoking to cause an economical damage to the Austrian) was possibly initiated on 31 December 1848 by a message attached to Scior Carera. 
Because of the role of the statue in the fight for independence of Milan, its name was used for a satirical journal ("L'uomo di pietra", Italian equivalent of "Omm de preja") that was published between 1856 and 1864 and again after 1878.

Modra Hvezda Dobrany is a small, independent brewery in Dobřany near Plzen in the Czech Republic.
Beer has been brewed in Dobrany since 1378. The brewery reopened in 1998 under the guiding hand of Jaroslav Franek who worked in the Pilsner brewery until he decided to try his own hand.
Jaroslav Franek was not the first in Dobřany who tried to open a brewery. Beer has been brewed here since the First Republic. "My grandfather always said that Dobřany beer was better than a Pilsner," he said Franek. When the Second World War began, the brewery was closed in Dobřany. An attempt to reopen it after pětačtyřicátém failed. And so again, Dobřany beer brewing began in 1994 when Franek bought a house in the square and built a restaurant with a small brewery. Equipment was supplied by Pacovske engineering works. The capacity of the brewery was 1 000 hl per year.
"Before the war it operated Blue Star restaurants. We said that we will not be renamed again," the brewer recalled. The old house was renovated now keeps the traditional look.
The water in used in the beer is considered by many to be even better than that in Plzen.

Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)

Titan is the project name for a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) being developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Speculation regarding the game began in 2007. The company has revealed little information about the game besides that it is completely new, not based on the company's three main franchises. In May 2013 the development process for the game was rebooted, as Blizzard decided to go in a different direction with the game.
Development.
In 2007, users on a Blizzard Internet forum speculated that the game was in development after the company published job listings for character and environment artists to work on a "Next-Gen MMO" that was "Top Secret." A Blizzard community representative confirmed that the postings were for an unannounced game that was not an expansion for "World of Warcraft". Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, Blizzard COO Paul Sams, and Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime all verified that it was a new game in 2008. A confidential project schedule was released without the company's consent in November 2010. It showed a project titled ""Titan"" with a release date in the fourth quarter of 2013. Blizzard China's general manager either resigned or was terminated after the leak.
At the 2010 "Spike Video Game Awards", Blizzard co-founder Frank Pearce told gaming blog Destructoid that the studio had begun talking about the title as a recruitment tool. Morhaime spoke of the game in broad terms during a panel discussion at the 2011 D.I.C.E. Summit. He said that the company had its most experienced MMO developers working on the project. He explained that they were using lessons from the years of working on "World of Warcraft", and he also emphasized the significance of players gaming with people they know as opposed to strangers. Morhaime believes that "World of Warcraft" and "Titan", upon its release, will be able to co-exist on the market. He had made a similar statement in 2008 when he told "Wired" magazine that the game would be so different that it would not compete.
In an interview with Gamasutra in March 2011, Sams revealed that the game was playable and laid out a vision for the project to "still be growing strong" in ten, fifteen or twenty years, having "set a new mark in the industry." By September 2012, development had grown from small teams focusing on concepts to a team of over 100 people and Blizzard vice president of game design Rob Pardo said that the game was "in the middle of development", noting that it was a "very big project that's got a long ways to go".
On May 28, 2013, it was reported that development on the project had been essentially rebooted, with seventy percent of the team moving to other Blizzard projects and the release date delayed. Blizzard spokesperson Shon Damron confirmed the development status, stating that the remaining core developers would be working to accommodate new technology into the game.
In August 2013, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime stated that the company is in the process of selecting a new direction for the project, and re-envisioning what they want the game to be. He said that the game was "unlikely to be a subscription-based MMORPG", and that there were no official announced or projected release dates. While "Titan" is being reassessed, team members were shifted to other Blizzard projects, including "World of Warcraft" and "Heroes of the Storm". Morhaime noted that Blizzard has gone through this sort of iterative development process with previous games.

Rofla Gorge

The Rofla Gorge ( or "Rofflaschlucht" as on the nearby guest house) is an ancient and narrow section of the Hinterrhein river between Sufers and Andeer in the Canton of Graubünden. This narrow gorge was another obstacle on the approach to the two mountain passes Splügen Pass und San Bernardino Pass in addition to the Viamala gorge.
Modern era.
Nowadays the mountains can be crossed on the A13 motorway, opened in 1967, which passes through the San Bernardino Tunnel and is therefore open all year round (whereas both passes were closed in winter). The older, main road passes the hotel at the entrance of the gorge, from where there is a footpath to and under the waterfall. The path was built from 1907 to 1914 by the family who owned the hotel.

Thomas Smith (English judge)

Sir Thomas Smith (1556?–1609), was the English master of requests.
Family and identity.
Smith was born at Abingdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), about 1556. He was the son of Thomas Smith, who is almost certainly to be identified with the Thomas Smith who was Mayor of Abingdon in 1584. He must be distinguished from Sir Thomas Smith or Smythe (1558?–1625), governor of the East India Company, and from the latter's father, Thomas Smythe (d. 1591), "customer" of the port of London.
Education.
He was educated at Abingdon Grammar School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was elected student in 1573, graduated B.A. in December 1574, and M.A. in June 1578. He was chosen public orator on 9 April 1582, and proctor on 29 April 1584.
Career.
Soon afterwards he became secretary to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, and in 1587 was appointed clerk of the privy council. In December 1591 he wrote to Cecil urging Essex's claims to the chancellorship of Oxford University. He represented Cricklade in the parliament of 1588–9, Tamworth in that of 1593, and Aylesbury in that of 1597–8. On 30 September 1597 he received a grant of the clerkship of parliament, in succession to Anthony Wyckes, alias Mason. He kept aloof from Essex's intrigues, and on 29 November 1599 was sent by the lords to summon the earl before the privy council. On the accession of James I he received further promotion, perhaps owing to his friendship with Carleton, Edmondes, Winwood, and Bacon. He was knighted at Greenwich on 20 May 1603, and in the following month was granted the Latin secretaryship for life, and the reversion to the secretaryship of the council of the north. On 8 June 1604 he obtained the manor of Wing, Rutland, and in 1608 he was made master of requests. On 20 May in the same year he received a pension of £100.
Death and descendants.
He died on 27 November 1609 at his residence (afterwards called Peterborough House) at Parsons Green, near Fulham, in Middlesex and was buried on 7 December in the chancel of Fulham parish church, where a monument, with an inscription to his memory, is extant. He married Frances (1580–1663), daughter of William Brydges, fourth baron Chandos, and sister of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos. His only son, Robert, died a minor, and his only daughter, Margaret, married Thomas, second son of Robert Carey, first earl of Monmouth. Smith's widow married Thomas Cecil, first earl of Exeter, and survived till 1663. By his will, dated 12 September 1609, Smith left £100 to the poor of Abingdon, and a similar sum to the Bodleian Library.

Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga, better known in Indonesia as Dyah Wawa, was the last ruler of the Mataram Kingdom in Central Java, Indonesia (r. 924—929). What is known of him is mainly thanks to an inscription engraved on the so-called "Minto Stone".
Wawa's son-in-law and successor, Mpu Sindok (r. 929—947), moved the court of Mataram from Central Java to East Java in 929. The latter could have buried the former at Belahan Temple near Pasuruan in East Java.

Ron Gibbs

Ron Gibbs (born 14 April 1962 in Brewarrina, New South Wales) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played professionally in Australia and England. An Australian Aboriginal and Country New South Wales representative three-quarter back or second-row forward, he played his club football in the New South Wales Rugby League for Eastern Suburbs, Manly-Warringah (with whom he won the 1987 NSWRL Premiership), Gold Coast-Tweed and Western Suburbs, as well as in England for Castleford.
Playing career.
In 1982 Gibbs, nicknamed “Rambo” for his fearless runs at the defensive line, scored three tries for the Western Suburbs Rosellas as they defeated Kurri Kurri to win the Newcastle Rugby League Grand Final 21-14 at the Newcastle International Sports Centre.
Gibbs made his NSWRL Premiership debut for Eastern Suburbs in 1983 against Illawarra. He was the club’s captain in 1984 and 1985 before handing the job over to John Tobin.
He joined the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah in 1986 and played in 47 games for the club, including the winning 1987 Grand Final against Canberra in the last Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1987 he also represented New South Wales Country in the annual City v Country match. His last game for the club was the 1987 World Club Challenge at Central Park in Wigan, England. Gibbs became the first player sent off in a World Club Challenge following a high tackle on Wigan centre Joe Lydon. Wigan won a try-less game 8-2 in front of 36,895 fans.
"Rambo never cared if you were with him or against him . . . get in his way and you copped it." -Chris Close " 
In 1988 he joined the new Gold Coast-Tweed club as their key signing, although he missed their opening six matches and according to observers “produced his rampaging best only rarely”. He spent the 1988-89 off-season in England, playing for the Castleford Tigers. In 1989 Gibbs again represented NSW Country and was made the Giants captain. In 1990 Gibbs again played for both Gold Coast-Tweed and Castleford. He also represented the Australian Aboriginal side in the 1990 Pacific Cup.
During the 1990/1991 off-season, Gibbs negotiated with Wests, who had acquired a number of class players and were looking at their first finals series since 1982, but was drafted by wooden spooner South Sydney. Gibbs refused to play for South Sydney, but despite the Rabbitohs’ refusal to let go of him, his court appeal was won with a unanimous vote on the twelfth of March, 1991. Gibbs’ victory stands in contrast to the better-known turning down of identical appeals by Terry Hill and Emosi Koloto. Gibbs spent only one season with the Magpies before retiring.
Gibbs later said of his many games, “I would have been concussed in over half of them. On some of the little concussions when I got smashed I had nausea, felt like spewing, I was light-headed and you do lose your sense of balance, all of that, it all comes with it. As soon as I’d got into the next tackle my body would just click back into gear, sort of like driving a manual car. I'm sure there is after-effects. But I loved every minute of it. I’d do it all over again.”

Papel Prensa

Papel Prensa is the largest Argentine manufacturer of newsprint, furnishing 58% of the local market in the staple. The public–private partnership became the focus of one of a series of controversies between Clarín and Kirchnerism (the ruling Argentine political faction) in 2010.
Establishment.
"Papel Prensa" ("Press Paper") originated in the establishment of the Paper and Cellulose Production Development Fund in 1969 by de facto President Juan Carlos Onganía. The plan envisaged the establishment of a public-private newsprint manufacturing facility that could substitute imports of the staple, which excluding "Papelera Tucumán", accounted for practically the entire annual demand of over 340,000 metric tons; the nation's 179 news dailies had a combined circulation of nearly 4.3 million in 1970, the second-largest in Latin America, and the highest on a per capita basis.
The fund stipulated the enactment of a 10% excise tax on all imported newsprint for a ten-year priod, during which the state would retain a share in the company. A bidding process was launched in 1971 for the plant's development, though none met capacity requirements, and its construction was assigned to the Ministry of Industry. The company itself was formally established on July 12, 1972, with a 27% ownership by the state, and the remainder by a consortium led by publisher César Civita and the company he directed, Editorial Abril.
David Graiver.
Civita and Editorial Abril sold their shares in late 1973 to a consortium led by banker and developer David Graiver who, through partner Rafael Ianover, became the firm's largest private shareholder. Secretly, however, Graiver acted as the investment banker for the Montoneros guerrilla group. He reportedly laundered US$17 million in funds that the Montoneros had received from illicit activities, principally kidnapping. These investments included a variety of interests in both Argentina and overseas, and by 1976, Graiver owned a significant stake in Jacobo Timerman's "La Opinión" (one of the leading newspapers and the leading magazine publisher in Argentina), as well as numeous other businesses and banks in Argentina, New York, and elsewhere. Graiver contracted US$67 million in debts, however, and reportedly died in a plane crash near Acapulco on August 7, 1976. He was indicted for embezzlement in 1978 by Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau, who believed the elusive banker to possibly be alive.
Sale and controversy.
His widow, Lidia Papaleo, returned to Argentina on September 16, and was enjoined by the newly installed dictatorship to sell her family's stake in Papel Prensa, as was Ianover. She was also coerced by the Montoneros, who sought to recover the US$17 million investment managed by Graiver. A military tribunal sentenced Papaleo and Graiver's brother and father to 15 years' imprisonment, though an appeals court later cleared the defendants of all charges.
Papaleo and the other private partners negotiated the sale of their shares on November 2 with the three most important Argentine newspaper publishers at the time ("Clarín", "La Nación", and "La Razón"). Papaleo, however, had collected but U$S 7,000 when, on March 14, 1977, she was illegally detained by the Buenos Aires Province Police. Papel Prensa, which at the time was not operational, received a significant injection of capital during a period of state receivership that ended in January 1978, and on September 27, its San Pedro facility was inaugurated, substituting around US$90 million annually in newsprint imports. The private shareholders of Papel Prensa, including Graiver's widow, were ultimately indemnified by President Raúl Alfonsín's administration in 1985.
The Clarín Media Group acquired "La Razón" and its corrponding shares in Papel Prensa in 2000, raising its stake to 49 percent; the Argentine government maintained its 27.5% share. Clarín and La Nación together accounted for 71% of the company's sales in 2011. Newspaper circulation declined in Argentina after the 1970s, but production at Papel Prensa remained below local market needs for the nation's 170 dailies and newsprint imports remained at around 80,000 tons annually in 2011. Production at Papel Prensa, moreover, continued to decline. The San Pedro facility produced 170,000 tons of newsprint (75% of the Argentine market) in 2009, and 145,000 tons (58% of the market) by 2011.
Renewed accusations.
Amid a series of political controversies between Clarín and Kirchnerism, Papaleo testified in 2010 to having been personally threatened by "Clarín" executive Héctor Magnetto during the sale, and subsequently tortured by police to forfeit further payment, as well as her remaining shares in "La Opinión". Charges were filed to the effect of the sale's alleged illegality by the federal government in August 2010, a decision the company's directors claimed was a government attempt to control the still-significant newspaper media. Papaleo, however, recanted her testimony within days, affirming simply that she had been pressured to sell her shares, though never under duress. This latter assertion was echoed by Isidoro Graiver (her brother-in-law) and by María Sol Graiver (the couple's daughter). Her brother, Osvaldo Papaleo, reiterated claims that the sale of Graiver's Papel Prensa shares was arranged under pain of death, and that ulterior motives explained the recent retractions. 
A joint declaration by Clarín and La Nación dismissed these reports, pointing out that the kidnappings and the Papel Prensa sale had already been investigated after the restoration of democracy in 1983. The courts at the time found no link between the Gravier kidnapping and the sale, nor any irregularities in the sale itself. Lidia and Osvaldo Papaleo and Rafael Ianover testified in court at the time regarding the abuses made against them by the dictatorship, and did not report any of the incidents they reported in 2010. Bartolomé Mitre (director of La Nación) and Héctor Magnetto (CEO of Clarín) accused the Secretary of Human Rights of tampering with the 1988 judicial ruling, adding new lines absent in the original copy to suggest favoritism by the Junta for the benefit of their newspapers. A line in the original document, for instance, that said ""The problem with the price, however, is intrascendent to the scope of this body, and besides, it was accepted by the sellers -The Gravier Group- and has only been mentioned to prove the hurry to negotiate"" was claimed by Mitre and Magnetto to have been amended by surreptitiously turning a period into a comma, and by adding ""and the existence of a single buyer imposed or chosen by the national authorities."" 
These controversies coincided with a highly politicized six-month work stoppage at the San Pedro plant amid accusations of abnormnally high pay for managerial staff. The strike ended following wage increases agreed to in early December.
Expropriation bill.
The FPV won the 2011 election by a wide margin, and obtained a majority of both houses of Congress. With this majority, the FPV presented a bill to expropriate the company from Clarín and La Nación, by declaring the production and distribution of newsprint of national interest. This would allow the government to increase their holdings of company stock, purchasing a majority stake and thus the control of Papel Prensa; the bill aims to regulate the import of paper as well. The bill was rejected by all the other parties, which alleged it was unconstitutional and had the aim of imposing indirect limits on freedom of the press.

Thorndon Railway Station

Thorndon Railway Station in Wellington, New Zealand was opened in 1885 as the southern terminus of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company’s Wellington-Manawatu Line. This line is now part of the Kapiti section of the North Island Main Trunk. 
The station had one side platform, and was lit by electricity. It was off Thorndon Quay just north of Davis Street, and once had a tramway stop. 
The station was the main terminus for the WMR, so had a goods yard, engine shed, workshop and maintenance facilities. It was built on reclaimed land. The company was allocated 19 of the 30 acres of reclamation, made with spoil from the tunnels. 
Passenger trains were run to the Longburn terminus, and also local trains via Johnsonville to Porirua or Paekakariki. By 1908 there were seven local trains each way on weekdays and Saturdays, and one each way on Sunday. 
History.
The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) was established in 1881 to build the second or West Coast line out of Wellington after the new Government decided to postpone the project. The line was opened to Plimmerton in October 1885 and to the Longburn terminus in November 1886. The WMR had planned to share the two terminal stations at Wellington and Longburn with the New Zealand Railways Department, but because of government procrastination had to build its own stations. Thorndon station was built in 1883, but was not put into use until 1885 (Churchman). 
The Government took over the WMR in December 1908, but retained two adjacent stations in Wellington, Thorndon and Lambton until June 1937 when the new Wellington Railway Station was opened. Thorndon closed on 8 June.

Italian destroyer Caio Duilio (D 554)

Caio Duilio is a destroyer of the Italian Navy. She and her sister form the "Andrea Doria" class; in turn these two ships, and the French vessels and , belong to the . "Caio Duilio "is marked by hull number D554 according to NATO classification.
History.
Background.
The ship takes her name from the 3rd century BC Roman leader and admiral Gaius Duilius ("Caio Duilio" in Italian). Duilius ordered the construction of 120 ships that were armed with hooked bridges called corvus, Latin for “crow”. This innovation allowed the Romans to defeat the powerful enemy fleet of Carthage transforming the naval battle into a melee combat.
After the victory over the Carthaginians at the Battle of Mylae in 260 BC, Duilius was honored with a triumphal parade and the erection in the Roman Forum of a column adorned with the beaks of captured Carthaginian warships; column that became his symbol and that appears today in the coat of arms of the ship.
The destroyer "Caio Duilio" is the fourth Italian warship with this historical name. The first, the ironclad , was commissioned in 1886 and served until 1909. Fitted with the largest guns available, 100-ton 450 mm calibre muzzle-loading guns, she was regarded as the most powerful warship afloat in their day. The second unit, the , was commissioned on 24 April 1913 and subsequently was refitted in 1937, serving in the Regia Marina during World War I and World War II; while the third, the missile cruiser , was commissioned in 1960 and served until 1990 during the Cold War. "Caio Duilio" was launched on October 23, 2007 and transported in Muggiano shipyard on October 29 for the mounting of the combat system.
"Caio Duilio"s motto refers to the ancient Roman tradition, in which the name acquires religious connotations. Some ancient fragments point up this intimate meaning. "Nomen Numen" can be translated as "the name means power".
Career.
On February 12, 2008 she made the first sea trial and, after the admission into military fleet which took place on April 3, 2009, in Gulf of La Spezia she took part, together with "Andrea Doria" and French ships and in a joint exercise which brought together the whole on May 5, 2009.
"Caio Duilio" was, along with the aircraft carrier and the training ship , one of the Navy Units visitable in Civitavecchia harbour on the Day of the Unification of Italy and the Armed Forces on November 4, 2009.
She participated in the naval parades for the celebrations of the Italian Navy Day in Naples on June 10, 2010 and in La Spezia on June 10, 2011, at the presence of President Giorgio Napolitano.
During the development of many complex systems on board, and during the trials that led her many times in the Naval Station of Taranto, she made her debut in the international arena during NATO exercise Proud Manta 2011 from February 4 to February 17, 2011, in the waters of the Ionian Sea, even before the delivery of the Battle Ensign (that took place in Gaeta on September 22, 2011), working together with ships, submarines and aircraft of nine allied nations.
Nowadays "Caio Duilio" is the only destroyer based in La Spezia harbour, reporting to Commander of High Seas Forces (COMFORAL) and under the command of Captain Fabio Agostini.

"Caio Duilio" is a multirole ship, with a bias towards anti-aircraft warfare (the ship is much more capable in this role than the older destroyers) and short and medium-range defence capabilities. She is also highly capable in anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare.
The ship has been designed to take and operate with Rotary wing aircraft (EH-101 and NH-90) of much higher performance and more autonomy than previous generation helicopters. The handling of wheeled helicopters on the flight deck is guaranteed up to sea state 6 by the semi-automatic Canadian system TC-ASIST of Indal Technologies committing to these operations a single operator.
By type of ship and technology aboard "Caio Duilio "is able to cover a broad spectrum of maritime activities, ranging from high-intensity military operations to Maritime Security operations. The missions that the unit can perform are: 
The ship was designed to be as little detectable by radar as possible, by using stealth technology for the hull and superstructure. Sea-keeping in unfavorable weather conditions is granted by two pairs of stabilizers.
The acoustic signature was also reduced with an appropriate choice of machinery and engineering solutions and verifying the intensity of the radiated noise, since the design phase. Equal attention has been directed in the infrared (IR) signature branch, by lowering the temperature of engine gases through coaxial exhausts.
Combat system.
After the abandonment of the old system of command and control SADOC, which is used in the latest modernized version in the and es, an integrated type CMS (Command Management System) based on Linux OS was installed by EuroSysNav. This is provided with 10 redundant servers and 24 consoles named MFC (Multi Function Console), of which 19 are located in the Primary CIC (Combat Information Centre), 3 in the secondary CIC in a remote area from the primary CIC, 1 in the Admiral CIC (for staff at the level of CTF/CTG, equipped with special command support systems) and 1 in the bridge for the officer of the watch.
With a MFC each operator, once logged in with own user name and password, can access to all relevant tactical data to his role and has also the possibility to use some common features such as watching the video of cameras or of the IR system, the weapons engagement plan, the situation of the hardware and software subsystems, the flight orders or the weather situation. Web-browsing allows a range of information going from messaging, data exchange with the Command Support System, the weather state and information pages of various kinds.
Once put the ships to escort and the relative priority in the CMS, the system automatically performs the control and the evaluation of dangerous of each air target, and suggests the possible engagement with missiles, artillery or jammers. The system can control up to 24 Aster missiles simultaneously in flight, providing to operators the kill assessment.
There is also a training module that, under the supervision of a "Exercise Director", allows to simulate complex tactical situations faithfully reproducing the capabilities of weapons and sensors on board and allowing you to place exercises were previously possible only with the ship actually at sea.
For the first time in the history of the Italian Navy a ship is provided with an autonomous meteorological and oceanographic system (Metoc), capable of launching atmospheric balloons to make sonar, optical sensors and radar range prediction.
All subsystems, in integrated mode, operate directly managed by the CMS, but in case of battle damage can be managed locally, thus providing a combat Unity survival.
The DCNS Multi-link system, to be replaced in next future with Elsag Datamat M-DLP (Multi Data Link Processor), allows the simultaneous handling of multiple network links (with gateway and forwarding functions) of Link 11, Link 16 type, on radio or on satellite vector. These vectors, also for the voice comms, are fully integrated and managed by the CMS through the subsystem FICS (Fully Integrated Communications System) by Thales Communications.
Platform.
The Platform Management System (PMS), designed by DCNS, allows to command and monitor machinery, electrical equipment, auxiliary services and security services. The entire system can be managed by a simple laptop but it has its own dedicated consoles in the Operative Platform Office, in the two Security Control Posts (fore and aft), on the bridge and in every technical areas.
The unit's hull is divided into two vulnerability areas by a double bulkhead and a cofferdam to improve anti-fire and anti-flooding characteristics. 
Each vulnerability area is in turn formed by two security zones divided into watertight compartments that provide buoyancy with three adjacent compartments flooded. Many systems, both of the platform than of the combat system, are duplicated so that each vulnerability area is independent by the other.
Most of the rooms are equipped with automatic fire and smoke detection systems. Moreover every room is equipped with sprinklers for water, for the additive F-500 (higher performance compared to the foam) or CO2 extinguisher systems. These, unlike the previous generation units, are activated remotely from Security Post by the PMS.
For what concerns CBRN (Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) warfare, there are a specially dedicated decontamination station, a series of new generation sensors for such hazards detection disseminated throughout the ship and an external prewashing facility.
The propulsion system consists of two controllable pitch propellers, which can be coupled independently of each other, via gear couplings, with a diesel engine or a gas turbine in a typical CODOG configuration. The manoeuvrability is provided by a pair of rudders and an electric powered bow thruster.
The daily production of drinking water is 50 m³ thanks to 2 reverse osmosis desalinators.

Queen of the Lakes

Queen of the Lakes is the unofficial but widely recognized title given to the longest vessel active on the Great Lakes of the United States and Canada. It is also the name of an annual festival in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, Ireland, and the winner of a scholarship competition held in connection with the Minneapolis Aquatennial, of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Lake George in New York is called by some "The Queen of the Lakes". The Brazilian city Capitólio has also been given this title. This article features the use of the title on the Great Lakes, usually for lake freighters.
"Queen of the Lakes" has been used as the name of three vessels that sailed on the Great Lakes, but none was the longest on the lakes at the time. The first was a three-masted Canadian schooner built in 1853 as the "Robert Taylor", measuring 133 feet. It was renamed "Queen of the Lakes" sometime before 1864. She sank nine miles off Sodus Point, New York on November 28, 1906. The second was a propeller driven vessel launched in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1853, measuring 196 feet. She was lost to fire in port on June 17, 1869. The third was a small side-wheel steamer built in Wyandotte, Michigan in 1872, measuring 108 feet. While anchored near South Manitou Island she caught fire and burned in 1898. The iron hull was later scrapped.
The title has been bestowed upon vessels that were especially liked or those considered to be especially beautiful or richly appointed. Such was the case as late as 1949, at which time the "Noronic" was so honored. It has been applied to the United States Coast Guard Cutter "Mackinaw" for its long and significant role in facilitating Great Lakes shipping and safety. The most common use of the title, however, at least since the early 1940s, is to honor the largest vessel on the lakes. On April 20, 1841, the "Detroit Free Press" referred to the steamer "Illinois" as "Queen of the Waters", but given that three vessels in that century were named "Queen of the Lakes", its use as a title for the longest ship was not then common. The title is applied retroactively to vessels launched before this use of the title became popular. While some use gross tonnage, capacity, or length between perpendiculars as the criterion, the most commonly accepted standard is length overall (LOA). This article uses LOA as the standard.
Early Queens.
The earliest vessels on the Great Lakes were human powered canoes and bateaux. Sources differ as to what vessel qualifies as the first real "ship" on the lakes. Many say it was "Le Griffon", built by LaSalle through the winter and spring of 1678 and 1679, and launched in May of that year to sail the upper lakes (above Niagara). Reports of its size vary from 40 to 70 feet long. Contemporary chroniclers called it both a bark and a brigantine. The "Griffon" was soon lost. It was last seen on September 18, 1679 and was lost with all hands. Her final location is unknown. Those who consider the "Griffon" to have been the first ship on the lakes—and hence, the first Queen—also consider her to have been the first lost.
Other sources say the first ship was a smaller vessel built by LaSalle at Fort Frontenac beginning in September, 1678, for the purpose of conveying supplies and material to Niagara. This vessel, which is called the "Frontenac" in some reports, is said to have been about 10 tons burden, measuring from 35 to 45 feet long. Expedition journalists called it a brigantine. It departed Fort Frontenac under La Motte's and Louis Hennepin's leadership on November 18, 1678, and arrived at the east bank of the Niagara River on December 6, 1679. Shortly thereafter, LaSalle and Tonty came with more supplies, and the their vessel (carrying the anchor, rigging, and guns for the "Griffon") foundered in the surf less than thirty miles from Niagara. Hennepin called this vessel a "great bark." One source says the loss occurred on January 8, 1679. Supplies and extra clothing were lost, but LaSalle and his men rescued material for the ship, dragged them to the mouth of the Niagara, rested a few days in an Indian village, and arrived at the settlement above the falls on January 20. Some say the lost vessel was the "Frontenac". Historian Francis Parkman says that by 1677, there were already four vessels on Lake Ontario between 25 and 40 tons burden. He does not say if any of them were named. Tonty's journal indicates that the vessel he and LaSalle used was a 40 ton vessel, but he does not associate a name with it.
Records of ship sizes on the lakes between 1678 and 1816 are rare. According to the "Detroit Tribune", the vessels "Gladwin", "Lady Charlotte", "Victory", and "Boston" were on the lakes in 1766 and the "Brunswick", "Enterprise", and "Charity" were launched in 1767, 1769, and 1770, respectively, but no dimensions are given. The HMS "Ontario", at 80 feet, was launched on Lake Ontario on May 10, 1780, and sank in a storm on October 31, that same year. A history of Washington Island in Door County, Wisconsin notes that the schooner "Washington", used to supply the fitting out of Fort Howard at the head of Green Bay in 1816, was the longest ship on the lakes at the time, but no details are given.
A Succession of Queens.
On September 7, 1816, the steamer "Frontenac" was launched. She was fitted out as both a schooner and a side-wheel steamer and designed for both passenger and freight transport. At 170 feet she laid claim to the honor of longest active vessel on the lakes, though she saw service only on Lake Ontario. She was scrapped at Niagara in 1827, and the next verifiable Queen was not launched until 1830.
The chart below identifies the succession of vessels known to qualify as "Queen of the Lakes" from 1813 to the present. The succession of queens is not known to be continuous before the "David Dows". Those from the "Frontenac" through the "City of Buffalo" were side-wheel steamships, though the "Michigan", like the "Frontenac" was dual fitted as an operational schooner. The heyday of the luxurious passenger steamers was waning even as some of them were launched. The "Mississippi", "Plymouth Rock", and "Western World" were all out of service by 1859, and the Queens that had not already been lost by 1862 were rebuilt as barges or schooners or dismantled within a year. The "Nebraska" was a propeller driven steamer for freight and passenger use, but given what had happened to her predecessors, she was likely not so richly appointed. In 1904, the "Nebraska" was refitted as a lumber carrier, after which time she resembled a classic bulk carrier. The "David Dows" was a 5-masted schooner used primarily for transporting wheat. The "Susquehanna", "Owego", and "Chemung" were propeller driven package freighters. The whaleback "Christopher Columbus" was a celebrated passenger vessel. The "Onoko" and all other vessels from the "Curry" on were or are propeller driven bulk carriers.
The steamship "Quebec", launched in 1865, appears in lists of Great Lakes vessels. At 283 feet, she was longer than both the "Nebraska" and the "David Dows", but her service was on the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec, not on the Great Lakes proper. She continued in service for many years and was dismantled in 1938.

Red tree sponge

The red tree sponge, red tubular sponge, or red sponge ("Amphimedon compressa") is a demosponge found in southern Florida, the Caribbean Sea, and the Bahamas. It can be deep red, orange, brown, or black. 
Taxonomy.
The red tree sponge used to be classified as "Haliclona rubens", but this was determined to be a synonym of "Haliclona compressa". This name, however, is no longer accepted, and the World Porifera Database lists this species as "Amphimedon compressa" – Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1864.
Description.
The red tree sponge can grow to a length of and a diameter of , but it is usually smaller in shallow water. The tree-like curved branches grow from a basal encrusting mass, but very occasionally this sponge grows as a small, unbranched, flattened hemisphere. Many small osculi are found on the branches. It is usually a dull dark red, but the colour varies and it is sometimes black, dark brown, greyish-brown, bright red, or orange. In dark positions under overhangs, it grows in mats and its colour is weak.
Distribution.
The red tree sponge grows as part of the coral reef community. It occurs in Florida, the Caribbean Sea, and the Bahamas at depths to about . It occurs on the crests and sides of the reef growing on rock, and on vertical surfaces, it protrudes sideways.
Biology.
The red tree sponge feeds on plankton and tiny organic particles suspended in the water. To do this, the sponge draws in water through small pores called ostia, filters out particles in the choanocyte tissue, then moves the water through the spongocoel or central cavity before pumping the water out through the osculi.
Ecology.
The red tree sponge is part of a sponge community in a belt at depths between off the Cayman Islands, and often grows out horizontally from rock faces. It often has the sponge brittle star ("Ophiothrix suensoni") living on its surface. Sponges are often eaten by sea stars, but the red tree sponge contains certain secondary metabolites which deter feeding by the common Caribbean starfish "Echinaster echinophorus".

African Exploration Mining and Finance Corporation

The African Exploration Mining and Finance Corporation (AEMFC) is a state-controlled mining business in South Africa.
The AEMFC was launched by Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa, prompting concerns that the state might attempt to nationalise parts of the mining industry.
First established in 1944, it lay dormant for years, before beginning activities in 2007. It has been granted mining and prospecting rights, in competition with other mining companies. AEMFC is, officially, subsidiary to the Central Energy Fund.
In February 2011, the AEMFC launched a coal mining project in Mpumalanga, which is expected to produce 1.68 million tons of coal per year.
, AEMFC was still loss-making, but gets interest-free loans from the Central Energy Fund. Performance of its coal, limestone, and uranium mines has been disappointing.

Asim Mukhopadhyay

Asim Mukhopadhyay (, also known as Asim Mukherjee ) is a famous figure in the history of mountaineering in West Bengal, India. He is the pioneer in India for organising high altitude scientific expeditions in Himalayan region. He took part in many such expeditions as a climber between 1959 and 1974 and organised a few more in that period and later as an administrator. He was one of the main organisers of first successful climbing on Nanda Ghunti and Tirsuli peaks by any non government Indian organisation. Mukhopadhyay is also known for his vast knowledge on Pali, Buddhist literature and culture.
Early life, education, and teaching career.
Mukhopadhyay was born in Kolkata, India, the second son of Malin Kumar Mukhopadhyay, a famous advocate who appeared for Kazi Nazrul Islam in Banksal Court, Kolkata. He is the third of a family of four sisters and six brothers. 
He passed Matriculation in 1946 from Collins Institute, Lenin Sarani, Kolkata. He completed his Intermediate in 1948 and Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Pali from Vidyasagar College, Kolkata. He passed Master of Arts in Pali from University of Calcutta in 1952. He got great scholars like Suniti Kumar Chatterji, Nalinaksha Dutta, Sukumar Sen and Sukumar Sengupta as teachers during the same period. Sukumar Sengupta was Head of the Department of Pali department of the University of Calcutta and research guide in the Asiatic Society.
Mukhopadhyay was a teacher during 1953–1962 in Calcutta Corporation Primary School. He joined as a teacher of Pali in Ultadanga United High School in January 1963. He continued in the same school up to his retirement in 1992.
He was President of Calcutta Corporation Teachers' Union for four years. He was also member of Board of Studies, West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education during 1973–1977 as a representative of Pali.
Interest in Himalaya.
Mukhopadhyay started feeling of exploring challenges in life after completing his M.A. in 1952. He and his friend Gouranga Banerjee, working as in charge of reading section in Anandabazar Patrika started from Kolkata in October of the same year. They reached to Uttarkashi via Haridwar, Devprayag, Rudraprayag by bus and walked to Badrinath via Joshimath. After trekking of about 11 miles to Vasudhara falls on Alakananda, they returned to Kolkata. Mukhopadhyay organised a few expeditions to Himalaya before he completed his mountaineering training in 1962 in spite of being a little heavy and aged for the training at that time. He had to make himself physically fit by losing weight and leaving smoking forever. Famous Tibetan mountaineer Nawang Gombu was the main coach and trainer.
Kalindi Pass Expedition, 1959.
Mukhopadhyay took part in the expedition, the first by a non government group in India, along with Sailesh Chakrabarty and Sukumar Ray. However it was not recognized as "Expedition" by Indian Mountaineering Foundation.
Nanda Ghunti Expedition, 1960.
Mukhopadhyay was one of the main organisers of the famous Nanda Ghunti Expedition, the first successful climb to the pick ever. The budget of the expedition was about INR 45000. They approached many industrialists including Krishna Kumar Birla, Alamohan Das for monetary help. Finally Ashok Sarkar, editor of the Anandabazar Patrika agreed to sponsor the expedition. A reporter Gour Kishore Ghosh and a photographer accompanied the climbers for regular reporting to Anandabazar. The expedition was carried out under leadership of Sukumar Ray, an employee of Calcutta Corporation. Other team memberes were Dilip Banerjee, Nemai Bose, Dhruba Majumder, Bishwadeb, Pemba Norbu, Nima Tashi and others. Sukumar Ray and Nima Tashi climbed Nandaghunti on October 22, 1960.
Roopkund Expedition, 1963.
Swami Pranavanand wrote an article named "Mysterious lake of Roopkund" on The Illustrated Weekly of India in 1962. Swami mentioned his finding of more than five hundred dead bodies at north western side of Roopkund lake. He also mentioned about local legend of king Jasdhawal and queen Ballabha sung by villagers of Wan village. The legend says that the bodies are of companions of the king. Queen gave birth of a child in the place and the whole group died due to earthquake and a snow strom created by goddess Nandadevi because of not maintaining the sanctity of the holy place.
Sukumar Ray formed a new organisation named "Hikers Club Bengal" with Anima Banerjee as president. Mukhopadhyay and the other members of the club were inspired by the article and wrote a letter to Swami mentioning their planned expedition. Pranavanand initially discouraged them as the area is really dangerous for an expedition. Yet the group planned for an expedition in order to resolve the mystery of the dead bodies. A team of eight led by Sukumar Ray reached the ashram of Swami at Garur belongs to present Uttarakhand. Mukhopadhyay joined the team as an archeologist. Other members of the team were Charu Das, Kalidas Banerjee, Sushanta De Sarkar, Sushanta Gupta (photographer)and a few more. Raichand Sing was taken as guide as he accompanied Swami Pranavanand too. The final destination by bus was Gwaldam. The team started trekking from there. They faced a problem related to remuneration of the high altitude porters in a village called Pathar Nachuni on the way. The people of Wan village could not sung the legendary story of king Jasdhawl. Mukhopadhyay concluded that the legend was not true as was described by Raichand Singh, who is from the same village, to Swami. They reached to Roopkund on 2 October. However the area was covered with almost 20 feet of snow because of heavy snow fall. So the bodies could not be seen. The team took a different route to reach Gwaldam, the end point of expedition. Sushanta Gupta created a one hour documentary film on the expedition.
A parallel expedition to the same place and at the same time was organised by Himalayan Association too.
Tirsuli Expedition, 1966.
Secretary of Himalayan Association Chanchal Kumar Mitra requested Mukhopadhyay to join the team as chief patron and advisor. Mukhopadhyay did not join the expediation in order to organise the activities from Kolkata. He was the main interface to the printing media, mainly UNI and PTI who were publishing the reports during and after the expedition. This was the first successful summit to the peak after six failed attempts earlier. Nirapada Mullik and Shyamal Chakravarty were the summitters. Other notable members were Manik Banerjee, Marcopolo Srimal, Dr. Amitabha Sen (medical officer). The team was congratulated by many mountaineering organizations around the world after the success.
Council of Himalayan Exploration and Research.
During his exploration of Himalaya Mukhopadhyay felt the necessity of organising scientific expeditions with scholars from different academic fields to conduct studies on mostly unexplored high altitude Himalayan region. He called for a convention with scholars of Botany, Zoology, Anthropology, Geology, Biochemistry etc. from different colleges and universities and a few experienced mountaineers in the month of January, 1968. It was decided to form an organisation to conduct such scientific explorations. Thus the council, brain child of Mukhopadhyay was formed in 1968 with himself as the first chairman and Kalidas Banerjee as vice chairman. Other notable members were Netai Roy (secretary), Pradip Dasgupta (secretary), Arun Mukherjee (secretary), Sailesh Chakravorty (accountant/treasurer). The registered office of the council was in 24 Creek Row, Kolkata. 
Being first of its kind in India, the organisation was established to promote mountaineering based scientific explorations, publication of research papers etc. Research scholars associated with the organisation were Pradip Dasgupta (Lecturer, Department of Geology, Presidency College, Kolkata), Himanshu Banerjee (Lecturer, Department of Zoology, Presidency College, Kolkata), Bishwanath Banerjee (Professor of Anthropology, Science College, Kolkata), Rasomoy Dutta (Botanical Survey of India), Narendra Mohon Dutta (Lecturer, Department of Botany, City College, Kolkata). Later joined Tridib Bose (Geography, National Atlas Organisation), Kamal Banerjee (Lecturer, Department of Zoology, Presidency College, Kolkata), Prabal Dey (Zoological Survey of India), Dr. Gour Gopal Maiti (Lecturer, Department of Botany, Kalyani University), Mukul Hajra (Anthropological Survey of India). Many samples were collected and research papers were published from the expeditions conducted by the council.
Kuti Valley Expedition, 1968.
This was the first expedition conducted by the council. Mukhopadhyay along with Prof. Pradeep Dasgupta was the main organiser of the expedition. The initial scheme was rejected by Indian Mountaineering Foundation mentioning that it was out of their scope to grant money for such a scientific exploration. IMA suggested seeking support from University Grant Commission, who also refused to provide the support. The scheme was re-planned to divide into two parts in order get financial support within the rules and regulations of IMA. Education department of West Bengal Government, Amrita Bazar Patrika and Jugantar Patrika were also co sponsors. Under the leadership of Pradip Dasgupta two peaks beside Nama Pass were under plan for climbing, although could not be climbed due to heavy snow fall in the region. A new virgin peak, unnamed on map but locally called Sangtang (6630 m), was targeted for climbing. It is the highest peak in Zanskar range. There was an unsuccessful attempt to climb Sangtang by two Swiss geologists Dr. Heim and Dr. Gansaar in 1936. Special permission was taken from the Indian military base located there as the peak was very close to the India-Tibet border. Kalidas Banerjee, Shanti Chatterjee, Charuchandra Das, Sushanta Gupta(photographer), Anil Kumar Dutta and Sushanta Kumar De Sarkar were notable among the team members. The summit party, led by Dilip Bhattacharya, sherpa Pemba Tharkay and sherpa Wanchoo conquered the peak at 2.55 PM on 25 September. The peak was named Ramkrishna Parbat by the team after the famous Indian mystic Ramakrishna Paramhansa.
The research papers published out of this expedition were:
Upper Spiti Exploration, 1970.
The pre monsoon expedition was carried out under leadership of Prof. Pradip Dasgupta. Other members were Kalidas Banerjee and Dr. Chatterjee (Anthropological Survey of India). This was the second expedition organised by the council.
Manirang Expedition, 1974.
Manirang is one of the highest peaks in Himachal Pradesh. A six week long expedition for climbing the peak was organised by Council of Himalayan Exploration and Research under the leadership of Pradip Dasgupta. Apart from Mukhopadhyay the other members were Sailesh Chakravorty, Dilip Dutta and Prashanta Roy. The purpose of the expedition was to conduct a survey on socio religious life of the indigenous people with special reference to Buddhist culture. Different phases of the evolution of Buddhism, Buddhist art and architecture were studied. The team started from Kolkata on 2 June 1974. The team had a meeting with Dr. Y.S. Parmar, chief minister of Himachal Pradesh and got Raptan Chhering Budh, a local interpreter through him. The journey started from Tabo and continued through Poh and Dankhar. Monasteries including Tabo, Kee and Dankhar were visited and the culture and lifestyle of Buddhist were studied in detail. In Dankhar monastery they found young monks painting about Buddhist mythology on the inner walls of caves. Pradip Dasgupta met with an accident and his thigh got severely injured during the journey to the Babeh pass. After preliminary first aid, he was carried by sherpas as the journey continued. On 2 July Mukhopadhyay fell down from a height of about 200 ft and managed to escape from a sure death by falling into Spiti river as he somehow managed to hang on to a rock at the last moment. However his knee got fractured due to the impact with the stone. This was his last expedition as a climber.
Kuti Valley Project (2nd Phase) 1976.
The potential of Kuti valley in terms of research work on various branches of science inspired the council to conduct the second scientific expedition in the region. The team led by Dilip Kumar Dutta started from Kolkata on 3 October and reached Tawaghat in Pithoragarh district, the final point by bus, on 10th. They reached in Kuti village on 22nd. Zoological collections were not up to the mark as anticipated earlier. Zoologists Probal Dey and Kamal Banerjee collected some reptiles including a poisonous snake, butterflies, parasites etc. Botanist Dr. Gour Maiti collected about two hundred plat species. Anthropology data were collected emphasising on marriage system, Philology and physical studies. Anthropologist Mukul Hazra found that consanguineous marriage was common in this region earlier. Dr. Tridib Kumar Bose, a geographer, recorded complete weather chart from Pithoragarh to Kuti. Some plants used by local people for medicinal purpose were collected too. Mukhopadhyay organised the expedition and handled the administrative side of it.
Exploration SPINGPA Valleys 1978.
SPINGPA stands for Spiti Valley, Pin, Yang valleys of Spiti district, Ropa, Baspa valleys of Kinnaur district, Manirang pass and Manirang peak (6593 m). The budget for the expedition was about INR 25000. The twelve member team consisted of research scholars from different fields of science and a few mountaineers. The team, led by Dr. Pulak Lahiri started on 21 May from Kolkata. A few of the targeted research areas are mentioned below.
Rock Climbing course in Susunia Hill, Bankura.
Mukhopadhyay and Sukumar Ray surveyed Ajodhya Hills, Purulia to find out possibilities of rock climbing course in 1961. It was found unsuitable for the same. They also surveyed Jaichandi Hills, Adra, Purulia and found it dangerous for such a course. Finally Susunia hills in Bankura was surveyed in 1962 and found suitable for the course. The course was formally started in 1963 on a regular basis under the banner of Himalayan Association. Later other mountaineering clubs also included such courses to Susunia and other places. Council of Himalayan Exploration and Research later organised rock climbing courses in their training programs for new aspiring mountaineers.

Ponikve, Dobrepolje

Ponikve (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Dobrepolje in Slovenia. The area is part of the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.

Samuel Browne (divine)

Samuel Browne (1575?–1632) was a British divine.
Life.
He was a clerk of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1594, at the age of nineteen, graduated B.A. on 3 November 1601, and M.A. on 3 July 1605, and took orders.
In 1618, he was appointed minister of St. Mary's Church, Shrewsbury, "where he was much resorted to by precise people for his edifying and frequent preaching" (Wood). 
In spite, however, of this notice of his ministry in the 'Athenae Oxon.,' Browne can scarcely have been a puritan, for in the curious little book entitled 'The Looking-glasse of Schisme, wherein by a briefe and true Narration of the execrable Murders done by Enoch ap Evan, a downe-right Nonconformist . . . the Disobedience of that Sect . . . is plainly set forth' (1635), the author, Peter Studley, minister of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury speaks of him with great respect, and says that during the thirteen years of his ministry he was 'rudely and unchristianly handled' by the disloyal and schismatical party in the town, and that finally, 'by an invective and bitter Libel, consisting of fourteene leaves in quarto cast into his garden, they disquieted nis painefull and peaceable soule, and shortened the date of his troublesome pilgrimage.'
Browne died in 1632, and was buried at St. Mary's on 6 May.

Platycerus caraboides

Platycerus caraboides is a species of stag beetle belonging to the family Lucanidae, subfamily Lucaninae. 
These beetles are present in most of Europe, in the Near East and in North Africa.
"Platycerus caraboides" has a flat body, green or iridescent blue. It can be easily distinguished as a stag beetle by its elbowed antennae.
The adults grow up to long and can mostly be encountered from May through July, flying around during the day in deciduous forests or staying on the ground on rotten branches. The predominantly host-plants are broadleaf plants, but also conifers (mainly "Pinus" species). The larvae usually live on decayed wood of oak and beech.

Barbapedana

Barbapedana (Milanese: Barbapedanna) is a word of uncertain origin that refers to a Milanese minstrel and cantastorie ("story singer") that sang in such places as "trani" (the Milanese traditional "osterie", i.e., pubs). While the word "barbapedana" dates back at least to the 17th century, "the Barbapedana" per antonomasia was Enrico Molaschi, active in the late 19th century. Many rhymes from his repertoire have remained in the popular culture of Milan; for example, this is the case for the lines that Barbapedana sang to describe himself (such as "Barbapedanna el gh'aveva on gilé / Rott per denanz e strasciaa per dedree"; that is, "Barbapedana wore a gilet, broken in front and ripped off in the back") and for the nursery rhyme "De piscinin che l'era" ("So small he was"), about a man who was so small that he could do such things as "dance on top of a coin" or "make 200 shirts out of a piece of fabric".
History of the Barbapedana.
The origin and meaning of the word "barbapedana" are uncertain. Poetry by some "Barba Pedana" from Veneto, dating back to the 17th century, is reportedly preserved in the Biblioteca di San Marco in Venice. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his "Confessions", mentions a cousin nicknamed "Barna Bredanna". While it is unclear whether there is any relation between these and Barbapedana, it is reasonable to believe that the Milanese minstrels of the 17th century were representatives of an older tradition that possibly extended across northern Italy and other areas of southern Europe.
The oldest known reference to the word "barbapedana" is possibly found in Carlo Maria Maggi's dialectal play "Il Barone di Birbanza" (1696; lines 324-325): "L'ho dij par quij che porten la capascia / fin de Barbapedanna / che fa bandera su la durlindanna", where Barbapedanna is described as someone who puts his cloak on top of his sword's grip, like a flag; this is supposedly a reference to the habits of the dandy, playful Milanese youth of the time. Poet Gaetano Crespi reports an anonymous poem, also of the 17th century, which has this reference to the "cloak appended to the sword" (possibly an influence of Maggi's works), but otherwise describes the Barbapedana as a funny minstrel, and states that the cloak's lining was ripped off, that the man was "a man of Carnival" ("homm de carnevaee") and that he was "one span tall" ("volt una spanna"), all of which are direct references to Barbapedana's most popular tunes:
As this description includes the main traits of the Barbapedana as it is remembered today, and even obvious references to his most popular songs, it can easily be argued that an essentially immutated Barbapedana "heritage" was passed over from one generation to the next, at least since the 17th century and possibly earlier, down to the last representatives of the genre, who were active in the early 20th century.
Enrico Molaschi.
The best known interpreter of the "barbapedana" was Enrico Molaschi (1823–1911). A description of his figure and style is found in several sources of the time, including Arrigo Boito's essay on traditional street music, an essay on Milanese traditions by Severino Pagani, and a book of Milanese poet and scholar Luigi Medici. According to these sources, Molaschi had met a former "Barbapedana" in the outskirts of Milan, in the area of Paullo, and later took on his heritage. After becoming a popular minstrel himself, in 1862, Molaschi relocated with his family to Milan, namely to a house in the district of Porta Tosa. Besides playing in the osterie, he was invited at celebrations, and in summer he was a regular of the garden parties in the luxury villas in Brianza. He was so popular that Queen Margherita of Savoy invited him to play for her in the Royal Villa of Monza; also, one year he was honoured with the role of "king of the Carnevale Ambrosiano" (Milan's carnival). In any case, especially in the last part of his life, Molaschi usually played in the area of what are now Piazzale Loreto and Corso Buenos Aires.
Boito, who could actually see Barbapedana Molaschi play when Molaschi was in his forties, describes him as surprising musician and a guitar virtuoso, and as a muscolar and energetic man. Pagani and Medici, on the other hand, describe Molaschi as an old man (in the early 20th century), depicting him as short and rather fat, wearing an old dark coat and a top hat adorned with a squirrel's tail.
Barbapedana's most popular songs were the forementioned "De piscinin che l'era" and "Barbapedanna el gh'avea on gilé", and "La tegnoeura" ("the bat"), with lyrics by Milanese poet Averardo Buschi. Anyway, he usually adapted these songs to the audience he played for, so that his exhibitions were always partially based on improvisation; for this reason, he is also remembered as an interpreter of the "bosinada", a Milanese literary genre that is based on dialectal improvisation in verses.
Molaschi performed until the early 20th century; by then, he had lost his teeth; as he could hardly sing, he mostly whistled his tunes. He was eventually admitted to the "Baggina" retirement home, where he died on 26 October 1911. His guitar (created in 1823 by renowned Milanese luthier Antonio Rovetta) is now exposed at the Museum of Musical Instruments of Milan.
Molaschi's heritage greatly contributed to the Barbapedana tradition and to the Milanese folklore in general. For example, it is a consequence of Molaschi's great popularity if the song "De piscinin che l'era", that actually predates the 19th century and is traditional of most of northern Italy, is usually referred to as a "typical milanese song".
After Enrico Molaschi.
Molaschi was not the last Barbapedana, although the tradition began to fade after his death. Ethnomusicologist Roberto Leydi accounts for at least another Barbapedana claiming to be Molaschi's direct heir, active in the first half of the 20th century; and Luigi Veronelli mentions a "Barbapedana" Sandro Zonca who was a regular guest at the "Bocciofila Martesana" (a bocce club on the Navigli), who was "poblematic" and "indulged in profanity", a fact that Veronelli ascribes to Zonca's awareness of the fact that he was "one of the last".
References in popular culture.
The traditional songs by Barbapedana have been recorded by several authors; a notable example is Nanni Svampa's recording of "È tornato Barbapedana" ("Barbapedana is back"). Barbapedana is also the name of an Italian kletzmer band.

Samuel Browne (judge)

Samuel Browne (c. 1598–1668), of Arlesey, Bedfordshire, was Member of Parliament during the English Civil War and the First Commonwealth who supported the Parliamentary cause. However he refused to support the trial and execution of Charles I and, along with five of his colleagues, resigned his seat on the bench. At the Restoration of 1660 this was noted and he was made a judge of the Common Pleas.
He was called to bar at Lincoln's Inn, 1623; M.P. for Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness, 1640; an active member of the Commons committee for the impeachment of Archbishop Laud, 1644; one of the commissioners to treat with Charles I in the Isle of Wight, 1648; serjeant-at-law, 1648. M.P. for Bedford in 1659 and in 1660 M.P. for Bedfordshire. He was justice of the common pleas and knighted, 1660.
Biography.
Early life.
Samuel Browne, was born about the year 1598 and was the eldest son of a vicar, Nicholas Browne of Polebrook in Northamptonshire, and Frances, daughter of Thomas St. John, of Cayshoe, Bedfordshire (who was the grandfather of Oliver St John, the chief justice of the Common Pleas during the Protectorate).
Browne was admitted pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge on 24 February 1614, and was entered at Lincoln's Inn on 28 October 1616, where he was called to the Bar in October 1623, and elected reader in Autumn 1642.
Browne, along with a number of other men who would support Parliamentary cause in the Civil War, had connections to the Feoffees for Impropriations, a body set up in 1625 to purchase livings for Puritan preachers, or the Massachusetts Bay Company. Brown was both a feoffee and a lawyer for the Company. Browne along with John Browne, member for Dorset, and Richard Browne member for New Romney, were all zealous about matters of religion in the Long Parliament, and it is not all ways possible to identify which of the Brownes made a statement on the subject. Although he is often associated with parliamentary radicals, his position like other "Royal Independents" was that they wanted more tolerance of other Protestant creeds than King Charles was willing to allow, and so Browne took up arms to force the King into toleration (see also Cromwellian State Church, 1654–1660).
Property.
Browne inherited from his father various small properties lying in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and London. He also purchased the manor of Arlesey in Bedfordshire from Florence, daughter of Thomas Emery of Arlesey (died 1636), widow of Henry Goodwin in 1646 or 1649, but he must have been living in it before that date as in 1644 complained that Arlesley was used for quartering troops, and he procured an order for their removal.
Public office.
Browne probably served as a Justice of the Peace in Essex, his wife's county, however, and had been named in 1630 for the sewers commission in Bedfordshire.
He was returned as a member for the boroughs of Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness, in the Long Parliament of November 1640. He appears to have had no connection with the constituency before he was elected and he may have gained it through the patronage of his cousin Oliver St John who was MP for Totness and had been in Lincoln's Inn at the same time as Browne.
In February 1643—possibly through the influence of his cousin St. John (who was then solicitor-general)—Browne, Serjeant Richard Creswell and John Puleston, were recommended by the parliament to be Barons of the Exchequers, in the peace proposals laid before the king at Oxford, which came to nothing. Around the same time he joined the newly formed Committee of Both Kingdoms on which he would continue to sit until 1648, and he also the Committee for the preservation of the records. In November of that year Browne and St. John were two of the four members of the House of Commons to whom, with two lords, the new Great Seal was entrusted.
The commoners appointed as commissioner of the Great Seal still continued to perform their other parliamentary functions. Lord Commissioner Browne was most active in the proceedings against Archbishop Laud, summing up the case in the House of Lords and carrying up the ordinance for his attainder passed by the Commons in November 1644. His speech has not been preserved, but from the constant references which Laud makes to it he appears to have put the case against the archbishop in a very effective way.
After the trial was ended (2 January 1645) he was deputed, with Serjeants John Wilde and Robert Nicolas, to lay before the House of Lords the reasons which, in the opinion of the House of Commons, justified an ordinance of attainder against the archbishop. This had already been passed by the commons, and the Lords immediately followed suit.
In July 1645 a paper was introduced to the House of Commons, emanating from Lord Savile, and containing what was in substance an impeachment of Denzil Holles and Bulstrode Whitelocke, of high treason in betraying the trust reposed in them in connection with the recent negotiations at Oxford, of which they had had the conduct. After some discussion the matter was referred to a committee, of which Browne was nominated chairman. The affair is frankly described by Whitelocke as a machination of the independents, designed to discredit the Presbyterian party, of which both Hollis and himself were members; and as he accuses Browne of displaying a strong bias in favour of the impeachment, it may be inferred that at this time he had the reputation of belonging to the advanced faction. The charge was ultimately dismissed.
In 1646 Browne sat on the Committee for exclusion from sacrament and the Committee for the abuse of hereditary, and after remaining a commissioner of the Great Seal for nearly three years, the lords commissioners were removed in October 1646, and the Great Seal transferred to the speakers of the two houses. With his workload in Parliament reduced he resumed his practice at the bar.
In 1648 Browne sat on the Committee for scandalous offences and his time of sitting on the Committee of Both Kingdoms came to an end. He was also sent as one of the commissioners to treat with the king in the Isle of Wight. On the receipt of letters from the commissioners containing the king's ultimatum (the Treaty of Newport), the House of Commons, after voting the king's terms unsatisfactory, resolved "that notice be taken of the extraordinary wise management of this treaty by the commissioners".
The next day, 12 October 1648 day, he was included in the batch of twenty-two who were made Serjeants by the parliament, when both he and his cousin St. John were also elevated to the bench, he as judge of the King's Bench, and St. John as chief justice of the Common Pleas. With the failure of the Newport negotiations (and the reconstitution of the House of Commons by Pride's Purge), the House of Commons resolved to try King Charles for treason, Browne with five of his colleagues, resigned their seats on the bench rather than participate in the Regicide.
Browne took no further part in public life until the last year of the Interregnum. After the fall of the Protectorate Browne was elected to Parliament for the constituency of Bedford in 1659 and to Bedfordshire in the Convention Parliament of 1660.
After the restoration of the monarchy, he was not only immediately reinstated as a serjeant, and within six months was reinstated to a place on the bench, being constituted on November 3, 1600, a judge of the Common Pleas. On 4 December of that year he was knighted. He retained his seat as a judge of the Common Pleas until his death on 11 April 1668. He was buried under a monument still existing in the church of Arlesey in Bedfordshire, where he had a house.
Family.
Browne married Elizabeth, daughter of John Meade, of Nortofts, Finchingfield, Essex.

He helped Town into second place (behind Keighley Cougars, and to the final of the Divisional Premiership competition, when they were narrowly beaten by Featherstone Rovers, from the division above.
In 1993-94, Pickering was the driving force behind Town doing the Division Two and Premiership double as they won the league in emphatic style, and beat London Crusaders at Old Trafford 30-22.
Back in the game's elite, Workington enjoyed an impressive 1994-95 campaign finishing ninth out of 16 and reaching the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup. Once again, Pickering was the side's shining light with even the finest prop forwards in the game struggling to come to terms with the Fijian's swashbuckling stlye of play.

Karabucak Forest is a forest plantation in Turkey
Geography.
The forest is at the south of Tarsus city in Mersin Province. The center of the forest is at about . The distance to Tarsus is and to Mersin is . There are two sections in the forest. In the older section called "Güresin" forest Eucalyptus "(Eucalyptus camaldulensis)" has been planted
History.
During the ancient ages, Tarsus was a Mediterranean Sea port. But because of alluvial deposits from the Berdan River the coastline was continuously moving to south. By the 6th century, the coastline had already been moved away and a small lagoon named "Rhegma" had been formed which obstructed the river flow in the rainy seasons and caused floods. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527-565) had a channel constructed at the east of the city to facilitate easier flow. (present watercourse of the river). After 7th century the lake was partially dried up and turned into marshes. But because of the marshes, the number of malaria cases increased sharply. In 1939, the Turkish government (ministry of forestry) started a project to drain the marshes. Eucalyptus trees were planted on 885 hectare area and the marshes were totally drained.
In 1960s the forest was further enlarged by covering the coastal band. Pine was preferred in the coastal band.
Karabucak today.
The marsh has been drained and the sands movement at the coast has been checked. The forest in addition to being a source of revenue, is now a popular picnic area for Tarsus citizens.

Yerevan Botanical Garden

The Yerevan Botanical Garden of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences is the responsible body for plant collections in Armenia. It is located in the Avan district at the north-eastern part of the capital Yerevan, occupying around 80 hectares of a semi deserted area. The collection includes more than 200 species of endemic, rare and declining plants, and provides a basis for the study of Armenian flora and the ecological interactions of species, in a relatively natural environment.
History.
The Yerevan Botanical Garden was opened in 1935 in the north-eastern part of Yerevan. The Botanical Institute was opened three years later. The collective greenhouse was founded in 1939 occupying 25 square meters. In 1944 a new greenhouse was built, the overall territory of which was 610 square meters. It included the winter garden (106 sq.m.), section of succulent plants, section of subtropical plants (126 sq.m.), section of tropical plants (126 sq.m.) and section for houseplant cultivation.
In 1950, the garden became the largest part of the Botanical Institute. 
In the period between 1954–1970, the Director of the Botanical Institute and the botanists L.B. Makhatadse and A.O. Mkrtchyan put a large collection of Caucasian flora together, so that almost every plant of Armenia was represented the approximately on 16 hectare area.
At the same time, a big rosary and lily garden was created as well. 
In addition, there were more regions represented: the Caucasus, North America, Europe, Siberia and East Asia. 
Much of the collection consists of representatives of the Family Cupressaceae, and Varieties, Pinaceae, Fabaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Oleaceae, Rosaceae, the generator: Juniperus, Quercus, Syringa, Clematis.
In the park, there were typical Caucasus plants like Quercus castaneifolia, Hedera helix, colurna Corylus, Juniperus sabina, Parrotia persica and Populus euphratica. 
As a representative of the North American flora Liriodendron tulipifera, Juglans nigra, Common TrompetenbaumCatalpa bignonioides, Juniperus virginiana, Yucca filamentosa.
From Europe and Siberia, Aesculus hippocastanum, Cercis siliquastrum, Quercus robur, Larix sibirica 
From the East-Asian region Biota orientalis, Sophora japonica, Metasequoia glyptostroboides. 
In 1980s the greenhouse collection encompassed 1240 species and garden sorts that belonged to 348 classes and 92 families. In the winter garden they cultivated Waschingtonia filifera, Cocos romanzowiana, subtropical fruit-bearing plants like Acca selloviana, Eucaliptus, Laurus nobilis. 
The greenhouse was especially rich in collection of succulent plants. 
Among the ferns, there were presented rare and interesting sorts of the class of Platucerium, Asplenium, Adianthum, Pteris.
In the section of tropical plants in a special place they used to cultivate representatives of orchid family which are singled out by a unique structure and scent of the flower. 
In the section of houseplants they used to cultivate various decorative beautiful blossoming and leave decorative plant species, garden sorts belonging to the class of Begonia, Crinium, Clivia, Fuchsia Nerium, Passiflora, Pelargonium.
Close to the greenhouse there was the department of production of tropical and subtropical plants. From here annually over 200 species of plants were used for decorating the interior of schools, factories and other organizations.
Main Task.
The collection and cultivation of endangered plant species is considered as a main task of the garden (there are 400 endangered plant species in Armenia). Of particular interest here are Taxus baccata, Hedera helix, Juniperus sabina, Zelkova carpinifolia, Rhododendron caucasicum. Another goal is the environmental education. Scientists around the botanical garden in the past had always appeared in the media and wrote articles about the problems of environmental protection in Armenia. They also offer advice on educational institutions, industry and private plant seeders. Field trips for school children are carried out constantly, many students in agricultural biology make this their field studies. There have also been previously unexplored irregularities; some bushes and trees grew in certain areas unnaturally fast. A large number of local and introduced plants were tested on their growth conditions and later successfully planted around the Lake Sevan.
Current status.
The Botanical Gardens in Armenia are currently not in a good state. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the financial resources for the parks disappeared. During the great energy crisis in 1988 many trees were cut down for heating, so that the garden was severely damaged again. At present, the specialists of the garden remove the damages and keep on expanding the existing collection.
The energetic crisis caused also a great damage to the collection greenhouse. The collection of tropical and sub-tropical collection was almost totally destroyed, frostbitten, the whole glass surface was completely destroyed, the watering and heating systems were set out of order, the walls and the shelve stands of the greenhouse fell down, the greenhouse completely terminated its functioning. 
During the following years there were new losses due to the constant changes of plants rooms in winters, as a result of which the remaining collection was also considerably reduced.
Today there is a huge necessity of restoring the economy of the greenhouse, for this purpose it is necessary to implement the activities which are presented in the table below. Currently the Botanical garden is not able to function properly which is due to the lack of enough financial support. The garden being a constituent part of the institute of Botany is financed within the very limited base budget of the institute, with which it is absolutely impossible to implement its scientific and productive functions.
Other botanical gardens in Armenia.
Vanadzor Botanical Garden.
The Botanical Garden of Vanadzor is located at the southern end of the town about 1400–1450 m above sea level. Because of its special climate, not only local plants grow there. Most of the plants are representatives of the following families: Pinaceae, Cupressaceae, Rosaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Salicaceae, Oleaceae and Fabaceae. Significantly involved in the creation of the collection were DG and P.D. Yaroshenko, L.B. Makhatadse and A.A. Grigorian.
Sevan Botanical Garden.
The Botanical Garden of Sevan with an area of 5 hectares, is the smallest among the three parks. It is located very close to Lake Sevan, a small cove, well-protected from the wind, at the northern end of the town. There are most of the representative of the families of the Rosaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Fabaceae.

Skeleton Waterholes Creek

Skeleton Waterholes Creek is a waterway in the outer western and outer south-western regions of Melbourne, Victoria. The creek originates near Mount Cottrell, to the south of Rockbank, and passes through rural land until it reaches the suburban areas of Tarneit, Truganina, Hoppers Crossing, Altona Meadows and Point Cook before it flows into Port Phillip Bay after the Cheetham Wetlands. The creek has important local Aboriginal spiritual significance and parts of the creek are popular sites for recreation.
Environmental condition.
It has been classed as being in "moderate condition" by Melbourne Water, but it is becoming increasingly urbanised as new developments extend across the catchment from Hoppers Crossing and surrounding areas. This new development poses a major risk to the health of the river as does the poor quality of both the creek's water and streamside vegetation along significant parts of the waterway.
The Cheetham Wetlands, a significant site for migratory birds, is located at the mouth of the creek.

Vestiaritai

The Vestiaritai () were a corps of imperial bodyguards and fiscal officials in the Byzantine Empire, attested from the 11th to the 15th centuries.
History and functions.
The "vestiaritai" appear in the mid-11th century, with the first known "vestiaritēs", John Iberitzes, attested in 1049. As their name indicates, they had a connection to the imperial wardrobe and treasury, the "vestiarion", probably initially raised as a guard detachment for it. From circa 1080 on, they were formally distinguished into two groups: the "inner" or "household" "vestiaritai" ("esō" or "oikeioi vestiaritai"), attached to the emperor's private treasury (the "esō/oikeiakon vestiarion") under a "megas primikērios", and the "outer" ("exō vestiaritai") under a "primikērios", who were probably under the public or state treasury ("basilikon vestiarion"). Gradually, they replaced various other groups of armed guards that the Byzantine emperors had employed inside Constantinople itself, such as the "manglabitai" or the "pantheōtai", and became the exclusive corps of the emperor's confidential agents. As the princess and historian Anna Komnene writes, they were the courtiers "closest" to the emperor. With the military crisis of the 1070s, they were also formed into a regular palace guard regiment, serving alongside the Varangian Guard in the Komnenian-era army.
The "vestiaritai" are attested as late as 1387, and likely continued to exist after. In the 13th and 14th centuries, however, their role was chiefly fiscal: they were responsible for levying soldiers and wagons from the provinces, under the control of the "domestikos" of the themes of the East. The chief of the "vestiaritai" was called prōtovestiaritēs (πρωτοβεστιαρίτης) in the 13th and 14th centuries (not to be confused with the much older and more important office of "prōtovestiarios"). The title is attested as late as 1451, when it was held by the historian George Sphrantzes. In the mid-14th century "Book of Offices" of Pseudo-Kodinos, it ranks nineteenth in the order of precedence, following the "parakoimōmenos" of the bedchamber. According to the same work, its insignia were: a wooden staff ("dikanikion") with gold and red-gold knobs, a "skiadion" hat with embroidery of the "klapotōn" type, another type of hat called "skaranikon" of white and gold silk with gold-wire embroidery and images of the emperor in the front and back, and a silk robe of office or "kabbadion".

Burton Pynsent House

Burton Pynsent House is a historic country-house in Britain, situated in the parish of Curry Rivel, Somerset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.
History.
The house was built in 1765 for William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham after he inherited the estate from Sir William Pynsent. It formed part of a wing of a larger earlier house, that was demolished around 1805.
The grounds were laid out in the mid 18th century by Pitt and Lancelot Brown; and they include early-20th-century formal gardens designed by Harold Peto.
The Chatham Vase, a stone sculpture commissioned as a memorial to William Pitt the Elder by his wife, Hester, Countess of Chatham, was originally erected at their house in Burton Pynsent in 1781; but it was moved to the grounds of Chevening House in 1934, where it currently resides.
The Pynsent Column (also known as the Curry Rivel Column, Burton Pynsent Monument, Pynsent Steeple or Cider Monument) stands on Troy Hill, a spur of high ground about 700 m north-east of the house. It was designed in the 18th century by Capability Brown for William Pitt. It was restored in the 1990s by the John Paul Getty Trust and English Heritage.

Mangalampadu

Mangalam-padu () is a village in Sullurpeta mandal of Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh, India.
Famous playwright and lyrics writer Kidambi Venkata Narasimhacharyulu, better known as Aathreya was born in this village.
Demographics.
According to Indian census, 2001, the demographic details of this village is as follows:
History.
Mangalampadu, with around 500 families, is located at a distance of about 90 km from Chennai on the Kolkatta highway and 70 km from Tirupati, in the border district of Nellore, in Sullurpet Mandal of Andhra Pradesh, is a well known Sri Vaishnava Agraharam with a known history of over four hundred years.
This village was given as an endowment in the year 1602–03 by the Ruler of Chandragiri Venkatapathy Raja I of the Vijayanagar Dynasty to Sriman Kidambi Rangaraja Iyengar, the son of Sriman Kidambi Jagannadhacharya Swamy, for his erudite scholarship.
This village is well known in the surrounding towns and villages for various socio-religious activities taken up by the villagers with the help of their friends and well wishers.
The Temple of Sri Venugopalaswamy, at the heart of the village, is the center of all these activities.
For centuries, this village, along with the neighbouring village of Uchur, enjoyed great reputation as a centre for Vaishnavite Culture and religion. Scholars in ancient Oriental Literature and Vedic lore hailed from this village. Their cultural, religious and social pursuits centered round the age-old temple of Sri Venugopalaswamy varu in the village. 
The Temple of Sri Venugopalaswamy in the village has been a silent witness to the extreme surges in the fortunes of the village for hundreds of years. The idol of Sri Venugopalaswamy varu is believed to have been found while digging a well in the village, which later came to be known as “Gudi Mitta Bavi”. The idol, which is beautifully embellished in black stone, is unique in its style. Lord Venugopala sporting a flute in two hands and holding the holy Disc and Conch in two others is the apple of our eyes. There are separate shrines for Goddess Soundaryavalli, Godadevi, Bhaktanjaneya swamy, Bhagavad Ramanuja and Vedanta Desika -the two Great Srivaishnavite Acharyas. One can see all Alwars and Acharyas doing Mangalasasanams in the temple.
The utsava Moorthy in the temple is that of Varadarajaswamy and is said to have been brought from Kanchipuram a century and half ago. The annual festival in the month of Phalgun is a visual treat for the hundreds of devotees who throng the temple during these days.
The younger generation of the village, who have migrated to various places in search of livelihood, have formed a trust to streamline the activities with vision of “Making Mangalampadu A Model Village – Vision 2015”. The trust, with the support of the Hereditary Trustees of the Temple and the villagers, is organising various religious, social and cultural activities in the village.
The trust organises Sadas, cultural programmes and Goshtis during important festivals in the Temple. It also runs a Gov Shala which, at present, has a strength of 15 cows.
The post-independence political scenario saw a gradual decline in the fortunes of the temple. Sri Vaishnavites had to migrate from the village in search of livelihood. The temple was subject to neglect for want of economic support. When it was slowly decaying, the younger generation of this village rose to the occasion and started renovation in a big way about three decades ago.
In addition to reconstruction of the Mukhamantapams of Srimad Ramanuja and Sri Vedanta Dsika, the Vimana gopurams were renovated some two decades ago.
A high-profile community hall was constructed to address the social needs of the villagers. But the temple, being very old and weather beaten, has developed structural problems in the recent years. Come rains, the ceiling of the temple has become a virtual sieve and the temple gets flooded with rain water.
The Dhwajastambam, which is about seven decades old and has started decaying, has to be replaced with a new one. The Bhaktanjaneya Temple too has to be reconstructed, shifting it slightly to the west to suit the overall requirement of the temple. A Ramakrathu Sthoopam has to be erected in front of it commemorating sixty years of Ramakrathu performed here by the HH The Pedda Sriman Narayana Jeeyar, during his poorvashrama.
A new temple for Sudarsana – Narasimha, an Aina Mahal (Kannadi Mantapam), an Alankaramantapam and a Rajagopuram are in the pipeline.
While the trustees have decided to take up the reconstruction of the main temple with the help of the Department of Endowments, Government of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Rama Kainkaryam Trust has decided to shoulder the responsibility of other activities mentioned above.
Since each of the projects needs heavy financial support, this can be achieved only with the whole hearted co-operation of philanthropists and Asthikas all over.
Economy.
People in Mangalampadu and the villages surrounding it depend on agriculture for their livelihood and rain water and the village tank are the only sources of water for irrigation.
To change this and bring about a green revolution, the Trust has decided to distribute saplings free of cost to the villagers. Till now around 110 Teak and Neem plants have been planted in the village and the Trust wants to make this an annual affair for which an endowment is being planned.
The village has a government-run primary and a high school along with an Anganwadi School. The total strength of all these schools would be about 200 students. The high school has consistent 90% results in 10th class. Some of the students of this school stood 1st in the Sullurpet Mandal. To support the children of the village and bring down the drop-out ratio, the Trust has taken up scholarship programmes for toppers in 10th class apart from distributing books and sports equipment to the school and organising annual Aksharabhyasam for the new joinees. Some well wishers have also come forward to support these activities by establishing an endowment.
To take care of the health of the villagers and to bring in health awareness, the Trust is organising frequent medical camps in the village. With the support of Dr. Jagannath and Dr. Sandhya, ophthalmologists from Tirupati, more than 100 cataract surgeries have been done free of cost for the villagers.
Temples.
Sri Venugopala Swamy temple in the village is very auspicious.

Edelfosine

Edelfosine (ET-18-O-CH3 ; 1-octadecyl-2-"O"-methyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid (ALP). It has antineoplastic (anti-cancer) effects.
Like all ALPs, it incorporates into the cell membrane and does not target the DNA. In many tumor cells, it causes selective apoptosis, sparing healthy cells. Edelfosine can activate the Fas/CD95 cell death receptor, can inhibit the MAPK/ERK mitogenic pathway and the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) survival pathway. Aside from these plasma-level effects, edelfosine also affects gene expression by modulating the expression and activity of transcription factors.
It has immune modulating properties. 
These characteristics cause edelfosine also to affect HIV, parasitic, and autoimmune diseases. 
It can complement classic anti-cancer drugs such as cisplatin.
It can be administered orally, intraperitoneally (IP) and intravenously (IV).
Edelfosine and other ALPs can be used for purging residual leukemic cells from bone marrow transplants.
It is an analog of miltefosine and perifosine.
"In vitro" and "in vivo" results.
Edelfosine apoptosis-inducing abilities were studied with several types of cancer, among them multiple myeloma and non-small and small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. "In vivo" activity against human solid tumors in mice was shown against malignant gynecological tumor cells, like ovarian cancer, and against breast cancer. "In vivo" biodistribution studies demonstrated a “considerably higher” accumulation of Edelfosine in tumor cells than in other analyzed organs. It remained undegraded for a long time.
Clinical trials.
Several clinical trials were conducted. Among them a phase I trials with solid tumors or leukemias and phase II with non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). 
In a Phase II clinical trial for use of Edelfosine in treating leukemia with bone marrow transplants, it was found to be safe and 'possibly effective'.
A phase II trial for the treatment of brain cancers was also reported. It showed encouraging results in stopping the growth of the tumor and a considerable improvement in the “quality of life” of the patients.
A phase II trial on the effect of Edelfosine on advanced non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma had a “remarkable” “high proportion of patients with stationary tumor status” as result, stable disease after initial progression in 50% of the patients. 
Toxicity.
In animal tests the main toxic effect was gastrointestinal irritation. There were no significant negative systemic side effects observed. It showed that edelfosine can be given over a long period safely. Most important, in contrast to many DNA-directed anti-cancer drugs, no bone marrow toxicity was "in vivo" observed. Those findings in animals were confirmed in clinical trials. No mutagenic or cytogenetic effects were observed.
History.
In the 1960s Herbert Fischer and Paul Gerhard in Freiburg, Germany, found that lysolecitin (2-lysophosphhatidylcholine, LPC) increases the phagocytotic activity of macrophages.
Since LPC had a short half-life, synthetic LPC-analogues were tested by Fischer, Otto Westphal, Hans Ulrich Weltzien and Paul Gerhard Munder. Unexpectedly, some of the substances showed strong anti-tumor activity and among them Edelfosine was the most effective. It is therefore considered to be the prototype of synthetic anti-cancer lipids.

The Naked Street

The Naked Street is a 1955 American crime film noir directed by Maxwell Shane. The drama features Farley Granger, Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft.
Plot.
Tough racketeer (Quinn) pulls strings to get his sister's punk boyfriend out of the death house.
Reception.
Critical response.
When the film was released, "The New York Times" film critic, Bosley Crowther, panned the film, writing, "Crime is again demonstrated as an unprofitable form of enterprise — and we might add, an unprofitable form of entertainment — in a little screen-filler called "The Naked Street," produced by Edward Small and delivered yesterday to the Palace, along with eight acts of vaudeville...The whole spectacle is dismal and uninspiring. The only cheerful thing that occurs is that the sister and wife, played by Anne Bancroft, falls in love with and marries a newspaper man."
More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz was also critical of the film, writing, "An unconvincing second-rate film noir directed by the mediocre Maxwell Shane ("Fear in the Night"/"Nightmare"), who mishandles the dismal story line both as director and co-writer. It is based on the story by Leo Katcher. The film's message is that 'crime doesn't pay'...It concludes in an unconvincing way, with the wheels of justice strangely turning as the cops arrive to arrest Phil for obstructing justice. The talented cast was left seemingly on death row by the far-fetched story, the unpleasant characterizations and how flatly it was presently.

Thomas Smythe (died 1625)

Sir Thomas Smythe or Smith (1558?–4 Sep 1625), was an English merchant and politician. He was the first governor of the East India Company.
Early life.
He was born about 1558, the second surviving son of Thomas "Customer" Smythe of Westenhanger Castle in Kent, by his wife Alice, daughter of Sir Andrew Judde. His grandfather, John Smythe of Corsham, Wiltshire, is described as yeoman, haberdasher and clothier, and was High Sheriff of Essex for the year of 1532. His father carried on the business of a haberdasher in the city of London, and was ‘customer’ of the port of London. He purchased Westenhanger from Sir Thomas Sackville, and much other property from Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester and was buried at Sutton, Kent, where there is a beautiful monument to his memory. His elder son, Sir John Smythe or Smith (1556?–1608) of Westenhanger, was High Sheriff of Kent in 1600 and father of Thomas Smythe, 1st Viscount Strangford.
Thomas was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1571) 
Business career.
Thomas, one of thirteen children, was brought up to his father's business. In 1580 he was admitted to the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers and also of the Worshipful Company of Skinners. He rapidly rose to wealth and distinction. He was Auditor for the City of London from 1597 to 1598 and Treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1597 to 1601. In 1597 he was briefly elected to Parliament as the MP for Aylesbury. In 1599 he was elected alderman for Farringdon Without ward and chosen as one of the two sheriffs of the City of London for 1600. When the East India Company was formed in October 1600, he was appointed its first governor by the charter dated 31 December, though at this time he held the office for only four months.
In February 1600/1 Smythe, now serving as sheriff, was suspected of being a supporter of the Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, who on 8 February went to his house in Gracechurch Street. Smythe went out to him, laid his hand on his horse's bridle, and advised him to yield himself to the Lord Mayor of London. As Essex refused to do this and insisted on coming into the house, Smythe made his escape by the back door and went to confer with the Lord Mayor. Afterwards he was accused of complicity with the earl's rebellion, was examined before the privy council, discharged from his office of sheriff and committed to the Tower of London. His imprisonment was for but a short time; and on 13 May 1603, on the accession of James I, he was knighted. Later that year he was re-elected to Parliament as MP for Dunwich in place of Sir Valentine Knightley, who had chosen to sit for Northamptonshire.
In 1604 he was appointed one of the receivers for the Duchy of Cornwall, and, in June, to be special ambassador to the tsar of Russia. Like his grandfather, Sir Andrew Judde, Lord Mayor of London in 1550, who was one of the founders of the Muscovy Company, Smythe himself would seem to have been very interested in the Muscovy trade. Sailing from Gravesend on 13 June 1603, he and his party arrived at Archangel on 22 July and were conducted by way of Kholmogori and Vologhda Jenkinson, Anthony to Jaroslav, where the tsar then was. In the course of the winter he obtained a grant of new privileges for the company, and in the spring went on to Moscow, whence he returned to Archangel and sailed for England on 28 May 1604.
In 1603 he was re-elected governor of the East India Company, and, with one break in 1606–7, continued to hold the office till July 1621, during which time the company's trade was developed and established. In January 1618–19 he was appointed one of the commissioners for the settlement of the differences with the Dutch, which, however, after some years of discussion, remained, for the time, unsettled. His connection with the East India Company and the Muscovy Company led him to promote and support voyages for the discovery of the North-West Passage, and his name, as given by William Baffin to Smith's Sound, stands as a memorial to all time of his enlightened and liberal energy.
Smythe financed numerous Elizabethan era trade ventures and voyages of exploration during the early 17th century. In 1609 he obtained the charter for the Virginia Company, of which he was the treasurer until he resigned in 1620 after being charged with enriching himself at the expense of the company. The charges against him, which were urged with great virulence, were formally pronounced to be false and slanderous, though Smythe was not held to be altogether free from blame and the renewed inquiry was to continue until his death.
He was elected Member of Parliament for Sandwich in 1614 and for Saltash in 1622.
Smythe died at Sutton-at-Hone in Kent on 4 September 1625 and was buried in the local church, where there is an elaborate monument to his memory. The charges against him had met with no acceptance from the king; to the last he was consulted on all important matters relating to shipping and to eastern trade, and for several years was one of the chief commissioners of the navy, as also governor of the French and Somers Islands companies.
Private life.
Smythe amassed a large fortune, a considerable part of which he devoted to charitable purposes, and, among others, to the endowment of the free school of Tonbridge, which was originally founded by his grandfather, Sir Andrew Judd. He also established several charities for the poor of the parish of Tonbridge.
Smythe was three times married. The first two wives must have died comparatively young and without issue. He was already married to the third, Sarah, daughter of William Blount, when he was sheriff of London. By her he had one daughter (died unmarried in 1627) and three sons, two of whom seem to have predeceased their father. The eldest son, Sir John Smythe of Bidborough, married Isabella Rich, daughter of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick and Penelope Devereux and had issue, including Letitia Isabella Smythe (d. 1714), who married John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor.
The family, in the male line, ended with his great-great-grandson, Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe (1705–1778). The name, which is often spelt Smith, was always written Smythe by the man himself, as well as by the collateral family of Strangford.
A portrait belonging to the Skinners' Company has been identified with Smythe, though it has been supposed to be rather that of Sir Daniel Judd. An engraving by Simon Pass is inserted in the Grenville copy of Smith's ‘Voiage and Entertainment in Rushia’ (London, 1605, 4to). It is reproduced in Wadmore's memoir (1892).

Jan van Coninxloo or van Coninxlo, also known as Jan II or Jan the Younger, was born at Brussels in 1489 (?), but nothing is known of the details of his career. His father, who bore the same Christian name, had another son, Pieter van Coninxloo: both were painters. The name is found written in a variety of ways — Ccninxlo, Conninxlo, Connixlo, Cooninxloo, Conixloo — and sometimes with the additional name of Schemier. The Brussels Gallery contains five works by Jan van Coninxlo : a triptych of the 'Life of St. Anne,' which bears on its right wing (representing the death of that saint) the signature 'Jan van Conixlo 1546'; the 'Birth of St. Nicholas,' and the 'Death of St. Nicholas,' both of which were formerly in a church in Louvain; 'Christ among the Doctors,' and the 'Marriage at Cana.' These were formerly attributed to Gilles van Coninxlo.

Thomas Smith (soldier)

Thomas Smith (fl. 1600–1627), was an English soldier, of Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Smith as he styles himself on the title-page of the first edition (4to, 1600) of ‘The Art of Gunnery: wherein is set forth a number of serviceable secrets and practicall conclusions belonging to the Art of Gunnerie, by Arithmeticke skill to be accomplished: both pretie, pleasant and profitable for all such as are professors of the same facultie.’ In the dedication to Peregrine Bertie, lord Willoughby, ‘lord-governor of the town and castle of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and lord-warden of the east marches of England,’ he describes himself as ‘but one of the meanest soldiers in this garrison,’ though he claims to have been ‘brought up from childhood under a valiant captain in military profession, in which I have had a desire to practise and learn some secrets touching the orders of the field and training of soldiers, as also concerning the art of managing and shooting in great artillery.’ From the open preference which he gives to theory over practice it may be inferred that ‘he never buckled with the enemy in the field.’ In 1627 he published ‘Certain Additions to the Booke of Gunnery, with a Supply of Fire-Workes’ (4to), in which he still styles himself ‘Soldier of Berwick-upon-Tweed.’ 
He speaks also, in 1600, of having written ‘two or three years since,’ ‘“Arithmeticall Military Conclusions,” and bestowed on my Captain, Sir John Carie, knight: the which, God sparing my life, I mean to conect and enlarge and perhaps put to the press.’ It does not seem to have been published.

Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center

Introduction.
Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center, also referred to as MSIAC, is a NATO project funded directly by its member nations, not all of which are NATO members. There are currently 13 member nations: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States.
History.
Pilot-Nato Insensitive Munition Information Center (Pilot-NIMIC).
On May 26, 1988 the NATO nations France, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States based on a Memorandum of Understanding decided to create Pilot-NIMIC ("NIMIC = NATO Insensitive Munitions Information Center"). The organization was intended to assist national and international programs to develop insensitive munitions (IM). The idea for NIMIC was born at the NATO AC/310 “Workshop on Insensitive Munitions Information Exchange” in 1986 and was actively supported by the Chairman of AC/310, IGA M. Thévenin and Principal US Member of AC/310, Dr. R. Derr. The founding of this organization was promoted by former NATO Group AC/310 (Safety and Suitability for Service of Munitions and Explosives) in an effort to support munitions developers located in NATO countries. The PILOT-NIMIC office was located at Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, Maryland, USA. The initial team comprised a project manager and five technical specialists - basically the same structure MSIAC shows today (see below). Soon after its foundation Canada joined the project in late 1989.
NIMIC Move to Brussels and Growth.
After its first successful two years of operation the project moved to NATO Headquarters Brussels and officially became NIMIC on May 1, 1991. Spain and Australia entered the project in 1994, Portugal and Italy became members in 1995. In 1998 Portugal decided to leave NIMIC. Denmark entered the project 1999 but left soon after in 2004.
Merger of AC/258 and AC/310 and Transition to MSIAC.
In May 2003 the Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD) Ammunition Safety Group (AC/326) (CASG) was formed by a merger of former AC/258 Group of Experts on the Safety Aspects of Transportation and Storage of Military Ammunition and Explosives and the former AC/310 Group of Safety and Suitability for Service of Munitions and Explosives. With a given broader emphasis on Munitions Safety it was decided to modify NIMIC's scope to take this change into account. Hence its transition to Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center (MSIAC) began with the Pilot MSIAC phase in Spring 2003. The successful transition was accomplished by late 2004 and MSIAC was officially operational on December 15, 2004. Germany finally entered the project in 2005. Belgium entered MSIAC in 2013.
Organization.
The MSIAC Project Office consists of a Steering Committee, National Focal Point Officers (NFPO) and an Information Analysis Center (MSIAC). The Steering Committee is made up of one voting representative from each member nation and an elected chairman. It is responsible for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that established MSIAC and for developing its policy. This policy is carried out on a day-to-day basis by the MSIAC Project Manager.
Tasks.
The NATO Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center (MSIAC) ("Centre d'Analyse et d'Information sur la Securite des Munitions OTAN" in French)MSIAC provides technical consultancy services to its member nations in the area of munitions safety.
Areas with which MSIAC is concerned include:
Within these areas, MSIAC performs the following functions:

Andrew Tennant (pastoralist)

Andrew Tennant (20 June 1835 - 19 July 1913) was a Scottish-born Australian pastoralist, businessman and politician.
Early years.
Andrew was born on 20 June 1835 at Hawick, Roxburghshire, Scotland, to John Tennant and his wife Jessie Aitken. Soon after they migrated to South Australia with an assisted passage, arriving in either the "Duchess of Northumberland" or the "Duchess of Sutherland" with John Colton on 19 December 1839. Andrew was educated at E. W. Wickes' school in North Adelaide.
John began "pastoral pursuits", initially at Dry Creek on the Adelaide Plains, and then at Chain of Ponds in the Adelaide Hills, Lyndoch Valley in the Gumeracha district, and Burra. John became the first person to successfully move stock overland from Adelaide, via Port Augusta to Port Lincoln at the southern tip of Eyre Peninsula. He purchased Tallala station, from Port Lincoln, from a Mr. White of White Park, and raised cattle and sheep there for many years.
In 1853, Andrew commenced his own "pastoral pursuits", taking cattle west from Port Lincoln and settling for seven years on an abandoned site near Elliston, before owning several stations on southern Eyre Peninsula at Mount Wedge, Coffin Bay, and Streaky Bay.
On 28 August 1862 he married Rachael Christina Ferguson in Adelaide.
Pastoralist.
In 1866 he leased "Baroota" near Port Germein, and subsequently bought and sold a number of properties in the mid-north, north-east and far-north of South Australia, resulting in him owning a number of large stations of over in area. Although initially interested in cattle, he also developed an interest in sheep, and owned land further south near Riverton, and a number of stations in New Zealand. In 1880 his eldest son John moved to New Zealand where they took up 25,000 acres of pastoral land. Andrew also owned a number of properties in the city of Adelaide.
Businessman.
Tennant was a director of the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd. from its inception, a justice of the peace, a Freemason, and was heavily involved in breeding, raising and racing thoroughbred horses. He also held interests in coal mines and gold mines.
Politician.
From 1881-87 Tennant represented the seat of Flinders in the South Australian House of Assembly. He then moved to the Legislative Council where he represented the Northern District from 1898-1902.
Later years.
Tennant died of diabetes and senile dementia in his home, Essenside, (Moseley Street, Glenelg), on 19 July 1913, and was buried in the Brighton cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three daughters and three of his four sons.
John Tennant.
Eldest son John moved to New Zealand in 1880. In 1898 it was reported that "he has been residing there for the last 18 years, he took up 25,000 acres of pastoral land". In 1913 he was reported as "Mr. John Tennant of Princess Royal Station"; in 1939 as "John who lived at Kooringa".
F Tennant.
"Solicitor of Adelaide".
W Tennant.
"of Point Lowly station".
Rosina Forsyth Tennant.
Eldest daughter Rosina (Rosie) Forsyth Tennant was born at Port Lincoln. She married William Tennant Mortlock, (son of the late William Ranson Mortlock (1821–1884) of Avenel, Medindie), in a double-wedding with her sister on 28 January 1891 at St. Peter's Church, Glenelg.
Their first child, William Ranson Mortlock, was born in November 1891, but died at Essenside on 16 July 1892, aged 8½ months.
Rosie and W.T. had five sons in total and lived at Martindale Hall, Mintaro, but only one reached adulthood.
Following the death of her husband in 1913, her second son (John Andrew Tennant Mortlock, 1894–1950) returned to South Australia to control the expansive family estate. In 1926 they donated £2,000 to the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, and in 1936 they donated a further £25,000 to establish the "Ranson Mortlock Memorial Research Trust" at the Waite Institute in memory of her first son (William) Ranson Mortlock.
Mrs R.F. Mortlock died on 12 August 1939 at her home at Palmer Place, North Adelaide, and was buried at the North Road Cemetery, leaving her son John the sole surviving member of the Mortlock family. Of her own siblings, she was survived by her brother John who lived at Kooringa, and her two sisters.
John Andrew Tennant Mortlock.
In 1948 John discovered he had cancer. In December he married Dorothy Elizabeth Beech, (who had been managing the Mortlock Estate's accounts), at St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide. John died in 1950, and left a huge estate which was held in trust by his wife. The estate funded, amongst other things, the Mortlock Library of South Australiana. Dorothy died in 1979 - the marriage had produced no children.
Clayre Jessie Tennant.
Second daughter Clayre Jessie Tennant was a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (C.B.E.). On 6 January 1891 she became engaged to, and on 28 January 1891 in a double wedding with her sister at St. Peter's Church, Glenelg, she married, William Anstruther-Thomson (b. 6 September 1859, d. 17 April 1938, age 78) who, amongst many other things, was Aide-de-Camp to the Governor of South Australia from 1889-1891. After a wedding feast at Essenside, they sailed for England the next day. They settled in England and together had two or three children. In 1904 on succeeding to the Carntyne estate, William adopted the name of Gray, becoming William Anstruther-Gray of Kilmany and Carntyne. Their son William John St Clair Anstruther-Gray was born in 1905. Clayre died on 22 October 1958.
Adelaide Tennant.
Mrs. R. M. Hawker

Essenside Mansions.
Mrs A Tennant died on Friday 13 May 1921. Essenside was put up for auction on Tuesday 20 December 1921. The house was purchased by Mr. A. A. Heaslip who divided it into nine flats and named the building "Essenside Mansions".
The building was sold again in 1926, and again in 1930, but by now had become a "magnificent block of 10 self-contained flats". In the 1930s and 1940s, to spend one's summer holidays at Essenside Mansions was worthy of mention in the Advertiser's Social column. In July 1937 an announcement appeared in The Advertiser for "a bridge party for the St Peter's Glenelg Lacrosse Club" to be held at Essenside.
1972.

Hitz 247

Hitz 247 is a youth Contemporary hit radio-formatted internet radio station, based out of Melbourne, Victoria. Born out of former aspirant comunity station Hitz FM, the station began streaming online on 30 December 2011.
As well as providing programming that appeals to its young audience Hitz 247 also actively encourages young people to become involved with the station. Listeners are encouraged to produce and present radio programs and to contribute content to the stations website.
Hitz 247 also supports numerous non-profit youth organisations, increasing awareness of such organisations among its young listeners.
History.
Hitz 247 started broadcasting on the internet at 9am on Friday 30 December 2011. The first song played on the station was Zoe Badwi’s “Carry Me Home”.
In mid-2011 Hitz 247 conducted a survey called Build Your Own Radio Station. Over 1000 young Australians were surveyed about their musical preferences and radio listening habits. The responses formed the basis of the programming policies of Hitz 247.
Hitz 247 was inspired by Melbourne aspirant youth community radio station Hitz FM
Hitz FM.
Hitz FM was an aspirant youth-formatted community radio station in Melbourne, which ran a series of test broadcasts between 1992 and 2001 on the then-vacant frequency of 89.9 MHz FM. Ran predominantly by volunteers, the station limited involvement to people under the age of 30. In 2001, the Australian Broadcasting Authority chose SYN FM over Hitz FM for a youth license, and the station was disbanded.
Test Broadcasts
Notable Alumni.
Like Hitz 247, Hitz FM was a training ground for aspiring professional radio presenters. Notable Hitz FM alumni include:
Programming.
Hitz 247 relied upon the responses from its Build Your Own Radio Station survey in developing its playlist and programming at its launch in 2011.
The station plays mostly pop music and has a strong bias towards Australian music. Approximately half of the music played on Hitz 247 is by Australian artists. The station also features a lot of new music in its playlist.
The programs on Hitz 247 are all presented by people under the age of 30. As such, the programs are presented from a youth perspective. In order for Hitz 247 to exclude people over the age of 30 from participating in programming it sought government approval for an exemption under the Equal Opportunity Act.
Hitz 247 encourages unsigned Australian musicians to submit their musical recordings to the station for addition to its playlist. Aspiring radio presenters are encouraged to become involved in the stations programming.

The Salle des Concerts Herz, usually referred to simply as the Salle Herz, was a former concert hall in Paris, located at 48, rue de la Victoire. It was built in 1842 by the Austrian virtuoso pianist Henri Herz and his brother Jacques Herz.
The hall was used for public performances. Hector Berlioz conducted the premières of two of his compositions there – the overture "Le Carnaval romain" on 3 February 1844 and "L'enfance du Christ" on 10 December 1854. Offenbach's 'tableau villageois' "Le trésor à Mathurin" was performed there 'in concert' on 7 May 1853, and Offenbach himself performed there as a cellist. 
The first public performance of the saxophone took place there on 3 February 1844.
Non-musical events were also held in the hall. An anti-slavery conference was held there on 27 August 1867 by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.
The Salle Herz was still being used to mount concerts by Jules Danbé in 1874 but was subsequently demolished.

Meiningen station

Meiningen station is a junction of four railways and with its facilities is one of the most important railway stations in southern Thuringia, Germany.
It consists of two once separate stations, the former Prussian station as a through station on the Werra Railway and the Bavarian station as a terminal station on the Schweinfurt–Meiningen line.
Location.
Meininger station is located at the 60.69 km mark of the Werra Railway (from Eisenach) and at the 77.90 km mark of the Schweinfurt–Meiningen line (from Schweinfurt). The station is located on the eastern edge of the city of Meiningen next to the English Garden and separates the city centre from the Oststadt district. The old town and many public facilities such as the Meiningen Theatre, Schloss Elisabethenburg (castle), hotels and the law courts are located nearby.
History.
The plan for the construction of a railway station in Meiningen was developed as early as 1838, as part of the first project for a railway line through the Werra valley. The site for the railway tracks was originally in the northwest of the town at the foot of the Herrenberge mountain, but this project fell through. 20 years later after a construction period of two years the station was inaugurated on 2 November 1858 at its present location with the opening of the Werra Railway. The station was the seat of the Werra Railway Company (), which had received the concession for the construction and operation of the Werra Railway. At its opening, the station already consisted of the station building and six other buildings, including a locomotive depot with a repair shop and coke, carriage and freight sheds. To meet the ever increasing need for maintenance and repair work storage sidings were built on the Werra line. In 1863 a rail depot was built with a roundhouse and a turntable opposite the entrance building, requiring the locomotive shed to be partly demolished.
On 15 December 1874 the Royal Bavarian State Railways, put the Schweinfurt–Meiningen line into operation. It built south of the existing Werra Railway station a separate "Bavarian" station ("Bayerischen Bahnhof") as a terminus, with entrance building, platforms, a locomotive depot with five stalls, a turntable and other tracks. The two sections of the station were connected by two sets of points only. This nearly doubled the railway premises, which extended now for over 1,300 metres between the two connecting tracks at each end. As the number of tracks at the crossing of the Marienstraße increased from two to ten, controlling traffic with barriers was no longer considered reasonable. So a 100 metre long tunnel was built, crossing under the railway tracks and platforms, connecting the city centre and the Oststadt district with one another. The construction of the Bavarian station and the tunnel made it necessary to lower Marienstraße and the connecting road network and to carry out large changes in the wider environment of the station. So the street network to the east of the railway property had to be rearranged and the road to Rohr was rebuilt on a new alignment.
With the opening of the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway in 1884, the station was on a long-distance route connecting Berlin with Stuttgart via Erfurt and Würzburg. In 1895, the Prussian state railways acquired the Werra Railway and its railway facilities became the "Prussian" station ("Preußischen Bahnhof"). By 1900, a one-storey building wing, a new station hall with a staircase and a loading ramp were built between the Prussian and Bavarian buildings. The adjoining workshop has developed by 1900 into a connected building complex, 200 metres long, with 26 locomotive stalls and a number of workshops and other facilities. As the capacities of the main workshop soon reached their limits, in 1914 the Prussian state railway built a new main workshop, one km north of the station, later called "RAW Meiningen" and now operating as Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works. The old main workshop was dismantled and converted back into a train depot. In the following years all platforms were extended and provided with canopies except for platform 2.
After the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the whole station became part of the Railway Administration of Erfurt ("Reichsbahndirektion Erfurt"). The depot was enlarged and given a larger turntable. In the southern part of the railway property a storage tank was built for the supply of fuel to petrol stations. In the Second World War the station was damaged in an American air attack during Operation Clarion, including the destruction of the southern railway tracks, a road bridge over them, signal box 4 and the tank farm. After the war, in July 1945, the line to Schweinfurt was closed at the Inner German border. On this line, trains ran only as far as Rentwertshausen and Römhild. The locomotive depot of the former Bavarian state railway was rebuilt as a coal yard. The Soviet Army built a loading ramp for heavy military equipment between the freight depot and the engine depot.
In 1960, the last major renovation of the passenger station was carried out. In place of the old station hall, a new hall was built with ticket counters, baggage lockers, Mitropa, newspaper shop, kiosk, toilets and later an Intershop. A grand staircase now led to the station forecourt.
After the construction of the Inner German border, East German railways developed new long distance services in East Germany. Meiningen station was now the start and end point for express and semi-fast trains to Erfurt, Halle, Leipzig, Berlin, Dresden–Görlitz and Stralsund–Barth (Ostsee). Railway traffic and passenger number increased greatly from 1960 to 1989. The daily number of trains increased to more than 200 trains.
Diesel locomotives were stationed at the depot from 1967. Around 1970, the "Städteschnellverkehr" (“city rapid”) service to Berlin was abandoned. From 25 October 1976 the "Städteexpress" (“city express”) service "Rennsteig" ran between Berlin and Meiningen. The relatively small station was now congested and often two trains departed simultaneously from a platform. In 1980 a new roundhouse with 12 locomotive stalls and a turntable was inaugurated at the railway depot. Furthermore, a new carriage washing facility was opened in the Bavarian part of the station.
After German reunification in 1990 and the reopening of the Meiningen–Schweinfurt line in 1991, the first new express services were established from Berlin via Meiningen to Würzburg or Schweinfurt. After the closure of these services by Deutsche Bahn at the end of the 1990s, Meiningen station increasingly lost its importance. The city built a new bus station in 1998 adjacent to the railway land near platforms 1 and 2, offering travellers good connections between buses and trains. The tank farm and the coal yard at the locomotive depot of the Bavarian station were demolished. The Meiningen base fire station was built in their place.
In 2001 Deutsche Bahn transferred regional rail services in the southern Thuringia area to "Süd-Thüringen-Bahn" (STB), founded in 1999. Its new rail routes and operations were based in Meiningen station. STB took over the depot in the same year and has used it since then as a maintenance facility and business headquarters. Since 2004, "Erfurter Bahn" (EB) has operated the "Unterfranken-Shuttle", a new direct rail link between Meiningen and Schweinfurt. The "Unterfranken-Shuttle" uses the tracks and platforms of the Bavarian station as well as the Meininger station as the location of its business operations. The Bavarian section of the station is also used for parking Deutsche Bahn Regional-Express trains. On the 150th anniversary of the Werra Railway on 2 November 2008, a memorial plaque was attached to the station building.
The station.
Entrance building.
The station building is a neoclassical building and consists of two parts. The larger northern building was opened in 1858 for the Werra Railway and was taken over by the Prussian state railway in 1895. The southern building was built by the Royal Bavarian State Railways in 1874 with the opening of the Schweinfurt–Meiningen line. In 1900, the two buildings were joined with a single-storey low-rise building, which includes the station concourse and its service facilities. The entrance building contains the following customer facilities: travel agency/ticketing, ticket machines, bakery and snack bar, waiting area and a games room. The building also accommodates the operations of the "Süd-Thüringen-Bahn" and the "Erfurter Bahn" companies, as well as operations of the Southeastern Regional Area of DB Netze, based in Leipzig. In front of the station building there is an office serving taxi customers and next to it is the Meiningen bus station. In the station forecourt there are parking spaces for cycles and cars.
Tracks and platforms.
With a length of 1.3 km, the station area covers an area of ten hectares. It has 41 tracks with a total length of 9,222 m. 13 of these tracks are in the Bavarian part of the station. The longest track is track 2 at 937 m, the shortest is the connecting track V66 at 10 m. The passenger station consists of a through station with platform tracks 1, 1a and 2 and a terminal station with platform tracks 3 and 4. There is barrier-free access to all platforms. The platforms have the following destinations, lengths and heights:
Other parts of the station.
On the east side of the railway property is the former goods yard. A sales outlet and a workshop are now located there. On the west side there is a rail freight unloading yard and the Bavarian part of the station, which is mainly used as a train depot for the "Unterfranken-Shuttle", "Erfurter Bahn" and "Deutsche Bahn" Regional-Expresses. For the ease of operations there are three signal boxes, a fourth has been closed. Opposite the entrance building is the Meiningen depot. It is used for the permanent establishment of the "Süd-Thüringen-Bahn". Furthermore, a Federal Police station is established in the Bavarian station, which was in a very poor condition in 2009. From January 2010, the DB reconstructed the platforms and shelters, but not the entrance building.
Passenger operations.
With 96 trains a day (weekdays, as of 2010), Meiningen station has direct Regional-Express (RE) and Regionalbahn (RB) connections on four lines to the following places:

The Double Headed Hawk Moth ("Coequosa triangularis") is a species of moth of the Sphingidae family. It is known from New South Wales and Queensland.
The wingspan is about 130 mm, making it Australia's largest Hawk Moth. Adults are yellow and brown with broad wavy markings.
The larvae feed on "Banksia ericifolia", "Grevillea robusta", "Hakea dactyloides", "Macadamia integrifolia", "Persoonia levis" and "Stenocarpus sinuatus". The head is an orange conical structure, but on its tail are two large raised black knobs. These look like a pair of large eyes, so that an observer or predator finds it difficult to determine which end is actually the head. The body is green or yellow, often with yellow diagonal stripes and sometimes with purplish lateral markings. It is covered in soft short pale spines. Full-grown larvae are about 100 mm long.

Gibraltar Regulatory Authority

The Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA) was established by the Gibraltar Regulatory Act in October 2000. The GRA is the statutory body in Gibraltar responsible for regulating electronic communications. This includes telecommunications, radio communications and broadcasting transmissions. The GRA serves as both the national supervisory and regulatory authority for these sectors. The supervision and regulation of these sectors is done in accordance with EU law that has been rendered into national law.
Since inception the GRA has seen its responsibilities extended to data protection and gambling.
Electronic Communication.
The GRA attempts to enhance competition in the communications sector by regulating network access to develop effective choice for business and residential consumers alike and by helping the facilitate entry to the communications market through authorizations and licenses.
The GRA policy is designed to make Gibraltar recognizable as a world-class telecommunications centre to do business. As well as ensuring that Gibraltar has a high quality telecommunications service that offers consumers a better deal by providing high performance and standards, as well as competitive prices.
The Communications remit of the GRA includes: traditional telephone wire, dial up and ADSL internet, mobile operators providing voice and data services, VOIP services, television and radio, radio communications including fixed wireless services, and licensing frameworks for satellite services.
Data Protection.
The Gibraltar Government nominated the GRA as the Supervisory Authority for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act 2004. With the powers imbued upon the Data Protection Commissioner, the GRA has made assurances that a system is in place to monitior the executory function of the Data Protection Act. The GRA works closely with foreign regulatory authorities tasked with a similar role. The GRA also continuously develops a comprehensive online guide that is designed to encompass the wealth of information available about Data Protection.
Gambling.
On the day the Gambling Act 2005 came into operation (26 October 2006), the GRA was appointed to the position of Gambling Commissioner. It is the objective of the Commissioner to ensure licence holders conduct business within the terms of the licences and in accordance with the Gambling Act 2005; and that business is conducted by licence holders in a manner that maintains the good reputation of Gibraltar as a first tier jurisdiction.
The Gambling Act of 2005 was brought in to replace the Gaming Act, that was originally enacted in 1958. The 2005 act was designed to modernize Gibraltar's legislation and to create a statutory licensing and regulatory framework to match Gibraltar's status as the "home to the world's leading online gambling operators".
Independent Testing and Auditing.
In order to be granted a license by the GRA an online gambling operator must undergo verification by an approved testing and auditing body to ensure it complies with legislation and standards. 
The systems that are required to undergo testing or auditing are: the random number generator (RNG), payment protocols (deposit/withdrawal), gambling assistance programs, and player dispute resolution systems. However tests and audits of the following are not performed: systems security, game evaluations, game payout calculations, live dealer systems, and segmented player funds.

Web audience measurement

Web Audience Measurement (WAM) is an audience measurement and website analytics tool that measures Internet usage in India. The system, a joint effort of IMRB International and Internet and Mobile Association of India surveys over 6000 individuals across 8 metropolitan centers in India and tracks a variety of metrics such as time-on-site, exposure, reach and frequency of Internet usage.
WAM uses audience measurement and is a continuous tracking panel study that provides cross sectional data on Internet usage segmented by gender, SEC and location. This panel-based approach uses metering technology, design for an Indian context that tracks computers.
Web Rating Points factor multiple measures of Internet usage to provide a more comprehensive picture to web advertisers and attempts to standardize web analytics in India. The web analytics market in India is currently fragmented, with Comscore and Vizisense being IMRB's key competitors. Several discussions revolve around the difference between the numbers provided by all the competitors in the digital audience measurement space. Therefore choosing the right measurement partner is imperative for media stakeholders. This creates rifts between users of two different audience measurement tools.

In August 1935 he set new Scottish and British records with a total distance of 244¾ miles in the West Scotland T.T.A 12-hour event. The West of Scotland time trial was run over a 211 mile route around the coast with incursions inland in the Linwood area, followed by laps around a 7 mile circuit that was calibrated by the time keepers. Jackie Bone exceeded the marked distance by so much that he had to be sent off in the direction of Paisley over cobbled streets to finish his 12 hours. Later the same day, in England, an English rider finished a 12 hour event with a greater distance to set a new record, so he was the British Record Holder for only a short period.
In 1936 he finished second in the 'Manx International Cycle Road Race', run over the 37.75 mile TT course on the Isle of Man.
On May 29, 1937 he won the 17 mile road race at the "Sunday Pictorial" Cycling Festival, held at Alexandra Palace in London. In front of 10,000 people and television cameras, and against opposition that included Hubert Opperman, Percy Stallard, Bill Messer, 'Shake' Earnshaw and 'Ernie' Hussey, he broke away on lap 3 of the 11 lap race and survived until the finish.
The Golden Book.
Bone's achievements were celebrated in 1936 when Cycling Weekly awarded him his own page in the Golden Book of Cycling, which is now held in 'The Pedal Club' archive.

Naval Air Station New Iberia

Naval Air Station New Iberia, located near New Iberia, Louisiana, was a short-lived training facility of the United States Navy which operated for a mere five years in the 1960s.
The naval base at New Iberia was actually designated NAAS, indicating that it was a Naval Auxiliary Air Station.
History.
The site of NAAS New Iberia had served as a civil airport between 1946 and 1954. In 1954 the Department of Defense selected the airport for development as a naval air station.
Due to the runway length requirements of naval jet aircraft, a total of 4,000 acres were purchased by the Federal Government and an 8,002-foot concrete runway, Runway 16/34, was constructed. Commissioned in 1960, Naval Auxiliary Air Station New Iberia was located on US-90 just outside of New Iberia and covered an area of 4,347 acres of land and had an elevation of 24 feet. 
With the opening of NAAS New Iberia, its primary flying unit, Advanced Training Unit-B moved from Naval Air Station Kingsville / South Field, Texas and was redesignated as Training Squadron TWENTY SEVEN (VT-27). Operating Grumman TS-2A Trackers, the squadron conducted advanced multiengine training for Student Naval Aviators destined for carrier-based A-1 Skyraider, S-2 Tracker and E-1 Tracer aircraft, and land-based naval aircraft and seaplanes, primarily those engaged in airborne early warning mission flying the EC-121 Warning Star, and those in the patrol and anti-submarine warfare mission, such as the P-2 Neptune, P5M Marlin, and the new P-3 Orion that began coming on line in the early 1960s. 
Approximately 1,000 military personnel and 100 civilian workers were stationed at NAAS New Iberia in 1964, including those assigned to VT-27. Naval Auxiliary Air Station New Iberia continued to function until 1964 when the Navy began closing the facility. On 29 September 1964, VT-27 transferred to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas, with the squadron instructor pilots flying out the TS-2 Trackers. NAS New Iberia was finally closed in January 1965.
Upon the closure of the naval field, the Iberia Parish governing body petitioned the U.S. government for release of 2,100 acres of air station property for civil aviation use. The petition was granted in 1970 and the airport was given its present name, Acadiana Regional Airport. The Acadiana Regional Airport is presently classified as a General Aviation Transport airport by the FAA. By definition, the airport is capable of serving all classes of aircraft.
A variety of aviation-related businesses are located at the airport. Numerous helicopters and seaplanes utilize the airport in support of the offshore petroleum industry in the Gulf of Mexico. Commercial passenger service is provided by a number of charter operators at the airport.

A Night Out (musical)

A Night Out is a musical comedy with a book by George Grossmith, Jr. and Arthur Miller, music by Willie Redstone and Cole Porter and lyrics by Clifford Grey. The story is adapted from the 1894 French comedy "L'Hôtel du libre échange" by Georges Feydeau and Maurice Desvallières. The sculptor Pinglet gets an evening away from his domineering wife and dines with the attractive Marcelle Delavaux. After a series of coincidences and mix-ups, he manages the deception without suffering any adverse consequences.
The musical was presented with success at the Winter Garden Theatre, London, from 1920 to 1921 and then toured in Britain.
History.
In 1896, "A Night Out", a non-musical adaptation of "L'Hôtel du libre échange", opened in London and ran for 500 nights. The musical adaptation, produced by George Grossmith, Jr and Edward Laurillard, followed the story of the earlier adaptation (and the French original) closely. The score was by the resident conductor of the Winter Garden Theatre, Willie Redstone, with music for additional numbers provided by the young Cole Porter as some of his earliest professional work. 
The musical was first presented at the Winter Garden Theatre, London, on 18 September 1920 and ran for 309 performances, closing on 18 June 1921. A touring company presented the piece in the British provinces in 1921, with Norman Griffin in the lead as Pinglet. In 1925, the musical was produced in the U.S.
Synopsis.
The sculptor Joseph Pinglet is henpecked by his domineering wife, and is ready to rebel by a little unauthorised outing. He intends to dine with the attractive Marcelle Delavaux, the neglected fiancée of Maurice Paillard, in a private room at the Hotel Pimlico. Madame Pinglet has been summoned to visit her sick sister, but she locks Pinglet in his studio before she leaves. Pinglet uses the bell-pull as a rope and escapes by the balcony.
Pinglet and Marcelle have arrived at the hotel. Unknown to them, their fellow guests include Monsieur Matthieu and his four young daughters, who are given a room that is reputed to be haunted. By an oversight, the same room has also been allotted to Maurice Paillard, who is intent on an intimate evening with Victorine, the Pinglets' maid. Pinglet and Marcelle are disturbed by frantic banging on their door and the voice of Paillard, who has been terrified at finding in his room four figures in white – Matthieu's daughters – who he assumes are ghosts. The confusion is compounded by a police raid. The police take the names of all present. Victorine gives her name as Madame Pinglet.
Back at his studio, Pinglet climbs in just before his wife returns. She is very dishevelled from a traffic accident. The summonses arrive from the police. Pinglet sees Mme. Pinglet's name on one of them and turns on his bewildered wife and upbraids her for her licentious behaviour. The police arrive with the others who have been at the hotel. In the ensuing row over Victorine's imposture, Pinglet's and Marcelle's part in the evening's events are overlooked and they escape any adverse consequences of their night out.
Critical reception.
"The Times" wrote, "With Mr. Henson "A Night Out" is one of the brightest things of its kind which we have had for a very long time, and even without him it would still be a first-class entertainment." In "The Observer", St. John Ervine was lukewarm, commenting that, "those who like this kind of stuff … can be certain that the wit will not make any demand on the intelligence, and provided they have eaten and drunk lavishly they will probably enjoy it. "The Illustrated London News" thought the success of the piece principally due to Henson's performance, calling him "a little genius".
In "The Manchester Guardian", during the musical's provincial tour, Samuel Langford wrote that the plot was "a comparative masterpiece" by the usual standard of musical comedy, and the music "quite witty and graceful by the same comparisons."

Nicolas Loufrani

Nicolas Loufrani (born December 17, 1971 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) is the CEO of the Smiley Company, which owns the trademark and copyright over the Smiley face and name in over 100 countries.
The Smiley Company.
In London in 1996, Nicolas Loufrani and his father, French journalist Franklin Loufrani, started the Smiley licensing company, taking back all pre-existing trademark rights Franklin Loufrani had maintained in the Smiley logo since 1971.
Growing the Smiley brand.
Nicolas Loufrani extended the registration of the brand name and began to associate the logo more closely with the name by creating a new brand identity for labels, packaging, catalogs, and similar articles. He also set up worldwide representation and provided support for all licensing partners, through a comprehensive brand strategy. The intention was to establish the logo on the same level as other iconic logos such as the Nike Swoosh, or the Lacoste Crocodile.
Graphical Emoticons.
By 1997 the younger Loufrani was creating new designs for the company's products resulting in many variations of the original Smiley logo. These icons were posted as .gif files on the Web in 1998. They were also published as the official "Smiley Dictionary", with each one replacing a pre-existing Emoticon made up of punctuation marks. The intention was to allow people to use colourful icons to enhance their texts, instead of plain punctuation.
Wal-Mart dispute.
In 2001 The Smiley Company entered into a long legal dispute in the United States with the supermarket brand Wal-Mart, which claimed to be the owner of the rights over the original figurative brand. This conflict did not involve any disagreement over the rights to the icons created by Nicolas Loufrani, or the "Smiley" brand name. The case was eventually settled between both parties in 2010, before a Federal court in Chicago, on undisclosed terms.
A combination of the company's prior work and the profile generated by the court case resulted in high awarenes of the Smiley logo, and new partners were licensed to brand products like clothing, perfume, plush, stationery and to run promotional campaigns.
SmileyWorld Association.
In 2005 the Loufranis established a charity, "The SmileyWorld Association" (SWA). Nicolas Loufrani then took the decision to commercialize ethical products, by using organic cotton for clothing, fair trade sourcing and by turning over some company profits to the SmileyWorld Association.
Partnerships and Concept Stores.
Nicolas Loufrani has established partnerships with high-profile designers like Tommy Hilfiger, Ora ito, and Jean Charles de Castelbajac, and "Smiley" started to appear in famous concept stores such as Colette in Paris, Fred Segal in Los Angeles, Henry Bendel in New York and Stierblut in Munich.
In December 2011, the first Smiley concept store was opened, in London.
Financial Ranking.
The Smiley Company is one of the 100 biggest licensing companies in the world and had a turnover of $167 million in 2012.

Elizabeth Hartley (actress)

Elizabeth Hartley (née White) (1750?–1824) was one of the most celebrated actors on the London stage in the 1700s. She was also notorious for the role she played in society scandals including "The Vauxhall Affray".
Life.
Elizabeth Hartley was the daughter of James and Eleanor White of Berrow, Somerset, England. She later took the name Hartley, but it is not known from whom. Various suggestions have been made including the master to whom she was a chambermaid, and other actors of a similar name. There are also no reliable sources for her early roles until she appeared in Edinburgh, on 4 December 1771, as Monimia in Thomas Otway's "The Orphan".
After a season in Edinburgh she moved to Bristol where David Garrick, who had heard of her remarkable beauty, commissioned the actor John Moody to attend a performance and report back to him. On 20 July 1772, Moody wrote: Mrs. Hartley is a good figure, with a handsome, small face, and very much freckled; her hair red, and her neck and shoulders well turned. There is not the least harmony in her voice, but when forced (which she never fails to do on every occasion) is loud and strong, but such an inarticulate gabble that you must be well acquainted with her part to understand her. She is ignorant and stubborn... She has a husband, a precious fool, who she heartily despises. She talks lusciously, and has a slovenly good nature about her that renders her prodigiously vulgar. 
Since she was by this time already engaged to play at the Covent Garden theatre, this poor review was of no account.
Meanwhile Hartley had been living at the premises of Mrs Kelly, a well-known bawd and it can be assumed was also working for her.
Her first appearance at the Covent Garden theatre was as Jane Shore on 5 October 1772. It was said concerning her debut that "she is deserving of much praise, her figure is quite elegant, her countenance pleasing and expressive, her voice in general melodious, and her action just." 
However, writing about her performance in her next role as Queen Catherine in "Henry VIII" the same journal wrote that she had "frequently sunk into a whining monotony which from the length of some of the speeches became very disagreeable".<br>
These mixed reviews which praised her beauty but criticised her acting continued after she played Orellana: "her beautiful figure and sweet face, made every auditor wish that nature had given her a voice less dissonant, and monotonous".
In the summer of 1773 the events that became known as "The Vauxhall Affray" took place. A group of young men including Thomas Lyttelton, the notorious libertine, George Robert FitzGerald and Captain Crofts were involved in a drunken brawl which started in the Vauxhall Gardens where Hartley was walking with Rev Henry Bate (later Lord Dudley). Bate became incensed by the rudeness of the young men in staring at and making remarks about Hartley. Insults were exchanged, threats were made, and a duel was proposed. The affair culminated with a boxing match in a tavern. Owing to the notoriety of the people involved these events stimulated extensive debate and gossip and a pamphlet was published and circulated.
In the following summer of 1774 Hartley again made the headlines when she absconded to France with William Smith who played her on-stage lover in "Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond". They travelled on to Cork, Ireland where they acted together. They both returned to London for the autumn season.
Her looks were more often praised than her acting, but she was popular with audiences. Her portrait was depicted by many artists including Joshua Reynolds, George Romney, John Downman, John Keyse Sherwin and Angelica Kauffman.
"She was a very beautiful woman, and a good actress in parts that were not beyond her powers; her forte was tenderness, not rage".
"A finer creature than Mrs Hartley I never saw – her make is perfect." 
"Mrs Hartley, who in all her golden beauty acted the lovely interest of Miss Neville. The author could not have wished a more perfect face and form ..." 
She worked at the Covent Garden theatre in a numerous roles until 1780 (see below), and also appeared at Drury Lane, Liverpool and Stroud. 
She left the stage at the close of the season of 1779–80 when aged only 30, possibly due to ill health. There is no record of the rest of her life until she died at King Street, Woolwich, 1 Feb 1824. She was buried on 6 February under the name of White. Her will left £100 to the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund.

<doc id="31034220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31034220" title="Genetic history of North Africa">
Genetic history of North Africa

The genetic history of North Africa has been heavily influenced by geography. 
The Sahara desert to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the North were important barriers to gene flow in prehistoric times. However Eurasia and Africa form a single land mass at the Suez. At the Straits of Gibraltar, Africa and Europe are separated by only . At periods of low sea-levels, such as during a glacial maximum, islands that are currently submerged would appear in the Mediterranean and possibly in between the Gibraltar straits.
These may have encouraged humans to "island hop" between Africa and Europe. During wetter phases of the Sahara, Sub-Saharan Africans would have expanded into North Africa. West Asian populations would have also been attracted to a wet Sahara. West Asian populations could also migrate into Africa via the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.
As a result of these geographic influences, the genetic profile of Berber populations is a complex mosaic of European, Sub-Saharan African and West Asian influences. Though North Africa has experienced gene-flow from the surrounding regions, it has also experienced long periods of genetic isolation, allowing a distinctive genetic markers to evolve in Berber populations.
Current scientific debate is concerned with determining the relative contributions of different periods of gene flow to the current gene pool of North Africans. Anatomically modern humans are known to have been present in North Africa during the Upper Paleolithic 45,000 years ago as attested by the Aterian culture. With no apparent continuity, 22,000 years ago, the Aterian was succeeded by the Iberomaurusian culture which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. The Iberomaurusian was succeeded by the Capsian, a pre-neolithic culture. About 9,000 years ago the Saharan entered a wet phase which attracted Neolithic peoples from the Near East and Sub-Saharan Africans. In historic times, North Africa was occupied by several peoples including Phoenicians (814–146 BCE), Romans (146 BCE–439 CE), Vandals (439–534 CE),and Byzantines (534–647 CE). In the 7th Century a migration of Bedouin peoples from the Arabian peninsula brought Arabic language into North Africa.
Y-chromosome.
Haplogroup E is the most prevalent haplogroup amongst the Berbers accounting for up to 87 percent of Y-chromosomes among some Berber populations. Haplogroup E is thought to have emerged in East-Africa and would have later dispersed into North Africa and Eurasia. The major sub-clades of haplogroup E found amongst Berbers belong to E1b1b1 which is believed to have emerged in East Africa. Common subclades include, E1b1b1a, E1b1b1b and E1b1b1*. E1b1b1b is distributed along a west-to-east cline with frequencies which can reach as high as 80 percent in Northwest Africa. E1b1b1a has been observed at low to moderate frequencies among Berber populations with significantly higher frequencies observed in Northeast Africa relative to Northwest Africa.
Eurasian haplogroups such as Haplogroup J and Haplogroup R1 have also been observed at moderate frequencies. A thorough study by Arredi et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Algeria concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both J1 and E3b2 main haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin, which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Berber–speaking pastoralists from the Middle East 
E1b1b1b (E-M81); formerly E3b1b, E3b2.
E1b1b1b (E-M81) is the most common Y chromosome haplogroup in North Africa, dominated by its sub-clade E-M183. It is thought to have originated in North Africa 5,600 years ago. The parent clade E1b1b originated in East Africa. Colloquially referred to as the Berber marker for its prevalence among Mozabite, Middle Atlas, Kabyle people and other Amazigh groups, E-M81 is also quite common among North African groups. It reaches frequencies of up to 80 percent in some parts of the Maghreb. This includes the Saharawish for whose men reports that approximately 76 percent are M81+.
This haplogroup is also found of some amounts in the Iberian Peninsula, probably due to ancient migrations during the Islamic, Roman, and Carthaginian empires, as well as the influence of Sephardic Jews. In Iberia generally it is more common than E1b1b1a (E-M78), unlike in the rest of Europe, and as a result this E-M81 is found throughout Latin America and among Hispanic men in USA. As an exceptional case in Europe, this sub-clade of E1b1b1 has also been observed at 40 percent the Pasiegos from Cantabria.
Another theory by Gonçalves suggests that since the percentage of E in Iberia is high in areas with little to no Moorish/Berber settlement, such as Galicia, Castile and Cantabria, that the lineage may have been brought to Iberia by Neolithic or Mesolithic migrations. The cause for such migrations may have been the drying out of the Sahara and the movement of populations from Northwest Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar northward to more temperate Iberia. This theory suggests a long history of transnational relations between Iberia and the Maghreb. More research is required in determining how close the subclades of E carried by Iberian men are related to Maghrebis, and whether they are the exact same subclade. This would help to determine whether E-M81's presence in Iberia is prehistoric or from more recent periods such the Islamic civilization of Al-Andalus.
In smaller numbers, E-M81 men can be found in Sudan, Lebanon, Turkey, and among Sephardic Jews.
There are two recognized sub-clades, although one is much more important than the other.
Mitochondrial DNA.
Individuals receive mtDNA only from their mothers. According to Macaulay et al. 1999, "one-third of Mozabite Berber mtDNAs have a Near Eastern ancestry, probably having arrived in North Africa less than 50,000 years ago, and one-eighth have an origin in sub-Saharan Africa. Europe appears to be the source of many of the remaining sequences, with the rest having arisen either in Europe or in the Near East." Maca-Meyer et al. 2003 analyze the "autochthonous North African lineage U6" in mtDNA, and conclude that:
A genetic study by "Fadhlaoui-Zid et al. 2004" argues concerning certain exclusively North African haplotypes that "expansion of this group of lineages took place around 10,500 years ago in North Africa, and spread to neighbouring population", and apparently that a specific Northwestern African haplotype, U6, probably originated in the Near East 30,000 years ago but has not been highly preserved and accounts for 6-8 percent in southern Moroccan Berbers, 18 percent in Kabyles and 28 percent in Mozabites. Rando et al. 1998 (as cited by [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v68n4/002582/002582.html]) "detected female-mediated gene flow from sub-Saharan Africa to NW Africa" amounting to as much as 21.5 percent of the mtDNA sequences in a sample of NW African populations; the amount varied from 82 percent (Tuaregs) to 4 percent (Rifains). This north-south gradient in the sub-Saharan contribution to the gene pool is supported by "Esteban et al."
Nevertheless, individual Berber communities display a considerably high mtDNA heterogeneity among them. The Berbers of Jerba Island, located in South Eastern Tunisia, display an 87 percent Eurasian contribution with no U6 haplotypes, while the Kesra of Tunisia, for example, display a much higher proportion of typical sub-Saharan mtDNA haplotypes (49 percent), as compared to the Zriba (8 percent). According to the article, "The North African patchy mtDNA landscape has no parallel in other regions of the world and increasing the number of sampled populations has not been accompanied by any substantial increase in our understanding of its phylogeography. Available data up to now rely on sampling small, scattered populations, although they are carefully characterized in terms of their ethnic, linguistic, and historical backgrounds. It is therefore doubtful that this picture truly represents the complex historical demography of the region rather than being just the result of the type of samplings performed so far."
Additionally, recent studies have discovered a close mitochondrial link between Berbers and the Saami of Scandinavia which confirms that the Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe was the source of late-glacial expansions of hunter-gatherers that repopulated northern Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum and reveals a direct maternal link between those European hunter-gatherer populations and the Berbers. With regard to Mozabite Berbers, one-third of Mozabite Berber mtDNAs have a Near Eastern ancestry, probably having arrived in North Africa ∼50,000 years ago, and one-eighth have an origin in sub-Saharan Africa. Europe appears to be the source of many of the remaining sequences, with the rest having arisen either in Europe or in the Near East."
According to the most recent and thorough study about Berber mtDNA from Coudray et al. 2008 that analysed 614 individuals from 10 different regions (Morocco (Asni, Bouhria, Figuig, Souss), Algeria (Mozabites), Tunisia (Chenini-Douiret, Sened, Matmata, Jerba) and Egypt (Siwa)) the results may be summarized as follows :
The Berber mitochondrial pool is characterized by an overall high frequency of Western Eurasian haplogroups, a somehow lower frequency of sub-Saharan L lineages, and a significant (but differential) presence of North African haplogroups U6 and M1.
Until recently, some papers suggested that the distribution of the main L haplogroups in North Africa was mainly due to trans-Saharan slave trade. However in September 2010, a thorough study about Berber mtDNA by Frigi "et al." concluded that most of L haplogroups were much older and introduced by an ancient African gene flow around 20,000 years ago.
Autosomal DNA.
In January 13 th 2012, an exhaustive genetic study of North Africa's human populations was published in PLoS Genetics and was undertaken jointly by researchers in the Evolutionary Biology Institute (CSIC-UPF) and Stanford University, among other institutions.
The study reveals that the genetic composition of North Africa's human populations is extremely complex, and the result of a local component dating back thirteen thousand years and the varied genetic influence of neighbouring populations on North African groups during successive migrations. According to David Comas, coordinator of the study and researcher at the Institute for Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-UPF), "some of the questions we wanted to answer were whether today's inhabitants are direct descendants of the populations with the oldest archaeological remains in the region, dating back fifty thousand years, or whether they are descendants of the Neolithic populations in the Middle East which introduced agriculture to the region around eight thousand years ago. We also wondered if there had been any genetic exchange between the North African populations and the neighbouring regions and if so, when these took place".
To answer these questions, the researchers analyzed around 800,000 genetic markers, distributed throughout the entire genome in 125 North African individuals belonging to seven representative populations in the whole region, and the information obtained was compared with the information from the neighbouring populations.
The results of this study show that there is a native genetic component which defines North Africans. In-depth study of these markers, shows that the people inhabiting North Africa today are not descendants of either the earliest occupants of this region fifty thousand years ago, or descendants of the most recent Neolithic populations.
The data shows that the ancestors of today's North Africans were a group of populations which already lived in the region around thirteen thousand years ago. Furthermore, this local North African genetic component is very different from the one found in the populations in the south of the Sahara, which shows that the ancestors of today's North Africans were members of a subgroup of humanity who left Africa to conquer the rest of the world and who subsequently returned to the north of the continent to settle in the region.
As well as this local component, North African populations were also observed to share genetic markers with all the neighbouring regions, as a result of more recent migrations, although these appear in different proportions.
There is an influence from the Middle East, which becomes less marked as the distance from the Arabian Peninsula increases, similar proportions of European influence in all North African populations, and, in some populations, there are even individuals who present a large proportion of influence from the South of the Sahara in their genome.
Admixture analysis.
Recent genetic analysis of North African populations have found that, despite the complex admixture genetic background, there is an autochthonous genomic component which is likely derived from “back-to-Africa” gene flow older than 12,000 years ago (ya) (i.e., prior to the Neolithic migrations). This local population substratum seems to represent a genetic discontinuity with the earliest modern human settlers of North Africa (those with the Aterian industry) given the estimated ancestry is younger than 40,000 years ago. North Morocco, Libya and Egypt carry high proportions of European and Near Eastern ancestral components, whereas Tunisian Berbers and Saharawi are those populations with highest autochthonous North African component.
Genetic influence.
Y-chromosome DNA.
The general parent Y-chromosome Haplogroup E1b1b (formerly known as E3b), which might have originated in the Horn of Africa or the near east is by far the most common clade in North and Northeast Africa and found in select populations in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and South Eastern Europe. E1b1b reaches in Europe Greece and the Balkan region but, is not as high there as it is among African populations.[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/littlednaproject/Y-MAP.GIF&date=2009-10-26+01:52:16].
Outside of North and Northeast Africa, E1b1b's two most prevalent clades are E1b1b1a (E-M78, formerly E3b1a) and E1b1b1b (E-M81, formerly E3b1b).
E1b1b1a is the most common subclade of E1b1b and is present predominantly in North East Africa. It was originally thought to have been a marker of Neolithic migrations (perhaps coinciding with the introduction of Agriculture into Europe) from Anatolia to Europe, via the Balkans, where it enjoys the high frequency. However, Cruciani's latest study suggests that it actually arrived into the Balkans from Western Asia during the Palaeolithic, and then spread throughout Europe much later (c. 5300 years ago) due to a population expansion from Egypt. E1b1a is also found at low frequencies in this area.
A study from Semino (published 2004) showed that Y-chromosome haplotype E1b1b1b (E-M81), is specific to North African populations and almost absent in Europe except the Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Sicily. Another 2004 study showed that E1b1b1b is found present, albeit at low levels throughout Southern Europe (ranging from 1.5 percent in Northern Italians, 2.2 percent in Central Italians, 1.6 percent in southern Spaniards, 3.5 percent in the French, 4 percent in the Northern Portuguese, 12.2 percent in the southern Portuguese and 41.2 percent in the genetic isolate of the Pasiegos from Cantabria).
The findings of this latter study contradict a more thorough analysis Y-chromosome analysis of the Iberian peninsula according to which haplogroup E1b1b1b surpasses frequencies of 10 percent in Southern Spain. The study points only to a very limited influence from northern Africa and the Middle East both in historic and prehistoric times. The absence of microsatellite variation suggests a very recent arrival from North Africa consistent with historical exchanges across the Mediterranean during the period of Islamic expansion, namely of Berber populations. A study restricted to Portugal, concerning Y-chromosome lineages, revealed that "The mtDNA and Y data indicate that the Berber presence in that region dates prior to the Moorish expansion in 711 AD. ... Our data indicate that male Berbers, unlike sub-Saharan immigrants, constituted a long-lasting and continuous community in the country".
Haplotype V(p49/TaqI), a characteristic North African haplotype, may be also found in the Iberian peninsula, and a decreasing North-South cline of frequency clearly establishes a gene flow from North Africa towards Iberia which is also consistent with Moorish presence in the peninsula. This North-South cline of frequency of haplotype V is to be observed throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from frequencies of close to 30 percent in southern Portugal to around 10 percent in southern France. Similarly, the highest frequency in Italy is to be found in the southern island of Sicily (28 percent).
A wide-ranging study (published 2007) using 6,501 unrelated Y-chromosome samples from 81 populations found that: "Considering both these E-M78 sub-haplogroups (E-V12, E-V22, E-V65) and the E-M81 haplogroup, the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia (barring Pasiegos), continental Italy and Sicily can be estimated as 5.6 percent, 3.6 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively."
A very recent study about Sicily by Gaetano "et al." 2008 found that "The Hg E3b1b-M81, widely diffused in northwestern African populations, is estimated to contribute to the Sicilian gene pool at a rate of 6 percent." .
According to the most recent and thorough study about Iberia by Adams et al. 2008 that analysed 1,140 unrelated Y-chromosome samples in Iberia, a much more important contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia was found : "mean North African admixture is 10.6 percent, with wide geographical variation, ranging from zero in Gascony to 21.7 percent in Northwest Castile".
Mitochondrial DNA.
Genetic studies on Iberian populations also show that North African mitochondrial DNA sequences (haplogroup U6) and sub-Saharan sequences (Haplogroup L), although present at only low levels, are still at much higher levels than those generally observed elsewhere in Europe. Haplogroup U6 have also been detected in Sicily and South Italy at very low levels. It happens also to be a characteristic genetic marker of the Saami populations of Northern Scandinavia.
It is difficult to ascertain that U6's presence is the consequence of Islam's expansion into Europe during the Middle Ages, particularly because it is more frequent in the north of the Iberian Peninsula rather than in the south. In smaller numbers it is also attested too in the British Isles, again in its northern and western borders. It may be a trace of a prehistoric neolithic/megalithic expansion along the Atlantic coasts from North Africa, perhaps in conjunction with seaborne trade, although an alternative explanation would attribute this distribution to African auxiliaries stationed in Northern Britain during the Roman period. One subclade of U6 is particularly common among Canarian Spaniards as a result of native Guanche (proto-Berber) ancestry.
Genetic influences on Latin America.
As a consequence of Spanish and Portuguese colonization of Latin America, E-M81 is also found throughout Latin America and among Hispanic men in USA.

Lady Hewley Trust

The Lady Hewley Trust, now a charity, began as a significant benefaction to support Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Baptist ministers, at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The trust was later at the centre of a 12-year legal suit in the nineteenth century, noted in Unitarian history, and turning on the current beliefs of ministers who were supported by its funds. While the legal judgement went against the Unitarians, the introduction of the Dissenters' Chapels Act (1844), which followed on the case, improved their position.
Lady Sarah Hewley.
Lady Sarah Hewley (1627–1710) was the only daughter and heiress of Robert Wolrych (died 11 December 1661), bencher of Gray's Inn. Her mother, whose maiden name was Mott, had a fortune from her first husband, whose name was Tichborne. Sarah Wolrych married John Hewley (1619-1697), son of John Hewley of Wistow, near Selby. As his widow, Sarah spent large sums in works of charity.
In 1700 she built and endowed an almshouse at York for ten poor women of her own religious views. In 1705 she contributed to charity schools founded at York by Archbishop John Sharp. She died on 23 August 1710, and was buried with her husband. Portraits of Sir John Hewley and his wife are preserved in the vestry of St. Saviourgate Chapel. Their two children, Wolrych and John, died in infancy.
The Trust.
On 13 January 1704–5 Lady Sarah Hewley conveyed to trustees a landed estate, of which the income was, after her death, to be devoted to benevolent objects, including the support of ‘poor and godly preachers for the time being of Christ's holy gospel.’ The benefactions were increased by a further deed (26 April 1707) and by her will (9 July 1707, codicil 21 August 1710). The will was contested without result. Though the trustees were all Presbyterian, grants were made to ministers of the ‘three denominations;’ in other words Congregationalists and Baptists were included.
Unitarian influence.
By the end of the eighteenth century all the trustees and a majority of the Presbyterian recipients were Unitarian. Independents from Manchester objected to this controlling influence, and they brought a lawsuit concerned with the enforcement of the terms of Lady Hewley's will in 1830; one of the topics in contention was the funding of Manchester Academy. The initial legal ruling sustained the view that a Trinitarian commitment was necessary, from those with benefits from the endowments. This judgement was then twice appealed, but was upheld by the Lord Chancellor in 1836; and again by the House of Lords in 1842.
The outcome was that by a judgment of the House of Lords (5 August 1842) three Congregationalists, three orthodox Presbyterians, and one Baptist were appointed trustees. The income of the trust was then £2,830.
Dissenters' Chapels Act (1844).
As a direct consequence of the legal ruling, a group including Edwin Wilkins Field pressed for legislation. The immediate purpose was to have a retrospective element attached to the date (1813) on which Unitarianism obtained legal tolerance as a belief. (See Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813.) This aim was achieved through Parliament, rather than the courts, with the Dissenters’ Chapels Act (1844). The government supported legislation, which did not reverse the original decision, in order to head off a predicted rush of litigation in hundreds of cases affected by the precedent. A figure of 25 years was established, after which the right of possession of a chapel could not be challenged on doctrinal grounds. Baron Cottenham added a clause to protect two chapels in Dublin over which litigation was already active. Despite extensive opposition from religious groups the bill passed.

Destination Murder

Destination Murder is a 1950 American crime film noir directed by Edward L. Cahn. The drama features Joyce MacKenzie, Stanley Clements and Hurd Hatfield.
Plot.
A woman sets out to find her father's killer, becomes involved with racketeers and murder.
Reception.
Critical response.
Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, "A snappy B-film crime thriller from RKO that is only enjoyable because the story is so quirky. Unfortunately, it is burdened with a convoluted plot and an undeveloped character study. Edward L. Cahn plays it safe in his direction, as he hints of a homosexual relationship between the two main criminals but fails to pursue that avenue of thought. There are also many scenes and situations that seem hokey and hardly credible, as the action not only looks fake but the actors seem to have no energy to even fake the scenes with some enthusiasm."
Critic Hans J. Wollstein panned the film, writing, "In "Destination Murder", former starlet Myrna Dell plays one of those hard-bitten, blonde schemers that no true film noir could be without. Unfortunately, both she and Stanley Clements, the only other interesting character in the film, are killed off fairly early on in the game. The result is a rather unsatisfying crime thriller where the 'Why?' is more of a mystery than the 'Who?'"

Ossie Newton-Thompson

John Oswald "Ossie" Newton-Thompson (2 December 1920 – 3 April 1974) was a South African sportsman and politician. He played international rugby union for England and was also a first-class cricketer. From 1961 until his death in 1974, Newton-Thompson was a member of South African parliament.
Early life and education.
Newton-Thompson was born in London to lawyer Cyril Newton-Thompson and his wife Joyce, who later became the first female mayor of Cape Town. He however grew up in South Africa, where he attended Diocesan College and then the University of Cape Town. In 1940 he returned to England after receiving a Rhodes Scholarship for Trinity College, Oxford. His brother was Christopher Newton Thompson.
World War II.
His studies at Oxford were interrupted by World War II, where he served with the South African Air Force. He was awarded a DFC after fighting with a Spitfire Squadron in Italy.
Sport at Oxford University.
In 1946, Newton-Thompson appeared in seven first-class matches for the Oxford University Cricket Club as a right handed middle order batsman. He could only score 171 runs from 14 innings and went wicket-less from his 24 overs of right-arm slow bowling.
He also played rugby union for Oxford University as a scrum-half and was the team's captain in 1946.
International rugby.
England selected Newton-Thompson in two Tests during their 1947 Five Nations Championship campaign, which saw them share the title with Wales. He was first capped in England's win over Scotland at Twickenham and made his other appearance in their defeat of France at the same venue.
Return to South Africa.
Newton-Thompson played two further first-class cricket matches after returning to South Africa. He scored 78 in his debut innings for Western Province against the Marylebone Cricket Club in Cape Town, his only half century at that level. Four of the MCC's bowlers were Test cricketers, including a young Alec Bedser, who dismissed him in both innings. He was then picked in a Cape Province representative team which played the MCC a week later but he couldn't repeat his previous effort and scored 0 and 28.
A lawyer, he ran successfully in 1961 for a seat in South African parliament, as the United Party candidate for Pinelands.
Death.
He re-contested his seat in the 1974 general election and was campaigning in South-West Africa when he was killed in an air crash.

<doc id="31034361" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31034361" title="History of the Jews in Cologne">
History of the Jews in Cologne

The history of the Jews in Cologne is documented from the year 321 AD, almost as long as the history of Cologne. Over its history, the Jewish community of Cologne has suffered persecutions, many expulsions, massacres and destruction. The community numbered about 19,500 people before its dispersal, murders and destruction in the 1930s by the Nazis before and during World War II. The community has re-established itself and now numbers about 4,500 members. Because of its historical continuity, today’s Jewish synagogue calls itself the "oldest Jewish congregation north of the Alps".
The Roman Age.
Cologne was founded and established in the 1st century AD, as the Roman "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium" in Ubii territory. It was the capital of the Roman province of "Germania Inferior" and the headquarters of the military in the region. Cologne was an important city in Roman times. H. Nissen assumes a much greater population for Roman Cologne than it was in the Middle Ages, when he estimates it was between 30,000–40,000. It is reasonable to assume that the spread of Christianity in any Roman province was preceded and accompanied by the existence there of Jews. The presence of Christians in Cologne in the 2nd century would therefor argue for the settlement of Jews in the city at that early date.
Judaism was recognized as a "religio licita" (permitted religion), and Jews were exempt from the offering to the Emperor and to the offerings to the Roman state gods. However, Jews were refused access to public offices because these were the basic requirements for access to a public office. For the appointment to a town office a person was required to own land and to have a certain reputation. In Late Antiquity, the Roman upper class increasingly refused to participate in these expensive offices, and the Roman administration went into crisis and the emperor had to look for alternatives. It became necessary for the Cologne Council to use a decree of Emperor Constantine the Great of 321, which permitted Jews to be appointed to the "curia". This is the first evidence of the existence of a Jewish community in the town of Cologne. The emperor's decree was passed down in the "Codex Theodosianus" (439), which indicates the existence of a firmly established Jewish community in Cologne in 321 and 331. A partial translation of the "Codex" reads:
"We allow all town councils to appoint through general law, Jewish people in the Curia. To give them a certain compensation for the previous rules, we let that always two or three of them enjoy the privilege not to be taken to any office."
Archaeological finds indicate the presence of Orientals at about that period, and among them there were Syrians, as is proved by an Aramaic inscription dug up in 1930. In another document, from 341, it is recorded that the synagogue was provided with the emperor’s privilege. These decrees of Constantine remained for some centuries the only accounts of the existence of a Jewish community in Cologne.
Middle Ages.
Under the Frankish, Saxon and Salian kings.
The region was occupied by the Franks in 462, which converted to Christianity by the end of the century. During the Middle Ages, Cologne flourished as one of the most important trade routes between east and west Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and renaissance times. The first documentary reference to the Jews in Cologne in the Middle Ages was to the time of Archbishop Heribert of Cologne (999-1021), the wise friend of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. Winheim and Gelenius, basing themselves on the Annual Chronicles of Cologne during the 14th and 15th centuries, report that in 1426 the synagogue was turned into a church. They then remark that this synagogue had been in existence 414 years. That would place its origin in the time of Heribert. The Jewish Quarter close to Hohe Straße is mentioned for the first time during the episcopate of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne (1056–1075) and a report has come down about the Jews joining in lament over the archbishop’s death.
The number of Jews in the community during the last quarter of the 11th century was not less than 600. The markets of Cologne had attracted many Jewish visitors who had partly stayed. Italian Jews are mentioned in the stories about the Crusaders in Cologne. The fact that the Jewish community was important is proved further by the statement in these Hebrew reports that out of Cologne there went forth "our brethren scattered over the earth support for their life and correct words of judgment". It means that the community was the center of Jewish life for all the communities of the area.
Crusades.
During the Middle Ages, the Jewish community had been settled in a quarter near the "Rathaus". Still now the name "Judengasse" testifies its existence. During the First Crusade in 1096 there were several pogroms. Although the Crusade started from France, assaults happened through the Holy Roman Empire. On 27 May 1096 hundreds of Jews were killed in Mainz in the Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade. The palace of the archbishop of Mainz, Ruthard, where the Jews had taken refuge, was stormed by the Crusaders after little resistance. Ruthard was accused of appropriating the property of murdered Jews. A similar thing happened in July of the same year in Cologne. The Jews were forcibly baptized. The permission of Emperor Henry IV to let the Jews who had been forcibly baptized go back to their faith was not ratified by Antipope Clement III. From those times, small and large assaults were repeated not only in the Rhineland.
In the 12th and 13th century the antisemitic attitude of the town citizens became stronger. In 1146 other Jewish people were killed near Königswinter by a mob of furious Christians, just after the beginning of the Second Crusade. Also in Andernach, Altenahr, Bonn and Lechenich Jews were killed and their houses plundered. These events are presumably to be associated with a wave of persecutions in 1287/88. Violent assaults on Jews of Cologne are not reported in this period. Following the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, all Jews were obliged to display on their clothing a clear sign they were not Christians.
Medieval Pogroms in Cologne.
In the years before the pogrom of August 1349 the atmosphere in the Cologne area towards the Jewish population was not friendly at all. In 1300, a wall was built around the Jewish Quarter, presumably by the Jewish Community itself. 
Pope John XXII started in 1317 a rigorous campaign against the Jews and had publicly declared that usurious interest (which meant any interest) should not be paid to Jews. In 1320, some inhabitants of Cologne tried to avoid the obligation to pay their debts to Jews by appealing to the legislation of the church. The Cologne Council thought it was necessary to come first towards this refusal to repay debts sanctioned by the Church and took action in 1321 against interest due under penalty. In 1327, the council reiterated this ordinance and appealed directly against a papal decree that was directed specifically against Salomon of Basel. The same council referred in 1334 to the same letter of the pope and appealed to Archbishop Walram von Jülich for protection from a Jewish banker named Meyer of Siegburg who demanded payment of money from it. The action finished with the withdrawal of all city debts and the condemnation of Meyer to death. The councilmen were in debt to Meyer, and the archbishop kept the confiscated property of the condemned person. In addition, the archbishop had also debts with Meyer and could cancel them in the same way.
Altogether the Jews of Cologne between 1096 and 1349 appeared indeed to have been relatively safe regarding life and physical condition as "fellow citizens (Mitbürger)". However, there are enough references that offences have been taken against them. So it is famous the so-called Jewish sow on a wooden seat of the Cologne Cathedral choir, that was made presumably around 1320.
Council decisions document the worsening climate between Christians and Jews. Decisions between 1252 and 1320 address legal status, protection and taxation of the Cologne Jews. The pogrom wave affected also other towns of the Empire. There is a letter of the Cologne Council to the council of Strasbourg where the Cologne Council expresses concern about an incident in Strasbourg and warns insistently about an escalation. The Jews and their possessions were protected by letters of protection or consolation, this had to be considered. In addition there was the accusation that the Jews had poisoned the springs and so caused the pestilence, unproved in any single case. In the same letter the Cologne Council make clear that they will decidedly protect Cologne Jews. In the years towards 1320 we know by sure of hostility of the Cologne clergy against the Jews for religious reasons, that gets particularly excited by the privileges of the Cologne Jews. The reason for this can be seen in the change of the "Schutzjude". The Cologne clergy took no more profit for itself from the loan transactions of the Jews. Increasingly the town council participated in the business, and this provoked additional frictions between the Archbishop and the Council.
The latter played an important role in the persecution of the Cologne Jews in 1349. From 1266 the Cologne Jews had the exclusive privilege to lend money. The Archbishop Engelbert II von Falkenburg had the "Judenprivileg" carved in stone on the outside of the Dom treasury room. In the struggle for power, the Cologne Jews could also be used to a certain extent as pressure medium. The protectors of the Cologne Jews, the Archbishop and the King, could sell the Schutzjude. There was a legal fight between the clergy, the king and the Cologne Council, so the council could take from the others a profitable source of revenue if he got rid of the Jews. Additionally some debts could be cancelled.
In 1340 a terrible pestilence arrived in Europe. The Black Death had not reached Cologne until December 1349, also the first month after the hard August pogrom. However news about its devastating impact arrived on the Rhine from the south considerably earlier. Possibly the news were made worse from the population and provoked an eschatological agitation. In this overall situation fell the devastating pogrom of 23/24 August 1349 in Cologne.
Jews were also held responsible for the Black Death. In the night of Saint Bartholemy (23/24 August) in 1349 a pogrom took place that was called the "Slaughter of the Jews" in the history of the town. On that night an enraged mob entered the Jewish quarter and killed most of the inhabitants.
In 1424, Jews were banned from the town "for eternity". This ban on Jewish settlement in Cologne was withdrawn at the end of the 18th century. A new Jewish community came into existence under the French administration. At the beginning of the Modern Age the area of the Jewish quarter was rebuilt and the previous inhabitants forgotten.
After the destruction of the community during Second World War, the Medieval foundations were discovered, among them a synagogue and the monumental Cologne "mikveh" (ritual bath). The archeological survey was conducted after the war by Otto Doppelfeld from 1953 to 1956. On the basis of the awareness of history the area has not been reconstructed after the war and has remained as a square in front of the historical Rathaus. Today, the Jewish quarter is part of the "archeological zone of Cologne".
Preparation of the pogrom.
Jewish persecution at the time of the Black Death was the fiercest of the Middle Ages and had its origin in southwest Europe. Echoes can be found certainly in the German Empire.
The pogrom wave hit many towns even before the pestilence reached them. Very common were the accusations upraised for poisoning of springs. The pogroms spread like snowballs. It is unlikely that they were spontaneous and they originated from low population. Rather they show signs of a certain plan, that in its imprint shows the involvement of the leading social levels, or at least part of them. So the already mentioned events in Strassbourg, that the Cologne Council watched closely, suggest a clear plan. They previously formed an alliance with all that could have an advantage from the killing or expulsion of the Jews, to be able to make a point towards their protectors. Especially King Charles IV and the Habsburgher reeves and settled Jews in their domains. The council of Straßburg invoked the public peace and called on all the citizens to kill the Jews in their territory. So this pogrom was finally aimed against the Habsburgs and exploited the hysteria of the population simply to reach its goals of political power.
The archbishop of Cologne, Walram von Jülich, who had left the city at the end of June 1349 to go to France, died in Paris after a short time. King Charles IV had stayed in Cologne until 19 June and had left with his entourage. He had succeeded to take Cologne to his side giving benefits in crown disputes. Probably the negotiations were not successful for all groups of interests. The extermination of the Jewish community could have the aim to weaken Charles IV and the clergy. Already before the transition of the archbishop had led to persecution. This happened after the Battle of Worringen on 8 June 1288 when the defeated Cologne archbishop was imprisoned. For days afterwards a persecution of Jews happened in the surroundings of Cologne. In August 1349 not only the seat of the Cologne archbishop was vacant but also Charles IV was not nearby to take action. So came the excesses that peaked on 24 August with the so-called "Cologne night of Bartholomew". On 23–24 August the somewhat secure for Jewish Cologne came to death. After violent assaults in the surroundings the Jews were killed also in Cologne.
Night of Bartholomew and its consequences.
The actual outcome of the pogrom is not well known. In the course of the night of Bartholomew in 1349 the Jewish quarter near the Rathaus was attacked, after which killing, plundering of Jewish properties and fire followed. Fugitives were pursued and killed. The Council didn’t intervene. Many sources report about the fire even if they are partly contradictory. Some report that the Jews themselves put fire to their houses not to fall into the hands of the looters. Another version is that the Jews burned themselves in their synagogue, which is rather improbable. Archeological excavations in the area of the medieval Jewish quarter have suggested that the synagogue itself was standing without damage after the night, but that it was plundered later. In the escape a family buried its belongings and merchandise. The treasury of coins was discovered in 1954 excavations and is exhibited in the "Kölnisches Stadtmuseum".
The account of the chronicler Gilles Li Muisis, in which he tells of a regular battle against more than 25,000 Jews and credits the victory of the Cologne people to a stratagem of a butcher is considered not reliable. The account of Gilles Li Muisis coined the term "Judenschlacht" (battle of the Jews) for the event of that night. Equally obscure is the involvement of Flagellant who, in accordance to sources, should have been in Cologne in 1349. The Council of Cologne and the new archbishop Wilhelm von Gennep condemned the pogrom with all their acrimony. The names of the real wire pullers and of the violent invaders of the Jewish quarter remained unknown. It can only be declared that it was then tried to leave the culprits unknown. A communication of the Cologne Council says that it was an out-of-town mob followed by a few have-not from Cologne. A few expelled survivors from the town looked for refuge across the Rhine. Around ten years after the 1349 pogrom wave Jewish settlements are documented in Andernach and Siegburg.
They came back in a documented way only in 1369, although already Archbishop Boemund II von Saarbrücken during his charge from 1354 to 1361 tried to force the return of the Jews. But first under Engelbert III von der Mark and particularly under his coadjutor Kuno von Falkenstein the strained relation between the archbishop and the municipality improved so much that the protection of Jews looked again reasonably assured. In 1372, a small Jewish community in Cologne is again proven.
Under the request of Archbishop Friedrich they were admitted to the town and they obtained a temporary protection privilege for 10 years. To this the Council attached however some conditions. For the moving-in there was a tax between 50 and 500 Gulden and a new sum specifiable every year to be paid as a general contribution. After other extensions of the right of residence the Council proclaimed in 1404 a tightened "Judenordnung". It was ordered to the Jews to be recognized through a pointed Jewish hat and they were banned from any kind of luxury. In 1423 the Cologne Council decided not to extend the temporary right of residence for the Jews which expired on October 1424. However it is notable that one could immediately re-establish a full community and not first, as it was done by many other large towns, only a few Jews at a time.
Emigration.
Following the medieval pogroms and expulsion of 1424, many Jews of Cologne emigrated to central or northern European countries like Poland and Lithuania. The offspring of these emigrants returned to Cologne at the beginning of the 19th century and lived mainly in the area of Thieboldsgasse on the southeast side of Neumarkt. Only a few Jews remained near Cologne and settled predominantly on the eastern bank of the Rhine (Deutz, Mühlheim, Zündorf). Later new communities developed, that got larger with the years. The first community in Deutz lived in the area of nowadays "Mindener Straße". There, Jews felt themselves safe under the protection of archbishop Dietrich von Moers (1414–1463).
Cultural life in Middle Ages.
In Cologne there was one of the largest Jewish library of Middle Ages. After the massacre of the Jews in York, England in 1190, a number of Hebrew books from there were brought to and sold in Cologne. There are a number of remarkable manuscripts and illuminations prepared by and for Jews of Cologne during the 12th to the 15th centuries and now kept in various libraries and museums throughout the world.
Distinguished Cologne Jews.
According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Cologne was a center of Jewish learning, and the "wise of Cologne" are frequently mentioned in rabbinical literature. A characteristic of the Talmudic authorities of that city was their liberality. Many liturgical poems still in the Ashkenazic ritual were composed by poets of Cologne.
Here are the names of many rabbis and scholars of the 11th and 12th centuries: the legendary Amram, traditional founder of the Talmudic school in the 10th century; R. Jacob ben Yaḳḳar, disciple of Gerson Meor ha-Golah (1050); the liturgist Eliakim ben Joseph; Eliezer ben Nathan (1070–1152), the chronicler of the First Crusade; the poet Eliezer ben Simson, who, together with the last named, took part in the famous assembly of French and German rabbis about the mid-12th century; the Tosafist Samuel ben Natronai and his son Mordecai; the liturgist Joel ben Isaac ha-Levi (d. 1200); Uri ben Eliakim (mid-12th century); R. Eliakim ben Judah; Ephraim ben Jacob of Bonn (b. 1132), the chronicler of the Second Crusade. The last lost at Cologne, in 1171, his son Eliakim, a promising youth, who was murdered in the street. His tombstone is still to be seen in the cemetery of Cologne.
Among the rabbis and scholars of the 13th century were: Eliezer ben Joel ha-Levi; Uri ben Joel ha-Levi; Jehiel ben Uri, father of R. Asher; Isaac ben Simson (martyred in 1266); Isaac ben Abraham, brother of the Tosafist Simson ben Abraham of Sens (martyred in 1266 at Sinzig); R. Isaiah ben Nehemiah (also martyred in 1266 at Sinzig); the liturgist Eliezer ben Ḥayyim; Ḥayyim ben Jehiel (d. 1314) and Asher ben Jehiel (b. c. 1250; d. 1327); Yaḳḳar ben Samuel ha-Levi; Reuben ben Hezekiah of Boppard; Abraham ben Samuel; Judah ben Meïr; Samuel ben Joseph; Ḥayyim ben Shaltiel; Nathan ben Joel ha-Levi; Jacob Azriel ben Asher ha-Levi; Meïr ben Moses; Eliezer ben Judah ha-Kohen, most of whom are known as commentators on the Bible.
The rabbis and scholars of the 14th century include: Samuel ben Menahem, Talmudist and liturgist; Jedidiah ben Israel, disciple of Meïr of Rothenburg; and Mordecai ben Samuel. These three are called in the municipal sources "Gottschalk," "Moyter," and "Süsskind." The rabbi who officiated at the time of the banishment was Jekuthiel ben Moses Möln ha-Levi.
In Middle Ages there were in Cologne the following buildings, synagogues, mikvehs, schools, hospices and cemeteries:
Judenbüchel.
In 1174 a document of Saint Engelbert, at the time provost of the monastery of Saint Severin in Cologne, mentions that from 38 years Knight Ortliv had given back five jugerum of land that he had received from the monastery as a fief near the Jews cemetery, and the land had been let to the Jews against a yearly payment of four denarii and Ortliv couldn’t have any claim on it.
In 1266 Archbishop Engelbert II von Falkenburg assured the lawful management and undisturbed usage of their cemetery on Bonner Strasse. It was located outside the walls of Cologne towards the south near Severinstores, called Judenbüchel or "Toten Juden". This name remained to the area also after the removal of the cemetery until the construction of the supermarket in this place.
The cemetery measured 29,000 square meters. In 1096 Salomon ben Simeon mentions the tombstones of the Jews buried there. In 1146 Rabbi Simeon of Treves was buried in the cemetery by the leaders of the Cologne Jewish community. The earliest tombstone still in existence dates from the year 1152. After 1349 the tombstones were considered owner-less, some of them were torn out of their places and used by Archbishop William de Gunnep for the construction of the fortress of Lechenig or in Huelchrath. After 1372 the Jews of Cologne again were granted the use of the cemetery and it was used until 1693 mainly by the Jews of Deutz.
Tombstones of 1323.
By excavations of the area of the Cologne Rathaus in 1953 two fully conserved tombstones were found on the northwest corner of the building in a large bomb crater. They probably came from the Jewish cemetery of Judenbüchel and were used as building material. The inscription of the tombstone of Rachel said:
Modern times.
After the expulsion.
In 1634, there were 17 Jews in Deutz, in 1659 there were 24 houses inhabited by Jews and in 1764 the community consisted of 19 people. Towards the end of the 18th century the community still consisted of 19 people.
The community was located in a small Jewish "quarter" in the area of Mindener and Hallenstraße. A synagogue, first mentioned in 1426, was damaged by the immense ice drift of the Rhine in 1784. The "mikveh" associated with the synagogue is probably still now exists under the embankment of the Brückenrampe (Deutzer Bridge). This first synagogue was then replaced by a new small building on the west end of "Freiheit", the today’s street "Deutzer Freiheit" (1786–1914).
In those times, the Jews of the Deutz community lived like all the others of the Electorate of Cologne under the legal and society conditions, that were provided by the state from the end of the 16th century through a so-called "Judenordnung". The last issue of this laws for the Jews was the Order of 1700 by Kurfürst (elector of the Holy Roman Empire) Joseph Clemens. They were kept until new legislation came also in Deutz, with the adoption of the Napoleonic code.
During the construction of the Deutzer Hängebrücke in 1913/14, the synagogue was abandoned and demolished. In December 1913, during works to remove the "Schiffsbrückenstraßenbahnlinie" in Deutz on the "Freiheitsstraße", a mikveh was found under the old synagogue. The bath had a link to the water of the Rhine.
Deutz Cemetery.
In contrast to the building evidence in Innenstadt, the history of the Jewish communities outside the city center is revealed above all through the remains of the Jewish cemeteries. There are right-Rhenish Jewish cemetery in Mülheim, "Am Springborn", in Zündorf between "Hasenkaul" and the "Gartenweg", and one in Deutz im "Judenkirchhofsweg". The latter was given to the Jews of Deutz by Archbishop Joseph Clemens of Bavaria in 1695 as a rented land. The first burials took place in 1699. When in 1798 the Jews were again permitted to settle within the old city walls of Cologne, the cemetery was also used by this community until 1918.
Comeback.
Until the French annexion of Cologne in 1794, following the French Revolution, no Jew was permitted to settle in Cologne. The Napoleonic Code included equality before the law, rights of individual freedom and the separation of church and state. The Government Commissioner Rudler, in his proclamation of June 21, 1798 to the inhabitants of the conquered territory announced: 
A few months earlier, Joseph Isaac of Mühlheim on the Rhine had sought civic rights from the Magistracy of Cologne. Since he presented favorable evidence of his previous conduct and also proved that he would not become a burden to the city because of poverty, permission was granted to him on March 16, 1798 to settle in Cologne. The rest of his requests for civic rights were refused because French regulations had not yet come into force. He was followed by Samuel Benjamin Cohen of Bonn, son of the Chief Rabbi Simha Brunem. At the same time, the 17-years old Salomon Oppenheim, Jr. moved his businesses from Bonn to Cologne. He belonged to the families who built the first Cologne community of Modern Times. Oppenheim, Jr. traded with cotton, linen, oil, wine and tobacco but his main activity was banking. Already in 1810 his bank was the second largest in Cologne after "Abraham Schaffhausen". Within the new Cologne Jewish community, Oppenheim, Jr. took an outstanding position in the social and political life. He was in charge of the community school but he was also the deputy of the Cologne community, who sent him to the congress of Jewish Notables in Paris in 1806–1807.
A modest hall of prayer was built inside the court of the former Monastery of St. Clarissa in Glockengasse. The land was bought by Benjamin Samuel Cohen, one of the Jewish communal leaders in the early 1800s, taking advantage of a property sale by the French tax-office. Even if in those times a row of Jewish business people experienced an economic and social rise—Oppenheim Jr. was elected unanimously to be a member of the Chamber of Commerce and had for the first time as a Jew a public office—their legal status was unsecure.
The Prussian Jews Edict of March 11, 1912 didn't apply everywhere. It lasted until the Prussian Jewish Law of 1847 and finally until 1848, with the adoption of the constitutional charter for the Prussian State, the special status of the Jews was definitely abolished and a complete equality of rights with all other citizens was attained. During the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states in 1848/49 there were strong anti-Jewish excesses in Eastern and South-eastern German regions and towns like Berlin, Prag and Vienna—but also Cologne.
Due to the growth of the community and the disrepair of the prayer hall in the former Monastery of St. Clarissa, the Oppenheim family donated a new synagogue building at Glockengasse 7. The number of the members of the community was now about of 1,000 adults. While in Medieval times the "quarter" had been built close to the synagogue in Cologne "Judengasse", by now the Jews lived in a decentralized area among the rest of the population. Many lived in the new periphery quarters near the city walls.
Due to further growth of the Jewish population, more new constructions followed the one in Glockengasse. The orthodox synagogue in St. Apern Straße was dedicated on January 16, 1884; the liberal synagogue in Roonstraße was dedicated on March 22, 1899.
In the face of historical experiences in Europe, the Jews started initiatives to create their own state. The head office of the Zionist Organization for Germany was based in Richmodstraße near Neumarkt square, Cologne, and was founded by lawyer Max Bodenheimer together with merchant David Wolffsohn. Bodeheimer was president until 1910 and worked for Zionism with Theodor Herzl. The "Kölner Thesen" developed under Bodenheimer for Zionism were — with few adjustments — adopted as the "Basel Program" by the first Zionist Congress. The goal of the organization was to obtain the foundation of a distinct state of Israel in Palestine for all the Jews of the world.
The conservative synagogue in Glockengasse.
After the constant growth of the community the hall of prayer at Glockengasse was overloaded. A donation of the Cologne banker Abraham Oppenheim of around 600,000 "thalers" allowed the construction of a new synagogue. The project was won by Ernst Friedrich Zwirner, leading architect of the Cathedral of Cologne, who designed a building in Moorish style. The new synagoge was inaugurated after four years of construction in August 1861. The inner and outside design was to remind the bloom of Jewish culture during 11th-century Moorish Spain. The new synagogue had a façade of light sandstone with red horizontal stripes as well as oriental minaret and a cupola covered with copper plates. The ornaments in the inside were inspired by the Alhambra of Granada. The new synagogue, which was valued positively by Cologne people, had seats for 226 men and 140 women.
While set on fire in November 1938, the rolls of the Torah of 1902 could be saved, thanks to the Cologne priest Gustav Meinertz. After the war they were placed in a glass cabinet in Roonstrasse Synagogue. After a restoration, carried out in Jerusalem in 2007, they are now used again in the liturgies in Roonstrasse Synagogue, rebuilt after the war.
The orthodox synagogue in St. Apern-Straße.
The St. Aper Straße Synagogue already existed during the middle of 18th century. It was located in a mixed-use area, appreciated by affluent citizens. There were many exquisite antique shops, in which mostly Jewish owners sold expensive furniture and jewels. In 1884, these inhabitants built a synagogue of the orthodox community "Adass Jeschurun". The last rabbi was Isidor Caro who died in Theresienstadt concentration camp.
In the associated Jawne School, a Jewish school, there were courses from 1919 to 1941. It was the first and only Jewish gymnasium in the Rhineland.
The liberal synagogue in Roonstraße.
By the end of 1899, the Jewish community in Cologne had grown to 9,745 members. Already in 1893, the community had bought a piece of land on Roonstraße — opposite the Königsplatz. In 1894, the Representative Assembly of the city voted for a grant of 40,000 marks from the city treasury. It was estimated that the cost of the new building would be about 550,000 marks. To cover this sum a substantial loan was made with the "Prussian Zentralbodenkredit Aktiengesellshaft". The synagogue was finished in 1899 and had place for 763 men and 587 women in the gallery. A historical photo was considered worth to be put in the photo archive of the Israeli Holocaust Memorial Yad Vashem. The structure has been seriously damaged during the war but it was decided to rebuild it. The reopened synagogue was dedicated on September 20, 1959.
The synagogue in Reischplatz in Deutz.
The last synagogue was built in Reischplatz in Deutz. The building was dedicated in 1915 and, after the damages of the last war, was rebuilt in another form and with a new usage, as there was no more Jewish community in Deutz. A commemorative plaque remembers the Deutz community and its last synagogue.
The synagogue in Mülheim.
The first synagogue of the community of Köln-Mülheim was damaged by a Rhine flood in 1784 — as was the one in Deutz. A new synagogue was dedicated in the same place a few years later, designed by the master-builder Wilhelm Hellwig in 1788/1789.
The disposition of the construction began on the street with a school, on which a synagogue was attached with a hip roof on four sides. The building survived the 1938 pogrom but was damaged during the war and demolished in 1956.
Jewish community in Zündorf.
The synagogue in Niederzündorf was at the beginning a prayer room, that had not enough space after the strong growth of the community in the 19th century. In 1882 a new building was completed, and the "Zündorfer Pfarrchronik" wrote:
The land (today Hauptstr. 159) was sold and partly donated to the community by two Jewish business people from there, "Lazarus Meyer" und "Simon Salomon".
The Pfarrchronik also wrote:
Jewish cemetery at Melaten.
It is not clear in which year a Jewish cemetery was created as part of the large cemetery of Melaten. Until 1829, only Catholics could be buried there, while Protestants were buried in the old Geusen cemetery in Weyertal. The Jewish community buried its dead people until 1918 in Deutz and then in Bocklemünd. However, in 1899 also a section of Melaten cemetery was reserved to the Jews. In 1899 there was the first burial. A part of the piece of land bordering a high wall can still be seen from the Melatengürtel street. In 1928, the cemetery was violated for the first time, in 1938 the mortuary chapel was destroyed.
Deckstein cemetery.
Located in Köln-Lindenthal, behind the area of the old Deckstein cemetery, this cemetery was created in 1910 from the community "Adass Jeschurun". The Adass Jeschurun oppose to any concession to Christian rituals. So there is no burial in a coffin or urn. Also flower decorations or wreath are not common. The tombstones of the cemetery are very sober and predominantly engraved with Hebrew letters. Entry is not open to the public. (A permit must be asked to the Synagogengemeinde Köln)
Integration and business community.
The Jewish business community was optimistic for the future. In 1891, the merchant Leonhard Tietz opened a department store on Hohe Straße. The banks of Seligmann and the Oppenheim family flourished. The store of textile wholesale company "Gebrüder Bing und Söhne" opened on the Neumarkt. Exquisite shops of Jewish merchants were situated around the cathedral on Hohe Straße and Schildergasse.
By the middle of the 19th century, Cologne developed into a scientific, economic and cultural centre, and the Jewish community had a strong part in this development. After Jewish citizens had taken their place in the financial and commercial world, and while being respected and recognized most places, they also tried to contribute in the forming of the political opinion. For example, Moses Hess and Karl Marx in 1842 wrote in the newly established "Rheinische Zeitung". They were among the leading contributors to this newspaper, dedicated to "politics, business and trade". In 1863, Hess, in his article "Rome and Jerusalem", tried to present a possibility of a resettlement of Jews in Palestine. His work, however, found little approval, with Jews in Germany, especially in large cities like Cologne, considering Germany as their country of origin and home.
First World War and Weimar Republic.
Just at the beginning of the First World War, the Jewish associations called their members to stand up for Germany. However the existing ressentiment against Jews participating to the war was so strong, especially among officers, that the Ministry of War was compelled as a mediation to arrange a so-called Jewish census. At the end of the war in 1918, Adolf Kober took the place of rabbi of the Cologne community, which was one of the largest in Germany. Kober was one of the co-sponsors of the exhibition of the Jewish history in the "Millennium-Exhibition of the Rhineland", that took place at the Cologne trade fairgrounds in 1925. By 1918 the Jewish cemetery of Bocklemünd was opened, which is still in use today.
Nazism and World War II.
With the takeover of the political power by the Nazis repression against the Jewish citizens of Cologne started again. In spring 1933, 15,000 inhabitants declared on the population census that they were Jewish. There were 6 synagogues and other community and meeting places in Cologne, which were all violated in the Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938 and were completely destroyed after the war, until the reconstruction of the synagogue in Roonstraße.
Antisemitism in Cologne.
Also in Cologne there were Nazi and antisemitic attitudes in the population and society. In fact Cologne politicians like Konrad Adenauer or writers like Heinrich Böll demonstrated a spirit of defiance and sovereignty that "no tyrant, no dictator can feel well in Cologne".
A few Cologne people made an open opposition to Nazism or hid Jews (a known example of this is the Ehrenfeld Group). The agitation against Judaism and Cologne Jews found no contrast, so in the antisemitic pieces of the Hänneschen-Theater or in Cologne Carnival, in which no clear criticism against National Socialism was exhibited. Carnival carriages in the Rosenmontag parade showed antisemitic themes and a carnival song mocked the Jews: ""Metz dä Jüdde es jetz Schluß, Se wandere langsam uss. (...) Mir laachen uns für Freud noch halv kapott. Der Itzig und die Sahra trecke fott"" (translation: ""With the Jews it is finished, they emigrate slowly… We laugh with joy. The Itzig and the Sarah move away"",
Aryanization.
The so-called Aryanization proceeded in two phases. The first between January 1933 and November 1938 was the "voluntary" Aryanization. In the official version it was stated as a voluntary change of property between a Jewish and a non-Jewish contract partner. This willingness was achieved selling "voluntarily" a shop, a practice, a bar, a pharmacy or a company, through a business transaction described in the following: Increasingly business people decorated their shops or their advertising with opportunistic slogans. One saw printed or handwritten writings with a number of words, for example: "German shop", "German goods" or also "Christian shop". Painted stars of David or defamation slogans on the walls or windows of the Jews followed. Announcements were made by the local NSDAP, in which lists of specified companies with the names of the Jewish owners were supplied. 
On April 1, 1933, in the day of the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, members of NS-organizations placed themselves in front of Jewish shops also in Cologne to prevent the entrance to customers. The Jewish merchant Richard Stern, who had fought in the first world war, distributed a leaflet against the boycott and placed himself with ostentation with his Iron Cross near the SA-poster in front of his shop. The repression against Jewish businessmen took such an effect that the population avoided buying in these shops and the owners lost their means of existence. Jewish merchants tried to hold out against the pressure to have a compensation for their property. The newspapers were in succession stacked with announcements about failures and acquisitions of Jewish companies.
The second phase of Aryanization started after November 1938, with the Party acting more openly. Jewish property on companies or buildings were with state laws "arianized by force". They were forced to sell their property under the market value. It stroke by example the company "Deka-Schuh, Leopold Dreyfuß" in Ehrenfeld, the neckties whole sale "Herbert Fröhlich" in the Streitzeuggasse, the butcher and snack bar "Katz-Rosenthal", the fashion boutique "Michel" (later Jacobi) and the clothing house "Bamberger" (later Hansen). Particularly hard were struck the numerous Jewish shops on the Hohe Straße and Schildergasse, there one over three shops were aryanized.
Together with the shops and their names trusted from the Cologne people also their owners were blown away. These measures ended up with persecution and deportation of Cologne Jews.
The day of boycott was also directed against Jewish lawyers and doctors. On 31 March there were violent attacks by the SA and SS against Jewish lawyers in the Justice building on Reichensperger Platz. Judges and lawyers were arrested, partly mistreated, then loaded on garbage trucks and taken around the city.
In October 1935 Jews were excluded from the benefits of the "Winterhelp of the German People", and a "Jewish Winterhelp" was organized as an autonomous organization. It collected money,food, clothing, furniture and fuel and in winter 1937/38 the organisation supported 2,300 indigent people, a fifth of Jewish community.
Ehrenfeld.
Although already in 1925 Cologne was the capital of the NSDAP-Gau of Cologne-Aachen, many didn't realize the growing radicalness of this party. Still in 1927 the synagogue in Körnerstraße was built as the last construction of the Jewish community of Cologne by the architect Robert Stern. It was dedicated to "the glory of God, the truth of faith and the peace of mankind". The synagogue had a small vestibule surrounded with arches. The prayer room had 200 seats for men and 100 for women. The latter were located in a women gallery, as in many other places. The Jewish population in Ehrenfeld reached 2000 people. The synagogue had also a ritual bath, that was discovered through excavations in Körnerstraße.
A plaque in Körnerstraße remembers the destroyed synagogue and its attached religion school: 
"In this place there was the Synagogue of Ehrenfelder, connected to a Religion school for girls and boys, built in 1927 according to the plan of Architect Robert Stern, destroyed in the day after the pogrom of Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938"
At the place of the synagogue there is now an air-raid shelter, built in 1942–43, which has been protected as a historical monument since 1995.
Müngersdorf concentration camp.
After the organized and controlled destruction of lives, properties and establishments in the whole country, the antisemitic policies intensified also in Cologne. Jewish children could not attend any German school. By 1 January 1939 all the Jews were excluded from the economic life and constrained to forced labor. They were expropriated, renters were deprived of rent control.
In total, more than 40% of the Jewish population emigrated before September 1939. In May 1939 the Jewish population was 8,406 with another 2,360 "Mischlinge", persons of mixed Jewish-non-Jewish ancestry. When war came in September 1939, the remainder of Cologne Jewry became subject to an all-night curfew, their special food rations were far below that of the general population, they were officially forbidden to use public transport and, when allied bombing began, to use public air raid shelters.
In May 1941 the Cologne Gestapo started to concentrate all Jewish from Cologne in so-called Jewish houses. From there they were transferred to the barracks in Fort V in Müngersdorf. The ghettoisation was the preparation for the deportation to exterminations camps. In September 1941 the "Police order about the identification of Jews" obliged all Jewish people in the German Reich more than six years old to wear a yellow badge sewed to the left side of the garment.
Deportation from Deutz.
On 21 October 1941 the first transport left Cologne for Lodz, the last one was sent to Theresienstadt on 1 October 1944. Immediately before the transport the fair hall in Cologne-Deutz was used as a detention camp. The transports left from the underground part of the Köln Messe/Deutz Station. The deported people went to Lodz, Theresienstadt, Riga, Lublin and other ghettos and camps in the east, which were only transit points: from here they went to extermination camps.
Of special note was the deportation to Minsk on July 20, 1942, of Jewish children and some of their teachers, among them Erich Klibansky. The last to be deported in 1943 were Jewish communal workers. After that deportation the only Jews remaining were those in mixed marriages and their children, many of whom were deported in the fall of 1944.
Out of Müngersdorf and Deutz were situated also prisoners and concentration camps on a factory site in Porz Hochkreuz and also in the nearby place of Brauweiler.
When the U.S. troops occupied Cologne on 6 March 1945, between 30 and 40 Jewish men who had survived in hiding were found.
Post-war and present.
Of the 19,500 Jewish citizens of Cologne in 1930, about 11,000 were killed during by Nazi regime. Some of them were killed after they left Germany to avoid Nazi persecution. Among others, the Cologne lawyer Siegmund Klein and his son Walter Klein were killed in Auschwitz Concentration Camp, after being deported respectively from the Netherlands and France in 1943 and 1942.
The survivors of the Cologne community regathered in the ruins of the Ehrenfeld asylum, whose main building had been preserved to a large extent, for a new beginning. In Ottostraße a synagogue was also momentarily arranged, until the community could rebuild the Neo-Romanesque Lord's house at Roonstraße in 1959.
At the first post-war Christmas Eve celebrations in 1959, the synagogue and the Cologne memorial for the Victims of the Nazi regime were damaged by two members of the extreme rightist Deutsche Reichspartei, who were later arrested. The synagogue was dirtied with black, white and red color, and a swastika and the slogan "Juden raus" were added.
Rabbis active in Cologne in the postwar period were Zvi Asaria and E. Schereschewski. The "Monumenta Judaica" exhibition, reflecting 2,000 years of Jewish history and culture in the Rhineland, was shown in 1963–64.
Besides a youth center, the community maintained a Jewish home for the aged. The Jewish community numbered 1,358 in 1989 and 4,650 in 2003.
Jewish cemetery in Bocklemünd.
The Jewish cemetery of Bocklemünd has been used as a burial place since 1918 and is still used today. The Lapidarium of the cemetery hosts 58 fragments of stones between the 12th and the 15th century, that came from the Jewish cemetery of Judenbüchel in Köln-Raderberg, which was closed in 1695 with the opening of a new cemetery in Deutz and excavated in 1936. People who were buried there were moved to another grave in Bocklemünd.
Jewish centre in Nußbaumerstraße.
The Ehrenfeld Centre on the Nußbaumerstraße / Ottostraße is the successor of the "Jewish Hospital of Ehrenfeld". The hospital survived Nazism but was damaged by bomb attacks. In the building gathered the Jewish survivors of the Cologne community. The facilities that exist in the same place, today called "Jüdisches Wohlfahrtszentrum", have their origin, as the partly conserved building of the old hospital of 1908, in one of the 18th century charitable constructions in "Silvanstraße", the "Israelitische Asyl für Kranke und Altersschwache".
Jewish community in Köln-Riehl.
The Union of Progressive Jews in Germany (UPJ), founded in Munich in June 1997, is a religious association with a small Jewish liberal community in Köln-Riehl, with about 50 members and calls itself "Jüdische Liberale Gemeinde Köln Gescher LaMassoret e.V.". The community offers regular religious instruction for small children, young and adults.
Distinguished Cologne Jews in Modern Times.
Since 1861, the following persons have headed the executive board of the Jewish community of Cologne: the physician Doctor Bendix, S.M. Frank (until 1879), Jacob de Longe, Louis Elliel (until 1919), Emil Blumenau (until 1931), the lawyer Doctor H. Frank (until 1933) and consul Albert Bendix until 1939.
Until 1857, the community was managed by the Bonn Consistory and its rabbi. The first Cologne rabbi was

Memorial sites.
The Judengasse, near the Rathaus, reminds of the former Jewish quarter. During French annexion of Cologne, the Judengasse was given the name "Rue des Juifs", but renamed to its old name shortly after. Today, this area has no residential buildings.
Cologne Jewish Museum.
The municipality of Cologne, in the frame of the Regionale 2010, plans to build an "archeological area" as an archaeological-historical museum. In this context a Jewish museum should arise between the historical Rathaus and the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum over the basement of the first Cologne synagogues and ritual bath. The construction has been decided in the Council but is opposed by politics and the people, because the town loses a free square in front of the historical Rathaus. At present there are excavations on the designated site for the first time since 1950, in which part of the synagogue of the Jewish quarter should be uncovered.

Thomas Palmer (High Sheriff)

Sir Thomas Palmer (1540–1626), ‘the Travailer,’ was an English knight and politician.
Life.
Palmer was the third son of Sir Henry Palmer of Wingham, Kent, by his wife Jane, daughter of Sir Richard Windebank of Guisnes, and was nephew of Sir Thomas Palmer (died 1553). He was high sheriff of Kent in 1595, and in the following year went on the expedition to Cadiz, when he was knighted.
He was created a baronet on 29 June 1621. He died on 2 Jan. 1625–6, aged 85, and was buried at Wingham. He married Margaret, daughter of John Pooley of Badley, Suffolk, who died in August 1625, aged 85. Of his three sons, all knighted, Sir Thomas died before his father, and was himself father of Herbert Palmer. The second son, Sir Roger, was master of the household to Charles I, and the third son was James Palmer (died 1657).
Palmer was a Member of the Parliament of England in 1586 and 1601 for Arundel.
Works.
In 1606 he published ‘An Essay of the Meanes how to make our Travailes into forraine Countries the more profitable and honourable,’ London, 4to. Here Palmer discussed the advantages of foreign travel, and some of the political and commercial principles which the traveller should understand. The book is dated from Wingham, where the author is said to have kept, with great hospitality, sixty Christmases without intermission.
Others of the name.
The ‘Travailer’ must be distinguished from Thomas Palmer or Palmar, a Roman Catholic scholar, who graduated B.A. from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1553, but who subsequently became a primary scholar of St. John's College, and was in 1563 appointed principal of Gloucester Hall. He was a zealous catholic, and, after a steady refusal to conform, he had in 1564 to retire from his headship to his estates in Essex, where persecution is said to have followed him. Wood describes him as an excellent orator, and ‘the best of his time for a Ciceronian style’.

North Reef Light

North Reef Light is an active lighthouse located on North Reef, a planar reef, about northeast of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. The lighthouse was constructed on a migratory patch of sand inside a fringing coral reef, which over the years disappeared and reappeared, as sand was washed away and accumulated, and is now a vegetated sandy island. Its construction is unique, having a hollow concrete base that both gives it resistance to the shifting nature of the sandbar and serves as a fresh water tank. As such, it is considered one of the major achievement in Australian lighthouse construction. It is also notable in that due to the harsh conditions, only bachelors were allowed to serve as lighthouse keepers. At it is also the tallest of Queensland's timber framed iron clad lighthouses.
History.
The recommendation to establish a lighthouse on North Reef was made by a select parliamentary committee in 1864. The site was then a small sandbank on a coral reef. The proposal called for a cast iron cylindrical tower, in diameter and tall, which would rest on the coral, penetrating the sand. A hollow base would be formed by pouring concrete into the cylinder, which would also serve as a fresh water tank, and the residence will surround it. Tenders were called in January 1876, and the winning offer was for £7,964 by Walker and Company of Maryborough. Construction was to be completed in by July 1877 but delays, first in approval of the money and then in construction, delayed the completion until November 1878.
The base of the tower, in diameter and high, was constructed of bolted cast iron segments. Both the tower and the dwellings were constructed of timber frame, clad in galvanized iron. The original optical apparatus was a second order lens.
Conditions at the lighthouse were harsh. The location is remote, the quarters were cramped, and the shifting sands sometimes left the lighthouse surrounded by water. The lighthouse keepers chosen were therefore only single, unmarried men.
The light source was upgraded twice, in 1923 and in 1929. In 1977 the light was converted to electricity and it was demanned in January 1978. The final upgrade was on 28 September 1987 when the light was converted to solar power and six solar panels were installed on the roof of the quarters, facing north.
Current display.
The current light characteristic is two white flashes, separated by five seconds, every 15 seconds (Fl.(2)W. 15s), visible for . A racon on the tower transmits morse code "Q" (– – • –). 
The apparatus is a VRB-25, rotating at 2 rpm, and the light source is a 12 Volt 35 Watt Halogen lamp with an intensity of 35,050 cd.
Structure.
As mentioned above, the lighthouse base is made of bolted cast iron segments, in diameter and high. The tower is from the base to the lantern, conical in shape, with four intermediate floor levels. It is built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanised wrought iron plates, painted white. On top of the tower is a Chance Brothers diameter lantern, housing the VRB-25 beacon. The dome of the lantern is painted red.
The lighthouse keepers' residence surrounds the base of the tower. They comprise a ring of eight rooms, three bed rooms, 
two sitting rooms, two kitchens, and a store room. They are constructed of a timber frame with galvanised iron roof. The external walls are covered with corrugated galvanised iron sheets.
Site operation and visiting.
The site and the light are operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island is accessible by boat, but both the site and the light are closed to the public.

Kilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton

Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton is an international law firm headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The firm has seventeen offices, including U.S. offices in Georgia, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New York, Washington State, and the District of Columbia, and international offices in Japan, Shanghai, and Sweden. The firm is particularly well known for its intellectual property practice, and has represented major clients in cutting-edge IP cases. For example, the firm has represented Google in litigation related to its Google Print product, and represented Sony in its suit against 21-year-old hacker George Hotz for jailbreaking the PS3.
The firm has been recognized by "American Lawyer" magazine as one of the country's best law firms to work for (2008). It has won numerous awards for its role in community service, and it credits fifty hours of charity work per year toward its attorneys' billable hour requirements.
History.
Kilpatrick Stockton was formed by the 1997 merger of two firms, Kilpatrick & Cody of Atlanta, Georgia, and Petree Stockton of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The firm that would become Kilpatrick & Cody was founded in 1874 by Milton W. Candler and William S. Thomson. The firm became in-house counsel for the Coca-Cola company, and as early as 1893 secured federal registration of the Coca-Cola trademark.
In 1978, the firm counseled The Northwestern Bank in a merger with First Union National Bank. The transaction was a harbinger of the mass bank consolidation that would take place in the next three decades. The next year, the firm took on representation of the town of Triana, Alabama, whose water had been polluted by the pesticide DDT. The firm eventually secured a recovery of $26 million, plus all annual health care costs for the injured townspeople.
In 2000, Kilpatrick Stockton successfully represented Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s family in a lawsuit over the CBS network's unauthorized use of the famous "I Have a Dream" speech. In 2001, the firm took on the defense of the Houghton Mifflin Company's parody "The Wind Done Gone". In a precedent-setting case, the firm defeated a pre-publication restraining order from Margaret Mitchell's estate.
Also in 2001, the firm participated in a groundbreaking win in the case of Cobell v. Kempthorne. Elouise Cobell brought a class-action suit on behalf of hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs alleging that the United States mismanaged funds held by it in trust for Native Americans. The plaintiffs prevailed in the first stage of the case, proving that the government mismanaged trust funds. The accounting portion of the case has not been resolved (as of July 2006).
On January 1, 2011, Kilpatrick Stockton and Townsend and Townsend and Crew merged to form Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.
In 2011, the firm assisted Sony in its lawsuit against George Hotz and some people associated with the group fail0verflow, for "jailbreaking" the PlayStation 3. This included the attempted subpoena of Hotz's webhost to gather information about visitors to the site, as well as attempted subpoenas of YouTube, Twitter, Blogger and Paypal.

Windanya is a ghost town located between Kalgoorlie and Leonora in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
During the mid-1890s gold was discovered in the area and the "Australasia" mine was established by 1897. Following an increase in population the townsite was gazetted in 1897. 
The name was suggested by the surveyor H.S. King. It is the Aboriginal name for a place near Broad Arrow.

John Randall (Puritan)

John Randall (1570–1622), was an English puritan divine.
Randall was born in 1570 at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. At age 11, Randal was sent to St. Mary Hall (now part of Oriel College) in Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 Nov. 1581. Randall then attended Trinity College at Oxford University, and graduated with a BA degree on 9 February 1585. Randall was elected a fellow of Lincoln College at Oxford on 6 July 1587, and received his MA degree on 9 July 1589. Among his pupils at Lincoln was the puritan preacher Robert Bolton.
When Queen Elizabeth I's visited Oxford University in August 1592, Randall ran the academical performance given in her honour. Afterwards Randall studied divinity and was admitted B.D. on 28 June 1598. 
On 31 Jan. 1599, Randall was appointed rector of St. Andrew Hubbard church in Little Eastcheap, London. While at St. Andrew Hubbard, Randall gained a reputation as a staunch Puritan and an effective preacher.
In May 1622, Randall died at his house in the Minories parish in London. He was buried in St. Andrew Hubbard. In 1666, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and was never rebuilt. 
In his will, Randall gave part of his property to the poor of Great Missenden parish, All Hallows parish in Oxford, and St. Andrew's parish; a tenement called Ship Hall; and to Lincoln College. The rest of his estate went to relatives. Randall's wife and daughter predeceased him. His portrait, painted when he was fellow of Lincoln College, hangs in the common room there.
In addition to separate sermons, published posthumously by his friend William Holbrook, Randall left for publication "Three-and-Twenty Sermons or Catechisticall Lectures upon the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, preached Monthly before the Communion," London, 1630, 4to; published by his executor, Joshua Randall.

Maboko Island

Maboko Island is a small island lying in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province of western Kenya. It is about 1.8 km long by 1 km wide. It is an important Middle Miocene paleontological site with fossiliferous deposits that were discovered in the 1930s. The age of the deposits is estimated to be , and they are especially important for the abundance of primate fossils they contain.
Excavations.
Miocene fossils in the fluvial deposits of Maboko was first discovered by Archdeacon W.E. Owen in 1933, who started an excavation later that year which yielded a lot of vertebrate fossils. Owen's excavations continued the following two years supervised by Donald Gordon MacInnes. Then few expeditions visited the island before MacInnes returned together with Louis Leakey in 1947. These excavations resulted in a large number of craniodental (crania and teeth) remains of a medium seized cercopithecoid monkey and cranial and postcranial remains of a large anthropoid ape — later to become the holotypes "Victoriapithecus macinnesi" and "Sivapithecus africanus".
Leakey and D.M.S. Watson returned to Maboko in 1949 to collect a large amount of specimen, including an isolated molar later attributed to "Limnopithecus legetet". Leakey returned again in 1951 and found fossils of new holotypes: "Victoriapithecus leakeyi", "Mabokopithecus clarki", and "Nyanzapithecus pickfordi".
An expedition in 1973 lead by D.R. Pilbeam resulted in over 80 primate specimen. Most of them could be attributed to "Victoriapithecus" but some were assigned to new species. In 1982 and 1983, Martin Pickford searched the deposit dumps left by Owen in 1933 and by Leakey in 1949 and unveiled over 500 isolated specimen of at least five antropoid primates, later assigned to "Kenyapithecus africanus". "Mabokopithecus clarki", "Micropithecus", "Victoriapithecus macinnesi", and "Nyanzapithecus pickfordi".

Bobby Fite

Bobby Fite (born October 22, 1968) is an American former film and television actor. Beginning his professional career as a child actor and model at the age of six, Fite is perhaps best known for his recurring role as J.T. Martin on the popular NBC comedy series "Silver Spoons", as well as for his feature film roles in "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas", "The Legend of Billie Jean", and "Explorers".
Early life.
Fite was born Robert Nelson Fite on October 22, 1968 in Dallas, Texas to parents Roselle and Robert Fite. Growing up in Dallas, Fite began his show business career at the age of six after taking it upon himself to contact local talent agent Kim Dawson. When recounting the experience years later, Dawson explained, "He said, 'I want to be an actor.' I remember how amazed I was. I told him what he'd have to do, and he said, 'I can do that.'" In the following years, Fite worked as a child actor and model, appearing in local commercials and print advertorials. With his youthful "boyish" looks and Texas drawl, Fite was often cast as the southern boy, primarily playing roles several years younger than his actual age throughout most of his career as a child star.
Career.
Early career.
In 1982, Fite made his television debut with a co-starring role in the NBC movie-of-the-week, "The Long Summer of George Adams". Premiering on "NBC's Monday Night at the Movies" in January 1982, but filmed when he was twelve years old, Fite portrayed Bill Adams, one of three sons to James Garner's character John Adams, an Oklahoma railroad man in the 1950s, whose job is threatened when plans are made to replace steam engines with diesels. In July of that year, Fite made his feature film debut with a small role as Dulcie Mae's son in Universal's film adaptation of the Broadway musical-comedy "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas", starring Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. In December of that same year, Fite appeared in a co-starring role in the CBS television movie "Miss All-American Beauty". In the film, Fite portrayed Petey Butterfield, the youngest of two brothers to Diane Lane's character, Sally Butterfield, a girl who struggles with her newfound notoriety and responsibilities after winning a Texas beauty pageant.
Rise to fame.
In January 1983, Fite landed a recurring role on the popular NBC comedy series "Silver Spoons". On the series, Fite portrayed the smooth-talking cowboy with a Texas twang, J.T. Martin, a role that established him as a teen idol among the show's teen and tween audience alongside the show's other teen stars Ricky Schroder and Jason Bateman. Fite was a recurring guest-star on the series for two seasons, and in 1983, his portrayal earned him a Youth in Film Award (now known as the Young Artist Award) nomination as "Best Young Actor in a Comedy Series". Later that same year, Fite appeared in his first starring role in an episode of "CBS Children's Mystery Theatre", an hour-long anthology showcase for children's films much like the "ABC Afterschool Specials" and "ABC Weekend Specials" of the 1970s and 1980s. In the episode entitled "The Dirkham Detective Agency", Fite starred as David, a pre-teen detective, alongside fellow child stars, Mara Hobel ("Mommie Dearest") and Leo O'Brien ("The Last Dragon"), out to solve their first case after two poodles are "dog-napped". On October 21 of that year, Fite guest-starred on the popular CBS series "The Dukes of Hazzard". In the episode entitled "The Boar's Nest Bears", Fite portrayed Tommy, one of the farm boys on Hazzard County's pee-wee basketball team owned by Boss Hogg. On October 29 of that same year, Fite guest-starred on the CBS Saturday morning science-fiction series, "Benji, Zax & the Alien Prince". In the episode entitled "The Locals", Fite portrayed Will, the leader of a gang of bullies who cause trouble for the series' three titular characters.
In 1985, After finishing two seasons on "Silver Spoons", Fite returned to the big screen with a role in the feature film "Papa Was a Preacher". In the film, Fite portrayed Eric Lee, one of a team of country brothers who bully a Preacher's sons in a rural 1950s Texas town. In July of that year, Fite was once again cast as the "bully" in Joe Dante's science fiction comedy "Explorers". In the film, Fite portrayed Steve Jackson, the leader of a gang of boys who torment the film's protagonists, Ben Crandall (Ethan Hawke) and Wolfgang Müller (River Phoenix). While not considered a commercial success at the time, the film was the feature film debut of both Hawke and Phoenix, and has become something of a cult favorite among fans of 80s sci-fi cinema. One week later, what would be Fite's final feature film appearance, "The Legend of Billie Jean" was released to theaters. In the film, Fite appeared as a boy who crosses paths with the film's leads, Billie Jean Davy (Helen Slater), and Binx Davy (Christian Slater) outside a mini-mart as they try and outrun the law. The film was Christian Slater's film debut, and yet another example of a perceived box office "failure" at the time of its release, however, it too has become considered something of a cult classic among many 80s film fans today. In November 1985, Fite appeared in what would be his final starring role on the short-lived ABC mystery-suspense series "Shadow Chasers". In the two-hour pilot episode, Fite guest-starred as Billy Pence, a boy who works with paranormal investigators when he believes a small town is being haunted by his late father's ghost.
Later career.
Throughout the rest of the 1980s, Fite worked behind the scenes on film sets, but did not appear on camera again until 1992, when he returned to acting with a small role in the suspense-thriller "Fatal Charm". In the film, Fite portrayed "Bud", a high-school acquaintance of Valerie, played by his former "Explorers" co-star Amanda Peterson, who finds danger after she falls in love with serial killer, Adam Brenner, portrayed by Christopher Atkins. Although filmed in 1989 and intended for a cable television release, the film was "shelved" for almost 3 years due to post-production and marketing difficulties and was never aired on cable, but instead was released direct-to-video in February 1992. In September 1994, Fite appeared in what would be his final on-screen role in an episode of "Walker, Texas Ranger". In the episode entitled "Badge of Honor", Fite made a cameo appearance in the episode's final scene as a UPS man who delivers a package to Walker.
Personal life.
After leaving show business, Fite returned to Dallas, Texas and married Cynthia Hayden in 1996. The two did not have any children together and eventually divorced. In 2002, Fite began working as a home developer for American Home Remodeling L.C. As of 2011, Fite works as a sales consultant for the Pulte/Centex Corporation and is married to second wife Kristen Tucker-Pittman. The two reside in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and live in a custom home he helped to design.

Bell Syndicate

The Bell Syndicate, launched in 1916 by editor-publisher John Neville Wheeler, was an American syndicate which distributed columns, fiction, feature articles and comic strips to newspapers for decades. It was located in New York at 247 West 43rd Street and later at 229 West 43rd Street. It also published comic strips in book form. 
In 1913, while working as a sportswriter for the "New York Herald", Wheeler formed the Wheeler Syndicate to specialize in distribution of sports features to newspapers in the United States and Canada. That same year his Wheeler Syndicate contracted with pioneering comic strip artist Bud Fisher and cartoonist Fontaine Fox to begin distributing their work. 
Journalist Richard Harding Davis was sent to Belgium as war correspondent and reported on early battlefield actions, as the Wheeler Syndicate became a comprehensive news collection and distribution operation. In 1916, it was purchased by the McClure Syndicate, the oldest and largest news and feature syndicate in America.
Immediately upon the sale of the Wheeler Syndicate to the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, Wheeler founded the Bell Syndicate, which soon attracted Fisher, Fox and other cartoonists. Ring Lardner began writing a sports column for Bell in 1919. In 1924, Wheeler became executive editor of "Liberty" and served in that capacity while continuing to run Bell Syndicate.
In 1930, he became general manager of North American Newspaper Alliance, established in 1922 by 50 major newspapers in the United States and Canada which absorbed Bell, both continuing to operate individually under joint ownership. NANA continued to acquire other syndicates, including the McClure Syndicate.
Comic strips.
Comic strips distributed by the Bell Syndicate:
Writers and columnists.
Kathleen Caesar was the Bell Syndicate's editor. Henry M. Snevily was the firm's president with Joseph P. Agnelli as executive vice-president and general manager. His wife, Muriel Agnelli, wrote the "Dorothy Dix" advice column; it ran in 160 newspapers, and in 20 newspapers it appeared under the byline Muriel Nissen, her maiden name. Elizabeth Meriwether Gilmer wrote the "Dorothy Dix" advice column until her death in 1951, when Muriel Agnelli took over. Born in Manhattan, Muriel Agnelli attended Hunter College and also studied journalism and psychology at Columbia University. After marrying in 1929, she began editing Bell's four-page children's tabloid, the "Sunshine Club", and she later wrote a column about stamps and stamp collecting.
The syndicate also distributed James J. Montague's column "More Truth than Poetry" as well as many other articles and light fiction pieces. 
Film critic Mordaunt Hall was a Bell copy editor, and he also contributed articles. Drew Pearson's "Washington-Merry-Go-Round" column was carried in 600 newspapers. The liberal Washington columnist Doris Fleeson wrote a daily Bell political column from 1945 to 1954.

AirDrop

AirDrop is an ad-hoc service in Apple Inc.'s OS X and iOS operating systems, introduced in Mac OS X Lion (OS X 10.7) and iOS 7 that enables users to transfer files to another supported Mac computer and iOS mobile device without using email or a mass storage device. OS X and iOS use different AirDrop protocols and are currently not interoperable. AirDrop in OS X operates over Wi-Fi, whereas the iOS implementation utilizes both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. 
There is currently no size restriction to how large a file can be sent over AirDrop, Apple users have reported movie files over 10GB being sent over AirDrop without any problems. A restriction on AirDrop is that the two computers have to be within 10 meters of each other for AirDrop to recognize the other party. To date only a small number of applications implement the AirDrop facility.
Routine.
On devices using OS X 10.7, AirDrop is available through a special folder in Finder, and as of OS X 10.8.1 can be accessed through the menu option Go > AirDrop or by pressing ++. For the feature to work, Wi-Fi must be turned on in order for AirDrop to recognize the other device. The other device must also use the same AirDrop folder in Finder to be able to transfer files. Furthermore, files are not automatically accepted; the receiving user must be willing to accept the transfer. This is done to increase security and prevent others from tracking who is nearby.
On iOS 7, AirDrop can be set only through the Control Center introduced in iOS 7. It is located just below the quick toggles. Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth must be activated for AirDrop to work. There are also a variety of options to increase the security of AirDrop, on activation, including:
Sharing on iOS is different from versions 10.7 to 10.9. Starting with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, the old version of AirDrop for mac has been replaced with the one for iOS. However, a legacy mode will exist in Yosemite for compatibility with Mavericks and prior versions. On supporting versions of iOS, if an application implements AirDrop, it is available through the share button. AirDrop is subject to a number of other restrictions, such as inability to share music from an iPod app. On supporting versions of OS X, any file or folder can be dragged to send.
In both instances, AirDrop appears as floating bubbles in the Finder, it will usually show the other person's computer name and photo. The design of AirDrop gives it the essence of a military radar type display; however, users appear randomly on the AirDrop page and there is no pattern to how near or far away they are.
System limitations.
AirDrop is not officially supported on older devices (iPhone 4S and earlier) because of hardware limitations, and can be used only on these models, or newer ones:
Running iOS 7 or later: 
AirDrop can be enabled unofficially on iPad (3rd generation). Although not supported by default, AirDrop can be enabled on this device by jailbreaking the device and installing "AirDrop Enabler 7.0+" from cydia. Note that this procedure is not supported by Apple.
Running Mac OS X Lion (10.7) or later:
AirDrop is also available on Hackintoshes (generic PCs running OS X) that have AirDrop-supported Wi-Fi cards, such as Broadcom's 4322/94322. Despite Apple's legal restrictions, developers have found that AirDrop can be enabled on any Macintosh running OS X Lion with a shell command, and will work over Ethernet as well. In order to get AirDrop to work, both Mac have to use the same language.

Flat Top Island Light

Flat Top Island Light is an inactive lighthouse located on Flat Top Island, a small island off the entrance to Mackay harbor at the mouth of Pioneer River, about east of Mackay, Queensland, Australia. It used to mark the river entrance for shipping and the direction of the port, as well as highlighting close-by shoals at Shoalwater Point and a reef off Hay Point. At from the ground to the lantern floor, it is the shortest of Queensland's timber framed iron clad lighthouses.
History.
Tenders for the construction of the lighthouse were called on February 1877, and the tender accepted on September of that year was by Archibald McIntyre. Construction commenced on December 1877 and complete on May 1878. However, the lighthouse was not officially lit, as the permanent apparatus was not available and a temporary one was used. The light was officially lit only on 27 December 1879 with the installation of the permanent apparatus. As typical for lighthouses of that period in Queensland, the tower is conical in shape, built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanized iron plates. The foundation was deep and wide, made of stone and concrete. The lighthouse diameter is at the bottom and at the top. The height of the tower is from the ground to the balcony, making it the shortest of the composite lighthouses ever built in Queensland. From the ground to the top the height reported on construction was , with the light being shown at . However, the height was no hindrance, as the focal height was . The permanent light installed was a fixed fourth order dioptric and was visible for . It showed white light for directions clear of danger (except where obscured by the close-by Round Top Island) and red over danger. An additional red sector was later installed to show further dangerous locations. The lighthouse is currently painted white with a red dome.
In January 1918 the lighthouse was the only structure on the island and the only aid to navigation to survive the 1918 Mackay cyclone. The lighthouse was automated around 1920. In 1991, the light source was still an open flame acetylene gas burner.
The light was discontinued in March 2007 and it is currently conserved on site. The last light characteristic displayed was four flashes every twenty seconds, red and white depending on the direction (Fl.(4)W.R. 20s).
Site operation and visiting.
The lighthouse is currently inactive. Before that, it was operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island is accessible only by boat. It is unclear whether public access to the site and tower are available.

Edward Randolph (soldier)

Edward Randolph (died 1566), was an English soldier.
Randolph was probably a brother of Thomas Randolph (1523–1590), was born at Badlesmere in Kent. He made himself sufficiently prominent in Edward VI's time to find it necessary to flee to Paris on the accession of Mary. But, like other rebels, he soon tired of exile, and his known value as a soldier rendered the negotiations for his pardon easy. Wotton wrote to Petre on 17 April 1554, recommending him to mercy; but Mary wrote in May that, though he was forgiven, he must stay and supply information as to the movements of his friends. The formal grant of pardon is dated 9 October 1554. He soon found favour, and on 3 April 1555 Philip wrote to his treasurer, Dominico d'Orbea, ordering a pension of two hundred crowns to be paid to Randolph, who is described as colonel of infantry.
Under Elizabeth he was at first employed in Scotland. On 1 April 1560 Grey, writing to Norfolk, alluded to ‘good Mr. Randall's stout and valiant endeavour;’ and Cecil, writing from Edinburgh on 26 June, speaks of his worth. As a reward he was offered the post of marshal of Berwick, but refused it. In 1563 he was made marshal of Havre (then called in England Newhaven), and aided the French Huguenots with two hundred men. In July 1563 he was ill of the plague. Elizabeth, on Randolph's return to England, made him lieutenant-general of ordnance, and colonel of footmen in Ireland. There he soon had plenty of fighting, and was killed in a battle with O'Neil at Knockfergus on 12 November 1566. A poetical epitaph is in Egerton MS. 2642, f. 198.

St. Thomas Syro-Malabar Catholic Cathedral, Irinjalakuda

St Thomas Cathedral & Bishop House.
The Cathedral Church of the eparchy of Irinjalakuda got its present existence under the nomenclature and the Canonical Status as Cathedral in the Wake of the Origin of the New Eparchy. This was effected by the amalgamation of the two independent and important parishes of the locality, namely, St. George’s Forane Church and St. Mary’s church, which amicably situated side by side for about a century. Each had its several institutions and properties as well as high resources. St. George Church is chronologically prior as it was established in 1845 AD. This originated at the request of the Christian merchants who migrated to Irinjalakuda during the regime of Rama Varma Thampuran (known as “Sakthan Thampuran” – 1790-1805) the king of Kochi. He invited the Christian merchants from the neighboring ancient Catholic regions such as Velayanad, Mapranam, Kalparambu etc. in view of trade and industry. Thus a small Church was constructed here, then known as Kombarakunnu under the guidance of the Parish Priest of Mapranam Church. Later they tried for building a spacious Church. However, in 1874 the so-called “Mellus Schism” affected the area and the majority succumbed to it. But a ministry resisted and tried to continue in the papal allegiance. With that view they constructed a new and better Church in 1880 and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary (ST. Mary’s Church). Gradually several religious, educational and charitable institutions came up and flourished in the area. Though the Mellusian group got away from that influence and rejoined the Papal allegiance, both the Churches remained side by side as separate Catholic Parishes without territorial limits. They cherished Concord and Cordiality. In 1944 St. George Church was raised to the Status of a Forane Church. 
But in the wake of the new eparchy with its title and headquarters in the municipal town of Irinjalakuda, the ecclesiastical authorities thought it better and convenient to amalgamate them as a Single Canonical parish to form the Cathedral of the new eparchy. Subsequently in consultation with the parish priest, Trustees and Representatives of both the parishes, Mar Joseph Kundukulam, then Bishop of Trichur could effectively amalgamate them so as to form a Cathedral Parish, newly dedicated to St. Thomas the Apostle in 1978. While St. George’s Forane Church was changed to be St. Thomas Cathedral Church, St. Mary’s Church was temporarily used as Bishop’s Chapel (Mar James Pazhayattil) and subsequently named as Spirituality Centre. Irinajalakuda is well known for its religious harmony, marketing and commercial facilities. 
The Cathedral Parish has, at present a Catholic population of 14,552, belonging to 2921 families. Apart from the Eparchial office and related institutions, numerous religious institutes, formation houses, as well as catechetical, educational and service centers took their origin with the benign and generous support of the Catholic Community of the area. The major religious institution to be mentioned is the Udaya Provincial House belonging to the Congregation of the Mother of Carmel. The Cathedral Parish also has its own multifarious institutes and associations thriving full swing.
History.
St Thomas, one of the apostles of Christ, after receiving the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, set about the mission of spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ to the whole world. A review of the life of St Thomas will prove how he fulfilled this great mission in India.
According to the tradition, St Thomas came by sea and landed at Kodungalloor (Cranganore) the capital of the then Chera Empire in the year 52 A.D. He baptised families in Kodungalloor and Palayur (Trichur). St Thomas preached the gospel wherever he went, and founded churches. 
According to Malabar tradition St Thomas founded seven churches, they are in Cranganore, Quilon, Chayal, Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Paravur and Palayur. From there he went to Coromandel and suffered martyrdom near the Little Mount in Tamil Nadu. His body was brought to the town of Mylapore and was buried in a holy shrine.According to "Ramban songs" St Thomas converted 17550 people. He ordained priests and consecrated Bishops. The Apostle consecrated Kepa, a native, as Bishop of Kodungalloor and as the head of St Thomas Christians and Paul as the Bishop of Mylapore. It is worth mentioning that the Apostle gave his followers a way of worship suited to their clime, culture and customs. Since the 4th century, the church in India started communication with the East Syrian Church and soon began to introduce liturgical books and share rites. Thus the Indian Church became a member of the Syro-Chaldean Patriarchate for practical purpose, not for doctrinal reasons.
The head of the Indian Church was called The Metropolitan and Gate of All India and had jurisdiction all over the country. When the Chaldean prelates came to India as the spiritual heads of the independent Metropolitan provinces under the East Syrian Patriarch, the administration of the Indian Church was done by a native priest with the title Archdeacon of all India or Jathikkukarthavian. The residence of the Metropolitan was first at Kodungallur, then Angamaly etc.. Because of the close association of the St Thomas Christians with the East Syrian Church, the Indian Church of St Thomas is classified in history under the Chaldean matrix of rites, as we read in CCEO C.28:2 As Pope Pius XII said “during the centuries that India was cut off from the west and despite many trying vicissitudes, the Christian communities formed by the Apostle conserved intact the legacy he left them, and as soon as the sea passage at the close of the 15th century offered a link with their fellow Christians of the west, the union with them was spontaneous (AAS, XLV (1953) PP. 96 97). Thus the Syro-Malabar Church, as Pope John Paul II said, “Never severed from the communion with the Church of Rome, in a continuity that the enormous geographic distance has never been able to break. (“Insegnamenti Giovanni Paulo II.” III/2. Roma, 1980, P. 513). In the 15th and 16th centuries the metropolitans of the St Thomas Christians, who were then East Syrians, took Angamaly as their residential see. (cf. Bulls of Pope Julius III dated 10 March 1553 and 4 May 1553 in Giamil, “Genuinae Relationes...” Rome 1902, PP. 17–18-24).
In the history of the St Thomas Christians the arrival of the Portuguese missionaries to India during the 16th century was a turning point. The western missionaries helped the growth of the Indian Church, at the same time it also distorted the juridical and liturgical identity of the St Thomas Christians. After the Synod of Udayam-peroor (Diamper) in the year 1599, Mgr. Francis Roz, a Portuguese missionary, was appointed the first Latin Bishop for the Metropolitan See of St Thomas Christians. On the 4th of August, 1600 the Portuguese Padroado jurisdiction was extended to Kodungalloor & Archdiocese of Angamaly was reduced as a suffragan to the Archdiocese Goa. The residential See of the bishop was transferred from Angamaly to Kodungalloor in 1607 in the light of the letter of permission of Pope Paul V, dated 20 August 1605. On December 22, 1608, the Metropolitan status of the See of Kodungalloor was restored by Pope Paul V. He ordered the geographical division of Cochin and Kodungalloor Angamaly (cf. Bull of Pope Paul V dated, 12 October 1609 “Bullarium Patronatus Portugalliae” Vol II, P. 14) as a compromise formula for settling a jurisdictional dispute between the Bishop of Cochin and Bishop Francis Roz of Kodungalloor - Angamaly. On 22 December 1610 Archbishop Menezes of Goa issued a decree restricting the jurisdictional rights of the Metropolitan of St Thomas Christians to certain areas in the present states of Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh (cf. “Bullarium Romanum...” Vol. XI PP. 606–608)
The Policy of latinisation by the missionaries caused dispute and resistance among the St Thomas Christians and it resulted in a revolt in the year 1653 called “Coonan Cross Oath” and the ensuing fraction of Puthenkoottukar. To remedy this situation the Propaganda jurisdiction was also introduced on the St Thomas Christians. The St Thomas Christians were then divided among themselves under the two Latin Jurisdictions of Padroado and Propaganda. And the rebel bishops who headed the Puthenkoottukar in course of time separated themselves from the Catholic communion and became Jacobites. In the 18th century the Metropolitan residence of Cranganore was transferred to the neighbouring catholic centre, Puthenchira.
In 1865 the jurisdiction of the East Syrian Patriarch over the Church of the St Thomas Christians was formally terminated by the Apostolic See. In 1886 the Metropolitan See of Cranganore was suppressed and the St Thomas Christians were put under Verapoly which was later raised to the status of an Archdiocese with the establishment of the Latin Hierarchy in India under the Propaganda Fide. The title of ‘Metropolitan of Cranganore’ was given ad honorem to the Bishop of Damao. When the See of Damao was annexed to that of Goa the Goan Archbishop began to carry the title of Cranganore also.
On 20 May 1887, Pope Leo XIII of illustrious memory by the bull Quod Jampridem reorganised the St Thomas Christians under two vicariates of Trichur and Kottayam. On 28 July 1896 by the bull Quae rei sacrae, the same Pope reconstituted the two vicariates into three vicariates of Trichur, Ernakulam and Changanacherry and appointed natives as bishops. These Catholic St Thomas Christians were then called ‘The Syro-Malabar Church’. In 1911 the Vicariate Apostolic of Kottayam was erected for the Southists.
By the epoch making constitution Romani Pontifices of 21 December 1923, Pope Pius XI erected the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy and thus restored, to some extent, the hierarchical rule of the St Thomas Christians. But the form of Government was that of a Latin Metropolitan Province. Ernakulam was raised to the Metropolitan status and the eparchies of Trichur, Changanacherry and Kottayam were made its suffragans. In 1955 the territory of jurisdiction was extended to some districts in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In 1956 Changanacherry also was raised to the Metropolitan status. By the time the number of eparchies had increased to seven.
The growth of the Syro-Malabar Church in the 20th century is widely admitted as marvellous. This energetic Church took up challenges in the Mission fields and thus from 1962 Syro-Malabar Exarchates began to be established outside Kerala. In 1977 the Exarchates were elevated to the status of Eparchies.
The Syro-Malabar Church, having 12 eparchies in Kerala under two Metropolitans - Ernakulam and Changanacherry - and 9 eparchies outside Kerala under Latin Provinces, was found in an anomalous situation when CCEO was promulgated in 1990. Taking into consideration the age old traditions and the enormous growth of the Apostolic and Indian Church and in order to rectify the above anomaly, Pope John Paul II, by the constitution “Quae Maiori”, dated 16 December 1992, raised the Syro-Malabar Church to the status of Major Archiepiscopal Sui iuris Church with the title of Ernakulam - Angamaly. The erection was published on 29 January 1993. The Metropolitan of Ernakulam, Mar Antony Cardinal Padiyara, was made the Major Archbishop. The proper territory of the Major Archbishop was determined to the territory of the two provinces of Ernakulam and Changanacherry. The Installation of the Major Archbishop and the inauguration of the first Synod of Bishops of the Syro-Malabar Major Archiepiscopal Church was held at Ernakulam on 20 May 1993. In 1995 the Eparchies of Trichur and Tellicerry were elevated to the Metropolitan status. A new eparchy of Thuckalay was erected in 1996 in the province of Changanacherry. Bifurcating Tellicherry, the eparchy of Belthangady was erected in 1999. Another Eparchy was erected in Chicago for the Syro-Malabar migrants in February 2001. It is considered to be a remarkable event and milestone in the history of the Syro-Malabar Church. Similarly, the new eparchy of Idukki was erected in January 2003. On 21 August 2007 a new Eparchy of Badravathi was erected, bifurcating the Diocese of Mananthavady. Two new Eparchies, Ramanatha-puram and Mandia erected on February 2010. At present the Syro-Malabar Major Archiepiscopal Church is having 18 Eparchies inside its proper territory under 5 Metropolitan sees and 11 Eparchies outside the proper territory.

John Rastell (Jesuit)

John Rastell (1532–1577), was an English Jesuit.
Rastell was born at Gloucester in 1532, was admitted into Winchester School in 1543; and thence proceeded to New College, Oxford, of which he became a perpetual fellow in 1549. He graduated M.A. 29 July 1555, and about that time was ordained priest. Being unable to comply with the religious changes in Elizabeth's reign, he left his college, ‘wherein he had always been accounted an excellent disputant,’ and retired to Louvain. He removed to Antwerp in 1564, and subsequently went to Rome, where he entered the jesuit novitiate of St. Andrew 6 April 1568, being, for a short time, fellow-novice with St. Stanislas Kostka. After completing his noviceship, he was English penitentiary for a time at St. Peter's, Rome. He was then sent as confessor and consultor to the house of the jesuits at Hall. Thence he was removed to Augsburg, and finally to Ingoldstadt, where he was appointed vice-rector of the college of his order. He died in the college on 15 or 17 June 1577. Wood, Dodd, and Oliver incorrectly state that he died about 1600.
He was a determined antagonist of Bishop Jewell, and published: 1. ‘A Confutation of a Sermon pronounced by M. Iuell, at Paules crosse, the second Sondaie before Easter … Anno Dñi M.D.L.X.,’ Antwerp (Giles Diest) 21 Nov. 1564, 8vo, ff. 176. The latter part of the work is entitled ‘A Challenge against the Protestants.’ The ‘Confutation’ was answered in 1579 by Dr. William Fulke 2. ‘A Replie against an Answer (falslie intitled) in Defence of the Truth, made by Iohn Rastell: M. of Art and Studient in Diuinite,’ Antwerp (Giles Diest), 10 March 1565, 8vo, ff. 205. 3. ‘A Copie of a Challenge, taken owt of the Confutation of M. Iuells Sermon,’ Antwerp, 1565, 8vo. 4. ‘A Treatise intitled, Beware of M. Iewell,’ Antwerp, 1566, 8vo, in three volumes or parts, the last of which is entitled ‘The third Book, declaring by examples out of ancient Councels, Fathers, and later Writers, that it is time to beware of M. Jewel.’ 5. ‘A Briefe Shew of the false Wares packt together in the named Apology of the Church of England,’ Louvain (John Fowler), 1567, 8vo. A catalogue of ‘English Popish Books,’ printed by Strype, includes Rastell's ‘Return of Untruths,’ which was answered by Jewell.

Wilesco

Wilesco is the trade name of German toy company "Wilhelm Schröder GmbH & Co. KG", known for manufacturing live steam toys such as steamrollers, traction engines, and stationary steam engines.
Initially a producer of aluminium forks and spoons, the company expanded into miniature aluminium accessories for doll's tea parties in the 1920s. This decision also helped the company weather the economic crisis of the late 1920s and early 1930s because these toys were also exported to the US.
In 1950, Wilesco started manufacturing miniature steam engines. In 1966, the D 365 "Old Smokey" steamroller was introduced which has been popular among collectors and continues to be produced.
The company also manufactures various accessories for their steam engines such as electrical generators, steam workshops and fairground rides. While most of their steam engine models are heated by esbit, electrical heating is also available. Steam-powered toy locomotives (G scale) are also available from Wilesco.
The company still manufactures a range of plastic and aluminium scoops and hooks.
Wilesco's main rival is the British based steam model manufacturer: Mamod. Mamod and Wilesco produce similar models, at similar prices and size range.

Cyrenaica Emirate

The Emirate of Cyrenaica, or "Principality of Cyrenaica", came into existence when Sayyid Idris unilaterally proclaimed Cyrenaica an independent Senussi emirate on 1 March 1949, backed by the United Kingdom. Sayyid Idris proclaimed himself Emir of Cyrenaica at a 'national conference' in Benghazi. The recognition by the UK failed to influence the attitude of the United Nations, and Britain and France were directed to prepare Libya's independence in a resolution passed on 21 November 1949. The independence of the United Kingdom of Libya was declared on 24 December 1951, and on 27 December, Emir Idris was enthroned as King Idris I.
The black flag with white star and crescent symbol was adopted by Idris as he was proclaimed Emir in 1947. The flag became the basis of the flag of Libya of 1951, with the addition of a red and a green stripe, representing the blood of the Martyrs and prosperity, respectively. Idris as king of Libya kept the flag of the emirate as his personal Royal Standard, with the addition of a white crown in the upper hoist.
On 6 March 2012, mirroring the events 63 years earlier, a similar kind of meeting was held in Benghazi, calling for more autonomy and federalism for Cyrenaica. Ahmed al-Senussi, a relative of King Idris, was announced as the leader of the self-declared Cyrenaica Transitional Council.

<doc id="31034670" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31034670" title="Walter Koch (Fallschirmjäger)">
Walter Koch (Fallschirmjäger)

Walter Koch (10 September 1910 – 23 October 1943) was a highly-decorated commander of the Fallschirmjäger during World War II who died in mysterious circumstances after openly criticising Adolf Hitler. Koch, who was the recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions during the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael in May 1940, had publicly denounced the Führer's infamous Commando Order, which ordered that all captured enemy commandos were to be executed. Shortly afterwards the "Oberstleutnant" and commander of "Fallschirmjäger-Regiment 5" died in Berlin from injuries allegedly resulting from a motor vehicle collision.
Early career.
Walter Koch joined the "Landespolizei" as an officer in 3 April 1929. As a "Leutnant" he had served in the state police and a police battalion for special purposes ("Polizeiabteilung z.b.V. Wecke"). In 1935 the new commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, transferred this police unit into the reformed Luftwaffe and renamed it the Regiment "General Göring".
Airborne service.
Koch was promoted to "Hauptmann" (Captain) on 20 April 1938. He was then tasked with training a special commando unit dubbed Koch Parachute Assault Battalion ("Fallschirmjäger-Sturm-Abteilung "Koch"") for operations in the west.
When "Fall Gelb" began in May 1940, his troops saw action during the opening phase of the Battle of France during assaults on the Belgian fortress Eben-Emael, the Maas river and Albert Canal bridges. Koch's commandos successfully captured Fort Eben-Emael and the bridges in Veldwezelt and Vroenhoeven. Only the bridge at Kanne, which was blown up by the Belgian defenders, was not taken by the German paratroopers. For these successful operations, Walter Koch along with ten other "Wehrmacht" officers received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ().
By May 1941, Koch was promoted to Major and given the command of the re-designated I Battalion, 1st Parachute Assault Regiment ("I./Fallschirmjäger-Sturm-Regiment 1") The battalion was part of the first attacking airborne waves during the Battle of Crete. Koch led the attack using 53 DFS 230 troop-carrying gliders. Their target was the village of Maleme on the western coast of Crete because its small coastal airfield and Hill 107 commanded the approaches to the island's capital. The German troops faced the New Zealanders of 5 Brigade's 22nd Battalion, with other battalions close behind, under the command of Brigadier Edward Puttick. Although Koch was wounded in the head in the battle for Hill 107 on the first day, his airborne troops quickly achieved their targets.
Koch was promoted to "Oberstleutnant" (Lieutenant Colonel) on 20 April 1942. He and the 5th Parachute Regiment ("Fallschirmjäger-Regiment 5") were transferred to Tunisia in mid November 1942.
Opposition to the Commando Order.
In his regiment's first African engagement two weeks later, Koch's troops encountered the British 2nd Parachute Battalion under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Dutton Frost at Depienne Airfield 53 km southwest of Tunis.
Frost had left a number of injured men under the protection of a single platoon behind at the airfield while he and his forces went on to other targets. On their discovery, the British paratroopers were quickly captured by Koch's troops and made prisoners of war (POW). The German commander then ordered his medics to treat the wounded. Before leaving, he ensured that the prisoners were given food and water, and even cigarettes, before handing them over to other Axis ground forces.
However Koch and the commander of the I Battalion, 5th Parachute Regiment "Hauptmann" Hans Jungwirth returned just in time to stop the machine gunning of the captured British soldiers. After a heated debate with another German officer about the Commando Order, Koch managed to obtain adequate treatment for the allies prisoners who were instead transferred to a POW camp.
Death.
Shortly after stopping the killing of POWs in North Africa, Koch was wounded in the head. The highly-experienced combat leader was sent back to Germany to recover from his wounds; while there he was placed in the "Führerreserve". While convalescing he was involved in car accident, he died in a Berlin Hospital from these injuries in October 1943. However many in his regiment believed that this was no accident and he had been most likely killed by the "SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt" because of his outspoken criticism of the Commando Order.

Hurray for the Riff Raff

Hurray for the Riff Raff is an American folk-blues and southern gothic Americana band from New Orleans, Louisiana.
Background.
Alynda Lee Segarra.
Hurray for the Riff Raff is a music collective that was formed by singer-songwriter and banjo player Alynda Lee Segarra.
Segarra grew up in the Bronx, and is of Puerto Rican descent. She says she was raised by her aunt Nereida and though she was distant from her mother she remained very close to her father as a child.
When she was between 13 and 14 years old, "the minute I could take the subway by myself, I headed to the Lower East Side because I knew that's where all the weirdos were, where all the punks were. I was always taking an hour subway ride out there. And that's really where I feel like I grew up because I spent so much of my time there—all of my friends were there. That's where I learned a lot about New York and about the world, really." Segarra became a regular attendee of hardcore punk shows at ABC No Rio.
Segarra left her home in the Bronx at age 17, spending time crossing North America, hopping freight trains. "I grew up with my aunt and uncle who raised me, and they were really really great parents, you know? But it was mostly just about how I felt like I didn't know how I could grow in NYC. I felt stifled there in certain ways, even though I loved it," Segarra said, referring to how big New York City was. 
Dead Man Street Orchestra.
During this time, around 2007, Segarra became a part of the Dead Man Street Orchestra, a band that was documented in a photo essay by "Time Magazine" in 2007.
Hurray for the Riff Raff.
After playing the washboard for a while, Segarra picked up the banjo that a close friend had given her and began writing her own songs. Segarra, drummer/violinist Yosi Perlstein.
"NPR" describes the band: "As a group, Hurray for the Riff Raff is, and has always been, proof that millennials are not lazy or unobservant or wandering — or, more accurately for the famously peripatetic Segarra, that not all who wander are lost. She has a voice rooted in history, making music to change the present. Hers is the voice of the future."
Queer.
Segarra said, "I really like to make our image as a very queer band. Yosi the band's transgender fiddle player identifies as queer. So do I, as a longtime ally of queer causes."
As a young punk rock kid, "I loved the energy of the shows and listened to a lot of Kathleen Hannah of Bikini Kill," Segarra said. "She made me love women before I understood I did too."
On when she knew she could/would play music for a living: "I'd say it must have been our first time playing Idapalooza in Tennessee around the summer of 2007, probably, which is a queer festival in the woods, that I saw all these people dancing, singing and just loving the music. It was the best response we had ever had at the time. We had just put out a little demo on photocopied paper and only had a handful of songs. But people loved those songs, and I felt how much they meant to them. I realized that I had the ability to write songs that made people feel connected, feel good and sometimes make them cry. That ability is something I really treasure and take seriously. There's no better feeling than bringing people together. After that show I knew I wanted to do this for a living, and I probably will do it even if I don't make one too."
On the crossing music and community borders: "You don't see a Puerto Rican girl play the banjo in a honky-tonk very often! You don't see a transgendered drummer/fiddle player very often! It's awesome. I think it's powerful that we'll play songs with the Tumblweeds and show publicly that we accept and love each other as musicians and people. I hope that kind of acceptance and respect is contagious."
Musical career.
After two self-released albums, 2008's "It Don't Mean I Don't Love You" and 2010's "Young Blood Blues," Hurray for the Riff Raff released a self-titled CD composed of Segarra's favorite songs from those records on Loose Music in Europe on March 21, 2011. Tracks from the band's debut release received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music.
In February 2011, the band were featured in an article in "The Times", based around the HBO TV series, "Treme", with their track "Daniella" being listed in their selection of New Orleans' essential songs.
In May 2012, Hurray for the Riff Raff released "Look Out Mama" on their own label, Born to Win Records. "No Depression" said "Look Out Mama," "Sounds like something The Band would’ve had playing on a Victrola while making "Music From Big Pink" in Woodstock." "The best part of punk rock is remembering that you should be yourself,” Segarra says. “That’s what Look Out Mama was about—like ‘Let’s put all of our influences in there,’ which I’ve tried to do as a songwriter this time as well. I don’t subscribe to what I should be writing because of the genre I’m part of. It’s more that I’m not throwing out any part of my background or personality.”
Loose Music released "Look Out Mama" in Europe on August 20, 2012. The album was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at The Bomb Shelter Studios and produced by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes). The record features “End of the Line,” a song about a house—a gathering place for Segarra and her friends in the New Orleans’ Holy Cross neighborhood. “It’s where endless songs were traded at campfires, and a whole group of New Orleans–based songwriters inspired each other and grew together,” Segarra says.
Hurray for the Riff Raff released a covers album called "My Dearest Darkest Neighbor" on July 1, 2013 through Mod Mobilian Records and This Is American Music. The album was previously available only as a Kickstarter reward and in limited local release and featured handmade covers. Tracks on the record include songs by Townes Van Zandt, Billie Holiday, Gillian Welch, Leadbelly, John Lennon, Lucinda Williams, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, and George Harrison—and features Segarra's interpretation of Gillian Welch's "Ruination Day."
"Wall Street Journal" describes Segarra's singing: "She has a subtle, expressive voice that she wraps around songs that draw on the sounds and styles of the American South, and her lyrics often takes unconventional tack on traditional subjects."
"Spin" previewed a video of their song, St. Roch Blues, which is a "tribute to the New Orleans neighborhood of St. Roch that's inspired by a horrifying series of murders that took place in the area in 2011."
In February 2014, Hurray for the Riff Raff had their major label debut, "Small Town Heroes," on ATO Records. The record features original songs written or co-written by Segarra, and features fiddler Yosi Perlstein, keyboard player Casey McAllister, and two members of the Deslondes: Sam Doores on guitar and Dan Cutler on bass.
Describing the Segarra's music, "NPR" says "Segarra's morning-after alto might be the least showy great voice to hit the national scene this year." The song "The Body Electric" is dedicated to Damini, the woman who was killed during a 2012 Delhi gang rape. Segarra says the song's title "refers to the Walt Whitman poem, 'I Sing the Body Electric,' which was all about every body is sacred. But it's also about the woman murdered on the public bus. They never released her name; but people called her Damini, which means lightning, because what happened to her sparked a revolution. It sparked anger in women in India, who felt like, this has happened for so long, and this has to be the last one. I wanted to have some kind of reference to electricity or lightning in the title. It all came together in that phrase."

Cobham Training Centre

The Cobham Training Centre is the training ground of Chelsea Football Club located in the village of Stoke d'Abernon near to the village of Cobham, Surrey. The Chelsea first team have trained at Stoke D'Abernon since 2005, but it was not officially opened until 2007.
History.
When Roman Abramovich purchased Chelsea FC in July 2003, the club's training facilities were identified as an important area for new investment. Chelsea had used the Harlington training ground since the 1970s, but it was owned by Imperial College, and its facilities were regarded as outdated in comparison to those of clubs such as Manchester United (Trafford Training Centre) and Arsenal (Arsenal Training Centre). Then-Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho regarded the move to a new, modern, training ground as "significant step forward" in the club's ambitions. Planning permission for a new state-of-the-art complex in Cobham was granted by Elmbridge Borough Council in 2004. Chelsea began training at Cobham in 2005, while construction was still ongoing, and the facility was officially unveiled in July 2007. In 2008, the final phase of the complex, an Academy and Community Pavilion for Chelsea's youth teams and "Football in the Community" department, was opened.
Facilities.
Costing a reported £20m, the training centre is on a 140 acre site and, like a campus, it houses all of the club's football activities, from the first team to the academy, reserve and women's teams. It features "the latest in training, rehabilitation, medical, pitch and media technology" and its facilities include 30 football pitches (three with undersoil heating and six to Premier League standard), an indoor artificial pitch, a media centre, a medical centre, gyms, cold immersion pools, a sauna, a steam room and a 56 ft HydroWorx hydrotherapy pool.
As a condition for receiving planning permission, none of the buildings in the complex were permitted to be taller than others in the surrounding area. Thus, approximately a third of the facility is underground; a moat was installed to reflect light into the basement rooms and to reduce energy usage. The main building also has a turf roof in order to help it blend into its surroundings and to improve air quality. Water from the surrounding area is collected in a reservoir for use on the pitch irrigation system.
Other uses.
Cobham has hosted the Surrey Positive Mental Awareness League, a football league for people with mental health problems. It also hosts the "Cobham Cup", a tournament for under-16 teams from around the world, including River Plate and Bayern Munich. In 2007, the Chinese Olympic football team trained at Cobham for two weeks in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Old Malvernians play their home matches at Cobham. The training facilities are also used by Cobham Rugby Football Club.

Milford (Camden, North Carolina)

Milford, also known as the Relfe-Grice-Sawyer House, is the oldest two-story brick home in North Carolina, United States.
Its 1746 construction date is carved on a brick on the interior face of the north chimney & was confirmed by dendrochronology test in the 1990s. The formal two-story brick gabled structure, two bays deep and three bays wide, has interior end chimneys terminating in molded caps.
The brickwork is of Flemish bond with glazed headers, featuring three-course stringers of Flemish bond between the first and second stories and at the base of the gables. The use of one-to-three common bond in the brick of the south gable represents the earliest known example of this type of bonding in North Carolina. The north gable probably corresponds, but the entire north side is now concealed by stucco. Tumbling of the brick occurs along the rakes of the south gable. Tumbled bricks are usually placed at right angles to the gable slope, and the vertical placement of these bricks is, according to Thomas Waterman in The Early Architecture of North Carolina, found in only one other structure, the Wallop house in Accomack County, Virginia.
The west facade formerly functioned as the principal front, but the main entrance is located now in the central bay of the east facade. The doorway as well as the windows of the first story are ornamented only by flat arches serving as lintels. The windows of the second story, set quite close to the cornice, are completely plain. The lintels are formed of rowlocks which originally surmounted the south gable windows are still visible, although the windows are now much smaller.
