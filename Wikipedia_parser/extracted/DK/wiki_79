Terengganu Inscription Stone

Terengganu Inscription Stone (; Jawi: باتو برسورت ترڠڬانو) is the oldest artifact with Jawi writing on it. The inscriptions, which are in Malay, believed to be written on 22 February 1303. The artifact proves that Islam reached Terengganu earlier than 1326 or 1386.
At the UNESCO International Advisory Committee meeting in Barbados on 13 July 2009, the 700-year-old inscribed stone was listed as an item eligible for world heritage recognition.
It was accidentally discovered near Sungai Tersat at Kuala Berang, Terengganu, Malaysia by an Arab trader named Sayid Husin bin Ghulam al-Bokhari in 1899 after a flash flood hit Kuala Berang. The inscription on the stone proclaims Islam as the state religion of Terengganu.
History.
The stone is said to have been discovered by Sayid Husin bin Ghulam al-Bokhari an Arab trader. Saiyed Husin al-Bokhari and a village headman lifted and placed the stone on a raft to be taken to Kuala Terengganu. When they reached Kuala Terengganu, the stone was presented to Sultan Zainal Abidin III and was later placed on Bukit Puteri.
In 1922, the Deputy British Adviser in Terengganu, Mr. HS Peterson asked a Japanese photographer, N.Suzuki to take some photographs of the inscription which were then shipped to CO Blegden to be read.
In 1923, the stone was loaned to the Museum of Singapore while the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur was being built, and once the construction was done, the stone tablet was returned to Kuala Lumpur from Singapore Raffles Museum.
On February 12, 1987, the State Government of Terengganu wrote to the Administration of the National Museum requesting permission of getting the Inscription Stone back to be exhibited in their State Museum. In 1991, the Cabinet approved the request and the Inscription Stone was returned to the State Government of Terengganu. It is now on display at the Terengganu State Museum.

The Worship of the Serpent

The Worship of the Serpent by John Bathurst Deane is an 1833 study of snake worship and specifically the mythical snake mentioned in the Book of Genesis who convinced Eve to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, leading to Eve convincing Adam to do the same.
Overview.
A number of Gnostic texts, some only discovered recently such as those from the Nag Hammadi Library expound on an idea of knowledge and how the serpent gave knowledge to man. Deane draws a number of conclusions and makes certain guesses regarding snake worship, not just confined to Europe, but indeed all over the world. Deane goes on in his title to list a number of associations to the serpent such as the dragon and the leviathan. So thorough (albeit outdated) is his research, that he has "traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from Babylonia, east and west, through Persia, Hindûstan, China, Mexico, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy, Illyricum, Thrace, Greece, Asia Minor, and Phœnicia." (Ch VIII)

NUTS 2 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland

Within the European Union, regions are arranged for statistical and revenue disbursing purposes using the NUTS structure. In Ireland, the regionalisation arrangements negotiated by the Government of Ireland in the context of Agenda 2000 resulted in the designation of the State into two regions for Eurostat and EU Structural Funds purposes. Following this designation, two new regions (and their associated Regional Assemblies) were established and came into effect in July 1999: Southern and Eastern NUTS-II Region and Border, Midland and Western NUTS-II Region.

<doc id="5975136" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5975136" title="Early history of Singapore">
Early history of Singapore

The early history of Singapore refers to the history of Singapore before 1819, when the British established a trading settlement on the island and set in motion the history of 'modern Singapore'. Prior to 1819, Singapore was known by several names in written records dating back as early as the 2nd century, which identified the island as a trade port of some importance. 
The island was controlled by different kingdoms in Southeast Asia including the Siamese, Javanese, and Sultanate of Malacca from the 14th century and the Sultanate of Johor from the 16th century.
Second century.
The first written records of Singapore date to the second century, when the island was identified as a trading post in several cartographic references. The Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy (90168) identified a place called Sabana in the area where Singapore lies and identified it as a "nominon emporion" or designated foreign trading port, as part of a chain of similar trading centres that linked Southeast Asia with India and the Mediterranean. 
A 3rd century Chinese written record described the island of Pu Luo Zhong (蒲羅中), probably a transliteration of the Malay "Pulau Ujong", "island at the end" (of the Malay peninsula).
Indian culture.
As part of the Sri Vijaya Empire, Singapore was invaded by the south Indian Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire in the 11th century.
The Sejarah Melayu ("Malay Annals") contains a tale of a prince of Srivijaya, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama), who landed on the island after surviving a shipwreck in the 13th century. On the island, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a lion. Believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means "Lion City" in Sanskrit. However, it is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though tigers continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However there is another opinion that the name is due to the resemblance of the map or the aerial view of Singapore Island to a face of a lion with a Mane.
There is record that in 1320, the Mongol sent a mission to obtain elephants from a place called Long Ya Men (龍牙門 or "Dragon's Tooth Strait"), which is believed to be Keppel Harbour. The Chinese traveller Dan Ma Xi, visiting the island around 1330, described a small Malay settlement called Dan Ma Xi (淡馬錫, from Malay "Tamasek") containing a number of Chinese residents. The island was apparently a heaven for pirates preying on passing ships. The Nagarakretagama, a Javanese epic poem written in 1689, also referred to a settlement on the island, which it called Temasek ("Sea Town or Sea Port").
Middle Ages.
Recent excavations in Fort Canning provide evidence that Singapore was a port of some importance in the 14th century, used for transactions between the Malays and Chinese.
Following the decline of Srivijaya power, Temasek was alternately claimed by the Majapahit and the Siamese. Its fortifications apparently allowed it to withstand at least one attempted Siamese invasion. Historians believe that during the 1390s, Parameswara, the last Srivijayan prince, fled to Temasek from Palembang after being deposed by the Majapahit Empire. While these are parallels between the mythical Sang Nila Utama and historical Parameswara, these should be seen as distinct.
Notwithstanding Sejarah Melayu legend, the "Singapura" name possibly dates to this period. Parameswara held the island for a number of years, until further attacks from either the Majapahit or the Ayutthaya kingdom in Siam forced him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Singapore became part of the Malacca empire, and once served as the fiefdom of the legendary laksamana (or admiral) Hang Tuah.
European contact.
During the 16th and early 17th century, it briefly regained some importance as a trading centre of the Sultanate of Johor. In 1613, Portuguese raiders burnt down the settlement at the mouth of Singapore River and the island sank into obscurity. It was not until 1819, when the Englishmen Sir Raffles established a British trading post on the island, that modern Singapore was founded.

<br>(6). South-East Regional Authority
<br>(7). South-West Regional Authority
<br>(8). Mid-West Regional Authority]]
Regional Authorities in Ireland were established by the "Local Government Act 1991" and came into existence in 1994. Under this Act, the Regional Authorities have two main functions: to promote the co-ordination of public service provision and to monitor the delivery of European Union Structural Fund assistance in the regions. The Regional Authorities have specific responsibility for:
Membership.
The members of the Regional Authorities are not directly elected, but nominated from among the elected members of the local authorities in the region. Each local authority has a certain number of seats on a Regional Authority, based loosely on the population of the local authority area. The size of the Regional Authorities varies from 21 members in the Mid-East region to 37 members in the Border region.
Structures.
To assist the Regional Authority in undertaking its functions, each has an Operational Committee and an EU Operational Committee. The Operational Committee is chaired by the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson) of the Regional Authority and is composed of senior management from the constituent local authorities and other relevant public sector agencies operating in the region. It helps prepare the work of the Regional Authority and assists and advises it on matters relating to its functions. Also, each Regional Authority has a designated city/county manager (chief executive of a local authority) from one of its local authorities to further enhance the linkages between the local authorities and the Regional Authority.
The EU Operational Committee has a similar, but broader, composition and assists the Regional Authority in matters relating to EU assistance and reviewing the implementation of various EU Operational Programmes in a region.
Each Regional Authority has a Director, assisted by a number of policy and administrative staff. They are NUTS III level.
Financing.
The financing of the activities of the Regional Authorities is largely borne by their constituent local authorities.
Proposed reforms.
On 16 October 2012, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government published a policy document entitled "Putting People First", describing itself as an "action plan for effective local government". Under the proposed changes the eight Regional Authorities and two Regional Assemblies would be replaced by three new Regional Assemblies.
The proposed new regions would be created as follows:

Charles Ledger

Charles Ledger (4 March 1818 – 19 May 1905) was an alpaca farmer and noted for his work in connection with quinine, a treatment for malaria.
Ledger belonged to a huguenot family that emigrated to England in the 18th century; he was born at London, the son of George Ledger, a mercantile broker, and his wife Charlotte, "née" Warren. After leaving school he went to Peru and in 1836 was a clerk in a British merchant's office at Lima. It was at Lima that Charles rescued a drowning native Manuel Incra Manami, who offered to become his servant. He became an expert in alpaca wool, and in 1842 began business as a dealer in South American products. In 1847 he was grazing sheep and cattle half-way between Tacna and La Paz, and in 1852 went to Sydney to inquire into the possibility of introducing the alpaca into Australia. He returned to South America and by 1859 had brought several hundred alpacas to Sydney. This was a hazardous and difficult business as the export of alpacas was forbidden. Ledger was paid £15,000 for his alpacas and given a position in charge of them. The attempt to acclimatize alpacas in Australia ended in failure, but Ledger was not at fault. 
Ledger, however, found a better variety for producing quinine, now known as "Cinchona ledgeriana", and in 1865 under great difficulties collected several pounds of seed and sent them to his brother George Ledger in London. For his share in this work Ledger's servant, Manuel, was arrested in Bolivia and so severely beaten that he died. The seed was sent to London where some of it was purchased by the Dutch government. Seeds were also sent to India and Queensland but the trees do not appear to have been grown in Australia. In 1883 Ledger went to Sydney again and in 1884 took a farm 20 miles (30 km) from Goulburn, New South Wales. 
Losing his savings in the bank failures of the early 1890s, efforts were made by Sir Clements Markham and others to obtain some provision for Ledger from the Indian and Dutch governments. Initially this was refused, but in 1897 on Ledger's 79th birthday, he received news that the Dutch government had granted him an annuity of £100 a year. He died eight years after in 1905.
Ledger did a great service to the world, as millions of cinchona trees grown in India and Java sprang originally from the seeds he collected. By 1900 two-thirds of the world's supply of quinine came from Java, and over 40 years later the Ledger types of cinchona were still the best quinine yielders.

William T. Owen

Lieutenant Colonel William Taylor Owen (27 May 1905 – 29 July 1942) was an Australian Army officer who served during the Second World War. A survivor of the Battle of Rabaul, he was killed in action leading the 39th Battalion during the Kokoda Track campaign.
Early life.
Owen was born in Nagambie, Victoria. He worked as a bank officer in civilian life and served as a militia officer in the years prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.
Military career.
Owen enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 8 July 1940, with the service number VX45223. He was posted to the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion, with the rank of major, in command of 'A' Company. 
Battle of Rabaul.
The 2/22nd Infantry Battalion was sent to the town of Rabaul, on the island of New Britain, in early 1941. This was the closest Australian base to the Japanese, and considered unlikely to be successfully defended. In late January 1942, the 1,400 strong Rabaul (Australian) garrison was quickly overwhelmed by the Japanese. Owen's 'A' Company was positioned at Vulcan beach, and bore the brunt of the main Japanese landing. After fighting for several hours, Owen ordered his men to break contact, as they would otherwise have been cut off.
With the remainder of the Australian garrison, Owen and his men escaped from Rabaul. They faced a harrowing battle for survival in the mountains and along the southern coast. More than 150 men were massacred after being taken prisoner around Tol and Waitavalo plantations, up to 100 others died of illnesses, and about 800 surrendered and were taken back to Rabaul by the Japanese. Owen was one of only 400 to get off New Britain. He arrived in Port Moresby and after a period of recuperation in Australia was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 39th Battalion on 7 July 1942.
Kokoda Track Campaign.
The 39th Battalion was preparing for deployment to the mountain village of Kokoda, as the first step in an Allied plan to occupy the north coast of Papua. The first troops departed the day after Owen assumed command. After the Japanese landed on the north coast on 21 July, Owen was flown up to Kokoda, from where 'B' Company was already engaging the enemy. Facing overwhelming odds, the Australians were pushed back. Owen ordered the burning of the supply dump at Kokoda and a retreat to Deniki. After realising the Japanese had not occupied Kokoda, he led his men back into the village in an attempt to reopen its airfield to receive reinforcements and supplies. The aircraft dispatched to Kokoda were not able to land. The Japanese started attacking in force on the evening of 28 July.
Owen was mortally wounded at 0300 hrs on the morning of 29 July 1942, as the Japanese stepped up their attacks on the dug-in Australians. He was shot just above the right eye while in his forward weapon pit. Taken back to a hut that was being used as an aid post, he was examined by the medical officer, Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon. His situation was deemed hopeless and when the Australians were forced to withdraw from their location at 0430 hrs, Owen could not be moved. He was cleaned up and left as comfortable as possible. The hut was shortly overrun by Japanese troops, and Owen is believed to have died in captivity shortly afterwards. 
On 9 August, Owen's body was found and buried at Kokoda by members of 'A' Company, 39th Battalion, when they retook Kokoda for a short period between 8 and 10 August 1942. His body was later re-interred at Bomana War Cemetery, north-west of Port Moresby, following the Japanese withdrawal from the Kokoda Trail. He posthumously received the United States Distinguished Service Cross and was Mentioned in Despatches.

He became affiliated with the centrist UCR in 1983, and subsequently directed the National Register of Secured Credit, was Vice President of the Forensic Fund of Río Negro, and President of the SanCor co-operative's insurance division. He was elected Councilman in General Roca in 1989, and mayor of the city in 1991; he wasre-elected in 1995 and served in the post until 1999. He became a provincial deputy that year and was president of the Río Negro chapter of the UCR-led Alliance (in power nationally between 1999 and 2001).
Saiz was elected governor of the province in 2003, defeating Carlos Soria. He became a leading supporter within UCR ranks of the left-wing Peronist President Néstor Kirchner, and helped form the "K Radicals" caucus (UCR supporters of Kirchner). 
Saiz ran for re-election against Justicialist Party politician Miguel Ángel Pichetto in the 2007 gubernatorial race. President Kirchner considered backing Saiz at the expense of his own party, though ultimately opted to play no role in the provincial election. Saiz won re-election over Pichetto by around 5% with the support of various leftist parties, and his membership in the UCR was subsequently suspended by the party committee.

External degree

An external degree is a degree offered by a university to students who have not been required to be physically present within the geographic territory of the institution. These undergraduates may be called "external students" and may study at classes unconnected with the university, or independently, or by distance learning. They may obtain the degree by passing examinations once they have reached the required standard, or by having successfully completed a programme put together from various courses or modules.
In 1858 the University of London became the first English university to offer external degrees, holding exams open to people in other cities, or to London students who had attended evening classes. In various UK towns university colleges were established, where students could study towards a London external degree. The colleges were among the "approved centres" for London's exams. Soon centres overseas were approved, starting with one in Mauritius in 1865.

Ethnic bioweapon

An ethnic bioweapon ("biogenetic weapon") aims to harm only or primarily persons of specific ethnicities or genotypes.
History of ethnic bioweapons.
Usage of natural disease as a weapon in conflicts has a long history. In Nepal, its rulers maintained a malaria-infected Terai forest as natural barrier against invaders from the Ganges plains. Natives of Terai have natural resistance to malaria, while the invaders didn't.
One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in Robert A. Heinlein's 1942 novel "Sixth Column" (republished as "The Day After Tomorrow") in which a race-specific radiation weapon is used against a so-called "Pan-Asian" invader.
Genetic weapons.
In 1997, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen referred to the concept as a possible risk. In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a "genetic weapon" a plausible possibility, and believed the former Soviet Union had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.
The possibility of a "genetic bomb" is presented in Vincent Sarich's and Frank Miele's book, "", published in 2004. The authors believe that information from the Human Genome Project will be used in just such a manner.
In 2004, The Guardian reported that the British Medical Association (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as "treatment to Alzheimer's and other debilitating diseases" could also be used for malign purposes.:
In 2005 the official view of the International Committee of the Red Cross was "The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts."
In 2012, The Atlantic wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the President of the United States. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence.
Israeli "ethno-bomb" controversy.
In November 1998, "The Sunday Times" reported that Israel was attempting to build an "ethno-bomb" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations. "Wired News" also reported the story, as did "Foreign Report". 
The article was quickly denounced as a hoax. Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent. The "New York Post", describing the claims as "blood libel", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic Doron Stanitsky. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as "wholly fantastical", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible. 
A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and no sources were ever identified. Neither of the authors of the "Sunday Times" story, Uzi Mahnaimi and Marie Colvin, have spoken publicly on the matter.
Russian ban on export of biological samples.
In May 2007, Russian newspaper "Kommersant" reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples.
The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret FSB report about on-going development of "genetic bioweapons" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the Harvard School of Public Health, American International Health Alliance, United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division, Karolinska Institutet and United States Agency for International Development.

Madagascar (1994 film)

Madagascar (1994) is a Cuban film that marked Fernando Pérez's change of direction into a more lyrical approach to filmmaking, somehow stripped from the realistic documentary feel of his early work. The film chronicles the relationship and lack of communication between a mother and daughter during the Cuban economic crisis known as the Special Period.
Background and Plot Synopsis.
"Madagascar" was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy to be entitled 'Pronóstico del tiempo' ("Weather Prediction"). The production and post-production of director Fernando Pérez’s third fiction film was completed in September 1993 to await the preparation of the work’s other two parts: 'Melodrama' ("Melodrama," dir. Rolando Díaz) and 'Quiéreme y verás' ("Love me and you’ll see," dir. Daniel Díaz Torres). The three directors had worked together to develop their ideas for the creation of the project, but in the end, according to Pérez, the films wound up lacking the necessary continuity necessary to bind them together. Partly as a result of such concerns over their contents, and partly in response to the delays produced by an ongoing shortage of production funds for Díaz's and Díaz Torres' works, each wound up being released independently. During December 1994, over one year after the completion of its post-production, Madagascar first appeared in Cuba’s theatres as part of the annual New Latin American Film Festival held in Havana.
"Madagascar" was inspired by the 1984 Mirta Yáñez short story "Beatles contra Duran Duran" ("Beatles Against Duran Duran"). The story chronicles the relationship between the narrator, who is a single mother and pragmatic middle-aged professor of physics, and her moody adolescent daughter. The plot of the film draws loosely from the original text, which Pérez appears to have used as a point of departure and a rough character sketch as he worked closely with cinematographer Raúl Pérez Ureta and screenwriter Manuel Antonio Rodríguez during the developmental stages of the project. Laura (played by Zaida Castellanos) and Laurita (played by Laura de la Uz) are the central characters of the film and bear an obvious resemblance to the unnamed narrator of the short story and her daughter, Pilar. However, the film’s mode of expression as well as its plot both diverge greatly from that of the story.
The main characters' opposing personalities form the focal points of the film’s narrative, which becomes a sort of psychological travelogue. During the opening sequence, we learn that Laura’s life has entered into a mysterious psychological crisis, exacerbated by her daughter’s extreme behavior. In an opening monologue, she tells us that she has lost the ability to dream anything different from what she experiences in her daily life. This monologue, and ostensibly the rest of Laura’s ongoing voice-over narration, occurs in the context of a consultation with an unseen doctor. From then on, the plot focuses around Laura’s internal conflicts and her relationship with her daughter. In an early scene, Laurita informs her mother that she has grown tired of school and will be taking a break from her studies in order to travel to Madagascar. In response, Laura becomes furious and criticizes Laurita for indulging in such frivolous fantasies. Increasingly disaffected, Laurita proceeds to undergo a series of personality transformations. This disturbs Laura, who is frustrated with the stagnant conditions of her own life, but cannot make such sudden changes.
Laura and Laurita live together with Laura’s elderly mother (Elena Bolaños), and are accompanied by a reticent young painter known only as Molina (Jorge Molina) who appears to have befriended Laurita. Throughout the film, the family moves often, changing homes four times. The film has the episodic quality of a road movie as much of the exposition thus takes place in the midst of the family’s relocations. The climax occurs when, following a particularly difficult argument with her mother, Laurita decides to run away from home. She returns after a few days, but the experience has altered both her and her mother. In the final scene, the two have practically traded personalities, and it is Laura who tells her daughter, "nos vamos de viaje para Madagascar" ("we’re going to travel to Madagascar").
The creators of the film bore the circumstances of its production admirably well. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, ICAIC had imported all of its film and development chemicals from the USSR and its economic allies. The lack of chemicals on the island after 1991 forced "Madagascar"’s production unit to mail all of their negatives to a lab in Venezuela, making "dailies," or the practice of reviewing each day’s shooting and then re-filming whatever did not turn out as planned, impossible. Despite being forced to "shoot blind," as it were, Pérez maintains that he and his crew did not lack any truly fundamental supplies (besides gasoline, which was in scarce supply throughout the island by mid-1993). Nevertheless, the director did believe at the time that it would be his last film and such conditions may have played a significant role in the development of the film’s style and plot.
To date, "Madagascar" and the other pieces intended to make up "Pronóstico del tiempo" remain some of the last films to receive all of their production funds exclusively from el Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC, the "Cuban Institute for the Film Art and Industry"). During the early 1990s, the Cuban economy had fallen on hard times and ICAIC’s budget suffered accordingly. By 1995, the small, semi-autonomous, national industry that had been producing independent works since 1959 had to restructure itself to meet the demands of the international market. Co-productions with outside organizations, intended for release in foreign markets became the only available means of survival.

Bumpass, Virginia

Bumpass is an unincorporated community located primarily in Louisa County, Virginia, United States, but covering a small portion of both Spotsylvania and Hanover Counties as well. It has received moderate fame for its unusual name. Named for the Bumpass family (from the French "Bon Pas" meaning "good step") who lived in the area when it was named. It is known for its many farms, defunct ice cream spoon factory, alpaca ranches, and lumbering operations. It contains most of Lake Anna and several houses and estates from the 18th to early 20th centuries, including Jerdone Castle, a plantation (now lakefront) dating to 1742 that is a Virginia Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historical Places. Also listed is the Duke House. In addition, Bumpass is the home of "Argonaut BioFuels", one of the largest biomass-to-energy facilities in the country currently under construction. Alternate names associated with the locality include Bumpas, Bumpass Junction, Bumpass Station, Bumpass Turnout, Jackson District, Northern District, and Second Turnout. 
Demographics.
Population (2000): 6,351. Population density, 58 people per square mile with 3,190 males (50.2%) and females 3,161 (49.8%.) White population: 5,526, Black population: 712, American Indian population: 35, Asian population: 17, Some other race population: 7. 100% Rural Population. Population density: 61 people per square mile. Median household income (1999): $43,625. Estimated median house/condo value in 2005: $184,422.
History.
Bumpass is named for Captain John Thomas Bumpass Sr. (1822–1884). "Capt. Tom" was the son of Jack Bumpass (first with this name to settle in the area). He was a captain of the Virginia State Militia who during the Civil War provided fuel and water for troop trains along the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad (then Louisa Railroad). The site of the old Bumpass farm marks the point where the Bumpass community was first sprung from a small hamlet situated along a turnout. Suiting to its original namesake of 2nd Turnout renamed Bumpass' Turnout or later to be known as simply Bumpass. Over the years the area began to expand and grow from one hamlet to a variable of localities such as Buckner and Locust Creek. Like other peculiar named place Bumpass has gathered a moderate reputation for unusualness. It has frequently been the site of a multiple things that are either simply just curious or which are picturesque of such a remote sort of area. Such is the case of the Grasberger Ice Cream Spoon Factory which specialized in the manufacturing of ice cream spoons, paper ice cream plates, and pickle/cocktail forks. It shut down in the 1920s, but in 2001 some of Goochland County's "Field Day of the Past" volunteers salvaged much of the Grasberger's old equipment and transported it from Louisa County to Goochland County. There it remains an important part of an exhibit on late 19th century machinery. The nostalgic phrase “George Washington slept here” (a frequent claim to fame by many varying small communities) also applies to this area. As on the night of June 10, 1791, the former President made an overnight visit to Jerdone Castle, located in Bumpass.

Stray (band)

Stray are a British band, formed in 1966. The vocalist Steve Gadd (born 27 April 1952, Shepherd's Bush, London), guitarist Del Bromham (born Derek Roy Bromham, 25 November 1951, Acton, London), bass player Gary Giles (born Gary Stephen Giles, 23 February 1952, North Kensington, London) and drummer Steve Crutchley (born c 1952) formed the band, whilst all were attending the Christopher Wren School in London. Richard "Ritchie" Cole (born 10 November 1951, Shepherd's Bush, London) replaced Crutchley in 1968. They signed to Transatlantic Records in January 1970.
The group's brand of melodic, hook-laden hard rock proved to be a popular draw on the local club scene during the early 1970s. However the band did not have commercial success with its record releases. At one stage Charlie Kray (brother of the Kray twins Ronnie and Reggie), was their manager. Gadd left the band in 1975 due to artistic differences and was replaced on vocals by Pete Dyer.
The original Stray finally dissolved in 1977, although Bromham later continued to play in various resurrected versions of the project well into the 2000s.
There are two Iron Maiden connections to Stray. "All in Your Mind" from Stray's 1970 debut album was covered by Iron Maiden, and Maiden bassist Steve Harris's daughter Lauren has covered "Come On Over".
From late 2006 until early 2007, the band's back catalogue of eight studio albums issued originally during the 1970s, were re-released by the UK based Sanctuary Records in compact disc format. The new releases were remastered and had bonus tracks culled from single B-sides, studio outtakes and BBC broadcast sessions.

Araripe manakin

The Araripe manakin ("Antilophia bokermanni") is a critically endangered bird from the family of manakins ("Pipridae"). It was discovered in 1996 and scientifically described in 1998. The species epithet commemorates Brazilian zoologist and wildlife filmmaker Werner Bokermann, who died in 1995. Because of its helmet-like crown it has received the Portuguese name "soldadinho-do-araripe" which means ""little soldier of Araripe"". This name also associates it with the related, but more widespread, helmeted manakin ("Antilophia galeata"), which is known simply as the "soldadinho".
Description.
As typical of most manakins, males and females have a strong sexual dimorphism in the colors of the plumage. As in the helmeted manakin, it is a relatively large and long-tailed manakin, with a total length of c. 14.5 centimetres. The strikingly patterned males have a predominantly white plumage. With the exception of the white wing coverts, the wings are black as the tail. From the frontal tuft, over the crown, down to the middle back runs a carmine red patch. The iris is red. The females are mainly olive green and have pale green upperparts. They have a reduced olive green frontal tuft.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to the Chapada do Araripe (Araripe uplands) in the Brazilian state of Ceará in the north eastern region of the country. It is only fifty kilometres long and one kilometre wide and the typical habitat apparently is a consequence of the soils formed from the Early Cretaceous Santana Formation limestone. The pure breeding range has a size of only 1 km² and lays in a theme park. It is likely to be more widespread than presently known, although surveys in nearby Balneario das Caldas failed to locate any individuals.
Threats.
In 2000 there was an estimated population of less than 50 individuals and it was considered as one of the rarest birds in Brazil and in the world. Only three males and one female were found until that date. In 2003 the estimations were more optimistic and BirdLife International assumed the population of 49 to 250 individuals. In 2004 it proceeded on the assumption that less than 250 individuals exist in the wild which was based on 43 discovered males. Unfortunately in 2000 a theme park with swimming pools and asphalted roads was built at the type locality Nascente do Farias and the largest part of its original habitat became destroyed. The cleared trees were replaced by banana plantations.
At the BirdLife International celebrity lecture held in Peterborough on 16 August 2008, it was announced that Sir David Attenborough would be championing the Araripe manakin in an effort to raise funds to help protect this rare bird. There are approximately 500 pairs of the Araripe manakin left. Sir David was presented with a picture of the manakin following his lecture, which was on Alfred Russel Wallace and Birds of Paradise. More information and a picture of the Araripe manakin can be found on the BirdLife website.

Slobodan Šijan (Serbian Cyrillic: Слободан Шијан, ) (born November 16, 1946, Belgrade, Yugoslavia) is a Serbian film director.
After graduating film direction and directing a handful of TV movies in the late 1970s, he caught a big break with his first full-length feature "Ko to tamo peva" in 1980. The enormous success of that film written by Dušan Kovačević led to the duo collaborating on another project - 1982's "Maratonci trče počasni krug", which also achieved considerable critical and commercial success.
Over the coming years Šijan directed two more notable films - "Kako sam sistematski uništen od idiota" and "Davitelj protiv davitelja".
As of 2001, he is teaching at Loyola Marymount University film school.
His favorite movie is Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo" (1959).

Clwyd South (Assembly constituency)

Clwyd South is a constituency of the National Assembly for Wales. It elects one Assembly Member by the first past the post method of election. Also, however, it is one of nine constituencies in the North Wales electoral region, which elects four additional members, in addition to nine constituency members, to produce a degree of proportional representation for the region as a whole.
Boundaries.
The constituency was created for the first election to the Assembly, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the Clwyd South Westminster constituency. It is mostly within the preserved county of Clwyd and partly within the preserved county of Powys.
For the 2007 Assembly election, however, it became a constituency entirely within Clwyd. Part of its area was transferred to the Montgomeryshire constituency, in Powys. Also, part of its area wastransferred to another Clwyd constituency, Clwyd West. For Westminster purposes, the same boundary changes will become effective at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.
As created in 1999, the North Wales region includes the constituencies of Alyn and Deeside, Caernarfon, Clwyd West, Clwyd South, Conwy, Delyn, Vale of Clwyd, Wrexham and Ynys Môn. For the 2007 election the region will include Aberconwy, Alyn and Deeside, Arfon, Clwyd South, Clwyd West, Delyn, Vale of Clwyd, Wrexham and Ynys Môn.
For the period 1999 to 2007, the Clwyd South constituency can be described as constisting of electoral divisions as follows:
Voting.
In general elections for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional closed party list of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the d'Hondt method, with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

Armistice of Villa Giusti

The Armistice of Villa Giusti ended warfare between Italy and Austria-Hungary on the Italian Front during World War I. The armistice was signed on November 3, 1918 in the Villa Giusti and was to take effect 24 hours later.
Background.
By the end of October 1918, while its definitive defeat was being perpetrated at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the Austro-Hungarian Army found itself in such a state that its commanders were forced to seek a ceasefire at any cost.
During the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the troops of Austria-Hungary were defeated, ceasing to exist as a combat force and starting a chaotic withdrawal. From 28 October onwards, Austria-Hungary sought to negotiate a truce but hesitated to sign the text of armistice. The Italians, in the meantime, advanced reaching Trento, Udine, and landing in Trieste. After the threat to break off the negotiations, on November 3 the Austro-Hungarians accepted the peace terms. The cease-fire would be started at 3.00 pm of November 4, but due to a unilateral order of the Austro-Hungarian high command, the empire's forces stopped fighting on November 3. After the war, the Kingdom of Italy annexed the Southern Tyrol (modern Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol), according to London Pact terms as well as Trieste and the Austrian Littoral.

Junnosuke Yoshiyuki

Life.
Yoshiyuki was born in Okayama, the oldest child of author Yoshiyuki Eisuke, but his family moved to Tokyo when he was 3. He attended Shizuoka High School, where he grew interested in Thomas Mann's stories, and in 1945 entered the University of Tokyo. He left the university without a degree and began working full-time as an editor at a weekly scandal magazine, while spending much of his leisure time gambling, drinking, and frequenting prostitutes. Sexuality and prostitution would form a consistent theme in his writing.
Works and Awards.
Yoshiyuki's first published fiction was "Bara Hanbainin" (薔薇販売人, The Rose Seller, 1950), followed by the novels "Genshoku no Machi" (The City of Primary Colors, 1951, revised 1956), "Shu-u" (驟雨, Sudden Shower, 1954), for which he won the Akutagawa Prize, and "Shofu no Heya" (Room of a Whore, 1958). His novel "Anshitsu" (暗室, The Dark Room, 1969) won the Tanizaki Prize. Another of his most celebrated works, "Yugure Made" (夕暮れまで, 1978, published in English translation as 'Toward Dusk and Other Stories' by Kurodahan Press, 2011), took 13 years to write but once published quickly became a best-seller and won the Noma Literary Prize.

The Colgate Comedy Hour

The Colgate Comedy Hour is an American comedy-musical variety series that aired live on the NBC network from 1950 to 1955. The show featured many notable comedians and entertainers of the era as guest stars.
Synopsis.
The program evolved from NBC's first TV variety showcase, "Four Star Revue," sponsored by Motorola. The "running gag" sketches were dropped in favor of more performing acts. The weekly show was proposed to be hosted by four comedians in a four-week rotation to provide competition for Ed Sullivan's "Toast of the Town" on CBS. The first episode, starring Hans Conreid, Rosemary DeCamp and Dick Foran, was written and produced by the then 22-year old Peggy Webber, who appeared in over 100 episodes of "Dragnet" with Jack Webb., 
The new format was heavily backed by its sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, to the tune of $3 million in the first year, and the 8:00 p.m. ET, Sunday evening format show was a spectacular success, particularly for Eddie Cantor and the Martin & Lewis and Abbott & Costello duos. In his autobiography, Jerry Lewis wrote that the show premiered Sunday, September 17, 1950, with Martin & Lewis and was telecast from the Park Theatre off Columbus Circle in New York City. As theatres are known by different names over history, it is possible that this was the now-demolished International Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle, the broadcast location of another NBC show of the era, "Your Show of Shows" with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. In fact, Eddie Cantor hosted the first Colgate Hour on September 10, 1950. 
During the 1950-51 season, AT&T put into regular service a coast-to-coast coaxial/microwave interconnection service which allowed live telecasts from across the nation. Three production units were quickly set up, one in New York, one in Chicago, and one in Los Angeles. Martin & Lewis and Abbott & Costello anchored the West Coast, broadcasting from the El Capitan theater in Hollywood (today known as Avalon Hollywood. Other shows that originated here include The Hollywood Palace), while Eddie Cantor anchored from New York. This gave NBC a substantial edge over Ed Sullivan, since top-grade talent from motion pictures could also do network TV on the West Coast "Colgate Comedy Hour," while Sullivan had to work with whomever happened to be in New York at the time that a particular episode aired.
During the 1952-53 season, Cantor suffered a heart attack immediately after a "Colgate Comedy Hour" show in September. Although he quickly recovered and returned in January 1953, he was reluctant to move with the show. By the fourth season, the sponsor was providing $6 million, but the performers were finding difficulty in offering fresh material and ratings began to decline. Cantor had become too ill to continue in the hosting role, and the travel was too stressful and painful for him. His final "Colgate" appearance was in May 1954. Vic Schoen was hired as the musical director in 1954.
In 1954, Tony Martinez, later cast as the farmhand on "The Real McCoys", made his television debut on "The Colgate Comedy Hour."
In June 1955, the show changed its name to the "Colgate Variety Hour" to reflect a move away from pure comedy. A number of the earlier hosts had left by the end of the 1953-54 season (with the exception of Martin & Lewis) as the show shifted toward mini-musicals, starring hosts such as Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra, who paired together in truncated version of Cole Porter's "Anything Goes". The show was also performing on the road as well, unlike other seasons where the shows were transmitted from New York or Los Angeles at 8 p.m. Gordon MacRae often served as host during this period.
However, ratings continued to slide while "The Ed Sullivan Show" got stronger. The final show, emceed by the series' last continuing host Robert Paige, aired as a Christmas special on December 25, 1955, with Fred Waring and his "Pennsylvanians" choral ensemble. The "Colgate Comedy Hour" was replaced the following season with the "NBC Comedy Hour," hosted by Leo Durocher for the first three shows. After Durocher, the regular hosts changed, and after 18 broadcasts, the final show aired in June. Regular supporting casts always co-starred in each of the episodes. Jonathan Winters was featured on the show.
On November 5, 1967, NBC broadcast a special "Colgate Comedy Hour" revival (pre-empting "The Dean Martin Show", which Colgate sponsored at the time), with guests Nanette Fabray, Kaye Ballard, Edie Adams, Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks one of their "2000 Year Old Man" routines, Phyllis Diller, Bob Newhart, Nipsey Russell, and Dan Rowan & Dick Martin. None of the performers who had performed in the original 1950-1956 shows appeared. The special also served as a television pilot for a possible revival of the series, which never happened.
In the 1954-1955 season, Donald O'Connor left the show and starred in his own musical situation comedy, "The Donald O'Connor Show", which aired on the NBC Saturday schedule alternating with "The Jimmy Durante Show".
Notable guest stars who went on to find success in entertainment included Vera Miles, costar of Alfred Hitchcock's thriller "Psycho", Bob Fosse, later a noted choreographer and director who won multiple Tonys and an Academy Award for his work, and even a child-age Christopher Walken, who became an Oscar-winning actor and screen star, appeared alongside Jerry Lewis in a sketch (albeit under his given name, Ronald).
Kinescopes of the 28 shows hosted by Martin & Lewis have been airing Saturday evenings on the classic television network RTV since June 30, 2012.
Color.
The episode broadcast on November 22, 1953, hosted by Donald O'Connor, was the very first ever color television broadcast in the NTSC color system (used in the U.S. until the change to digital in June 2009). There were few other color broadcasts in the 1953-1954 season, and all of them were transmitted by NBC. The series was also used earlier in the season to demonstrate the final form of RCA's "Compatible" color system to members of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Two sets were in the room: an experimental color model and a standard black-and-white unit. Eddie Cantor hosted the program with guests including Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher, and Brian Donlevy.

John Anderson (racing driver)

John Anderson (born April 20, 1944 (Warren, Michigan), died August 5, 1986 (Charlotte, North Carolina)) was an American stock car racing driver. He drove in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series between 1979 and 1983, posting a best finish of fifth.
Career.
Born April 20, 1944 in Warren, Michigan, Anderson first drove in racing competition at Flat Rock Speedway in 1965, winning the Michigan Figure 8 racing championship in 1967. He was the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) Rookie-of-the-Year in 1968.
During the late 1960s and 1970s Anderson was successful in competition, winning a number of track championships, along with several ARCA and American Speed Association races. He moved up to United States Auto Club (USAC) sprint car and midget car racing in 1977, and ran his first NASCAR race, in the modified series, at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the fall of that year, winning the pole for the event.
In 1979 he made his first NASCAR Winston Cup Series start, scoring a fifth-place finish in his first race, at Michigan International Speedway. He ran the majority of the 1980 season for a number of teams, scoring two top-10 finishes; towards the end of the year he was hired by John Rebham to drive for his team; in 1981, driving an Oldsmobile, he was involved in a spectacular accident during the UNO Twin 125 qualifying races for the Daytona 500. Shortly afterwards Rebham, impatient for results and under pressure from his sponsors, fired Anderson, replacing him with Donnie Allison. Anderson would only run a few additional races in the Winston Cup Series and Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series before retiring.
Anderson won over 200 races of various types during his racing career. He was killed in a road accident on Interstate 85 near Charlotte, North Carolina on August 5, 1986, being survived by his wife Mary Ann and two children.
Anderson was inducted into the Michigan Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.

W.E. Hill &amp; Sons

W. E. Hill & Sons (1887–1992) was a London-based firm that specialized in violins and other string instruments, and bows. It was also known as William Hill & Sons or William E. Hill & Sons.
Founded by William Ebsworth Hill at 38 New Bond Street, London in 1887, the name W. E. Hill & Sons built on a long family history of violin making going back to William Ebsworth's great grandfather, Joseph Hill. The firm soon gained a widespread reputation for excellence in repairs, making of instruments, bows, cases and fittings as well as instrument identification and authentication. A "Hill's" Certificate of Authenticity was considered definitive worldwide throughout the firm's history.
Many fine craftsmen worked for the firm. They were particularly famous for their bow makers. For much of the 20th century, the Hill workshop employed England’s best bow makers, who created bows renowned for character and consistency. Hill violins, cellos and cases are also highly regarded. Their other famous products included varnish cleaner, violin e-strings, and books about violin-making families.
Many famous stringed instruments passed through Hill & Sons, including the Alard Stradivarius, the Messiah Stradivarius, and the Lipinski Stradivarius.
W. E. Hill and Sons ceased operation in 1992.

Stately Wayne Manor

Stately Wayne Manor is a writer/musician/performer, perhaps best known globally for his participation in professional wrestling. Having thrice been touted as "The World's Most Conceited Man’" in "The Weekly World News" and "The Sun", it’s no surprise that the letters in Stately's tribute site URL, SWMSWM.com, stand for Stately Wayne Manor's Site to Worship Me.
The "fledging rock star" years.
Dubbed a virtuoso rock drummer by a Philadelphia-area newspaper, self-taught Manor also became competent enough at songwriting, synthesizer, various percussion instruments, harmonica, vocals and electric bass to perform each discipline onstage; and wrote three articles for "Modern Drummer" magazine. He also performed in a public demonstration with synthesizer inventor Dr. Robert Moog.
Stately is one of the "Sigma Kids," a group of about a dozen David Bowie devotees who kept a ten-day vigil outside the studio and band’s hotel during the recording of "Young Americans" rewarded afterwards with an exclusive listening party hosted by Bowie, a move so unprecedented, it was documented in "Rolling Stone" magazine. In 2007, a special CD/DVD re-release of the album features Manor visible in four photos in the enclosed booklet. Photos from the event also appear in books about Bowie and the original supermodel, Gia, as well as on the SWM website ‘Photos’ archive. The May 2014 issue of Britain's "Mojo" magazine, in an article chronicling the "YA" sessions, contained two photos from said booklet, including a never-before-released color version of one, it capturing Stately in the foreground.
Inspired by the Sigma experience to try his own hand as front man, Manor assembled a short-lived band, recruiting bassist Gail Ann Dorsey who, ironically enough, now regularly tours with Bowie.
In the latter half of the Seventies, Stately became deeply immersed in the emerging punk rock music scene. He was a regular and occasional performer at Philadelphia’s Hot Club, and frequented NYC venues such as CBGB and Max’s Kansas City, regularly sleeping on the couch of future recording-engineer superstar Bob Clearmountain while in New York. Manor was also slated to drum behind former Sex Pistol Sid Vicious on the Philly date of the latter’s aborted "solo tour." Additionally, he wrote the liner notes for the aborted Cheetah Chrome debut solo album on Polish Records. (Stately "did" receive a 'Thank You' on that label's release "Siren" by Ronnie Spector.)
The professional wrestling years.
Fueled by the advent and aggression of punk rock and his interests in performing—he made his public debut at age five—but disillusioned with the music business, Manor regained interest in a childhood hobby, professional wrestling, and was particularly drawn towards the ‘‘heel’’ (‘bad guy’) characters.
Never content to merely observe, but lacking the bulk required to participate in matches, Manor eventually broke into the bonebending business as a feature writer in 1984 and, in 1986, as a pro-heel columnist for "Wrestling World" magazine, his highly provocative "Stately States" inspiring hate mail from around the globe. Having established himself as The Sultan Of Insultin’ for his blistering attacks on the mat heroes and those who support them, Manor expanded into color commentating, managing grapplers, performing in-ring skits and ghostwriting wisecracks for the performers. Though not publicly accredited, a number of Manor’s column scenarios and zingers have been ‘re-originated’ in the WWE, TNA and WCW.
Manor was the very first color commentator for the ECW promotion (in their pre-Extreme days), though he has nothing positive to say about what they later became. He is also believed to be the first American magazine writer to give international exposure to Sabu, Rey Misterio, Sean Waltman, John Cena, Sandman and Victoria/Tara (Lisa Varon); and in the early Nineties, long before the Texan joined the WWF and become known as Stone Cold, Stately publicly proclaimed, "If I could buy stock in any (active) wrestler, it would be Steve Austin."
On the independent circuit, Manor has written and performed skits with WWE Hall Of Famers Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Snuka, once enraging a Northern audience by publicly apologizing for the Civil War to Memphis-native Lawler(!) By bizarre coincidence, Manor was at one point also scheduled to perform with the "pro wrestler" named Sid Vicious.
During 1993, in the midst of his 17-year tenure with "Wrestling World’", Manor debuted a second villain-praising column, that one in Britain's "Power Slam". It too provoked a great deal of controversy among readers. With the uninterrupted streak of pieces in "WW" and "PS," he is the longest-running active columnist in professional wrestling.
Other media sightings.
print.
When not denigrating shirtless mammoths, Stately takes on the general public via ‘’On Manor's Mind’’ rants for the alternative set, and rages about inane celebrities in his SNAPS—Suckas Needing A Pimp Slap—Of The Month column.
A lifelong fan of obscure so-bad-they're-good films, Stately also authors ‘’Manor On Movies’’, an affectionate homage to the genre, and one of the earliest columns of its kind still regularly published. It is available in hard copy and on a few websites besides its own, e.g. The Spinning Image. His long-term side project is a book dedicated to the horror/sci-fi end of what Manor has dubbed "junkfilms." As a result, he has befriended such notable screen veterans as James Karen, John Saxon, Walker Edmiston and Francine York.
Other journals that have carried Stately’s work, under the Manor moniker or otherwise, include "Inside Karate, Video Review, People (Australia), Filmfax, Tuber’s Voice" (the originators of the term ‘couch potato’), "Comic Release, Carbon 14", and "Brutarian", to name a few. In addition, he has repeatedly scored ‘Dishonorable Mention’ in the annual international Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, where the challenge is to compose the worst possible opening line for a novel.
radio and television.
In character, Manor has guested on countless radio programs throughout the US and Canada, including morning drive time shows in Philadelphia and New York City. During the Nineties "Wrestling Radio" boom, Stately set records for Most Guest Appearances on at least two stations, including topping a mark held by notorious talker Jim Cornette.
Manor was once booked on "Sneak Previews Goes Video"—an Eighties reworking of the popular movie-review program—to discuss wrestling videos, but the segment was red-lighted by PBS executives who considered the subject matter "too lowbrow."
video.
Stately can be heard providing color commentary on two volumes from the "Pro Wrestling From Japan" series, "Bam Bam Bigelow And Friends", and "Bruiser Brody Memorial", both featuring the American stars as they toured with the New Japan Pro Wrestling promotion in the late Eighties. A few tapes of his work with primordial ECW were briefly marketed, as well.

On 12 April in the match between Aab and Nordsjalland, a streaker invaded the pitch and Dahl took it upon himself to stop him. The Danish Premier League player says he has no regrets about kicking a streaker where it hurts, 'I know it's the stewards' job, but why shouldn't I be allowed to kick him in the balls? I just stuck out a leg and hit him straight in his special area. I guess it was a bit unfortunate for him, but it wasn't as if I was aiming. He sure went down fast.' This incident prompted comments by the Danish Press of the form 'Dahl is a player that keeps his eye on the balls".
On 26 June 2009 it was announced that he had signed a contract for 3.5 year with Hammarby IF, thus making his return in Allsvenskan.

The central midfielder went to Sweden in 2005 to play for third Division side Enköpings SK. After only one season at ESK, he signed for Helsingborgs IF before the 2006 season. His success at Helsingborgs was immediate. Following initial interest from Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp, Mariga looked set to sign for the Premier League team, but work permit issues held up the deal which was supposed to have cost around €2.7million.
Parma.
He moved to the Serie A club Parma initially on loan in August 2007. The Italian club had an option to buy him in the summer for a fee of 20 million Swedish kronor (around €2million). Mariga agreed to a four-year deal to keep him at Serie A side Parma for four years until the end of June 2012, after the club paid a transfer fee for Swedish Kronor 18 million (approx. 1.94 million euro). The deal, brokered by former Swede great Martin Dahlin, now an agent, falls short of the 20 Million Kronnor asking price initially set by Helsingborgs. 25% of the transfer fee will go to Enkopings SK, the club that first got Mariga to Sweden in 2005.
Mariga played 35 times for Parma in the Serie B during the 2008–2009 season scoring three times to help them back to Serie A for the 2009–2010 season.
In January 2010 he was set to sign for English Premier League club Manchester City, but he failed to obtain a work permit. It was later stated by Kenya's Prime Minister Raila Odinga that 22-year-old Mariga had eventually obtained a UK work permit but only after the transfer window for the Premier League had closed. Had Mariga successfully signed for Manchester City, he would have been the first player from the East African country to sign for a club in the top English league - a milestone later achieved by his brother, upon his transfer to Southampton in July 2013.
Inter Milan.
On 1 February 2010, the last day of the transfer window, Mariga moved to Inter Milan in a co-ownership deal however he initially attempted a big-money move to Manchester City until a work permit was turned down by the Home Office. The transfer fee was €5 million in a cash plus player deal which Parma got half the registration rights of Jonathan Biabiany (€2.5 million) and the loan of Luis Antonio Jiménez. Following the move, Inter president Massimo Moratti hailed Mariga's move as the "best thing that could have happened" to the club in the January transfer window. He made his debut for Internazionale in the 1st leg of the 2009 Coppa Italia Semi-final against Fiorentina. Inter narrowly won the match 1–0. In March 2010 Mariga became the first Kenyan to play in the UEFA Champions League, when he entered the field as a late substitute against Chelsea.
Mariga thought he scored his first goal for Inter on 24 April 2010 against Atalanta when he netted Samuel Eto's back pass into the roof of the net. However his shot deflected off Sulley Muntari and the goal was credited instead to the Ghanaian. He also scored a thrashing header against Genoa for the Nerazzuri in a game that ended 3–2.
On 17 June 2010, Inter bought him outright and bought back Biabiany for a reported fee around €10 million. However on the official accounts shown half of Biabiany was valued €4.2 million, while Mariga's half was also €4.2 million. Thus, Parma booked an financial cost of €800,000 for the discount but on Inter side a financial income of €800,000, as Inter actually paid €9.2 million only instead of €10 million. Moreover Luis Antonio Jiménez originally included in the deal but collapsed after Inter lost its portion on 25 June. In January 2011 Inter gifted Parma half of the registration rights of Joel Obi for a peppercorn fee but never left Inter, and half of the registration rights of Nwankwo for a price nearly equal to half the price Inter bought him.
At the start of season Mariga was loaned out to La Liga club Real Sociedad. It made Inter had a non-EU transfer quota which used on winter signing Juan and Fredy Guarín (the other quota was obtained from Philippe Coutinho). As Mariga was unable to return to Inter, he was loaned back to Parma instead and he scored his only goal against Lazio. The next fixture he was injured against Novara, which resulted he will be out for the rest of the season. After that Inter Milan coach Andrea Stramaccioni wanted Jonathan and Mariga to be back from Parma.
International career.
Mariga scored his first international goal for Kenya against Swaziland on 25 March 2007.
Personal life.
Mariga's father, Noah Wanyama, a left winger, played for A.F.C. Leopards and the Kenya national football team. His younger brother Victor Wanyama is also a professional football player, who is currently playing for Premier League side Southampton, while his other brothers Thomas and Sylvester are also footballers in the Kenyan Premier League. Their younger sister Mercy was the captain of the Lang'ata High School basketball team, and previously played football and netball.

Names for the Dutch language

Because of the turbulent history of both the Netherlands and Belgium (mostly because of the frequent change of economic and military power within the Low Countries), the names that other peoples have chosen to use to refer to the Dutch language vary more than for most other languages. The modern Dutch name for the language is "Nederlands".
In general, the names for the Dutch language can be arranged in seven groups according to their origin. 
Some languages use multiple forms.
Historical overview.
In English the language of the people of the Netherlands and Flanders is referred to as "Dutch"; or rarely as "Netherlandic", a term with multiple meanings. "Dutch" as a word is derived from Middle Dutch "duutsch, dūtsch" and was originally applied to continental West-Germanic speakers, be it of Dutch, Frisian or German origin. By 1600, it had come to be used exclusively as the language spoken in Flanders and the current Netherlands. The exclusive use of Dutch for the people of the Netherlands occurred after the Dutch formed an independent state and became the focus of English commercial rivalry.
Etymology of "Nederlands".
In modern Dutch, the language is called "Nederlands", which derives from "neder" (meaning "low", or "low-lying") and "land", with the adjective-forming suffix "-s" attached. In principle, "Nederland" could be used for any lowland region, but historically the use of "Nederland" became more restricted as a proper name for the Dutch country.
Dūtsch.
Before the appearance of "Nederlands", several variations on "Duuts" (Northern) and "Diets" (Southern) were used to refer to the Dutch language by its speakers. Etymologically, these all mean "common language" or "(language) of the common people", and was meant to create a distinction between Latin, which was at the time the language of science, nobility and the Church. These terms also had cognates in German, which still uses one of the German variants – "Deutsch" – as the name of the German language. The late 16th century, influenced by an expanded worldview and beginnings of (semi-) modern linguistics, saw the addition of the prefix "Neder-", thus creating "Nederduits". The approximate meaning of Nederduits is "common language of the Lowlands"; its usage and meaning illustrated by the quote below; 
"Neemt hy voor in Nederduitsch , zijn moederlijcke tale te zingen; des hoeft hy zich zoo luttel te schamen als de Hebreen, Griecken, Latijnen ... Wat onze spraeck belangt, die is, sedert weinige jaren herwaert, van bastertwoorden en onduits allengs geschuimt, en gebouwt, en geeft den leerling nu veel vooruit" 
["If he decides to sing in Dutch, his mother tongue, he needs to be no more ashamed of it than the Hebrews, Greeks, Romans ... As concerns our own language, in recent years it has been cleansed of loan words and un-Dutch usage, improved, and now gives the pupil great advantage"] 
Joost van den Vondel, Aenleidinge ter Nederduitsche Dichtkunste, 1650.
Until the middle of the 18th century, this term was quite popular among both scholars and writers of literature.
"Nederduits" mistakenly looked like it then meant "Low German", which is the literal translation of the word in contemporary Dutch. This was caused by the emergence of modern Germanic linguistic studies in Germany during the 19th century, which used the term "Niederdeutsch" for the Germanic languages/dialects which did not experience the second Germanic sound shift. Dutch linguists subsequently calqued the terminology, and used "Nederduits" as its translation. 
Until the late 18th century, Diets (and variants) remained the most common forms to refer to the Dutch language. The use of the term "Nederlands", which eventually replaced its synonyms in Dutch, is first attested to in a work printed at Gouda in 1482. () After that, "Nederlands" began to replace them as the main form. Diets was already rarely used several decades prior to the Second World War, but disappeared completely from everyday use following 1945 because Dutch fascists, during German occupation, had used the term extensively in their propaganda, attempting to invoke (through its common etymological origin with a link with "Deutsch") linkage to a ""Greater Germanic race"".
Flemish.
The term "Flemish" ("Vlaams") is used to describe the majority of Dutch dialects found in Belgium. It is derived from the name of the County of Flanders, from Middle Dutch "vlāmisch, vlemesch" "Fleming, Flemish person".
Dutch.
From Proto-Germanic "*þiudiskaz", "folk":
The English word "Dutch" is derived from the Middle Dutch word ""duutsch"". Old English itself had the related word ""þeod"", meaning ""people, race or nation"", which derives from Proto Germanic ""*theudo"". Originally this word was used to indicate all continental Germanic people who spoke West Germanic languages, but was later restricted to the Dutch language and the Dutch people.
Etymology.
The word Dutch comes from the proto-Germanic word "*þiudiskaz", and became "Duutsc" in Middle Dutch, which later gave the two early modern Dutch forms, "Duits" in the County of Holland and the Duchy of Brabant, and "Diets" in the County of Flanders. "Duits" has taken on the meaning of "German" and "Diets" meaning "Dutch" (along with "Nederlands") but no longer in general use (see the Diets article), dropped for its Nazi-era overtones. German "Deutsch" meaning "German" has the same origin.
The English word "Dutch" has also changed with time. It was around 1550, with growing cultural and economic contacts and the rise of an independent country, that the modern meaning arose, i.e., 'designating the people of the Netherlands or their language'. Prior to this, the meaning was more general and could refer to any Germanic-speaking area or the languages there (including the current Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as well as the Netherlands). For example:
Language of Holland.
During the Dutch golden age in which the Netherlands became a world power and established their empire, the province of Holland was the richest and most influential. Also, foreign visitors often only stayed in the province of Holland. Hence the language of the Dutch is often named after this province.
From Dutch: "Hollands":
Language of the Low Countries.
From "Low Countries" (literal translations of Dutch: "Nederlands"):
Some languages have literally translated "Language of the Low Countries", as in the English word ""Nether-land-ic"" meaning ""(of the) Low Countries"".
From or cognate with "Netherlands" (Dutch "Nederlands" referring to "Nederland" or "(de) Nederlanden"):
In Dutch ""Nederland"" refers to the country the Netherlands"; however, ""Nederlands"" (Dutch) does not refer to the ""language of the country of the Netherlands"", but rather "language of the Low Countries (including Flanders)". Many languages have a word for the Dutch language derived from this word ("such as French"), or have a cognate ("such as West Frisian").
Language of Flanders.
From "Flemish" (Dutch: "Vlaams") or from the region this refers to: "Flanders" (Dutch: "Vlaanderen"):

Hugh Algernon Weddell

Hugh Algernon Weddell (22 June 1819 – 22 July 1877) was a physician and botanist, specialising in South American flora.
Weddell was born at Birches House, Painswick near Gloucester, England but was raised in France and educated at the Lycée Henri IV, where he received a medical degree in 1841. He had also studied botany and became a respected member of the French botanical fraternity. While studying he accompanied Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797-1853) on numerous botanizing expeditions and he became a collaborator with Ernest Cosson (1819-1889) and Jacques Germain de Saint-Pierre (1815-1882) in the preparation of Flore des environs de Paris (1845). In 1843, he was invited to join the expedition of François Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau to South America, and he explored and collected botanical specimens in that continent for five years.
In May 1845, Weddell left the expedition which was then in Paraguay, and proceeded on a solitary journey which would take him into Peru and Bolivia. Before leaving Paris, he had been particularly instructed by the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle to undertake a thorough investigation of the "Cinchona" plant, or "fever bark" tree in its native habitat. "Cinchona", the source of quinine, was of great commercial importance and Europeans had been investigating it for nearly two hundred years with the goal of cultivating it in regions far removed from the Andes mountains. Weddell explored a number of regions where the trees grew and identified no fewer than fifteen distinct species of the genus "Cinchona" (Rubiaceae). The seeds which he took back to Paris were germinated in the Jardin des Plantes, and the plants were used to establish "Cinchona" forests in Java and elsewhere in the East Indies.
In 1847 he married Juana Bolognesi, a resident of Arequipa. By March 1848 he had returned to Paris, leaving his wife in South America.
In Paris, Weddell was given the post of assistant naturalist at the Museum. He held this office until 1853. Weddell made a second trip to South America in 1851. He returned to France and died on 22 July 1877 in Poitiers, while caring for his father.
He is commemorated in the names of a number of plants and animals, including the Dusky-headed Parakeet, "Aratinga weddellii".
This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Wedd. when citing a botanical name.

Heroic Age (literary theory)

In 20th-century studies of oral poetry and traditional literature, the Heroic Age was postulated as a stage in the development of human societies likely to give rise to legends about heroic deeds. According to some theorists, oral epic poetry would be created at the same period, and would be transmitted, by singers who displayed less creativity, through later periods. Scholars who adopted the theory of a heroic age include:
A widely shared view was that each society would pass through a heroic age only once. This apparently explains why, in the Chadwicks' world survey of oral and traditional poetry, "The Growth of Literature", medieval European epics such as the French Chansons de geste and the Spanish "Cantar de Mio Cid" are omitted: those societies are taken to have passed through a heroic age earlier.
Bryan Hainsworth has suggested that in the various so-called Heroic Ages named by modern scholars "what is described is a by-product ... of the tendency of heroic poetry to congeal into cycles, often ... around a signal event" (1993, p. 40). 
Historicity of the Ages.
Oral tales have been formed into classic literature centuries later so that the historicity of the events is left to uncertainty. The Greek Heroic Age as described in the Iliad is dated to historic events in 1460 to 1103 BC according to the chronology of Saint Jerome.
The Germanic Heroic Age as reflected in the Nibelungen can be dated to the 5th century picking up scenes from the foundation of Germanic kingdoms in Western Europe near the end of the first phase of the Völkerwanderung. The literature characters may refer to the historic Brunhilda (543–613) and Gundobad (480–516).
The Tamils of South India have an extensive literature describing their Heroic Age (the Sangam period). The Sangam poems share common themes with their Greek and German counterparts, such as glory, victory, fate and honour. The Sangam age is dated to between the 3rd century B.C.E and 2nd century C.E. However, the events described have been transmitted from orally from an earlier period. This is evidenced by the oral nature of the poems which (like the Iliad and Odyssey) use epithets and other metrical devices common in oral poetry.

Singular control

In optimal control, problems of singular control are problems that are difficult to solve because a straightforward application of Pontryagin's minimum principle fails to yield a complete solution. Only a few such problems have been solved, such as Merton's portfolio problem in financial economics or trajectory optimization in aeronautics. A more technical explanation follows.
The most common difficulty in applying Pontryagin's principle arises when the Hamiltonian depends linearly on the control formula_1, i.e., is of the form: formula_2 and the control is restricted to being between an upper and a lower bound: formula_3. To minimize formula_4, we need to make formula_1 as big or as small as possible, depending on the sign of formula_6, specifically:
If formula_8 is positive at some times, negative at others and is only zero instantaneously, then the solution is straightforward and is a bang-bang control that switches from formula_9 to formula_10 at times when formula_8 switches from negative to positive. 
The case when formula_8 remains at zero for a finite length of time formula_13 is called the singular control case. Between formula_14 and formula_15 the maximization of the Hamiltonian with respect to u gives us no useful information and the solution in that time interval is going to have to be found from other considerations. (One approach would be to repeatedly differentiate formula_16 with respect to time until the control u again explicitly appears, which is guaranteed to happen eventually. One can then set that expression to zero and solve for u. This amounts to saying that between formula_14 and formula_15 the control formula_1 is determined by the requirement that the singularity condition continues to hold. The resulting so-called singular arc will be optimal if it satisfies the Kelley condition:
. This condition is also called the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition).
The term bang-singular control refers to a control that has a bang-bang portion as well as a singular portion.

Fantaghirò series

Fantaghirò (alternately titled The Cave of the Golden Rose) is an Italian fantasy film series based on Italo Calvino's "Fanta-Ghiro the Beautiful". The series consists of five television movies which were released between 1991 and 1996. It was produced by Rete Italia and directed by Lamberto Bava, and filmed in the Czech and Slovak Republics; the musical score, including the theme song "Mio Nemico" (My Enemy), was written by Amedeo Minghi. The series has been dubbed in Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, English, French, Polish, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian and Sinhala.
The cult success of the film series lead director Lamberto Bava to make a few other television movies in this style, including "Desideria e l'Anello del Drago" ("Desideria"), "La Principessa e il Povero" ("The Princess and the Pauper") and "Sorellina e il Principe del Sogno" ("Princess Alisea"). The movie series also led to the creation of an animated television series by BRB Internacional, also titled "Fantaghirò".
Films.
The series takes place in a fairy tale setting, featuring princesses, princes, witches, wizards and talking animals. Director Lamberto Bava said the films were influenced by "Legend", "Ladyhawke" and "Willow", as well as by Disney animated movies and the 1950s fantasy cinema.
Fantaghirò (1991).
Fantaghirò is the youngest of three princesses born to a warrior King. Although beautiful and intelligent, she causes many problems for her family because she goes against everything expected for a woman in her kingdom, by being literate, adventurous and rebellious, which makes her father furious. One day, the warrior King receives an invitation from the enemy king Romualdo to a duel that can potentially end the centuries-long war that has been going on between the two kingdoms. The warrior king then learns that only one of his three daughters can win the duel. Fantaghirò sees this as a chance for her to prove herself.
"Fantaghirò 2" (1992).
Fantaghirò and Romualdo are due to be married, but their wedding is cut short when news arrives that Fantaghirò's father has been kidnapped by the Black Queen. The Black Queen demands that Fantaghirò and Romualdo submit to her rule, but they refuse and Romualdo declares war. He sets out with his army, leaving behind Fantaghirò, who has sworn not to lift another weapon for the rest of her life. However, Fantaghirò finds that she has to break her promise, and secretly sets out on her own to the Dark Kingdom, where she learns that the Black Queen's plan is much more sinister.
"Fantaghirò 3" (1993).
The evil wizard Tarabas learns that his powerful kingdom will be defeated by a royal child of no more than ten years of age. He becomes obsessed with learning how this will happen, so he orders his clay warriors to kidnap all of the world's royal children. When the children of Fantaghirò's sisters become targets, Fantaghirò and Romualdo protect them from the attacking clay soldiers. However, during the fight Romualdo accidentally falls into a cursed river and turns into stone. Fantaghirò then learns that she has to find Tarabas if she wants to save her beloved Romualdo.
"Fantaghirò 4" (1994).
A black cloud is travelling throughout the land, destroying everything it touches. When the black cloud consumes Fantaghirò's castle, she allies herself with Prince Parsel to track the black cloud to its origins and stop whoever is casting it. Along the way, Fantaghirò is reunited with the wizard Tarabas, who agrees to help them on their quest, and Princess Anjelica, who is in love with Tarabas.
"Fantaghirò 5" (1996).
Fantaghirò is captured by the Black Queen, who has been unable to perform magic ever since she helped Fantaghirò in the previous films. The Black Queen is about to decapitate Fantaghirò when she is suddenly sucked into an alternate reality where she has to join forces with a scoundrel named Aries in defeating a villain who eats children.
Characters.
Fantaghirò.
Fantaghirò, portrayed by Alessandra Martines, is the main character of all five films. She is the youngest princess of three. She is outspoken, headstrong and never retreats from battle. In the first film, she is an impulsive troublemaker who likes to provoke her father and sisters, but underneath it she has a good heart. By the second film onwards, she is accepted as a fighter who will do whatever it takes to protect her loved ones, even if that means sacrificing her own life. She is deeply in love with Romualdo, who was previously her kingdom's enemy. They are married in the third film and adopt the orphaned Princess Esmeralda as their daughter. Fantaghirò has long red-brown hair which she cuts into a boy-cut in the first and second film, but in the third film onwards she only has the boy-cut. Fantaghirò tries to befriend all creatures and people she meets, unless they try to harm those she cares about. She is very forgiving and looks past physical appearances. Fantaghiro's castle is really Bouzov Castle.
Romualdo.
Romualdo, portrayed by Kim Rossi Stuart, is Fantaghirò's husband. After the death of his father, Romualdo seeks to end the centuries-long war his ancestors have waged against Fantaghirò's people by challenging Fantaghirò's father to single combat. He falls in love with her in the first film and becomes obsessed with finding her. He is shocked when he meets her properly for the first time, as she has chosen to replace her father as Romualdo's opponent, and is disguised as a man. Eventually he learns that she is a princess and the two are bethrothed. They are due to be married early in the second film, but the ceremony is postponed when the Dark Witch kidnaps Fantaghirò's father. Romualdo becomes the Dark Witch's target, and she bewitches him to fall in love with her. Romualdo eventually regains his memories thanks to Fantaghirò and the White Witch. In the third film, Romualdo turns into a statue whilst fighting Tarabas' men, and is only revived near the end of the movie, when the pair are finally married. In the fourth film Stuart did not want to return again for the role, so Romualdo was transformed into the hideously ugly Fiodor, portrayed by Riccardo Serventi Longhi. At the end of the film, Fiodor is transformed back to Romualdo, with stock footage from the first film being used. Romualdo does not appear at all in the fifth film, except in flashbacks. His castle is really Pernštejn Castle.
The White Witch.
The White Witch (), portrayed by Angela Molina in the first film and Katarína Kolajová in the second film, is a good witch and friend of Fantaghirò. She has been instrumental in protecting and guiding Fantaghirò ever since she was a baby, although the princess is not always aware of the White Witch's involvement. The White Witch can transform into various animals, including a goose, a mouse and a cat. She also transformed into the White Knight in order to train Fantaghirò in the art of swordsmanship. In the second film, the White Witch renounces her powers in order to free Fantaghirò from a magical promise she had made. Although she does not appear in the later films, early in the third film it is mentioned that she has retired to the country.
The Black Witch.
The Black Witch (), portrayed by Brigitte Nielsen, is the evil and perverse counterpart of the White Witch, who first appears in the second film and wants to destroy Fantaghirò and Romualdo's relationship. She lures them to her kingdom by kidnapping Fantaghirò's father, and then casts a spell on Romualdo to make him fall in love with her. Fantaghirò and Romualdo manage to defeat her, and she is turned to stone and blown up into many pieces. In the third film her former minions, Bolt and Lightning, put her back together and revive her because Fantaghirò needs her help against Tarabas. Because the Dark Witch does help Fantaghirò, albeit reluctantly, her evil powers are weakened. In the fourth and fifth films she constantly tries to get back at Fantaghirò so she can be all powerful again. Her "Fantaghiro 2" castle is really Bojnice Castle and Nielsen said she based her witch role on the character of Grimhilde in Disney's "Snow White".
Tarabas.
Tarabas, portrayed by Nicholas Rogers, is a wizard who appears in the third and fourth films. He is initially a very powerful villain who is feared by magicians in every kingdom, but he discovers a prophecy that a royal child no older than ten years will defeat him.

He crosses paths with Fantaghirò and falls in love with her, eventually asking her to marry him in exchange for reviving Romualdo, who has been turned into stone. In the end, Tarabas lets Fantaghirò free from her promise and the two kiss once before Fantaghirò returns to her true love. He redeems himself with Esmeralda by allowing her to see her parents one last time, an act of kindness which fulfills the prophecy of his dark powers' downfall. Tarabas renounces his evil ways and lives in peace until the fourth film when he is accused of creating a destructive black cloud consuming all in its path. Tarabas reunites with Fantaghirò to track down the source of the black cloud and discovers that it was conjured by his father, Darken. At the end of the fourth film Tarabas decides to renounce his love for Fantaghirò and stay with Princess Angelica of Tohor.

Darken.
Darken, portrayed by Horst Buchholz, is a cruel wizard so powerful that it is forbidden to speak his name. Aside from being the source of all evil in Fantaghirò's world, he is the father of Tarabas, and wants his son to be just as evil as he is.

King.
King, portrayed by Mario Adorf, is Fantaghirò's father and appears in the first two films. He is initially disappointed by Fantaghirò's birth, as he had been expecting a son, who would become his heir.

She hates water, and cannot fly if she falls in a river.
Lightning.
Lightning (), portrayed by Jakub Zdeněk, is a magical sprite and older brother of Bolt. He starts to rebel against his mistress, the Dark Witch, early in the second film, and it is he who instigates Bolt to do the same.

Catherine.
Catherine, portrayed by Ornella Marcucci in the first film and Barbora Kodetova in the second and third films, is the eldest sister of Fantaghirò. She is level-headed, wise and patient. She marries Cataldo in the first film, is pregnant in the second film, and has a son in the third film. She has a non-speaking role in the fourth film when their castle is shrunk to the size of a toy, but her face cannot be seen clearly.
Caroline.
Caroline, portrayed by Kateřina Brožová, is one of the Fantaghirò's sisters. She has golden hair, is a hopeless romantic and is well aware of her beauty, traits that usually infuriate Fantaghirò. In the first film she marries Ivaldo, she is pregnant in the second film, and by the third film she has a son. She can briefly be seen in the fourth film, but only at distance, and her face cannot be seen clearly.
Cataldo.
Cataldo, portrayed by Stefano Davanzati, is one of Romualdo's closest friends. He appears in the first and second films as Romualdo's companion. He's the one who comes up with the idea of holding a swimming competition to reveal Fantaghirò's true gender in the first film. He later falls in love with and marries Catherine.

The Queen of the Elves tells Fantaghirò that the wizard she seeks is Tarabas.
Goldeye.
Goldeye, portrayed by Karel Roden, is a minor villain in the second film. He is a bandit who robs anyone he comes across. Fantaghirò humiliates him at the beginning of the film by beating him in armed combat. Later their paths cross again and Goldeye tries to get his revenge by making Fantaghirò dress up as a belly dancer.
Esmeralda.
Esmeralda, portrayed by Elena D'Ippolito, is a young princess seen in the third film. Her parents are killed when Tarabas' clay soldiers attack under his command to kidnap all the royal children of the world. Fantaghirò takes Esmeralda under her care and eventually adopts her. Esmeralda is playful and headstrong, much like Fantaghirò was in her youth.
Angelica.
Angelica, portrayed by Agathe de La Fontaine, is the princess of the oriental kingdom of Tohor. She has listened to stories of Tarabas from when he was a dark wizard, and has adored him. When she learns that Tarabas is in her kingdom, she finds him and declares her love for him. Tarabas rebuffs her affections throughout the entire movie until the very end, when he promises to try to love her.
Nameless.
Nameless (), portrayed by Remo Girone, is the villain of the fifth film. He is an ogre made of enchanted "apalicandro" wood, which renders him invulnerable to almost all attacks. Animated with the magic of a hundred witches, Nameless was created in order to end a centuries-long war of attrition, only to rebel against his creators. He travels through different worlds on a flying galleon in order to become more human by feeding on children. His presence alone is enough to transform food items into deadly monsters.

Sponging-house

A sponging-house was a place of temporary confinement for debtors in the United Kingdom. 
If someone were to get into debt, their creditor would lay a complaint with the sheriff, the sheriff sent his bailiffs, and the debtor would be taken to the local sponging-house. This was not a debtor's prison, as such, but a private house, often the bailiff's own home. The debtor would be held there temporarily in the hope that they could make some arrangement with the creditors. Anthony Trollope set out the system in his novel "The Three Clerks" of 1857: 
If debtors could not sort matters out quickly, they were then taken before a court and transferred to a debtor's prison.
Sponging-houses had a terrible reputation, which was made clear in a description by Montagu Williams, a London lawyer who knew them well, in his "Down East and Up West" of 1894: 
The idea of the sponging-house was based on that of the sponge that gave it its name, which readily gives up its contents on being squeezed. The sponging-house was the place where debtors had any available cash squeezed out of them, partly to the creditor's benefit, but also to that of the bailiff who ran it.
In French, “"éponger une dette"” (sponge-up a debt) means to repay one’s debt.

C.D. Feirense

Clube Desportivo Feirense, commonly known as CD Feirense or just Feirense, is a Portuguese football team founded on 19 March 1918 from the town of Santa Maria da Feira. Feirense is currently playing the Segunda Liga. Their current chairman is Rodrigo Nunes Silva Abelha and their current manager is Quim Machado. The club currently plays at the Estádio Marcolino de Castro with a capacity of 5,500 spectators. The club currently has a sponsorship deal with Adidas.
Stadium.
The Estádio Marcolino de Castro is a multi-use stadium in the town of Santa Maria da Feira. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Feirense, who play in the Portuguese Liga. The stadium is capable of holding other sporting events. Its capacity for a football match is 5,500 spectators. Estádio Marcolino de Castro was built in 1962 when Feirense was promoted for the very first time to the top-flight Portuguese Liga.
History.
One of the first initiatives of its founders, Luis Amorim, Artur Bastos, Luis Cadilon and Arthur Lee, was to acquire land to build the first playground in the woods at Picalhos near the railway Valley Vouga. In 1924 they leased land and started embankments and soon the first few games took place against the Lourosa 4 May 1924 in which the Feirense won 2–1. The first President was Feirense Alcides Machado da Silva who took office on 30 December 1924.
In 1926 and since then has kept the Feirense, created a committee with the aim of acquiring a new site with better conditions for a new field, having managed in the Place of Montinho, closer to the center of the Town of Fair, belonging to Mr. Simon Adriano. Curiously, this time the Feirense were fitted with a red and black sweater with vertical stripes. On 2 March 1931 the field of Montinho was opened with a selection match between FC Porto and Aveiro, and that year the team was equipped with a blue shirt, black shorts and black socks.
In the 1931/32 season CDFeirense first participated in a tournament, debuting in the championship of the promotion of Aveiro, the lower division of the district, being defeated 2–1 in the first official game in the field of Cortegaça.Since the late '30s and until 1950 the Feirense went through various difficulties and the main note of relief was the creation of the first emblem of CD Feirense designed by Antonio da Costa. The Feirense continued its participation in the championship district of Aveiro and 15 January 1955 Marcolino Castro was elected for the 1st time President of Feirense (he was later elected 5 more times and a total of 9 seasons) and the team started to equip with blue shirt, white shorts. The next year for the first time the team participated in the national championship of the 3rd Division, with the first game played in Avintes. In March 1956 the club's youth department was begun with the creation of a team of juniors.
In 1958 the first statutes of the club were approved, the flag's colors and design for the new badge were authored by Dr. Humberto de Paiva. In the 1959/60 season Feirense won the first district championship of Aveiro and at the same time played the 3rd Division, managing to also climb to the 2nd Division. The Feirense repeated the title of district champion of Aveiro in seasons 1965/66 and 1967/68. In 1960/61, they first participated in the National League division 2.
In the early '60s Feirense had one of the best periods in its history, achieving victory in the northern part of the 2nd Division, inauguration of the current stadium and Marcolino Castro premiere at the 1st National Division in 1962/63. In 1968/69, Feirense won its first title of the Aveiro district youth in the juvenile level. In 1969 Arthur Eng Brandão, patron of the training school, was elected the 1st time chairman of the board, which happened 4 more times and a total of 9 times.
Arthur and Marcolino Brandão de Castro were the presidents who had the longest terms leading the club. In 1975/76 the club's youth were in evidence with the presence of the youth team in the final of the National 2nd division held in Tomar. In 1976/77 the Feirense won the central area of the 2nd division next season and raced for the 2nd time the national championship in Division 1. In 1982/83, the youth team of juvenile Feirense after winning the same district title, disputed the semi-finals of the National Youth Cup. On 22 September 1987 Feirense for the first time had a field of natural grass turf with the inauguration of the stadium Marcolino Castro. In 1988/89, the Feirense winner was again the center region of the 2nd division next season and race for the 3rd time the national championship in Division 1.In 1990, Fernando Carvalho da Feirense's cycling team won the 52nd back to Portugal in cycling. In 1990/91 the Feirense was matched in the semi-finals of the Cup of Portugal with FC Porto. After the draw at the end of extra time forced the second game in the Antas stadium which was eventually eliminated. In this year also participated for the 1st time in 2 then created division of honor. In 1996 he was assigned to the CD Feirense medal for sporting merit by the secretary of state of the sport. After several district titles won by the club's youth, we have since the 1999/2000 season on staying at the same time of 3 levels (junior, youth and started) in the national championships, the unique situation in the district in so many consecutive years, continuing to gain Titles on children and schools. Was created in 2000 by Rodrigo Nunes, then responsible for the Juvenile Department, the training school Arthur Brandao. In 2001 he took possession for the first time Rodrigo Nunes, the current President of Feirense and presented his model of the sport of golf, the club anthem written by Ernesto Campos, the monthly magazine Feirense Magazine", the 1st Gala club, the party Christmas and amended the statutes and emblem. At this time the Feirense revitalized the gym and set the terms of swimming, cycling and handball. In the 2002/03 season rose again to the 2nd Division of honor. In June 2003, Rodrigo Nunes is elected for a 2nd term. This would be unprecedented, as no previous president had been elected two consecutive mandates. In late 2004 the Feirense, presented the 1st phase of the new Sports Complex, and from there all the athletes of the club began to train and play only on lawns natural and synthetic, unique in Portugal even in clubs called major (Benfica, Sporting, Porto). In June 2005, Rodrigo Nunes is the third consecutive elected President of the Board for more than a full biennium and it will be at the helm of the Feirense for 6 consecutive years, a situation that has never happened before. In the 2007/08 season, the senior team handball went to the 2nd Division. In the 2011/12 the main soccer team participated in the Portuguese Liga, with Rodrigo Nunes still at the helm.

3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)

The 3rd Infantry Brigade was a regular British Army formation, which was part of the 1st Infantry Division. Originally formed in 1809, the brigade had a long history, having been present at the Peninsula War, the Crimean War, and the First and Second World Wars.
History.
This brigade saw service as part of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front (World War I) and with the British Expeditionary Force during the World War II Battle of France. After the retreat from Dunkirk it remained in Great Britain until 1943 when it was sent to North Africa to take part in the Algerian and Tunisian Campaigns. 
On 11 June 1943 the 1st Infantry Division was sent to the Italian island of Pantelleria which they captured and occupied before being sent to Italy. They fought in Italy until 28 January 1945 when they were sent to Palestine as a garrison where they remained to the end of the war. As part of 1st Division the Brigade was in Egypt after the war until returning to Chiseldon, Wiltshire. During the Suez Crisis the brigade was moved to Malta, in August 1956, from where they went to Egypt on the aircraft carrier HMS Theseus, reaching Port Said just as the ceasefire was declared. It then went on to Cyprus in 1956. Following operations against EOKA, the brigade was disbanded there in 1963.
From 1972, the 3rd Infantry Brigade was headquartered in the Kitchen Hill Factory in Lurgan until moving to Portadown in late 1976, under HQ Northern Ireland and was the HQ element for the security forces which controlled the South Armagh region of Ulster, including several battalions of the Ulster Defence Regiment. The brigade was disbanded on September 1, 2004 and its former units divided between 8 Brigade and 39 Brigade.

Jim Malloy

Jim Malloy (May 23, 1932 – May 18, 1972), was an American racecar driver.
Born in Columbus, Nebraska, Malloy's family moved to Englewood, Colorado, where he attended grade school and high school. Malloy would letter in football and baseball in high school. He attended Colorado State University for two years.
Early Racing Years.
In 1955 Malloy started driving Semi-Modifieds at Lakeside Speedway in Denver, Colorado. He continued racing at Lakeside through 1962. This is where he branched out and ran with the fledgling Canadian American Modified Racing Association (CAMRA), an organization that raced mainly in the Northwest United States and in British Columbia. The CAMRA series would become a series where a driver could develop their skills and move up to Indy Car racing and running the Indianapolis 500. Billy Foster, Art Pollard, Dick Simon and later Indy 500 winner Tom Sneva, his brother Jerry Sneva, Eldon Rasmussen and Cliff Hucul would race in the Indy 500 after graduating from the CAMRA series. Malloy was no exception. He drove a modified built and prepared by his brother Jerry Malloy and in 1964 & 1965 he won the CAMRA championship.
Indy Car Racing.
In 1967 he started driving USAC sprint cars. This is when Malloy would get a huge break in is racing career. He was hired by the Jim Robbins Race Team to drive USAC Indy Cars. He would run eight races for the Robbins team that year with his best finish being a 6th at Langhorne, Pennsylvania. The Robbins team would bring Malloy to Indianapolis in 1968 where he would be the fastest rookie qualifier. He started 14th and finished 22nd, dropping out after 64 laps with mechanical failure. In 1969 Malloy started 13th and despite an early 22 minute pit stop he managed an 11th place finish. In 1970 he qualified 9th, his best starting position to date. Unfortunately his car broke a rear constant velocity joint and hit the 4th turn wall at the end of the pace lap, putting himself out of the race even before the start. In 1971 was originally entered in a car for the M.V.S. Racing Team. But when Lee Roy Yarbrough crashed hard with one of Dan Gurney's Eagles, his injuries was severe enough that he could not compete in the Indy 500 in 1971. Dan Gurney asked Malloy to pilot the Eagle in place of Yarbrough. He drove a solid race finishing 4th, his personal best at Indianapolis.
In 1972 Malloy signed on to drive for the Gerhardt racing team and one of the very fast 1972 Eagles. During the month of May Malloy and the new Eagle was among the fastest cars. During the practice session on May 14, he was attempting to break the speed barrier (which other Indy drivers were trying to do at the time) when his car mysteriously cut sharply to the right and crashed head-on into the outside retaining wall confining Turn 3 at about . He died in the hospital, four days after being pulled from his destroyed car. He never regained consciousness.
Malloy drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1967-1972 seasons, with 61 career starts, including the 1968-1971 Indianapolis 500 races. In the In his Champ Car career, he finished in the top ten 23 times, with his best finish in 2nd position in 1969 at the Milwaukee Mile, driving for Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing in a substitute role for the injured Al Unser.
Other Racing.
Malloy attempted to race in the 1966 Daytona 500 but only managed a 21st place finish in his qualifying race and failed to make the field.
Malloy also drove a 1958 Edsel Pacer at Colorado National Speedway in 1968.
In 1979 Malloy was inducted into the Colorado Motorsports Hall of Fame.

Grosser Preis von Berlin

The Grosser Preis von Berlin, formerly known as the Deutschland-Preis, is a Group 1 flat horse race in Germany open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Hoppegarten over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.
History.
The event was established in 1888, and it was originally staged at Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin. It was initially contested over 2,000 metres, and was extended to 2,200 metres in 1897. It was transferred to Grunewald and increased to 2,400 metres in 1909. A new distance of 2,600 metres was introduced in 1927.
The race returned to Hoppegarten in 1934, and it was renamed the Grosser Preis der Reichshauptstadt in 1937. From this point it was run over 2,400 metres, and it reverted to 2,600 metres in 1943.
The event switched to Düsseldorf and was renamed the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen in 1947. That year's running was over 2,400 metres, and it returned to 2,600 metres in 1948. Its current period over 2,400 metres began in 1965.
The present race grading system was introduced in Germany in 1972, and the Grosser Preis von Nordrhein-Westfalen was classed at Group 1 level. Its original title, the Grosser Preis von Berlin, was restored in 1977.
The event became known as the Deutschland-Preis in 1996. It was held at Hamburg and merged with the Hansa-Preis in 2010. It returned to Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin in 2011.

Eikefjord

Eikefjord is a former municipality in the Sunnfjord district in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It existed from 1923 until 1964 and it is part of the present-day municipality of Flora. The administrative center of the former municipality of Eikefjord was the village of Eikefjord, where Eikefjord Church is located. 
The municipality of Eikefjord is located at the end of the Eikefjorden, about east of the town of Florø. The lake Endestadvatnet was part of the municipality. The municipality encompassed the immediate area around the village of Eikefjord and to the east and south of the village.
Name.
The municipality was named after the old "Eikefjord" farm (Old Norse: "Eikifjǫrðr") since the Eikefjord Church was located there. The farm is named after the nearby fjord which is located nearby. The fjord name comes from the Old Norse word "eiki" which means oak wood.
History.
The parish of Eikefjord was established as a municipality on 1 January 1923, when it was split off from the large municipality of Kinn. The new municipality had an initial population of 929 residents. On 1 January 1964, Eikefjord was merged with municipality of Kinn, the town of Florø, and parts of the municipalities of Bru, Vevring, and Bremanger to form the new municipality of Flora. Prior to the merger, Eikefjord had 919 inhabitants.

Power iteration

In mathematics, the power iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm: given a matrix "A", the algorithm will produce a number λ (the eigenvalue) and a nonzero vector "v" (the eigenvector), such that "Av" = λ"v".
The algorithm is also known as the Von Mises iteration.
The power iteration is a very simple algorithm. It does not compute a matrix decomposition, and hence it can be used when "A" is a very large sparse matrix. However, it will find only one eigenvalue (the one with the greatest absolute value) and it may converge only slowly.
The method.
The power iteration algorithm starts with a vector "b"0, which may be an approximation to the dominant eigenvector or a random vector. The method is described by the iteration
So, at every iteration, the vector "b""k" is multiplied by the matrix "A" and normalized.
Under the assumptions:
then:
Note that the sequence formula_3 does not necessarily converge. It can be shown that:
<br>
formula_5
where: formula_6 is an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue, and formula_7. The presence of the term formula_8
implies that formula_9
does not converge unless formula_10
Under the two assumptions listed above, the sequence formula_11 defined by:
formula_12
converges to the dominant eigenvalue.
This can be run as a simulation program with the following simple algorithm:
The value of "norm" converges to the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue, and the vector "b" to an associated eigenvector.

This algorithm is the one used to calculate such things as the Google PageRank.
The method can also be used to calculate the spectral radius of a matrix by computing the Rayleigh quotient
Analysis.
Let formula_14 be decomposed into its Jordan canonical form: formula_15,
where the first column of formula_16 is an eigenvector of formula_14 corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue formula_18.
Since the dominant eigenvalue of formula_14 is unique,
the first Jordan block of formula_20 is the formula_21 matrix
formula_22, where
formula_18 is the largest eigenvalue of "A" in magnitude.
The starting vector formula_2
can be written as a linear combination of the columns of V:
formula_25.
By assumption, formula_2 has a nonzero component in the direction of the dominant eigenvalue, so
formula_27.
The computationally useful recurrence relation for formula_28
can be rewritten as:
formula_29,
where the expression: formula_30 is more amenable to the following analysis.
<br>
formula_31
<br>
The expression above simplifies as formula_32
<br>
formula_33
as
formula_34.
<br>
The limit follows from the fact that the eigenvalue of
formula_35
is less than 1 in magnitude, so
formula_36
as
formula_34
<br>
It follows that:
<br>
formula_38
as
formula_39
<br>
Using this fact,
formula_40
can be written in a form that emphasizes its relationship with formula_6 when k is large:
<br>
formula_42
where formula_43
and
formula_44
as
formula_32
<br>
The sequence
formula_46 is bounded, so it contains a convergent subsequence. Note that the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue is only unique up to a scalar, so although the sequence formula_47 may not converge,
formula_40 is nearly an eigenvector of "A" for large k.
Alternatively, if "A" is diagonalizable, then the following proof yields the same result
<br>
Let λ1, λ2, …, λ"m" be the m eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) of A and let "v"1, "v"2, …, "v""m" be the corresponding eigenvectors. Suppose that formula_49 is the dominant eigenvalue, so that formula_50 for formula_51.
The initial vector formula_52 can be written:
If formula_52 is chosen randomly (with uniform probability), then "c"1 ≠ 0 with probability 1. Now,
The expression within parentheses converges to formula_56 because formula_57 for formula_51. On the other hand, we have
Therefore, formula_60 converges to (a multiple of) the eigenvector formula_56. The convergence is geometric, with ratio
where formula_63 denotes the second dominant eigenvalue. Thus, the method converges slowly if there is an eigenvalue close in magnitude to the dominant eigenvalue.
Applications.
Although the power iteration method approximates only one eigenvalue of a matrix, it remains useful for certain computational problems. For instance, Google uses it to calculate the PageRank of documents in their search engine, and Twitter uses it to show users recommendations of who to follow. For matrices that are well-conditioned and as sparse as the Web matrix, the power iteration method can be more efficient than other methods of finding the dominant eigenvector.
Some of the more advanced eigenvalue algorithms can be understood as variations of the power iteration. For instance, the inverse iteration method applies power iteration to the matrix formula_64. Other algorithms look at the whole subspace generated by the vectors formula_60. This subspace is known as the Krylov subspace. It can be computed by Arnoldi iteration or Lanczos iteration.
Another variation of the power method that simultaneously gives n eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,
as well as accelerated convergence as formula_66 is

North Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)

North Wales is an electoral region of the National Assembly for Wales, consisting of nine constituencies. The region elects thirteen members, nine directly elected constituency members and four additional members. The electoral region was first used in the 1999 Welsh Assembly election, when the Assembly for Wales was created.
Each constituency elects one Assembly Member by the first past the post electoral system, and the region as a whole elects four additional or top-up Assembly Members, to create a degree of proportional representation. The additional member seats are allocated from closed lists by the d'Hondt method, with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.
County and Westminster boundaries.
As created in 1999, the region covered the most of the preserved county of Clwyd, part of the preserved county of Gwynedd, and part of the preserved county of Powys. Other parts of these preserved counties were within the Mid and West Wales electoral region. For the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, however, boundaries changed, and the region now covers all of the preserved county of Clwyd and part of the preserved county of Gwynedd. The rest of Gwynedd is in the Mid and West Wales region.
The Assembly constituencies have the names of constituencies of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster). For Westminster election purposes, however, there are no electoral regions, and constituency boundary changes became effective for the 2010 United Kingdom general election.
Electoral region profile.
The region is a mix of rural and urban areas, with the population higher in the east, where can be found the region's largest town, Wrexham, and the working-class conurbations of Deeside. The western areas, including the Isle of Anglesey (Ynys Mon), are largely rural. Although Anglesey and Gwynedd are home to large numbers of Welsh speakers, the language is not widely spoken in the north-east.

Shadows and Symbols

__NOTOC__
"Shadows and Symbols" is the second episode of the seventh season of "", the 152nd overall. The episode references an earlier episode, "Far Beyond the Stars" (6.13), in which Benjamin Sisko imagines himself as Benny Russell, a science fiction writer during the mid-twentieth century.
Plot.
Sisko meets Ezri, the new host of the Dax symbiont, before departing Earth for the planet Tyree with his father, Joseph, and son Jake. Ezri wishes to accompany them on their search for Bajor's mythical Orb of the Emissary, which Sisko has been led to believe exists. Back at the station, Kira prepares a blockade to stop the Romulans, who have placed weapons on a Bajoran moon. On a Klingon ship, Worf, O'Brien, Bashir, and Quark embark on a mission of their own: to destroy a Dominion shipyard, thus securing a place for the spirit of Worf's dead wife Jadzia in the sacred Klingon afterlife of Sto-Vo-Kor. 
Sisko and his crew arrive on Tyree. Guided by his visions, they begin a long trek across the vast desert terrain. Eventually, Sisko stops and digs on a seeming whim, while his father, son, and Ezri can only watch. 
Kira sets her blockade with old Bajoran ships, and four Romulan warbirds approach, just hours away; while Worf and his companions prepare to face their own danger in Jadzia's name. On Tyree, Sisko's digging uncovers an Orb ark, but dangerous visions cause him to hesitate from exposing the Orb within. 
Back on the Klingon ship, Worf, having reached the star system where the shipyard is located, masterminds a plan in which his vessel will fly toward the sun and trigger a plasma ejection that will destroy the Dominion facility and illuminate the gates of Sto-vo-kor for Jadzia. Meanwhile, Sisko's visions force him to inexplicably and hastily bury the ark containing the Orb without opening it. 
Worf and his comrades manage to execute their plan and demolish the shipyard — a victory that finally allows for Jadzia's entrance into Sto-vo-kor. At the same time, Kira successfully causes the Romulans to back down. On Tyree, Ezri forces Sisko to open the ark. But when he does, an energy vortex is unleashed which opens the wormhole and expels from it the Pah-wraiths — the enemies of the Prophets — who sealed the anomaly. His mission successful, Sisko encounters what appears to be his dead mother Sarah. After commending him, she reveals that she is one of the wormhole aliens, who took over the real Sarah's body years ago to ensure Sisko's birth and the fulfillment of his destiny.
Afterwards when the Tyree team return to Deep Space Nine, the Bajoran people are praising Sisko for his reopening the wormhole- Temple of the Prophets. His crew welcome him back, and are perplexed at the arrival of Ezri Dax.

Battle of Glenlivet

The Battle of Glenlivet was fought on 3 October 1594 near Allanreid and Morinsh in Scotland.
Background.
This battle is often seen as a religious conflict, and was fought by the Catholic forces of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly and Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, who were victorious over the Protestant forces of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll. When the decree of 12 November 1593 came out, by which Catholics were ordered to give up their faith or leave the country, Huntly refused to obey. His continued resistance culminated in the Battle of Glenlivet, where, accompanied by the Earl of Errol, he engaged Argyll's army above Allt a' Choileachain.
Forces.
The Earl of Huntly's forces consisted of 2,000 Highlanders from Clan Gordon, Clan Hay, Clan Comyn, Clan Cameron, Clan Cumming.
The Earl of Argyll's forces consisted of 10,000 Highlanders from Clan Campbell, Clan Murray, Clan Stewart, Clan Forbes, Clan Macgillivray, Clan Maclean, Clan Grant, and the Chattan Confederation of Clan Mackintosh.
The battle.
Huntly's retainers prepared for battle by confession and communion. Mass was said at Auchindoun for them by Father James Gordon, S.J., before they set out on their march through Glenrinnes. Their weapons were sprinkled with holy water, and a cross placed on their armour symbolised that they fought in defence of the Cross of Christ.
The Earl of Huntly's force of 2,000 men routed the Earl of Argyll's force of 10,000. Huntly's victory was a dramatic victory of horse and artillery over irregular infantry.
The location of the battlefield is 57.348964° N 3.251002° W, approximately east of Glenlivet. The site of the battle is currently under research, to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.
Archaeology.
A group of standing stones near to the site of the battle are said to have an association with the Battle of Glenlivet, although it is not known when the stones were set.

Sun size relative to its distance from Proxima Centauri.
The diameter of the Sun is about 1,390,000 km, and its nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.22 light years (3.99 x 1013 km) away. Therefore, the ratio of distance to diameter is 28,700,000 : 1, so if the Sun were one centimeter in diameter, Proxima Centauri would be 287 km away.

Young Man with a Horn (soundtrack)

Young Man with a Horn is a 10" LP album, released by Columbia Records as CL-6106 on March 13, 1950, featuring trumpeter Harry James and singer Doris Day performing songs initially recorded for the soundtrack of the movie of the same name. It was simultaneously released as a 78 rpm album set, Columbia C-198, and when Columbia finally began to release 45s about a year or so later it appeared as a boxed 45 rpm album set as Columbia B-198.
History and Provenance.
Although frequently identified as a "soundtrack," Columbia's "Young Man with a Horn" is not so in the literal sense. Columbia did not issue original soundtrack recordings at the time, and as both Day and James were Columbia contract artists they were obliged to re-record their selections from the movie for records, which they did in three sessions in Hollywood between January 25 and January 27, 1950. According to Billboard, on February 3 Columbia held an advance screening of the film in Hollywood, along with playback of the new record, for Columbia distributors and dealers, hosted by James and his wife, Betty Grable. Billboard prognosticated, "Disks will get heavy exploitation thru the pic tie-up coincidental to the film's general release," though there was in the end a bit of disconnect between the two products, as the film opened just a week later but Columbia's album wasn't ready for another month.
Reception.
Columbia's "Young Man with a Horn" was enormously successful commercially, spending 11 weeks at the No. 1 spot on Billboard's album charts, albeit non-consecutively. Day and James shared the 5 percent royalty for album sales; James did not appear in the film, but had dubbed all of Kirk Douglas' trumpet playing therein.
Track listing.
This album was expanded into a 12" version in 1954, Columbia CL 582, and currently available compact disc adding the following tracks:

Dorothy Wall

Dorothy Wall (12 January 1894 - 21 January 1942) was a New Zealand-born author and illustrator of children's fiction books. She is most famous for creating Blinky Bill, an anthropomorphic koala who was the central character in her books "Blinky Bill: the Quaint Little Australian" (1933), "Blinky Bill Grows Up" (1934) and "Blinky Bill and Nutsy" (1937). Most of her books were first published by Angus & Robertson.
Wall was born in Wellington, New Zealand on 12 January 1894 of English parents and won scholarships for her art at the age of 10. She migrated to Australia in 1914 and worked for the "Sun" newspaper in Sydney. In 1920 her first children's story "Tommy Bear and the Zookies" was published and the following year she married Andrew Delfosse Badgery. The same year Wall found some acclaim for her illustrations in J.J. Hall's book "The Crystal Bowl".
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s she continued to work as an illustrator. Her best known book "Blinky Bill: the Quaint Little Australian" was published in 1933. In 1934 she divorced Badgery and moved with her son to Warrimoo in the Blue Mountains where she completed two more Blinky Bill books, "Blinky Bill Grows Up" and "Blinky Bill and Nutsy". Despite Blinky Bill's popularity Wall experienced financial difficulties and was forced to fall back on her skills as an artist. Angus & Robertson, Ltd., her publishers at the time, provided her with work illustrating book jackets.
Suffering from depression, Bipolar disorder and with failing health, Wall returned to New Zealand in 1937 where she became an illustrator for the "New Zealand Herald" and the "Auckland Weekly News". Over the next few years both her health and her financial situation improved, aided no doubt by the publishing of "The Complete Adventures of Blinky Bill" in 1939. In July 1941 Wall moved back to Sydney and the country she loved so much, but her health quickly deteriorated and on 21 January 1942 she died of pneumonia at her home in Cremorne. She was buried in Northern Suburbs cemetery.
In 1985 a postage stamp honouring Wall or her creation, Blinky Bill, was issued by Australia Post as part of a set of five commemorating children's books. [http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0015510.jpg].

Lucas Jones

Lucas Jones ("né" Stansbury; formerly Spencer) is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, "General Hospital". Born onscreen in 1989, the character was played by several child actors, most notably by Justin Cooper from 1996 to 1998 and Logan O'Brien from 1998 to 2002. The character was rapidly aged in 2002 and Evan Bonifant took over the role briefly before he was replaced by C.J. Thomason who last appeared in 2003. The role was recast with Ryan Carnes in 2004. Carnes left the role in 2005, and was replaced by Ben Hogestyn. Hogestyn left the series in 2006. In late 2013, it was announced that Carnes would reprise the role in the new year.
Lucas is the adopted son of Dr. Tony Jones and his ex-wife, Bobbie Spencer, the biological son of crime lord Julian Jerome, and Cheryl Stansbury. As an infant, Lucas is at the center of a bitter custody battle between former friends, Bobbie and Tiffany Hill, Cheryl's sister. Under head writer, Robert Guza, Lucas is very close with his adoptive cousins, Maxie and Georgie Jones. In 2005, Lucas becomes the first character in the show's history to come out. After Tony's death in early 2006, Lucas, the character is written out. In 2013, Lucas becomes a subject of conversation again when it is revealed that Julian is actually alive, and he is contacted by his new found sister Sam for a DNA test.
Casting.
The role briefly played by Nicholas Moody in 1989 upon the character's onscreen birth. The role was portrayed by siblings, Kenny and Chuckie Gravino from 1992 to 1994. The Gravino siblings had previously appeared on "The Young and the Restless" as Phillip Chancellor IV. Jay Sacane appeared in the role from 1994 to 1996. Justin Cooper took over the role from 1996 to 1998. Logan O'Brien stepped into the role in August 1998. O'Brien left the series in 2002. Evan Bonifant stepped into the role on September 6, 2002, when the character was rapidly aged. Bonifant made is final appearance on December 18, and was quickly replaced by C.J. Thomason. Thomason made his debut on December 24, 2002. Thomason made his final appearance on June 11, 2003.
In 2004, the role was recast and Ryan Carnes stepped into the role. Ryan Carnes first auditioned for the role in May 2004. Carnes auditioned for a third time on June 2, 2004 and filmed his first scenes on June 16. At the time, Carnes was on vacation in Hawaii when he was called back to California for his final audition. However, his car broke down on the way to his audition. Fortunately, he was able to get a rid with his acting coach. After the audition, Carnes returned to his car and was forced wait another three to have his car towed. During his wait, Carnes learned he had booked the recurring role of Lucas with his first air date slated for July 8, 2004.
In 2005, it was announced Carnes would depart the series and would be replaced by Ben Hogestyn, just before Lucas revealed his sexuality. According to "TV Guide", Carnes was allegedly fearful of being typecast in gay roles, due to his previous work on television series, "Desperate Housewives" and the film "Eating Out". A representative for the actor claimed Carnes had already planned to leave the series due several upcoming gigs, but chose to vacate the role earlier before the series delved into Lucas's storyline instead of having the role recast in the middle of the story. Carnes last appeared on September 21, and Hogestyn stepped into the role on September 22. Hogestyn, who was only with the show on a recurring status, left in 2006 to pursue a full-time role on "The Bold and the Beautiful". According to then writer Dave Goldschmid, the role was supposed to be recast at some point, but the recast never happened.
In May 2013, "General Hospital Happenings" reported the producers had put out several casting calls, one of which was for the role of Lucas. In October 2013, "SoapZone.com" reported the role had been cast and the new hire was a "hot commodity." The casting call, which lasted for several months was reportedly cancelled in mid November 2013. Starting on December 4, 2013, through "Twitter", Ryan Carnes began referencing various locations with the word "Port" in the names. In December 2013, executive producer, Frank Valentini confirmed to "Soaps In Depth" that Ryan Carnes would reprise the role of Lucas. Following the announcement, Carnes updated his "Twitter" with the simple message: "Ah, Port Charles, it is!"
Carnes filmed his first return scenes on December 11, 2013. Carnes first episode was slated for January 16, 2014, but was pushed back to January 17 due to news coverage. In response to bringing Carnes back to the role, Valentini said it was important to maintain continuity of who had previously played Lucas. Valentini contacted Carnes after casting director Mark Teschner sent him Carnes's audition reel. Head writer, Ron Carlivati said he was the most familiar face, and he also shared a resemblance to William DeVry, who played Julian, "and it just made sense."
Carnes said he was quite shocked by the offer to reprise the role. A friend of Ryan Carnes', who was also a fan of the show saw the onscreen events on unfolding and told Carnes that he excepted Lucas was coming back to the canvas. The casting department contacted Carnes's agent by email and asked if he was interested.
Development.
Teen years (2002–06).
From 2002 to 2006, Lucas is integrated into a group of younger characters which consist of his adoptive cousins, Maxie (Robyn Richards) and Georgie (Lindze Letherman). Lucas (Thomason) and Georgie even dated briefly in high school, and he took her to prom only for Maxie to ruin their date. Though they were not biologically related, neither pairing caught on with fans. Lucas (Carnes) later dated Brook Lynn Ashton (Adrianne León) while he supported Georgie during her troubled romance with Dillon Quartermaine (Scott Clifton). In late August 2005, "TV Guide" revealed the series had planned a Coming out story for the character of Lucas. With the announcement of Carnes's departure shortly after, a rep said the storyline would be a main focus that would affect the entire canvas. On October 11, 2005 (National Coming Out Day), Lucas announces to Georgie he is gay. The storyline is dropped due to Hogestyn's departure and Lucas is written off canvas in early 2006.
Return (2014).
In July 2013, "General Hospital Happenings" reported that Zeman's next visit as Bobbie would bring Lucas home. Though it had yet to be mentioned onscreen, the website said Lucas was now a doctor, and with a recommendation from Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom), he transfers to "General Hospital". He was also rumored to share a past with Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). Despite no confirmation from the series, "Instinct" published a report which stated Lucas had attended medical school in Seattle. The character's return also brings attention to the ongoing mob storyline which features Lucas's former brother-in-law Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and his biological family the Jeromes. In the fall of 2013, Lucas agrees to a DNA test which proves he and Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) are paternal half-siblings. Later, an angry Sam accidentally mentions Lucas to Julian (William DeVry), prompting Julian to look into their connection.
Ron Carlivati said bringing back the character of Lucas became necessary when William deVry took over the role of Julian. They stuck with the original onscreen events, in which Julian never learns of Lucas's existence. Carlivati said Lucas is a very "central character" because he is related to majority of the canvas. In an interview with Michael Fairman of "On-Air On-Soaps", Carnes said that Lucas feels a bit out of place and knowing Tony always accepted him, Lucas goes to the cemetery to "commune with his spirit." However, according to Carnes, finding Julian, his biological father, in the place where he visits the only father he's ever know, sets up an "instant conclift." So the confrontation is already happening occurring on "shaky ground." In an interview with "Soap Opera Digest", Carnes said that Lucas is "quite comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality." However, discovering that Julian is alive is an "emotional upheaval," Carnes said. Telling Julian that he is gay is Lucas's way of testing Julian, "to see what he's made of." Despite Lucas being very sure of himself, Lucas views Julian's "lack of support," as "rejection." Lucas struggles with Julian's reaction and "spirals a bit," Carnes said. The actor looked forward to seeing how the "human situation" between Julian and Lucas would develop, it would help those who could identify with the situation.
Romances (2014–).
According to Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman), as of 2013, Lucas resides in Seattle, Washington and had still not found the right guy. The character's return sets up a romantic triangle between Lucas, Felix DuBois (Marc Anthony Samuel) and Brad Cooper (Parry Shen). In an interview with "On-Air On-Soaps" published on December 26, 2013, Carlivati confirmed that Lucas would definitely become a factor in the budding relationship between Brad and Felix. When it comes to Lucas and Brad, Carnes said, "how many times do we meet people who really and truly can understand our unique life experience, and get us on so many levels, and particularly, with these guys whose biological fathers are gangsters, and they're gay, they have to deal with acceptance and non-acceptance of their sexuality with their families." The "extremely unique" set of circumstances makes Lucas and Brad, "kindred spirits."
On January 28, 2014, ABC Daytime sent a press release which revealed that Lucas accepts Felix's invite to go out on Valentine's Day. Carnes remained tight lipped on how Lucas ends up going on a date with Felix, but maintained that Lucas and Brad have a real connection.

Reception.
Following Hogestyn's sudden departure, many fans were left wondering what happened to the character. Former "GH" writer, Dave Goldschmid described the fan response to Lucas "coming out" as "heartwarmingly positive."
In April 2013,"Soaps In Depth" described Hogestyn's portrayal of Lucas as "sensitive," and suggested Hogestyn along with Zack Conroy, Van Hansis and Shawn Pyfrom would all be a good fit for the role of Lucas. In November 2010, Jamey Giddens also pushed for the character's return with Hansis in the role, thinking the soap could capitalize on the actor's huge fan base from "As the World Turns".
Fan were thrilled by the announced of Carnes's return. Jillian Bowe said "Who Will Ryan Carnes Be Eating Out as General Hospital's Lucas?" referencing Carnes's role in the gay romantic comedy. Many expected the announcement due to heavy references of the character onscreen. With the announcement of Carnes's return, TheBacklot.com said the character's return couldn't come soon enough. Errol Lewis of "Soap Opera Network" commented the character's return would allow for the existing gay characters to step out of their supporting roles, and would also bring a lot of media attention to the series like the pairing of Will and Sonny did for NBC's "Days of our Lives". "Instinct" magazine said "Lucas's return to the hospital-based soap is just what the doctor ordered!" Greg Hernandez said Carnes's return was enough to make him watch "General Hospital" on the daily basis. "Soaps In Depth" pushed for Lucas to be paired with Felix in April 2013 and even gave the potential pairing the nickname, "Lulix."

Jennings Carmichael

Jennings Carmichael (24 February 1868 – 9 February 1904) was an Australian poet.
The daughter of Archibald Carmichael, Grace Elizabeth Jennings Carmichael was born at East Ballarat in 1868. She was educated at Melbourne, while still a child went to live on a station at Orbost, and grew up close to the bush she came to love so much. In 1888 she went to Melbourne to be trained as a nurse at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and in 1891 published a small volume of prose sketches, "Hospital Children". Having qualified she obtained a position on a station near Geelong, and subsequently married Francis Mullis. She contributed verse to the "Australasian", and in 1895 "Poems" by Jennings Carmichael was published. She lived for a time in South Australia and then went to London, where she died in poor circumstances in 1904. In 1910 a small selection of her poems was published, in 1937 a plaque to her memory was unveiled at Orbost, and a year later a replica was placed in the public library at Ballarat. Two of Jennings Carmichael's sons were present at the ceremony.
Jennings Carmichael wrote much good and pleasant verse with occasional touches of poetry. Brunton Stephens called Miss Carmichael the Jean Ingelow of Australia. Comparisons of this kind have little value, but it may be said that Miss Carmichael's position in relation to the leading Australian poets, is not dissimilar to that of Miss Ingelow in comparison with Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson.

Young Man with a Horn (film)

Young Man with a Horn is a 1950 musical drama film based on a novel of the same name by Dorothy Baker inspired by the life of
Bix Beiderbecke, the jazz cornetist. The movie stars Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Doris Day, and Hoagy Carmichael, and was directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Jerry Wald. The screenplay was written by Carl Foreman and Edmund H. North.
Plot.
As a young boy, after his mother dies, Rick Martin sees a trumpet in the window of a pawn shop. He works in a bowling alley to save up enough money to buy it.
Rick grows up to be an outstanding musician, tutored by jazzman Art Hazzard. He lands a job playing for the big band of Jack Chandler, getting to know the piano player Smoke Willoughby and the beautiful singer Jo Jordan.
Chandler orders him to always play the music exactly as written. Rick prefers to improvise, and one night, during a break with Chandler's band, he leads an impromptu jam session, which gets him fired.
Jo has fallen for Rick and finds him a job in New York with a dance orchestra. One night, her friend Amy North accompanies her to hear Rick play. Amy, studying to be a psychiatrist, is a complicated young woman still disturbed by her own mother's suicide. She claims to be incapable of feeling love, but she and Rick begin an affair and eventually are married.
Rarely together at the same time because of the hours they keep, Rick and Amy constantly quarrel. She fails in her attempt to become a doctor and takes it out on Rick, demanding a divorce. He begins drinking and his mood deteriorates to the point that one day he even takes it out on Art Hazzard, a man who had done so much for him. Before Rick can apologize, Art is hit by a car and killed.
Rick becomes an alcoholic who neglects his music and even destroys his horn. He disappears, until one day Smoke finds him in a drunk tank. Jo is contacted and rushes to Rick's side, helping him to recover his love of music and of her—a happy ending 
found neither in the novel nor in the life of Bix Beiderbecke.
Cast.
As of June 21, 2014, with Kirk Douglas at 97, Lauren Bacall at 89, and Doris Day at 92, the 1950 "Young Man with a Horn" is possibly the oldest film with its three leading players, all major stars, still living.
Production notes.
Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke. Famed trumpeter Harry James performed the music Kirk Douglas is shown playing on screen.
Reception.
According to "The New York Times", "banalities of the script are quite effectively glossed over in the slick pictorial smoothness of Michael Curtiz's direction and the exciting quality of the score. The result is that there is considerable good entertainment in "Young Man With a Horn" despite the production's lack of balance." In spite of the screenplay, the "Times" praised the performances of Kirk Douglas, Doris Day and Hoagy Carmichael, but noted "the unseen star of the picture is Harry James, the old maestro himself, who supplies the tingling music which flows wildly, searchingly and forlornly from Rick Martin's beloved horn. This is an instance where the soundtrack is more than a complementary force. It is the very soul of the picture because if it were less provocative and compelling the staleness of the drama could be stultifying."

Stu Bergman

Stu Bergman was a fictional character in the now-cancelled American soap opera, "Search for Tomorrow". The part was played for almost all of the show's 35 years by the late Larry Haines.
Jo's best friend.
Stu lived in the fictional community of Henderson with his wife, Marge (Melba Rae), and his children Janet and later, their son, Tommy (played famously by John James and Robert LuPone). 
They were next-door neighbors and best friends of the recently widowed Joanne Gardner. The Bergmans always were able to bring a smile to Jo's face, whenever she needed their advice, or good cheer.
Just as Jo and Marge were best friends, their daughters, Janet and Patti, also became best friends. Stu and Marge were together for almost twenty years when in 1971, she died. (Since actress Melba Rae, who played Marge had just died too, the character was not recast).
Because the house had too many memories of Marge, Stu and Tommy moved in with Janet and her new husband, Wade Collins (John Cunningham). Jo and Stu remained best friends and cronies afterwards. 
Stu eventually got over his grief for Marge and married a woman named Ellie Harper (Billie Lou Watt). She proved to be a great wife to Stu for a long time, but she eventually ran off with the temperamental chef at the Hartford House, the inn that he and Jo ran together. He had enjoyed a relationship with one Dr. Barbara Moreno (Olympia Dukakis) for a time, since he was friends with her son, Joshua & daughter, Angela. Much later, he had a romance with a songstress named Wilma Holliday (Anita Gillette) but that ended when she went back to her husband David Glenn (Jack Betts). 
Stu and Jo were related as her father, Frank Gardner, had married his widowed mother. They were step-siblings, but they truly cared for one another. He was also the grandfather of Gary Walton (Rick Lohman); Liza Walton Sentell; and Danny Walton (Cain DeVore); their father was the late Dr. Dan Walton, Janet's third husband. During the Travis and Liza storyline, Stu was tied into it, as Liza was his granddaughter; and Martin Tourneur, Travis's uncle was married to Jo.
In 1985, several things happened to Stu: he, Jo and Sarah, Jo's granddaughter opened up a bed and breakfast building called The Caldwell House. His grandson Danny Walton (John Loprieno) came back to Henderson from California. Stu was a victim of the Henderson Serial Killer: Alberto Rivera (Lloyd Battista); he fell down the stairs, but he survived the latest attack from the killer. He was very lucky to have survived because the killer had already killed Sarah Whitting, Jo's granddaughter and was going to kill Stephanie Wyatt in February 1986.
In January 1986, Stu decided to go on vacation to Florida, where his relatives were at the time. But a few weeks later (that February) he came back when the town was washed away in a flood that nearly destroyed Henderson. The flood had washed away many buildings & many survived the flood but many others were missing or were dead. The Caldwell House suffered damage but was still intact; Stu then was concerned when he realized that Liza, Lloyd, The Kendalls and Danny were all missing. He eventually was reunited with all of them and was devastated to learn that Liza was about to separate with Lloyd, who has gone back to his ex-wife, Estelle. He also learned that Robert Olsen the person who was an a employee who managed an apartment building that has been remodeled and renovated prior to the flood, gave an offer to Jo that she couldn't refuse, to manage the apartment building that was dubbed by the remaining town residents calling it, "The Liberty House". Then, he and Jo decided not to have the Caldwell House anymore - instead they created another new bed-and-breakfast (replacing Caldwell House) with "Liberty House". He also moved into the Liberty House with the residents of Henderson, his family & friends who had no place to go home to after the flood. 
In the last episode, after Stu and Jo had been at her daughter Patti's wedding to Hogan McCleary, Jo was looking up at the sky, and Stu, who had been through it all with Jo, asked what she was searching for. She replied, "Tomorrow, and I can't wait!" Then the two long-time best friends hugged.
During his time on "Search for Tomorrow", Larry Haines, who played Stu, teamed up again with Rick Lohman, who played his grandson, Gary Walton, to play in-laws on the short lived sitcom, "Phyl and Mikhy". 
Larry played the father in-law, Max Wilson, a University track coach, and Rick played Mikhail "Mikhy" Orloff, a track star from Russia who was married his daughter, Phyllis (Murphy Cross). The language barrier was bad for Mikhy, who, unfortunately for him, his Russian accent made the word "Dad" sound like "dead", to Max's dismay.

In this episode, the "Defiant" answers a call for help from a stranded Starfleet officer, while back at the station, Quark attempts to distract Odo so that he can conduct a smuggling operation.
Plot.
While traveling home from an escort mission, the crew of the USS "Defiant" receive a distress call from Captain Lisa Cusak (voiced by Debra Wilson), a Starfleet officer stranded on an alien world by herself, after her ship has been destroyed by actively scanning a strange planet. After working a means to communicate with her, they discover that she is stranded on a Class L world with a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that will eventually kill her without regular doses of "triox" medication, which she is running out of. Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig) tells her to cut her dose such that she will survive the six days that it will take the "Defiant" to reach the planet. In turn, Captain Cusak asks that they keep a constant conversation going with her to keep her alert and to make her feel less isolated.
As they travel, each of the crew becomes closer to Captain Cusak as they discuss their own personal problems with her. When Dr. Bashir discovers that Cusak's supply of triox is more critical than they thought, Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks) orders the phaser bank power to be routed to structural stability controls to increase the "Defiant"'s speed. They arrive at the planet shortly after Cusak has fallen unconscious, giving them a limited amount of time to find her. After figuring out how to bypass a strange energy field that surrounds the planet with a shuttlecraft, the crew finds the long-decomposed remains of Cusak's body deep in a cave, having been dead for about three years. O'Brien (Colm Meaney) theorizes that the energy field caused their communications to travel through time. Sisko orders them to collect Cusak's body and gives her a proper burial back on "Deep Space Nine" as a Starfleet officer and trusted friend.
Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) talks Odo (René Auberjonois) into preparing an extravagant celebration to end his first month with Major Kira (Nana Visitor). He tells Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton), who is writing a story about criminals, that while Odo is occupied he will sell rare crystals for profit. However, Odo decides to change his romantic evening for the following night, ruining Quark's plan. Taking pity on him, Odo decides to let him off this one time and has his evening with Kira when he originally planned.

Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)

Mid and West Wales is an electoral region of the National Assembly for Wales, consisting of eight constituencies. The region elects twelve members, eight directly elected constituency members and four additional members. The electoral region was first used in the 1999 Welsh Assembly election, when the National Assembly for Wales was created.
Each constituency elects one Assembly Member by the first past the post electoral system, and the region as a whole elects four additional or top-up Assembly Members, to create a degree of proportional representation. The additional member seats are allocated from closed lists by the d'Hondt method, with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.
County and Westminster boundaries.
As created in 1999, the region covered the whole of the preserved county of Dyfed, most of the preserved county of Powys and parts of the preserved counties of Clwyd and Gwynedd. Other parts of Powys, Clwyd and Gwynedd were within the North Wales electoral region.
For the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, however boundaries changed, and the region now covers all of the preserved county of Dyfed, all of the preserved county of Powys and part of the preserved county of Gwynedd. The rest of Gwynedd is in the North Wales region.
The constituencies have the names and boundaries of constituencies of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster). For Westminster election purposes, however, there are no electoral regions, and constituency boundary changes became effective for the 2010 United Kingdom general election.
Electoral region profile.
The region is geographically the largest of the five electoral regions in Wales, being larger in area than the other four regions combined. It consists almost entirely of sparsely populated rural areas, with the exception of the mining town of Llanelli in the south. The Welsh language is widely spoken.

Mark Suppelsa

Mark Eugene Suppelsa (born June 25, 1962 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is a journalist, who presently works as an anchor and reporter for WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois. Suppelsa currently serves as the co-anchor of the "WGN Evening News" from 5-6 p.m. with Lourdes Duarte and the station's long-running primetime newscast "WGN News at Nine" with Micah Materre. He was also the news anchor on WTMX-FM's "Eric and Kathy Morning Show". 
Early life and education.
Born in Milwaukee, Suppelsa moved with his family to Libertyville, Illinois in 1972, and then moved to Frankfort, Illinois in 1978. He graduated from Lincoln-Way High School in New Lenox, Illinois in 1980, according to an article in the Chicago Tribune that appeared on September 26, 1993. Suppelsa graduated from Marquette University with a degree in journalism in 1984. He also had worked as a disc jockey for the campus radio station and had written for the school paper.
"I enjoyed the story," Suppelsa told the Chicago Tribune in an article that ran on June 29, 1997. "And something just hooked me. The deadlines, the writing, the video, the shooting it, the editing it. It all just swept me away."
During Suppelsa's final year of college, he worked over the holidays at WAOW-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin.
Professional career.
Suppelsa's first job out of college was at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he became an anchor after six months on the job. In 1987, Suppelsa took a job at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, where he worked as an anchor and a reporter.
In July 1993, Suppelsa joined WMAQ-TV in Chicago as a weekend anchor and reporter. He later became a late afternoon and early evening news anchor. In May 1997, Suppelsa memorably sparred with talk-show host Jerry Springer during WMAQ's 10 p.m. newscast, shortly after Springer resigned after a brief, controversial run as a commentator.
In March 2003, Suppelsa quit WMAQ-TV to join WFLD-TV in Chicago as a reporter, fill-in anchor and investigative reporter. In September 2004, WFLD promoted Suppelsa to be the co-anchor of WFLD's "Fox News Chicago at Nine" in Chicago, at the same time demoting Walter Jacobson from the co-anchor position.
On March 10, 2008, Suppelsa chose not to renew his contract with WFLD-TV. Suppelsa reportedly turned down a contract offer from Channel 32 that would have cut his salary by about 15 percent. Once the 90-day "right to match" clause in Suppelsa's old contract expired, he became free to announce a new job in TV. He signed a contract deal with WGN-TV to anchor the 9 pm news replacing Steve Sanders (who now anchors the midday newscast from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.). Sanders replaced Tom Negovan who became a full-time general assignment reporter and back-up anchor for all WGN newscasts.
Suppelsa also formerly worked as a morning news anchor on the Eric and Kathy Show on WTMX-FM radio in Chicago. He says it was truly one of the most enjoyable highlights of his working time in Chicago...except for the 4:25am alarm clock each morning. He says, he quit the radio show in October 2010 because it was simply too many duties to handle in a day after he convinced WGN-TV to hire away his prized investigative producer to work on stories for television.
Personal.
Suppelsa met his wife, Candus, while working in Minneapolis in 1988, according to a Chicago Tribune article that appeared on June 29, 1997. Today, Mark and Candus live in Evanston, Illinois with their two children. Suppelsa also is a vegetarian, according to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times on September 7, 2004.
Suppelsa is a Facebook and Twitter user and is usually logged on during broadcasts. He frequently updates his status and chat with fans and friends while on the air.
On May 4, 2012, Suppelsa announced that he would be taking a break from his job at WGN to enter a monthlong alcohol rehabilitation program.

South Wales Central (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)

South Wales Central is an electoral region of the National Assembly for Wales, consisting of eight constituencies. The region elects 12 members, eight directly elected constituency members and four additional members. The electoral region was first used in 1999, when the Assembly for Wales was created.
Each constituency elects one Assembly Member by the first past the post electoral system, and the region as a whole elects four additional or top-up Assembly Members, to create a degree of proportional representation. The additional member seats are allocated from closed lists by the d'Hondt method, with constituency results reckoned as pre elected list members.
County boundaries.
The region covers much of the preserved county of Mid Glamorgan and much of the preserved county of South Glamorgan. The rest of Mid Glamorgan is partly within the South Wales East electoral region and partly within the South Wales West. The rest of South Glamorgan is within the South Wales West electoral region.
Electoral region profile.
The region is predominantly urban, taking in Wales' capital and largest city, Cardiff, as well as the working-class former mining town of Pontypridd, the seaside resort of Barry, and parts of the formerly industrial and still heavily populated South Wales Valleys. However, the region also includes rural areas in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan.

Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park

Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park is a national park in Sumatra, Indonesia. The park located along the Bukit Barisan mountain range, has a total area of 3,568 km², and spans three provinces: Lampung, Bengkulu, and South Sumatra. Together with Gunung Leuser and Kerinci Seblat national parks it forms a World Heritage Site, Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra.
Flora and fauna.
The national park stretching along the Bukit Barisan mountain range is in average only 45 km wide but 350 km long. The northern part is mountainous with its highest point at Gunung Pulung (1,964 m), while its southern section is a peninsula. It is covered by montane forest, lowland tropical forest, coastal forest and mangrove forest.
Plants in the park include Nipa palm, "Casuarina equisetifolia", "Anisoptera curtisii" and "Gonystylus bancanus", as well as Sonneratia, Pandanus, Shorea and Dipterocarpus species. Large flowers in the park include the "Rafflesia arnoldii", "Amorphophallus decus-silvae", "Amorphophallus titanum" and the world's largest orchid the "Grammatophyllum speciosum".
The park is home to many endangered species, including: 
Other animals in the park are the Malayan tapir, siamang, Sumatran surili, sun bear and lesser mouse-deer. There are over 300 species of bird in the park.
Conservation and threats.
The area was first protected by the Dutch East Indies government in 1935, that declared the South Sumatra I Nature Reserve.
The area became a National Park in 1982.
Since the 1970s there have been numerous squatters established within the park, and despite forced evictions in the early 1980s, their numbers increased since 1998. In 2006 it was estimated that the squatter encroachment by about 127,000 people covered an area of 55,000 ha. For the period between 1972 and 2006, it is estimated that 63,000 ha of primary forest cover has been lost. This represents 20% of the forests lost to illegal agriculture. The World Wide Fund for Nature found that more than 450 km² of park land is being used for growing coffee, and the organisation is now working with multinational coffee companies to help them avoid buying illegally grown coffee.

Gyland

Gyland is a village and a former municipality in Vest-Agder county in Norway. It is located in the northeastern part of the present-day municipality of Flekkefjord between the municipality of Kvinesdal and the lake, Sirdalsvatnet.
Name.
The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old "Gyland" farm (Old Norse: "Gýjuland"), where the church is located. The first element is the old name of the river that flows past the farm (Old Norse: "Gýja" or "Gý") and the last elemant is "land" which means "land".
History.
Gyland was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but it was almost immediately merged into neighboring Bakke municipality in the fall of 1839. The area of Gyland (population: 1,085) was separated (again) from Bakke on 31 December 1893.
On 1 January 1965, the municipalities of Gyland, Bakke, Hidra, and Nes were merged with the town of Flekkefjord to form a new, larger municipality of Flekkefjord. Prior to the merger Gyland had a population of 691.

The Laughing Place

The Laughing Place is a traditional African American folktale, featuring Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. It is famous for its inclusion among Joel Chandler Harris' "Uncle Remus" stories.
Summary.
Following Br'er Rabbit's capture, the hero leads his captors, wily Br'er Fox and dim-witted Br'er Bear, to his "laughin' place". Out of curiosity, they let him lead the way, only for Br'er Rabbit to walk them straight into a cavern of bees. While the antagonists are stung, Br'er Rabbit escapes. 
This story can be traced to African trickster tales, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in Western Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider (see Anansi), though the plots of tales of the spider are often identical with those of stories of Br'er Rabbit.
In popular culture.
The story was used in the movie "Song of the South" along with "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch". It is also referenced in a dark ride scene of Splash Mountain, a log flume-style attraction at Disneyland, Orlando's Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, based on "Song of the South".

Richard Kelley

Richard Kelley (24 July 1904 – April 1984) was a British trade unionist and left-wing Labour Party politician from the coal mining area of Doncaster. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Don Valley from 1959 to 1979.
Career.
Kelley was a miners' union secretary in Doncaster for 10 years, where he joined with National Coal Board managers in opposition to miners who wanted to leave work early when their work was complete, fearing that it could lead to miners hurrying their work and ignoring safety precautions. He also served as a councillor on the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council from 1949 to 1959.
He was elected at the 1959 general election as the MP for Don Valley, and held the seat at five further general elections until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1979 general election. Kelley was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and was one of the MPs affected by a decision in 1977 of the Yorkshire area of the NUM to seek the retirement at age 65 of all MPs sponsored by mining unions.
In Parliament.
In February 1961, the German Democratic Republic's news agency ADN reported that Kelley had been "harassed", "threatened" and then arrested by police in West Berlin whilst visiting the city in connection with his attendance at a conference for coexistence and disarmament in Warsaw. The West Berlin authorities dismissed the claims, describing the incident as "trivial". In June of that year, Kelley's son Jack, then aged 23, was fined £1 for painting the slogan "ban the bomb" on a bus shelter near Doncaster, but said "it has nothing to do with my father".
Kelley opposed the Vietnam War. In March 1967 he signed an advertisement in "The Times" calling on the government of the United Kingdom to "dissociate itself explicitly from the bombing of North Vietnam", and in April that year he was one of 59 Labour MPs to vote against the Labour government in a Commons motion on the war. He rebelled against the incomes policy of Harold Wilson's government, voting against the government in a division on the report stage of the Prices and Incomes Bill in June 1968, and voted against the government again in a further motion on Vietnam in December 1969.
In November 1976, Kelley was one of 33 Labour MPs denounced by the Social Democratic Alliance (a pressure group on the right of the Labour Party) for their alleged associations with Communist and Trotskyite organisations. The MPs, who included Tony Benn and future leader Michael Foot, were accused by the SDA of being part of a shift in the party "in favour of intolerant Marxist totalitarianism".

Ernest Hutcheson

Ernest Hutcheson (20 July 1871 - 9 February 1951) was an Australian pianist, composer and teacher.
Hutcheson was born in Melbourne, and toured there as a child prodigy. He later travelled to Leipzig and entered the Leipzig Conservatorium at the age of fourteen to study with Carl Reinecke and Bernhard Stavenhagen, a pupil of Franz Liszt. He was part of the London music circuit in 1896 and 1897. Prior to the outbreak of World War I he taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, but in 1914 he settled in New York, where he made his U.S. debut. He is believed to have been the first pianist to play three concertos in a single concert: his performances of Beethoven's third, fourth and fifth with the New York Symphony Orchestra in the Aeolian Hall in 1919. 
He became a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School, and successively Dean (1926–1937) and President (1937–1945) of the school.
Hutcheson wrote an important book called "The Literature of the Piano", and taught many first-rate students. One of these many students was Mary Ann Craft, who later taught the prodigy Edgar Coleman during his formative years. Two other students who went on to important pianistic careers were the American Abram Chasins, and the Australian Bruce Hungerford. Hutcheson was a member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity.
Hutcheson was also associated with the Chautauqua School of Music at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York State. Hutcheson provided a much needed refuge for George Gershwin at Chautauqua during the stressful period of composing and refining the Piano Concerto in F. Since Gershwin was already very famous as a successful writer of popular works and musical shows, he was constantly besieged by admirers. Further, he had never scored a large symphonic work (the earlier "Rhapsody in Blue" had been scored for jazz band by Gershwin, but was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé) and was under great stress from the pressing deadline expectations from Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony, who had commissioned the Concerto in F. Thanks to Ernest Hutcheson's kind offer of seclusion for Gershwin at Chautauqua where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily, Gershwin was able to successfully complete his piano concerto on time.
Ernest Hutcheson wrote concertos for piano; 2 pianos; and violin, and many solo piano works, such as a transcription of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries". His music has been little heard in concert or on recordings, but his Australian compatriot Ian Munro has recorded some of his piano pieces.

The field is in the Calvert family colors and design, which also appear in the first and fourth quarters of the Maryland state flag.
The flag is blazoned as follows: Paly of six Or and sable, a bend counterchanged, on an inescutcheon Sable, within an orle of the first, a representation of Baltimore's Battle Monument Argent. Two other designs were submitted for consideration; both included the battle monument and the Calvert arms.

Royal Devon Yeomanry

The Royal Devon Yeomanry was a Yeomanry regiment of the British Army, formed in 1920. It participated in World War II and now forms a squadron of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry.
Antecendents.
Following the experience of the First World War, it was decided that only the fourteen most senior yeomanry regiments would be retained as horsed cavalry, with the rest being transferred to other roles. As a result, on 7 June 1920, the Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry was amalgamated with the Royal North Devon Yeomanry to form the Royal Devon Yeomanry and simultaneously transferred to the Royal Artillery to form 11th (Devon) Army Brigade, RFA.
Pre war.
The brigade / regiment underwent a number of redesignations before the outbreak of World War II. In 1921 it was renumbered and regained its yeomanry title as 96th (Devon Yeomanry) Army Brigade, RFA and in 1922 became 96th (Devonshire Yeomanry) Army Brigade, RFA. In 1923 it regained its royal title as 96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Brigade, RFA. Another title change came in 1924 as the Royal Field Artillery was reamalgamated back into the Royal Artillery and the regiment became 96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Brigade, RA. The final change came in 1938 as artillery brigades became regiments, hence 96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA. In 1939, the Territorial Army was duplicated - existing units formed a second unit. 96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA formed 142nd (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA.
World War II.
Field regiments were organised in 1938 into two 12-gun batteries. The experience of the BEF in 1940 showed the problem with this organisation: field regiments were intended to support an infantry brigade of three battalions. This could not be managed without severe disruption to the regiment. As a result, field regiments were reorganised into three 8-gun batteries. 
96th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA.
96th Field Regiment served in the Home Forces for most of the war, moving to India in January 1945. 
At the outbreak of the war, 96th Field Regiment was part of 45th Division. Initially commanding two batteries - 381 from Torverton and 382 from Totnes - the third battery (469) was formed in the regiment at Knottingley in December 1940.
It transferred to 61st Division in June 1944 before being posted to India. In the Far East, it supported 81st (West Africa) Division and 25th Indian Division in preparation for Operation Zipper.
142nd (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA.
142nd Field Regiment also initially served in the Home Forces, before moving to Sicily and Italy from July 1943. 
At the outbreak of the war, 142nd Field Regiment was also part of 45th Division. Initially commanding two batteries - 383 from Torrington and 384 from South Molton - the third battery (506) was formed in the regiment at Bircotes on 5 November 1940. It was authorised to use the "Royal Devon Yeomanry" designation from 17 February 1942.
142nd Field Regiment fought in Sicily from July 1943 and in Italy thereafter under command of 8th Army, taking part in most of the major actions of that campaign including the landings in Sicily and Anzio and the Battle of Monte Cassino. Throughout the campaign the regiment was armed with Bishop self-propelled guns. For its support to the Canadian Division it was awarded the right to wear the Maple Leaf of Canada.
Post war.
Both regiments were reformed in 1947 as 296th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA (at Exeter) and 342nd (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, RA. In 1950, 342nd Medium Regiment was amalgamed into 296th Field Regiment and in 1956 absorbed
256th (Wessex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. 296th Field Regiment survived until 1967.
On 1 April 1967 the regiment was amalgamated with the 4th Battalion, The Devonshire Regiment to form The Devonshire Territorials (Royal Devon Yeomanry/The 1st Rifle Volunteers). In the process it was reduced to squadron strength as "A" Squadron. This had a brief, two year, existence and throughout that time was kept very short of equipment and training time. It was reduced to cadre in 1969.
With a change of government policy, in 1971 the Territorials were again reformed, and on 1 April a new regiment was born incorporating three old and distinguished cavalry regiments. "A" and "C" Squadrons were formed from the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, "B" Squadron from the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, and "D" Squadron from the old Royal Devon Yeomanry. The regiment is called the Royal Wessex Yeomanry.
The Royal Devon Yeomanry now serves as D Squadron, Royal Wessex Yeomanry based in North Devon (Barnstaple) and South Devon (Paignton). It provides trained replacement crewmen for the Regular Army's Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank.
The Royal Devon Yeomanry Museum is incorporated in the North Devon Museum, The Square Barnstaple.

Shepherdswell

Shepherdswell (also Sibertswold) is a village in Kent, England, UK. It is notable for the East Kent Railway, whose terminus is sited there. This was originally one of Colonel Stephens' lines and ran to Wingham. The section as far as Eythorne is now run by a preservation society. 
The village social life centres around the local Grade I listed church 'Church of St Andrew', and the village hall, which is host to a number of events including regular charity jumble sales and a pre-school playgroup.
Currently the village has a thriving "pub" scene with two very different establishments. The Grade II listed Bell by the village green, near to the church and the (also grade II listed) Bricklayers Arms along Eythorne Road. Part of the Shepherd Neame Brewery franchise.
Additionally the village has a mini-supermarket and Post Office.
The town is also on the Miner's Way Trail. The trail links up the coalfield parishes of East Kent. In the town it also links with the North Downs Way, which also passes through the town between Whitfield and Woolage Village.
Sport.
Shepherdswell is also home the "Shepherdswell Spartans Football Club". Football has been played in the village of Shepherdswell for at least 98 years. Originally the team was called Shepherdswell FC and played from about 1908 until 1965; the name of the next major club in the village was the Whitehall Spartans, who played for most of the 1970s; they would become responsible for the name of today's current team. In 1983–84, a team managed by Jim Osborne was formed again and named after their then sponsors A1 Taxis which entered the Dover District Sunday League. By the start of the next season their name had reverted to something more recognisable as the main team in the village – Shepherdswell Spartans was born. They took the name Spartans from the local pub The Whitehall Inn which was their social base until the pub was shut down in 1989.
Today the team is still going strong and has their social base as The Bricklayers Arms where they can be found on a Sunday afternoon either toasting their victories or drowning their sorrows in defeat.
As well as a Sunday League football team, Shepherdswell is home to a cricket team known simply as "Shepherdswell C.C." The team plays "friendly" village fixtures from May to September each year against other teams from all over the county of Kent.
Both the football and cricket teams can be seen playing on the picturesque Shepherdswell Recreation Ground ("The Rec'") and during the months of August and September sports fans will be able to watch football in the morning (10:30 am kick-off) followed by cricket in the afternoon (13:30 pm start).

Nord-Varanger

Nord-Varanger is a former municipality in Finnmark county in Norway. It is located in the present-day Vadsø Municipality on the southern half of the Varanger Peninsula, east of the Jakobselva river, along the Varangerfjorden.
Name.
The meaning of the name Nord-Varanger is originally the name of the Varangerfjorden, (Old Norse: "Ver(j)angr"). The first part is "ver" meaning "fishing village" and the last part is "angr" which means "fjord". It was first probably used for the narrow fjord on the inside of Angsnes which now is called "Meskfjorden" and leads in to Varangerbotn. "Nord" means "north", therefore it is the north side of the Varangerfjord.
History.
The "kjøpstad" (market town) of Vadsø was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). Because of the low population in the rural area around the town, the municipality originally included the rural area around it. That rural area was known as the "Vadsø landsogn". On 1 January 1894, "Vadsø landsogn" was separated from the town of Vadsø and became the new municipality called "Nord-Varanger". Nord-Varanger had an initial population of 1,296. On 1 January 1964 during a time of many municipal mergers nationwide, Nord-Varanger (population: 1,587) was merged back together with the town of Vadsø to create the present-day Vadsø Municipality.

Juraj Križanić

Juraj Križanić (c. 1618 – September 12, 1683), also known as Yuriy Krizhanich or Iurii Krizhanich (), was a Croatian Catholic missionary who is often regarded as the earliest recorded pan-Slavist.
Biography.
Early life, education, and early missionary work.
Križanić was born in Obrh, near Ozalj (in present-day Croatia) in 1618, a period of political turmoil and of Turkish invasions into Croatia. He attended a Jesuit grammar school in Ljubljana and a Jesuit gymnasium in Zagreb from 1629 to 1635. His father died when he was 17 years old, at approximately the same time he graduated from the gymnasium. He began attending the University of Bologna in 1638 to study theology and graduated in 1640. Shortly after graduating Križanić began attending the Greek College of St. Athanasius, a center in Rome for the training of Catholic missionaries who would work with Orthodox Christians, from which he graduated in 1642. By the end of his life he was proficient in ten languages. While Križanić had a strong desire to travel to Moscow with the ambitious goal of uniting the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, he was assigned missionary duties in Zagreb, where he was a teacher at the Zagreb Theological Seminary as well as a priest in several neighboring towns.
Life in Russia.
Križanić managed to secure permission from the papacy for a brief visit to Moscow from October 25 through December 19, 1647. However, he was not able to secure permission for a prolonged stay until 1658 (it was retracted shortly after being issued, a fact that Križanić simply ignored) and he did not arrive in Moscow until September 17, 1659. He was assigned the duty of translating Latin and Greek documents and preparing an improved Slavic grammar. However, he was exiled to Siberia on January 20, 1661. The reason for his exile is still unknown. Possible explanations put forward have included the fact that he was a Roman Catholic priest, his criticism of Russian society and of the Greeks, with whom Patriarch Nikon was attempting reconciliation, and other political and social motives. Križanić postulated that he was exiled because of "some foolish thing" he had said to someone, and that whatever he had said had been mentioned to the authorities.
After his stay of roughly a year and a half in the Russian capital, Križanić arrived in Tobolsk in Siberia, on March 8, 1661. He lived there for 15 years, surviving on a state stipend and working on the treatises "On Divine Providence", "On Politics", and "On Interpretation of Historic Prognostications" amongst others. In these books, written in his self-devised "Common Slavonic language" (a Pan-Slavonic grammar named "Grammatitchno Iskaziniye" that incorporated numerous Slavic languages), he set forth a comprehensive program of reforms required for the Russian state, including reforms to administration, Russian serfdom, economic policy, education, grammar, and Russia's primitive agricultural system. Many of the reforms he recommended were in fact carried out by Peter the Great, although there is no concrete evidence of Križanić's direct influence in his doing so. His "Politika," which he wrote from 1663-1666, was published by Peter Bezsonov ("Russia in the Seventeenth Century", 1859–60) and for the first time in English in 1985 and is his most well known and influential work.
His appeal to the Czar to head the Slavs in the fight against the Germans shows a remarkable political foresight. Križanić was freed from exile on March 5, 1676. After that he remained in Moscow until 1678, when he travelled to Vilnius and later to Warsaw. He accompanied a Polish force on its way to liberate besieged Vienna from the Ottomans during the Battle of Vienna, where he died in 1683.
Ideas and theories.
Križanić was one of the earliest proponents of Pan-Slavism. The language he created and used in his writing (his "Common Slavonic Language") was a mixture of several Slavic languages and was devised to serve as a symbol of and even to promote Slavic unity.
A key component of Križanić's theories concerning necessary reforms for the Russian state were his "Five Principles of Power." His five principles were: Full autocracy (essentially absolute monarchy), closed borders, compulsory labor or a ban on idleness, government monopoly of foreign trade, and ideological conformity. Križanić argued that Russia would be strengthened if immigration were tightly restricted and if native Russians were prohibited from leaving the country without justification.
His works, which also include writings on music and economics, were re-discovered and printed in the mid-19th century.

Wesley Fry

Wesley Leonard "Cowboy" Fry (December 10, 1902 – November 11, 1970) was an American football player, coach of football and baseball, and professional football executive. He served as the head football coach at Kansas State University from 1935 to 1939, tallying a mark of 18–21–6. Fry was also the head baseball coach at Kansas State from 1935 to 1938 and at Northwestern University from 1944 to 1946, compiling a career college baseball record of 53–53–2. He later served as director of player personnel and then as general manager with the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League from 1960 to 1963.
Playing career.
Fry played college football at the University of Iowa under legendary coach Howard Jones, excelling as a fullback. He was named to play in the first East-West Shrine Game following his senior season in 1925. Fry then spent the 1926 and 1927 seasons playing professional football with Red Grange for the New York Yankees. At the same time, Fry attended law school.
Coaching career.
After earning his law degree, Fry quit playing professional football and sought to practice law in Oklahoma, but he was quickly diverted onto the path of a football coach. He began his career coaching football at high schools and small colleges in Oklahoma. In 1934, when future Hall of Fame coach Pappy Waldorf moved north from Oklahoma State to Kansas State, he hired Fry to be his lone assistant coach at K-State. Then, when Waldorf left Kansas State after one season, Fry was hired as the new head coach at Kansas State in 1935.
Fry held the head coaching position at Kansas State for five seasons, posting an 18–21–6 record. Fry also coached the baseball team at Kansas State during this time. Fry stepped aside following the 1939 season when his own assistant coach began politicking for the job of head football coach, but not before coaching the second-ever televised college football game.
For the 1940 season, Fry rejoined Waldorf as an assistant coach at Northwestern University. In 1947, Fry moved with Waldorf to the University of California. Fry remained Waldorf's assistant coach at Cal through the end of Waldorf's term, in 1956, despite receiving offers of head coaching positions from Oregon State University and Arizona State University.
Administrative career and later life.
In 1960, Fry joined the Oakland Raiders organization, which was commencing operations as a member of the American Football League. He first served as director of player personnel, then as general manager of the franchise until 1963, when Al Davis was hired as general manager and head coach. Fry died on November 11, 1970 at his home in La Mesa, California.

Algiers putsch of 1961

The Algiers putsch ( or ), also known as the Generals' putsch ("Putsch des Généraux"), was a failed coup d'état to overthrow French President Charles de Gaulle (aged 70) and establish an anti-communist military junta. Organised in French Algeria by retired French army generals Maurice Challe (55, former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), Edmond Jouhaud (56, former Inspector General of the French Air Force), André Zeller (63, former Chief of staff of the French Ground Army) and Raoul Salan (61, former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), it took place from the afternoon of 21 April to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954–1962).
The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debré's government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). General Raoul Salan argued that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been considered a four-man coup d'état, or as de Gaulle famously put it, "un quarteron de généraux en retraite" (a quartet of retired generals).
The coup was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French Algeria's major cities Algiers, Oran and Constantine, followed by the seizure of Paris. The metropolitan operation would be led by Colonel Antoine Argoud, with French paratroopers descending on strategic airfields. The commanders in Oran and Constantine, however, refused to follow Challe's demand that they join the coup. At the same time, information about the metropolitan phase came to Prime Minister Debré's attention through the intelligence service.
On 22 April, all flights and landings were forbidden in Parisian airfields, and an order was given to the army to resist the coup "by all means". The following day, President Charles de Gaulle made a famous speech on television, dressed with his 1940s-vintage general's uniform (he was 70 years old and long retired from the army) ordering the French people and army to help him.
Context.
The majority of the French people had voted in favor of Algerian self-determination during the disputed referendum of 8 January 1961 organised in metropolitan France. The wording of the referendum was "Do you approve the Bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic concerning the self-determination of the Algerian population and the organisation of the public power in Algeria prior to self-determination".
French citizens living abroad or serving abroad in the military were allowed to vote, as were all adult Algerians, both Muslim and European, in a single electoral college. Speaking for the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (the political arm of the FLN), Ferhat Abbas called for a boycott of the referendum, as did sixteen retired French generals and factions amongst the "pied noir" (French settler) community opposed to independence. In total four out of ten individuals in France and Algeria entitled to vote abstained.
Following the outcome of the referendum, Michel Debré's government started secret negotiations with the GPRA. On 25 January 1961, Colonel Antoine Argoud visited with Premier Debré and threatened him with a coup directed by a "colonels' junta"; the French Army was in no way disposed to let the French Algerian départements created in 1848 after the 1830 conquest become independent.
Chronology.
On 22 April 1961, retired generals Maurice Challe, André Zeller and Raoul Salan, helped by colonels Antoine Argoud, Jean Gardes, and the civilians Joseph Ortiz and Jean-Jacques Susini (who would form the OAS terrorist group), took control of Algiers. General Challe criticised what he saw as the government's treason and lies toward French Algeria colonists and loyalist Muslims who trusted it, and stated that
During the night, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1e REP), composed of a thousand men, and headed by Hélie de Saint Marc took control of all of Algiers' strategic points in three hours. The units directly involved in the putsch were the 1st and 2nd REP and the 14th and 18th Regiments of "Chasseurs Parachutistes". Together they comprised the elite units of the airborne divisions of the French Army. Initially there were pledges of support from other regiments (the 27th Dragoons, the 94th Infantry, the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs and several Marine Infantry units) but these seem to have reflected the views of senior officers only and there was no active participation.
The head of the Parisian police, Maurice Papon, and the director of the "Sûreté nationale", formed a crisis cell in a room of the Comédie-Française, where Charles de Gaulle was attending a presentation of Racine's "Britannicus". The president was informed during the "entracte" of the coup by Jacques Foccart, his general secretary of African and Malagasy Affairs and closest collaborator, in charge of covert operations.
Algiers' population was awakened on 22 April at 7 am to a message read on the radio: "The army has seized control of Algeria and of the Sahara". The three rebel generals, Challe, Jouhaud and Zeller, had the government's general delegate, Jean Morin, arrested, as well as the National Minister of Public Transport, Robert Buron, who was visiting, and several civil and military authorities. Several regiments put themselves under the command of the insurrectionary generals.
General Jacques Faure, six other officers and several civilians were simultaneously arrested in Paris. At 5 pm, during the ministers' council, Charles de Gaulle declared: "Gentlemen, what is serious about this affair, is that it isn't serious". He then proclaimed a state of emergency in Algeria, while left wing parties, communist trade union CGT and the socialist supporter NGO "Ligue des droits de l'homme" (LDH, Human Rights League) called to demonstrate against the military's coup d'état.
The following day, on Sunday 23 April, General Salan arrived from Spain and refused to arm civilian activists. At 8 pm, President de Gaulle appeared in his military uniform on television, calling on French military personnel and civilians, in metropolitan France or in Algeria, to oppose the putsch:
Due to the popularity of a recent invention, transistor radio, de Gaulle's call was heard by the conscript soldiers, who refused "en masse" to follow the professional soldiers' call for insurgency. The putsch met with widespread opposition, largely in the form of civil resistance, including a one-hour general strike called by the trade unions the day after de Gaulle's broadcast.
On Tuesday April 25 the French authorities in Paris ordered the explosion of the atomic bomb "Gerboise Verte" (lit. "green jerboa") in the Sahara as part of a scheduled testing program. Gerboise Verte exploded at 6:05 AM. While the test and test site were already prepped as part of the French national nuclear program, the test appears to have accelerated to ensure the security of the device was not compromised.
The few military units which had followed the generals progressively surrendered. General Challe also gave himself up to the authorities on 26 April, and was immediately transferred to the metropolitan France. The putsch had been successfully opposed, but the article 16 on full and extraordinary powers given to de Gaulle was maintained for five months. "The Battle of the Transistors"—as it was called by the press—was quickly and definitely won by de Gaulle.
Casualties.
The only known fatality was French Army Sergeant Pierre Brillant, who was killed by the putschists while defending the radio transmitter at Ouled Fayet, Algiers. Brillant was aiming at 1st REP 3rd Company Captain Estoup when he was shot by a legionnaire.
Trials and amnesty.
A military court condemned Challe and André Zeller to fifteen years of prison. However, they were granted an amnesty and had their military positions restored five years later. Raoul Salan and Jouhaud escaped. Salan was condemned "in absentia" to the death penalty (later commuted to life sentence) as was Jouhaud. Salan and others later founded the OAS, a dissident paramilitary organization which attempted to stop the on-going process of the April 1962 Independence Evian Agreements for the Algerian territories of France. A July 1968 act granted amnesty; the November 24, 1982 law reintegrated the surviving generals into the army. Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, and six other generals benefitted from this law.
Controversy around CIA and BND allegations.
There had been allegations in France, reported first in communist papers and then even in "Le Monde", that individuals within the CIA supported the coup. However, it was later discovered that this accusation was based off forged documents planted by the KGB in various newspapers. British historian Alistair Horne concurs that the allegation of CIA support for the putsch was "a canard launched by the Communist Press." Only two days before the Algiers putsch, the CIA had staged a failed coup in Cuba against its leader Fidel Castro, known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Regardless, the CIA did not support Challe's coup attempt and U.S. President John F. Kennedy contacted de Gaulle assuring him of his support, including military assistance if needed. President de Gaulle rejected Kennedy's support.
French journalist Patrick Pesnot has also claimed that the French generals also had the support of the "Bundesnachrichtendienst" (West German Federal Intelligence Service) leader Reinhard Gehlen.
General Challe always claimed he had never been in contact with foreign countries in this affair.

Barry Burns

Barry Burns is a Scottish musician best known for his work with post-rock band Mogwai.
Early life.
Burns went to Cardinal Newman High School in Bellshill before enrolling with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, taking up a Bachelor of Education degree in teaching music. He did not finish the degree, completing only 3 years of the course. He broke his finger, which is why he did not go back, though he has also said that he was not at ease with the teaching part of the course.
Career.
Mogwai.
Burns joined Mogwai just before the recording of their second album, "Come on Die Young". He had already played a few gigs with the band beforehand as a flautist and occasional pianist. According to Stuart Braithwaite, Burns joined the band because he was a "good laugh". Burns is a versatile multi-instrumentalist and contributes (among other things) keyboards, guitar, vocals (mainly through a Vocoder), and flute. He is also the only member of Mogwai with a formal foundation in music theory, but he claims he is "a bit rusty".
Other.
Burns contributed piano, and organ to the Arab Strap's albums, "Elephant Shoe", "The Red Thread", "Monday at the Hug and Pint", and "The Last Romance". He contributed piano, organ, rhodes, and vocals to Malcolm Middleton's albums, "", "Into The Woods", "A Brighter Beat" and "Sleight of Heart". He has also played keyboards on the 2009 album "Prevention" by Scottish band De Rosa. He often plays DJ sets, often alongside fellow band member Stuart Braithwaite.

Pure Food and Drug Act (band)

Pure Food and Drug Act 
(listed in The All Music Guide to the Blues, the Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music ) was a band that was formed in the early 1970s by Don "Sugarcane" Harris. The band began with Paul Lagos on drums, Larry Taylor on bass and Randy Resnick on guitar. Resnick was at that time experimenting with a one and two handed tapping technique which later became a standard guitarist's tool. The group played small rooms in the Los Angeles area, such as the Troubadour and the Ash Grove, for several months.
While the band was searching for a record deal, Larry Taylor allegedly began to tire of Don's constant lateness and irresponsibility and decided to continue his career with John Mayall. At the same time, Harvey Mandel, a Mayall alumnus, was brought in to beef up the accompaniment and to stimulate record label interest, as he already had a following from his Chicago blues days. To replace Taylor on bass, a relative newcomer, Victor Conte, was recruited from Common Ground, a funk band in Fresno that Resnick had played in. Conte went on to play in Tower of Power and with Herbie Hancock in his Monster Band.
"Choice Cuts" was the band's only album, recorded live in Seattle in 1972, but it was mostly unsuccessful. Allegedly because of Don's unreliable nature, the band rarely rehearsed. Live performances included extended solos and improvised ensemble sections, and one song would often last 20 minutes or more. Various line-up changes took place until the band broke up a few years after releasing its first album.

Mighty Mighty

Mighty Mighty were an indie band formed in Birmingham, England in the mid-1980s. Showing influences from Postcard Records bands such as Orange Juice, they came to prominence when featured on the NME's "C86" compilation, at around the same time that they released their debut single "Everybody Knows The Monkey". This was soon followed by a 12" single - "Is There Anyone Out There?" before the band signed to Chapter 22 Records, releasing a string of well-received singles and the album "Sharks" in 1988. With their brand of indie pop giving way to American influenced rock and shoegazing, they split in 1988.
Singer Hugh once said during an interview that the difference between Mighty Mighty and The Smiths was that "they write two-minute pop songs and we write three-minute pop songs".
Continuing interest in the band saw the reissue of "Sharks" in 2000, the release of a compilation album of BBC session tracks in 2001, and two compilations of singles and unreleased tracks in 2000 and 2001. 
They reformed for the Indietracks music festival in 2009.
They played Popfest Berlin in 2010, followed by Firestation Records of Berlin issuing their 'lost second album' on vinyl and CD, 25 years after it was recorded.
In 2013 Cherry Red Records released a major double CD compilation entitled 'Pop Can - the definitive collection 1986-88'.

Dick Guindon

Richard "Dick" Gordon Guindon (born December 2, 1935, St. Paul, Minnesota) is an American cartoonist best known for his gag panel, "Guindon". Guindon's cartoons have appeared in the "Minneapolis Tribune", "The Realist" and the "Detroit Free Press". During the late 1950s, Guindon attended the University of Minnesota where he drew cartoons for "The Minnesota Daily", as recalled by Stan Gotlieb:
Biography.
Living in New York during the early 1960s, Guindon began contributing to "The Nation", "Playboy", "Esquire" and "Down Beat". He also drew cartoons for Paul Krassner's "The Realist" and was associated with Krassner's class at the Free School. Guindon's best known work from the 1960s was published in "The Realist", which included adult-themed references to politics and current events of the time.
Leaving New York, Guindon returned to Minnesota where "Mpls.St.Paul Magazine" said in its "Encyclopedia Minnesotica" that Guindon is "Minnesota's greatest satirist"." 
In 1981, Guindon moved from Minnesota to work in Michigan for the "Detroit Free Press", which issued a 1984 datebook, "Guindon's Detroit". In May 1984, he made an appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson". He had a three-month art exhibition, "Richard Guindon, 1981-1984" at the Flint Institute of Arts from March 10 to May 26, 1985. That same year, he took an extended vacation, continuing to draw his cartoons while driving around Europe.
Guindon began his self-titled cartoon series for the Minneapolis Tribune in 1974. At first it appeared three to four times per week, then became a daily in 1978 when it was picked up by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. In 1981, the syndication was moved to Field Enterprises, and then in 1984 to News America Syndicate. The syndication of the panel appears to have ended in 1985, but the cartoon may have survived as a feature of the "Detroit Free Press" until later, perhaps 1987. 
When he returned to the United States, he moved to Traverse City, Michigan in March 1986, and the following August he set up his studio in the Masonic Hall building in downtown Traverse City with a third-floor view of Grand Traverse Bay. Eight months later, the historic four-story building was destroyed by fire. "I've lost 30-some years of work," said Guindon. "It's funny this building should wait 97 years for me to move into it before burning. It really hasn't hit me yet. I think tomorrow is going to be a very grim day" More than 5,000 cartoons and sketches burned in the April 1987 fire, but a few weeks later Guindon learned that Irv Letofsky, Sunday editor of the "Los Angeles Times" "Calendar" section, had saved a copy of every Guindon cartoon syndicated over a decade. 
In 1988, Guindon broke out of the single-panel mold and began a multi-panel comic strip, "The Carp Chronicles", commenting, "Nothing ever works out in Carp City. I don't know why. They're very nice people. It's not a pretty story, but it has to be told."
Guindon now lives in Northern Michigan in the village of Suttons Bay. Guindon announced his retirement in 2005.
Bibliography.
Guindon's cartoons have been collected in several books:

William Sturgis Bigelow

William Sturgis Bigelow (1850–1926) was an American physician and collector of Japanese art. He was one of the first Americans to live in Japan , and to introduce the American public to Japanese art and culture. He was also among those who adhered to the philosophy of the "White man's burden", and worked to establish protections for Japanese art during a time when some Japanese were willing to sell or destroy elements of their own traditional culture in a fervor of Westernization and modernization.
Early career.
A brilliant medical student, Bigelow received his degree in medicine from Harvard University in 1874, and continued his medical studies in Europe for five years, under Louis Pasteur. Though his primary interest was, accordingly, bacteriology, his father was a surgeon, and so he was pressured to perform surgery as well.
Bigelow and Japan.
Instead, in 1882, Bigelow traveled to Japan with Ernest Fenollosa and Edward Sylvester Morse. This may have been intended originally as simply a vacation from the world of medicine, but in the end, Bigelow remained in Japan for seven years. There, he became an art collector, and traveled the country for some time, exploring it and studying its culture, art, and religion. Bigelow would eventually convert to Buddhism. He also contributed financially to the establishment of the "Nihon Bijutsuin" (Japan Fine Arts Academy), which was founded by his friend and ofttimes traveling companion Okakura Kakuzō.
As a result of the determination of Fenollosa and Morse, as well as their special authorizations under the Japanese government, Bigelow was able to explore parts of Japan closed to outside viewers for centuries. The group visited the Shōsō-in (Treasure House) of Tōdai-ji, viewing hidden treasures of Emperor Shōmu, and were granted a few shards of pottery, the only items belonging to the Shōsō-in known to currently reside outside of it. Among the many other items he obtained during his time in Japan were a set of gilt bronze statues from Hōryū-ji, of the historical Buddha and attendants, known as the Shaka Trinity statues, and a mandala from the Hokke-do (Lotus Sutra Hall) of Tōdai-ji, one of the oldest Japanese paintings to ever leave Japan.
A photographer, Bigelow recorded many of the sights he and his companions came across. As Fenollosa and Okakura were granted authority by the Japanese government to open temple rooms and storehouses unopened for centuries, in order to record and therefore preserve their contents, Bigelow's photographs of these events are of great historical importance as well.
Returning to the United States, Bigelow donated over 40,000 objects of Japanese art to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. His efforts, along with those of Morse, Fenollosa, Charles Goddard Weld, Okakura, and a handful of others, made the newly founded Department of the Art of Asia at the Museum of Fine Arts the largest collection of Japanese art anywhere outside of Japan; this is a distinction it still holds today. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911.
He was considered "at once an epicure and a mystic, who professed an ascetic religion and wore beautiful Charvet haberdashery."
Upon Bigelow's death, in accordance with his final requests, Bigelow's remains were cremated; half the ashes were buried at Mii-dera, just outside Kyoto, along with those of Fenollosa, and half were interred in the Sturgis family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery.
Bigelow was the man who introduced Baron Kaneko Kentarō to Theodore Roosevelt by a letter of introduction. They first met in 1890 when Roosevelt was Head of the Civil Service Commission and Kaneko was returning to Japan from Europe via the U.S.

Ballet Department.
The Ballet Department offers courses in classical, character, duet and historical dance, artistry, ballet and theatre history, as well as other art subjects. Training of a ballet artist is divided into three stages – early artistic training (grades 1–4), specialized artist training with the first professional skills (grades 5–8) and a two-level professional training comprising grades 9–10 and grades 11–13. It is cited as one of the finest in the Baltic.
Between 1986 and 2001 the department was an independent Vilnius Ballet School. Eglė Špokaitė graduated here in 1989 and Jolanta Valeikaitė is also amongst its notable past alumni.
Notable students.

Sileo would also that summer become a honorary member of the Hells Angels and ride with the Bridgeport, Ct chapter. He then went to the University of Miami Hurricanes to form College Football's Greatest defensive Line in Jerome Brown,Daniel Stubbs,Bill Hawkins and Sileo. In 1986, Sileo led the Hurricanes defensive line in solo tackles with 50 and 97 total and tackles for loss with 13 and third in sacks with 6 and first in fumbles with 8. In Sileo's games in 1986 vs. Florida and Florida State, Sileo would register 24 tackles 3 sacks and 5 tackles for loss. He was also the leading tackler in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl, where Sileo started the game off with a QB sack of Penn State QB John Shaffer; Miami fell 14-10 to Penn State with over 70 million viewers watching the Fiesta Bowl with a 24.9 share and 25.1% of households tuned in. He made All South and was an All-America honorable mention and 2nd team All American by Sport magazine in 1986. He was named to the Sporting News preseason All American team in 1987. Sileo in 1987 was a "Sporting News" preseason Outland Trophy & Lombardi Trophy candidate. Sileo is the strongest Miami Hurricane Football player of all time with a 535 pound Bench Press & 700 pound Squat. Sileo was named to "Sports Illustrated"'s All-Time College Football Walk-On Team in 1992. In 2010 "Sports Illustrated" Voted Sileo's 1986 Miami Hurricane Football team the most hated team in American sports history.
Sileo ran out of his five-year eligibility for NCAA play after the 1986 season. On September 6, 1987, two days after the NCAA deemed him ineligible, Sileo claimed that because he had not entered the 1986 NFL Draft, he was a free agent; he proceeded to sign with the Buccaneers. The NFL declared the contract invalid and put him in the 1987 NFL Supplemental Draft. Although Sileo initially sued the NFL and the Bucs to honor his original contract, he eventually submitted to the Supplemental Draft, where the Bucs selected him in the third round (59th overall). Sileo is the second-highest drafted defensive lineman in Supplemental Draft history. Sileo spent his entire NFL career as a backup and special teams player. The only regular season games he played in were during the 1987 season. Sileo was named to the NFL's Honorable Mention All-Rookie Team.
He eventually played for the Orlando Thunder of the World League of American Football in 1992, where he was a first team All-League, and helped lead the team to the World Bowl in Montreal, Canada, where they lost to the Sacramento Surge 21-17. His last professional team was the Las Vegas Sting of the Arena Football League in 1994, where he made honorable mention All League and helped lead the Sting to the AFL playoffs, where they lost to the Arizona Rattlers 51-46 to wrap up his pro football career.
Radio career.
Sileo was hired by San Francisco KGO Radio 810 where he was a sports anchor on the morning show called "Dunbar and Rosie" and was hired by former GM Mickey Luckoff. Sileo moved across the street to KNBR 680 were Sileo hosted "Sportsphone 68" and The Ticket 1050 where he hosted the morning show with Rod Brooks called "Ebony and Ivory" from 6-10am . He was also on the Oakland Raiders pre- and postgame shows and was the sideline reporter for Stanford Cardinal football and the San Jose Sabercats pre- and postgame host. In 1998 Sileo moved to Tampa, Florida to take over the morning show on 620 WDAE where he took the morning show over and raised the ratings for the show into the top 5. In 2000, he moved to Fox Sports Radio in Los Angeles, California, where he hosted a 4am-8am program called "The Dan Sileo Show". Sileo was the first person hired by than CEO Kraig Kitchin in the network's history; he got the show to 233 stations. In September 2002, Sileo moved back to Florida and debuted on 740 The Team in Orlando. His program, "The Dan Sileo Show", began airing from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern, with an emphasis on hot topic issues such as race, drugs, and other sports scandals, as well as a typical morning wrap-up of the previous day's events. For a short time in 2004, the program was syndicated on WINZ 940 AM in Miami. On weekends, Sileo also has worked as an analyst on Westwood One radio.
In December 2007, 740 the Team began a format change. Sileo announced on-air that he had signed a new contract extension with Clear Channel to continue his show, but it would move down the dial to NewsRadio 540 WFLA. In January 2008, WQTM switched to a Spanish-language format, and "The Dan Sileo Show" settled into its new permanent home at NewsRadio 540 WFLA.
In March 2008, Sileo's radio show was cancelled by "930 The Fox" in Jacksonville, Florida. It was returned to the station in January 2009.
His last stop at 620AM WDAE in Tampa, Florida was as morning drive host from 1998 to 2012. Jacor former executives Gabe Hobbs and CEO Randy Michaels were major influences in Sileo's success and Michaels has called Sileo the best sportstalk radio host in America and Hobbs now represents Sileo along with Stuart Levin (www.GabeHobbsMedia.com). Sileo was syndicated in Orlando, back on 740 The Game (after that station changed back to a sports format). Sileo is also a Heisman Trophy voter, a member of the Football Writers Association of America and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) media. In 2011 TV sports columnist Jim Wlliams of the "Washington Examiner" wrote that Sileo is the best morning sports radio host in the country. In July 2012, Sileo was named to "Talkers Magazine" TOP 100 SportsTalk Hosts in America at #32.
His career has been marked by a series of several controversial events that led to his firing from three radio stations in 2012 and 2013.
Sileo was fired from WDAE-620 AM in March 2012 after he called three black NFL free agents "monkeys." The Tampa Bay Times reported that, while discussing the possibility of Cortland Finnegan, Vincent Jackson and Jonathan Vilma joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sileo said, "If they get those three monkeys, I'm good. I'm ready, man. I'm ready. I want those guys. Those guys are great players."
Sileo joined Miami's WQAM-560 AM in April 2012 but was fired in March 2013 after several public missteps. In January 2013, he was suspended from the station after a series of sexist tweets directed at Fox Sports broadcaster Erin Andrews. The Tampa Tribune reported that one of the comments referred to a 2008 incident in which a stalker secretly recorded a video of Andrews in her hotel room. Sileo tweeted to Andrews: "pepe hole best thing for ur career." He also referred to her as a "bimbo," told her to "make me dinner" and bake me a cake" and added, "love Erin either naked or in a porn..not at a sports desk." The Miami Herald reported that an on-air anti-Semitic remark on Jan. 30 was the decisive factor. The newspaper reported that Sileo's comment — "that's the half Hebrew in me" — regarding saving money prompted a letter of protest from the Anti-Defamation League. Sileo posted on his Twitter account that his grandmother was Jewish, “and because my grandmom is Jewish..my nfl friends lose all [their money..i said.. ‘I save nickel I have and that’s the hebrew.”
Sileo joined Palm Beach's WMEN-640 AM in August 2013 but was fired on Nov. 4, 2013, after tweeting the previous day that he would pay $1,000 to any University of Miami football player that “TAKES THIS KID OUT” while attaching a photo of a Florida State University football player. FSU defeated Miami two days earlier. Sileo deleted the tweet, claiming he was only joking, but WMEN fired him. “As a result of Dan Sileo’s action on his personal Twitter account ... WMEN has terminated his independent contractor relationship with the station,” WMEN said on its website. “The ownership, staff, and management of WMEN 640 Sports do not condone his actions which have no place in sports.”
Sileo has been hired by San Diego's THE MIGHTY 1090 AM in February 2014 to do AM morning drive from 6-9am Monday thru Friday, the show is also heard in Los Angeles.

Performing arts education

Education in the performing arts is a key part of many primary and secondary education curricula and is also available as a specialisation at the tertiary level. The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels. This engagement through participation and formal and informal education is often lifelong.
The end point for performing arts education varies, for some people it is part of their engagement in their own and others culture, such as that of indigenous peoples and folklore, for others it leads to professional careers up to an elite level.
For this latter group, depending on the discipline, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential. This is seen particularly with classical ballet and circus arts. 
Performing arts are often a core curriculum area in education and seeks to expose students to ways to "express ideas and emotions that they cannot express in language alone". The curriculum needs to be sequential, from preschool to high school, to develop "students’ skills and understanding of creating, performing, and responding", to "promotes knowledge and understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of the arts" and provide opportunities for students to make connections among the arts, with other disciplines within the core curriculum, and with arts resources in the community.
The performing arts.
The performing arts differ from the plastic arts insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their appearance by special clothing, stage makeup, etc. 
The breadth of areas covered by the performing arts is wide, including:

Guinness World Records Primetime (aka: "Guinness Primetime") was a TV show based on the Guinness Book of World Records, and aired on the Fox television network from July 27, 1998 to October 4, 2001. It was hosted by Cris Collinsworth and Mark Thompson and reported on existing record-holders or on new record attempts. 
These new record attempts included many unusual or bizarre categories such as a 300-pound tumor, squirting milk from one's eye, covering one's self with bees, sitting in a tub of snakes, regurgitating, burping, setting one's self on fire, eating metal, worms, and ketchup, kissing cobras, acting as a human speed bump, and entering a coffin full of cockroaches. Most of these attempts never found their way into the Guinness Book. The show was met with poor ratings and even poorer reviews: viewers and critics alike were confused and appalled by the disturbing "records" being attempted.

Art Pollard

Art Pollard (May 5, 1927 – May 12, 1973), was an American racecar driver.
Born in Dragon, Utah, Pollard died in Indianapolis, Indiana, as a result of injuries sustained in practice for the 1973 Indianapolis 500. The car clipped the wall coming out of turn one and did a half-spin as it headed to the grass on the inside of the short chute. The chassis dug into the grass and flipped upside-down, slid a short distance and then flipped back over as it reached the pavement again in turn two, finally coming to a stop in the middle of the track. The total distance covered was . The car was demolished. The impact tore off two wheels immediately, and the wings were also torn off during the slide. Pollard's lap prior to the crash was timed at a speed of 192+ mph. Pollard was rushed to Methodist Hospital in the new Cardiac ambulance. His injuries were reported to include pulmonary damage due to flame inhalation, burns on both hands, face and neck, and a broken arm.
He drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1965–1973 seasons, with 84 career starts, including the 1967–1971 Indianapolis 500 races. He finished in the top ten 30 times, with 2 victories, both in 1969, at Milwaukee and Dover. He had just turned 46 one week before he died.

Tadashige Daigo

Marquis was a vice admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.
Biography.
Born in Chiyoda, Tokyo into a "kuge" family of court nobility related to the Fujiwara aristocracy, Daigo was a graduate of the "Gakushuin" Peers' school. He went on to graduate from the 40th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1912. His rank on entering was only 126th out of 150 cadets, but he improved his scores, so that he graduated at 17th out of 144.
Daigo served as a midshipman on the cruiser and battleship . As an ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser .
After his promotion to sub-lieutenant in 1913, he took time out to attend a session of the House of Peers as was obligatory for members of his social class. He then returned to active service on the battleship and destroyer .
Daigo was promoted to lieutenant in 1918, and after taking courses in torpedo warfare, was assigned to submarines, serving on , and then becoming captain of , followed by . He also served on the cruiser in 1924. After promotion to lieutenant commander in 1924, he was captain of in 1926, and chief torpedo officer on the battleship later the same year.
In the 1930s, Daigo was captain of a large number of cruisers in rapid succession: , , , , , and . He was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1940.
Daigo commanded Submarine Squadron 5 (Subron 5), with hisa flag on the light cruiser at the start of the Pacific War. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Subron 5 was covering the first wave of the Malaya Invasion Force south of the Cape of Camau, French Indochina.
On 9 December 1941, Subron 5 was ordered to pursue and sink the Royal Navy Force Z (battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). Although "Yura" received word from that the British ships were spotted, due to poor wireless reception, the signal was unclear and the British vessels were overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from bases in Indochina before "Yura" and her submarines could take action.
Subron 5 was then assigned to the invasion of Sarawak from 13–26 December, covering landings in Brunei, Miri, Seria, and Kuching. The 2,500 men of the "Kawaguchi Detachment" and the No. 2 Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) quickly captured Miri's airfield and oil fields. The operation was completed, and "Yura" returned to its base at Camranh Bay, Indochina by the end of the year.
Subron 5 was also part of the advance screening force for the Battle of Midway.
Daigo became vice admiral on 1 November 1943. He was assigned command of the Eastern Attack Group which carried out midget submarine and merchant shipping attacks on the east coast of Australia.
Daigo was Commandant of the Naval Submarine School from 23 August 1944 and final Commander in Chief of the IJN 6th Fleet from 1 May 1945. During these assignments, he was involved in the "kaiten" human-torpedo program.
After the end of the war, Daigo was arrested by SCAP authorities at the request of the Netherlands government, and was extradited to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, where he was charged with war crimes in connection with the kidnapping, torture and massacre of 21,000 people (including women and children) by Japanese troops in Pontianak during the Pontianak incidents. After being held for several months under severe conditions, he was found guilty in a closed military tribunal at Pontianak after only three hours of testimony, during which time he was not allowed to speak in his own defense, and was executed with a rifle shot to the stomach on 6 December 1947. As Daigo was commander of submarine forces, (although from 8 November 1943 the 22nd Special Guard Division based at Balikpapan, Borneo fell nominally under his command), his connection (if any) with the events in Pontianak from 23 April 1943 – 28 June 1944 remain very unclear. Whereas other "Class B" war criminals found guilty of professional negligence for atrocities committed by junior staff under their nominal command were sentenced to several years in prison, the speed and secrecy surrounding his trial, and the severity and brutality of his punishment, have created questions which remain unanswered.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor

The fibroblast growth factor receptors are, as their name implies, receptors that bind to members of the fibroblast growth factor family of proteins. Some of these receptors are involved in pathological conditions. For example, a point mutation in FGFR3 can lead to achondroplasia.
Structure.
The fibroblast growth factor receptors consist of a cellular ligand domain composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane helix domain, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. 
These receptors bind fibroblast growth factors, members of the largest family of growth factor ligands, comprising 22 members.
The natural alternate splicing of four fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes results in the production of over 48 different isoforms of FGFR.
These isoforms vary in their ligand-binding properties and kinase domains, however all share the common extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin(Ig)-like domains (D1-D3), and thus belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily.
The three immunoglobin(Ig)-like domains - D1, D2, and D3 - present a stretch of acidic amino acids ("the acid box") between D1 and D2. This "acid box" can participate in the regulation of FGF binding to the FGFR. Immunoglobulin-like domains D2 and D3 are sufficient for FGF binding. Each receptor can be activated by several FGFs. In many cases, the FGFs themselves can also activate more than one receptor (i.e., FGF1, which binds all seven principal FGFRs). FGF7, however, can only activate FGFR2b, and FGF18 was recently shown to activate FGFR3.
A gene for a fifth FGFR protein, FGFR5, has also been identified. In contrast to FGFRs 1-4, it lacks a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and one isoform, FGFR5γ, and only contains the extracellular domains D1 and D2.
The FGFRs are known to dimerize as heterodimers and homodimers.
Genes.
So far, five distinct membrane FGFR have been identified in vertebrates and all of them belong to the tyrosine kinase superfamily (FGFR1 to FGFR4).

Aki Ra

Aki Ra (sometimes written Akira) is a former Khmer Rouge conscripted child soldier who works as a deminer and museum curator in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He has devoted his life to removing landmines in Cambodia and to caring for young landmine victims. Aki Ra states that since 1992 he has personally removed and destroyed as many as 50,000 landmines.
Early life.
Aki Ra is unsure of his age, but believes he was born in 1970 or 1973. His parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge. Orphaned in a Khmer Rouge camp, he was taken in by a woman named Yourn who raised him and several other orphaned children. Like many others, he soon became a child soldier once his strength became sufficient to make him useful to local Khmer Rouge military commanders. When the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia with the intention of toppling the Khmer Rouge political regime, he was taken into the custody of Vietnamese soldiers. Later he enlisted with the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces formed by the new government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea. His duties included placing landmines along the mined area on Cambodia's border with Thailand.
The name "Aki Ra" was given to him by a Japanese acquaintance and is not his birth name. According to Aki Ra:
Landmine clearing.
Having laid thousands of landmines as a soldier, Aki Ra found employment as a deminer with the UN in 1991. After leaving UNMAS in 1992, he continued disarming and removing mines in his community. Having no demining tools, he used a knife, a hoe, a Leatherman and a stick. He would defuse the landmines and UXOs he found in small villages and bring home the empty casings. Sometimes he would sell them as scrap to help fund his work.
Tourists began hearing stories about a young Khmer man who cleared landmines with a stick and had a house full of defused ordnance. in 1999 Aki Ra began charging a dollar to see his collection, using the money to help further his activities. Thus began the Cambodian Landmine Museum.
Aki Ra cleared landmines where he had fought, when he heard about an accident, or when village chiefs and farmers would call him at the museum and tell him of mines in their villages and ask for his help. He conducted informal mine risk education groups to teach people about the dangers of unexploded ordnance and landmines.
Adopted children.
While working in these villages he found many injured and abandoned children. He brought them home to live with him and his wife Hourt. Some of the children who moved to their home were also street kids from Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Eventually he brought home over two dozen boys and girls. 
In early 2009, a boy came to live with Aki Ra and Hourt who had lost an arm and most of a hand to a cluster munition. He was working with his uncle in a field near Battambang, west of Siem Reap when he found an explosive probably left over from the Cambodian Civil War. Aki Ra found him in the hospital and told his family about the Museum. He now lives there and attends school. Today, 29 children live at the Cambodia Landmine Museum Relief Center. In the past they were mainly landmine victims, but now they also include children born without limbs, polio victims, and some with HIV; some are orphans and some have parents who cannot afford to raise them. Funds from the museum are entirely dedicated to the support of these children to feed them, clothe them, and send them to school.
Cambodian Self Help Demining.
Cambodian government authorities soon tried to close down the museum, and Aki Ra was required to cease his 'uncertified' demining activities after being briefly imprisoned in 2001 and again in 2006. In 2005 he went to London where he was trained on ordnance disposal from the International School of Security and Explosives Education. In 2008 with the help of the Landmine Relief Fund, an American charity, and the Vietnam Veterans Mine Clearing Team – Cambodia, an Australian veterans group, he obtained full certification as a deminer and established a new NGO, Cambodian Self Help Demining (CSHD). It is certified by the Cambodian Mine Action Authority which also regularly inspects ordnance displayed in the museum. The Landmine Relief Fund has had a representative in the country working with CSHD. Generous support has also been provided by film producer Richard Fitoussi and film director Tom Shadyac. 
The Landmine Museum was relocated and reopened in 2008.
CSHD’s charter is to clear small villages, areas considered "low priority" for other international demining organizations, who are busy in "high priority" areas. In its first year of activity CSHD cleared 163,000 square meters of land and put over 2,400 people back on land that had been too dangerous to farm or live on. CSHD did this for an average cost of USD$ 4,314 per month.
CSHD is funded primarily by its American and Australian partners, the Landmine Relief Fund and the Vietnam Veterans Mine Clearing Team – Cambodia. In 2009 the United States Department of State, Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement granted the Landmine Relief Fund US$100,000 to help CSHD in their work to clear ERW (Explosive remnants of war) in "low priority villages" in Cambodia. Ongoing funding is uncertain as CSHD must compete with larger demining NGOs such as Mines Advisory Group and Halo Trust.
Recognition.
In 2005 the book "Children and the Akira Landmines Museum" was published in Japanese, listing Aki Ra as the principle author. 
The documentary film "A Perfect Soldier", describing Aki Ra's life, was released in 2010. 
In July 2010 Aki Ra was selected as a CNN Hero. In September he was chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero for 2010.
On August 12, 2012 Aki Ra was honored by the Manhae Foundation in South Korea with the 2012 Manhae Foundation Grand Prize for Peace. In February 2013 Aki Ra received the Paul P. Harris Fellowship for peace and conflict resolution from the Rotary Club of Gravenhurst, Ontario.
Personal life.
Aki Ra’s wife Hourt died on 15 April 2009 of complications related to a miscarriage. She was 28 years old. Hourt and Aki Ra have three children: Amatak, Mine, and Metta.
Mae Yourn (Mother Yourn), who lived and worked at the Cambodian Landmine Museum, died at the age of 66 in April 2010 from complications of diabetes.
The documentary film "A Perfect Soldier" implies that Aki Ra has suffered psychological problems, including depression, mood swings, nightmares and anxiety, as a result of his traumatic experiences as a soldier.
Several sources state that Aki Ra has had health problems due to his chronic, repeated exposure to explosive chemicals such as TNT and RDX.

USS Gemsbok (IX-117)

USS "Gemsbok" (IX-117), arguably the best "Armadillo"-class tanker designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gemsbok, a large, handsome species of straight-horned African antelope. Her keel was laid down as "Carl R. Gray" by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, in Wilmington, California. She was launched on 9 November 1943 sponsored by Miss E. Jeffers, acquired and simultaneously commissioned on 3 December 1943 with Commander A. H. Kooistra, USNR, in command. She was renamed "Gemsbok" upon acquisition.
"Gemsbok" sailed 12 January 1944 for the Marshall Islands and until May 1945 delivered fuel oil, aviation gasoline, and lube oil to warships in that archipelago and in the Mariana Islands. Her principal base of operations was Eniwetok but in addition "Gemsbok" supplied fuel at Majuro and Kwajalein, and from 5 July to 16 September 1944 was at Saipan servicing ships engaged in the capture and occupation of bases in the Marianas.
She sailed from Eniwetok on 11 May 1945 with fuel oil for Leyte, arriving 25 May via Ulithi. After Ulithi, she sailed from Leyte on 29 September for Okinawa and Hiro Wan, Japan, where she put in 16 October. "Gemsbok" continued her fueling duties at Nagoya and subsequently sailed for the United States on 20 December, reaching Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 February 1946 via San Diego, California, and Mobile, Alabama. Decommissioned there 30 April 1946, "Gemsbok" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 May 1946 and subsequently sold to Maris Transportation System Inc. and in 1948 renamed "Alpha".

Her keel was laid down as "Sanford B. Dole" by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, in Wilmington, California. She was launched on 11 November 1943 sponsored by Miss Mary F. Leddy and commissioned on 12 December 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Frederick F. Daly, USNR, commanding.
Following shakedown, "Giraffe" put in at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, on 10 February 1944 and subsequently refueled warships at Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Ulithi, and Palau before reaching Okinawa on 21 July 1945. She entered Sasebo, Japan, on 20 November at war's end and served the occupation fleet until departing Yokosuka on 21 February 1946 for Pearl Harbor and Norfolk, Virginia. "Giraffe" reached Norfolk 3 May and decommissioned there 17 June 1946. Returned to the War Department that date, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 July 1946. She was subsequently sold to Metro Petroleum Shipping Company, Inc.
"Giraffe" was awarded two battle stars for World War II service.

Alexander Gilmer

Alexander Gilmer (September 7, 1829 - July 30, 1906) was a sawmiller that became one of the United States' most successful individual timberland owners in his era.
Nicknamed "Sandy", he was born in County Armagh, Ireland, the son of George and Jane Gilmer. He immigrated to Georgia at the age of seventeen where he constructed shipmasts for the French government with his brother John. Together, they built a steamboat to work the Chattahoochee, but suffered a major setback when it sank, leaving Gilmer almost penniless. In the late 1840s, he migrated to Orange, Texas where he entered the shipbuilding business with his cousin George C. Gilmer. The two would shortly after enter the mercantile business and continue until the Civil War. Alexander participated in the war as a Confederate blockade runner in The Battle of Sabine Pass.
<br>
In 1866, Gilmer founded his first sawmill. He would eventually own sawmills and lumberyards in as many as ten communities. One of these, named Remlig (Gilmer spelled backwards) would become one of the largest businesses in Jasper County.
Gilmer had a series of economic setbacks. He lost his sawmill at Orange four times due to fire, after which he re-built his main operation at Lemonville (now a ghost town) in northern Orange County. <br> Alexander Gilmer was married twice. His first wife Etta Reading died within the first year of the marriage. His second wife Cleora C. Thomas bore 9 children, two of which died as infants. In his last days, Gilmer traveled to San Antonio due to health reasons before making his last business trip to New York City where he died in 1906. At the time of his death, he was the second wealthiest man in Orange, Texas. The Texas Historical Commission has constructed a marker to commemorate his business contributions.

The Wheels of Chance

The Wheels of Chance is an early comic novel by H. G. Wells about an August 1895 cycling holiday, somewhat in the style of "Three Men in a Boat". In 1922 it was adapted into a silent film "The Wheels of Chance" directed by Harold M. Shaw.
Plot introduction.
"The Wheels of Chance" was written at the height of the cycling craze (1890–1905), when practical, comfortable bicycles first became widely and cheaply available and before the rise of the automobile (see History of the bicycle). The advent of the bicycle stirred sudden and profound changes in the social life of England. Even the working class could travel substantial distances, quickly and cheaply, and the very idea of travelling for pleasure became a possibility for thousands of people for the first time. This new freedom affected many. It began to weaken the rigid English class structure and it gave an especially powerful boost to the existing movement toward
female emancipation. Wells explored these social changes in his story.
Plot.
The hero of "The Wheels of Chance", Mr. Hoopdriver, is a frustrated "draper's assistant" in Putney, a badly-paid, grinding position (and one which Wells briefly held); and yet he owns a bicycle and is setting out on a bicycling tour of "the Southern Coast" on his annual ten days' holiday.
Hoopdriver survives his frustration by escaping in his imagination into a world of fantasy. He is not a skilled rider of his forty-three-pound bicycle, and his awkwardness reflects both Wells's own uncertainties in negotiating the English class system and his critical view of that society. Nonetheless, Hoopdriver is treated sympathetically: "But if you see how a mere counter-jumper, a cad on castors, and a fool to boot, may come to feel the little insufficiencies of life, and if he has to any extent won your sympathies, my end is attained."
Hoopdriver's summer adventure begins lyrically:
Only those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all the year round, save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time, know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. All the dreary, uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall about your feet. . . . There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney Heath. The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass. . . . He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill, and his heart sang within him.
Hoopdriver encounters a pretty young woman cycling alone and wearing "rationals" (bloomers). He dares not speak to the Young Lady in Grey, as he calls her, but their paths keep crossing. She is ultimately revealed to be Jessie Milton, a girl of seventeen who has run away from her stepmother in Surbiton, risking "ruin" at the hands of the bounder Bechamel, an unscrupulous older man who has promised to help the naive Jessie to establish herself an independent life but who is really intent on seducing her. Ironically, her flight has in part been inspired by liberal ideals of unconventionality that have been hypocrtically promoted by her stepmother's popular novels.
Hoopdriver half-inadvertently rescues her from Bechamel's clutches, and the two proceed to cycle across the south of England. Ashamed of his true circumstances, Hoopdriver spins droll tales of South African origins and the comforts of wealth until shame induces him to confess his true circumstances. But he also displays genuine courage, rebuking insolent travellers who insult Jessie's honour.
Hoopdriver's encounter inspires in him a desire to better himself, as well as impossibly romantic feelings toward Jessie. At last a party consisting of her stepmother, some of her stepmother's admirers, and her former schoolteacher catches up with them. Jessie returns home and Hoopdriver returns to the Drapery Emporium of Messrs. Antrobud and Co., but Jessie has promised to "send him some books" and has held out the vague prospect that "in six years' time" things may be different.
Jessie's bookish and romantic education has kept her ignorant of the realities of life, and her ignorance contributes to the comedy of Hoopdriver's half-clever, half-ridiculous improvised stories of life in Africa. Jessie has her own aspirations: "She was going to Live her Own Life, with emphasis." H.G. Wells's intention in "The Wheels of Chance" might be taken to be satirical, were his protagonists' circumstances not so closely related to his own history and that of his second wife, Catherine Robbins.
Setting.
Wells used real places in plotting the novel, and the entire route can be followed on a map. Among the sites described in the novel are Ripley, Cobham, Guildford, Haslemere, Godalming, Milford, Midhurst, Chichester, Bognor (where, at the Vicuna Hotel, Hoopdriver comes to Jessie's rescue), Chichester Harbour, Havant, Botley, the hamlet of Wallenstock (where Hoopdriver defends Jessie's honour), Blandford (where Hoopdriver confesses his true identity to Jessie), Ringwood, Stoney Cross, and the Rufus Stone (where Hoopdriver says good-bye to Jessie).
Publication.
The novel was paired with "The Time Machine" and included in the Everyman's Library (no. 915) in 1935.
The text of "Wheels of Chance" is available at several sites on the internet.

He wrote several collections of poetry, translations of the Irish poets for the Cuala Press, and verses on Blasket Island. He first visited Blasket in 1910, at the recommendation of Carl Marstrander, his teacher at the School of Irish Learning in Dublin; he acquired there the Irish nickname Bláithín. He suggested a Norse origin for the name "Blasket". Under Flower's influence, George Derwent Thomson and Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson made scholarly visits to Blasket.
After his death his ashes were scattered on the Blasket Islands.
Works.
As a scholar of Anglo-Saxon, he wrote on the "Exeter Book" He identified interpolations in the Old English Bede, by Laurence Nowell. His work on Nowell included the discovery in 1934, in Nowell's transcription, of the poem "Seasons for Fasting".
He translated from the writings of Tomás Ó Criomhthain, his teacher on Blasket in Irish, and wrote a memoir, "The Western Island; Or, the Great Blasket" (1944), illustrated by his wife Ida. The essay collection "The Irish Tradition" (1947) is often cited, and was reprinted in 1994; it includes "Ireland and Medieval Europe", his "John Rhŷs Memorial Lecture" from 1927.

Cupressus cashmeriana (Bhutan cypress, Kashmir cypress, weeping cypress; Dzongkha language: "Tsenden") is a species of cypress native to the eastern Himalaya in Bhutan and adjacent areas of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India. It is also introduced in China and Nepal. It grows at moderately high altitudes of .
Description.
"Cupressus cashmeriana" is a medium-sized to large coniferous tree growing tall, rarely much more, with a trunk up to diameter. The foliage grows in strongly pendulous sprays of blue-green, very slender, flattened shoots. The leaves are scale-like, 1–2 mm long, up to 5 mm long on strong lead shoots; young trees up to about 5 years old have juvenile foliage with soft needle-like leaves 3–8 mm long.
The seed cones are ovoid, 10–21 mm long and 10–19 mm broad, with 8–12 scales, dark green, maturing dark brown about 24 months after pollination. The cones open at maturity to shed the seed. The pollen cones are 3–5 mm long, and release pollen in early spring.
A tree of tall has recently been reported, but the measurements await verification.
Symbolism and uses.
The Bhutan cypress is the official national tree of Bhutan, where it is often associated with Buddhist religious places. It has been widely planted around Vihara monasteries and Buddhist temples there for centuries.
Cultivation.
"Cupressus cashmeriana" is widely grown horticulturally as an ornamental tree, both within its native region and internationally in temperate climates. It is planted in private gardens and public parks. Many of the plants available outside of its native range are named cultivars, selected for particular forms, textures, or foliage colours, such as very pendulous branching or shoots, a fastigate or columnar shape, or a particularly bright blue or silvery glaucous foliage.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Conservation.
The natural populations of this species are fragmented. There are few occurrences and they contain few large individuals. Cypress wood is in demand locally.

Faugh A Ballagh

Faugh a Ballagh ( ; also written Faugh an Beallach) is a battle cry of Irish origin, meaning "clear the way". The spelling is an 18th-century anglicization of the Irish language phrase "Fág an Bealach" , also written "Fág a' Bealach". Its first recorded use as a regimental motto was by the Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1798. It remains the motto of the Royal Irish Regiment today.
It was adopted due to the blood curdling battle-cry of Sergeant Patrick Masterson as he tore into the French ranks, with Ensign Keogh, to capture the first French Imperial Eagle to be taken in battle – during the Battle of Barossa. He was then heard to cry 'Be Jabers Boys! I have the Cuckoo!' as he held it triumphantly aloft to rouse the spirits of his men. Ensign Keogh did not survive the daring dash into the French ranks.
It was popularized outside of Ireland during the American Civil War by the Army of the Potomac's Irish Brigade – composed of the 69th New York Volunteer Infantry (NYVI) or "Fighting 69th", the 63rd & 88th NYVI, and later the 116th Pennsylvania and 28th Massachusetts Infantry regiments. A variant transliteration of the motto, 'Faj an Bealac!' was inscribed on the regimental colors of the (Federal) 7th Missouri Volunteer Infantry, the "Irish Seventh", which fought in the Civil War's Western Theater as part of Grant and Sherman's Army of the Tennessee. 
The motto was also adopted by the 55th Battalion of the Australian 5th Division during the First World War.
Since then it has appeared rather infrequently in spoken language but has enjoyed some popularity in print, appearing on mugs, t-shirts, etc.
Historian and musician Derek Warfield released a book and companion CD, which he entitled "Clear the Way", dealing with the history of the 69th Regiment.
There is also a dam and a road in Bendigo, Australia which is named Faugh A Ballagh.
The phrase is referenced in the Dropkick Murphys' "The Legend of Finn MacCumhail" and "Heroes From Our Past"
The Irish language form of the phrase "Fág an Bealach" was used as the title of a recent two part documentary series on the Irish Brigade in the American Civil War broadcast on the Irish language television channel TG4.
The phrase is used in Irish Road Bowling to clear the road before a shot.
During the American Civil War in Company I, 8th Alabama Infantry Regiment, 104 of the 109 men were Irish Born. The men wore dark green uniforms; their banner was a Confederate Flag on one side with a full-length figure of George Washington in the center. The reverse was green, with a harp, shamrocks, and the slogans "Erin-go bragh" (Ireland forever) and "Faugh- a ballagh"- Clear the way.

Noel Joseph Jeddore (December 18, 1865 - May 14, 1944) was Saqamaw at Miawpukek (Conne River) from July 26, 1919 until he was forced into exile to Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, in 1924. He was born at Indian Point, Baie d'Espoir and he died at Eskasoni.
He was known as Saqamaw Geodol to the Mi'kmaq of Miawpukek. "The second chief is Geodol - called in English, Noel Jeddore - who represented Olibia in his absence. Geodol is the owner of one of the two cows on the Reservation, and his brother possesses the second".
During his leadership the position of Saqamaw within the Mi'kmaw community had become mostly that of a prayer leader, instead of the traditional political and settler of disputes, within the community. In 1923, according to an unpublished document written by his grandson John Nicholas Jeddore, some local residents caused serious misunderstanding between Saqamaw Geodol and the priest of the day, Father Stanislaus St. Croix.

G. Albert Aurier (5 May 1865 – 5 October 1892) was a poet, art critic and painter, devoted to Symbolism.
Career.
Son of a notary born in Châteauroux, Indre, Aurier went to Paris in 1883 to study law, but soon his attention was drawn to art and literature, and he began to contribute to Symbolist periodicals. He reviewed the annual Salon in Le Décadent, later he contributed to La Plume, in 1889 to Le Moderniste, and from its foundation in 1890, to the Mercure de France. There the essays were published, on which Aurier's fame as well as the fame of the artists discussed is founded: "Les Isolés: Vincent van Gogh" and "Le Symbolisme en peinture: Paul Gauguin".
After a trip to Marseille, Aurier died at the age of twenty-seven in Paris, on 5 October 1892, from a typhus infection. The next day, friends, writers and artists accompanied his coffin to the funeral train departing from the Orléans station (today Musée d'Orsay) for Châteauroux, where Aurier's remains were entombed in the family grave.
Six months after his death, in April 1893, his friends published his collected writings (Œuvres posthumes), edited by the Mercure de France.
Career.
Art collector.
Most of the Van Gogh paintings from Aurier's collection were acquired by Helene Kröller-Müller, and are now in the collections of the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (The Netherlands). Works by other artists from Aurier's estate - Émile Bernard, A. Fourmon, by unknown artists and Aurier himself - were first on public view in Paris, in 1960.

Gargoyles (comics)

Gargoyles is a comic book series by Slave Labor Graphics and Creature Comics, based on the 1990s animated television series "Gargoyles". It was written by series' creator Greg Weisman starting in 2006 and continued the storyline of show from the first two seasons, supplanting the ABC Network third season, "The Goliath Chronicles", which Weisman and most fans regard as non-canonical.
Storyline.
The continuation of the animated series, which picks up after the climactic three-part series finale, "Hunter's Moon", at the end of the second season. The first two issues of the comic translate the only third season ("The Goliath Chronicles") episode Weisman considers to be canon, "The Journey" (which he wrote), with issue #3 beginning the new storyline. Weisman has confirmed that the comic starts in 1996, just after the conclusion of the final episode of the series' second season. Issue #10 was the first issue set in 1997.
Production.
In June 2005, it was announced that a series of Disney-licensed, bi-monthly "Gargoyles" comic books would be created by Slave Labor Graphics in association with CreatureComics. "Gargoyles" #1 was released on June 21, 2006 and promptly sold out, ensuring a second printing. After an extended delay, "Gargoyles" #2 was released on December 13, 2006. Issue #6 contains an error: the artwork on page 12 and 16 was switched, even though the text is correct. Slave Labor has acknowledged this error, and the corrected issue was reprinted on November 14.
Greg Guler, character designer for the original TV series, and Stephanie Lostimolo have produced the cover art for each issue. Story art is primarily being produced by David Hedgecock and colored by Dustin Evans, although issues #4, #5, and #6 were drawn by guest artists. "Gargoyles" #6 used the unpublished script that Weisman wrote for the Marvel series.
In August 2008, Greg Weisman announced that, due to Disney increasing its licensing fees, Slave Labor Graphics would not be renewing its license of "Gargoyles" after it ran out on August 31, 2008. The final two issues of "Bad Guys" and four of "Gargoyles" were released in the comic trades collecting both series in August 2009. Weisman also stated that SLG President Dan Vado has not given up on the "Gargoyles" franchise, and hopes to pursue the idea of "Gargoyles" graphic novels in the future.
Spin-offs.
One of Greg Weisman's planned "Gargoyles" spin-offs, "Bad Guys", has debuted as a black-and-white six-issue limited series. The first issue was released on November 28, 2007. The series is written by Weisman and drawn by Karine Charlebois, with cover art by Greg Guler and Stephanie Lostimolo.
Had the comics continued, "Gargoyles: Pendragon" would have been next in line, followed by "Gargoyles: Timedancer". Each of these would have also appeared as a six-issue black-and-white limited series.
Issues.
Note that "Gargoyles" issues #9–12 and "Bad Guys" issues #5–6 were only published in the collections.

<doc id="5976269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5976269" title="Lady Sarah McCorquodale">
Lady Sarah McCorquodale

The Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale (née Spencer; born 19 March 1955) is the elder sister of Diana, Princess of Wales.
Early life.
Sarah was born The Honourable Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia Spencer; she acquired the courtesy title The Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia Spencer in 1975, when her grandfather died and her father became the 8th Earl Spencer. She suffered from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa in her early twenties. She was educated firstly at Riddlesworth Hall School in Norfolk and secondly at West Heath boarding school near Sevenoaks in Kent. She left West Heath after passing O Level exams to work in London.
Family.
Sarah married Neil Edmund McCorquodale (born 1951), son of Alastair McCorquodale and Rosemary Sybil Turnor, on 17 May 1980 in Northamptonshire, England. Neil McCorquodale is a nephew of Lady Sarah's stepmother, Raine Spencer.
Neil McCorquodale and Lady Sarah McCorquodale have three children
She and her family reside near Grantham, Lincolnshire where she served a one year term as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 2009. She is a master of the Belvoir Hunt.
Prince Harry bears a striking resemblance to her, as does her son, George. Lady Sarah was accompanied by her husband and children to the Service of Thanksgiving for the Life of Diana at Westminster Abbey on 6 September 1997.
Relationships.
Diana, Princess of Wales.
In 1977, Sarah's relationship with Prince Charles led to the first meeting between Diana and her future husband. During the period in which she dated the prince, she allegedly met two reporters, James Whittaker and Nigel Nelson, at a restaurant and gave them an exclusive report on her royal connection. She is said to have admitted to having been diagnosed with anorexia, having "thousands of boyfriends", a past problem involving alcohol, and that she had started keeping a scrapbook of all the press clippings about her royal romance that she intended to "show" future grandchildren. "Her head seemed to be turned by the publicity", the two reporters later said. When the article was released, she showed it to the prince and he replied, "You've just done something incredibly stupid". The relationship dissolved soon after that. Some have stated the relationship between her and Diana was strained, because of her long resentment of the Prince marrying Diana and not her, though others (including Diana's biographer Andrew Morton) have said she was one of the few people Diana trusted. Later in Diana's life, she often accompanied Diana on official visits as one of her Ladies in Waiting.
Upon the death of Diana on 31 August 1997, Sarah flew to Paris with her younger sister, Jane, and Prince Charles to accompany Diana's body back to England. She contributed to the readings at Diana's funeral. She was co-executor of Diana's will and is president of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Sarah also attended the wedding of her nephew Prince William to Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011.
Other siblings.
Sarah has shared a lifelong close relationship with her younger sister Lady Jane. Author Anne Edwards, who wrote a best selling biography on the life of Diana, said Diana's two older sisters were extremely close and loyal to each other. Sarah gave her first child, Emily, the middle name of 'Jane' in a tribute to her younger sister. Her relationship with younger brother Earl Spencer has been volatile at the best of times. As the eldest and the youngest of the Spencer children, they have clashed frequently in adulthood and childhood. In recent years, possibly due to the death of their sister, the siblings appear to have settled previous differences.

<doc id="5976289" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5976289" title="Clement Clerke">
Clement Clerke

Sir Clement Clerke, 1st Baronet (died 1693) was an important (but financially unsuccessful) English entrepreneur, whose greatest achievement was the application of the reverberatory furnace (cupola) to smelting lead and copper, and to remelting pig iron for foundry purposes.
Background.
Clement Clerke was the third son of George Clerke of Willoughby, Warwickshire, and was created a baronet shortly after the Restoration. He was married to Sarah, daughter and heiress of George Talbot of Rudge, Shropshire. In 1657, he bought the Launde Abbey estate in Leicestershire in 1658 and this was settled on him and his wife. They had another estate at Notgrove in Gloucestershire.
Iron smelting.
In the early 1670s, Sir Clement joined various other people in sponsoring Dud Dudley to build a furnace at Dudley to smelt iron using a mixed fuel made from wood and coal. This (uniquely) was to be powered by the strength of men and of horses. By 1674 Sir Clement and John Finch of Dudley were the only partners. Finch had other ironworks, but competition between him and Philip Foley was damaging to them both; this led them to enter into a restrictive agreement as to where they would respectively buy wood and generally limiting their activities. A few months later, John Finch sold all his works to Alderman John Foorth (of London) and Sir Clement Clerke. They also bought wood in the Forest of Dean, bit found that the King's Ironworks there had been sold to Paul Foley for demolition and had to build their own furnace at Linton, Herefordshire. They then brought in further partners including John's brother Dannett Foorth and George Skippe of Ledbury. They also bought further ironworks from Philip Foley. This proved to be a troubled business because Sir Clement borrowed money from moneylenders on the security of his share (in breach of the terms of the partnership agreement). This led Dannett Foorth having him Sir Clement arrested for debt, and George Skippe bailing him out. These difficulties were resolved by the sale of the ironworks in 1676, and the dissolution of the partnership.
The River Stour.
During their partnership, Andrew Yarranton persuaded John Foorth and Sir Clement Clerke to finance the completion of the navigation of the Worcestershire Stour. This would have been a convenience for them, as it ran near some of their works, but nothing was done except pay off some debts, due to the problems with the ironworks business. On its dissolution, George Skippe took over Foorth’s share in the navigation; new contractors (including Andrew Yarranton’s son Robert, and they were to be paid by instalments as the works progressed, but the money ran out when the river was only completed from Stourbridge to Kidderminster.
Lead smelting.
By this stage, Sir Clement had exhausted his resources; the manor of Rudge was ultimately foreclosed by the mortgagee. Lord Grandison had financed a certain Samuel Hutchinson, who had a patent for smelting lead with pitcoal, but failed. Grandison then approached Sir Clement. Grandison and Robert Thorowgood (a King's Lynn merchant) provided the capital in 1678 for Sir Clement and Francis Nicholson (Grandison's dependent) to set up lead works. Sir Clement went to Bristol and built cupolas - reverberatory furnaces, but when Sir Clement went back for the rest of the capital, he found that Nicholson had taken it to Derbyshire and lost it.
In 1683, there was a complicated agreement to the effect that business should be carried on by Sir Clement's son Talbot, but he was not quite 21 years old so that the business had to be in the name of a trustee. The business was in fact profitable. Talbot sought to declare a dividend, but Lord Grandison and his fellow financier, Hon. Henry Howard demanded that they be repaid money that they said Sir Clement owed them. This led to litigation, during the course of which one Gravely Claypoole was appointed by the court to run the works for Grandison. The litigation was ultimately resolved in Talbot's favour.
Another venture related to the production of white lead. This was in the names of Talbot's trustee an Grandison's son Edward Fitzgerald Villiers, but was evidently not successful, with the result that money had to be obtained by mortgaging Launde Abbey to repay Villiers.
Copper and company flotations.
In 1687, while the lead cupola was out of their possession, Sir Clement and Talbot built a reverberatory furnace at Putney and smelted copper there. A patent was obtained for this in 1688. This led to the establishment of a copper smelting works close to the banks of the River Wye at Redbrook and the chartering of the English Copper Company.
With the conclusion of the litigation, the cupola near Bristol reverted to Talbot Clerke. The Company for Smelting down Lead with Pitcoal (later in different ownership known as the London Lead Company) was chartered to run this, but this was evidently not successful and returned to Talbot (by then Sir Talbot) in 1695.
'A work for remelting and casting old iron with sea coal' was built at 'Fox Hall' (probably Vauxhall under the direction of Sir Clement. This was the first reverberatory furnace (in this case known as an 'air furnace') to be built for iron foundry purposes. This seems to have formed the basis for the Company for Making Iron with Pitcoal, though it may also have been intended to exploit a patent granted to Thomas Addison in 1692. The company ran its foundry for a few years, with Thomas Fox (the brother of Shadrach Fox of Coalbrookdale) as founder.
Impact.
Sir Clement apparently guided many of these developments; though he probably did not personally benefit from them financially, his sons probably did. Sir Clement is certainly to be credited with the practical application of the reverberatory furnace (or cupola) to several metallurgical processes. Until the introduction in the late 18th century of the foundry cupola (which is a sort of small blast furnace), his air furnace was the normal way of remelting pig for foundry purposes. The cupola (reverberatory furnace) long remained in use for smelted copper and lead, and was applied by Robert Lyddall to tin.
It is not clear where he obtained his knowledge of metallurgy, but it is possible that Dud Dudley was his teacher; certainly, his lead smelting efforts seem to be foreshadowed by an enterprise involving Dud Dudley at Okham Slade (location unknown) in Clifton, Bristol. Sir Clement died in debt in 1693. His baronetcy passed to Talbot, as did Launde Abbey, which was not swallowed by his debts because of his marriage settlement.

Forbury Gardens

Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church. The site was formerly known as the Forbury, and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury. Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century.
Forbury, a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin, was named after the gardens by early resident William Henry Valpy, who was born in Reading.
History.
Reading Abbey was founded in 1121, by Henry I, and for the next four centuries it dominated the town, becoming one of the most influential establishments in England. Like other such monasteries, Reading had a "forbury", or 'borough in front', an area of open land which provided a meeting place between the Abbey and the town. The Forbury in Reading was part of the outer court of the Abbey, and provided a market place as well as a meeting place. 
In 1150, what is now Forbury Hill was constructed to help fortify the Abbey during the civil war between King Henry I's daughter, Matilda, and his nephew, Stephen.
The abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church. After this, the buildings of the abbey were extensively robbed, with lead, glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere, and the focus of the town moved away from the Forbury.
Reading suffered badly during the English Civil War, being occupied at different time by both sides. During the Siege of Reading (1642-3), the Royalist garrison built defences that further damaged the remains of the Abbey, and Forbury Hill was used as a gun emplacement.
As a result of the concerns sparked in England by the French Revolution, and throughout the ensuing Napoleonic Wars, the Forbury was used for military drills and parades, in addition to its well-established use for fairs and circuses. Three annual fairs were generally held on the Forbury, but the most significant was the "Michaelmas Fair", held in September. This fair became known as the "Reading Cheese Fair", although cattle, horses and hops were also sold, and it served as the principal local hiring fair.
By the first years of the 19th century, the western part of the Forbury was in use as a playground or sports ground for Reading School, which at this time was housed in the former Hospitium of St John. However the whole of the Forbury was in private ownership, and disputes were common as to the common rights of the town and the rights of the school.
In 1854, Forbury Hill and the eastern section of the present gardens were sold to Reading Corporation at the cost of £1200, of which £400 was donated by the previous owner, a Mr Wheble. The resulting gardens were planned with a 'botanical character', a fountain and a summer house, and became known as the Pleasure Gardens. Work started in 1855 and the Pleasure Gardens opened on Easter Sunday 1856. A tunnel was built on the eastern side in 1859 to link the gardens and the Abbey ruins.
The success of the Pleasure Gardens contrasted with the situation in the western part of the Forbury, which was still used for fairs. After one fair, the area was described as being covered 'with heaps of oyster shells, manure and other refuse'. In 1860, this section of the Forbury was purchased by the town for £6010 from Colonel Blagrave. It was decided that fairs should no longer be held there, but the emphasis remained on recreational use rather than botanical display, with the area grassed except for the outside walks and a gravelled parade ground.
The common ownership notwithstanding, the two halves of the Forbury remained very different in character, and separated by a wall. However in 1869 the town purchased of King's Meadow, the abbey's former water meadow by the River Thames, as a recreation ground. This paved the way for the incorporation, in 1873, of the western part of the Forbury into the gardens, which then became known as Forbury Gardens.
The Maiwand Lion statue was erected in 1886 to commemorate the loss of 286 soldiers (though the exact number varies by account) from the 66th Royal Berkshire Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan on the 27 July 1880. The sculptor of this 31-foot statue was George Blackall Simonds and was unveiled in December 1886. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.
A cross memorializing Henry I was put up, at about the same time as the Maiwand Lion, on the north-west corner of the footings of the Abbey Church. The Victoria Gates on the southern side of the gardens commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The shields on the gates are those of the Borough and the Abbey.
The gardens today.
A grand re-opening event took place on May 14, 2005, to mark the completion of a one-year restoration project. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Reading Borough Council £2.13 million to restore the historic features of the Forbury Gardens and improve safety and access for visitors. The scheme was developed in consultation with residents and interested local groups.
Work in the gardens themselves has included the restoration of the Maiwand Lion, the bandstand, water feature and the garden's walls, fencing and gateways. A new Keeper's Lodge also includes a refreshment kiosk, public toilets and facilities for a resident gardener. Reading Borough Council organises summer concerts in the bandstand on Sunday afternoons during July and August.
After the restoration, closed-circuit cameras monitor the whole Gardens area, in a bid to deter the drug users and other miscreants that used to make ordinary people fearful of using the public gardens. The garden has received a Green Flag Award for being welcoming, safe, well maintained and involving the community.
Forbury Gardens is home to Reading's YouTube gatherings, which are frequently held throughout the year. These gatherings are known as 'Sassy' and then would either have the name of the month or a celebration, e.g. Christmas. Forbury Garden's largest YouTube gathering was in June 2013, an estimated 200 people attended, although there was an expected number of at least 500 people to descend on the gardens. 
The Forbury Hill is now accessible by two winding footpaths (wheelchair-accessible) that lead to an area that is elevated about 3 metres above the surrounding gardens. A single plane tree stands in the middle, and around the outer edge of the top of the hill are wooden seats.
It was announced in May 2014 that the gardens will be the site of the Trooper Fred Potts VC statue.

Ducati Sporting Club DesmoDue Championship

The 'DesmoDue Championship' is a one-make motorcycle racing series based in the United Kingdom. The series was started by the Ducati Sporting Club in 2005 and is administered by them, staging races through New Era MCC meetings in the UK until 2010, and therefater with Hottrax Motorsport.
The motorcycles must be based on an air-cooled 2-valve Ducati twin-cylinder engine produced since 1992. The machines are allowed limited modifications. Most modifications are for safety reasons. The control tyre, which changed to a Dunlop Sportsmax Qualifier for the 2011 season, is used in all weather conditions.
Three capacity classes compete for the championship;
Riders must hold an ACU racing licence, and be either a Clubman or Novice licence holder absent special dispensation by the race committee.
History.
The series began in 2005 after mechanical rules had been set in late 2004 by Neil Spalding of Sigma. This innovative series consisted of 11 races at circuits including, Cadwell Park, Castle Combe, Snetterton, Donington Park and Brands Hatch. 41 riders took part. The inaugural series was won by a dominant Geoff Spencer, who took 8 races.
2006.
In 2006 the series moved to two machine classes (Class A and B) and almost 50 riders. The circuit line-up expanded to include Oulton Park and the TT circuit of Assen in the Netherlands. The Dutch round of the series was hosted by the Ducati Club Nederland at their famous Club Races.
Phil Huntley became the inaugural 583cc Champion, winning 9 races, whilst Dominic Cann, for Charles Dudley's OD2 team, was crowned 620cc Champion with 8 wins. The two riders went head-to-head in the season finale at Cadwell Park. Huntley qualified for Pole Position. Cann won both races and went on to score 32 consecutive podium finishes over two and a half seasons.
2007.
2007 Class A champion was Kyle Hinton, who smashed virtually all records riding for Alan & Charlotte Knight of the Knight RR Team, taking 11 victories from 13 starts, winning the last 7 races in a row and setting 5 new class lap records on the 620 Monster. The 583cc championship was wrapped up by Andy Sheppard who won 6 races, took 11 podiums and 5 Pole Positions.
2008.
The 2008 season saw the Desmodue series given a large stamp of approval by the participation of repeat British champion and ex-International star Ian Cobby. Riding in the 620 series, having entered a one-off race the year before on a 583 machine at Oulton Park, Ian secured the title with one round still to go taking 9 races and 12 podiums. The ex BSB rider did not have things all his own way though and was repeatedly threatened by 2005 season 4th place finisher, Mike Dawson, who won at Mallory Park, Pembrey and Cadwell Park. Richard Fogg also won a single inspired race in wet conditions at Brands Hatch. Mike almost ran Ian Cobby to the wire except for a bike blow up. He eventually came 2nd in the championship. 2007 B class champion, Andy Sheppard won his first A class race at the Cadwell Park finale, giving an indication of his future. The 583 championship was secured by Matt Traynar, who despite enjoying a 92cc advantage over most of his rivals managed not to win all of the races that year. Dominic Clegg put up a good fight to take second place, winning 5 races. Harriet Ridley became the first woman to take a top 3 championship position and showed that she was becoming a force to be reckoned with.
2009.
2009 started with Andy Sheppard winning first time out at Donington Park. Tim Pritchard, started his first full season in Desmodue, having contested only the occasional rounds in previous seasons, won the next race that day and set in motion what would become an epic struggle. Pritchard suffered a slight dip in form at the midpoint, allowing Sheppard to take the upper hand. After discovering a bike set up to suit him though, Tim came back strongly at the end of the season with the midsummer races at Cadwell Park. 80% of the crowd fainted. Sheppard took the title at Pembrey, despite Pritchard winning both races.
In a dramatic twist to the end of the season, it transpired that Sheppard had been suffering with a heart defect and needed an immediate operation. Andy put the operation off to try to win the title, and in doing so became the first rider to win both the B class and A class championships. He was then medically prohibited from entering races and his number 65 was retired as a mark of respect. Andy and Tim were the only riders to win races in 2009, taking 11 and 7 respectively. The 583 championship was taken by Sam West, coming back from a horrific testing smash at Snetterton the year before that broke his leg into approximately 786 pieces. It was far from an easy ride though, with crashes and mechanical failures threatening to let Harriet Ridley through. Sam's misfortunes often came in non-championship races and won out with 10 wins. Harriet took runner up with 5 wins and held the consolation prize of “finest booty ever to grace a DD bike”.
2010.
2010 was the fifth year of the series, and became a battle between Tim Pritchard and Mark Lister. Mark hurtled into the series at the first round, winning both races (on the OD2 prepared bike of 2006 title winning team boss, Chas Dudley), despite crashing in qualifying. He set a new lap record, beating Spencer’s 2005 mark. Tim won the next 2 races at Silverstone, but couldn’t match Lister’s pace at Mallory Park where Mark easily won both races. Pritchard was injured in a nasty starting line smash during the second non-championship race at Snetterton, allowing Mark an easy yet inevitable cruise to the title as Tim missed the next 3 rounds. The series hadn’t seen such raw pace since Ian Cobby entered the series in 2008 and even a healthy Pritchard would have been a longshot. Tim regained some pride at the end of the season though, winning his first race back from injury against Neil Appleby, whose progress over the season netted him the runner up spot. The 583 title was between several riders. The ones that mattered in the end were Matt “Awesome” Lawson, and Matt Larrett. Larrett took the title in a foul weather showdown at Cadwell Park. They took 3 and 5 wins each, respectively.
2011.
The 2011 championship was run through New Era, but the majority of races were held with Hottrax Racing. The control tyre also changed to a Dunlop Sportsmax Qualifier, moving away from Pirelli for the first time. The finale at Oulton Park saw Class B rider Philip Wilcock take two wins and the championship by four points from Ron Jolley, who fell from a 20 second lead in the final race. Class A was won by Appleby 36 points above veteran Andy Challis.
2012.
The 2012 championship added the Class C category, a step-up for those wanting to race larger capacity bikes. The bikes were still Ducati with rules to limit costs. The motorcycle must be either a water cooled Ducati twin cylinder motorcycle with 4 valves per cylinder produced between 1988 and March 2002 or an air-cooled 2 valve Ducati twin cylinder produced between 1992 and March 2005, displacing no more than 997cc. The machines are allowed limited modifications, for safety or to allow older generations of the Desmo family to remain competitive with the newer machines. Specifically, these are:
4 Valve 748: - Any model with the exception of the 748RS
851 / 888 : - Any production model
916: - Any model with the exception of 916 Racing and SPS
996: - Any model with the exception of SP, SPS, R & RS
2 Valve 748 & 904 cc single spark engine SS & Monster, including both carburettor and injection models.
803cc single spark SS & Monster manufactured prior to March 2008.
992 twin spark engine SS, Monster & Multistrada manufactured prior to March 2005

Calmness

Calmness is the mental state of being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance. It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquility, or peace. Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states. Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.
Calmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice. It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are prayer, yoga, relaxation training, breath training, and meditation. Jon Kabat-Zinn states that “Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.” 
Another term usually associated with calmness is "Peace". A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce "good" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including marriage. Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control', it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.
Etymology.
The term comes from Middle English calme, from Old French, from Old Italian calmo, from Late Latin cauma, "heat of the day", the "resting place in the heat of the day", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn, from Middle English calme, from Italian calma, from Vulgar Latin calma, from Late Latin.

International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas

The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), a member of the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, supported by the CGIAR Fund, is a non-profit agricultural research for development institute that aims to improve the livelihoods of the resource-poor across the world’s dry areas.
ICARDA has been temporarily headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, since leaving Aleppo, Syria, in 2012. Support is provided by research centers and offices in Jordan, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Oman, Pakistan, Sudan, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. 
Established in 1977, ICARDA’s origins lie in a 1973 study that highlighted the food security challenges faced by countries across the dry regions of the Near East and North Africa. ICARDA research activities include the development of new crop varieties, water harvesting, conservation agriculture, the diversification of production systems, integrated crop/rangeland/livestock production systems, and the empowerment of rural women. 
Research Programs.
Biodiversity and Integrated Gene Management: 
The Biodiversity and Integrated Gene Management Program works to conserve agricultural biodiversity in dry areas and to use these resources to improve food security, nutrition, and livelihoods through breeding. It covers durum and bread wheat, barley, chickpea, lentil, faba bean, grasspea, and forage and pasture crops. ICARDA scientists work on biodiversity conservation as well as crop improvement. Activities take both conventional and biotechnological approaches, and include integrated disease and pest management, and seed production and delivery systems to enhance the adoption of new varieties. 
Integrated Water and Land Management:
The Water and Land Management program aims to improve the management of scarce water resources, and to combat desertification and land degradation. ICARDA scientists develop technical, institutional, and policy options for improved water productivity in both rainfed and irrigated production systems; for sustainable, equitable, and economic use of all water sources; and for improved land management and drought mitigation. Research focuses on appropriate, effective technologies, such as supplemental irrigation and rainwater harvesting. 
Diversification and Sustainable Intensification of Production Systems:
The Diversification and Sustainable Intensification of Production Systems Program focuses on improving livelihoods, and reducing risk by intensifying and diversifying traditional production systems. Research covers agronomy, integrated crop-livestock-rangeland systems, market linkages, supporting diversification into higher value crops, and creating new income opportunities through value adding to crop and livestock products. 
Social, Economic, and Policy Research:
The Social, Economic, and Policy Research Program aims to better understand rural poverty, livelihood strategies, and gender and youth issues to improve the targeting of research and development investments and accelerate technology adoption. Activities include poverty mapping, value-chain and market analysis, and policy and institutional options in agriculture. Adoption and impact studies help identify barriers to the adoption of new technologies, provide lessons for the design of research and development programs, and provide quantitative evidence of the returns to research investments.
Decentralization.
ICARDA’s decentralization builds on and strengthens the Center’s existing organization. Staff have been relocated to Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey, and the Center has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. 
Adoption of a more decentralized system will enhance the relevance, effectiveness, and impact of ICARDA’s research activities; better target diverse environments; and better align the Center with target areas in the CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) in which ICARDA is involved, including the ICARDA-led CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems.
Integrated Research Platforms.
As part of its decentralization, ICARDA has established integrated research platforms that address research priorities in each region, but serve dry areas globally through collaboration and partnerships with national programs, advanced research institutions, and other partners in the development and dissemination of international public goods. 
The Center has developed four major Platforms, including the headquarters:
Headquarters (West Asia): ICARDA has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon, and expanded facilities and activities in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Syria and Jordan also host a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site. 
North Africa with a Platform in Morocco: Building on the existing partnership with INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique), and focused on the intensification and diversification of rainfed cereal-based production systems. Morocco also hosts a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site.
Sub-Saharan Africa, with a Platform in Ethiopia: Building on the partnership with ILRI in the CRP on Livestock and Fish and on-going collaboration with the Ethiopia Agricultural Research Institute (EIAR). Ethiopia also hosts a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site. 
South Asia, with a Platform in India: Building on the existing partnership with ICAR (India Center for Agricultural Research), and focused especially on food legumes systems. India also hosts two CRP Dryland Systems Action Sites.
Thematic research locations.
Under ICARDA's decentralization strategy, the Center is operating four additional research locations with specific themes: 
Egypt, for high-input agriculture: a platform with a targeted focus on high-input irrigated agricultural systems, building on collaborative research on irrigated wheat improvement and irrigated systems management. 
Turkey, Central Asia and Iran for Winter Wheat and Winter Barley: a distinct environment with extensive high altitude and highland agro-ecologies with severe winters particularly suitable for breeding winter wheat and winter barley.
Turkey/ICARDA Cereal Rusts Research Center in Izmir: Providing expertise on wheat rusts through the Regional Cereal Rust Research Center within the Aegean Agricultural Research Institute, part of Turkey’s Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock. 
Sudan Heat Tolerance Research Location: This research location breeds heat-tolerant wheat and food legume varieties, in collaboration with Sudan’s Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC)

Exterminator (roller coaster)

The Exterminator is a steel roller coaster located at Kennywood Park, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The ride was developed by Reverchon Industries.
The ride is heavily themed around the concept of the rider as a rat attempting to escape from Kennywood exterminators. The concept is a pun off of the phrase "Wild Mouse roller coaster", which describes this type of coaster, characterized by small cars (4 people/car for Exterminator) and sharp turns. Much of the theming takes place in the line for the ride, which includes such elaborate media as fake news broadcasts, and is usually the park's longest, being usually or beyond a 40 minute wait. The ride is very dark and unique, as the introduction says "unlike any ride you've rode before". The tracks are fast, rough, include a few sudden falls, and end with a fast finale that includes flashing lights, and the car seemingly spinning out of control. Like other spinning wild mouse coasters, the cars face forwards for the first half of the ride, but are free to spin during the second half.

Elephant (science book)

Elephant is a 1964 science book by L. Sprague de Camp, published by Pyramid Books as part of The Worlds of Science series.
The book treats its subject comprehensively, covering elephants in captivity and the wild, their use in ancient warfare, modern conflicts between elephants and farmers, and preservation efforts, among other topics. It is "esigned for the general reader and student, about the various aspects of the world's largest land animal, from fossils to captive elephants."
While a decent study, the book is important more for its insight into the mind of the author than in its own right, elephants being a lifelong interest of de Camp's that figures in many of his other literary works. In his early time travel novel "Lest Darkness Fall" his protagonist Martin Padway pens a similar monograph, while in his historical novel "An Elephant for Aristotle" details the difficulties in transporting an elephant from India to Greece during ancient times. De Camp also wrote a number of articles about elephants, a few of which appeared, together with a chapter selected from the present work, in his later collection "The Fringe of the Unknown" (1983).

<doc id="5976324" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5976324" title="Adder stone">
Adder stone

An adder stone is a type of stone, usually glassy, with a naturally occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt. Commonly, they are found in Northern Germany at the coasts of the North and Baltic Seas.
In Britain they are also called hag stones, witch stones, serpent's eggs, snake's eggs, or Glain Neidr in Wales, milpreve in Cornwall, adderstanes in the south of Scotland and Gloine nan Druidh ("Druids' glass" in Scottish Gaelic) in the north. In Egypt they are called aggry or aggri.
Adder stones were believed to have magical powers such as protection against eye diseases or evil charms, preventing nightmares, curing whooping cough, the ability to see through fairy or witch disguises and traps if looked at through the middle of the stone, and of course recovery from snakebite. According to popular conception, a true adder stone will float in water.
Three traditions exist as to the origins of adder stones. One holds that the stones are the hardened saliva of large numbers of serpents massing together, the perforations being caused by their tongues. The second claims that an adder stone comes from the head of a serpent or is made by the sting of an adder. The third is more modern (and much easier to attain). It details that the stone can be any rock with a hole bored through the middle by water. Human intervention (i.e., direction of water or placement of the stone) is not allowed.
Adder stone was held in high esteem amongst the Druids. It was one of their distinguishing badges, and was accounted to possess the most extraordinary virtues. There is a passage in Pliny’s "Natural History", book xix, minutely describing the nature and the properties of this amulet. The following is a translation of it:
Huddleston's edition of Toland gives some very ingenious conjectures on the subject of this very enigmatical Druids' egg. The amulets of glass and stone, which are still preserved and used with implicit faith in many parts of Scottish Gaeldom, and are conveyed, for the cure of diseases to a great distance, seem to have their origin in this bauble of ancient priestcraft.
In Welsh mythology.
The Glain Neidr or 'Maen Magi' of Welsh folklore is also closely connected to Druidism. The Glain Neidr of Wales are believed to be created by a congress of snakes, normally occurring in spring, but more auspicial on May Eve. 
Although not named as Glain Neidr, magic stones with the properties of adder stones appear frequently in Welsh mythology and folklore. The Mabinogion, translated into English in the mid-nineteenth century by Lady Charlotte Guest, mentions such stones on two occasions. In the story of Peredur son of Efrawg (Percival of Arthurian legend), in a departure from Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Peredur is given a magical stone that allows him to see and kill an invisible creature called the Addanc. In another tale, Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain, (Ynwin of Arthurian legend), the hero Owain is trapped in the gatehouse of a castle. He is given a stone by a maiden, which turns Owain invisible, allowing him to escape capture.

Zala County (former)

Zala was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in southwestern Hungary, northern Croatia and eastern Slovenia. The territory of the county comprised what is now the Hungarian county Zala and part of Veszprém county, the Croatian region of Međimurje to the south-west of it, bordered by the river Drave, and a small region around Lendava in Slovenia. The capital of the county was Zalaegerszeg.
Geography.
Zala county shared borders with the Austrian land Styria and the Hungarian counties Vas, Veszprém, Somogy, Belovár-Körös and Varasd (the latter two in Croatia-Slavonia). The river Drave formed its southern border, Lake Balaton its eastern border. The rivers Mura and Zala flowed through the county. Its area was 5974 km² around 1910.
History.
Zala county arose as one of the first "comitati" of the Kingdom of Hungary.
In 1918 (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon 1920), the south-west of the county became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia). The remainder stayed in Hungary. Yugoslavian part of it was occupied again by Hungary between 1941 and 1945 during World War II. In 1950, as part of the Communist reforms of local government, the county's borders were re-drawn again. A small part of former Vas county, north of Zalaegerszeg, went to Zala county. The part of Zala county north of Lake Balaton went to Veszprém County.
Since 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia became independent from Yugoslavia, the part of former Zala county between the rivers Mura and Drave is part of Croatia (region of Međimurje). The area around Lendava is in Slovenia.
Demographics.
In 1900, the county had a population of 437,116 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities:

Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes

Cynthia Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes (née Spencer; born 11 February 1957) is one of the two older sisters of Diana, Princess of Wales.
Early life and education.
Lady Fellowes is the daughter of Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924–1992) and Hon. Frances Ruth Burke Roche (1936–2004). Her parents married in 1954 but divorced in 1969. She has always used her middle name of Jane (just as her elder sister also uses one of her middle names). One of Jane's godparents is Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. She was a bridesmaid at his 1961 wedding to Katharine Worsley.
Like her sisters, Lady Fellowes was educated at West Heath boarding school near Sevenoaks in Kent. Sources say she was an excellent student, achieving the status of school Prefect and passing a good number of A-level exams. To paraphrase Andrew Morton, Lady Fellowes acquired a "hatful" of O-level and A-level exams. Her successful exams suggest that she is the most academically gifted of the three sisters.
Marriage and children.
In March 1978, Jane married her distant relation Robert Fellowes (b. 1941), then assistant private secretary to the Queen. During the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, Jane's sister Diana was a bridesmaid. Photos of Diana as her sister's bridesmaid can be seen at this website and in many books about the life of Diana, Princess of Wales.
In June 1999, Robert Fellowes was granted a Life Peerage as Baron Fellowes, of Shotesham in the County of Norfolk, after first being knighted as Sir Robert Fellowes.
Lord and Lady Fellowes have three children, all of whom bear the style of "The Honourable" since June 1999 as the children of a Life Peer:
These children are maternal first cousins of Prince William and Prince Harry.
Lady Diana Spencer came up to Scotland in the summer of 1980 to help with her sister's newborn daughter, Laura Jane and, during that time, was allegedly courted by the Prince of Wales.
Relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales.
Lady Fellowes is the only member of the Spencer family who has never spoken to the media about the death of Diana or her life. After Diana's death, conflicting views about the two sisters' relationship have been voiced by different people. Diana's butler Paul Burrell stated that the relationship was strained because of Lord Fellowes's position as secretary to the Queen and that by the time of Diana's death they had not even spoken in a number of years. On the other hand, Diana's childhood nanny, Mary Clarke, author of memoirs about the nanny's experience raising Diana, stated that the relations between the Baroness and Diana were not as bitter as Burrell and others have said or assumed. It is not clear when their relationship deteriorated (if it did), but the sisters were neighbours on the Kensington Palace estate, with Diana living at Numbers 8 and 9, and Lady Fellowes living at a house called the Old Barracks. According to her 1998 interview, when Lady Fellows announced the news of Diana's death to their brother Charles, Earl Spencer: "I'm afraid that's it, she's dead." 
Sarah and Lady Fellowes flew to Paris with their former brother-in-law Prince Charles to escort Diana's body back for the public funeral. Many witnesses reported that Lady Fellowes was very upset and needed to be assisted into a chair after seeing Diana's body at the hospital in Paris. Sarah and Lady Fellowes played a part in the public funeral ceremony. Since Diana's death, Lord and Lady Fellowes have led a largely private life along with their three children. Lady Fellowes also attended the wedding of her nephew Prince William to Catherine Elizabeth Middleton on 29 April 2011.

Union-Philanthropic Society

The Union-Philanthropic (Literary) Society (UPLS) is a college literary society at Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia. 
For over two centuries, the Union-Philanthropic Society has offered Hampden-Sydney a unique forum for discussion. Whether debating the ethics of slavery — in 1810 — or discussing the various views of the historical Jesus — in 1996 — the Society has continually provided the College with an unparalleled source for the oratorical and literary improvement of her sons. 
Rather than narrowly focus on a single subject, the Society has long complemented the College's liberal curriculum by addressing topics from a variety of issues. Each week, the Society analyzes a different item from literature, politics, or the arts. The Society's exercises quickly train its members to think clearly, argue coherently, and speak forcefully on any topic. 
The oldest student organization at the College and the second-oldest literary society in America (the oldest being the American Whig-Cliosophic Society at Princeton University, it is, in fact, the oldest continuously-existing such society in America. It dates from 1789. Edward Henry, the son of Virginia's greatest orator, and William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States, were among its early members. Yet the society has never been simply a student organization, and its influence has never stopped at the College gates. Men from all backgrounds, from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to Robert E. Lee, have been awarded — and have accepted — honorary membership. 
The Union-Philanthropic Society faces the future confident in its traditions but cognizant of the need for innovation. While reinforcing its ancient emphasis on private discussion among its members, the Union-Philanthropic is now exploring new arenas for public discussion, including debates, round-table talks between faculty and students, activities with the women's colleges in the region, and hosting guest lecturers. 
Membership in the Society is an honor which is bestowed upon students who demonstrate an interest in public discussion, a thirst for learning, a friendly manner, and good character. The Society summons several men to become members each term.
Regalia.
The regalia of the Union-Philanthropic Society combines the historic regalia of the Union Society and the Philanthropic Society, which merged into one organization in September 1929.

John Van Lear McMahon

John Van Lear McMahon, lawyer, was born in Maryland in 1800, received his education equipment at Princeton, studied law and achieved eminence at the Maryland Bar. On account of his oratorical gifts, he wielded an influence of wide extent on the politics as a state legislature. He adapted the old turnpike laws of Maryland to the new condition of affairs caused by the incorporation of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and was for some years its counsel. He is said to have contributed more than any other to the prosperity of the Jackson party in Maryland, but subsequently deserted it on the United States bank question. He took a conspicuous part in the canvass of 1840, and presided at a great ratification meeting, where Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and William C. Preston made speeches. The failure of his eyesight compelled him to relinquish his profession about 1855, and much of his later life was spent in Ohio. St. John's college, Annapolis, gave him the degree of LL. D. in 1869. He published " An Historical View of Maryland," which is a standard authority on the early history of the province (Baltimore, 1831). He published 'An Historical View of Maryland', a work of very great value dealing with the early colonial days. He died in Cumberland, Md. on June 15, 1871.

Tangail Airdrop

The Tangail Airdrop was an airborne operation mounted on 11 December 1971 by the 2nd Parachute Battalion Group of the Indian Army during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The main objective of the operation was the capture of Poongli Bridge on the Jamuna which would cut off the 93 Brigade of Pakistani Army which was retreating from the north to defend Dacca and its approaches. The Paratroop unit was also tasked to link up with the advancing Maratha Light Infantry on the ground to advance towards the East Pakistani capital.
Objectives.
The Paratroopers, numbering 700 and led by Lt Col Kulwant Singh Pannu was reinforced by an Artillery battery, an Engineering detachment, an ADS, and a surgical team and other administrative troops from 50th (Indep) Parachute Brigade. Tasked to cut off the retreat of the Pakistani troops from the north towards Dacca, the unit touched ground at 4:30pm and were greeted by a jubilant crowd of local Bengali populace, with some even helping the troops carry their packs and ammunition. The drop was dispersed over a wide area, but the Paras regrouped quickly and commenced their attack. By 7.00pm they had captured their main objective, cutting off the Pakistani 93 Brigade retreating from the north. Link-up with 1 Maratha LI was established after the Marathas broke through at Tangail Road and reached the bridgehead that very evening. The Pakistanis, attempting to retake the bridge rushed the Indian positions that evening, however, were repulsed.
The Tangail Airdrop operation involved An-12, C-119s, 2 Caribous and Dakotas from 11 sqn and 48 Sqn. The IAF also carried out feint drops using dummies dropped from Caribou aircraft to hide the true location and extent of the operation. The only hitch was a Hangup from the lead Dakota. One Paratrooper had a static line hangup, who, after carrying out emergency procedures, was dropped safely about 50 miles away.
Aftermath.
The Tangail Airdrop and the subsequent capture of the Poongli bridge over Jamuna by 2nd Para Bn Gp gave the advancing Indian Army the maneouverability to side step the strongly held Tongi-Dacca Road to take the undefended Manikganj-Dacca Road right up to Mirpur Bridge at the gates of Dacca.

Finn Døssing

Finn Døssing Jensen (born 27 April 1941 in Viborg, Jutland) is a former Danish football player most famous for his spell in Scotland at Dundee United in the 1960s. He is one of the greatest goalscorers ever at the club, where he remains hugely popular.
Biography.
Døssing started his career with his hometown club Viborg FF in 1958, aged 17. He played a number of Danish national youth team matches, and made his debut for the Denmark under-21 national football team in September 1963. He never played a senior national team match, standing in the shadow of striker Ole Madsen. With the help of Jack Johnson, a former manager of B 1913, Døssing got in contact with Dundee United. He played a trial match for the club, scoring all four goals in a 4–0 win for Dundee Unied. In December 1964, he signed his first professional contract, and moved to Dundee United under manager Jerry Kerr. This effectively banned him from the strictly amateur Danish national team.
United had made a poor start to the 1964–65 First Division season and appeared to be heading towards relegation, which would have undone the great work done by Kerr since leading the team to promotion in the 1959–60 season. Since then the club had enjoyed their longest ever spell in the top flight and were becoming established as a permanent fixture in the First Division although relegation in the Spring of 1965 may have doomed the club to obscurity. However, Kerr had taken a gamble in bringing some of the first foreigners to play in Scotland. The signing of Finn Døssing turned out to be an inspired move by Kerr, with Døssing scoring 21 goals in only 19 matches and playing a huge role in the club moving into mid-table security that year. The following year, in the 1965–66 season, Døssing scored 25 goals, helping United to finished in 5th place in the league qualifying for Europe for the first time. Sadly, he did not adequately reap the reward of his efforts, as injury kept him out of both victories against FC Barcelona and the first game against Juventus, although in the home leg against the Italian giants, he returned to his usual form by scoring the game’s only goal.
After three years he left Tannadice Park a hero, having scored 76 goals in 115 appearances for and helping "the Terrors" have their first taste of European football. Returning to Denmark, he chose to play for Aalborg BK (AaB). According to the Danish rules of amateurism, Døssing was dictated a half year quarantine before he was eligible to play in the Danish championship. He entered an AaB team which had not won in their first eight matches, and helped the club finish in mid-table. Expectations were high before the 1969 season, but days before the opening of the season, Døssing decided to leave AaB. He moved back to birthtown Viborg to run his own gents’ outfitters business, a decision he never regretted. 
He retains association with Dundee United by his membership of the ArabTRUST (the club's supporters trust) and with one of the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, in Argyll, being named after him. After almost 41 years since last playing for United, he remains the idol of some of the club's fans, many of whom still consider him their favourite player.

Man and Power

Man and Power: the Story of Power from the Pyramids to the Atomic Age is a science book for children by L. Sprague de Camp, illustrated with documents and photographs, and with paintings by Alton S. Tobey, first published in hardcover by Golden Press in 1961.
As stated on the cover, the work is a survey of "the story of power from the pyramids to the atomic age." It traces the "progression of man's discovery and utilization of power ... in chapters dealing consecutively with the different sources of power--animal, wind, water, steam, internal combustion, chemical, electrical, and nuclear power, and possible future sources."
Reception.
Thomas Goonan, writing for "Library Journal", rated the book "praising its "[excellent illustrations" that "elucidate the text" and "index. Comparing it to Edward Stoddard's "The Story of Power", he judged de Camp's work "[more comprehensive and 
detailed."
"The Booklist" considered the subject "effectively presented in well-written text and a multitude of supplementary materials, all captioned and most of them in color. Its review repeated Goonan's judgment of the work as "more comprehensive" than Stoddard's. In appraising the work for older children, "The Booklist" noted it was "uvenile in approach but may be useful in high schools, particularly for its illustrations.
Isaac Asimov, writing for "The Horn Book Magazine", called it "an exciting book written with great authority and illustrated lavishly," noting that "young people interested in mechanics and machinery this book is a complete feast." He finds that "[the human mind is the hero throughout," with "personalities of scientists interest[ing Mr. de Camp only as they affect the scientists as conveyors of new thoughts."
Claire Huchet Bishop in "The Commonweal" praised the book's "xcellent approach which makes less of the machines than it does of the minds that created them."
Henry W. Hubbard in "The New York Times" wrote that "Mr. de Camp has filled his book with accurate information and absorbing history," but noted that while "writing is usually good, ... the first chapter, on manpower, suffers from jarring transitions, and the detailed explanations of steam engines and such are occasionally hard to follow." He finds the illustrations "colorful and skillfully chosen. They are, in fact, the high point of the book." Summing up, he states that "[by virtue of its thoroughness, and its informative illustrations, "Man and Power" should be especially useful in libraries and schools."

David Pelham James, MBE, DSC (25 December 1919 – 15 December 1986) was a British Conservative Party politician, author and adventurer.
Biography.
Early life and education.
He was the eldest son of Sir Archibald James and Bridget James Miller (née Guthrie). He went first to Summer Fields School in Oxford and then Eton. After leaving there, in 1937, he sailed round the world "before the mast" in the 4-masted barque "Viking", based out of the Finnish port of Mariehamn.
In 1938 he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, to read Geography, but left after four terms to join the RNVR.
Wartime service.
James served as a Lieutenant in command of Motor Gun Boats operating out of Felixstowe. In the early hours of Sunday 28 February 1943, his then vessel "MGB 79", was sunk in action off the Hook of Holland. James and three of his crew were rescued from the water by a German trawler and were taken prisoner. He was sent to "Marlag "O"", the naval prisoner-of-war camp near Westertimke.
He attempted to escape in December 1943, slipping out of the shower block on a foggy morning, then crossed Germany wearing his full British naval uniform, but with forged papers identifying him as "I. Bagerov" of the Bulgarian Navy. James made it as far as the port of Lübeck and had made contact with the crew of a Swedish ship willing to smuggle him out of the country before he was arrested, and returned to the camp. His second escape in late 1944 was covered by "Albert R.N.", a life-sized dummy, that ensured that he would not be missed in the head-count. James again headed for the coast, posing as a merchant seaman, and this time made it to Sweden.
A self-penned account of his 11 months in (and out of) the camp was published in the UK as "Prisoner's Progress" (William Blackwood 1947) and in the US under the title "Escaper's Progress" (W. W. Norton 1955). A review at the time described the work as "one of the better escape books". In 1978, when the book was re-published in the UK in paperback as "Escaper's Progress" (Corgi), his original account of the escape, as prepared for Naval Intelligence was included as an appendix, having become de-classified. This has again been republished by Pen & Sword Ltd.
In 1944 James joined Operation Tabarin, wintering in Graham Land in 1945. In consequence, the James Nunatak was named after him by the British Antarctic Survey.
Post-war career.
James was then chosen to act as Polar Advisor to director Charles Frend for the 1948 film production of "Scott of the Antarctic", during which he appeared as John Mills' "body double" in a number of long shots in the snow. Never one to miss a book opportunity, James wrote "Scott of the Antarctic: The Film and Its Production" which was published by Lon Convoy, followed a year later, in 1949, by "That Frozen Land - The story of a year in the Antarctic".
James was asked by George G. Harrap and Co. to co-edit, with J. Lennox Kerr, a book of wartime stories and experiences of RNVR members entitled "Wavy Navy - By Some Who Served." (1950), and was then chosen by the daughter of Lord Roberts of Kandahar to write her father's biography, published by Hollis & Carter under the title "Lord Roberts" (1954).
In 1957 James wrote a book entitled "Outward Bound", with a foreword by the Duke of Edinburgh, about the organisation of the same name and in 1960 co-edited, with The Field editor Wilson Stephens, "In Praise of Fox Hunting", a series of essays by contributors such as Dick Francis, Jimmy Edwards and BBC show jumping commentator Dorian Williams.
In 1962, weeks before the birth of his youngest son, he featured on "This Is Your Life", having been ambushed at Victoria Station by Eamonn Andrews and his red book, getting off the train from his home town of Haywards Heath.
Although born into a Church of England family, he was a director of Catholic publishing house Burns & Oates, having been received into the church whilst a POW.
Member of parliament.
He was Member of Parliament for Brighton Kemptown from 1959 to 1964, when he lost, after a record seven recounts, by just 7 votes to Labour's Dennis Hobden (the first Labour MP for a Sussex constituency). James was subsequently elected as MP for North Dorset in 1970 and he served as member for that seat until his retirement in 1979, when he was succeeded by Sir Nicholas Baker.
Always a firm believer in the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, he co-founded the "Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau" with naturalist Sir Peter Scott in 1962. In the 1964 election when he lost his Brighton seat, the narrowness of the result led to speculation that his stance on this 'issue' had been used against him by his political opponents, and may have proved decisive. His own view was that his campaign was sabotaged by extreme left wing infiltrators, in revenge for the assistance he had given to the exposure of ballot rigging in the Electrical Trades Union.
Personal life.
On 20 May 1950, he married Jaquetta Mary Theresa (née Digby) (born 28 October 1928), youngest daughter of Edward Kenelm Digby, 11th Baron Digby and sister of Pamela Churchill Harriman. They had six children, four sons and two daughters, born between 1951 and 1962. In 1979 he changed his name to David Guthrie-James to mark the connection between Clan Guthrie and his family home Torosay Castle on the Isle of Mull.
His friend John Robson wrote his biography which was published under the title "One Man In His Time" (Spellmount Ltd. 1998).

Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie

The "Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie (Cologne Journal for Sociology and Social Psychology)" is a German academic journal for sociology. It has an empirical focus on social research, both qualitatively and quantitatively, often in the tradition of Max Weber's ""Verstehende Soziologie"" (Interpretive Sociology). Articles are usually published in German with an abstract in English.
History.
The journal's roots go back to the "Kölner Vierteljahreshefte für Sozialwissenschaften (Cologne Quarterly of Social Sciences)", founded in 1921 by the German sociologist Leopold von Wiese. After World War II it was again von Wiese who refounded the journal as ”Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie” in 1948. Under his successor René König, the quarterly soon expanded to social psychological subjects, which was reflected by the once again changed name.

BM-14

The BM-14 (BM for "Boyevaya Mashina", 'combat vehicle'), is a Soviet-made 140mm multiple rocket launcher, fielded by the Soviet Union.
The BM-14 can fire rockets fitted with chemical (MS-14), smoke (M-14D) or high-explosive fragmentation (M-14-OF) warheads. It is similar to the BM-13 "Katyusha" and was partly replaced in service by the 122 mm BM-21 Grad.
The rocket has a range of about 9.8 km and can carry a warhead of 8 kg weight. Launchers were built in 16 and 17-round variants.
The weapon is not accurate as there is no guidance system, but it is extremely effective in saturation bombardment.
Algerian armed forces used BM-14 rocket launchers in 1993 during the Algerian Civil War.
The BM-14 was believed to have been the delivery method for the Ghouta chemical attacks in August 2013, during the Syrian Civil War The BM-14 is used by the Syrian government and large numbers have been captured by the rebels.

<doc id="5976463" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5976463" title="Pararealgar">
Pararealgar

Pararealgar is an arsenic sulfide mineral with the chemical formula As4S4 also represented as AsS. It forms gradually from realgar under exposure to light. Its name derives from the fact that its elemental composition is identical to realgar, As4S4. It is soft with a Mohs hardness of 1 - 1.5, is yellow orange in colour, and its monoclinic prismatic crystals are very brittle, easily crumbling to powder.
It is one of the sulfides of arsenic and is one of two isomers of As4S4. It forms upon exposure of the symmetrical isomer to light. Its name derives from the fact that its elemental composition is identical to realgar, As4S4.
Structure.
Both isomers of As4S4 are molecular, in contrast to the other main sulfide of arsenic, orpiment (As2S3), which is polymeric. In pararealgar, there are three kinds of As centres (and three kinds of S centres). The molecule has Cs symmetry. In realgar, the four As (and four S) centres are equivalent and the molecule has D2d symmetry. An analogous pair of isomers is also recognized for the corresponding phosphorus sulfides P4S4.
Occurrence.
Pararealgar occurs as an alteration product of realgar in stibnite-bearing quartz veins typically as a result of exposure to light. It occurs associated with realgar, stibnite, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite, duranusite, native arsenic, arsenolite, native sulfur, lepidocrocite and pyrite.
It was first described in 1980 for an occurrence in the Grey Rock Mine, Truax Creek, Bridge River area, Lillooet Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada. It has since been reported from a variety of locations worldwide.

Camp Ramah in Wisconsin

Camp Ramah in Wisconsin is a Jewish summer camp based in Conover, Wisconsin, on Upper Lake Buckatabon. The Wisconsin camp was the first of the Ramah camps, established in 1947 by Rabbi Ralph Simon, under the direction of Conservative educator Henry Goldberg, with nearly 100 campers. It was sponsored by the Chicago Council of Conservative Synagogues and the Midwest Branch of the United Synagogue.
It draws campers from across the Midwest, primarily Chicago and the Twin Cities. The camp also hosts the Chicago region United Synagogue Youth (USY) encampment (a.k.a. "Camp Chusy"). Campers stay at the camp for either four or eight weeks, depending on their age division, or ""edah"". Following Nivonim, the edah for those entering 11th grade, campers are encouraged to participate in Ramah Israel Seminar. The summer following Seminar, they may apply to join the camp staff. The Camp Ramah Director is Jacob Cytryn. The Executive Director of Ramah Wisconsin and the Ramah Day Camp of Chicago is Rabbi David Soloff.
History.
The first Ramah camp was built on a site purchased by the Jewish Theological Seminary on Larsen's Bay. The property was a fishing village on the shores of Upper Lake Buckatabon owned by the Larsen family, dotted with small cabins (a few of which still remain as part of the Nivonim boys cabins) and wild flowers. Multi-purpose buildings were quickly erected, and the first campers arrived by train on the Flambau Express line. According to Shom Sefor Klaff's interview for the 50th reunion (Klaff was a camper in 1947), a seaplane brought the weekly movie to the camp. Klaff added that campers had a dress code to follow, especially for shabbat. 
Irving Robbin, a former prisoner of war of the Nazis, was President of the camp for 19 years. In 1962, 260 boys and girls were campers during the summer.
In July 2008, busloads of campers from the camp took part in a rally in support of immigrant workers at the nation's largest kosher meat plant.
Tikvah programs.
Tikvah.
The Tikvah program was established at Ramah Wisconsin in 1973, and it aims to offer the Ramah experience to teens with special needs. The Tikvah program is designed for campers with learning and social difficulties, including Asperger syndrome. The program at Ramah Wisconsin includes a special "Mo'adon", or lounge building, with a kitchen and dedicated resources for the program.
Atzmayim (Vocational program).
"Atzmayim", meaning independent ones, is the name for the Tikvah vocational program. This is an eight-week program established shortly after 2002 focused on former Tikvah campers who are post-high school age. Participants work in the nearby town of Eagle River five mornings a week. Job locations include coffee shops, plant and garden supply stores, supermarkets and hotels. Participants return in the afternoon for a Judaica class and activities. Participants have their own lounge and kitchen, and live in dedicated staff housing. Participants have one day off a week, and do not work on Shabbat.
Jewish values.
Tefilot.
Campers lead their own services three times a day, with each age division assigned its own Makom Tefilah (place of prayer). Camper responsibility for the services increases as campers age, with the oldest edot not only leading, but reading torah and haftorah, and even providing divrei Torah. Campers who do not have these liturgical skills sometimes spend their free time at camp learning how to lead services. Friday nights feature an all-camp service on the waterfront.
Shabbat.
Ramah in Wisconsin is a Shabbat-observant camp. Many campers and staff members are not Sabbath observant at home, so Ramah in Wisconsin may be their first exposure to being "Shomer Shabbat." Campers and staff are not prohibited from using personal electronic devices in the cabin, but all are asked not to use such devices in public during Shabbat. Raw food is not cooked in the kitchen on Shabbat, but pre-cooked food is warmed in a manner that is permitted by Jewish law.
Shabbat is brought in all-camp Friday night services, which features campers dressing up for the evening, taking pictures in groups, and having time to sit and talk with friends and siblings. The service often features the melodies of Orthodox Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. A special Shabbat dinner follows. Campers get to wake up later on Saturday mornings than they do on weekdays. After Shacharit and Musaf services which start the day, they have free time, which is often spent on the sports fields. After lunch, campers participate in Shabbat discussions, which are usually efforts to connect the weekly parsha with modern Jewish life. Shabbat concludes with Seudah Shlishit, evening activities and Havdalah.
Kashrut.
Ramah in Wisconsin is a Kashrut-observant camp. Many campers and staff members are not Kashrut observant at home, so Ramah in Wisconsin may be their first exposure to keeping kosher. Camper orientation involves learning about the meat and dairy sides of the kitchen. Meals are served as either dairy or meat meals (even when the meal is parve, and full-time mashgichim (kashrut supervisors) are present in the kitchen throughout the day. 
Only strictly kosher products are allowed in the camp, so food is not allowed in from outside. Campers are thus able to see that keeping kashrut can be part of a regular life.
Education.
The educational goals of the Ramah camps are to make Jewish learning a part of the everyday camp experience, using a combination of formal and informal educational tools. Campers are theoretically required to participate in six hours of Jewish studies a week during the school year. This requirement is often waived, as most Conservative synagogues do not offer the requisite number of hours. While not actually shown in the camp brochure, or talked about by campers in the promotional video, campers have two mandatory classes every day (except Shabbat and Wednesdays), taught by a combination of Israeli and American staff. This formal education takes up two of the seven programming periods of the day.
Hebrew classes.
Hebrew classes are mandatory for campers, excluding Machon and Nivonim, who have electives, and for those who participate in the Beit Midrash Program. They are arranged by level within each age division. Campers are tested at the start of the year. Classes are taught exclusively by members of the Mishlachat, Israelis who participate in an emissaries program run by the Jewish Agency. The teachers are usually young women who have recently completed their army/national service. They are not usually members of the Masorti movement, Israel’s Conservative Jewish community.
Jewish studies classes.
Jewish study classes are mandatory for all campers excluding Machon and Nivonim, who have electives, and for those younger campers who do not participate in the Beit Midrash Program. These classes are not arranged by level, and often based on a theme or concept (Shabbat, Tzedakah), rather than a text. They are often taught by rabbinical school students, or occasionally by Jewish day school teachers.
Beit Midrash.
The Beit Midrash program offers campers in Bogrim and Machon a double period of study in place of Hebrew and Text, and offers Shoafim campers one period of study instead of their regular Jewish studies class. It is taught by Orthodox and some Conservative educators whose background is in Talmud and other Rabbinic texts. The Beit Midrash also includes a program called "the Northwoods Kollel", which unlike the traditional Orthodox model, is co-educational, and composed of between four and six college-age students who have usually not participated in the Ramah camping movement. Participants spend the day immersed in Talmud study. Classes focus on skill-building by reading a specific Rabbinic text, usually a perek of the Babylonian Talmud.
Hebrew outside the classroom.
Ramah is known as a Hebrew-speaking camp, which it was at its inception. Hebrew exams before camp were once required to gain enrollment. Near total immersion was once one of the effective techniques used by Ramah Wisconsin, with Hebrew being required to get food in the dining room, supplies in art and so on. After the 1970s, serious efforts in using Hebrew outside the classroom became limited. Currently, Hebrew is still publicly used in announcements in the dining room and campwide events, musicals, and the refereeing of softball games. Although it is unclear if campers comprehend the Hebrew used in those contexts, campers rapidly learn the Hebrew needed in order to get snack at the canteen, or "chanutiya." Some buildings are referred to by Hebrew names, but most camp activities and locations are referred to in a camp slang that is a mix of Hebrew and English, for example, “Meltzing” for waiting tables (from the Hebrew מלצר for "waiter"). Edot names are still in Hebrew.
Library.
The Blanche Lippitz Library at the camp was established by the Sisterhoods of Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan a tribute to the services rendered by Lippitz.
Activities.
"Tarbut".
Camp Ramah In Wisconsin offers a number of activities for the campers. The main ""Tarbut"" (Hebrew for "culture") activities include:
Sports.
Each day, excluding Wednesdays and Saturdays, has sport periods for campers. They can choose from basketball, aerobics, softball, tennis, kayaking, and sailing. In recent years, lacrosse, ultimate frisbee and field hockey have been offered. Martial arts or self-defense are occasionally offered. In addition, the camp has a beach volleyball area, and while ga-ga is not offered as an activity choice, it is played regularly. Sports programs are recreational and competitive in nature, and do not focus on kinesthetic skill development. The most popular two sports are basketball and softball, because of the inter-edah (age division) games in these two sports.
Swimming.
Every age division has a perek (time period) devoted swim class once a day. At the beginning of the summer, campers are tested and placed into an American Red Cross swimming class based on their skill level. Campers in the Machon age division are offered a chance to enroll in a lifeguarding course that offers American Red Cross certification for those who successfully complete the course.
Facilities.
Ohel Yitzchak.
While all other prayer areas are part of multi-purpose rooms, each edah spends time praying in Ohel Yitzchak, the only permanent synagogue on the campus. Named in memory of Rabbi Isaac Bonder, the synagogue has large windows that look out into the forest, and tent-like architecture. The parochet, or ark curtain, was created by Annabelle Argand, features a tree that has just begun to bloom, reflecting the life cut short of Rabbi Bonder. The path leading to the synagogue is also incomplete. The ner tamid is a crown that is actually a ring of people holding hands and created by Israeli artist Gedaliah ben Tzvi, and the Sheviti is a paper cut by Roger Coleson, a former camp teacher who also died at an early age.
Chadar Ochel.
Ramah Wisconsin’s three dining rooms serve over 2,100 meals a day when camp is in full swing. The dining rooms are also used for various activities and events. A new facility with a renovated kitchen and three brand-new dining halls opened in June 2009.
Annual events.
Zimriah (Song Festival).
Early in the summer the Zimriah (song festival) takes place. Every edah learns a song that follows a theme for the summer, with the majority of the songs coming from Israeli songwriters. Every edah wears a color for that evening, giving the appearance of a color war. (While the oldest age division wears black, pre-2000 Zimriot saw the Nivonim wearing tie-dye shirts, plaid, or even white.) After all edot have sung their songs, each edah stands up again and sings their own edah song. Traditionally, the older edot join in with the songs for the younger edot. After all songs have been sung, the entire camp stands up and sings the Himnon Ramah, the camp song, which is traditionally sung after all camp-wide gatherings.
Rikudiah (Dance Festival).
Now held near the end of the summer, the Rikudiah was originally held on the tennis courts as a part of the visitors' weekend festivities. While the Rikudiah is open to all campers, only the youngest edot dance as a whole edah. Older edot are usually represented by those who take dance as a tarbut (cultural) activity, a group that is predominantly female. In addition, the Mishlachat (Israeli staff), the educational staff, the European staff and the administrative staff each perform a dance. When all the presentations are complete, the whole camp dances together, with each edah called to bed until only Nivonim and staff remain. 
The focus of the Rikudiah originally emphasized Israeli folk dance and dances to classic songs from Israel and Jewish traditional life. These aspects are no longer a part of the Wisconsin Rikudiah. The most predominant style of dance seen is a variation on urban/hip-hop dance, with the occasional modern or jazz dance piece.
Tisha B'Av.
The fast day of Tisha B'Av is the only Jewish holiday that falls during the summer. Camp begins commemoration of the day with ma’ariv in the dining halls after a seudah mafseket (a meal to prepare for a fast). Nivonimers form paths of paper lanterns from dining hall to bet am, and the entire camp walks through the candle-lit paths to a communal reading of Aicah (the Book of Lamentations). Following the reading, campers fast and participate in discussions, role-playing simulations and other special activities until the breaking of the fast the following night (pre-bnai-mitzvah campers do not normally fast).
Yom Sport.
Every year there is a Yom Sport, or "Sport Day". This day is similar to the traditional "color wars" found at other summer camps around the world. Campers are divided into four teams, traditionally having Red, White, Blue, and some other color. Campers from Nivonim are team captains, two for each team. Other Nivonim campers are part of the black team, or "Team Uber," or vice-administrators. Each team within each edah compete with the other teams in the edah throughout the event. 
Throughout the day, campers are required to cheer in Hebrew, and often take up Israeli sports teams (Beitar, Hapoel, etc.) The day currently ends with a giant, camp-wide relay race called "The Apache," adaptation of the Jicarilla Apache religious ritual brought to Ramah Wisconsin from "Indian" camps (ostensibly teaching some form of Native American values). This adaptation of Native American practices, one of the few at Ramah lacking either a Hebrew name or a Jewish cultural reference, replaced the original end of day event, the camp wide tug-of-war. The events that make up the Apache change every year. Elements include both the whimsical, such as of a mummy wrap, tent building, and car washing, as well as physically more demanding events such as long distance swimming and running. The conclusion of the Apache is a fire building contest, where the victors are the first to snap a string suspended above their fire pit.
No smoking.
No Smoking is the close-of-summer program that combines award ceremonies, encores of musical numbers from edah musicals, and a multi-sectioned slide show on the last night of camp. No Smoking was originally a joke-filled roast of camp figures created in the late 1950s. Campers were responsible for their own program, and the musical interlude was a nonsensical jingle based on the doo-wop hit "Sha-boom," inspired by the songs in the dining room. As the camp grew and campers became more sensitive, the jokes and roasting elements were banned.
Musicals.
Each edah from Sollelim through Nivonim puts on a Broadway musical entirely in Hebrew. Certain plays are relegated to different edot, such as "The Little Mermaid" and "Peter Pan" given to younger edot such as Sollelim and Shoafim, because of their simplicity. More complex plays like "Mamma Mia", "Les Miserables" and "Hairspray" are usually reserved for Bogrim, Machon, and Nivonim because of complex and more mature subject matter.
Jonathan Adam Ross, Jewish theatre artist, who has performed his first solo show, “Walking in Memphis: The Life of a Southern Jew,” Off-Broadway is also a founding company member of the Northwoods Ramah Theatre and Storahtelling, and traces his acting roots to his longtime association with Camp Ramah in Wisconsin, where he serves as director of the performing arts.

Lord Ahriman

Lord Ahriman is a Swedish musician and composer best known as the primary guitarist and songwriter of black metal band Dark Funeral. He is the only founding member remaining in the band, he is also rhythm guitarist in Wolfen Society. His name is derived from "Ahriman" (), the evil equivalent of the deity Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.
Biography.
Originally from Luleå a small town in the north of Sweden, Ahriman developed an interest in music from a very young age. Hailing from a somewhat musical family, he cited his grandmother, mother and younger sister as influences and he started songwriting himself between 1989 and 1990.
Harbouring interests for Satanism (ostensibly that of the LaVeyan variant) and extreme metal as a teenager, he was introverted in his environment. When he was eighteen years old, he left for Stockholm, home to extreme metal acts such as Entombed and Dismember, whom Ahriman already knew personally.
He has also been an active participant in death metal. Before he played in Dark Funeral he played in a blackened death metal band called Satan's Disciples, and he has a side-project called Wolfen Society, who released an MCD "Conquer Divine" in 2001, although difficulties with No Fashion Records hindered its success.
Ahriman and other Dark Funeral members were forced to have side-jobs after No Fashion did not grant them royalties for their work on Dark Funeral's backcatalogue. Consequently Dark Funeral filed suit against No Fashion, and have since spearheaded a campaign against "corrupt" record labels. In October 2008, it was announced that Ahriman and Emperor Magus Caligula succeeded in obtaining the rights to Dark Funeral's entire backcatalogue.
In 2013 Lord Ahriman & Dark Funeral signed to Century Media Records for their upcoming new studio album.

Kodanad

Kodanad is a rural riverside village of Ernakulam district, Kerala, southern India. Kodanad is situated on the south bank of Periyar river, about 42 kilometers east of Kochi. The nearest air port is Cochin International Airport which is about 20 km (12 mi) by road. The village is a major tourist destination because it houses an Elephant training center.
History.
In 1950-60s, Kodanad used to be the largest of several elephant training centres for captured Elephants from the adjoining forest regions. They were trained using Mahouts, specially skilled people also known as 'Paappaan' in Malayalam language. In 1970s, there was a ban to elephant capture by Government of India and from then on, Kodanad is primarily used as a rescue training centre.
Kaprikkad ecotourism project.
Kodanad is in the list of Ecotourism destination projects sponsored by the Government of India. As a part of this project, Kaprikkad, a village lying 3 km adjacent to Kodanad on the river bank has been set up in 2006 for entertaining visitors in the most natural and environmental friendly way.

Early life and studies.
Colin Barry Phipps was born in Britain on 23 July 1934 at Swansea. He attended Townfield Elementary School in Hayes, Middlesex, then Acton County Grammar School, and the Bishop Gore School, Swansea. From University College London he gained a BSc in Geology in 1955; and a PhD in Geology from the University of Birmingham in 1957.
Career.
Parliament.
He stood in the Walthamstow East by-election in March 1969, and lost decisively.
He served as Member of Parliament for Dudley West from February 1974 to 1979, when he stood down. His successes in the oil industry made him one of the more wealthy Labour MPs. He joined the Social Democratic Party in the 1980s, and unsuccessfully stood for election in 
Worcester at the 1983 general election, and Stafford in 1987.
Geology.
From 1957 to 1964 Phipps worked with Shell in Venezuela, the Netherlands and the USA.

David Civera

David Civera Gracia (born in Teruel, Aragón, Spain on 8 January 1979) is a Spanish singer.
Biography.
David Civera was born in Teruel, in 1979. His parents are José and Pilar and he has two sisters, Sonia is older than David, and Andrea is the youngest. David studied Computer Studies and Communications but he liked music better and wanted to sing. His father traveled with him twice a month from Teruel to Valencia where David received solfa, guitar and piano classes.
He won a national 'Karaoke' TV show and participated in other TV programs ("El sur de Jerez", "Las estrellas del parque" etc.). Then, in 1996, he participated in the TV show "Lluvia de estrellas", where participants impersonated a fashionable artist. He impersonated Enrique Iglesias with the song "Experiencia religiosa". He failed to win this program. However he was told he had his own style. Shortly afterwards, he made his only appearance on Antena 3's "La parodia nacional" where, assigned the artist name of "Lolo Pocholo," he once again impersonated Iglesias singing the parodied "Enriquito y su papá."
In 1997, he took part in a new TV show "Canciones de nuestra vida", where participants covered old songs, and at the same time he released his first CD "Hoy como ayer". However this CD failed to gain commercial success.
Later, he took part in other TV shows too. Eventually this led him to meet producer Alejandro Abad, who suggested him to participate in "Eurocanción", the TV show used to choose the Spanish representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2001. He accepted and on 23 February 2001, he was chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Dile que la quiero" (Tell Her That I Love Her).
At the Eurovision final that took place in Copenhagen, Denmark on 12 May 2001, he finished in 6th position, which has not been surpassed by consequent Spanish representatives yet.
Later career.
He released a new album titled "Dile que la quiero", which achieved a great success. A year later, in 2002, he released the album "En cuerpo y alma" that sold more than 200,000 copies, and its first single "Qué la detengan" eventually became a summer hit. In 2003, he went to New Orleans to record a new album, "La Chiqui Big Band". This album included two new hits, "Bye Bye" and "Rosa y espinas". The latter was a duet with David Bisbal.
2004 was a relatively quiet year for Civera, but he released a concert DVD among other things.
In 2005, he released "Perdóname", a tango-inspired album. The same year, Civera participated in "¡Mira quién baila!" (Spanish version of "Dancing with the Stars"). Civera won this program and he donated the monetary prize to patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
In 2006 he released the album "Ni el primero ni el último", which contained mostly ballads and a few dance songs. The first single was "El orgullo y la Visa".
In 2007 he published the album "No bastará", where there was an evolution to pop. Finally, in 2009 he released "Podemos elegir".
He got married in 2007 with his girlfriend Ana María Benedi. They had been together since they were teenagers. In 2011 they had their first son, Daniel.

The Day of the Dinosaur

The Day of the Dinosaur is a science book by L. Sprague de Camp and Catherine Crook de Camp, illustrated with plates. It was first published in hardcover by Doubleday in 1968, and in paperback by Curtis Books in 1970 or 1971. A second hardcover edition was issued by Bonanza Books in 1985. The first chapter was reprinted as "One Day in the Cretaceous" in the de Camps's collection "Footprints on Sand" (, 1981).
As stated on the dust cover of the Doubleday edition, the work is a survey of "the exciting story of the lost world of the great reptiles and of the fossil hunters who discovered them millions of years later." It argues, among other things, that the theory of evolution took hold after Darwin because of interest spurred by recently popularized dinosaur remains, corresponding to legends of dragons.

Johann Friedrich Unger

Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Unger (1753, Berlin - December 26, 1804, Berlin) was a German printer and publisher.
He was the fifth son of the printer Johann Georg Unger (October 26, 1715, Goes bei Pirna - August 15, 1788, Berlin) and his wife Susanna Katharine (maiden name: Strucken). He took on an apprenticeship at the print shop of the Oberhof printer Georg Jacob Decker. In 1779 Unger requested a print shop for himself and in January 1780 he was granted one. Later, he expanded it to a publishing bookseller, in which he published works by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Friedrich Schleiermacher as well as August and Friedrich Schlegel.
From 1784 onward he attempted repeatedly to gain approval to publish what would have been Berlin’s first daily newspaper. His attempts were rejected as the two existing newspapers in Berlin were found to be sufficient and another newspaper would overload the censors. In 1802 Unger nonetheless became co-owner of the "Vossische Zeitung".
In 1793, he invented the ""Unger-Fraktur"", a type of Fraktur.

Dover Street

Dover Street is a street in Mayfair, London, England. The street is notable for its Georgian architecture as well as the location of historic London clubs and hotels, which have been frequented by world leaders and historic figures in the arts. It also hosts a number of contemporary art galleries. An equestrian sculpture by Elisabeth Frink stands on the junction of Dover Street and Piccadilly, opposite the Ritz Hotel.
History.
Dover Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by Sir Thomas Bond. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1683 and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built Bond Street and Albemarle Street.
Anne Lister (1791–1840), a notable Victorian thespian, liked to stay at Hawkins, 26 Dover Street.
In June 1797 John Nash moved into 28 Dover Street a building of his own design, he built an even bigger house next door at 29 into which he moved the following year.
Edward Moxon moved from premises he had established in 1830 in New Bond Street to 44 Dover Street. He published Wordsworth from 1835 onwards and in 1839 issued the first complete edition of Shelley's poems. In 1841, he was found guilty of blasphemy for passages in Shelley's "Queen Mab".
Brown's Hotel (then termed a "genteel inn") was established in 1837 by James Brown, Lord Byron's valet, who took a lease on 23 Dover Street to cater for those who were in town "for the Season". He ran it with his wife, Sarah Willis, the personal maid of Lady Byron, who gave financial support. The hotel was later enlarged and joined with backing premises on Albemarle Street. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made the first successful telephone call in Britain from the hotel. In 1890, The International Niagara Commission met in the hotel and their decision on distributing "Niagara power" subsequently led to the adoption of the alternating current worldwide. Other guests have included Napoleon III, Theodore Roosevelt (at the time of his marriage), Rudyard Kipling and Agatha Christie (her book "At Bertram's Hotel" is based on Brown's).
Oliver Wendell Holmes in "Our Hundred Days in Europe" records staying at Mackellar's Hotel, 17 Dover Street, where "we found ourselves comfortably lodged and well cared for during the whole time we were in London".
In the 1920s many notable photographers were based in Dover Street including Paul Tanqueray, Hugh Cecil and Alexander Bassano. Marcus Adams, Yvonne Gregory and Bertram Park, the "Three Photographers", were based at 43 Dover Street.
Green Park tube station was originally known as Dover Street station, but was renamed in 1933 after refurbishments to install escalators, when its entrance no longer opened onto Dover Street.
Clubs.
The street is historically and currently the location of a number of well-known London clubs, although the oldest and most fashionable London clubs are located in St James's and Pall Mall:
And a fictional one:
Galleries.
Art galleries in the street include:
Location.
The street lies in the south of Mayfair in the West End. To the south-east, the street adjoins the major thoroughfare of Piccadilly. To the north-west, it continues as Grafton Street. To the north-east is Albemarle Street, running parallel with Dover Street and the location of the Royal Institution. South-west is Berkeley Street (adjoining Berkeley Square to the north), also running in parallel.
The nearest tube station is Green Park.

Stanton Drew

Stanton Drew is a small village and civil parish within the Chew Valley in Somerset, England, situated north of the Mendip Hills, south of Bristol in the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority.
The village is most famous for its prehistoric Stanton Drew stone circles, the largest being the Great Circle, a henge monument consisting of the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury). The stone circle is 113 m in diameter and probably consisted of 30 stones, of which 27 survive today.
The village also has a range of listed buildings, dating from the 13th to 15th centuries, including the church of St Mary the Virgin, the Round House (Old Toll House) and various farmhouses.
The parish of Stanton Drew, which includes the hamlet of Stanton Wick has a population of 762. It includes a primary school, pub (the "Druids Arms"), church and village hall, which is the venue for a mother and toddler group and preschool as well as various village activities. The area around the village has several dairy and arable farms on neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. It is also a dormitory village for people working in Bath and Bristol.
History.
Stanton Drew was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as "Stantone", meaning 'The stone enclosure with an oak tree' from the Old English "stan" and "tun" and from the Celtic "deru".
After the Norman Conquest the Lords of the Manor took their name from the village. In the reign of Henry II Robert de Stanton was succeeded by Geoffrey de Stanton. One of the family Drogo or Drew gave his name to the place to distinguish it from Stanton Prior and Stanton Wick. It subsequently came into the possession of the Choke and then the Cooper and Coates families.
The parish of Stanton Drew was part of the Keynsham Hundred,
Coal mining.
During the 19th and 20th centuries there were two coal mines within the parish. Bromley Pit was in operation from 1860 to 1957 and Rydon's (or Riding's) from 1808 to 1833. They formed part of the northern section of the Somerset coalfield.
Governance.
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.
Along with Chelwood and Clutton, Stanton Drew is part of the Clutton Ward which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service.
Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District.
The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.
Demographics.
According to the 2001 Census, the Clutton Ward (which includes Chelwood and Clutton), had 1,290 residents, living in 483 households, with an average age of 40.3 years. Of these 72% of residents describing their health as 'good', 22% of 16–74-year olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 2.2% of all economically active people aged 16–74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 24,527 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.
Landmarks.
Rectory Farmhouse.
The Rectory Farmhouse is a Grade II* listed building, dating from the 15th century. A barn about 35 metres west of the farmhouse dates from the same period, as does a dovecote in the grounds.
The Round House.
At the northern entrance to the village before the bridge over the River Chew is a white thatched, 18th-century house which became a toll house when turnpikes were in use. It is a Grade II listed building.
The Court.
The Court in Bromley Road dates from 1753 and is a Grade II* listed building. It is now used as a nursing home. The walls and piers around this property are themselves Grade II listed.
Watermill.
There is some evidence of a watermill, used as a forge in the 1660s, a copper mill from 1713–1860 and then a paper mill.
Other Grade II listed buildings.
There are several other listed buildings in the village, the oldest being the 15th-century Church Farmhouse.
Buildings from the 17th century include Byemills Farmhouse, Codrington Cottage, Stanton Wick Farmhouse, Parson's Farmhouse, and another cottage and attached wall near the church.
Later buildings include those from the 19th century such as: Mill Place, and its accompanying wall and piers, Rosedale, and Fern Cottage.
Bridge.
The narrow limestone bridge over the River Chew is possibly 13th or 14th-century in origin with more recent repairs. The bridge spans about 12 metres, about 5 metres across footway, parapet wall to each side, about one metre high. Each side has two pointed arches with chamfered mouldings and relieving arch, central cutwater with off-sets to each side and pyramidal stone top, inner ribs to vaults; on east side, oval plaque with illegible inscription and strengthening with exposed steel girder. Ancient Monument Avon no. 162. The bridge was damaged in the Great Flood of 1968.
Religious sites.
The Church of St Mary the Virgin has been a place of Christian worship for at least eight hundred years. In the north aisle is the Norman bowl of the font and further east the small turret steps behind a glass door that in earlier times led up into a rood loft. Although parts date from the 13th and 14th centuries the interior, as it is seen today, shows the work that was carried out in the mid 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Hazle, Wight Preston and several other unidentified monuments in the churchyard are also listed, along with the piers, gates and overthrow at the north-east entrance to churchyard.
Popular culture.
Stanton Drew was commemorated by Adge Cutler in his popular song ""When the Common Market Comes to Stanton Drew"".
Written in response to opening up of trade with Europe, Adge suggests what might happen to Somerset culture when Europeans come over. In retrospect, it is more truthful than anyone could have imagined – "when George comes home from milking, ee'll get a big surprise, when 'ee sits down expecting Irish Stew, an' his wife says George i'll get 'ee, a gert dollop of spaghetti, 'cos the Common Market's come to Stanton Drew".

Peenemünde Airfield

Peenemünde Airfield is an airfield along the Baltic Sea north of Peenemünde, Germany. Today round trips in light aircraft take place from Peenemünde Airfield. Bus tours are also available, on which one can visit the former shelters of the NVA and the remnants of the V-1 flying bomb facilities. Because of its long runway the airfield Peenemünde is also a location for flight schools.
History.
On April 2, 1936, the Reich Air Ministry paid 750,000 German Reichsmarks to the town of Wolgast for the whole Northern peninsula of Usedom. The airfield began service on 1 April 1938, and on the same date, the Air Ministry officially separated Peenemünde-West from the joint command that included the adjacent Army Research Center Peenemünde.
As "Werk West", the Luftwaffe Test Site () was used for testing experimental aircraft ("Erprobungsflugzeug") such as the Heinkel He 176 (flown at Peenemünde on June 20, 1939) and the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered fighter (code named 'Peenemünde 30' by British intelligence - the '30' referring to the object's measured wingspan in feet). At the northeast edge of the concrete airfield was a launch ramp for testing the V-1 flying bomb and, on which in 1943, RAF officer Constance Babington Smith, working at RAF Medmenham, detected a small winged aircraft ('Peenemünde 20') while viewing an Allied reconnaissance photograph. The airfield was also used for take-off of Heinkel He 111 for initial air-launch testing of V-1s. V-1 launch crew training was at the nearby resort of Zempin, and after the August 1943 Operation "Hydra" bombing of the area, V-1 flight testing was moved to Brüsterort. Peenemünde West also developed World War II night-navigation and radar systems (Dr. Johannes Plendl). After the 2nd Belorussian Front under General Konstantin Rokossovsky captured the Swinemünde port and Usedom island on May 5, 1945, the airfield became part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation.
Post-war.
In 1956, the airfield received a new 2,465 metre-long concrete runway, which is oriented in a northwesterly direction and allows the operation of modern military jet planes. A further landmark is the collection of radio beacons at the northwest end, which were built on artificial islands in the sea. In 1961, the airfield was transferred to the National People's Army (NVA), which used it until 1989. After 1989, the airfield was used among other things as parking area of former military vehicles of the NVA. From Summer 2010, a high-performance jet trainer aircraft Aero L-39 Albatros of the former National People's Army (NVA) is back on Peenemünde Airfield.

The Arrows of Hercules

The Arrows of Hercules is an historical novel by L. Sprague de Camp, first published in hardback by Doubleday in 1965 and in paperback by Curtis Books in 1970. It is the fourth of his historical novels in order of writing, and second chronologically, set in the time of Dionysios I of Syracuse at the end of the 5th and beginning of the 4th centuries BC.
Plot summary.

Having invented an improved type of catapult, he is drafted into Syracuse's war effort against Carthage by the tyrant Dionysios, creator of the first military ordnance department known to history. The historical Battle of Motya of 399 BC is a major event in the novel. Also portrayed is the incident upon which the legend of the Sword of Damocles is supposedly based.
Reception.
Contemporary reviews of the novel were favorable. Shildes Johnson in "Library Journal" "highly recommended" the book, calling it "n intriguing novel" and a "fascinating historical romance which is a worthwhile addition to any library." The author "makes his characters live, and the reader can almost imagine the social, economic, and religious milieu of this period in Grecian history."
Jackie Pettycrew in "The Arizona Republic" deemed it a "rousing piece of fiction" with an "abundance" of action whose "pace is rapid and unrelenting." She rated it an "ltogether, highly entertaining, lightly informative" book bringing ancient history "vividly to life."
"Booklist" noted its "background and synthetic [sic: sympathetic characters mingle easily in a story where action, color, page, and plot have the virile appeal evident in the author's .
Edith Farr Ridington in "Classical World" called it "an adventurous, breezy tale" with "exciting and quite believable adventures" written "in a colloquial style that helps to make ancient times come alive" and which "uses to good advantage the author's special interest in ancient engineering." She notes that "he book is spiced here and there with some frank sexualities; otherwise its appeal would seem to be especially to young people interested in a story combining mechanical devices with adventure."

Albemarle Street

Albemarle Street is a street in Mayfair in central London, off Piccadilly. It has historic associations with Lord Byron, whose publisher John Murray was based here, and Oscar Wilde, a member of the Albemarle Club, where an insult he received led to his suing for libel and to his eventual imprisonment. It is also known for its art galleries and the Brown's Hotel is located at 33 Albemarle Street.
History.
Albemarle Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by Sir Thomas Bond. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1683 and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built Bond Street and Dover Street.
Albemarle Street was the first one-way street created for the purpose of better traffic flow in London. The decision was taken after a series of lectures by Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution caused gridlock in the capital because of the horrendous queues formed by horsedrawn carriages bringing in the eager audience. Albemarle Street was made a one-way street to avoid further incidents of such congestion.
Occupants.
Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill (1864–1934), a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria and British peer, was born at 32 Albemarle Street.
Anne Lister (1791–1840), a notable Victorian lesbian, stayed at 29 Albemarle Street in rooms owned by Hawkins, who also had premises in Dover Street.
The Albemarle Club was originally in Albemarle Street and relocated to Dover Street nearby before its closure. Oscar Wilde was a member. In 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card for Wilde with the infamous note "For Oscar Wilde, posing as a somdomite" (sic). This led to Wilde's failed libel action and subsequent criminal prosecution.
The publisher John Murray was located at 50 Albemarle Street in Victorian times and during the 20th century. Lord Byron's letters were destroyed in the fireplace on the first floor after his death. Sir John Betjeman, the poet and broadcaster was another Murray author.
Frenchman Alexander Grillion opened Grillion's Hotel at No. 7 in 1803. Louis XVIII stayed here in 1814, before his return to France. It was also the meeting place of Grillion's dining club. The Royal Thames Yacht Club was later based here.
The Royal Institution is located at 21 Albemarle Street and forms an imposing backdrop on the street with its row of classical columns on its frontage. The building has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799 when the Institution was founded, and is now a Grade I listed building. Because of the Institution's popularity (through its scientific lectures), Albemarle Street became London's first one-way street to avoid traffic problems.
The naturalist Thomas Huxley founded the X Club as a dining club meeting for the first time on 3 November 1864 at St George's Hotel, Albemarle Street, with a select membership of nine proponents of the evolutionary "new reformation" in naturalism who supported the ideas of Charles Darwin and became increasingly influential in late 19th century science.
Rev. William Webb Ellis (1806–1872) was an Anglican clergyman who is famous for allegedly being the inventor of Rugby football whilst a pupil at Rugby School. He graduated from Oxford with a BA in 1829 and received his MA in 1831. He entered the Church and became chaplain of St George's Chapel, Albemarle Street, London. Where he published his 'Sermons: Preached in St. George's Chapel, Albemarle Street; to Which Is Added, an Essay On the Prophecies Relative to Christ'.[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sermons-Preached-Albemarle-Prophecies-Relative/dp/B00A6FJ8EI]
In the 1950s, Ernö Goldfinger's design for two office buildings at 45–46 Albemarle Street was praised for its sensitivity to the surrounding Georgian architecture.
Galleries.
The street is host to a number of art galleries. These include:
Location.
To the south-east, the street adjoins Piccadilly. Running parallel with Albemarle Street to the south-west is Dover Street and to the north-east are New Bond Street and Old Bond Street. The nearest tube station is Green Park.

Gonzalo Javier Rodríguez

Gonzalo Javier Rodríguez Prado (; born 10 April 1984), sometimes known as simply Gonzalo, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for ACF Fiorentina in Serie A, as a central defender.

Villarreal.
In July 2004 Rodríguez joined Spain's Villarreal CF, being an undisputed starter in his first two seasons and renewing his link for a further five years. However, after the surprise UEFA Intertoto Cup elimination at the hands of NK Maribor, in which he was sent off, and a mere month into the league season, he suffered a serious injury, tearing the cruciate ligament in his right knee; after returning to activity in April 2007, he suffered the same injury two months later.
In the 2008–09 campaign Rodríguez returned to good form, often partnering with Uruguayan Diego Godín and appearing in 48 La Liga games in two seasons combined, with Villarreal always qualifying to the UEFA Europa League, finishing fifth and seventh respectively. On 7 April 2011, in the Europa League's quarterfinals against FC Twente, he broke his fibula after a tough challenge by Marc Janko, being rushed to hospital in an ambulance and lost for the remainder of the season.
Fiorentina.
In early August 2012, following Villarreal's relegation, Gonzalo joined Italian club ACF Fiorentina, along with teammate Borja Valero.

Pedro Malo de Villavicencio

Pedro Malo de Villaviencio (sometimes "Pedro de Malo de Villaviencio") was a member of the Royal Audiencia of Mexico City in the first half of the eighteenth century. From August 1741 to November 3, 1742, he served as interim viceroy of New Spain, in his capacity as president of the Audiencia.
Dr. Malo de Villaviencio was a native of Seville, Spain. He arrived in New Spain in 1709. As prosecutor in the Audiencia, he made a comprehensive report to the viceroy on the infestation of brigands on the highway between Puebla de los Angeles and Mexico City. For this and other valuable work, the military auditor rewarded him with the rank of colonel of infantry. The auditor did this by completing one of the blank letters patent the king had supplied him to reward such services.
He was president of the Audiencia when Viceroy Pedro de Castro y Figueroa died, on August 22, 1741. In this capacity, he served as interim viceroy until April 30, 1742, when the new viceroy, Pedro Cebrián, 5th Count of Fuenclara, arrived to fill the vacancy.
