Blessingbourne House

Blessingbourne House is a large Elizabethan style manor-house situated in parkland near Fivemiletown in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.
The present house was designed by Frederick Pepys Cockerell and constructed between 1870 and 1874. It is built in an Elizabethan style of grey stone overlooking Lough Fadda and is surrounded by gardens with yew trees, a gravel terrace and a rhododendron walk. Woodland trails lead round the lake. The entire estate now comprises some s and is a working farm.
In recent times the coach house has been made available for private functions and the outbuildings converted to holiday apartments. An 8 km mountain bike trail has been newly laid out.
History.
The Blessingbourne estate came to the Montgomery family by marriage to the Armar family in the early 18th century. However the first Montgomery to actually live on the estate was Hugh Montgomery, known as “Colonel Eclipse”, who was born in 1779. He vowed he would never marry and built himself a romantic thatched cottage on the estate as a bachelor retreat. He did give way however and had a son, Hugh Ralph Severin Montgomery, who built a Tudor style gate lodge c.1845 when he succeeded to the property in 1838. 
The larger present house was built by the latter's only son, Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery, who employed Frederick Pepys Cockerell as his architect. Building stated soon after his marriage in 1870 and finished in 1874. At that time the estate covered some and straddled the border between Tyrone and Fermanagh.
It descended in the family to Peter Montgomery, Vice-Lord Lieutenant of Tyrone, who died childless, after which it passed to a cousin. The property was untimately inherited by Captain Robert Lowry, a direct descendant of Colonel Eclipse, and now belongs to Colleen and Nicholas Lowry.

Wakashoyo Shunichi

Wakashoyo Shunichi (born 8 March 1966 as Yoichi Babaguchi) is a Japanese mixed martial artist, kickboxer, professional wrestler and former sumo wrestler.
Career.
Although born in Chiba, he grew up in Nakano, Tokyo. He joined sumo in 1981, wrestling out of Futagoyama stable. He first entered the top "makuuchi" division in 1991 and made his "sanyaku" debut in March 1993 from "komusubi" rank. Unusually, he came through with a winning record (which included a win over new "yokozuna" Akebono), and was awarded his second successive special prize for Fighting Spirit. After the tournament he was promoted to "sekiwake", which was the highest rank he was to achieve. He retired in November 1997 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Otowayama. However, the retirement of his former stablemate, Wakanohana in March 2000 meant that his elder name was needed by the former Takamisugi (who had been borrowing Wakanohana's), and Wakashoyo had to leave the sumo world. 
He then signed with K-1, a kickboxing and mixed martial arts organization, fighting under his old "shikona" (He uses the Latin script, appearing as "WAKASHOYO" rather than using the Japanese characters. The Sumo Association requested that Konishiki do the same thing in his post-sumo career). He made his debut in a kickboxing bout against fellow newcomer, South Korean giant Choi Hong-man in the quarter-final of the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2005 in Seoul" on 19 March 2005. Wakashoyo was knocked down twice in the first round; he was not able to recover from the second one. In July 2005 he entered Hero's, the mixed martial arts series promoted by K-1, against kickboxing legend Peter Aerts in an MMA bout at "Hero's 2". He was again knocked out in the first round. Wakashoyo returned to the promotion against Kazuhiro Hamanaka at "Hero's 5" on 3 May 2006 and was submitted with an arm lock.
In 2008 he began using his real name, Yoichi Babaguchi, as his fighting name. However, he reverted to the name Wakashoyo in December 2010 for a kickboxing match with fellow former "sekitori" Sentoryu. Out of shape in his first match in over two and a half years, he lost in the first round.
Babaguchi, under his Wakashoyo name, started his career in professional wrestling in Inoki Genome Federation in 2008, later changing to Real Japan Pro Wrestling in 2011.
Fighting style.
During his sumo career Wakashoyo favoured "yotsu-sumo", or grappling techniques. He preferred a "hidari-yotsu", or right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent's "mawashi". His most common winning "kimarite" was "yori-kiri", or force out, but he also liked using "kotenage", or armlock throw.

J. W. C. Fegan

James William Condell Fegan (; 27 April, 1852 – 9 December, 1925) was an English Nonconformist evangelist and the founder of a succession of orphanages for boys.
Biography.
Fegan was born and reared in Southampton, where his father was a civil servant at the Ordnance Survey. Both parents were devout Non-Conformists and made the acquaintance of John Nelson Darby, the founder of the Plymouth Brethren. In 1865, the family moved to London, and James entered the City of London School, where Edwin Abbott Abbott, the young headmaster, later provided Fegan with a "glowing testimonial."
In 1869, he entered the office of colonial brokers in Mincing Lane, London; but the following year, he was suddenly converted while sitting alone reading a Greek play. He began distributing Christian tracts, teaching in the evenings at a Ragged School, and preaching at open-air meetings. The strain of working in the brokerage by day and the school by night weakened his health, and he took a vacation to Bognor Regis, where a vagrant boy caught his attention and led him toward his life's work.
On May 1, 1872, with the help of friends, Fegan opened his first boys' home at 112/114 High Street, Deptford, southeast London, and soon gained the title "Fegan of Deptford" for his work with youth in this notorious area. The number of boys soon outgrew that house and then the one next door, and he established The Little Wanderer's Home at Greenwich in 1879, with a country branch in 1881 for boys in poor health. Fegan soon became a friendly rival of the philanthropist Thomas John Barnardo, who established similar institutions in east London. Fegan was so endowed with "prodigious energy" that he was able to enlist even those in his office to help in his after-hours search for "street Arabs."
In 1882, after abandoning his business career, Fegan moved his base of activities to Southwark Street and the following year also established an orphanage at Ramsgate. In 1889, Fegan married Mary Pope, who quickly became her husband's associate, caring for him "with assiduous forethought and sympathy, and in many a tight corner advising him in the work."
During this period, emigration to other parts of the British Empire was being encouraged, and in 1884, Fegan took ten boys—and then fifty more—to Canada in 1884. A "distributing home" was given to him in Toronto, and from there annual parties of boys were sent to farms in various parts of the country. The boys were encouraged to repay the cost of their passage and outfits to make the same opportunity available for others, and many of them did so. By 1907, Canadian emigrants had sent more than $11,000 back to England, and their names were inscribed on copper plates at the English orphanages.
After the expiration of the lease on the Greenwich property in 1900, Fegan decided to move the orphanage to the country and in a spirit of "divine recklessness" offered £4,500 for a building at Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire worth ten times that amount. The mortgage holder readily agreed to sell if payment were made within two weeks, and Fegan duly raised the sum after meeting with his friends for nightly prayer.
In 1913 Fegan vacated the Southwark Street property and opened another building at 62-64 Horseferry Road, which he called "The Red Lamp" because of the light left on at night to signal assistance given to anyone who needed shelter whatever the hour. To prepare boys for emigration to Canada, Fegan also established at Goudhurst in Kent a farm using Canadian farming methods and implements. By the 1920s the farm included a home for Fegan and his wife, which they called Blantyre Lodge after one of their earliest supporters Lord Blantyre.
Fegan died at the Goudhurst farm on December 9, 1925. His wife continued his work until she was killed in an air raid that struck the farm in October 1945.
Acquaintance with Charles Darwin.
In 1880, Fegan's parents moved to Downe, a village about fourteen miles from central London, and Fegan spent a great deal of time there with his widowed mother during the summers of 1881-83. Charles Darwin lived nearby, and once when Fegan took his boys camping in the neighborhood, they sang hymns in front of his residence, Down House. Darwin expressed sympathy for Fegan's philanthropic work and (to ringing cheers) gave each of the boys sixpence. 
Fegan also held regular tent services in the area, and when he needed a more permanent base of operations, he asked Darwin for the use of a slightly frequented temperance reading room Darwin had established for the villagers. Darwin lent it with pleasure, complimenting Fegan that he had "done more for the village in a few months than all our efforts for many years. We have never been able to reclaim a drunkard, but through your services I do not know that there is a drunkard left in the village."
Late in Fegan's life, after Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope had publicized a story about how Darwin had recanted his belief in evolution, Fegan was asked to pronounce on the story's truthfulness, presumably because in the 1880s Hope had worked with him in Downe. In 1925 Fegan wrote that he "had been appealed to over and over again as to the probability of this story, and have had no hesitation in pronouncing it to be fabrication on the part of poor Lady Hope." Darwin, said Fegan, "was an honorable, courteous, benevolent gentleman; but you may be sure that Sir Francis Darwin is right in saying that his father died as he had lived—an agnostic."
Personality.
Even a private secretary who greatly admired Fegan called him "autocratic, dictatorial and impatient, for he was a perfectionist and did not suffer fools gladly." Nevertheless, the secretary also credited his employer with considerable human sympathy and a fine sense of humor.

Twin Bracelets

Twin Bracelets is a film produced in 1990 by Cosmopolitan Film Productions Co., a Hong Kong-based company that forms part of the film production conglomerate run by the Shaw brothers who are the owners of the Shaw Brothers Studio. S.L.Wei notes that “Twin Bracelets was shown at international film festivals.” It has “won the 1992 San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Film Festival Award for Best Feature.” John Charles called Twin Bracelets “(a) somber, engrossing drama” that is “marred only by the inevitability of its narrative.” The film has been labeled a ‘lesbian’ film, but also a ‘feminist’ film. Some critics have also focused on what they took to be its ethnological aspects. Such aspects do indeed form the background of Zhaohuan Lu’s short story ‘The Twin Bracelets’ (1986) which served as the basis of the film script written by the film director, Yu-shan Huang. Huang Yushan who initially worked for Central Motion Picture Company (CMPC) and for the Shaw Bros. is a director who has made a choice in favor of independent film. In her life and work she is attached to feminism. According to Bérénice Reynaud, she is “one of the rare women to work in the Taiwanese film industry.” Prof Lai has called Yu-shan Huang “Taiwan's major feminist director.” S.L. Wei sees Huang as “an important voice in Taiwanese women's cinema. The fact that her film Twin Bracelets received relatively much attention “enabled Huang to have in-depth discussions with American independent filmmakers and feminist directors. From then on she began to push consciously forward [with films about women.”
A feminist movie.
Twin Bracelets was shot in Hui An, a remote coastal village of Fujian (a southern province of the People’s Republic of China). The film is a stark denunciation of the culturally specific ‘machismo’ of Chinese men, as observed in a traditional coastal village. Juxtaposed to it, we find poetic scenes that portray female tenderness, as found in girls and young women who have not yet succumbed to the so-called realities of life. 
The two female protagonists, Hsiu and Hui-hua, have not yet surrendered their dreams when we observe them in the initial sequences of the film. But it is clear that they cannot escape the pressures of village society. Whatever their subjective longings, how can they turn a blind eyes to the expectations of their next of kin that are anchored in tradition? We see that these expectations are in turn influenced by social customs and by fear of gossip among neighbors. But also by the spontaneous comprehension that social roles have to be accepted if families want to make ends meet and if the local economy of a fishing village is to function ‘as it always did.’ 
When Hui-hua succumbs to the expectations of her family that, at her age, she should marry and obey her husband, Xiu commits suicide. The one surrenders to the ‘force of circumstances’ – the others finds only a self-destructive way out. Yet this act expresses her rebellion, her protest and revolt, and it lays bare the source of the female alliance of hope and the alternative vision it embodied. Instead of wife-beating, it was caresses that these young human beings longed for when they made their initial vow to each other that they would never marry. They had sensed the injustice enshrined in the old game of master and slave, they did not want words and deeds that boss and command and leave no alternative. They desired human respect, equality, careful awareness of each other's needs. And for a short time, enabled by their affection for each other, they lived like that, turning to each other, experiencing the secluded, intimate freedom of a human relationship that was genuine and reciprocal in their acceptance of each other's dignity. It was like this that exploitation could give way to cooperation, rule to freedom. It embodies, as a relationship of merely two human beings, an entire vision of how humans could live together.
When the film turns to the intimate scenes that show the closeness of these young women who comprehend their relationship in a traditional way, by seeing themselves as ‘sister-spouses,’ we begin to understand their affection for each other as the support that is necessary to resist the wrong, antiquated, patriarchal social relations that dominate village society. It is the affectionate bond between them that gives them strength to resist.
The formal language of the film.
Twin Bracelets, which was the second feature done by Yu-shan Huang, is a solidly realized, thoughtful film. In terms of its filmic form, it is conventional cinema. It is narrative cinema, telling a story chronologically, without any flash backs. Its attraction and significance clearly is due to its subject matter. How this subject matter is treated has made it an interesting and, in the eyes of some viewers, a controversial film.
As narrative cinema, Twin Bracelets departs, however, from the Western norm. It is Chinese. This is especially apparent in that the actresses occasionally rely to some extent on Chinese conventions of acting which a Western audience is hardly acquainted with. This has occasionally caused irritation. It is hard to tell who or what is to blame in this case. Is it Western rejection of other canons and conventions than their own? Is it the fact that the filmmaker chose to work with what the product information of the company describes as a “cast and crew of newcomers”? Or the Chinese director’s halfhearted reliance, at least in some scenes, on the conventions of the Chinese Opera which have seeped into film-making and, more crudely, into soap operas?
It is clear that these are acting conventions that Taiwanese, Hong Kong and mainland audience are familiar with, on account of innumerable films and soap operas that fulfill purposes of entertainment, distraction, and ideological indoctrination. They are stylized movements and gestures that long established convention invests with fixed meanings. And they reappear even in everyday situations (thus, outside television, drama, and film) as stereotyped behavior. Girls for instance have their peculiar movements that symbolize a need to express embarrassment or slight shame. They may rely on them when conventional morality (or their superego, the Freudian ‘ueber-ich’) requires it. The gestures thus relied on are translatable by Xiū xiū 羞羞 (‘I’m ashamed’). Such ways of acting are to some extent watered-down adaptations of an entire repertoire of very formal, stylistically refined conventions of the Peking Opera, or of coarser, but also heartier varieties that exist in the form of local opera genres. The latter tend to be more down-to-earth and they are meant to address the sociocultural needs and appetites of the common people. (They are typically performed in the evening on makeshift stages in public squares or at street corners, the stage being protected by canvas against the rain.) 
It is clear that ‘modernist’ Western art theory rejects these conventions, especially in their trivialized form. Viktor Shklovsky would have referred to them as “automatic” or “automatized.” It is also not really surprising if this acting appears as overdone to Western viewers accustomed to the naturalism of Elia Kazan, John Ford, or John Huston. On the other hand, Western audiences accept the routine acting that is typical of a certain, glossy variety of 'naturalism' that nowadays seems to define the norm of professional acting in Hollywood. 
There is nothing to be said against stylized acting. The anti-naturalist theater author and stage director Bert Brecht, who thought highly of Mei Lanfang, relied on it in his epic theatre. So did Brechtian film directors, most notably Daniele Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub (see Straub-Huillet ). What can be said against occasional reliance of Chinese conventions of acting in Yu-shan Huang‘s feature film is that this acting is not stylized enough and that it is integrated in what remains basically a naturalist film. Does it jar? Is the occasional use of conventional, stylized acting hardly noticed by Chinese audiences because it is considered as ‘normal’ and as a ‘naturalist’ representation of how young Chinese women may ‘act’? This remains open to debate.
Critical reception.
Viewing Twin Bracelets as a lesbian film.
Discussing Twin Bracelets, a number of critics make lesbianism its main cause. Teri Silvio noted that Twin Bracelets “was seen as a ‘Lesbian film’ in the United States and by some people in Taiwan.” The filmmaker, collaborating with Chun-chi Wang, explained it was due to “the way the film treats same-sex romantic love and friendship among women” that it was “taken as a Lesbian story” in the West. 
And Vivian Price said that “the film’s representation of women rejecting oppression resembles the lesbian utopia envisioned in the West.” 
Marie K. Morohoshi states in an interview that Twin Bracelets, just like another movie she mentions (The East is Red), has “the great gender bender thing going on throughout the film…or a subtext.” In her view, the film “is so ‘clearly’ lesbian that it can’t be anything but lesbian.” According to Vivian Ng, who resents the fact that “one of the women commit(s) suicide at the end of the story,” the film does not present a positive image of lesbians. The same view is held by the filmmaker Paul Lee.
Other critics in the West have also focused on sexuality as a presumed key subject matter of the film. Referring specifically to Yu-shan Huang’s Twin Bracelets, the French film critic Bérénice Reynaud assumes that her treatment of sexual desire is explained or at least partly influenced by the fact that she is one of those Taiwanese filmmakers who “spent some time abroad.”
The tendency to overemphasis the sexual aspect of liberation was strong in the West because of a Puritan western heritage that has fanned guilt feelings for centuries. In the context of East Asian societies marked by Confucian patriarchal ideology, it is shame, rather than guilt, that is a typical psychological reaction when boundaries defined by traditional morality are crossed. 
Lisa Odham Stokes and Michael Hoover put more emphasis on “the oppression experienced by two women” and the fact that they were expected to submit to “arrange marriages." This confirms the feminist interpretation of the filmmaker.
Calling Twin Bracelets a “remarkable film,” one author saw the film as “a deeply moving and tragic portray of one woman’s struggle for independence.” This acknowledged at least the feminist orientation of the film. But then the writer went on to say that it is also (or above all?) a struggle “for the love of another woman. Desperately in love with Hsiu, Hui-ha flirts shamelessly with her” and is “intensely jealous of Hsiu’s arranged marriage.” 
In line with the interpretation of the film as a lesbian film, certain Western authors see the “inevitable” course of events as an ideological nexus between sinful desire, thus guilt, and necessary punishment. Thus, one author felt that “Twin Bracelets by Huang Yu-Shan […] deals with the impossible price that must be paid as punishment for the transgression of conventional desires.” Apparently ignorant of Chinese socioculture which is not characterized by a Christian defamation of sexuality or haunted by guilt feelings associated with sexual desire, many Western critics typically underestimated the extent to which conflict with traditional customs and disrespect for or rebellion against traditional authority (of governments, superiors, fathers, husbands) is sanctioned. To the extent that the suspicion of lesbian love would have been aroused in the village, it would have been the departure from convention, not desire as such that would have given rise to disapproval. But a refusal to fulfill conventional expectations to get married and accept the role of a dutiful, obedient wife is clearly something that evokes greater scorn than any revelation of desire. And it is such a departure from the norm that leads to corresponding moral sanctions. Feminists like Yu-shan Huang turn against this traditional world view and thus against an ideology that has always evoked the age-old teachings of Confucius while serving to maintain repressive social and political relations that are contemporary.
The ethnographic focus.
According to Yu-shan Huang and Chun-chi Wang, “(t)he subject matter of … Twin Bracelets is taken from the tradition of the ‘zishu nü’ (‘the women who comb their hair’ - a term for women who are self-sufficient) in Hui’an, Fujian and its environs…” Lingzhen Wang writes that the film “focuses on Fujian local tradition of female sisterhood” or “female bonding.” This appears to put the accent on a special constellation, rooted in Huidong socioculture. 
In 1994, the ethnologist Sara Friedman went to Fujian to do field work in eastern Hui’an. Here she noted that married woman were reluctant to visit their husband’s home. In 1995 she did further research in Hui’an, staying for “eighteen month in the Huidong village of Shanlin.” While in Shanlin, Friedman showed a particular interest in the kind of group suicide, committed by women, “that inspired … Lu Zhaohuan to pen the short story ‘Shuang zhuo’ (Twin Bracelets) about the relationship between two female(s) … in a Huidong village.”
It is possible that Friedman’s research interest was fanned not only by the story but also by the more widely noted film Twin Bracelets which also culminates in a suicide, though not of two women, but of one woman. A significant detail which indicates a difference between Lu Zhaohuan’s story that was adapted by the film director and the film that was made.
It was Fran Martin who first has pointed out the nexus between Zhaohuan Lu’s story ‘Twin Bracelets’ and Yu-shan Huang’s film. He also supplies a specific ‘explanation’ of the opposition to marriage exhibited by the film’s young female protagonists. According to him, it is the “strict ethnic (marriage) custom” which “dictates that husbands and wives must live separately.” Fran Martin thinks that “the film stages a critique of the harshness of the local marriage customs.” He thus chooses the ethnologically oriented approach. But he also deciphers a lesbian alternative that the young protagonists temporarily enact in his opinion. He writes that Yu-shan Huang is “setting these (sc. harsh marriage customs) against the loving bonds between two women” who “vow to remain unmarried and live as ‘sister-spouses’ (jiemei fuqi)” but whose choice is finally “defeated by the pressures towards cross-sex marriage.” In view of this interpretation it is not surprising that some writers with ties to Taiwan chose to depict the entire constellation as either exceptional or as an expression of backwardness still found in the People’s Republic of China. Thus, an author suggested in the U.S.-China Review that
“(v)iewers of The Twin Bracelets” may of course “ask, in the light of the film’s contemporary settings, whether these unusual social phenomenon still exist in China (…).” The implications of this reading are obvious: The film is either about the past or about a place that certainly is not identifiable as Taiwan. It serves a voyeur’s appetite for the exotic, the strange. This is a notion that the filmmaker sharply disagreed with, however.
Recognition of the feminist critique of social relations.
Fran Martin is not blind to the feminist impulse that motivated the choice of Zhaohuan Lu’s short story. He notes that the girls object to “the violently patriarchal marriage custom.” Now it is indeed true that the film portrays coarse behavior and male violence that is informed by a patriarchal sense of being in charge, whereas a woman should know her place and must obey. But the marriage custom as such, stipulating separate households of husband and wife, gives women an unusual free space and a certain measure of independence. The specific marriage custom of the ethnic Huidong group living in Fujian (SW China) is certainly no longer matriarchal like that of the Mosuo based in Yunnan (also SW China). But it tends in that direction, a fact that must have aroused the filmmakers interest in the Huidong. 
Huang could have chosen Mosuo women as a positive example, if she had wanted to go to extremes in constructing a utopia (which does not exist – not even in Mosuo society).
Instead, she chose working people in a contemporary Chinese coastal village. A Huidong village, it is true. Still, the filmmaker does not idealize anything with regard to the Huidong of this village. Nor does she probe their custom deeply. Instead, she accentuates the harsh facts of everyday relations between man and woman that exist even here and that could have been observed in Taiwan villages or working-class neighborhoods, as well. She chose a situation that she could critique.
In pre-war China, influenced by the May 4th movement, progressive writers with sympathies for the cause of women chose that strategy, too. Authors of that period wrote scathing depictions of newly-wed Chinese women subjected to the tyranny of mother-in-laws in their husband’s household. To the husband and his parents, they often were not much more than a water buffalo that pulls the plow. In other words, a cheap female worker, and if they were lucky, also a mother of future male offspring. To the parents of the girl ‘sent away’ to the young husband’s household (which inevitably was that of the husband’s father), the daughter that had left the parental home was ‘no more than a bucket of water, emptied in front of the door.’ On principle, the daughter could not return to her parents, regardless of how badly she was treated in her new domicile. To welcome her back would bring shame on her parents. 
It is the impulse to critique the effects of patriarchal customs and patriarchally structured social relations that has kept the filmmaker from focusing on positive traits of Huidong society, which allows women to live separately. On the contrary, we note that in the film, Hui-ha is criticized when she “run(s) home to her mother.” This is a typical ingredient not of the exceptional Huidong society but of traditional Chinese mainstream society. 
The ethnological focus of certain film critics on the short story that preceded the film deflects the critique of Chinese patriarchal patterns that survive in today’s mainstream society, both on the mainland and in Taiwan. Yushan Huang’s adaptation of Zhaohuan Lu’s story can be compared to Brecht’s adaptation of an older tale which served as the narrative thread of his play The Caucasian Chalk Circle. What is seemingly distant in terms of time and place, is in fact our own reality subjected to the Brechtian artistic device of making the familiar look strange in order to allow a new scrutiny and discovery of everything that is scandalous with regard to it. Clearly, the plot of Zhaohuan Lu’s story serves only as a pretext for the film’s narrative. This narrative focuses first, on Hsiu’s enforced surrender to tradition-based social custom and the male dominance it implies. And secondly, on Hui-hua’s final tragic rebellion. But this rebellion is not represented as a lesson which might warn other women not to rebel, as some pro-Lesbian feminist film critics assumed. On the contrary, the film’s strategy, in this respect, is entirely in line with the paradigm of such writers critical of tradition as Ye Shengtao, Lao She and Lu Xun. That Hui-hua sees no way out but to commit suicide is a red-hot accusation of a society which is wrong and which requires drastic change. Yu-shan Huang called it “the film’s strong protest at the way patriarchal ideology oppresses women.”

The paaltjasker was built in 1978 for the Floriade (flower show) of 1982 and was left behind after its end. It was restored in 2003 after being derelict for some years, though it is not really functional because of its sheltered position. The tjasker has four Common sails. It is located in the public park surrounding the Gaasperplas lake and can be reached on foot.
Arnhem (Gelderland).
<br>
The boktjasker was built around 1875 near Wâlterswâld. It was donated to the Netherlands Open Air Museum and re-erected there in 1928 as a static object. It was moved to a different site in the museum grounds in 2002 after spending some years in storage though still not operational because of its sheltered wind free location. The tjasker has four Common sails, which have a span of , making it the largest tjasker in the Netherlands. It is also one of only three "boktjaskers" left in the Netherlands. The mill can be visited during opening hours of the museum.
Bleskensgraaf (Zuid-Holland).
<br>
The paaltjasker was built by Chiel de Graaf from Oud Verlaat for owner Aad Schouten in 1987. It is located next to hollow post mill Wingerdse Molen. The tjasker has four Common sails, which have a span of and is fully functional.
Nieuw-Scheemda (Groningen).
<br>
The paaltjasker was built as an unemployment project of municipally Scheemda in 1992. It was erected near Midwolda to raise water into a small nature reserve. However this site proved problematic because of trees and shrubs and lack of public access so the mill was moved to Nieuw-Scheemda in 2001. It is now located close to drainage windmill De Dellen and is also operated by the volunteer miller of that mill. The tjasker has four Common sails, which have a span of . The mill is dismantled and stored indoors during the winter season and is owned by "Molenstichting Oldambt".
Zuidschermer (Noord-Holland).
<br>
The paaltjasker was built in 1987 and is located in front of the owners farmhouse. It was built by the former owner of the farmhouse J. Blakeman and has four Common sails, which have a span of .

Lewis Corner of "Digital Spy" blog gave the song a positive review stating:
As such, we breathed a sigh of relief when the four-piece confirmed 'Baby Come Home' as their next single. Partly because its mix of bouncy piano and funky guitar is more addictive than a game of Temple Run, but mainly because it recalls classic Scissor Sisters circa 2004.

Alexis Jordan discography

The discography of American recording artist Alexis Jordan consists of one studio album, four singles (including one as a featured artist) and five music videos.
Jordan rose to fame when she finished as a semi-finalalist on the first season of America's Got Talent in 2006. After being eliminated from the show, Jordan and her family moved to Atlanta to be closer to the music industry. While there, she began to upload cover songs on YouTube while submitting demos. By 2008, Jordan's YouTube page was racking up millions of views. The exposure led Jordan to the attention of production team Stargate who called her to fly to New York and record a few songs with them. While in the studio, rapper Jay-Z walked in, which ultimately resulted in Jordan becoming the first artist signed to the new, Sony Music-affiliated label, StarRoc/Roc Nation – a joint venture between Stargate and Jay-Z's Roc Nation label. Her debut single Happiness was released in September 2010 and topped the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States and became a top three hit in the United Kingdom and Australia. In Australia, "Happiness" was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments of 210,000 copies. 
"Good Girl" was released as Jordan's second single in February 2011. The song debuted at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart, giving Jordan her second top-10 hit in the United Kingdom. It also reached No. 15 in Ireland and became her second chart-topper on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Songs chart in April. Her self-titled debut album was released on February 25, 2011. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 9 and on the Australian Albums Chart at No. 11. "Hush Hush" was released as the album's third single on May 8, 2011.
Jordan also featured on Sean Paul's single "Got 2 Luv U", which reached number one in Switzerland and Bulgaria.
On December 28, 2013 Alexis confirmed that the lead single from her upcoming second studio album (scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2014) will be titled "Gone" and it will be released on March 1, 2014. Its video premiered the day before on Jordan's official Youtube channel.

Bloodmoon (1990 film)

Bloodmoon is a 1990 Australian slasher film about killings at a school.
Production.
It was shot on the Gold Coast.
Release.
The film was released with a "fright break" towards the end where the audience had a chance to walk out and claim a refund.
Critical reception.
AllMovie called it a "silly Australian slasher film". Jim Schembri wrote in "Cinema Papers" that:
It is an unspeakably funny film, but in the saddest possible way. It is a film promoted as a horror film, and it is for anyone with any faith left in Australian mainstream film... For a film as awful, as cliche ridden, as derivative as unimaginative and as poorly made as "Bloodmoon" to be made in Australia in 1990 is a cause of national mourning.

Eric Reid (American football)

Eric Todd Reid (born December 10, 1991) is an American football safety for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Louisiana State University (LSU), and received All-American recognition. He was considered one of the top safety prospects in his class, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft.
Early life.
Reid was born to Eric and Sharon Reid in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He attended Dutchtown High School in Geismar, Louisiana, and played for the Dutchtown Griffins high school football team. He played in the 2010 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
College career.
Reid enrolled in Louisiana State University, where he played for coach Les Miles' LSU Tigers football team from 2010 to 2012. As a freshman in 2010, played in 13 games with three starts. He finished the season with 32 tackles and two interceptions. As a first-year starter as a sophomore in 2011, Reid recorded 76 tackles, two interceptions and two forced fumbles. He was named a second-team All-American by Rivals.com and was a second team All-SEC selection by the Associated Press. Reid also played in the 2010 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
As a junior in 2012, he started all 13 games at safety and finished third on the team in tackles with 91 (42 unassisted), two interceptions, and seven pass breakups. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from the American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, ESPN, and Scout.com, and second-team honors from the Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, Athlon Sports, CBSsports.com, and "Sports Illustrated".

In his NFL debut in the Week 1 win against the Green Bay Packers in San Francisco, he recorded his first career interception on a pass thrown by Aaron Rodgers. In the following game against the Seahawks, he recorded another interception. However, in that game, he sustained a concussion. In one of his best games of the year, Reid notched an interception and recovered a fumble against the Arizona Cardinals. Later in the season, against the Carolina Panthers, he was concussed again.

Mooskappe

The Mooskappe is an old, traditional miners head covering. It was intended to protect miners when working underground from the impact of small rockfalls and from hitting their heads against the gallery roof ("Firste"). The term is German and this type of hat was worn especially in the Harz Mountains of Germany.
It is known that the "Mooskappe" was definitely used in the Harz and Barsinghausen mining regions. It appears in steel engravings from about 1850, for example by Wilhelm Ripe, as an important item of safety gear. In 1824 Heinrich Heine visited the "Caroline" and "Dorothea" mines at Clausthal. He wrote about these visits in various places including in his work "Die Harzreise" where he says:
The "Mooskappe" was usually made of a hard, green felt, but there were also "crocheted" ("gehäkelte") designs. The shape is either clearly cylindrical but it can also be dome-shaped.

Duffy Site

The Duffy Site is a substantial archaeological site along the Wabash River in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Illinois. Located near the village of New Haven in Gallatin County, it is the type site for the Duffy Complex, a group of similar sites on the Illinois side of the Wabash near its confluence with the Ohio River. Duffy is distinctive largely because of its pottery: the site's inhabitants typically produced ceramics of various thicknesses and comparatively few decorative elements, tempered with grog. What decorations exist are typically limited to one or two rows of simple lines or bars that have been incised or stamped on the side of the piece of pottery. Projectile points found at the site are small triangular "Mounds Stemless" points, and the inhabitants produced celts of a vaguely rectangular shape. The site is believed to have been inhabited circa AD 1000.
Duffy is clearly related to sites of the Yankeetown Complex, which is named for the Yankeetown Site on the Ohio River east of Evansville, Indiana. Like Duffy, the people of Yankeetown produced grog-tempered pottery with few details other than incisions, although differences between Duffy and Yankeetown pottery are substantial enough to rule out a close connection between the two peoples. Nevertheless, the two sites share certain cultural influences: both feature Late Woodland elements, and as Yankeetown appears to show the beginnings of an indigenous form of the Mississippian culture, Duffy bears some evidence of Mississippian influence. Other Illinois sites potentially related to the Duffy Complex include Carrier Mills in Saline County, which shows some Duffy influence, and Gallatin County's Illinois Salines, which has yielded pottery more closely resembling that of Duffy than that of Yankeetown. The latter site appears to have been under Duffy control as the region was transitioning from terminal Late Woodland to Mississippian.
In 1977, the Duffy Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its archaeological importance; it is one of seven Gallatin County locations on the Register, as is the Great Salt Spring.

Theatre music

Theatre music refers to a wide range of music composed or adapted for performance in theatres. Genres of theatre music include opera, ballet and several forms of musical theatre, from pantomime to operetta and modern stage musicals and revues. Another form of theatre music is incidental music, which, as in radio, film and television, is used to accompany the action or to separate the scenes of a play. The physical embodiment of the music is called a score, which includes the music and, if there are lyrics, it also shows the lyrics.
History.
Since the earliest days of the theatre, music has played an important part in stage drama. In Greek drama in the fifth century BC, choric odes were written to be chanted and danced between the spoken sections of both tragedies and comedies. Only fragments of the music have survived. Attempts to recreate the form for revivals from the Renaissance to modern times have branched in several directions. Composers from Andrea Gabrieli to Mendelssohn to Vaughan Williams have composed chorus music for productions of plays by Sophocles, Aristophanes and others. Playwrights including Racine, Yeats and Brecht wrote original plays in styles derived from ancient drama, with sung commentaries by a chorus or narrator. In late 16th century Florence, attempts to revive ancient Greek drama, with sung vocal contributions, developed into the modern genre of opera. Folk theatre has always deployed dance music and song. 
The writer Roger Savage notes in "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians": "The classic forms of Asian theatre from India to Japan rely heavily on music, as do the dramatic rituals of sub-Saharan Africa and of the indigenous peoples of the Americas." In Western theatre genres, Savage writes that music features importantly in medieval liturgical drama, ballet de cour, ballet d'action, classical ballet, modern dance, 18th-century pantomime, comédie-ballet, semi-opera, 18th-century vaudeville, ballad opera, Singspiel, opéra comique, operetta, musical comedy, the musical, and other forms of musical theatre. In common with radio, cinema and television, the theatre has long made use of incidental music to accompany spoken drama.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, theatre music was performed during the action of plays and as afterpieces. Christopher R. Wilson, discussing Shakespeare's use of music, lists "stage music" (fanfares to introduce important characters or accompany battle scenes), "magic music" (as in the lullaby in "A Midsummer Night's Dream"), "character music" (as in "Twelfth Night", illustrating the high, low, sad or merry natures of the characters) and "atmospheric music" (such as Ariel's "Where the bee sucks", in "The Tempest"). By the early 18th century, music was firmly established as part of practically all theatrical performances in Europe, whether of opera, dance, or spoken drama. Theatres were built with orchestra pits, and music was either specially composed for the production or appropriated and arranged from existing material.

Controversies of Kirill I of Moscow

This is a list of controversies of Kirill I of Moscow.
Links with the KGB.
In the early 1990s and later on, Kirill was accused of having links to the KGB during much of the Soviet period, as were many members of the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy, and of pursuing the state’s interests before those of the Church. His alleged KGB agent’s codename was "Mikhailov".
Importation of cigarettes.
Journalists of the newspapers "Kommersant" and "Moskovskij Komsomolets" accused Kirill of profiteering and abuse of the privilege of duty-free importation of cigarettes granted to the Church in the mid-1990s and dubbed him "Tobacco Metropolitan". The Department for External Church Relations was alleged to have acted as the largest supplier of foreign cigarettes in Russia. Kirill’s personal wealth was estimated to be $1.5 billion by sociologist Nikolai Mitrokhin in 2004, and at $4 billion by "The Moscow News" in 2006. However, Nathaniel Davis noted that "...There is no evidence that Metropolitan Kirill has actually embezzled funds. What is more likely is that profits from the importation of tobacco and cigarettes have been used for urgent, pressing Church expenses." The duty-free importation of cigarettes ended in 1997. In his 2002 interview with "Izvestia", Metropolitan Kirill called the allegations about his profiteering a political campaign against him.
Pussy Riot and accusations of extravagance.
Three female members of an anarchist artistic group called Pussy Riot were arrested in March 2012 for performing a brief song in the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow during which they called on the Virgin Mary to "chase Putin out". The women (two of them mothers) were arrested for hooliganism, faced up to seven years in jail, and were later sentenced to two years. Commenting on the case, Kirill said they were "doing the work of Satan" and should be punished. This sparked criticism of the Orthodox Church on the Runet for not showing mercy, while Amnesty International described the women as "prisoners of conscience". Bloggers also began to openly criticise Kirill's perceived extravagant lifestyle: when accused of wearing a Swiss Breguet watch worth over £20,000, Kirill denied having worn it, saying that any photographs showing him wearing it must be fakes. However, photographs on his official website showed it on his wrist and one even showed it airbrushed out, but with a reflection of it still visible on a table surface. Kirill responded by saying that "the guilty ones the image manipulation will be punished severely". A spokesperson added that it was "unethical" to discuss Kirill's private life, and the Russian Orthodox Church said on 4 April 2012 that foreign forces were taking revenge on it for supporting Putin: "The attacks have become more prominent during the pre-election and post-election period [... This] shows their political and also anti-Russian motives."
"Gold" dust of the Patriarch.
In March 2012, the former RF Health minister (1999–2004) Yury Shevchenko, pursuant to the court ruling, paid about 20 million rubles ($676,000) in compensation for the dust resultant from the renovation work that had settled in a flat upstairs in the prestigious House on the Embankment privately owned by Gundyayev (Patriarch Kirill) and occupied by the Patriarch's long-time friend businesswoman Lidia Leonova. According to the media reports, the former minister is personally acquainted with the then RF prime-minister Vladimir Putin.
"I sold my apartment in St. Petersburg, and we paid the required sum," said Shevchenko's son, also Yury, in early April 2012.
According to the lawsuit, renovation works in Shevchenko's apartment stirred up a lot of dust, which settled on a collection of valuable books owned by Kirill. The Patriarch confirmed his ownership of the dusty apartment in a private conversation with journalist Vladimir Solovyov.
Most of the reports in the media tended to be critical of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, pointing out that it was just sand and it would have been far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.
Silver Shoe Award.
In June, 2012, Kirill was given the Silver Shoe Award (given in Russia each year “for the most dubious achievements in show business") for "immaculate disappearance of a watch” in the category "Miracles up to the elbows”. The award found a pained reaction from representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church 
Nomination for Nobel Prize.
In 2012 the Russian Consumer Rights Protection Society sued the church management for alleged commercial operations in Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Church representatives stated in court that goods dispensed for money in the cathedral were actually religious items handed out as free gifts in exchange for voluntary "recommended donations." Judge Kananovich agreed with this reasoning and defeated the claim.
In August 2012 Mikhail Anashkov, the head of the Consumer Rights Protection Society, in his sarcastic open letter nominated Kirill and Kananovich for the Nobel Prize in Economics because they disproved the basic tenet of the economic theory that defines the exchange of goods for money as "commerce".
Same sex marriage and the Apocalypse.
In August 2013, Kirill publicly spoke out against gay rights, declaring same sex marriage a sign of the impending Apocalypse. 
Gay Sex Scandal at Kazan Theological Academy.
However in December 2013 there were reports throughout the Russian Media that there had been a scandal at the Kazan Theological Seminary involving homosexual conduct between teachers and ordinands for which an Archimandrite who was the Vice-Rector had been dismissed. The matter was reported by Protodeacon Andrei Kuraev who was summarily removed from his post on the Patriarch's Theological Commission merely for commenting on the scandal.

Joan Darrah

Joan Darrah is an activist for LGBT rights, specifically the end of the "don't ask don't tell" (DADT) policy, which prohibited gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members from being open about their sexual orientation.
Darrah joined the Navy in 1972, unaware that she was a lesbian, and retired in June 2002 as a captain. At one point in her career, she supervised 1500 people at Naval Intelligence Command, including openly gay civilians. Darrah was a Navy officer who narrowly escaped being killed in the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon, which caused her to reevaluate the harm the policy was causing to her life. Due to this, she retired in 2002 after serving for thirty years.
In pursuit of ending DADT, in 2006 she founded and chaired a Mount Vernon Unitarian Church (MVUC) Task Force, and in 2007, she and several other MVUC members collected signatures and successfully advocated for a Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) Action of Immediate Witness (AIW) to repeal DADT.
She testified at a House Armed Services Committee hearing in July 2008 to advocate the repeal of DADT. She said she would not join the Navy as a lesbian with DADT in place, now that she understood how stressful it would prove. She cited the inability of a homosexual servicemember to seek redress for harassment. In response to another witness who said "unit cohesion is a leadership issue", she said:
She did media interviews, such as PBS's Diane Rehm Show and C-SPAN's Washington Journal, ABC's Good Morning America, NBC Nightly News and Barry Lynn's Culture Shocks. She lobbied Congress and was a leader in the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. She wrote an open letter to the President advocating for the repeal of DADT, which was published on the Service Members Legal Defense Network website. She also wrote an opinion piece for CNN in 2010 titled "My secret life under 'don't ask, don't tell'" in which she detailed the hardships the policy had caused her as a gay woman.
Darrah is the partner of Lynne Kennedy, an openly gay reference librarian at the Library of Congress. They married on December 17, 2010, after twenty years together, one day before the Senate voted to repeal DADT. At the invitation of the White House, she attended the ceremony at which President Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In 2012, Darrah wrote an opinion article for CNN titled "Respect Sally Ride's decision not to come out."

List of places of worship in Tonbridge and Malling

The borough of Tonbridge and Malling, one of 13 local government districts in the English county of Kent, has more than 80 current and former places of worship. Many are in the ancient town of Tonbridge, the largest centre of population in the mostly rural area, but many of the surrounding villages and hamlets have their own places of worship—including ancient Anglican parish churches, Nonconformist chapels and modern buildings serving a wide variety of Christian denominations. As of , 63 places of worship are in use in the borough, and a further 21 former churches and chapels no longer hold religious services but survive in alternative uses.
The majority of Tonbridge and Malling's residents identify themselves as Christian. The borough has nearly 40 Anglican churches serving the Church of England, the country's Established Church. Buildings of many styles and sizes are used for Anglican worship: from the tiny tin tabernacles at Hadlow Stair and Golden Green to the expansive stone-built edifices at East Malling and Aylesford, and from Saxon- and Norman-era churches (as at Snodland and Wouldham) to 20th-century buildings in wayside hamlets and on suburban housing estates. Non-Anglican worshippers are accommodated in a variety of mostly 19th- and 20th-century chapels and meeting rooms: Baptists, Methodists and Roman Catholics each have several churches, and smaller religious groups such as Open Brethren and Jehovah's Witnesses can also be found in the borough.
English Heritage has awarded listed status to 37 places of worship in Tonbridge and Malling borough. A building is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of "exceptional interest"; Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest"; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of "special interest". As of February 2001, there were 38 Grade I-listed buildings, 74 with Grade II* status and 1,179 Grade II-listed buildings in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling.
Overview of the borough and its places of worship.
Tonbridge and Malling borough covers of the Kentish Weald in the west of Kent, England's southeasternmost county. Clockwise from the north, it shares borders with the borough of Gravesham, the city and unitary authority of Medway, the boroughs of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells and the district of Sevenoaks, all of which are in Kent.
Like many Kentish towns, Tonbridge developed along a main road at a river crossing and grew rapidly in the 19th century, but its ancient origins are visible in its castle and the nearby parish church dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. Victorian growth stimulated by the opening of several railway lines encouraged more Anglican churches to be built: prolific ecclesiastical architect Ewan Christian provided three new churches, all of which remain open. One—St John the Evangelist's Church (1841) in the outlying village of Hildenborough, then part of the parish of St Peter and St Paul—was his first church, and Christian has been praised for his assured handling of Gothic Revival architectural forms. As well as the new St Saviour's and St Stephen's churches, three unparished mission churches were provided for its growing population and were served from them. Two survive, but neither are in religious use and the St Stephen's Mission at Lower Haysden is in ruinous condition. It was a tin tabernacle—a distinctive and cheap type of church building which could be bought from a catalogue and erected quickly where needed. The heyday of tin tabernacles was the turn of the 20th century, and two green-painted examples survive in religious use in the borough: the Golden Green Mission Church (1914) serves a hamlet near Hadlow and has listed building status, and St Andrew's Church a few miles away serves the Hadlow Stair area of Tonbridge.
The 19th-century Anglican churchbuilding boom in Tonbridge was also prompted by the rise in popularity of Protestant Nonconformist worship, legal restrictions on which had been relaxed steadily since the 17th century. Independents founded a chapel in the town in 1791, and by the 1850s there were congregations of Wesleyan Methodists, Congregationalists, Strict Baptists, Independent Calvinistic Baptists and the United Methodist Free Church. In the 20th century, places of worship have been provided for Evangelical, Pentecostal and Brethren worshippers, and the non-denominational River Church was established in 1998 and moved into the new River Centre building next to the Medway in 2003. Long-established Nonconformist chapels elsewhere in the borough include a Reformed Baptist chapel at Ryarsh, an Evangelical Free church at Dunk's Green, a Brethren Gospel Hall in Hildenborough, and Strict Baptist, Salvation Army and Methodist churches in East Peckham. Methodism in particular has thrived in Kent for many years, and several small rural chapels survive in the borough—although postwar decline has resulted in several closures, including the Grade II-listed chapels at Aylesford and Ightham. At Burham, the Methodist chapel took in Anglicans when their 19th-century church was demolished because of structural problems, and continues to serve both denominations. As Roman Catholic worship became more prevalent in the 19th century—again after legal restrictions were removed—churches were built at Tonbridge and West Malling (now replaced by a postwar building), and in the 20th century a badminton hall and a disused Gospel Hall were bought and turned into churches in Borough Green and Hadlow respectively.
Away from Tonbridge town, much of the district is rural and there are many ancient Anglican churches. Some villages, such as Addington, Trottiscliffe and Offham, are a long way from their churches; at East Peckham, the centre of population moved and the distance was so great that St Michael's Church became redundant and a new building was provided close to the village. The small town of Snodland continues to support two active Anglican churches, but Roman Catholic, Methodist, United Reformed and Swedenborgian churches have all closed since the 1970s. The area around the ancient village of Larkfield has developed into a large residential and industrial suburb encompassing New Hythe, Leybourne and Lunsford Park; two Anglican churches already existed to serve the conurbation, but a new Methodist church was provided in 1964, superseding one in nearby East Malling.
Religious affiliation.
According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, 107,561 people lived in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling. Of these, 76.13% identified themselves as Christian, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.16% were Hindu, 0.15% were Buddhist, 0.12% were Jewish, 0.07% were Sikh, 0.24% followed another religion, 15.01% claimed no religious affiliation and 7.83% did not state their religion. The proportion of Christians was much higher than the 71.74% in England as a whole, and the proportion of people with no religious affiliation was slightly higher than the national average of 14.59%. Adherents of Islam, Hinduism, Judaism and Sikhism and Buddhism were much less prevalent in the borough than in England overall: in 2001, 3.1% of people in England were Muslim, 1.11% were Hindu, 0.67% were Sikh, 0.52% were Jewish and 0.28% were Buddhist. The proportion of people who followed religions not mentioned in the Census was slightly lower than the national figure of 0.29%.
Administration.
Anglican churches.
All of Tonbridge and Malling borough's Anglican churches are administered by the Diocese of Rochester, the seat of which is Rochester Cathedral. The diocese has three archdeaconries; these are subdivided into deaneries which each cover a group of churches. The Archdeaconry of Rochester administers three churches in the borough: Snodland's two churches are in the Cobham Deanery, and the chapel at Blue Bell Hill Village is part of the Rochester Deanery. The Archdeaconry of Tonbridge covers the borough's 35 other Anglican churches. The Deanery of Malling administers Addington, Aylesford, Birling, Burham, Ditton, East Malling, Larkfield, Leybourne, Mereworth, Offham, Ryarsh, Trottiscliffe, Wateringbury, West Peckham and Wouldham churches, and both the parish church and the Pilsdon Community Barn Chapel at West Malling. East Peckham, Golden Green and Hadlow churches are part of the Deanery of Paddock Wood. The Deanery of Shoreham is responsible for Borough Green, Fairseat, Ightham, Platt, Plaxtol, Shipbourne, Stansted and Wrotham. The six churches in Tonbridge—St Peter and St Paul's, St Stephen's, St Saviour's, St Eanswythe's Mission, St Philip's at Cage Green and St Andrew's at Hadlow Stair—are within the Deanery of Tonbridge, as is St John the Evangelist's Church at Hildenborough.
Roman Catholic churches.
The borough's four Roman Catholic churches are at Borough Green, Hadlow, Tonbridge and West Malling. All are in the Archdiocese of Southwark, whose seat is St George's Cathedral in Southwark, southeast London. The archdiocese has 20 deaneries, of which seven are in Kent. The Tunbridge Wells Deanery administers three of the churches: Corpus Christi at Tonbridge and its dependent chapel (St Peter's) at Hadlow, and St Joseph's at Borough Green in the four-church Catholic parish of Sevenoaks. St Thomas More's Church at West Malling is in the Maidstone Deanery.
Other denominations.
About 150 Baptist churches in southeast England are part of the South Eastern Baptist Association, which arranges its member congregations into geographical networks. Tonbridge Baptist Church is in the Tonbridge Network, and the North Kent Network administers Walderslade Baptist Church and West Malling Free Church.

St Leonard's Tower.
St Leonard's Tower is a Grade I-listed building in West Malling. Resembling a church tower, it was built as the keep of a castle by Gundulf, the Bishop of Rochester between 1077 and 1108. Described as "remarkably preserved", it has been identified by some sources as the tower of a former church dedicated to St Leonard. The building was apparently demolished to allow its stonework to be used elsewhere, leaving only the tower standing on a rocky outcrop southwest of the town. More recent research casts doubt on this: John Newman, writing in the "Buildings of England" series in 1969, stated that "n 1198 St Leonard's cemetery is mentioned, and there are later references to a chapel. Yet this is no church tower, but a free-standing keep tower". English Heritage, in its assessment of the structure written in 1993, made no reference to any former religious use, instead describing it as a "former castle ... one of the best examples of an early Norman keep".

Peasedown Athletic F.C.

Peasedown Athletic Football Club is an English football club based in Peasedown St John, Somerset. Formerly known as Peasedown St John and Peasedown Miners Welfare, the club has played at Western Football League level, and currently plays in the Somerset County League. As Peasedown Miners Welfare, they featured in the FA Cup during the 1940s and 1950s. The club plays its home games at the Miners Welfare Recreation Ground.
History.
As Peasedown St John, the club played at its highest level when it joined the Western League in 1911 and stayed for three seasons, finishing fifth in 1913–14, the last season before World War I disrupted regular football in England. After the war, Peasedown resumed in Division Two of a restructured Western League, winning promotion to Division One in 1920–21. They managed fifth place in Division One again in 1922–23, but left two years later after a poor season in 1924–25.
The club returned to the Western League in 1939–40 as Peasedown Miners Welfare, securing the highest finish in their history in fourth place, but football was again disrupted, this time by World War II. After the resumption of football in 1945–46 they equalled their best finish of fourth place before a run of poor form resulted in relegation to Division Two in 1950–51. They gradually dropped down this division, and left the league in 1960.
During this post-war period, Peasedown competed in the FA Cup, reaching the Fourth Qualifying Round in 1945–46. They missed out on the First Round Proper after losing a replay 1–0 at home to Cheltenham Town. Entering the competition every season until 1956–57, they never again reached further than the Second Qualifying Round.
Dropping into the Bath and District League during the 1960s and 1970s, the club eventually graduated to the Somerset County League as Peasedown Athletic, finishing runners-up in the Premier Division twice in the mid-1990s. Relegated to Division One in 1999, they achieved promotion in 2001 but were again relegated in 2003, and subsequently dropped to Division Two in 2005. For 2012–13, they are members of Division Two East.

Commonwealth free trade

Commonwealth Free Trade is a concept built around the gradual introduction of a free trade treaty that would include member states of the Commonwealth of Nations.
The idea of promoting inter-Commonwealth trade has emerged in recent years as a response to the current evolution of the global economy. Proponents in Commonwealth jurisdictions promote the idea as a means of diversifying and expanding their own national economies.
The concept has become popularized in Britain among those who are self-styled ‘Eurosceptics’, and wish for the UK to leave the formal political structures of the European Union, to be replaced with a Free Trade Treaty with the EU. But at the moment the UK-Trade relations are not significantly stronger with the countries of the commonwealth. From the Top 10 Commonwealth-Nations, measured by nominal GDP, Britain claim in no single one an import (for Britain an export) share of more than 4%, and only in three countries an export (for Britain an import) share above 4%. Germany for comparison does claim in three countries an import share above 4% (German export), and in three countries an export (German import) share above 4%.
Historical origins.
Throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Britain exercised an informal trade system with her colonies and self-governing dominions.
During the early 20th century, several political figures in Britain, led by Joseph Chamberlain, argued for a policy of Imperial Preference – both to promote unity within the British Empire, and to assure Britain’s position as a world power. The policy was controversial as it pitted proponents of Imperial trade with those who sought a general policy of trade liberalization with all nations.
The schism helped contribute to the defeat of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and his Conservative-Unionist government in 1906, and had serious ramifications for Conservative prospects in the 1923 and 1929 general elections. One notable victory had been the establishment of the Empire Marketing Board in 1926, which encouraged Britons to ‘Buy Empire’.
In 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, representatives of Britain, the Dominions, and the Colonies met in Ottawa, Canada to hold the Commonwealth Conference on Economic Consultation and Co-operation. There had been an initial agreement on Imperial Preference, but a comprehensive agreement failed to materialize. Many of the Dominion leaders attributed this to the attitude of the British Dominions Secretary J. H. Thomas during the negotiations.
In 1935, the Canadian Prime Minister, R. B. Bennett, a Conservative who endorsed Imperial Preference, was replaced by a Liberal, W. L. M. King. King responded to pressure from U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and abandoned Imperial Preference. The United States was determined to maintain its tariff protections and access to markets, but was vociferously opposed to any such preferences enjoyed by other countries.needed
In the case of the Commonwealth, the U.S. was hostile to it from its inception, notwithstanding the fact that in the cases of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, there was an overwhelming preference for a trade system based on the United Kingdom rather than the U.S.needed
The conclusion of World War II drastically affected the prospects for an agreement Commonwealth trade. The United States emerged as the foremost political and economic power, and its policy was to promote generalized free trade, primarily through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Bretton Woods conference, held in New Hampshire in 1944, had also created a direct link between the value of gold and the US dollar, thereby establishing it as the world’s reserve fiat currency.
The war had also left Britain heavily indebted, economically weakened, and unable to absorb the flow of exports from Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Dominions, primarily Canada, directed their trade more heavily to the US market as a consequence.
The idea of enhanced trade between Canada and Britain was explored in the mid-1950s by the Conservative government of Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker. The plan, in response to the Canadian government’s concern with over-reliance on the United States, was to adopt policies that would see up to 15 percent of Canada’s US exports diverted to the UK. Representatives for both Diefenbaker and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan held exploratory talks, but no agreement was ever reached.
UK entry into the EEC.
Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, and its evolution as a member state of the European Union (EU) has meant that for practical purposes, the United Kingdom cannot independently enter into negotiations with Commonwealth states to establish a free trade agreement. Instead, the EU, as a representative of all its members, negotiates collectively.
At present, the Government of Canada is in the midst of negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union. In addition, the EU, through the Lome and Cotonou Agreements, have extended some preferential trade access to developing Commonwealth and Francophonie states.
Present day.
The Commonwealth Effect.
In 1997, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at Edinburgh was presented with research conducted by Drs. Sarianna Lundan and Geoffrey Jones, and commissioned by the Commonwealth Secretariat. The paper, entitled “The ‘Commonwealth Effect’ and the Process of Internationalisation”, measured whether or not Commonwealth jurisdictions enjoyed a qualitative advantage in trade with one another as opposed to equivalent non-Commonwealth nations. Their research found that even in the absence of trade treaties, there was a clear cost advantage in trade between Commonwealth nations, and that the overhead costs of doing business were reduced by up to 15 percent in comparison to trade outside the Commonwealth.
The Case for Commonwealth Free Trade.
In 2005, Canadian writer and political activist Brent H. Cameron published The Case for Commonwealth Free Trade, which re-introduced the idea. Cameron’s argument was that unlike previous attempts, a Commonwealth Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) could work due to particular changes in the global economy and power structures, including: the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet bloc; the rapid development and economic expansion of Commonwealth economies; and the natural trade, commerce and cultural linkages that occurred between Commonwealth states, even without a formal trade treaty.
Cameron cites the work of Lundan and Jones, Katharine West, as well as Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University, who quantified the impact of specific economic, geographic and social attributes to international trade.
The book argues for the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements among Commonwealth countries that would eventually lead to the adoption of a CFTA.
Commonwealth Advantage.
The Commonwealth Advantage program was a shared initiative between the Toronto Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society, and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance (CATA) which ran from 2004 until 2008. Chaired by the Hon. Sinclair Stevens, a former Canadian International Trade Minister, the campaign was focused on developing strategic partnerships between Commonwealth-based companies.
CHOGM 2005 – Malta.
In response to the lack of progress achieved in the Doha round of trade liberalization negotiations in the World Trade Organization, Commonwealth Heads of Government, at their 2005 Summit in Malta, endorsed the idea of pursuing trade agreements among Commonwealth member states.
Commonwealth Free Trade as policy.
Differences between Commonwealth members.
Because of their very different economic profiles Commonwealth countries' interests are not always aligned. In principle, resource exporters such as Canada, Australia, and most of the Caribbean and African Commonwealth countries are complementary to resource importers such as the United Kingdom and India. However, the historical trade ties between them were based on terms which were dictated by the Colonial Office in Britain. Since the former dominions and colonies have achieved independence, they are free to refuse British initiatives and seek better deals elsewhere. Specifically, agricultural exporters in the Cairns Group (including members Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, and South Africa) are at odds with the importing countries at the World Trade Organisation. And of course each of these countries is free to pursue other trade policies. Notably Australia (2005) and Canada (1988), and Singapore (2004) have free trade agreements with the United States, and New Zealand (2008) has one with China. Meanwhile New Zealand and Singapore are already a members of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which Australia, Canada, Malaysia, are attempting to join (along with major non-Commonwealth countries). Furthermore, the proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia would include Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, India, Australia, and New Zealand. Notably, all these proposals exclude the UK, the place where the concept of "Commonwealth free trade" is most popular, since the UK is an EU member states and cannot negotiate independently, which is why the proposal is often tied to Euroskepticism.
Canada.
Commonwealth trade, as such, has not been a notable policy position in Canada since the failed Diefenbaker proposal of the 1950s. Instead Canada has pursued deep economic integration with the United States and on the one hand (including a free trade agreement in 1988), and a generalised diversification of trade on the other hand including the "third option" policy of the 1970 (a failed attempt to diversify Canada's trade via negotiations with Japan and the European Economic Community). This has been reinforced with a new wave of free trade agreements following NAFTA in 1994, including five Latin American countries and the European Free Trade Association, as well the failed Free Trade Area of the Americas in the early 2000s, and negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership since 2012.
, 75% of Canadian trade takes place with countries which Canada has a free trade agreement, but this does not include any Commonwealth members. Canada is currently is in negotiations with the Caribbean Community (primarily Commonwealth countries), the European Union (UK and Cyprus are Commonwealth members), as well as India and Singapore.
United Kingdom.
Although the terms of Britain's membership in the European Union precludes it from unilaterally negotiating for a CFTA, the idea has garnered interest. In particular, those politicians and parties that advocate leaving the European Union cite the development of a Commonwealth Free Trade policy as a first step.
The UK Independence Party has included a call for a Commonwealth Free Trade Agreement in its policy manifesto during the 2010 British General Election. In addition, some members of Britain’s Conservative Party, including MEP Daniel Hannan and MP Andrew Rosindell, have written extensively on the merits of expanding trade within the Commonwealth and the broader Anglosphere.
On October 8, 2012, Tim Hewish and James Styles released their paper "Common Trade, Common Wealth, Common Growth" at the UK Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England. The following day saw British Foreign Secretary William Hague comment upon how the Commonwealth, which had been 'neglected' by previous UK governments, presented "enormous opportunities" for the nation.
Support for Commonwealth Free Trade.
Support for Commonwealth Free Trade is generally greatest among those in support of centre-right political and economic movements. Commonwealth Free Traders are often also supporters of the Anglosphere movement, although many are not, citing a CFTA as a possible ‘counterbalance’ to US hegemony.
In Canada there is little popular feeling for the Commonwealth, and it is not celebrated by the government and commentators have called for the institution to be wound up
Commentators such as James C. Bennett and Brent Cameron have expressed the view that support for either the Anglosphere or the Commonwealth are not incompatible. Cameron has explained that as the Commonwealth forms a unique subset within the Anglosphere, support for either concept is not mutually exclusive, and his work on a CFTA should be seen as promoting economic co-operation among those particular nations.

Anne-Sophie Pic

Anne-Sophie Pic (born 12 July 1969) is a French chef best known for gaining three Michelin stars for her restaurant, Maison Pic, in southeast France. She is the fourth female chef to ever win three Michelin stars, and was named the Best Female Chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2011.
Biography.
Anne-Sophie Pic is the daughter of chef Jacques Pic, and grew up at her family's restaurant, Maison Pic. Her grandfather, Andre Pic, was also a chef, who was particularly known for a crayfish gratin dish, and who first gained the restaurant three Michelin stars in 1934. However she initially decided not to follow in their footsteps, and instead travelled overseas to train in management. She worked in Japan and the United States as an intern for various companies, including Cartier and Moët & Chandon, but found herself drawn back to the restaurant for her "passion".
At the age of 23, in 1992 she returned to Maison Pic to train under her father to become a chef. He died three months later, and she moved to working the front of the house. In 1995, the restaurant lost its third Michelin star, for which she felt she had lost "her father's star", and spurred her to return to the kitchen. In 1997, Pic took control of the restaurant. She had no formal training in cooking.
In 2007, she regained Maison Pic's three Michelin stars. This was only the fourth time anywhere that a female chef had achieved three Michelin stars. That same year, Pic was the only woman on French newspaper "Le Figaro"s list of the top twenty richest chefs in France.
She opened her second restaurant, Restaurant Anne-Sophie Pic, in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and is located within the Beau-Rivage Palace hotel. In September 2012, she is scheduled to open her first Paris-based restaurant, La Dame de Pic.
Pic is married to David Sinapian and has a son named Nathan.
Awards.
In 2011, she received the Veuve Clicquot World’s Best Female Chef award, named after Madame Clicquot Ponsardin and given by the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards scheme from British magazine "Restaurant". It was the first time the category had been awarded, and it was thought to have been closely fought between Pic, Elena Arzak and Nadia Santini. At the time of the award, Pic was the only three Michelin starred female chef in France.
On 14 July 2011, she was named a Chevalier (Knight) of the French Legion of Honour.

Constance Kgosiemang

Constance Letang Kgosiemang (5 April 1946 – 16 August 2012) was the paramount chief of the Tswana people in Namibia, a parliamentarian, and the leader of the Seoposengwe Party until its merger into the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA).
Kgosiemang was born on 5 August 1946 in Aminuis. He was related to chief Morwe, the Tswana leader from Kuruman (South Africa) who founded the Tswana minority in South-West Africa. Kgosiemang became chief of this group in 1979. In this position he also led the "Tswana Alliance", a group participating at the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference in Windhoek between 1975 and 1977. He oversaw the name change from "Tswana Alliance" to "Seoposengwe Party" and its fusion into the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance in 1980.
When the apartheid government of South Africa devised the Odendaal Plan in the 1960s, Tswanaland was one of the planned bantustans, intended to be a self-governing homeland for the Tswana people. Unlike all other homelands, it was never implemented that way. The Ovaherero were allowed to stay in the area, and the Tswana remained a minority. Kgosimang was the political leader of this entity between 1980 and 1989.
In the twilight days of South-West Africa, Kgosiemang was a member of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, and after Namibian independence he became a member of Namibia's first parliament. He served until 1993, when pressure from his Tswana community forced him to resign and concentrate on his duties as traditional leader. He later joined ruling SWAPO but never returned to the National Assembly. Constance Kgosiemang died of a heart attack on 16 August 2012.

Pill Priory

Pill Priory is a Tironian house founded near Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, South West Wales in the late 12th century.
Pill Priory was founded as a daughter house of St Dogmaels Abbey (raised to Abbey status in 1120), near Cardigan, itself a priory of the Tironian order of reformed Benedictine monks. The other daughter houses were Caldey (Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire, Wales) and Glascarrig, County Wexford in Ireland.
Pill Priory was established by the Roche family of the Barony and Roch Castle, Pembrokeshire and was founded within a few years of St Dogmaels. The founder was Adam de la Roche, a descendant of Godebert de Fleming. E.M. Pritchard thought it to be around 1180-90, while the Pembrokeshire antiquarian Richard Fenton considered the earlier date of 1160-70 to be possible.
The priory was jointly dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to St Budoc, a dedication of it was the former chapel of St Budoc (now "St Botolph") which lay 1.3 km north-east of Pill Priory.
The community may always have been small; it was recorded as five monks in 1534 and four in 1536.
The priory site and its environs, including five orchards, a wood and a meadow at Pill, the priory mill and several other possessions including St Budoc's and Steynton Church were demised by the crown to John Doune who, in 1544, confirmed the grant of his interest to John Wogan who in turn had been the lessee of the "Priory" in 1536-7.
In 1536 St Dogmaels Abbey and its daughters at Pill and Caldey were dissolved in the suppression of those monastic houses with values of less than £200 and fell to the crown. The Valor Ecclesiasticus recorded that Pill Priory was worth annually £67 15s. 3d. gross, £52 2S. 5d. net after charges. The manor of Pill, including the priory site and associated holdings, was sold in June 1546 to the aspiring local landowners Roger Barlow of Slebech and his brother Thomas.
An account of Pill Priory by the Pembrokeshire antiquarian Richard Fenton, writing c. 1811, describes the priory ruins much as they survive today.
The entire site remains in private hands. The free-standing remains of the priory church's chancel arch is now the most striking element of the site, and forms a garden feature, together with the remains of the south transept. The Pill Priory Cottage living quarters contain elements from the conventual buildings which were arranged around a more-or-less formalised cloister. The remains of all are construcled from Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone, both from local sources.
The chancel arch and south transept are designated as scheduled monuments by Cadw (the Welsh Government historic environment service). The living quarters are listed as Grade II*.

Progressive illumination

Progressive illumination is a theological concept describing the hermeneutical practice of orthodox theological development, most notably in Christianity; though the practice exists in many religions, especially Abrahamic religions. The term is used mostly among Christian theologians. It is distinct from progressive revelation in that it does not describe the reception from God of new divine texts, or any novel concept that has no accepted foundation. Rather it describes God-given understanding of existing revelation in a better and more accurate way. It usually refers to understanding a biblical concept better, but the term also encompasses understanding creation better, even through scientific inquiry.

Multiplicity (psychology)

Multiplicity is the use of multiple personality styles by a person. Personality style has been defined as "an individual's relatively consistent inclinations and preferences across contexts." 
However, Stephen Braude and Rita Carter have a different definition of personality style, defining "personality style" as "personality" and proposing that a person may have multiple selfs and not have any relatively consistent inclinations and preferences in personality. This may happen as an adaptation to a change of environment and role within a person's life and may be consciously adopted or encouraged, in a similar way to acting or role-playing. For example, a woman may adopt a kind, nurturing personality when dealing with her children but change to a more aggressive, forceful personality when going to work as a high-flying executive as her responsibilities change. 
Jung proposed: "The many "contains" the unity of the one "without losing" the possibilities of the many." That is, personalities don't exist, only personifications. 
When adoption of multiple personalities becomes disabling or unhealthy, it may be known as dissociative identity disorder, but the extent to which this is a distinct medical condition is disputed. 
Authors who have developed the idea that multiple personality is normal rather than pathological include Adam Crabtree ("Multiple Man: Explorations in Possession and Multiple Personality (1985)") and John Rowan ("Subpersonalities: the people inside us" (1990)).

South Fork Salmon River

The South Fork Salmon River is a tributary of the Salmon River in Idaho and Valley Counties in central Idaho. The river drains a rugged, lightly populated wilderness watershed in the Salmon River Mountains. It is the second largest tributary of the Salmon River, after the Middle Fork.
Geography.
Beginning near Monumental Peak in the Boise National Forest, the river flows generally north to its confluence with the Salmon near Mackay Bar, about above the larger river's mouth on the Snake River. About midway along its course, it is joined by its two main tributaries – the East Fork South Fork Salmon River from the east, and the Secesh River from the west. The river receives runoff from a total of of land, ranging in elevation from at North Loon Mountain to at the mouth of the river.
History.
The Native Americans living along the river were the Nez Perce, Shoshone, Bannock and Paiute. The river and its valley were used largely as a place for fishing, hunting and gathering, while local hot springs provided camping sites during the winter.
The first recorded Europeans to see the South Fork may have been a group of mountain men working under the American Fur Company in 1831. They crossed the upper part of the river while reconnoitering the western part of the Salmon River system for good beaver streams. In the 1860s, prospectors discovered gold on the South Fork, leading to the initial settlement of the drainage by Westerners. After the gold rush faded, a few of the miners stayed on as homesteaders and ranchers.
The drainage was heavily logged from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, when an estimated 320 million board feet of timber was taken from the basin. More than of logging roads were constructed across the drainage.
Ecology.
The South Fork is an important habitat for Chinook salmon, Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout and steelhead trout and has been designated a critical habitat for salmon. Although aquatic habitat in the South Fork drainage is considered good as a whole, some tributaries have been damaged by logging, mining and road-building activities, which has increased the sediment load in the river. About of backcountry roads in the drainage have been decommissioned and are undergoing restoration by the U.S. Forest Service.
Plant communities in the South Fork drainage range from grassland and shrubland, Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and Grand fir forests at lower elevations, to subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, whitebark pine and aspen at mid to high elevations. Among large mammals, the watershed is home to Rocky Mountain elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, black bear, cougar, mountain goat, bighorn sheep and gray wolf. The area has over 200 confirmed species of resident and migratory birds.
Hydrology.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated a stream gage at the mouth of the South Fork between 1993 and 2003, recording an annual mean of . The highest annual mean was in 1997, and the lowest was in 2001. Mean monthly discharge rates for the South Fork are displayed in the below graph.
Monthly discharges at Mackay Bar (cfs)<br>
Recreation.
Although not as frequently run as the Middle Fork, the South Fork is also well known for challenging whitewater. Boaters frequently put in at the Secesh River, about above the mouth of the South Fork on the main stem Salmon. Because of their relatively pristine condition, the South Fork and its tributary the Secesh are being considered for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system.

<doc id="36749242" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36749242" title="Vocabulary mismatch">
Vocabulary mismatch

Vocabulary mismatch is a common phenomenon in the usage of natural languages, occurring when different people name the same thing or concept differently.
Furnas et al. (1987) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem. Their results show that on average 80% of the times different people (experts in the same field) will name the same thing differently. There are usually tens of possible names that can be attributed to the same thing. This research motivated the work on latent semantic indexing.
The vocabulary mismatch between user created queries and relevant documents in a corpus causes the term mismatch problem in information retrieval. Zhao and Callan (2010) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem in a retrieval setting. Their results show that an average query term fails to appear in 30-40% of the documents that are relevant to the user query. They also showed that this probability of mismatch is a central probability in one of the fundamental probabilistic retrieval models, the Binary Independence Model. They developed novel term weight prediction methods that can lead to potentially 50-80% accuracy gains in retrieval over strong keyword retrieval models. Further research along the line shows that expert users can use Boolean Conjunctive Normal Form expansion to improve retrieval performance by 50-300% over unexpanded keyword queries.
Techniques that solve mismatch.
Zhao provided a survey of common techniques that can solve mismatch in the dissertation on term mismatch.
Query expansion.
A recent study by Zhao and Callan (2012) using expert created manual Conjunctive normal form queries has shown that searchonym expansion in the Boolean conjunctive normal form is much more effective than the traditional bag of word expansion e.g. Rocchio expansion.
A wiki website called WikiQuery has been developed by one of the authors of the above study, which helps users create, store and share effective Conjunctive normal form queries.

Parkanaur House

Parkanaur House is a Class A listed large Tudor Revival style house in the village of Castlecaulfield near Dungannon, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. 
The present house is a two-storey building constructed in the 1840s from block rubble. It has a terraced front with octagonal pinnacles and gables at each projection of the façade, a big bay window and an upper oriel and incorporates an earlier two storey building as an east wing. At the rear is a coach house and free-standing office block. 
History.
Land previously owned by the O'Donnelly family was granted by James I to Sir Toby Caulfield in the early 1600s and remained in the possession of the family until sold to Ynyr Burges in 1771. His descendants built a two-storey cottage on the estate which they called Edenfield. In the 1820s John Henry Burges moved in and enlarged the cottage, and his son John Ynyr Burges commissioned architect Thomas Duff to design a new mansion, which was built between 1839 and 1854, which he renamed Parkanaur.
The house remained in the Burges family until they moved to England in 1955. It was then bought by American millionaire Thomas Doran who had emigrated from Castlecaulfield as a teenager. He made the property available to his friend Rev Gerry Eakins to develop a new centre for the education of handicapped young adults. The house reopened in 1960 as 'The Thomas Doran Training Centre', (Parkanaur College) and much of the house continues today in this role.
The grounds were opened to the public as Parkanaur Forest Park in 1983. They contain a rare herd of white fallow deer.

South Fork Clearwater River

The South Fork Clearwater River is a long river in north-central Idaho in the United States. Draining about , the South Fork joins with the Middle Fork Clearwater River to form the Clearwater River, a major tributary of the Snake River.
The river is formed by the confluence of the American River and Red River in the Nez Perce National Forest at an elevation of . The roughly American River rises at and flows generally south to the confluence, while the northwest flowing Red River, rising at , is about long. The American River is sometimes considered part of the main stem. From the confluence the South Fork flows west through a canyon followed by Idaho State Highway 14, receiving the Crooked River from the left and Newsome Creek from the right before reaching Golden, where it receives Tenmile Creek from the left. Further west the river receives Johns Creek from the left, Meadow Creek from the right and Mill Creek from the left, and the gorge deepens to a maximum of some as the river swings north near Grangeville. From there the river flows generally north, past Harpster and Stites, before reaching its mouth on the Clearwater at Kooskia, at an elevation of .
Grangeville (Harpster) Dam was built on the South Fork in 1910 for hydroelectricity generation. In 1963, the dam was demolished, restoring the river's populations of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. Today, the entire South Fork and its headwater tributaries are free flowing and unobstructed by dams or major diversions.

Ari Wallach

Ari Wallach (born 1974) is Founder and CEO of Synthesis Corp., a social innovation consultancy. The firm was founded in 2008, and has since counted the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, the Ford Foundation, CNN, Sephora, Volkswagen, and US State Department amongst its clients.
Tech President called Ari “one of the most creative online innovators working in the political space today” in recognition of his work on BillBabyBill, a project to bring a comprehensive energy bill to the floor of the Senate. His speaking on social technology has been featured at South by Southwest, the 92nd St. Y, fora.tv, and at the AYM summits in London and Mexico City.
Ari is considered an expert in the usage of technology to further innovation in seemingly calcified sectors and was asked to give a series of talks on “Democracy 2.0” on behalf of the US State Department at various cities and consulates in Japan in 2010. In 2011 Ari spoke at the annual Auburn Rudin lecture at WNYC on the impact the Internet is having on societies mental maps and structural models in regards to the future of faith and spirituality.
He has been written about in numerous publications including The "San Francisco Chronicle", "Fast Company", "The New York Times", and "The Guardian".
Ari currently sits on the boards of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, blankonblank.org, Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life.
Early life.
Ari was born in Guadalajara, Mexico where his father, a Polish Holocaust survivor and member of the Jewish underground in World War II, established a successful industrial infrastructure business after an 11 year stint in Cuba pre and post-revolution. Eventually, the family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where Ari was raised.
Ari’s mother is a Bay Area artist who most recently was included in a Marc Chagall retrospective. Regarding the passing of Ari’s father in 1993, Sen. Harry Reid declared “Recently our Nation lost a national treasure… His family's loss was ours. There is one fewer just man to stand and tell the truth. One fewer just man to bear witness. We who are living must remember him and what by living he taught us. We must, we shall, never forget.”
Education and Career.
Ari majored in Peace and Conflict Studies at UC Berkeley. He brings his conflict resolution experience to bear in his work in innovation. Says Ari: “The heart of innovation is conflict—you are challenging the status quo.” 
Ari’s career has followed a path, ranging from work in media, government, and various creative fields. Early in his career, Ari worked with the Democratic National Committee, Clinton/Gore 96, and the US Institute of Peace, all in Washington, DC.
A seminal moment came during Ari’s Fellowship with the Coro Foundation in New York City—a leadership training program based on the medical rotation model. Ari says that Coro “really laid the groundwork for the business model of Synthesis”.
Ari went on to become the Founder of re:think media, a cross-platform producer of public affairs content, and Founding Director of INFORUM—one of the nation´s largest non-partisan public affairs forums for young people. He also served as Vice President of Seed Media Group from 2006-2008.
In 2008, Ari founded The Great Schlep — the viral GOTV campaign that mobilized young Jewish voters for Obama in 2008. The Great Schlep received over 342 million global media impressions and activated over 25,000 volunteers.
Synthesis Corp..
Ari founded Synthesis Corp. in 2008 in order to assist governments, NGOs, foundations, and corporations at the C-suite level to discover new ways to drive sustainable innovation, rethink business models and improve top-line metrics. 
As Founder and CEO of Synthesis Corp., Ari was instrumental in helping the US State Department launch Opinion Space—a web application that solicits views and input on US foreign policy.
Synthesis is currently working with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to develop UNHCR labs—whose mission will be to drive innovation both inside and outside of UNHCR to further their collective ability to serve persons of concern worldwide with the latest tools, platforms and processes.
In November 2012, Ari was invited to attend the GovLab Summit at 10 Downing Street on the topic of the future of governance, data and democracy. There he spoke on social paradigm shifts and the need for collective and participatory vision - “People want to see how they’re involved in where things are going. Shifts only occur when people have an idea of where they’re going."
Ari was a delegate to the Academy of Achievement as a result of his work in social innovation with Synthesis.
Family.
Ari is married to Sharon Wallach. They have two daughters who, as the New York Times recently noted, are only allowed to read printed books.

Lithuanian nuclear power referendum, 2012

An advisory referendum on the construction of a new nuclear power station was held in Lithuania on 14 October 2012, alongside parliamentary elections. The proposal was rejected by 65% of voters.
Background.
The Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, being of a similar design to the Chernobyl plant, was considered too dangerous by the European Commission and it was closed in 2009, as part of a deal agreed when Lithuania joined the EU in 2004. A referendum in 2008 had seen a large majority (89%) vote in favour of keeping the plant open, but the low turnout of 48% (with the threshold set at 50%) invalidated the result. After closing the Ignalina plant, the country became dependent on energy supplies from neighbouring Russia. Plans to build a new 1,350MW nuclear power plant at Visaginas by 2020–2022 were subsequently developed by the Lithuanian government together with Latvia, Estonia and the Japanese company Hitachi. Lithuania would own 38% of the plant, Estonia 22%, Latvia 20% and Hitachi 20%. 
On 16 July the Seimas made a decision to hold an advisory referendum on the construction of the new plant by a vote of 62–39. The proposal to hold a referendum was opposed by the ruling Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats, which accused opposition parties of seeking to make political capital out of the issue prior to the elections. Former President Valdas Adamkus described the decision to hold the referendum as "nonsense," asking "What if the nation decides against, and the government decides to build it?

Alberto Beltrán

Alberto Beltrán García (born March 22, 1923, Mexico City, d. April 19, 2002, Mexico City) was a Mexican graphic artist and painter known principally for his work with publications such as illustrations and political cartoons but he created a number of murals as well. He was born in the rough neighborhood of Tepito and began drawing for local publishers when he was a teenager. He attended the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas where one of his teachers introduced him to the Taller de Gráfica Popular where he began his career in earnest. From the late 1940s until his death, he work with various publications, mostly newspapers, but he also did book illustrations as well. In his later career, he worked on a number of murals, especially in the state of Veracruz, which he had an affinity for. Despite winning a number of important awards for his work, he is relatively unknown even in Mexico, with collections of his work scattered among a number of institutions.
Life.
Alberto Beltrán García was born on March 22, 1923, in the rough Tepito neighborhood of Mexico City to Hesiquio Beltrán Franco and Josefina García.
As his family was poor, he only completed primary school before working. In 1939, while still a teenager, he entered the Escuela Libre de Arte y Publicidad to study drawing and soon after was drawing illustrations for several local publishers. In 1943, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas where he learning basic engraving with Carlos Alvarado Lang and fresco painting with Alfredo Zalce. However, much of his ability was self-taught, for example the ability to engrave on linoleum.
During his lifetime he was solitary and never had children. He was described as shy, simple and prudent who did not like to be the center of attention. He had a particular affinity for the state of Veracruz, considering himself one at heart, prompting him to work on many artistic and other projects in Xalapa, the city of Veracruz and San Andrés Tuxtla. As a member of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, he believed that artists should work for the people rather than for themselves. He never sold any of his engravings and did not always charge for his book illustration work. He lived simply and saved much of the money he earned or won through prizes without ever spending it.
Near the end of his life, he lived at the Club de Periodistas, a home for aging journalists. He wanted to form a fund for the education of artists with his considerable saving, but legal and economic problems eventually made this impossible. He died at age eighty from complications due to a brain hemorrhage on April 19, 2002.
Career.
Beltrán was one of the most prolific, versatile and successful graphic artists in Mexico in the 20th century, as an illustrator, cartoonist, designer, founder of newspaper and magazines and engraver. He work was added to that of poets, novelists, historians, anthropologists, economists and politicians.
His career began in earnest when he joined the Taller de Gráfica Popular in 1944. He was introduced to the organization by Alfredo Zalce. There he created engravings with themes nationalism, the Mexican Revolution, social criticism and peace working with artists such as Leopoldo Méndez, Pablo O'Higgins, Adolfo Mexiac, Fanny Rabel, José Chávez Morado, Celia Calderón, Elizabeth Catlett, Andrea Gómez and Mariana Yampolsky. He remained with the organization until 1959, serving as its president several times.
In the late 1940s, he began doing political cartoons and illustrations for leading newspapers in Mexico City and other parts of the country, appearing regularly in Excélsior, Novedades de México, Diario de la tarde and La Prensa . He traveled to inner cities and mountainous rural areas doing work as a reporter, generally telling his stories with graphics, which reflected what he saw. He was founder or co-founder of several publications. One of these was El Popular with Alejandro Carrillo Marcor, since stopped publishing. In the 1970s he was one of the founders of the daily El Día, creating its cultural supplement called El Gallo Ilustrado, which he directed. In 1976 he worked with a children’s magazine called Caminito. Near the end of his life, he also worked on a publication called Agua-Cero published by the Pascual Cooperative. He worked right up until his death, despite his frail health, serving on the editorial board and was one of its most active collaborators. His offices there were used for his funeral in accordance to his wishes.
His newspaper and book work became so popular that is was credited with propping up a struggling Mexican publishing industry. Books which feature his work include "Origen, vida y milagros de su apellido" by Gutierre Tibón (1946), "Juan Pérez Jolote: Biographía de un Tzotzil" by Ricardo Pozas Arciniega (1948), "La ruta de Hernán Cortés" by Fernando Benítez (1950), "Dona Bárbara" by Rómulo Gallegos (1954), "La visión de los vencidos" by Miguel León-Portilla (1959), and "Las Tierras flacas" by Agustín Yáñez (1968). He also did the illustration for "Todo empezó el domingo" by Elena Poniatowska.
Beltrán also worked in education, starting with his participation in literacy campaigns, often in indigenous languages. He also worked in political campaigns to promote nationalism and leftist ideals. He collaborated with the Secretaría de Educación Pública to produce textbooks and other educational materials in Spanish and other languages. In 1960 he worked with Revista Magisterio, a magazine dedicated to education. He was also the director of the Escuela Libre de Arte y Publicidad, which he had attended as a teenager.
In his later career, he also did painting and sculpture. One early piece is a relief in the upper part of the Pulmonology Institute of the Centro Médico Siglo XXI in 1959 collaborating with Francisco Zúñiga. In 1967 he created the mural "Quetzalcóatl y el hombre hoy" done in mosaic tile, snail shells and ceramics for the exterior of the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa, Veracruz. This was later moved to the campus of the Universidad Veracruzana in the same city. In 1969 he created a mosaic mural on the vault of the Museum of the City of Veracruz. In 1972 he did a monumental glass piece for the Civil Registry of Veracruz. In 1988, he painted a mural in acrylic for the Attorney General’s office in Mexico City.
One other late project was the creation of the Centro de Información y Documentación Alberto Beltrán, created in 1971 with the collaboration of the Dirección General de Arte Popular and the Secretaría de Educación Pública. It is a unique institution dedicated to the study, promotion and protection of Mexico’s many subcultures. It produces books, pamphlets, newsletters, field notes and various other documents which are contained in its Archivo de la Traditiones y Arte Popular. This center is now part of the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares.
Recognition for his work includes Premio de Carteles de Alfabetización in 1953 (for his work in literacy), the National Engraving Prize in 1956, the first prize at the InterAmerican Biennial in Painting and Engraving in 1958, the National Journalism Prize in 1976 (for his political cartoons), third place in the Satire for Peace Contest in the former Soviet Union in 1984, Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1985. Memberships include the Academia de Artes from 1966, the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, Seminario de Cultura Mexicana from 1980 and Creator Emertitus with the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte from 1993. In 2005, the Dirección General de Culturas Populares e Indígenas published a book about him called Apuntes, retratos y testimonios de un artista inolvidable. Homenaje a Alberto Beltrán.
However, despite the awards he is relatively unknown, even in Mexico. One of his drawings, that of Benito Juárez entering Mexico City, was exhibited for decades in the Zocalo metro station as a mural, but misattributed to “an unknown artist of the last (19th) century.” Beltrán comment this was that he wished he had lived in the 19th century instead of the 20th.
In the last year of his life, there were three exhibitions of his life’s work to honor him but much of it was exhibited as copies as the originals were lost and many of the originals were in poor condition. It is not known exactly how many works he created during his lifetime or where those that still exist are. However, those works which have been authenticated are valuable. A large quantity of his work, probable the largest collection of his to exist, was donated by the artists to UNAM, which the university edited into a book in 2003 called "Alberto Beltrán, 1923-2002 Cronista e Ilustrador". The book also included essays by Vicente Quitarte, Ernesto de la Torre Villar, Silvia González and Elena Poniatowska. Other important collections include the archives of the Taller de Gráfica popular (including original engraving plates), the Museo de la Caricatura in Mexico City, the Centro de Información y Documentación (mostly drawings of indigenous and popular culture) and at the Universidad Obrera de México (mostly politically themed work).
Artistry.
He was a noted painter, engraver and political cartoonist, with most of his notable work in the graphic arts. He is considered to be the successor of José Guadalupe Posada and Leopoldo Méndez.
Most of his work was related to publications. He was a political cartoonist, with emphasis on pointing out the excesses of those in power and the vices of society. He was also a journalist with his reporting mostly done with his graphic work, depicting what he saw without romanticizing. He's considered to be part of the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura, with his work featuring realistic and detailed facial expressions, which often told much of the story. For book illustration, he principally used three techniques, woodcut, metal engraving and lithography. His accurate portrayals of indigenous life came from his frequent travels to rural areas in various parts of Mexico. These were used to illustrate publications such as literature published by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista and a book called Relatos, mitos y leyendas de la Chinantla by Roberto Weitlaner. The book Los mexicanos se pintan solos by Ricardo Cortés Tamayo features images by him illustrating various scenes featuring the common people of the country in the 1950s and 1960s.
His work with the Taller de Gráfica Popular focused on anti-US imperialism, Nazism, fascism and Francoist Spain. It supported various social and civic movements in Mexico, especially those related to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution and those related to workers. He often drew depictions of common men such as street vendors, cooks, bakers, police and many others along with symbols such as the nopal cactus, maguey, huaraches, machetes, sombreros and sarapes. From his time at the Taller, he believed that art was for the masses not his personal enrichment or fame. He signed his work “beltran” without a capital letter or accent mark.

Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra

The Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra is a symphony orchestra based in Portland, Oregon, founded in 1982 as the Palatine Hill Symphony by Jerry Luedders. Then director of the school of music at Lewis & Clark College and conductor of the school's orchestra, Luedders formed the ensemble by recruiting the "best" players from several community orchestras. Rehearsals were originally held at Evans Auditorium on the campus of Lewis & Clark. Luedders served as conductor and music director until 1986.
John Trudeau, then a teacher at Portland State University, became conductor and music director in 1986. The Palatine Hill Symphony was renamed the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra when rehearsals were moved from Lewis & Clark College. Trudeau served as conductor and music director for fourteen years, ending in 2000. Huw Edwards held the position for twelve years, from 2000 to 2012.
History.
Jerry Luedders (1983–1986).
Jerry Luedders founded the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra in 1982 as the Palatine Hill Symphony. Luedders, who had moved to Portland in 1977, was then serving as director of the school of music at Lewis & Clark College and conductor of the school's orchestra. He later recalled of the Palatine Hill Symphony's origins that Portland had several "average" community orchestras at the time, but the "best" players from each agreed to join his orchestra while continuing to perform with their respective ensembles. Orchestra rehearsals were held at Evans Auditorium on the campus of Lewis & Clark. The orchestra's first concert was presented in February 1983 and included Johannes Brahms' Tragic Overture. Luedders served as conductor and music director until the summer of 1986. He later returned to conduct the orchestra in celebration of its twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversaries.
John Trudeau (1986–2000).
John Trudeau, a teacher at Portland State University, became conductor and music director in 1986. When rehearsals were moved from Lewis & Clark, the Palatine Hill Symphony was renamed the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's first performance under the conduction of Trudeau included Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23. Trudeau served as conductor and music director for fourteen years, from 1986 to 2000.
Huw Edwards (2000–2012).
Huw Edwards began serving as conductor and music director in 2000.
In March 2012, to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary, the orchestra presented a pair of concerts conducted in part by Luedders. Performances were held at First United Methodist Church in Portland and Good Shepherd Community Church in Boring; repertoire included Brahms' Tragic Overture (guest conducted by Luedders, the first piece he conducted with the Palatine Hill Symphony), Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 9 (works performed during the first performance conducted by Trudeau), and Ferdinand Hérold's overture to the opéra comique "Zampa" (the first piece Edwards conducted with the orchestra). In April 2012 Edwards announced his resignation at the end of his twelfth season, citing exhaustion from the commutes between Olympia and Portland as the reason. The orchestra's final performances under Edwards' leadership were held in May 2012 at First United Methodist Church in Portland and the Mt. Hood Community College Theatre in Gresham. Edwards was named Conductor Emeritus and Principal Guest Conductor and is scheduled to return for the 2012–2013 season finale concert.
The orchestra anticipates hiring guest conductors for the remainder of the 2012–2013 season as well as the 2013–2014 season as the search continues for its next music director.

<doc id="36749530" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36749530" title="Fort de Maizeret">
Fort de Maizeret

The Fort de Maizeret is one of nine forts built as part of the Fortifications of Namur in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1888 and 1892 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Maizeret was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Namur in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. The fort is now abandoned on private property.
Description.
The Fort de Maizeret is located about east of the center of Namur. The fort, one of the smaller Brialmont forts, is an irregular trapezoid overlooking a bend in the Meuse. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif, closely grouped in a solid mass of concrete. 
Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Namur), with lesser protection than the front and "salient" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear. The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21cm. The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used . Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.
Construction.
The three forts on the right bank of the Meuse were linked by a military railway, with a repair shop for the rolling stock at Maizeret. Materials delivered from the Meuse were moved to Maizeret by an inclined plane from the river below. 
Armament.
Maizeret's guns included one twin 15cm turret, one single 21cm turret and two twin 12cm turrets, all for distant targets. Three 57mm turrets with another six 57mm guns in embrasures providing defense of the fort's ditches and postern. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight.
The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.
World War I.
In the summer of 1914 the Fort de Maizeret was under the command of Captain-Commandant Poncelet, with about 400 men. The fort was bombarded by invading German forces beginning on 21 August 1914. The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Maizeret was abandoned by Poncelet and his garrison on 22 August, its ability to resist destroyed by the heavy German artillery.
Fortified Position of Namur.
Maizeret's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Namur, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border. Protection was substantially increased and armament was modernized. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. The area surrounding the fort was equipped with improved shelters for the interval troops. 
After its renovation, Maizeret was armed with one twin 105mm turret, four 75mm single turrets, one twin machine gun turret and two twin grenade launcher turrets. Machine guns provided close protection. Ventilation was provided by an air inlet in a nearby ravine. The 75mm turrets could be lowered for better protection. 
Second World War.
The Fort de Maizeret in May 1940 was commanded by Captain-Commandant Hambrenne. The fort opened fire against distant targets on 14 May. On the 15th Maizeret fired in support of the Fort de Marchovelette, but was inactive on the following two days. On the 18thy Maizeret again supported Marchovelette. On the 19th there were skirmishes and two wounded Germans were captured. In the 20th, Maizeret supported the Fort d'Andoy. Sporadic action continued on the 21st and 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd the fort came under heavy fire from 88mm high-velocity guns, followed by an infantry assault. The fort surrendered at 1445 hours, having lost all means of resistance.
Present.
The Fort de Maizeret is on private property and is not open to the public. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II. A quarry has been excavated just to the east of the fort. One of the counterscarp positions is directly on the edge of the quarry, overlooking the Meuse. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II. The present owner lives in the former commandant's house.

Bonny Dam

Bonny Dam (National ID # CO01300) is a dam in Yuma County, Colorado, in the eastern part of the state.
The earthen dam was constructed between 1948 and 1951 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, with a height of 158 feet and 9200 feet long at its crest. It impounds the South Fork of the Republican River for flood control, irrigation storage and recreation, as part of the Bureau's extensive Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The dam is owned and operated by the Bureau.
The reservoir it creates, Bonny Reservoir, was drained in 2011. It formerly had a water surface area of over 2000 acres, a maximum capacity of 170,160 acre-feet, and a shoreline of about 15 miles. All water was released downstream to flow across the Kansas state border, about six miles to the east, to satisfy a May 2003 United States Supreme Court decision on a dispute arising from the Republican River Compact.
In September and October 2011, Bonny Lake was drained and many of the park's services were eliminated, including the fishery and the visitors' center. The dam structure remains. The park is now being operated as part of the South Republican River State Wildlife Area.

German submarine U-313

German submarine "U-313" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 11 May 1941 at the "Flender Werke" yard at Lübeck as 'werk' 313, launched on 27 March 1943 and commissioned on 20 May under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Friedrich Schweiger.
During her career, the U-boat sailed on 12 combat patrols, but sank no ships before she surrendered at Narvik in May 1945. She was sunk in December as part of Operation "Deadlight".
She was a member of 11 wolfpacks.
Service history.
The boat's service life began with training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla in May 1943. She was transferred to the 11th flotilla for operations on 1 January 1944. She was then reassigned to the 13th flotilla on 15 September.
She made a pair of short voyages from Kiel in Germany to Stavanger and Bergen in Norway in January 1944.
1st, 2nd and 3rd patrols.
The submarine's first patrol began with her departure from Bergen on 26 January 1944. She arrived at Hammerfest on 2 February but departed again on the 7th. She finished the patrol at Hammerfest on the 29th.
"U-313" spent her second and third patrols in the Norwegian Sea.
4th, 5th, 6th and 7th patrols.
Her fourth sortie took her as far as a point southwest of Bear Island. On 26 June 1944, she was north of Jan Mayen Island.
The boat's fifth patrol kept her closer to the Norwegian coast.
Her sixth and seventh patrols saw the submarine docking in Skillefjord on 23 September 1944, having left Narvik on the 20th. She then left the smaller port on the 26th and returned to Narvik.
8th, 9th and 10th patrols.
For her eighth sortie, she rounded the North Cape, passing Murmansk.
Her ninth patrol was relatively short, beginning in Bodenbucht on 11 December 1944, (northwest of Narvik) and terminating in Trondheim on the 16th.
If her previous patrol was brief, her tenth effort, at 57 days, was her longest and involved sailing near to the Orkney Islands. Having departed Trondheim, the boat returned to Narvik.
11th and 12th patrols and fate.
Having used Harstad (northwest of Narvik) briefly and following the German capitulation, "U-313" was moved, first from Narvik to Skjomenfjord, then to Loch Eriboll in Scotland on 19 May 1945 in preparation for Operation "Deadlight". She was finally transferred to Loch Ryan and sunk on 27 November. According to one source, she capsized while under tow by HMS "Blencathra.

McAree began his playing career as a trainee with Liverpool. He then spent a season with Bristol City, before joining Fulham, then in the Football League Third Division. McAree spent four largely uneventful seasons with Fulham, but scored a vital winning goal in the final minute against Carlisle United, which eventually led to Fulham's promotion. Despite only playing a handful of games, McAree became a cult hero, and is name is still occasionally sung by Fulham fans.
In 2000, McAree returned to Northern Ireland, signing for Glenavon making 33 league appearances and scoring 3 goals. In 2002, he joined his hometown club, Dungannon Swifts, who were then managed by his father Joe, who later became chairman. McAree was a vital player for the Swifts, although occasionally suffered from injury problems. He captained Dungannon to promotion to the Irish Premier League in 2003, where they have remained since. He also won the Ulster Cup and Mid-Ulster Cup with the side. In 2007, he led Dungannon out in the Irish Cup final against Linfield, scoring an equaliser in the 40th minute. However, the Swifts became the first ever side to lose an Irish Cup Final on penalties when after a 2-2 scoreline, Linfield were victorious 3-2 in the shootout. McAree converted his penalty in the shootout. McAree retired from playing after a 2-1 defeat to Coleraine on 24 October 2009, but remained at the club in his capacity as first-team coach.
Coaching career.
McAree combined playing with Dungannon Swifts with coaching the first team. In December 2011 McAree was appointed as Dungannon's new manager following the departure of Dixie Robinson. However he stepped down a couple of months later after it was revealed he did not possess the necessary coaching badges. He was replaced by Darren Murphy, and became his assistant manager. Upon receiving his coaching qualifications, McAree was appointed as joint manager alongside Murphy, before stepping down from the role in October 2012, citing 'personal reasons'. He returned to the club as first team coach in July 2013.

Matroid minor

In the mathematical theory of matroids, a minor of a matroid "M" is another matroid "N" that is obtained from "M" by a sequence of restriction and contraction operations. Matroid minors are closely related to graph minors, and the restriction and contraction operations by which they are formed correspond to edge deletion and edge contraction operations in graphs. The theory of matroid minors leads to structural decompositions of matroids, and characterizations of matroid families by forbidden minors, analogous to the corresponding theory in graphs.
Definitions.
If "S" is a subset of "E", the restriction of "M" to "S", written "M" |"S", is the matroid on the set "S" whose independent sets are the independent sets of "M" that are contained in "S". Its circuits are the circuits of "M" that are contained in "S" and its rank function is that of "M" restricted to subsets of "S".
If "T" is an independent subset of "E", the contraction of "M" by "T", written "M"/"T", is the matroid on the underlying set "E − T" whose independent sets are the sets whose union with "T" is independent in "M". This definition may be extended to arbitrary "T" by choosing a basis for "T" and defining a set to be independent in the contraction if its union with this basis remains independent in "M". The rank function of the contraction is formula_1
A matroid "N" is a minor of a matroid "M" if it can be constructed from "M" by restriction and contraction operations.
In terms of the geometric lattice formed by the flats of a matroid, taking a minor of a matroid corresponds to taking an interval of the lattice, the part of the lattice lying between a given lower bound and upper bound element.
Forbidden matroid characterizations.
Many important families of matroids are closed under the operation of taking minors: if a matroid "M" belongs to the family, then every minor of "M" also belongs to the family. In this case, the family may be characterized by its set of "forbidden matroids", the minor-minimal matroids that do not belong to the family. A matroid belongs to the family if and only if it does not have a forbidden matroid as a minor. Often, but not always, the set of forbidden matroids is finite, paralleling the Robertson–Seymour theorem which states that the set of forbidden minors of a minor-closed graph family is always finite.
An example of this phenomenon is given by the regular matroids, matroids that are representable over all fields. Equivalently a matroid is regular if it can be represented by a totally unimodular matrix (a matrix whose square submatrices all have determinants equal to 0, 1, or −1). proved that a matroid is regular if and only if it does not have one of three forbidden minors: the uniform matroid formula_2 (the four-point line), the Fano plane, or the dual matroid of the Fano plane. For this he used his difficult homotopy theorem. Simpler proofs have since been found.
The graphic matroids, matroids whose independent sets are the forest subgraphs of a graph, have five forbidden minors: the three for the regular matroids, and the two duals of the graphic matroids for the graphs "K"5 and "K"3,3 that by Wagner's theorem are forbidden minors for the planar graphs.
The binary matroids, matroids representable over the two-element finite field, include both graphic and regular matroids. Tutte again showed that these matroids have a forbidden minor characterization: they are the matroids that do not have the four-point line as a minor. Rota conjectured that, for any finite field, the matroids representable over that field have finitely many forbidden minors; this has been proven only up to the field with four elements. However, the matroids that can be represented over the real numbers have infinitely many forbidden minors.
Branchwidth.
Branch-decompositions of matroids may be defined analogously to their definition for graphs.
A branch-decomposition of a matroid is a hierarchical clustering of the matroid elements, represented as an unrooted binary tree with the elements of the matroid at its leaves. Removing any edge of this tree partitions the matroids into two disjoint subsets; such a partition is called an e-separation. If "r" denotes the rank function of the matroid, then the width of an e-separation is defined as . The width of a decomposition is the maximum width of any of its e-separations, and the branchwidth of a matroid is the minimum width of any of its branch-decompositions.
The branchwidth of a graph and the branchwidth of the corresponding graphic matroid may differ: for instance, the three-edge path graph and the three-edge star have different branchwidths, 2 and 1 respectively, but they both induce the same graphic matroid with branchwidth 1. However, for graphs that are not trees, the branchwidth of the graph is equal to the branchwidth of its associated graphic matroid. The branchwidth of a matroid always equals the branchwidth of its dual.
Branchwidth is an important component of attempts to extend the theory of graph minors to matroids: although treewidth can also be generalized to matroids, and plays a bigger role than branchwidth in the theory of graph minors, branchwidth has more convenient properties in the matroid setting.
If a minor-closed family of matroids representable over a finite field does not include the graphic matroids of all planar graphs, then there is a constant bound on the branchwidth of the matroids in the family, generalizing similar results for minor-closed graph families.
Well-quasi-ordering.
The Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that every matroid property of "graphic" matroids characterized by a list of forbidden minors can be characterized by a finite list. Another way of saying the same thing is that the partial order on graphic matroids formed by the minor operation is a well-quasi-ordering. However, the example of the real-representable matroids, which have infinitely many forbidden minors, shows that the minor ordering is not a well-quasi-ordering on all matroids.
Robertson and Seymour conjectured that the matroids representable over any particular finite field are well-quasi-ordered. So far this has been proven only for the matroids of bounded branchwidth.
Matroid decompositions.
The graph structure theorem is an important tool in the theory of graph minors, according to which the graphs in any minor-closed family can be built up from simpler graphs by clique-sum operations. Some analogous results are also known in matroid theory. In particular, Seymour's decomposition theorem states that all regular matroids can be built up in a simple way as the clique-sum of graphic matroids, their duals, and one special 10-element matroid. As a consequence, linear programs defined by totally unimodular matrices may be solved combinatorially by combining the solutions to a set of minimum spanning tree problems corresponding to the graphic and co-graphic parts of this decomposition.
Algorithms and complexity.
One of the important components of graph minor theory is the existence of an algorithm for testing whether a graph "H" is a minor of another graph "G", taking an amount of time that is polynomial in "G" for any fixed choice of "H" (and more strongly fixed-parameter tractable if the size of "H" is allowed to vary). By combining this result with the Robertson–Seymour theorem, it is possible to recognize the members of any minor-closed graph family in polynomial time. Correspondingly, in matroid theory, it would be desirable to develop efficient algorithms for recognizing whether a given fixed matroid is a minor of an input matroid. Unfortunately, such a strong result is not possible: in the matroid oracle model, the only minors that can be recognized in polynomial time are the uniform matroids with rank or corank one. However, if the problem is restricted to the matroids that are representable over some fixed finite field (and represented as a matrix over that field) than, as in the graph case, it is conjectured to be possible to recognize the matroids that contain any fixed minor in polynomial time.

1970 1000km of Nürburgring

The 1970 1000km of Nürburgring was an endurance race held at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Nürburg, West Germany on May 31, 1970. It was the seventh round of the 1970 World Sportscar Championship season.
Pre-race.
The race weekend was marred by the fatal accident of Finnish driver Hans Laine in a Porsche 908/02. While attempting to qualify for the race at the end of Saturday's qualifying session, Laine damaged one of the front sections of his car; and while he was on the Dottinger Hohe straight going at full speed over one of the humps near the Antonius Bridge, his 908/02 flew into the air, did a full backflip and landed back on the track and rolled a number of times. Although Laine was alive and conscious after the accident, fuel was leaking and Laine could not get out of the car. Track marshals were able to get to the wrecked Porsche, but then the car burst into flames. The marshals only had small extinguishers that was not enough to put out the inferno and Laine perished in the fire. He was 25, and was survived by his wife and 5-month year old daughter; he was one of 6 racers to die at the Nürburgring that year. Laine's co-driver, Dutchman Gijs Van Lennep had a similar incident at the same place on the track, although he was able to avoid causing any damage to the car. The racing team Laine drove for withdrew another one of its entries, a Porsche 917K but a Porsche 911 driven by Finnish rally driver Pauli Tovionen and entered by Laine's team won the GT's with an engine larger than 2 liters class.
It was agreed upon by John Wyer and Porsche that the works teams would use the 908/03, the car used at the Targa Florio. The light and nimble 908/03 was better suited to the twisty and demanding Nürburgring than the big and powerful 917K. 2 were run by John Wyer's team and 2 were run by Porsche Salzburg.
One of the works Ferrari 512S Spyders, entered and to be driven by Jacky Ickx and Peter Schetty crashed in practice; neither driver took part in the race. This just about proved to be fatal for Ferrari, because Ickx was considered to be the best Nürburgring driver in the world at that time, next to Formula One world champion Jackie Stewart. Even with the experienced John Surtees who knew the long circuit well and had lots of success at the challenging mountain circuit in the past, things did not look good for Ferrari- as most of the works Porsche drivers- including Jo Siffert, Brian Redman, Hans Herrmann and Vic Elford were all known to be Nürburgring specialists and were very fast around the circuit.
Qualifying was dominated by works Porsches. They took the first 4 positions on the grid; pole position went to the Jo Siffert/Brian Redman car, followed by Pedro Rodriguez/Leo Kinnunen, Vic Elford/Kurt Ahrens, Jr., and then Hans Herrmann/Richard Attwood. They were followed by a works Alfa Romeo T33/3 of Rolf Stommelen/Piers Courage, and the 2 works Ferrari 512S Spyder's of Ignazio Giunti/Arturo Merzario and John Surtees/Nino Vaccarella.
Race.
Rodriguez led away the 3 works Porsches, which he did for a number of laps. After just 2 laps, the Giunti/Merzario works Ferrari was out of the race with fuel injection problems. When pitstops came around, Rodriguez handed off his car to Kinnunen and Siffert to Redman. Redman was pushing Kinnunen hard; and Kinnunen, who had been affected by his friend Hans Laine's death the day before, crashed his 908/03 after going over a jump at the 14 kilometer mark (near the Karrusell), flipping in the air and Redman went right "underneath" his crashing teammate. This put the Siffert/Redman car into the lead, but by the end of the 22nd lap, Redman brought his 908/03 due to faltering oil pressure. The engine then failed due to lack of oil, and the Elford/Ahrens Jr. 908/03 took the lead, ran without a hitch and went on to win the race; followed by the other 908/03 of Herrmann/Attwood and the remaining works Ferrari of Surtees/Vaccarella. The one competitive works Alfa Romeo of Rolf Stommelen/Piers Courage went out after 11 laps with a broken shock absorber.
With this victory at their home event, Porsche claimed the World Sportscar Championship over Ferrari.
This would be the last ever major international race on the original Nürburgring with no safety features on it. For the next year's race, the Nordschleife was rebuilt, which included making the surface smoother and lining the circuit with Armco and adding run-off areas wherever possible.

Rhythm Killers

Rhythm Killers is the second studio album by Jamaican musical duo Sly and Robbie, released in May 1987 on Island Records. After their prolific output in reggae, the duo experimented with electronic sounds and contemporary recording technology, while branching out into international, cross-genre endeavors during the 1980s. For the album, they enlisted record producer and mentor Bill Laswell and recorded with an ensemble of musicians at Quad Recording in New York City. Along with their live instruments, Sly and Robbie used electronic recording equipment such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer and electronic drums.
A funk and dance album, "Rhythm Killers" has a dense sound that incorporates contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs are characterized by electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.
The album charted in four countries, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. It was promoted with two singles, including the UK hit "Boops (Here to Go)". Upon its release, "Rhythm Killers" received positive reviews from music critics, who found its music interesting and praised the duo's take on funk and dance styles. It was ranked in year-end albums lists by critics such as "NME" and Robert Christgau, who named it the seventh best album of 1987. Encouraged by its success, Sly and Robbie continued their digital direction on subsequent albums. The album is currently out of print.
Background.
Amid their prolific reggae output as sessions musicians, solo artists, and production duo, Sly and Robbie—drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare—opened their own record label Taxi Records and attained a distribution deal with Island Records during the early 1980s. After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired them to work with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences. This deviated from their past reggae work, as well as the genre's roots sound and light rhythms. Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines. 
After their work with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more international music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album "She's the Boss". In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album "Language Barrier", which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film "Never Say Never Again". The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.
A dub album, "Language Barrier" showcased a musical clash between the duo's characteristic rhythms and Laswell's own production style, with African jazz influences, predominant use of the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer, and experimentations with tempo and dub techniques. Dunbar was enthused by newer recording technology and, in a 1987 interview for "The Sydney Morning Herald", said that he wanted to "be a part of it, not be left out." Although it had a lukewarm reception from music critics, "Language Barrier" was Sly and Robbie's first work to receive international exposure. For their next album, they sought to record a like-minded album to expand their audience.
Recording and production.
After releasing "The Sting" (1986) and "Electro Reggae" (1987) as members of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on "Rhythm Killers". They recorded the album over a period of three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica. 
In an effort to crossover with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional hip hop music. Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had started out as a bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation. Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for "Musician" at the time, saying that "We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're going to have to come into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them." Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, "wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So we cut two tracks and extended them, each side consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea." 
In the early stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused primarily on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to "Musician", saying that "I just played what I felt, working from a sense of 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds. 
Sly and Robbie worked with an ensemble of musicians, including funk artists Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Gary "Mudbone" Cooper, reggae vocalist Shinehead, avant-garde jazz musicians Karl Berger and Henry Threadgill, hip hop artist Rammellzee, turntablist D.S.T., and guitarist Nicky Skopelitis. "Rhythm Killers" was produced by Laswell with his band Material, which included Shakespeare, vocalist Bernard Fowler, and percussionist Aïyb Dieng, among others. Sly and Robbie recorded songs in single takes and cut approximately 20 tracks a day with Laswell and engineer Robert Musso, who used reel-to-reel tape recording. Laswell also hired violinist Mark Feldman, who was working at a dinner theater in Connecticut at the time. He had Feldman read charts in the strings section and play syncopated lines, which he found "a little more funky" than the theater. The album was mixed at The Power Station and mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk in New York City.
Composition.
"Rhythm Killers" is characterized as a work of funk music by "Musician" magazine's Alan di Perna, while "Stereo Review" called it a dance album. The album's songs feature contrasting musical elements. Musicologist Robert Palmer views it as an attempt at "an ambitious dance-music synthesis, with funk the stylistic common denominator", adding that the "funk ethos – less is more, the groove is the tune – underlies all of Mr. Laswell's work". Although it is not a reggae album, "Rhythm Killers" exhibits Sly and Robbie's Taxi Records production aesthetic, which drew on their cultural connection to Jamaican dance halls and their collective interest in experimental electronic sounds. Dunbar was particularly fascinated with the Syndrum instrument, and "Rhythm Killers" is one of the last albums to feature live drums by him. Incorporating mechanized beats, rocksteady tempos, and sinuous bass, the aesthetic presaged ragga music and the rise of digital instrumentation in reggae during the 1980s. Similar to "Language Barrier", "Rhythm Killers" has a dense, thudding sound and heavy-handed, humorless tone, but has more recognizable hooks.
The songs are typified by deep bass, striking beats, low-frequency electronic grooves, improvisational rhythms, electronic percussion, rippling, disco-era string synthesizers, aggressive guitar riffs, and stylistic influences from reggae, early hip hop, downtown music, hard rock, and worldbeat genres. They are densely layered in a fashion similar to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production. Bud Kliment of "Trouser Press" writes that they comprise a groove-oriented "song cycle" that is "heavy-bottomed from start to finish". Similar to the album's funk instrumentation, the guest rappers have exclamatory, confrontational tones and percussive vocals. The vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable scratches and African and Latin-influenced percussion, elements that produce cross-rhythms on songs. Carl Matthews of the "Baltimore Afro-American" observes "a noticeable looseness in the vocals and a sort of P-Funk quality to the rhythm tracks."
The "Spin Alternative Record Guide" (1995) asserts that the album "truly broke ground" after the experimentation on "Language Barrier" and calls "Rhythm Killers" "the story of late-20th-century black music done as symphony." Music journalist Peter Shapiro observes "a striking collision of urban sounds" in the album's music, while Robert Hilburn calls it an "unpredictable salute to the liveliness and character of urban pop music in its broadest sense." Mike Joyce of "The Washington Post" finds its "more punchy and elastic" than "Language Barrier" and states, "the accent is still on electronic rhythms, but the mood is vibrantly expansive". Robert Christgau calls the album Sly and Robbie's "Laswellized art-funk statement". He characterizes the duo as a "world pop" rhythm section and writes that their style is complemented by "a chauvinistic variation on Bill Laswell's usual international brigade". John Leland views the album as "the continuous synthesis that Laswell promised on Herbie Hancock's 'Rockit'", "extended in both length and scope", adding that he exhibits "a knack for unexpected juxtapositions and no respect for artificial boundaries."
Songs.
The album's songs are arranged into a gapless suite on each side, both of which begin with covers of early 1970s R&B songs. "Stereo Review" writes that each side is stylistically "derived" from its respective opening track and distinguishes the two side-opening tracks as "anchoring songs serve as starting points for uninterrupted improvisations in rhythm that build to multiple climaxes while drawing from wildly disparate musical styles." 
The opening track "Fire" reworks the Ohio Players' 1974 song of the same name into an extended vamp with an irregular rhythm, percussive bass, and piano stabs by Bernie Worrell. The uptempo "Boops (Here to Go)" has an uncredited sample of Liquid Liquid's 1983 song "Cavern". The song's lyrics proclaim "bass" to be "the final frontier" and features vocals by Shinehead, whose rap begins with a Howard Cosell impersonation, and Bootsy Collins, who advises listeners that "you have one desire and that's to dance until you drop." It also incorporates saxophone and flute passages, a heavy beat, and a whistled verse of symphonic music. "Boop" is a Jamaican Patois slang term for a man who spends money for the benefit of a younger woman. Both "Fire" and "Boops (Here to Go)" touch on popular dancehall topics. The Prince-styled "Let's Rock" features octave-doubled vocals, abrasive guitar, and funky riffs.
Opening the second side, "Yes, We Can Can" is a cover of the Pointer Sisters 1973 song of the same name, originally written by Allen Toussaint. It eschews the original song's jazz influence for hip hop elements, gritty dub, and Art of Noise-like grooves. "Rhythm Killer" features aggressive percussion, vibrating strings, frantic toasting by Shinehead, and downtown saxophone by Henry Threadgill. The song was featured in the 1988 film "Colors". The song's groove transitions into "Bank Job", which has a relaxed style, lavish production, and accented electronic rhythms.
Commercial performance.
Sly and Robbie's second album, "Rhythm Killers" was released on Island Records in May 1987, on CD, LP, and cassette formats.

In the United Kingdom, it spent five weeks and peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. "Rhythm Killers" did not chart in the United States.

Critical reception.
"Rhythm Killers" was well received by contemporary music critics. In his review for "The Philadelphia Inquirer", Ken Tucker, remarked that having mastered reggae, Sly and Robbie prove that they can perform funk music just as well. Steve Hochman of the "Los Angeles Times" gave the album four out of four stars and hailed it as one of the year's best albums in funk or any other genre because of how Sly and Robbie draw on the genre's past 20 years, "from Sly & the Family Stone through George Clinton, along the way throwing in reggae, rap and even a bit of Rossini." "i-D" magazine's Simon Witter said that it is the most entertaining and exceptionally conceived dance album of the year. In a four-star review for "Rolling Stone", Gavin Edwards called it "a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises", and wrote that it "sounds like the Great Missing DJ Set — albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy." "The Nation" commended Sly and Robbie for assembling first-rate musicians to play through engaging songs whose sounds range from Beethoven and Jimi Hendrix. "Stereo Review" said that it is one of the best dance albums in some time because of how the duo's creative, yet accessible urban dance music shows how to combine the best parts of older music with contemporary recording techniques. Mat Smith of "Melody Maker" said that the enthusiastic music is driven by a "schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight." Robert Christgau, writing in "The Village Voice", gave "Rhythm Killers" an "A" and praised both the guest artists' "lyrical signatures" and the duo's "sensationalism", which he felt works well with "Laswell's imperiousness".
In a negative review, Greg Taylor of "The Sydney Morning Herald" criticized the album's music as "wallpaper" and felt that Sly and Robbie misused their talent, which he said is undermined by a gaudy hip hop production. John Leland of "Spin" wrote that while it is ambitious and successful as a "dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk", the album lacks vigor as actual funk music, as it "looks beyond funk to a rad thesis; by my ears it never gets beyond its thesis and into the funk." Robert Palmer of "The New York Times" critiqued that "the insight that funk is the Rosetta Stone of contemporary dance music is a worthy one, but it doesn't necessarily follow that everything deriving from funk needs to be crammed into every tune." Although he observed an excess of disordered effects on otherwise expressive rhythm tracks, Palmer said that its simpler moments are artful and "Rhythm Killers" has "enough fresh ideas, and captivating grooves, to repay repeated listening."
Accolades.
"NME" ranked the album number 25 on its year-end best albums list for 1987. "Boops (Here to Go)" was ranked number 18 on the magazine's best singles list, while "The Face" ranked it number eight on their list. "Rockdelux" ranked it number 11 on its year-end list. They also named "Boops (Here to Go)" the sixth best song of the 1987. "Rhythm Killers" was voted number 25 in "The Village Voice"s Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1987. In his dean's list, poll creator Robert Christgau named it the seventh best album of the year.
Legacy and aftermath.
Encouraged by the album's success, Sly and Robbie recorded "The Summit" (1988), an instrumental ragga album with digital riddims that was decried by roots critics, and "Silent Assassin" (1990), a collaboration with several American rappers. The latter album's fusion of Jamaican dub and American hip hop was a precursor to the rise of dancehall in the US during the early 1990s. Bootsy Collins, who had kept a low profile for much of the 1980s, followed-up his appearance on "Rhythm Killers" with a comeback album, "What's Bootsy Doin'?", in 1988. Shinehead's own appearance on the album bolstered his mainstream exposure as he was receiving American radio airplay with his debut single and performing on an international tour. "Rhythm Killers" was reissued by Island on 4 June 1990, but eventually became out of print.
In retrospect, culture critic Mark Anthony Neal considered "Rhythm Killers" to be an essential album of 1980s underground funk, while reggae historian Steve Barrow cited it as one of the most engaging projects that Sly and Robbie were involved in during the 1980s. In a retrospective article, "The State" wrote that on albums such as "Rhythm Killers", they frequently attempted to broaden the role of their instruments and consequently took bass and drums to "unexplored rhythmic frontiers". Music journalist Mark Coleman, writing in "The Rolling Stone Album Guide", said that the album was "so coherent and smooth that you could mistake it for a suite if it wasn't also so thoroughly down and dirty." In "The Rough Guide to Rock" (2003), Peter Shapiro cited the album as Laswell's "best outside production" and one that "fulfilled his fusion/fission concept ... in which some of the finest dance musicians in the world jam on two side-long grooves that imply New Orleans R&B, 70s funk, hip-hop and ragga are all part of the same continuum." In a mixed review, AllMusic editor Stephen Cook called it "a valiant venture gone awry" and felt that the songs are monotonous and comprising "one tired electronic groove after another".

Global women's strike

The Global Women’s Strike is a movement that seeks to value all women’s work and all women’s lives around the world. Many countries (including Guyana, Haiti, the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Peru, and Ireland) actively participate in this campaign in an effort to grant women justice for their unacknowledged contribution in the labor force. The stated mission of the Global Women's Strike is:
Women and girls perform nearly two-thirds of the work in most given households. This work includes physical labor such as washing dishes, doing laundry, vacuuming, etc. but also emotional labor such as sending out birthday cards, organizing family vacations, preparing for holidays, etc. Much of this work in the household, while at times is referred to as a “second shift,” remains unpaid. It is also not included in a country’s Gross National Product or Gross Domestic Product, although women’s unpaid labor is estimated at nearly $11 trillion. Many of the women engaged in this campaign argue that a large portion of this problem can be traced back to the military-industrial complex. Over $1 trillion a year is spent on the military worldwide, owing a large portion of this spending to the United States. If 10% of this money was circulated back into the community, it could be used to provide essentials for living: water, basic health care, sanitation, nutrition programs, literacy programs, minimum wage. The Global Women’s Strike, which is a result of the International Wages for Housework Campaign started by Selma James in 1972, seeks the recognition and payment for all caring work and the return of military spending to the community through a policy of “Invest in Caring, Not Killing.”
Global Demands.
● Payment for all caring work —in wages, pensions, land and other resources. What is more valuable than raising children and caring for others?
● Invest in life and welfare, not military budgets and prisons. Pay equity for all, women and men, in the global market.
● Paid maternity leave, breastfeeding breaks and other benefits — stop penalizing us for being women.
● Abolition of “Third World debt”
● Accessible clean water, healthcare, housing, transport, literacy.
● Non-polluting energy and technology which shortens the hours we work.
● Protection and asylum from all violence and persecution, including by family members and people in positions of authority.
● Freedom of movement. Capital travels freely, why not people?

Nilgiri Malabar Battalion

The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion (NMB) was an Auxiliary Force (India) (AFI) of the British Colonial Auxiliary Forces of the British Indian Army, composed of Eurasians/Anglo-Indians. Enrollment in the Auxiliary Force was open to all European British subjects and to persons of European descent. After the Mutiny of 1857, a Volunteer Force was created, whose primary function was to protect British families in India. The Volunteer Force units were later absorbed into the Auxiliary Force India (AFI), which was created in 1920 for internal security duties.Its terms of service were similar to the Territorial Army of the UK.The AFI, which provided officers to the Army during World War II, was disbanded in 1947.
Eurasians of Peninsular India.
The first Europeans who came to India were the Portuguese, followed by the Dutch, British and the French. In 1498 Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut. Calicut was the capital of the Zamorin, the most powerful ruler in south-west India. Portuguese women in the east were few in number, and Portuguese men began to live with local women. The Portuguese, Dutch and British instituted systems of encouraging their men to marry local women, paying a gold mohur for each child born of such unions. This young generation was seen as a cornerstone, a bulwark of empires.
The Portuguese used the term "mestico" from about 1546. The British introduced the derisive term "half-caste" from about 1789. According to Edgar Thurston 'The influence of the various European nations-Portuguese, Dutch, British, Danish, and French-which have at different times acquired territory in peninsular India, is clearly visible in the polyglot medley of Eurasian surnames.' Later in the nineteenth century Eurasian took its place until the official acceptance of Anglo-Indian as the community name in 1911. The descendents of these Eurasians who came to be known as Anglo-Indians constituted the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion.
Nilgiri and Malabar.
Two main mountain systems of Southern India are respectively called the eastern & western ghats, which include between them the great table land of the Deccan and Mysore, and meet at an angle in the Nilgiri Hills. The name Nilgiri or Blue Mountains (nila-giri)is probably derived from the blue haze, which hangs over the hills when viewed from the distant plains. The ghats of the Nilgiris lead to the plains of Malabar and Coimbatore.
The name Malabar in Malayalam means the hill country.The first two syllables are almost certainly the ordinary Dravidian word "mala" (=hill, mountain) and "bar" is probably the Arabic word "barr" (=continent) or the Persian word "bar" (=country). Calicut was the headquarters of the British District of Malabar. The district of the Nilgiris (Nilgiris District) and the district of Malabar (Malabar District) were part of the Madras Presidency.
Operations.
The Moplah Rebellion which remained confined to Ernad, Walluvanad and Ponnani taluks of South Malabar began in August 1921. Following an incident in Pookhottur village a major rebellion broke out with the government deploying the army to take control of the civil administration. Between August and November there were two major battles between the Moplahs and the armed forces. By the end of December 1921, the Moplah Rebellion was completely suppressed. Four officers along with hundred and eighty four men of The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion were part of the armed forces unit that quelled the Moplah Rebellion of 1921. Members of the Cannanore and Tellicherry detachments of the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion took part in a combined Naval and Military exercise in December 1924 at Cannanore. Lord Goshen (Governor of Madras Presidency 1924-29, George Joachim Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen)inspected the annual camp of exercise of the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion at Podanur in 1925. During the Second World War members of the Auxiliary Force (India) continued to function as part-time soldiers while contributing to the war effort by carrying on their normal occupation. The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion was disbanded together with all Auxiliary Force regiments following partition and India's independence in 1947 .

Driven to Tears

"Driven to Tears" is a song written by Sting and first released by The Police on their 1980 album "Zenyatta Mondatta". Although not released as a single, the song reached #35 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The political overtones of the song represent the beginning of the political activism that would recur throughout much of Sting's and the Police's subsequent music.
The theme of the song is the divide between rich and poor. It was one of the first politically themed songs the Police released, and the first that Sting wrote. Sting was inspired to write the song while on tour in the United States in 1979 after seeing the plight of starving children in Biafra on television. Sting has stated that the title and song came to him because he was literally driven to tears by the show. The song asks questions but finds no answers. One line of the song refers to the fact that people can afford the technology to watch television, but not food for the starving children.
The song is in the key of A minor. It incorporates a powerful eight bar guitar solo by Police guitarist Andy Summers, one of his few solos on "Zenyatta Mondatta". Author Erica Starr has described Stewart Copeland's drum playing on the song as "jerky" and "syncopated" but that the beats "float around with great ease," noting that the song has "tremendous energy and forward momentum." "Rolling Stone" critic David Fricke points to "Driven to Tears" as an example of The Police indulging "their love for reggae," describing the song as "brooding." Allmusic critic Chris True describes the song as a "midtempo reggae workout."
Author Chris Welch states that "Driven to Tears" "surges with an unstoppable anger." "Washington Post" music critic Robert Hull claimed that the song "has the driving force of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac." Allmusic critic Chris True considers Summers' short guitar solo to be one of his best. Summers himself considered "Driven to Tears" one of the better songs Sting wrote that formed "the meat" of "Zenyatta Mondatta".
Sting played "Driven to Tears" at the Live Aid concert in 1985. He also released a live version on his solo album "Bring on the Night" in 1986. That version included a solo by saxophone player Branford Marsalis. A live version performed by the Police was released on the 1993 box set "Message in a Box".
"Driven to Tears" has been covered by Mike Portnoy, Neal Morse and Randy George on the 2012 album "Cover 2 Cover". Marco Minnemann covered the song on the 2007 album "Play the Police". Pearl Jam performed "Driven to Tears" on their 2003 and 2009 tours. Robert Downey, Jr. sang the song with Sting at Sting's 60th birthday concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on October 1, 2011.
The song was included in the setlist for Sting's 2014 "On Stage Together" concert tour with legendary artist Paul Simon. 
This rendition featured a guitar and a violin solo performed by Sting's accompanying musicians.

Kinderen geen bezwaar

Kinderen geen bezwaar is a Dutch sitcom, developed by the VARA and written by Haye van der Heyden. The first episode aired on Nederland 1 on September 25, 2004, replacing the popular series "Oppassen!!!". After the ninth season, which will air in January 2013, the series won't be renewed. This is the result of a recurring discussion whether Dutch public television should provide comedy or not. The last six episodes were filmed from May 29 till July 7, 2012. Repeats of "Kinderen geen bezwaar" attracted audiences of more than one million people.
Anita Witzier, Hans Klok, Chantal Janzen, Edwin Rutten and others did cameos in "Kinderen geen bezwaar".
Premise.
Gerard van Doorn (Alfred van den Heuvel) and Maud Zegers (Anne-Mieke Ruyten) are a married couple. They met each other through a personal advertisement (hence the title, "Kinderen geen bezwaar", which translates to "Children no objection"). They live with two children from previous marriages: Gerard's son Daan (Joey van der Velden) and Maud's daughter Julia (Céline Purcell). Maud works as a psychotherapist and Gerard is a homemaker. As such, Gerard doesn't fit the stereotypical profile of Dutch men and Maud often ridicules him for being unmanly.

2012 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11

The 2012 Vuelta a España began on 18 August, and stage 11 occurred on 29 August. The 2012 edition began with a team time trial stage – where each member of a team started together racing against the clock – in Pamplona, Navarre with the race remaining in Spain until the finish to the eighth stage, with a summit finish at the Collada de la Gallina in Andorra. After the ninth stage, the race's first rest day saw the riders travel across Spain by air from Barcelona to Ponteareas; a road stage was followed by the only individual time trial of the race, where each remaining member of the starting peloton of 198 riders competed against the clock.
The were the winners of the race-opening team time trial, recording a time ten seconds quicker than any other squad; their first rider to cross the line, Jonathan Castroviejo, became the first race leader as a result. He maintained his lead through the first mass-start stage the following day – the first of four stage victories for German sprinter John Degenkolb, who also won stages 5, 7 and 10 – but lost the lead following the first summit finish of the race in Eibar. The "rojo" jersey remained within the team however, as Alejandro Valverde picked up the race lead after pipping Joaquim Rodríguez in a photo-finish at the stage end. Valverde gave up the lead the following day, after crashing with several other members of his team just as the peloton's pace was being increased by the team on the front, . As a result, Valverde apportioned blame to , while his team manager, at one point, pulled alongside his opposite number from for discussions. Rodríguez assumed the lead of the race then, but held a marginal one-second lead ahead of Chris Froome.
There were no changes in the classification until another summit finish on the sixth stage, when Rodríguez and Froome were the two contenders for the stage victory. Froome had attacked to bring himself and Rodríguez, but a second attack from Rodríguez brought him clear, and with time bonuses on the line, extended his lead to ten seconds. In Andorra, it again came down to the main favourites for the race; for a time, Alberto Contador attacked off the front and maintained a lead of around ten seconds – looking for his first victory since his return from a doping ban – before tying up and Valverde and Rodríguez beat him to the line, with Froome having cracked further back. Rodríguez put another twenty seconds into his lead the following day after attacking on the final climb, and his advantage of around a minute prior to the individual time trial was sufficient for him to maintain the lead after the stage; he put in the seventh-fastest time on the stage to keep the leader's jersey, but by only a second from Contador, who moved ahead of Froome in the classification. As a result, Rodríguez topped the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Vuelta still to race.
Stage 1.
For the third year in succession, the Vuelta began with a team time trial; on this occasion, it began in the Navarre city of Pamplona, hosting the Vuelta for the first time since 1994 when France's Laurent Jalabert won the thirteenth stage of that year's race. The stage itself was in and around Pamplona, with the final kilometre of the stage following the route of the Running of the Bulls, held as part of the festival of San Fermín the month before. Just like the bull-run, the stage finished in the middle of the Plaza de Toros, the city's main bullring. were the first of the race's 22 squads to begin the stage, wearing a different team kit to normal; having received dispensation from the Union Cycliste Internationale, the team wore white and red skin-suits instead of their customary green. However, with a time of 20' 18", the squad ultimately finished the stage in last place.
The teams entered the course at four-minute intervals; were the second team in and comfortably lowered the earlier benchmark, recording a time almost a minute quicker. , who won the team time trial in May's Giro d'Italia, were also setting a good time on course before a crash took down three of the team's riders, and delayed Andrew Talansky, the team's main general classification contender. were the next team to top the timesheets, setting a time of 19' 01" for the course, which held for some time. started the stage slowly but a strong second half of the course pulled them into contention for stage honours, and ultimately edged out by a small margin. They were followed by , who also recorded a time of 19' 01", despite team members Tony Martin and Grand Tour debutant Zdeněk Štybar being led off course by a motorcycle. However, they were marginally quicker than both and .
It was not until the final team to start the stage that the time – and the 19-minute barrier – was beaten. had the honour of starting last due to Juan José Cobo – the winner of the 2011 edition of the race for – being amongst their nine riders. The team were only two seconds slower than to the intermediate time-check, kept their pace up and recorded a time of 18' 51" for the course, to record the first Grand Tour team time trial victory for a Spanish squad in nine years. As the first rider to cross the line, Jonathan Castroviejo assumed the first red jersey of the race for the general classification leader, with four of his team-mates in the same time and Cobo in sixth place, having been distanced, by four seconds, in the closing metres.
Stage 2.
The opening road stage of the 2012 Vuelta saw the riders head south from Pamplona, via a loop around Tafalla – where the race's first intermediate sprint point was held – and the first categorised climb, the third-category Alto de la Chapela, before heading towards Viana. In Viana itself, there was an intermediate sprint point on the first passage through the town, before the finish second time around. With most of the parcours being flat, it was expected to ultimately result in a sprint finish at the stage end. Three riders – Spanish pairing Javier Aramendia of and rider Javier Chacón, along with Mikhail Ignatiev () – went clear around after the start of the stage, making the early breakaway from the field, and the trio managed to extend their advantage over the main field to around five minutes. Niki Terpstra had also been a part of the breakaway at one point, but as he trailed overnight leader Jonathan Castroviejo of the by just ten seconds, the breakaway were not allowed to gain a substantial advantage at that point. Terpstra ultimately dropped back into the main field to allow the gap to increase.
Between the lead trio, they swept up most of the available points on offer at the two intermediate sprint positions, while Chacón assumed the first blue-and-white polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification but only after Aramendia was assumed to have sprinted irregularly while crossing the summit of the third-category Alto de la Chapela first. Having guaranteed a jersey at the end of the day, Chacón dropped back with around remaining, when the gap to the main field was around a minute; Alberto Contador () took two bonus seconds for third at the intermediate sprint point in Viana, moving level with his main general classification rival Chris Froome, of . Ignatiev and Aramendia were brought back several kilometres later, and despite several late attacks, the expected sprint finish materalised where sprinter John Degenkolb took his first Grand Tour stage victory, beating 's Allan Davis and Froome's team-mate Ben Swift to the line. Castroviejo maintained his overall lead by finishing with the peloton, although he was not confident of keeping it, while Chacón added the white combination jersey to his mountains lead and Degenkolb took the points lead with his stage win.
Stage 3.
Although there were four categorised climbs over the parcours, the final climb of the day – the first-category Alto de Arrate – was the key point of the stage. Frequently used in the Tour of the Basque Country stage race held in the spring, the Alto de Arrate climb with a gradient in places at over 11%, crested out with around remaining of the stage, before a false flat to the finish line. With three-time Arrate winner Samuel Sánchez not competing in the Vuelta, 's Joaquim Rodríguez – second in Eibar, in 2012 – was regarded as one of the stage favourites along with rider Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador of .
The day's breakaway was made up of eight riders, who all moved ahead of the main field inside the opening of the stage. The octet managed to establish a lead of almost four-and-a-half minutes, despite one of its members – 's Philippe Gilbert, still winless for the year – being just ten seconds behind the leader of the general classification, Valverde's team-mate Jonathan Castroviejo. At each of the three categorised climbs prior to the finishing climb, Pim Ligthart of took maximum points on offer, leading from Gilbert at two of the them, while Nico Sijmens () crossed the third climb, the Puerto de Campazar, behind Ligthart and ahead of Gilbert. The lead group started to splinter with around , with the peloton's pace being set by the and squads, bringing the gap under a minute.
The latter team's Niki Terpstra was first to make a move on the Alto de Arrate, but was quickly closed down before he could establish any substantial headway off the front of the peloton. maintained their position at the front, setting the pace for Contador, and were joined at the front by . Valverde was the first of the favourites to attack from the rapidly diminishing lead group, with Contador jumping onto his wheel with Rodríguez and 's Chris Froome eventually rejoining their fellow contenders. Contador then launched several more attacks – seven in all – as the lead quartet moved their way up the climb, but each time, the other three riders in the group were able to come back to him. Valverde and Rodríguez contested the sprint for the line, with Valverde taking his sixth career Vuelta stage win in a photo-finish, after Rodríguez free-wheeled in the closing metres; a move that left him furious post-stage. Valverde took the lead in the general, points and combination classifications, while Ligthart took the mountains lead.
Stage 4.
Fresh from the punchy finish in Eibar the previous day, the race moved out of the Basque Country and headed towards the ski resort at Valdezcaray; the stage itself finished at the base of the resort – coming at above sea level – via a first-category climb of in length, at an average gradient of 5.2%, although reaching 9% in places at the lower slopes of the climb. The primary breakaway of the stage was formed early in the stage, when a wave of five riders went clear. Simon Clarke () was joined in the breakaway by 's Tony Martin and Assan Bazayev of , as well as two riders representing UCI Professional Continental Teams; Luis Ángel Maté for and rider Jesús Rosendo, with the quintet quickly gaining a substantial advantage over the main field, as they were over nine minutes clear after , and eventually established a maximum lead of just under 14 minutes.
With the leaders extending their lead to an insurmountable margin, the general classification contenders were looking to avoid any particular trouble during the parcours of in length. However, just after the field had passed through the town of Haro, the crosswinds that had set the course of the day played a factor in a crash. Just as Juan Antonio Flecha had accelerated on the front for , most of the hit the tarmac, including the race leader Alejandro Valverde. After the stage, Valverde criticised and blamed them for the incident. At one point, Valverde's team manager Eusebio Unzué, pulled up alongside the car for a discussion with their sporting director Nicolas Portal.
The ramping up of the pace had split the peloton into echelons on the road, with as many as five diagonal lines of riders seconds apart from one another. World time trial champion Martin attacked his companions at the bottom of the final climb, and took Clarke with him, as the other three riders could not follow the higher pace. As it transpired, Clarke had the stronger finish, and ultimately took his first professional victory on the line. Bazayev finished third, while the peloton came in over a minute behind Clarke; Valverde lost almost a minute beyond that, and surrendered the overall lead to 's Joaquim Rodríguez, who held a one-second advantage over Flecha's team-mate Chris Froome. Clarke assumed the lead of both the points and mountains classifications.
Stage 5.
Following two consecutive summit finishes, before another one in the succeeding stage of the race, the fifth stage of the race was a circuit race around the city of Logroño in the La Rioja region. Over the itinerary for the stage, a loop of was completed eight times, with intermediate sprint points being held on the Avenida de la Paz, in the city. The sprint points were held prior to the conclusion of the third and fifth laps, although it was widely expected that the stage would end up in a sprint finish. rider Javier Chacón broke away from the rest of the field almost from the start of the stage, and managed to get clear without the help of a breakaway companion. The main field decided not to follow him closely to begin with, as he was not a factor in the overall classification; over 26 minutes behind overnight leader Joaquim Rodríguez of .
After a quarter of the stage, Chacón held a maximum lead of almost 12 minutes over the rest of the field, but started to lift the pace in the peloton in the long bid to bring back Chacón. With added help from the team-mates of Rodríguez, the peloton had reduced Chacón's advantage to around four-and-a-half minutes at the midpoint of the stage. He was ultimately brought back to the main field with just under of the stage remaining. The final lap of the circuit saw many of the sprint trains head towards the front of the group; under the "flamme rouge", it was – for Daniele Bennati – and Gianni Meersman's outfit, that were at the head of proceedings with close behind. Bennati launched his sprint first, but with help from team-mate Simon Geschke, John Degenkolb followed Bennati for a time before sprinting past him and won his second stage of the race by around half a bike length. Meersman completed the top three of the stage results, as Rodríguez maintained his overall lead.
Stage 6.
The sixth stage of the race was a return to the mountains and the emphasis was shifted away from the sprinters to the general classification contenders, in light of the two punchy, categorised climbs within the final of the day's stage. Following a lengthy descent from the third-category climb of the Puerto del Oroel, the riders had to contend with the Fuerte del Rapitán into Jaca; although relatively short at just long, the climb had an average gradient of 5.4%. After the usual manic start to the day's proceedings on the road, it was a five-rider breakaway that was established at around the point of the stage. The riders in question were either Dutch or Belgian; rider Martijn Maaskant, Joost van Leijen of and 's Pieter Weening representing the former country, and 's Kristof Vandewalle and Thomas De Gendt () representing the latter.
De Gendt, who was third at May's Giro d'Italia, was the best-placed rider out of the quintet in 60th place overall overnight, but he trailed the leader Joaquim Rodríguez by over seven minutes. Despite this, the lead group was allowed to establish a maximum lead of over four minutes around two-thirds into the stage, before Rodriguez's squad as well as the team in support of their team leader Alejandro Valverde started to bring them back. After van Leijen was dropped with around to go, De Gendt soon set off on his own to attempt a solo bid for victory; ultimately, he was caught before the final climb, after his near 50-second lead was negated. The pace set by the dwindled numbers considerably on the Fuerte del Rapitán before moved forward with Columbians Rigoberto Urán and Sergio Henao to protect Chris Froome. After Urán took to the front inside the final kilometre, Froome was first to attack, with only Rodríguez able to respond; Rodríguez himself kicked for the line from out, and with no response from Froome, he soon moved clear to take his fifth stage win at the Vuelta – having predicted that the climb would make "sparks fly" the previous day – and extended his overall lead to ten seconds over Froome.
Stage 7.
The day's stage was entirely situated within the autonomous community of Aragon, starting in the city of Huesca before heading south towards the outskirts of Alcañiz and the Motorland Aragón circuit, which has hosted several motorsport championship events since being opened in 2009. The finish of the stage itself came on the start-finish straight of the track, having completed almost one lap of the circuit. Despite the parcours of the stage being undulating, there were no categorised climbs during the stage, with the day's two intermediate sprint points both coming inside the final of the stage. As a result, the stage was again suited towards the sprinters due to the circuit's wide, sweeping bends.
Four riders – Javier Aramendia (), 's Pablo Lechuga, Bert-Jan Lindeman of and rider František Raboň – provided the breakaway for the day, moving away from the rest of the field after only of racing. They established a maximum advantage of around five minutes in the opening half of the stage, providing no threat to the overall lead of Joaquim Rodríguez () as Lechuga was best-placed at over 26 minutes behind. However, Lechuga was the first of the lead quartet to be dropped as the peloton started to bring the leaders back with around remaining. The breakaway was eventually halted halfway towards the finish, and it eventually resulted in a sprint finish at the circuit, despite trying to break the peloton, with Chris Froome, Ian Stannard and Ben Swift being part of a six-rider group off the front of the field. Ultimately, points leader John Degenkolb continued his good form in the sprint finishes, taking his third stage victory of the week, after a lead-out from team-mate Koen de Kort. Rodríguez maintained his overall lead of the race, by ten seconds, over Froome.
Stage 8.
The only stage finish outside of Spain in this year's Vuelta, the eighth stage saw the peloton head north from the start city of Lleida in Catalonia towards the Catalan-speaking microstate of Andorra. After carrying out a loop around the capital Andorra la Vella, via the second intermediate sprint point – the first coming just before the border between Spain and Andorra, in the town of La Seu d'Urgell – and the second-category climb of the Alto de la Comella. After several kilometres of descending, the first-category Collada de la Gallina awaited the riders; the climb had an average gradient of 8% – with the gradient reaching 15% in certain places of the climbs – while there were also 18 hairpin bends on the climb, drawing comparisons to Alpe d'Huez, where that climb has 21 such corners.
Helped by a tailwind, the peloton covered over in the first hour of racing, and it was not until nearly halfway into the stage that the breakaway for the day was formed. Six riders – rider Javier Aramendia (for the second day running), 's Martijn Keizer, Cameron Meyer of , rider Javier Ramírez, 's Amaël Moinard and Mickaël Buffaz of – went clear and achieved a maximum lead of around nine-and-a-half minutes but hit the bottom of the Collada de la Gallina, with the exception of Keizer and Aramendia, who had been dropped, with a lead of around two-and-a-half minutes over the peloton led by . Moinard was dropped in the early stages of the climb, while Meyer launched an attack on his own. Meyer was eventually caught by the top four overall and Daniel Moreno (), who had all broken clear of the main field.
Moreno and Meyer fell away from the group, and it was left to the quartet to battle it out. Froome launched an attack from the front just inside the final kilometre, but was quickly covered by his three Spanish rivals; however, Alberto Contador of launched his own counter-attack having brought Froome back. He held an advantage of several seconds in the closing stages, but he started to slow within sight of the finish line. Froome had been left behind by the other two riders in contention – 's race leader Joaquim Rodríguez and Alejandro Valverde of the – and the pairing caught Contador out of the final corner, with Valverde taking his second stage victory of the race, just ahead of Rodríguez and Contador. Froome crossed the line fifteen seconds in arrears, which combined with eight bonus seconds gained by Rodríguez at the line, gave Rodríguez a 33-second lead over Froome; although Rodríguez remained pessimistic about his chances overall. Valverde took the blue polka-dot jersey for mountains classification leader, by winning the stage.
Stage 9.
The final stage before the race's first rest day saw the riders return to Spanish soil, after its finish in Andorra the previous day. The parcours – the longest stage of the 2012 edition of the race – was gradually downhill from the start, except for two third-category climbs along the route; the second of which, came within the final of the stage. With the stage finish in Barcelona, the race returned to the city for the first time since 1999, when a strike by riders over stage conditions reduced the fourteenth stage of that year's race by . The finish itself came at Montjuïc – near the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys – which was used for the last Grand Tour stage to finish in the city, when Thor Hushovd won the sixth stage of the 2009 Tour de France.
Almost immediately after the peloton rolled out of the start, the breakaway was formed by four riders. For the second day in succession, rider Mickaël Buffaz was among the leaders, and he was joined by rider Bert-Jan Lindeman, Martijn Maaskant of and, for the third time in the Vuelta, 's Javier Chacón. They managed to gather up a lead of almost five-and-a-half minutes during the early kilometres of the stage before they were gradually brought back by the main field. Despite the best efforts by the leaders to prolong their stay out front, they were caught with around remaining. Chacón's team-mate Jesús Rosendo went on an immediate counter-attack, but he too could not stay clear over the field. Rosendo ultimately crashed after being absorbed back into the main field, and had to wait for his front wheel to be changed.
Back at the front, the field remained together on the run into Barcelona, with the teams of the general classification contenders – , and – heading the field as they did so. Alberto Contador attacked prior to the Alto de Montjuïc, but could not get clear enough for the attack to stick. However, a planned attack by 's Alessandro Ballan gained more headway, with race leader Joaquim Rodríguez chasing him down. Ballan's team-mate Philippe Gilbert set off in chase of Rodríguez, with the two riders joining together prior to the top of the climb. Gilbert and Rodríguez managed to remain off the front of the field by several seconds, and Gilbert took the stage honours for his first victory of the season, ahead of Rodríguez. With eight bonus seconds on the line, Rodríguez put around twenty seconds into his rivals, with his overall lead over Chris Froome increasing to fifty-three seconds, heading into the rest day.
Stage 10.
Having transferred from the easternmost point of the race, in Barcelona, the Vuelta recommenced after the rest day, in the town of Ponteareas in the west of Spain – a transfer of some in distance, the third-furthest transfer in the race's history – with a near-flat itinerary. There was only one categorised climb during the stage, coming after only at the third-category Alto de San Cosme, with its summit coming above sea level. The riders also had to complete a circuit of around before the finish in Sanxenxo. The flat parcours made it ideal for another sprint finish, as 's John Degenkolb looked to regain the points classification lead from race leader Joaquim Rodríguez of .
's Javier Aramendia once again took up a position in the breakaway of a stage, and was joined out front by the most combative rider of the 2011 edition of the race, Adrián Palomares, representing the team. The duo managed to establish a maximum lead of around seven minutes at one point during the stage, before the rest of the field gradually brought the time gap down. They managed to survive off the front until the finishing circuit, where they were brought back around a quarter of the way around the lap. The sprinters' teams moved forward towards the end of the lap, where , and all looked to set it up for their respective sprinters. Ultimately, it was Degenkolb that was able to out-sprint his rivals – despite having to launch his sprint earlier than he wanted – to take his fourth stage victory of the race, becoming the first rider to do so since countryman André Greipel in 2009. Degenkolb finished ahead of 's Nacer Bouhanni and rider Daniele Bennati.
Stage 11.
The only individual time trial stage of the Vuelta, the halfway point was marked with an itinerary of , with the parcours split into three distinct sections; the first section was relatively flat all the way from the start in Cambados, to the intermediate time-check at the point of the stage, just outside the town of Barrantes. The second consisted of a long, 4.4% average gradient climb of the third-category Alto Monte Castrove, where points for the mountains classification were on offer for the top three riders to that point, before the descent down to Pontevedra. As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. Thus, Joost van Leijen of , who, in 193rd place – of the 198 riders who started the race – trailed overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by one hour, thirty-eight minutes and fifty-seven seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.
Van Leijen was not the first rider to finish the course however, as Rodríguez's team-mate Mikhail Ignatiev was the first to do so. Ignatiev, who started three minutes after van Leijen, at one-minute intervals, ultimately recorded a time of 58' 55" for the course, a time which held for around ten minutes until rider Martijn Maaskant lowered the best time by over a minute. 's Jonathan Castroviejo was next to hold top spot, beating Maaskant's time by over three minutes as he completed the course in a time of 54' 10". It was not until Cameron Meyer started 45 minutes later for that has time was threatened, with the former track world champion eventually recording a time of 53' 53". Meyer's time was good enough to not be beaten by the current world champion Tony Martin (), but his countryman Richie Porte did eventually slip underneath that time, moving quickest by just two seconds for , before the stage-winning performance was completed by rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Kessiakoff, the time trial winner at the Tour de Suisse in June, beat Porte's time at the respective time-points, and ultimately beat his time by a minute and a quarter.
Kessiakoff's time of 52' 36" was not breached by anybody else to start the stage, and enabled him to take his second time trial win of the season. In the battle for overall honours, Rodríguez was able to maintain his lead in the general classification standings despite losing time to all of his rivals. Alejandro Valverde () had been the first of the contenders to start, and he also put in a solid time trial performance with a time of 53' 44", a time that was eventually good enough for fourth on the final stage results. Chris Froome () had been expected to win the stage, but could only record a time of 53' 15"; as a result, he lost second place overall to 's Alberto Contador, who, apart from Kessiakoff, was the only other rider to record under 53 minutes for the course with a time of 52' 53", 17 seconds down on Kessiakoff. Rodríguez, who thought he would lose his race lead during the stage, managed to hold on by a solitary second after completing the course with the seventh-fastest time of 53' 52", labelling his performance as a "big step forward".

Little Mary Mixup

Little Mary Mixup was an American comic strip drawn by Robert Moore Brinkerhoff. It was distributed by United Features Syndicate from 1917-1956. At first, it was a simple gag-a-day strip featuring a mischievous nine-year-old girl. However, Mary aged very slowly over time, and by World War II, she was an adventurous teenager who could participate in the war. By then, "Little Mary Mixup" had developed from a gag strip into an adventure strip that involved kidnappers, crooks, and a treasure hunt. However, the Sunday strips were separated from the daily continuity and continued to feature simple gags. The strip only appeared in 143 newspapers, mostly minor ones. The strip ended in 1956, when Brinkerhoff retired.

Royalty (grape)

Royalty (also known as "Royalty 1390") is a red Californian wine grape variety that was developed in 1938 by Dr. Harold P. Olmo of the University of California, Davis. The grape is a red fleshed teinturier which, unlike most red wine grapes, will produced red-tinged colored wine even without maceration time on the skins. The grape is a hybrid being produced from the "Vitis vinifera" Trousseau gris variety from the Jura wine region of France and the teinturier grape Alicante Ganzin that, itself, is a hybrid of a "Vitis rupestris" variety and the "Vitis vinifera" grape Aramon.
History.
Royalty was first cultivated by Dr. Olmo in 1938 at the California Agricultural Experiment Station of UC-Davis but wasn't released for commercial use until 1958. It was released at the same time as Rubired another Olmo teinturier with Alicante Ganzin parentage. Like Rubired, Royalty was mostly grown in the Central Valley of California where it was used a blending grape to improve the color of red wines. However, Royalty showed itself to be more difficult to cultivate than Rubired and fell out of favor among many growers. While by the end of the 20th century there was still more than 6,000 acres (2,500 hectares) of Rubired in production in California there were only around 800 acres (320 ha) of Royalty in use.
Synonyms.
Among the synonyms that Royalty has been known as include California S 26, Kek Royalti and Royalti.

Washington Initiative 1240

Washington Initiative 1240 "concerns creation of a public charter school system" was an initiative that appeared on the Washington state general ballot in November 2012. Originally filed with the Washington Secretary of State on May 31, proponents and paid signature gatherers collected enough signatures to be certified for the ballot on July 25, making it one of the fastest initiatives ever to do so, at an estimated cost of more than $6 per signature. Proposed charter schools would receive public funding but not be governed by local school districts. An August 2012 financial impact study by the state Office of Financial Management estimated "an indeterminate, but non-zero, fiscal impact to local public school districts" and "known state agency implementation costs" of at least $3 million in the first five years.
The initiative was approved by voters in November 2012.
Ballot measure title and summary.
The full text of the measure is available online.
Language describing I-1240 was challenged in court. As described by the Secretary of State's office, I-1240 "would authorize up to forty funded charter schools open to all students, operated through approved, nonreligious, nonprofit organizations, with government oversight; and modify certain laws applicable to them as public schools."
This measure would allow a created state commission or approved local school boards to authorize qualifying nonreligious, nonprofit organizations to operate public charter schools, limited to forty schools over five years. Public charter schools would receive standard per-student public school funding and be open to all students without tuition. Public charter schools would be subject to teacher certification requirements, government oversight, and performance reporting requirements, but exempt from certain state laws and school district policies.
Support and Opposition.
Washington voters previously rejected charter school measures. Beginning with I-177 in 1996,
then I-729 in 2000
and Referendum 55 in 2004. Each of these proposals was brought forward by a few wealthy individuals and actively opposed by public school teachers, administrators and parent groups. Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna supports the measure, with democratic opponent Jay Inslee opposed. As per RCW 42.17A on "campaign disclosure and contribution," the Washington state Public Disclosure Commission posts campaign information online, including committee and donor information for referenda and initiatives As of August, 2012, PDC records show proponents of I-1240 with a nearly 50:1 fundraising advantage.
Statements for and against each ballot measure are available online as part of the official online voter's guide.
Support.
The registered sponsor for the initiative was the League of Education Voters. I-1240 campaign was funded partly by a "handful" of Puget Sound area billionaires, including Bill Gates, Paul Allen and the parents of Jeff Bezos.
Alice Walton was also among the top five contributors.
The measure was also endorsed by Stand for Children.
Opposition.
The League of Women Voters of Washington opposed the measure,
as did the Washington Education Association
and the Washington Association of School Administrators.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has been opposed to all charter schools since 2010,
and, although the National Parent Teacher Association conditionally supports charter schools, the Washington State PTA opposed I-1240 for not meeting "criteria for local oversight."

Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects

The Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects are a series of multimedia public history initiatives. The projects cover a range of themes and subjects in the Northwest and Seattle, with a particular focus on working people and their movements. The effort, particularly the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, has garnered praise for the breadth of primary and secondary resources made available and its joint creation by academics, community members and hundreds of students. It has been recognized as a model of digital and publicly engaged scholarship.
Projects.
The primary projects in the series are the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, the Great Depression in Washington State Project, the Waterfront Workers History Project, the Labor Press Project, the Seattle General Strike Project, the Communism in Washington State Project and the Antiwar and Radical History Project. The Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia for the Pacific Northwest draws together the resources available on the other sites and adds additional information on workers from the many industries and communities of the region. Many of these resources are only digitized and available through the projects, having been culled from archival material and personal collections and materials including the only known film of the 1919 Seattle General Strike and the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike are exceedingly rare.
Impact.
The Projects have gained attention as a trailblazing initiative in public scholarship and engagement between the University of Washington and the Seattle community to record histories like Filipino Cannery Unionism and the Chicano Movement in Washington State that are largely unavailable elsewhere. A unique, collaborative process has also given community members greater control over content than traditional academic research and created more investment by students in their work The impact of the Projects beyond the academic realm was demonstrated when Washington State law on neighborhood association covenants changed as a result of information brought to light on of racially exclusive housing covenants that remained in neighborhood charters. In other cases, the projects have brought light to rarely studied stories, like the Seattle Black Panther Party. The local Chapter was one of the first founded outside Oakland and one of the longest lived. The Civil Rights and Labor History Project unearthed material and conducted oral histories that form the largest body of material on any Party chapter in the nation, including the founding chapter in Oakland. 
All of the projects have been notable for the quantity of material made available online. The Labor Press Project hosts thousands of digitized articles from more than thirty different union and radical newspapers, and the Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia contains a day-by-day database of articles from the Northwest related to labor covering the crucial periods of 1915-1919 and 1930-1939. Video oral histories are key part of the projects, showing first-hand perspectives that are placed alongside original academic essays and digitized historical materials. The Projects have also focused on outreach to Washington Public Schools, working with educators to design curriculum using the materials to teach students about the sometimes forgotten history of labor and civil rights in the Northwest and fulfill State requirements.

Den Hulst

Den Hulst, spelled at times "De Hulst" and pronounced "Nulst" locally is a historical Dutch hamlet which was incorporated into the village and municipality of Nieuwleusen (today in the municipality of Dalfsen). The northern part of Nieuwleusen is known as Den Hulst to this day.
Location.
Den Hulst is located in the central north of the province of Overijssel. It is a built-up stretch along provincial motorway N377, itself called "de Den Hulst" where it traverses the locality. The locality predates the motorway, which was constructed along the trajectory of the former Dedemsvaart canal (parts of which still exist).
Immediately north of Den Hulst is the municipality of Staphorst, where the Staphorst woods are located nearby. Hulsterplas lake, dug south of the Dedemsvaart when the canal was filled in, is part of Den Hulst, as is the northern end of Burgemeester Backxlaan, the street that connects it with the historical core of Nieuwleusen. West of Den Hulst, at the junction of the N377 and the A28 motorway, is De Lichtmis, the location of a historical sconce and today a hub of roadside facilities including a motel and restaurants.
Early history and the Dedemsvaart.
References from the early 18th century make mention of "in Den Hulst, that is, at the Canal" and "at the Canal in the Oosterhulst". The canal in question is not the Dedemsvaart, which was started in 1809, but the earlier and smaller Beentjesgraven, a drainage channel a bit further north which still exists. The Oosterhulst is the present-day name for a stretch of the N377 motorway east of Den Hulst.
In the first half of the 19th century the Dedemsvaart canal was constructed to transport peat on an east-west axis, from the moors in the eastern Netherlands to the more urban west, where the peat was burnt for fuel. The canal, which ran from Hasselt in the west to Gramsbergen in the east, had eight locks. Hamlets and towns grew up around the canal's locks and bridges. Den Hulst, which had twelve houses when the canal reached it, developed economic activity around the Dedemsvaart. Peat transporters who accompanied horse-drawn barges frequented cafés along the towpaths; Rijkman Wicherson's café in Den Hulst was one such establishment.
The Dedemsvaart's patron, Willem Jan baron Van Dedem, wrote about his canal:
Den Hulst was located at lock number three and the Ommerdieker bridge. People living in Den Hulst were said to be living ""an de vaort"" (along the canal), just like residents of the town of Dedemsvaart which sprung up to the east. The south side of Den Hulst was called the ""zaandkaante"", the sand side, because of the sand towpath. Traffic grew, and at the end of the 19th century a tram track was laid along the canal between De Lichtmis and Lutten. The steam tram took people from Den Hulst to the city of Zwolle until it became an antiquated form of long-distance transportation, when the tracks were removed.
Den Hulst gradually merged with the settlement of Nieuwleusen to the south, which had its origin in peat cutting and agricultural activity.
De Rollecate.
In 1913 a state college was founded in Den Hulst to train teachers in girls' education (specifically, "landbouwhuishoud" education, where rural women were trained in housekeeping, agricultural and horticultural tasks). The school was called Rollecate after baron Van Dedem's estate of that name, which he had made available to enable the founding of the college. Rollecate mansion had been built in Vollenhove around 1654-1655 and Van Dedem had moved it to Den Hulst in 1821, where he had a view of his canal. The school was led by pedagogue Theda Mansholt and later by Greta Smit. In 1930 the college moved to Deventer and the mansion was torn down.
Union.
In 1904, the Van den Berg brothers opened the Union bicycle manufacturing plant in Den Hulst. The company also included building materials and lumber plants and eventually branched into mopeds. It fast became Nieuwleusen's biggest employer. In its early years, Union printed "on the Dedemsvaart" or simply "Dedemsvaart" on its publicity material because people were more likely to be familiar with the canal than with the settlement of Den Hulst; this caused some to link the factory with the town of Dedemsvaart east of Den Hulst.
From the mid-seventies on, Union was plagued by mismanagement and conflicts between managers and employees. The old Union factory building was consumed by fire in 1979 in circumstances that were never cleared up. The company went bankrupt in 2001 and was placed in the curatorship of social enterprise Larcom in Ommen. Union ceased to exist as a company when it was sold to the Dutch Bicycle Group in Schiedam in 2005. The former Union premises are now used by several companies. Another large fire destroyed most of Union's former buildings in 2009.
End of the Dedemsvaart canal.
After World War II, the Dedemsvaart canal lost its economic significance due to the rise in motorised land transportation. Large tracts were filled in in the nineteen-sixties and replaced with a motorway. The canal at Den Hulst was filled in in 1969, although a tract just to the west, in the neighbouring hamlet of De Meele, is still open. As a result of the canal's disappearance, Den Hulst is now essentially a row of houses, farm houses and companies on either side of the motorway. The sand used for filling in the canal was obtained by excavating farmland just south of it, which was then converted into a small lake, the Hulsterplas.
Nieuwleusen-Noord.
In the course of its integration into Nieuwleusen, Den Hulst came to be called "Nieuwleusen-noord" or "noord" (north), whereas the southern part of Nieuwleusen is called "zuid" (south). The Ommerdiek road that ran from north to south was rebaptised Burgemeester Backxlaan. The northern and southern parts of the village are today separated by sports fields and sports facilities. Both north and south have a concentration of retailers who organize separate cultural and commercial activities. A small market is held every Saturday and moves between north and south every half year.
The name of the hamlet of Den Hulst is reflected in such names as Hulstkampenweg and Hulsterpad roads and retirement home de Hulstkampen.

2012 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21

Stage 12 of the 2012 Vuelta a España was contested on 30 August, and the race concluded with Stage 21 on 9 September. The second half of the race was situated entirely within Spain; starting with a medium mountain stage from Vilagarcía de Arousa to the Mirador de Ézaro in Dumbría, before four summit finishes and, ultimately, the customary race-concluding ride into Madrid.
Having held the lead of the Vuelta since the fourth stage, Joaquim Rodríguez of maintained his lead into the second half of the race. On the twelfth stage, Rodríguez achieved his second stage victory after out-lasting his rivals for the general classification on the steep climb to Mirador de Ézaro in Dumbría, putting another twelve seconds onto his lead over rider Alberto Contador. After the breakaway succeeded the following day, Rodríguez achieved another stage victory on the fourteenth stage to the Puerto de Ancares, where the longer climbs started to come into force in the race as part of three summit finishes in three consecutive stages. Similar to the move at the Mirador de Ézaro, Rodríguez accelerated away from his closest competitor, Contador, extending his race lead to 22 seconds. The following day, all attacks were negated, as the breakaway succeeded again; Antonio Piedra took the first victory for at a Vuelta a España, winning the stage by two minutes.
Rodríguez and Contador remained together for most of the race's queen stage, the first finish at the Cuitu Negru; on gradients approaching 25% in places, Rodríguez gapped Contador by two seconds, with a four-second time bonus ultimately leaving the gap at twenty-eight seconds post-stage and into the second and final rest day of the race. Following the rest day, Contador turned the advantage around with a surprise attack around midway through the stage. He left his rivals for the overall behind, and soloed to the stage victory. Rodríguez struggled during the stage, being dropped by another one of the race contenders, Alejandro Valverde (), and fell to third in the overall standings behind Contador and Valverde. Contador maintained the lead of the race until the end, eventually winning the race for a second time by 1' 16" over Valverde. Rodríguez was third, a further 21 seconds behind, with no other rider within ten minutes of Contador at the end of the race. Valverde took final-day victories in the points and combination sub-classifications, with Rodríguez losing the points competition in Madrid for the second year running after losing out to Bauke Mollema in 2011.
Stage 12.
The second half of the race commenced with a rolling stage starting in the Province of Pontevedra at Vilagarcía de Arousa, before it made its way into the Province of A Coruña and an ultimate summit finish at the Mirador de Ézaro. Despite not being the highest point of the stage, the Mirador de Ézaro provided a stern test for the remaining members of the peloton, as the average gradient of the long climb was over 13%, with certain sections of the climb reaching 20%, or higher. As a result of the short and steep climb, Joaquim Rodríguez, the race leader for , was considered as the main favourite for the stage – along with ninth stage winner Philippe Gilbert () – as he looked to restore some part of a race-leading margin nearly wiped out during the previous day's time trial. Mini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first two hours of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes.
It was not until the mark that an attack was allowed to gain substantial ground off the front of the main field. Four riders – Cameron Meyer of , 's Mikel Astarloza, rider Amaël Moinard and Kevin De Weert, representing the team – were allowed to freedom to create a lead of over seven minutes during the stage, but were gradually brought back and despite the chasing by the peloton, the lead quartet still held a lead of around half a minute at the bottom of the Mirador de Ézaro. Despite an attack by Astarloza's team-mate Igor Antón, were able to set Rodríguez up for his second stage victory of the race, with Alberto Contador () coming across the line eight seconds behind, having been the last rider to have been dropped by Rodríguez, to limit his deficit to thirteen seconds after time bonuses had been applied.
Stage 13.
Despite its parcours being lumpy and undulating, the thirteenth stage was categorised as a stage for one of the sprinters to achieve a victory on, and potentially their last chance of a stage win until the following week as up until the rest day, the following three stages would all have summit finishes. There were two intermediate sprint points during the stages, offering points to the points classification and bonus seconds towards the general classification, coming in A Laracha at , and in Catabois from the finish in Ferrol. Ferrol was hosting the race for the first time since 1993, when Djamolidine Abdoujaparov won the penultimate stage of that year's race. Much like the previous day's stage, mini-attacks set the course of the early running, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first hour of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes.
However, just after the mark, a group did form and was allowed to make a gap off the front of the field. Seven riders representing six teams – were the only squad to have two riders in the group – and achieved a lead of four minutes during the stage, with the peloton unwilling to let the advantage to anything larger. The gap was brought down at a quicker pace than normal, with and willing to bring it back for their sprinters John Degenkolb and Gianni Meersman respectively. However, the peloton never caught the breakaway during the stage, and after several moves with to go, 's Steve Cummings made a solo bid for victory with remaining, and remained clear until the end to take his first Grand Tour stage win, and his first victory for the team. 's Cameron Meyer bested Juan Antonio Flecha () for second place, four seconds behind Cummings, with the peloton led home by Degenkolb finished forty seconds behind Cummings.
Stage 14.
The race returned to the mountains for the first of three consecutive summit finishes, that were expected to alter the general classification standings. Instead of the short, punchy climbs that had featured in the race prior to the fourteenth stage, longer climbs were included in the stage's itinerary. There were five categorised climbs, with the steeper climbs coming towards the end of the stage; inside the final of the stage were two first-category ascents of the Alto Folgueiras de Aigas – averaging 6.7% for its length – and the final climb of the Puerto de Ancares which averaged 8.1%, but reaching almost 13% in places, en route to the summit at above sea level. The climb also contained a downhill section of around a kilometre in length, just after halfway up the climb.
A four-rider move initially got clear in the opening kilometres of the stage, but they were brought back before of the parcours had been completed. After that, a larger group consisting of sixteen riders, including the four-time defending mountains classification winner David Moncoutié () and fourth stage winner Simon Clarke of advanced forward. With members of their respective teams in the breakaway as well, Joaquim Rodríguez's squad and the of Alejandro Valverde, sat back in the peloton and allowed and to control the pace for their respective protected riders Alberto Contador and Chris Froome. The leaders held a lead of over three minutes at one point, with the break splitting apart on the Alto Folgueiras de Aigas, and on the descent, Alberto Losada – Rodríguez's team-mate in the break – ventured off the front on his own. The peloton had reduced the gap to two minutes by this point, and were continuing to close the gap gradually as they reached the bottom of the final climb of the stage.
Stage 15.
For the second of the three consecutive summit finishes, the riders had to negotiate two categorised climbs – as well as the unclassified Puerto de Pajares – before the final climb, categorised as a climb of "Categoria Especial", to Lagos de Covadonga. Although the final climb was less steep in gradient compared to the climb before it, the Alto del Mirador del Fito – 7% compared to the latter's 8.3% – it reached 15% in places. As well as that, there were two sections of downhill – each of around in length – in the final of the climb, before ramping up again for the finish. In the early kilometres of the stage, a group of nineteen riders formed the early hallmarks of a breakaway group, before it was eventually established with ten riders in the group, as the peloton negotiated the windy conditions of the stage.
The lead group quickly built a lead then continually went up as the stage wore on, eventually reaching a maximum of around fifteen minutes on the Alto del Mirador del Fito; despite this lead, none of the ten riders were going to make any impact on the general classification as the best-placed rider in the group – Andrey Kashechkin of the team – was over 22 minutes down on the leader Joaquim Rodríguez of . Kashechkin tried to launch the first attack on the climb to Covadonga, but was brought back by 's Pablo Lastras; a second move by rider Antonio Piedra was more successful, and he continually pulled away from his breakaway companions, eventually winning the stage – his team's first at the Vuelta – by over two minutes. The remainder of the lead ten came to the line in individual groups, while the race leaders Rodríguez, Alberto Contador of and Lastras' team-mate Alejandro Valverde were over nine minutes in arrears. Valverde moved up to third overall, as 's Chris Froome lost 35 seconds to the lead trio.
Stage 16.
The last stage before the second and final rest day of the race, the sixteenth stage of the race was set up as the toughest day of climbing in the entire race, and as a result, was deemed the queen stage of the race. During its parcours, there were three categorised climbs and a fourth, to the finish, at Cuitu Negru; the climbs got harder as the stage wore on, with a third-category ascent of the Alto de la Cabruñana first, followed by the first-category climbs of the Puerto de San Lorenzo (8.5% gradient) and the Alto de la Cobertoria, a climb with an average gradient of 8.6%. The climb to Valgrande-Pajares and beyond to Cuitu Negru – a "Categoria Especial" climb just like the previous day's finish at Lagos de Covadonga – averaged 6.9% over its , but was much steeper in the final few kilometres, reaching almost 1 in 4 in places. Unlike previous years, the stage finished on a newly-repaved section of road, just for the race, rather than finishing in Valgrande-Pajares.
Mini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first hour of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes. It was not until the descent of the first climb of the day, the Alto de la Cabruñana, that an attacking move was allowed to be established; the riders that instigated it, were Thomas De Gendt of – the winner of the queen stage at May's Giro d'Italia, at the Stelvio Pass – and rider Dario Cataldo. De Gendt and Cataldo quickly gained a substantial advantage over the rest of the field, picking up a lead of almost fourteen-and-a-half minutes while ascending the day's second climb at the Puerto de San Lorenzo. as the peloton negotiated the windy conditions of the stage. Behind, 's Simon Clarke kept a hold of his mountains classification lead, by accelerating out of the peloton to take the points on offer for third at the summit of the climb. The lead pairing reached the bottom of the final climb with a lead approaching eight minutes, with the peloton being led by , who were looking to protect Igor Antón on the climb.
Stage 17.
The first stage after the second and final rest day, the seventeenth stage was the second last to have an uphill finish of some form; on this occasion, it was a long, second-category climb to Fuente Dé, but was not excessively steep at an average gradient of 3.9%. Prior to that, there were two other categorised climbs during the stage – both in the second half of the stage – with the third-category Collado de Ozalba and the second-category Collado La Hoz also on the itinerary for the stage, in length. The stage was ideally suited for rouleurs and not the overall contenders, who would be looking at the penultimate-day stage to the summit finish at Bola del Mundo, as their only remaining attempt to gain time before the finish the next day, in Madrid.
Mini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for most of the first two hours of racing after several attacks were closed down within minutes. At one point, the overall leaders were in two separate groups with Alberto Contador () and 's Alejandro Valverde both in the group ahead of Joaquim Rodríguez before Rodríguez's squad closed the gap. Eleven riders representing eleven different teams eventually formed the day's breakaway after , with team-mates of both Contador and Valverde in the group. Their lead never hit much more than three minutes, before splitting on the Collado de Ozalba, and rider Arnold Jeannesson moved up from the peloton to join the leaders. A chase group formed on the descent from the climb, with three of Contador's team-mates among them. With the gap at 1' 14" to the leaders at the foot of the Collado La Hoz, Contador attacked out of the peloton.
Rodríguez and Valverde tried to chase him, but Contador made it up to the lead group before the top of the climb. His team-mates helped push the gap up on the roads, while Rodríguez was struggling to react to the pace and only had Alberto Losada for support in the chasing group. Contador attacked again just before the intermediate sprint point at Potes, and only his former team-mate Paolo Tiralongo () was able to follow him. They held a two-minute gap over their closest rivals; Rodríguez was dropped on the lower slopes of the climb, as he was unable to follow Valverde, while Contador had gone solo off the front with around remaining. With help from team-mates Nairo Quintana and Beñat Intxausti, Valverde cut the advantage to Contador on the climb, but could not catch him. Contador eventually took his first victory since returning from suspension, six seconds ahead of a group containing Valverde, Sergio Henao of and 's Gorka Verdugo. Rodríguez came across the line tenth, 2' 38" in arrears, dropping to third overall behind new leader Contador and Valverde, who moved up to second.
Stage 18.
The longest stage of the 2012 Vuelta a España, at , was a relatively flat affair with no categorised climbs during the stage, meaning that 's Simon Clarke would keep a hold of the blue polka-dot jersey as the mountains classification leader. A finishing circuit of about in length around Valladolid was also utilised, with two intermediate sprint points – in Valladolid itself, just before the first passage through the finish line, and before the finish in Zaratán – before an expected sprint finish. Valladolid was hosting the Vuelta for the first time since the 2008 edition of the race, when rider Wouter Weylandt won the seventeenth stage in a sprint finish.
Unlike recent days, the breakaway was formed immediately after the start of the stage. rider Luis Ángel Maté, 's Gatis Smukulis and Martijn Keizer of attacked in the opening metres, and were later joined by Brent Bookwalter () and 's Gustavo César; none of the five riders were any threat in the general classification, as Maté was the best-placed of the quintet in 50th place overnight. They managed to achieve an advantage of over five minutes at one point during the stage, but they were all brought back inside of remaining in the stage. The field remained together until the finish, where and were holding station on the front. British national champion Ian Stannard tried to lead it out for team-mate Ben Swift, but Daniele Bennati () made up ground on Swift, and ultimately edged him out at the finish line by inches for his sixth Vuelta stage victory. Bennati later dedicated his first victory in almost a year to former team-mate Weylandt, who was killed during the 2011 Giro d'Italia.
Stage 19.
Much like the previous day's stage, there were no categorised climbs during the day and although more undulating than the eighteenth stage, it was still expected to potentially bring about a sprint finish at the end; however, an uphill finish in La Lastrilla made it equally capable of producing a result that would favour some of the puncheurs in the race, like Philippe Gilbert () or 's former race leader Joaquim Rodríguez, or even a breakaway to succeed on a rare occasion. Almost from the start, two of the wildcard teams had riders go out of the peloton and attack off the front, as 's José Vicente Toribio and rider Aitor Galdós initiated the breakaway, quickly mustering a healthy advantage. The duo's advantage went up at a rapid pace, reaching its maximum of over ten minutes less than a quarter into the stage. Several teams took up station on the front of the main field; some to bring back the gap for the sprinters, while others to set one up for their puncheurs.
Rain started to fall at the halfway point of the stage, but the gap between the leaders and the pack continued to gradually fall until they were eventually caught with remaining. An accelerated pace by the helped to split the peloton in Navas de Riofrío, with Valverde and Rodríguez both eventually taking bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint point in Hontoria. Several late-race attacks came and went, before Gilbert's stage-winning attack out of the peloton in the closing kilometre. He held on to his second victory of the race ahead of Valverde, Daniel Moreno () and Rodríguez. The rest of the field were led in three seconds later by 's Gianni Meersman; among the group was race leader Alberto Contador (), who lost 17 seconds on the day to Valverde, but remained 1' 35" clear overnight in the general classification.
Stage 20.
The penultimate stage of the Vuelta was seen as the final chance for the riders to take substantial amounts of time in the race, with the final stage being the customary ride into Madrid. The parcours of contained no fewer than five categorised climbs, all rated as a second-category climb or higher, with the summit finish – the tenth of the race – to Bola del Mundo being the highest-categorised of the five, as a "Categoria Especial"; the Bola del Mundo was also the highest point of the race, with the stage winner receiving the Cima Alberto Fernández award. The peloton climbed up to a height of above sea level, via an long climb at an average gradient of 8.6%. The Bola decided the race for overall honours on its previous appearance in the race – in 2010 – as Vincenzo Nibali shadowed Ezequiel Mosquera up the climb, therefore winning the race by 41 seconds from Mosquera; Mosquera was later stripped of his results in late 2011.
A group of twenty riders formed the day's breakaway, representing sixteen teams with , , and the only squads to have multiple representation in the group. Also among the group was the leader of the mountains classification, Simon Clarke (), who was looking to all but guarantee winning the blue polka-dot jersey. Indeed, Clarke took maximum points at the first three climbs during the stage, as the breakaway held a lead of around eight minutes – having reached a maximum of over ten minutes at one point – over the main field. The leaders remained five minutes clear of the peloton as they hit the Bola del Mundo, with the pack being led by , who had Romain Sicard in the lead group. The lead group started to splinter on the climb itself, with six riders going clear in the early stages, before three riders – 's Richie Porte, rider Kevin De Weert and former Vuelta overall winner Denis Menchov of – established themselves with the accelerated pace.
In the peloton, 's Igor Antón initially attacked without chase, before Alejandro Valverde () forced an attack on his rivals, trying to get clear before he was closed down. De Weert was dropped by his two lead companions, while the overall leaders had managed to break out into a group of their own with Valverde, Alberto Contador () and Joaquim Rodríguez being paced by Rodríguez's 's team-mate Daniel Moreno. Their team-mate Menchov won the stage – 's fourth of the race – as he dropped Porte in the closing metres; six other members of the breakaway also crossed the line before the race contenders. Rodríguez was ninth on the stage, taking 25 seconds on Valverde – who was tenth – and he claimed back 44 seconds on Contador, who finished twelfth. In the general classification, Contador maintained his race lead, by a reduced margin of 1' 16", over Valverde, with Rodríguez another 21 seconds in arrears.
Stage 21.
The Vuelta concluded with the now-customary stage finish in the centre of Madrid. The stage had an easy start – with a long and gradual descent from the start town of Cercedilla – before ten high-speed laps of a circuit, followed by the sprint finish. In keeping with tradition, the final stage began at a slow pace, and was a largely ceremonial procession on the run into Madrid. Shortly after the riders reached the circuit in the centre of the city, an intermediate sprint was held at the first passage through the line; David Moncoutié of and 's Grischa Niermann were allowed to pass through before the main field, as a gesture, ahead of their respective retirements from the professional peloton. After that, the main break was initiated by six riders on the opening lap of the Madrid circuit. The group – consisting of pairing Sergio Carrasco and Javier Chacón, 's Kevin Seeldraeyers, Javier Aramendia of , Mikel Astarloza () and Sergey Lagutin for – were never allowed to gain more than half a minute in their exploits and were eventually caught with around remaining.
Lagutin was the last to be caught, just as the peloton started their final lap. took up affairs on the front of the peloton, looking to get their sprinter Ben Swift a victory in the race but it was who set up their sprinter with the best run to the finish line. Having fended off the advances of Italian pairing Elia Viviani () and Daniele Bennati (), it was John Degenkolb that took his fifth stage victory of the race. Further behind, 's Alberto Contador finished within the peloton to take his second Vuelta overall title, while Simon Clarke () also confirmed his victory in the mountains classification. For the second year running, Joaquim Rodríguez () lost the victory in the points classification on the final day, as a sixth place stage finish for 's Alejandro Valverde allowed Valverde to overhaul Rodríguez's points tally by six. As a consequence of this, Valverde also claimed the combination classification on a tie-break, due to his second place overall finish to Rodríguez's third.

Martin &amp; Hall

Martin & Hall was the architectural partnership of Frank W. Martin (March 9, 1863-February 2, 1917) and George F. Hall (1866-1928). It was based in Providence, RI, USA. The firm was founded in February of 1893 when the two architects, who were both designers in the firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson, decided to leave and open their own practice. However, they took some commissions with them, resulting in a rift between theirs in their own firm. When Martin died in 1917, Hall continued in private practice. When he died in 1928 he was serving as the supervising architect for the second Industrial Trust Co. Building in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Originally located in the first Industrial Trust Co. Building at 49 Westminster, they moved in 1901 to the still-standing Union Trust Co. Building, both of which were designed by Stone, Carpenter & Willson.

Stylistically, Martin & Hall were very typical. They were very capable, but not very original. They favored the popular styles of the day: the Colonial and Gothic Revivals. When faced with a major civic commission, they would use an aggrandizing Beaux-Arts design. 
Their commercial buildings ar among their most refined, the Shepard and Smith Buildings in particular. The Smith, especially, used a very sophisticated interpretation of the Chicago School, in the manner of Holabird & Roche.
Other than this, the work of Martin & Hall trends toward wooden residences, usually Colonial Revival. Though plain and unremarkable, they add to the essence of the city.

Trabing Station-Crazy Woman Crossing

The Trabing Station or Crazy Woman Crossing is a historic place on the Bozeman Trail, in Johnson County, Wyoming, about twenty miles southeast of Buffalo. Crazy Woman Crossing is significant as the site of the Battle of Crazy Woman, a skirmish during the Red Cloud's War in 1866. In 1878, August Trabing opened a store nearby to serve travelers on the Bozeman Trail. This was the first store in Johnson County. Crazy Woman Crossing is located at the point where Trabing Road crosses Crazy Woman Creek
Bozeman Trail.
In the spring 1863, John Bozeman and his associates scouted for a direct route from the goldfields at Virginia City, Montana to central Wyoming to connect with the Oregon Trail, which was then the major passage to the West Coast. The Bozeman Trail followed many north-south trails the American Indians had used since prehistoric times to travel through Powder River country. On July 6, 1863, forty-six wagons, eighty-nine men and an unspecified number of women and children crossed the North Platte at Deer Creek (present-day Glenrock, Wyoming) and became the first wagon train to try the new trail. After crossing the North Platte River, the first three major river crossings on the Bozeman Trail were Powder River Crossing, Crazy Woman Crossing, and Clear Creek Crossing (present-day Buffalo, Wyoming).
Between 1864 and 1868, fewer than a thousand people used the Bozeman Trail because of the danger of Indian attacks. One Bozeman Trail emigrant was Ellen Fletcher, and she left a series of diary and notes which described her experiences on trail during the summer of 1866. She provides an early description of the Crazy Woman Crossing:
"Camped at "Crazy Woman's Fork." It was a beautiful spot near the stream, in a large grove of trees. The men built large campfires all around the wagons. It was a pretty sight, the circular correll (corral) of white topped wagons and tents scattered here and there, the blazing fires shining forth through the trees, the busy men and women hurrying to and fro, and the quiet moon looking down over it all. A large tree, bent over like an arch, crowns our wagon. 
Crazy Woman Battle.
The Powder River Expedition (1865) and Red Cloud's War (1866) were military actions intended to protect travelers on the Bozeman Trail from Indian attacks. On August 11, 1865, General Patrick Edward Connor's troops reached the Powder River Crossing, and began building Fort Reno. After the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29, 1865, Connor was ordered to return to Salt Lake City. At about the same time, another group of soldiers under Colonel James Sawyer were ordered to build a military road for freighting supplies along the Bozeman Trail.
In 1866, another military force under Colonel Henry B. Carrington was ordered to secure the route of the Bozeman Trail. Carrington established Fort Phil Kearny on July 14, initiating a military struggle known as Red Cloud's War. The Crazy Woman Crossing was one of the Indians' favorite spots for attack, as its terrain was especially amenable to ambush. On July 20, 1866, a group of thirty men and women under Lieutenant A. H. Wand left Fort Reno to travel to Fort Phil Kearny. Lieutenants Napoleon H. Daniels and George H. Templeton rode ahead to look for a suitable campsite at Crazy Woman Crossing. Unable to locate a suitable place, they turned back to join the larger group. Lieutenant Templeton described what happened next:
"Lieut. (Daniels) remarked "look there" and spurred his horse up, going way ahead. I looked over my right shoulder but could see nothing, but upon looking over my left, I saw between 50 and 60 Indians mounted and in full chase about 150 yards in the rear. I spurred up old Pegasus, punched his (flank) with my gun and did everything to increase speed, but the horse seemed to me to be moving very slowly. After Mr. Daniels had gone 200 yards he was shot with an arrow through the back and fell off his horse, the saddle turning. I could do nothing to help him and did not expect to get away myself."
Templeton, hotly pursued, reached the wagon train, which then formed a corral on a bluff overlooking the Crazy Woman Creek. The battle continued for several hours, until a cavalry patrol traveling from Fort Phil Kearny on its way to Fort Reno, under Captain George Burroughs' command, relieved the beleaguered party. During the fight, a second soldier, Lance Corporal Terrence Callary, was killed near the corralled wagons, so the total casualties were two killed and several wounded.
Red Cloud's War was inconclusive, and two years later, as a result of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the army abandoned the Bozeman Trail along with three forts in the Powder River country.
Trabing Station.
As a result of the Great Sioux War of 1876, American armed forces reclaimed the Bozeman Trail and established a series of forts (Cantonment Reno, Fort McKinney, and 
Fort Custer). The Bozeman Trail developed into a military road and telegraph route to serve these forts. Within a few years there were several stage coach lines that hauled freight and passengers along the trail.
In 1878, August Trabing established a trading post at the Crazy Woman Crossing. Trabing sold various goods including boots, hats, and liquor to local ranchers and travelers on the Bozeman Trail. In the fall of 1878, the store was robbed three times by a gang of about eight "road agents." Because of these robberies, Trabing moved his store in 1879 from the Crazy Woman Crossing to the Clear Creek Crossing (present day Buffalo, Wyoming)
After Trabing left Crazy Woman Crossing, his building became a post office for ranchers and stockmen, and a stage station for the stage coach lines. Local people described the Trabing building as a long, log structure paralleling the road, with three rooms. At the south end of the building, there were two small log buildings, one a schoolhouse, the other a blacksmith shop. To the east was another large log building, the stable, and several corrals.
According to Post Office records, Trabing City was established as a post office on January 20, 1879, with Abraham M. Baumann as postmaster. The post office was renamed Trabing and Andrew King was named as postmaster on August 26, 1880. The Trabing post office closed on December 13, 1913, and mail service was moved to Buffalo.

Mora (ship)

Mora was the name of William the Conqueror's flagship, the largest and fastest ship in his invasion fleet of 700 or more ships used during the Norman conquest of England in 1066.
The ship.
"Mora" was a ship of Drakar design and clinker construction built at Barfleur in Normandy, a gift of Matilda of Flanders to her husband William the Conqueror in the summer of 1066. She was a larger ship and carried ten knights with their entourages and equipment. The ship was captained by Stephen, the son of Airard, who remained her captain until William's death in 1087. Stephen received lands in Hampshire, Berkshire, and Warwickshire as reward for his services in the English campaign of 1066. Orderic describes the ship: "it had for its figure-head the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory. "Mora" carried multicolored sails and at the top of the mainmast was the papal banner, consecrated and sent to William from Rome. The banner was described as "a square white banner charged with a gold cross within a blue border."
Voyage to Pevensey.
On the evening of the 27th of September, before sunset according to William of Poitiers, Duke William's invasion fleet embarked for England with the Mora in the lead. She carried a lantern on her mast so she could be seen and a horn was blasted as a signal to the other ships following. "Mora", larger than the other ships, was also much faster. William found himself in mid-channel, alone, with no other ships in sight at daybreak. Waiting on the others to catch up, he had breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex.
Her name.
According to Elisabeth van Houts, the meaning of the name isn't known although there have been several suggestions. She might be named for the "Morini", ancient inhabitants of Flanders and so depicted Matilda's Flemish origins. The Latin word "mora" has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that "Mora" was an anagram of "Amor".
There is a more detailed analysis of the multiple meanings and possible origins of the name in the academic paper "THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF MORA,THE FLAGSHIP OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR" by Elisabeth Waugaman.

Barbour's General Store

Barbour's General Store is a museum in Saint John, New Brunswick. It is an authentic 19th-century general store building, preserved and used to recreate a Victorian-era educational experience for visitors. It is located at the intersection of King Street and Prince William Street in the Trinity Royal Historic Preservation Area in the city's uptown.
History.
The museum was founded in 1967. The store itself was originally built in the mid-1800s, in northern New Brunswick. It operated as a general store from the 1860s to the 1940s. The building was relocated to Saint John in the late 1960s, and was towed down the Saint John River. The preservation of the building, and the recreation of the general store with historic artifacts, was funded by the G.E. Barbour Company, for which it is now named.
The idea for the museum came to local businessman Ralph Brennan, who worked for G.E. Barbour. He was dismayed to discover that his granddaughter did not know what coal was, or many other common items from his own childhood. He sought to remedy the lack of awareness of local history for his granddaughter and other children of the area by establishing a museum in the centre of Saint John.
Features.
The general store is recreated with historic artifacts that would have been seen on the shelves of a local shop of the era. Goods such as clothing, shoes, hats, preserved tobacco, medicines, household items such as tools, lamps, boardgames and irons are on display, as well as local items such as Surprise Soap, made in the nearby town of St. Stephen, and Crosby's molasses, made in Saint John. There are also traditional items for sale, such as barley candy and dulse (edible seaweed harvested locally).

Season summary.
With the riches of owner Jack Walker allowing manager Kenny Dalglish to sign Southampton striker Alan Shearer for a new British record fee (variously reported as £3.3 million, £3.4 ;million, or £3.6 million), Blackburn enjoyed an extraordinary season in their return to the top flight. In spite of Shearer being restricted to only 21 league appearances and 16 league goals after he snapped his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds in December, Blackburn finished fourth - one point off UEFA Cup qualification. Blackburn's cup form nearly saw them qualify for Europe anyway, but they were knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter-finals and the League Cup in the semi-finals.

Tororo Priory

Christ the King Priory, Tororo, Eastern Region, Uganda, is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. Established in the 1980s by Fr John Neudegger, OSB, the monastery is currently home to 24 monks. Fr Prior Edward Etengu is the community's superior.
History.
Early Years.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Uganda was embroiled in civil war. Hostilities forced the withdrawal of many Christian missionaries from the country. A number of Benedictine sisters found themselves in need of spiritual direction, and requested that Abbot Lambert Dörr of Peramiho Abbey send one of his Missionary Benedictine monks to assist their community. In 1980, Abbot Lambert assigned a Benedictine priest, then residing at Nairobi dependency of Peramiho, to Uganda to minister to the sisters.
Fr John Neudegger arrived in Tororo in 1981. Though much of his time was occupied with the spiritual direction of the Benedictine sisters, he also had the opportunity to recruit local vocations for the Nairobi monastery from which he had come. Indeed, monastic vocations proved to be more fruitful in Uganda than back in Kenya. This led to the foundation of a house in Uganda for the training of indigenous monastic vocations. Neudegger purchased some property on the outskirts of Tororo, and built a few simple brick buildings. This first foundation was placed under the Council of the Ottilien Congregation. Fr Aelred Cousins, a Benedictine of Belmont Abbey, joined Neudegger in 1983, aiding in the spiritual formation of the candidates.
At the Congregation's General Chapter in 1984, the Tororo project was accepted as a pre-foundation under the sponsorship of the Council of the Congregation. Neudegger's monastery was given four years to prove that the Benedictine life could survive in Uganda. Like the monastic community of Agbang, the venture was seen as an attempt to use local resources and skills to build a truly African monastic community. 
In 1988, when the next General Chapter met, the delegates were satisfied with the profess of the Tororo monastery. The community was allowed to open a canonical novitiate, in which vocations would be trained according to the principles of the Missionary Benedictines. To aid this, monks of the Congregation would be sent to the foundation to help in the physical and spiritual development of the monastery.
Later Development.
Despite its initial promise, the community of Tororo had to deal with the ongoing internecine violence in Uganda. On August 25, 1990, one of the brothers was brutally murdered.
The monks of Tororo are employed in engineering, automotive maintenance, and carpentry. A fine art studio on the monastery premises promotes locally inspired art. The monks also provide necessary services to the local population, repairing eyeglasses and running a dispensary. An agricultural school and a kindergarten are attached to the monastery. 
On November 21, 1993, the monastic foundation at Tororo was raised to the status of a simple priory. The monastery remains under the direct control of the Council of the Congregation.
Dependencies.
At this time, Christ the King Priory has no dependent houses.
Personnel.
As of May 18, 2011, 13 solemnly professed monks (six of them priests) resided at Tororo. At this time, the community also included seven temporally professed monks, four novices, and three postulants.

The Monkey's Paw (bookstore)

The Monkey's Paw is an independent used bookstore in Toronto, Ontario, specializing in books in eclectic, odd, or miscellaneous categories. The store is located in the Dundas West Portugal Village and well known for their eclectic store front display of arcane and absurd books.
The Monkey's Paw was created in 2006 by the owner Stephen Fowler after moving from San Francisco in 2002 where he previously worked in numerous bookstores. The impetus for opening the bookstore was due to the need to support his family with another income source. The inspiration and book selection methods of the store is based on his work in a previous San Francisco bookstore that placed books that were too unique, specific, or unusual for a single subject category under a miscellaneous section "Floop". Many, including the owner, consider the store itself a showcase and homage to the printed book, which they believe to be dying medium. Due to the notoriety and uniqueness of the bookstore, Fowler was invited to join the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers.
Biblio-mat.
In November 2012, the store introduced a Biblio-mat machine which dispenses a random book for a $2 coin.
The New York Times' Style Magazine quoted the owner, "It's the store where you'll find the book you didn't know you were looking for."

Hemianthus callitrichoides

Hemianthus callitrichoides (also known as dwarf baby tears, cuba or simply the initials HC) is an aquatic plant commonly used as a foreground or carpeting plant in planted aquariums. The plant is native to Cuba and has relatively high light and CO2 requirements to grow well in an aquarium.
"H. callitrichoides" was first collected by Holger Windeløv in 2003 in Las Pozas, Cuba, about east of Havana. Unlike the related "Hemianthus micranthemoides", "H. callitrichoides" is thought to be native only to Cuba.

Civiletatens Materialgård

Civiletatens Materialgård is a former storage facility at Frederiksholm Canal in Copenhagen, Denmark. The complex was used for the storing of materials used for the royal palaces but also has a long history as home and work place for sculptors associated with the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Together with the adjacent "Fæstningens Materialgård", its military counterpart, and the Royal Horse Guards Barracks, it forms a cluster of low, yellow-washed buildings alongside Frederiksholm Canal. It now houses the Art Academy's School of Sculptury as well as residences.
History.
The long main building facing the canal was originally designed by Jacob Fortling. shortly before his death in 1761, and subsequently completed by court architect Georg David Anthon, roughly to that design, in 1771. The complex was used for the storing of materials and building parts and furnishings for the royal palaces and other buildings. The ring riding columns and marble balls in Rosenborg Castle Gardens are examples of artifacts at some point stored at Civiletatens Materialgård.
From its earliest day, the complex also provided accommodation and studio facilities for sculptors at the Royal Art Academy. Most of the profession's work at that time consisted of producing artworks and other decorative features for royal construction projects. Johannes Wiedewelt lived there from its completion in 1771 until 1802 and as did his two sisters and a nephew. Wiedewelt also maintained a studio in the building where he created Frederick V's tomb for Roskilde Cathedral among other works.
The residence was then taken over by Nicolai Dajon, from 1818 imtil 1821 director of the Art Academy, who lived there until his death in 1823. His works executed in the building included his two statues "Bravety" and "Civic Virtue" for the Liberty Column ("Frihedsstøtten") at the site as well as Tordenskjold's tomb for Church of Holmen.
After Dajon's death, it would last five years before another artist, Hermann Ernst Freund, was given residency at Materialgården. He had just returned to Copenhagen after nine years in Rome, where he had worked for Bertel Thorvaldsen, and assisted by Georg Hilker and Constantin Hansen he decorated his new home, both interiors and furnishings, in Pompeian Styles. It attracted widespread attention with the city's establishment and led to many commissions for decorations of private homes in the time that followed.
Herman Wilhelm Bissen also maintained a studio in the building, first in the north wing and after Freund's death in 1840 in the south wing. His practivally lived at the studio, where he kept a tangle of plants and animals, including lizards, and did most of his works, including the Isted Lion, his "Landsoldaten" in Fredericia and the equestrian of Frederick VII in front of Christiansborg Palace.
After Bissen's death, the premisses were taken over by his son Vilhelm Bissen. He continued to work at Materialgården but gave up the residence after a few years to move to an apartment in Vester Voldgade. Jens Adolf Jerichau also worked at Materialgården before moving to Charlottenborg.
After Vilhelm Bissen's death in 1913, the sculptor Anne Marie Carl Nielsen moved in, together with her husband, the composer Carl Nielsen. They lived in the south wing. The couple separated in 1919 but reunited in 1922 and continued to live at Civiletatens Materialgård until 1931. Back in 1908, Anne Marie Carl Nielsen had been commissioned to create the equestrian statue of King Christian IX for Christiansborg's riding grounds on the opposite side of the canal. and she would continue to work on the project for most of the years she lived at Frederiksholm Canal, not completing it until 1927.
Architecture.
The main building along the canal is 21 bays long and has a large hipped roof of red tiles. In the middle there is a two windows high gable fronted wall dormer above an entrance gate. Various other buildings are located to the rear of the main wing, forming several courtyard spaces. Immediately to the left of the main building, also facing the canal, is a diminutive half-timbered house of only three bays. It served as residence for the stable boy ("foderdrengen").
Materialgården today.
Today the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts' School of Sculptury is based in the mainbuilding. Other parts of the complex contain residences. The premises were threatened by closure in 2011 but temporarily secured with funds from private sponsors.
The Danish Society for ecclesiastical Art 8 ("Selskabet for Kirkelig Kunsts ") is based in 28G Frederiksholms Kanal.

Lyndhurst Draw

The Lyndhurst Draw is a railroad bridge crossing the Passaic River between Clifton and Lyndhurst in northeastern New Jersey. Built in 1901, it is owned and operated by New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. (NJT)
The swing bridge is situated between the Lyndhurst and Delawanna stations of NJT's
Main Line, from its origination point at Hoboken Terminal, and from the river's mouth at Newark Bay. Norfolk Southern Railway uses the bridge to access Croxton Yard to the east across the New Jersey Meadowlands. The bridge is required by federal regulations to open on 24-hour notice. It is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#2950).
The lower of the ninety mile (140 km) long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable. Rail service across the river was originally oriented to bringing passengers and freight from the points west over the Hackensack Meadows to Bergen Hill, where tunnels and cuts provided access terminals on the Hudson River. The crossing of the river was developed under the auspices of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad (DL&W) as part of its Boonton Line, which in 1960 merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie-Lackawanna. In 1963, the Erie's Main Line south of Paterson through downtown Passaic was abandoned and service was shifted to the alignment over the Lyndhurst Draw and the Upper Hack Lift. Operations were later taken over by Conrail under contract with the New Jersey Department of Transportation and in 1983 by NJT.

Eastern United Colliery

Eastern United Colliery was a drift mine in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England served by the Great Western Railway's Forest of Dean Branch.
The colliery was one of the seven areas of deep gales - founded after the Dean Forest (Mines) Act in 1904. 
The colliery exploited six seams containing of coal which could give a working life of around 200 years (at an extraction rate of per annum. The principal coal seam was the Coleford High Delf, a steam coal much in demand and said to be up to thick. Demand led to discussions with the Great Western Railway over the provision of a link to its network.
History.
The first gale was granted on 19 March 1906 to Mr. J. R. Brown. Henry Crawshay & Company was offered the gale in October 1907 and completed the purchase on 24 December 1907. The purchase took place because the company was aware that the coal reserves at its Lightmoor Colliery would not last ten years, let alone the predicted twenty.
Construction of the railway connection began in 1908 along with the sidings but the facilities were basic, having a two-lever ground frame allowing access to the complex. A signal box at Eastern United was not provided until late 1913. 
In early 1914 it was announced that Eastern was not the success everyone hoped as the western portion of the gale could not be exploited because of its geological condition. By 1916 its fortunes had changed, the coal seam had levelled out. By April 1919 output was up to per day. Accounts showed that the colliery was running at a loss until 1923, except for a small profit made in 1919.
Expenditure at Eastern was made to modernise the facilities (including the repair and replacement of the boilers, the fitting of electricity and pumping equipment) and the provision of railway vehicles. In 1914 twenty wagons were purchased from the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (at a cost of £16 5s 6d per wagon) to compliment thirty others. The older wagons had been rented and subsequently purchased (at a cost of £8 16s per wagon) from the Ince Waggon & Ironworks Co. of Wigan, through their broker - the Lincoln Wagon Co. of Doncaster.
The colliery was nationalized in 1947 and became part of the National Coal Board South Western Division. It closed on 30 January 1959.

Sakhawat Hussain

Ustad Sakhawat Hussain Khan or Sakhawat Hussain (1877-1955) was a virtuoso Indian sarod player, a contemporary of Hafiz Ali Khan and one of the major exponents of the instrument in the 20th century.
Sakhawat Hussain was the descendant of Bangash Pathans, who had originally come from Afghanistan to perform military service for the Mughal court in the early 18th century. He began musical training under his father, Ustad Shafayet Khan, but after marrying the daughter of the famous sarodiya Asadullah 'Kaukab' Khan became a formal follower of the Lucknow - Bulandshahr sarod gharana. This tradition had roots in Afghan rubab playing and was heavily influenced by the dhrupad vocal genre.
From 1926, he became Professor of Sarod at the Bhatkhande Music Institute after his performances impressed Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande. He played for a time in the orchestra of Leila Sokhey ("Madame Menaka"), who founded the Menaka Indian Ballet Company. He toured Europe with Menaka in the period 1935-8 and gave many recitals (including several at the Berlin Olympics' International Dance Olympiad, having the curious distinction of having performed for both Stalin and Hitler). He was also responsible for identifying the talent of singer Begum Akhtar and encouraging her early training. He continued teaching at the Bhatkhande Institute until his death in 1955.
Sakhawat Hussain's 1920s recordings are among the very few that survive of sarodiyas in that period, and demonstrate both a strong influence of the tarana structure and a particular emphasis on right-hand technique, common to players of the Lucknow-Bulandshahr gharana, which appears to be derived from rubab traditions.

Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area

The Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area is a historic district in Saint John, New Brunswick's uptown. The City of Saint John designated the area as the city's first heritage conservation area in 1982; it has since expanded in area. Surrounding the Trinity Anglican Church, the area includes several National Historic Sites of Canada within its boundaries. Much of the area consists of Victorian brick buildings raised after The Great Fire of Saint John, New Brunswick that destroyed much of the city's central peninsula in 1877.
Area.
The Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area has more than a dozen blocks, relatively small, containing late Victorian buildings that house shops, restaurants, pubs, art galleries, other businesses, and private homes. It is bounded by King Street, Water Street (beside a cruise ship terminal), Queen Street, Charlotte Street, and includes the adjacent Sydney Street and part of Union Street. Within these boundaries, it includes the following streets: Prince William, Canterbury, Germain, Queen Square North and Queen Square South, Princess, Duke, Harding, and Horsefield, as well as Grannan's Lane.
Although the nearby streets also include a large number of late Victorian buildings, the Trinity Royal area was the focus of conservation efforts as it contains many ornate brick commercial buildings, historic churches, and other public buildings such as the Saint John City Market. 
National Historic Sites of Canada.
The area includes the following designated National Historic Sites of Canada:
Other historic sites are within walking distance, such as Loyalist House, 1 Chipman Hill, the Loyalist Burial Ground, and King's Square. 
Also nearby are Saint John City Hall, the New Brunswick Museum, Barbour's General Store, Market Square, and Brunswick Square.

2012 Trading Post Perth Challenge

The 2012 Trading Post Perth Challenge was a motor racing event for the Australian sedan-based V8 Supercars. It was the fourth event of the 2012 International V8 Supercars Championship, featuring Races 7, 8 & 9. The unusual three race format is a staple of the Barbagallo Raceway event, in part caused by the different timezone of Western Australia compared to eastern states. It was held on the weekend of 4–6 May at the Barbagallo Raceway, in Perth, Western Australia. It was also the first time the series utilised the new pitlane on the infield of the circuit as opposed to the original one on the out side of the circuit.
The meeting saw a clean sweep of race wins by the Ford Performance Racing team. Mark Winterbottom won Saturday's Race 5 of the championship, while Sunday's two races were both won by Will Davison, the third and final race saw Davison on tyres no longer capable of sustaining front running speed being caught rapidly by Winterbottom and Jamie Whincup of the Triple Eight Race Engineering team. Davison won as his team-mate Winterbottom snuck past Whincup on the last lap to defuse the hostile challenge from the Holden driver.

Vincent Chileshe

Vincent Chileshe is a Zambian coach and former goalkeeper. He was crowned Zambian player of the year in 1977 at the age of 20, the first goalkeeper to achieve that feat, and was in goal for Zambia at CAN 1978. He is currently coaching Zambian Division 2 side Young Green Eagles.
Early life.
Chileshe was born in Mporokoso in 1957 and was among three goalkeepers in the family. His elder brother Richard played for Bancroft Blades (now called Konkola Blades) in the late 60’s while his younger brother Stephen was a reserve goalkeeper at Nchanga Rangers in the ‘80s when Chileshe kep goal for the main team.
Besides playing for his school Ndelela Primary, Chileshe joined Kalala Amateur Football Club in 1969 at the age of twelve. He was inspired to become a goalkeeper by Mufulira Wanderers goalkeeper Tolomeo “Juva” Mwansa and while listening to football commentaries, Chileshe would tell his friends that he also wanted to be a national team goalkeeper and to be heard on radio.
Playing career.
Kalala also served as a nursery for the Luanshya All Blacks Football Club which he joined three years later as a reserve goalkeeper. He became a regular in 1975 by which time Roan United had developed interest in him.
He crossed over to Roan but it was not easy to win a regular place because national team goalkeeper Emmanuel Mwape was their number one choice and the reserve goalkeeper was Simon Chande who was equally good.
In 1976, Chande left Roan for Kitwe side Rokana United but after a short while, shifted camp to Kabwe Warriors. Because of this, Rokana lured Mwape to Kitwe which opened the door for Chileshe at Roan. Another break for Chileshe was the choice of Luanshya's TVT College as a camping venue for the national team and being the nearest club, Roan would be invited for practice matches leaiding to him being noticed by national team coaches. Before the end of the year, Chileshe who was also captain of the Zambia Schools team, was called to the national team.
He made his international debut on 26 March 1977 at the age of 19 in a friendly against Malawi which Zambia won 8-1 and he did enough to convince fans that a talented goalkeeper had arrived on the scene. Nicknamed "The Black Cat" he won the Zambian FA cup when Roan beat Mufulira Wanderers 3 – 2 in a thrilling final played at Independence Stadium and was in Zambia’s team at the CECAFA tournament later that year. At the end of the season, Chileshe was the surprise choice for the footballer of the year award by the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). Amid a lot of public discontent because fans felt the player was too raw and unknown to merit the top award, and that Godfrey Chitalu should have been the winner as he had done more on the pitch than any other player, and without him, Zambia would not have qualified to the 1978 CAN tournament. Chileshe was however backed by national team captain Ackim Musenge who said he deserved the award, rather than picking on old timers all the time. Chileshe himself said he did not expect the award but he was pleased that he had won it. “Like all the other players, I was rather surprised at my selection. We all thought one of the old guard would be given the award.”
The young goalkeeper was in goal at CAN 1978 in Ghana where Zambia were eliminated after a defeat, a win and a draw against the hosts, Upper Volta and Nigeria respectively.
In September 1979, Chileshe surprised many fans when he featured as a centre-forward in a league match against Rokana United at Kafubu Stadium. Not only did he create the first goal scored by Zambani Sailota, he scored the second in a 3-1 win. Ironically, he scored past his predecessor Emmanuel Mwape. Unlike other Zambian goalkeepers who started out as strikers and later played as forwards after establishing themselves in goal, he had always been known to be a goalkeeper.
In 1981, Chileshe was loaned to league champions Nchanga Rangers to help them in their quest to win the African Club Champions Cup but disaster struck when Chileshe broke his right leg in the 85th minute of a league match against Mufulira Wanderers in April 1981 when he collided with Ashols Melu. Several Rangers players were in tears as their goalkeeper was carried off to the hospital Chileshe was ruled ot for the rest of the season and this proved to be a blow to Rangers' contintental cup aspirations as they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Vita Club of Zaire 4-3 on aggregate in September.
When he recovered, Chileshe made the move to Rangers permanent but moved to Division I side Zesco United in 1984, helping them to a runners-up slot in the BP Challenge Cup, when they lost 2-0 to Mufulira Wanderers. Despite being on the losing side, Chileshe was voted man of the match after pulling off a string of brilliant saves. He was then recalled to the national team and was one of the reserve goalkeepers when Zambia emerged victorious at CECAFA 1984 and he described it as a very emotional moment because he had participated in 4 previous tournaments and they had always failed to finish first. He retired from international football soon after that, his last appearance for Zambia coming on 2 February 1985 in a friendly against Zimbabwe in Gweru.
Coaching career.
In 1986, Chileshe was appointed player-coach at Zesco and won them the 1986 Division I title and promotion to the premier league and also led them to another BP Challenge Cup runners-up slot when they lost to Division I side Zanaco in 1987.
In 1990, Chileshe decided to go to Swaziland where he coached various teams in a period of 5 years: Police Leopards, Manzini Wanderers and Mbabane Swallows. In 1996 he joined Botswana Police IX as coach for a year before heading back home. On his return in 1997, he was appointed coach for Division I Nakambala Leopards and led them to 4th position on the log. However, the team was caught up in sponsorship problems and he left to coach another Division I team TAP Dragons from 1998-2000 when he became coach for City of Lusaka.
Chileshe gave up the City job after being offered the goalkeeping coach’s job for the Swaziland national team where he worked with Dodge Mahlahlela and Kinnah Phiri. Chileshe was in Swaziland until 2002 when his contract expired and is currently coaching FAZ Division II side Young Green Eagles in Kafue.

Saint John Jewish Historical Museum

The Saint John Jewish Historical Museum in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, preserves and displays the history of the Jewish community in the city of Saint John. The Museum was opened by founder Marcia Koven in 1986. A Jewish Historical Society had already been established in the congregation. 
Overview.
The Museum is based on a community history model. It is supported through artifact donations and other participation by members of the local Jewish community. The Jewish community in Saint John has roots going back to the mid-1800s. Solomon Hart, a businessman from England, became the founder of the existing Jewish community in the city when he immigrated to Saint John in 1858. The first synagogue in the city was established by Solomon and Sarah Hart in 1889. Immigration from northern and eastern Europe increased the community to about 1400 members in the 1920s. Immigration to Saint John waned after this, and as out-migration to larger cities increased, the city's Jewish population declined to about 300 members in the 1960s. Today there are roughly two dozen Jewish families in the congregation.
The Museum has several permanent exhibits, as well as new exhibits each year, and occasional travelling exhibits. Outreach programs include hosting tours from local schools, distribution of educational kits, and hosting tours from cruise ships visiting the city. 
The Museum also has a library and archive of Jewish history, viewed by appointment.
Awards.
The museum has received several awards recognizing its work, including the following:

<doc id="36750945" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36750945" title="Ackim Musenge">
Ackim Musenge

Ackim Musenge (born 7 October 1949) is a former Zambian footballer and coach. Renowned for his exceptional defensive ability and versatility, Musenge is rated as one of the finest defenders to have played for the Zambia national team, which he captained at the 1978 African Cup of Nations in Ghana. He later coached Mufulira Wanderers and several other club sides.
Early life.
Musenge was born on 7 October 1949 in Mufulira. His father Diamond Musenge was a carpenter while his mother Eness was a house-wife. He was the first born in a family of seven of which four were boys. His brother Japhen also played for Wanderers. He attended Mufulira Mine School and later Kantanshi Secondary School.
Playing career.
Butondo Western Tigers.
At the age of 15 Musenge joined Zambian Division II side Butondo Western Tigers, one of the teams sponsored by Mufulira Division of Roan Copper Mines. He later formed part of the first Zambia School’s national team which was coached by John Green and managed by King George High School teacher Glyn Peters. During his time with Zambia Schools, Musenge played in high profile friendly matches against English youth teams such as West Ham United, Ipswich Town and Derby County youth teams.
At Tigers, Musenge who started off as an attacking midfielder and occasionally played on the right wing, was a regular goal scorer. In 1966, he helped the team gain promotion to Division I and went on to become captain. In 1969, he scored 18 goals in all competitions. In the early ‘70s, Samuel “Zoom” Ndhlovu, who was Wanderers’ coach but would also double as Tigers coach from time to time since they shared the same sponsor, noticed some defensive qualities in Musenge’s play and converted him into a defender to shore up a leaky defence.
In April 1975, Musenge was transferred to Wanderers along with Brines Mulenga and Gerald Mungule. This was a controversial move in that Tigers alleged that they were being victimised by mine management who ordered them to surrender the three players to Wanderers who in turn gave Tigers three reserve players. Tigers officials protested to the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) to no avail, and labelled mine management “pro-Wanderers. Many have pointed to this forced transfer of Tigers’ best players as what led to the decline in the team’s fortunes.
Mufulira Wanderers.
His transition to Wanderers was seamless as Musenge held his own in a very successful team which had a bevy of stars. He made his debut on 20 April 1975 in a league match at Shinde Stadium against Ndola United which Wanderers won 2-0. His versatility was such that he could play right across the backline and that made him very popular with fans. He settled in the centre-back position and was a good reader of the game, unbeatable in the air and always calm.
His first piece silverware was the 1975 Independence Cup when Wanderers beat Green Buffaloes 2-1. In December of that same year, confusion reigned when Buffaloes registered ‘Ackim Musenge’ for the following years' East and Central African Club championship and Wanderers were up in arms, accusing Buffaloes of poaching their player. It turned out that the player registered by Buffaloes was an 18 year old cousin of the Wanderers star, who coincidentally shared the same name with him.
Musenge won two league titles in 1976 and 1978 and was runner-up in 1975 and 1977 both times to Green Buffaloes. He also won the Heroes & Unity Cup in 1976, 2 Charity Shields in 1976 and 1977 and was a three-time winner of the Champion of Champions trophy in 1976, 1977 and 1978.
One of the most disciplined players around, Musenge was appointed Wanderers captain in 1977, the same year in which he was named captain of the national team. In 1979, Musenge suffered a broken leg at that years’ CECAFA tournament in a 2-2 draw with Tanzania, which would keep him out of action for more than a season. He attempted a come-back in 1981 but a nagging knee injury forced him to quit for good after being operated on.
National team.
Musenge was first called to the national team by John Green as a 19 year old in 1968 and made his debut when Zambia played a friendly match against Tanzania on 24 October 1968, in preparation for a World Cup qualifier against Sudan. Due to the superb pairing of Dickson Makwaza and Dick Chama at the heart of Zambia’s defence, Musenge would spend some time as a squad player without seeing much action. In a CAN 1972 qualifier in Kinshasa in June 1971 which Zambia lost 3-0, Musenge replaced midfielder Richard Stephenson as a second-half substitute and when he did cement a regular spot in the team, it was as a left-back. 
He was in the team that beat Morocco 4-0 in October 1973 in a World Cup qualifier and was also in the Zambian team that defeated Nigeria 7-4 in aggregate after a 5-1 first leg victory in Lusaka, to qualify to CAN 1974. He featured at the tournament in March 1974 where Zambia reached the final only to lose to Zaire after a replay.
After the retirement of first Makwaza and then Chama in the mid-'70s, Musenge assumed the central defence position and was named captain in January 1977. He led Zambia to the CAN 1978 where they were ejected in the first round.
Musenge fractured his leg in November 1979 at that years’ CECAFA tournament and this ended his national team career. After a long lay-off, he attempted a come-back in October 1981 but a knee injury, which required an operation brought down the curtain on his playing career.
Coaching career.
Musenge began coaching at a young age. He was player-coach during his time at Butondo as they did not have a coach so the players trained themselves and utilised the expertise of Ndhlovu from time to time.
After his career-ending injury, Musenge returned to Butondo as a coach and was then appointed Wanderers assistant coach to Ndhlovu in 1983. He also coached the Zambia U-16 team in 1984 which featured a young Charles Musonda. The team fell by the wayside one match short of the World Youth Cup finals in China.
Musenge attended a coaching course in East Germany in 1985 and when Ndhlovu was promoted to oversee all mine-sponsored football teams, Musenge became Wanderers head coach, winning the Heroes & Unity Cup and the Champion of Champions Cup in his first season. In 1991, Musenge was appointed assistant national team coach to Ndhlovu, along with Freddie Mwila, Emmanuel Musakabantu and George Mungwa for the regional CECAFA tournament in Sudan which Zambia won after beating Kenya 2-0 in the final, despite not fielding any of their big name players.
He was also part of the technical bench at CAN 1992 where Zambia lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Ivory Coast. The coaching team was dropped and a disillusioned Musenge packed his bags and headed for Botswana where he coached Nico United in Selebi Phikwe. He found other Zambian coaches there like Dick Chama at BDF and Freddie Mwila at Township Rollers. The Zambian coaches made such an impact there that the trio were included in the BFA technical committee.
Musenge won the Independence Cup in his first season at Nico United and stayed with the team for 6 seasons with their best showing in the league being a second place finish. He then moved to TAFIC of Francistown in 1998 and won the President’s Cup in his first season. Two years later he moved to Army side Continental Aces and after two years, moved to Boteti Young Fighters of Orapa in 2003. The following year, he returned to TAFIC and after 13 years in Botswana decided to return to Zambia.
He joined Zambia National Service-sponsored Young Green Eagles in Kafue and helped the team win promotion to Division I. In appreciation of this, the ZNS command transferred him to Green Eagles in Kabwe where he worked with coach Jim Mwale in guiding the team to the Super Division. After four years, Musenge parted company with Eagles in 2011 and retired to his farm in Nyimba.
Personal life.
Musenge is married to Christine and they have three children; Hector, Wendy and Diana.

Kvæøya

Kvæøya is an island in the municipality of Kvæfjord in Troms county, Norway. It is located in the Kvæfjorden, an arm of the Gullesfjorden. The island sits about southwest of the village of Borkenes. In 2010, the Kvæøy Bridge was completed, connecting the village of Hundstad on the island to a point just west of the village of Straumen on the main island of Hinnøya.
The island is considered as very favorable to farming, with large farms located on southern and western sides. The northern and eastern sides of the island are steep and mountainous.

Wilbur F. Storey

Wilbur Fisk Storey (19 December 1819, Salisbury, Vermont - 27 October 1884, Chicago, Illinois) was a United States journalist.
Biography.
He received a common-school education, learned the printing trade at 12 years of age, and supplemented his training by wide miscellaneous reading. He worked steadily in the office of the Middlebury "True Press" until he was 17 years old, when he went to New York City and set type on the "Journal of Commerce". Two years later he went to La Porte, Indiana, and had there his first experience in publishing a newspaper, which was unsuccessful. He kept a drug store for some time, and edited a country weekly.
Growing tired of Indiana, he went to Jackson, Michigan, and studied law for two years. He next established the Jackson "Patriot", which gave consistent support to the Democratic point of view. He was appointed postmaster for Jackson under James K. Polk's administration as a reward for his support, whereupon he sold the paper. In 1849, he was removed from his office by Zachary Taylor, and he set up another drug store. He was chosen the year following a member of the Michigan constitutional convention, and subsequently appointed state prison inspector.
In 1853 he moved to Detroit, bought an interest in the "Free Press", and ere long rose to be its editor and sole owner. He went to Chicago in 1861 and purchased the "Times", which then had a very small circulation. He redid the typography, sensationalized the presentation, and added local news. His energy, enterprise, and fearless expression of his views on every subject gave the paper notoriety. He was independent in an extreme way, boasting that he had no friends and wanted none, and apparently doing his utmost to create enemies. His whole mind was bent on giving the news, though his idea of what constituted news frequently struck some as morbid and indecorous. His efforts yielded him a large fortune.
Storey had supported Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential election. While opposing secession, the "Times" became a vehement critic of Abraham Lincoln after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. General Ambrose Burnside shut it down in 1863 for two days, but loyalists complained about the suppression of freedom of the press, and Lincoln quickly lifted the ban on the paper's publication. The paper's plant was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but after publishing out of improvised facilities for two years, it began publishing from a new facility in 1873. It established a London bureau in 1877 to get news on the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.
Storey was a manager, and generally left the writing to others. About 1877 his health began to fail, and he went abroad. In the summer of 1878 he had a paralytic stroke, and was brought home. He was adjudged of unsound mind in 1884, and a conservator of his estate was appointed by the courts.

Styled to Rock (UK TV series)

Styled to Rock is a British reality television series on Sky Living, executive produced by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna which focuses on fashion design. The contestants compete with each other to create the best outfit for one or more famous music acts every week. They are restricted in time and materials. Their designs are judged and the music act of the week choses his favorite one. One designer is eliminated each week.
On 25 October 2013, The United States version of "Styled to Rock" premiered on Bravo.
Format.
Similar to the American series "Project Runway", hosted by German top model Heidi Klum, the British series is also looking for new designers to create fashion for A-list celebrities in the world. Supported by their mentors, the candidates who were chosen as well as the mentors all by Rihanna personally, fight in a ten-week battle for the final. Weekly the candidates design outfits for one ore more music celebrities. Normally the celebrities select the winners outfit by themselves. So every week there is a winner, but also two candidates who have to assert themselves in conversation again, until finally the worst of the week will be suspended. In the final, the two best designers fight to create an outfit for Rihanna herself which she wore during her performance at the Wireless Festival on 8 July 2012.
The reason why Rihanna wanted to run this format just in the United Kingdom and especially in London, she told in the introduction of the first episode. She said that in London the "children of the street" have a unique street style, which can/has inspired numerous designers. Because these people can't show their talent easily, Rihanna wanted to give them a chance to get the attention they deserve. With the format also the candidates who have not managed in the show could eventually establish themselves independently in the fashion world through the hype and the media attention.
Overview.
"Styled to Rock" premiered its first season on 14 August 2012 at 9pm.
Mentors.
The three mentors of the candidates were British recording artist and entrepreneur Nicola Roberts, British fashion designer, businessman and blogger Henry Holland and American celebrity stylist Lysa Cooper.

Aavoor Pasupatheeswaram

Aavoor Pasupatheeswaram or Aavoor Pasupatheeswarar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Hindu god Shiva, located in the village Aavoor, located 12 km south of South Indian town, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu. The temple is one of the 70 "madakoil" built by 2nd century Chola king, Kochengat Chola. The temple is known for the Panchabairavar, the five images of Bhairavar. The temple is reverred in the verses of "Tevaram", the 7th century Tamil Saiva canon by Tirugnana Sambandar.
Legend.
Pasupatheeswarar indicates God of cows. Shiva is believed to have descended for the holy cow Kamadenu that prayed to him by ablution with their milk on the Shivalingam to get relief from the curse of sage Vashista. A sculpture indicating the legend is present in the walls of the second precinct of the temple. Another legend associates the temple with the saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE). Tirumular saw a herd of cows lamenting the death of their herdsmen. Being a "siddha", he entered into the body of dead herdsman, came back alive to serve as the herdsman and sung 3000 verses in praise of Shiva. The legend is closely associated with Gomukteswarar temple at Tiruvadurai, but is also associated with other temples like Thenupuriswarar Temple at Patteswaram and Tirukogarnam near Pudukkottai.
Maadakovil.
Kochengat Chola was a Chola king and one of the 63 nayanmars (saivite saints) of saivism. He is believed to have attained spiritual rebirth of a spider that fought with an elephant in its previous birth over the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. He had red eyes during birth as he remained in his mother’s womb a little longer. His mother, looking into the babies red eyes said Kochengkannano (in Tamil ko=king, cheng=red, kan=eyes), which literally means king with red eyes and hence he was named Kochengat Cholan. After becoming a king, he followed saivism and built 70 "Maadakovils", temples with elevated structure where elephants cannot reach the sanctum, in the Chola empire. The temple has an inscription (181 of 1911) dating from the 3rd year of the rule of Rajendra Chola III (1246-1279 CE) indicating grants of land to the temple.
The Temple.
The temple is located 10 km away from Kumbakonam, 6 km east of Tirukarugavoor and 30 km south of Thanjavur. The temple has a five tiered "Rajagopuram" with an elevated structure for the main shrine. The images of the presiding deity, Pasupatheeswarar, in the form of Shiva lingam occupies the main sanctum. The consort of Pasupatheeswarar, Mangalanayagi and Pangajavalli occupy twin sanctums facing west. The images of Panchabairavar, the five Bairavar statues are found in the corner facing the main sanctum. The second "prakaram" downstairs has a separate shrine for the Hindu god Murugan in the form Dhanush Subramaniyar. Muruga sports a "dhanush" (bow) instead of his regular weapon, the "vel". The temple has a small tank called Braham Tirtham located outside the main entrance.
Literary Mention.
The temple is revered in the verses of "Tevaram", the 7th century saivite canonical work by the three saint poets namely, Appar, Campantar and Cuntarar. The temple is reverred by Campantar in the first "Tirumurai" in eleven verses. He refers to the temple as Avoor Pasupatheeswaram.

It is a contemporary R&B ballad was written and produced by Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, while additional songwriting was done by Kenneth Coby and Crystal Johnson. Lyrically, Amaro wants her man to stop wasting time and enjoy time with her while they have it. It was first made available for stream on August 16, 2012, and it was digitally released as the b-side to Amaro's debut single "Don't Fail Me Now" on September 18, 2012. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it a better offering than "Don't Fail Me Now". "Love Me Now" failed to enter on any of the main "Billboard" component charts. 
Background and composition.
"Love Me Now" was written and produced by Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, while additional songwriting was done by Kenneth Coby and Crystal Johnson. In an interview with "Billboard", Amaro spoke that she "look for songs that are connected to real life scenarios -- love songs, breakups, getting hurt, finding the strength to keep on pushing in life." "Love Me Now" is a mid-tempo R&B ballad with a minimalist beat and production, which, according to Jessica Sager of Pop Crush, allows the singer's vocals to "shine". Lyrically, Amaro wants her man to stop wasting time and enjoy time with her while they have it, singing, "Boy, drop the world and love me now/ Hurry up boy, you’re waiting too long / Listen to the urgency in this tone." The song was released to stream on August 16, 2012, being released for digital download on September 18, 2012 along with "Don't Fail Me Now".
Critical reception.
"Love Me Now" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Armando Tinoco of Terra deemed it "a much stronger tune" than Amaro's debut single, "Don't Fail Me Now", and added that "we can hear her potential and vocal range much better." Pop Crush contributor Jessica Sager found the track "a better fit for Amaro’s larger-than-life voice than its predecessors," while "Rap-Up" reviewer commented that the singer "shows off her powerful pipes" in "Love Me Now", and noted that she "yearns for some lovin’ on the soulful ballad." Becky Bain of Idolator gave a negative review to the track, saying that "it's another personality-lacking, repetitive slow jam where she’s practically belting the whole song. Can someone please save this girl’s career before it starts?"
Chart performance.
"Love Me Now" was released as the b-side to Amaro's debut single "Don't Fail Me Now", which as of December 2012 has sold approximately 20,000 copies.

During his junior year, he was vice-president of the drama club and had a leading role in the play, "What Happened to Jones?" with Irene Hervey, then Irene Herwick. He played center on the varsity basketball team and was a member of the swimming team.
Early career.
George studied dance with Roy Randolph of the Randolph's La Monica Dance School in Santa Monica, California. Shortly after turning 20, he developed a dance act - Mann & Clark - with his high school friend Lester Clark. Signing with the William Meiklejohn Agency, they performed together in Los Angeles for three or four months before George signed on as a single with Fanchon and Marco enterprises. George (6'6") was soon performing for comedic effect with a much shorter (4'11") Dewey Barto (father of the comedienne Nancy Walker). Two days after George turned 21, George and Dewey signed a ten-year contract with Fanchon and Marco as the comedy team Barto and Mann.
Barto and Mann.
During 1926, they performed up and down the west coast until William Morris of the William Morris Agency booked them “cold" (having never appeared on the east coast) into the Palace Theatre on March 14, 1927 during its celebration of vaudeville's 100th anniversary. They were a great success. With offers from all the major vaudeville circuits, they chose to sign with the Orpheum Circuit, with whom they toured across the U.S. until they signed with the Earl Carroll's Vanities from August 1928 to February 1929. They continued touring in the U.S. and Canada, with European tours in the summers of 1931 and 1934.
George met Barbara Bradford, a top model at the John Robert Powers modeling agency, in March 1936. They were married in June 1937. In 1938, George and Barbara appeared in a very short film directed by George starring The Three Stooges. George and Barbara had one son, Brad, born in February 1941. George and Barbara were divorced in June 1943. George never remarried.
As vaudeville faded, Barto & Mann joined the Broadway cast of Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson's Hellzapoppin, with featured billing from 1938 through 1942. The team split up in December 1943 when George began working for Douglas Aircraft Company providing entertainment for Douglas employees, but worked together again briefly to perform with the USO.
Photographer.
Following World War II, George acted in small roles in several movies, on the stage, and with Jack Carson's stage revue but primarily devoted himself to making a living with photography, an activity he had pursued actively while in vaudeville when he took about 12,000 black and white photographs, many of them demonstrating an extraordinary skill and aesthetic sensibility. He also took thousands of feet of B&W and color 16mm film.
In the late 1940s, George began a period of invention, first designing and obtaining a patent for an endless magnetic loop recording and playback device, elements of which were later incorporated into the Lear Jet Stereo 8 track cartridge player. George and Bill Lear became close friends after George introduced Bill to his future wife, Ole Olsen’s daughter Moya. George next turned his inventive and mechanical skills to designing a 3-D viewer that would display the 3-D photographs he was taking, mostly around Southern California. He leased the viewers to various Los Angeles businesses, including Hody's Drive-Ins, other restaurants, bars and doctor's offices. Every couple of weeks, George would swap out the 3-D photographs of such places as Calico Ghost Town, Catalina Island, Descanso Gardens, Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, Pacific Ocean Park, Watts Towers, Palm Springs, Salton Sea or Las Vegas.
King Vitaman.
In the early 1970s, George was hired by Quaker Oats to portray King Vitaman in commercials and on the front of the King Vitaman cereal box.
George Mann lived in Santa Monica, California at the time of his death on November 23, 1977 at age 71.

Gabrielle Robinne

Gabrielle Anna Charlotte Robinne (1 July 1886 – 18 December 1980) was French a stage and film actress whose career spanned over sixty years.
Career.
Born in Montluçon, Allier, France, Robinne was a pupil of Maurice de Féraudy at the Paris Conservatory. In 1904 she entered the company of Sarah Bernhardt and for a year she joined the Theatre Michel in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her career blossomed while performing at the Comédie-Française in 1907 and she became a "sociétaire" in 1924 and remained there until 1938. She made her film debut in the 1906 Segundo de Chomón-directed short "Le troubadour". She is often regarded by critics to be the first French star of the silent film era.
Gabrielle Robinne alternated her time between the stage and film. Between 1906 and 1973, Robinne would appear in nearly fifty films. Her last film appearance was a role in the 1973 Stanislav Stanojevic-directed drama "Le journal d'un suicidé" (English release title: "Diary of a Suicide").
Personal life and death.
Gabrielle Robinne was married to actor René Alexandre from 1912 until his death in 1946. She never remarried. She died in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine, France in 1980 at the age of 94.
Legacy.
In 2006, after several years of restoration, the local theatre in Robinne's home village of Montluçon was renamed the Théâtre Municipal Gabrielle Robinne and was opened to the public by actress Audrey Tautou. Renovated at a cost of €2.5 million, the theatre was named in Robinne's honor and was mainly financed by the State, the General Council and the Regional Council. The theatre was originally founded in 1912 and opened 17 January 1914, with Robinne present on the day of the first opening. 
For her work in the French arts, Gabrielle Robinne was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor .

Flame supervision device

For gas appliances, a flame supervision device (FSD) – alternative name: flame failure device (FFD) – is a general term for any device designed to stop flammable gas going to the burner of a gas appliance if the flame is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room. Causes of flame failure include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the draught from an oven door being opened and closed.
There are many types of FSDs utilising different technologies such as thermoelectric valves, flame conductance, flame rectification, ultraviolet sensing devices and liquid expansion valves. FSDs are found on all modern gas appliances.
Cooker hotplates may not have a FSD on each burner. If a hotplate is to be used in a multi-occupancy building every burner must have its own FSD.
When the FSD activates it should stop (or reduce to safe levels) gas flow to the burner until it is reset manually.
Older devices, such as bimetallic strips, were used in conjunction with pilot lights. The pilot light is no longer used in new devices, but may still be encountered on old appliances still in service. Pilot lights were withdrawn for two reasons: their continual small flame represented a waste of fuel and also the FSD protected only the main burner, not the pilot. If the pilot was extinguished, there was still the risk of a small gas leakage.
Regular testing of FSD is a part of routine maintenance for gas appliances.
Other safety devices may be fitted in addition to an FSD. One type of these are the Vititation Sensing Devices, that detect an adequate supply of oxygen for efficient combustion, thus avoiding the production of poisonous carbon monoxide. As well as detecting a blocked supply of oxygen, these must also detect a blocked exhaust or reversed flow in the exhaust flue owing to wind conditions. Two methods are used to provide these, an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) that measures the availability of oxygen for combustion or an Atmospheric Sensing Device (ASD) measures excess heat rise in the exhaust.

Indicud

Indicud is the third studio album by American hip hop recording artist Kid Cudi. The album was released on April 12, 2013 by Republic Records. It was the first album of Cudi's solo career to not be an installment of his "Man on the Moon" series. The album's cover artwork was designed by Kid Cudi himself, who also served as an executive producer of "Indicud". It was Cudi's goal to make more uptempo and positive music with the album. He described it as a completely new format compared to his previous albums.
The album's record production was handled entirely by Cudi as well, with only record producer Hit-Boy co-producing one track, while Cudi's WZRD bandmate Dot da Genius, provided drums on two. The album features guest appearances from fellow American rappers King Chip, Kendrick Lamar, Too Short, RZA, and ASAP Rocky as well as appearances from American singer-songwriters Father John Misty and Michael Bolton along with indie rock band Haim.
The early release of "Indicud" was preceded by four singles – "Just What I Am" featuring King Chip, "King Wizard", "Immortal" and "Girls" featuring Too Short. "Indicud" debuted at number two in the US with sales of 140,000 copies and debuted at number 32 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Cudi's highest-charting album on the chart, while entering at number two on the UK R&B Chart. The album received mixed to positive reviews from the majority of music critics upon its release.
Background.
After his crossover into rock music with Dot da Genius, on their 2012 project "WZRD", Cudi soon began working on his third solo studio album. The album was initially going to be the third installment to his "Man on the Moon" series, which he announced when he revealed he would not be releasing the "A Man Named Scott" mixtape, to focus on his rock project and "MOTM3". Be that as it may, in the summer of 2012 Cudi announced the title of his third studio album when he tweeted: "My new album is entitled "indicud", it will be my version of "The Chronic 2001", some songs i'll produce, others i'll feat &/or play songwriter". On June 8, 2012, Cudi announced "Indicud", would be a double-disc album, until tweeting on October 28, 2012 that ""Indicud" will not be a double disc but will contain a maximum of 17 brand new jams." Kid Cudi also tweeted: "The overall tone of "indicud" is positive and confident," adding: "The energy of "Indicud" is its own new thing. New format with some of my favorite musical tricks here and there. The album moves dope".
Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi dedicated "Indicud" to the late Ben Breedlove and all his fans that passed away, continuing: "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album "" (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: "I always try to push myself to the next level with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on "Indicud," I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit."
After announcing his departure from GOOD Music, Cudi revealed "Indicud" would be his last album under the label, adding that only the first 200,000 copies printed would have the GOOD Music logo on it; making them collector's items.
Recording.
In April 2012, in Geneseo, New York, Cudi performed before a sold out crowd and premiered a hip hop song, his first since 2010. During his set, he performed a new record, tentatively titled "The Leader of the Delinquents", which he did a cappella. On April 25, 2012 Cudi was officially back to rapping with the release of "Dennis, Hook Me Up with Some More of That Whiskey!". The song, the first ever solely produced by Cudi himself, samples his 2010 song "". On July 10, 2012 via his Twitter feed, Cudi announced collaborations on the album thus far, as the album had not yet been completed, to be Pusha T, Jaden Smith and Kendrick Lamar, along with more familiar collaborators Kanye West, King Chip, and Cage. He also revealed he was hoping to collaborate with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Diplo and MGMT. In September, he had also expressed interest in working with Harlem-bred rapper ASAP Rocky on "Indicud". On October 1, 2012 Cudi confirmed that production from electronic rock duo Ratatat, with whom he collaborated on "Pursuit of Happiness" and "Alive" from his debut album "" (2009), would be featured on "Indicud".
On October 9 and 12, Cudi released pictures of him and Dot da Genius in the studio working on the album. On November 6, 2012, Cudi made it known that he was in the studio that day working with fellow American rapper J. Cole. On November 17, 2012, via his Twitter feed, Cudi announced the song he recorded with Kendrick Lamar was produced by himself and is titled "Solo Dolo, Part II". He also stated his former GOOD Music label-mate Common would be featured on the album, on a song produced by Dot da Genius and Cudi's mentor 88-Keys. On February 13, 2013, via Twitter, Cudi revealed he previewed the album to friend and fellow American actor, Mark Webber, and asked him to share his thoughts on the album, as a favor to the fans. During his barrage of tweets, Webber gave insight on the album, revealing Too Short and Wu-Tang Clan's RZA as features, as well as praising Cudi's production, rapping and singing. Unlike his previous albums, "Indicud" is primarily produced by Cudi himself.
In an interview with "Billboard", released March 2013, Cudi confirmed he was working closely with ASAP Rocky, while also revealing Haim, an all-female indie rock band, would appear on the album on a song produced by high-profile American record producer Hit-Boy and himself. On April 2, 2013 Hit-Boy, claimed besides Cudi, he was the only other person to provide production on the album. Cudi later confirmed the statement via Twitter. Cudi and Hit-Boy had been working on the aforementioned song since January 2011. The track is also the first record the two of them ever worked on together.
Production.
Cudi also incorporated quotes from his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film "Billy Madison": "That’s one of my favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' So there had to be a way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on "Billy Madison" and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'"
With "Indicud", on several tracks Cudi took a backseat in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. "The focus was on producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off more than anything else and that's why I had my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." As for the A$AP Rocky feature on "Brothers," Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo."
Release and promotion.
On October 28, 2012, after previously announcing hopes of releasing the album in late 2012, Cudi changed the estimate release date from late 2012 to early 2013. In late November, Cudi made it known he would be withholding the album's exact release date, until it was certain, to avoid push backs. On December 18, 2012, the same day promotional single "King Wizard" was officially released, Cudi revealed the album would be released in March 2013. On February 12, he announced the album's release date to be April 23, 2013. After the album leaked online in its entirety on April 9, 2013, Kid Cudi decided to push the album's release date up to April 16.
In early January, the album was named the ninth most anticipated album of 2013 by "Complex" and the 14th most anticipated album by "XXL". In early 2013, Cudi covered Complex Magazine's February/March 2013 issue. In January 2013, Cudi took to Twitter to express his frustrations with record label, Universal Republic, not supporting and promoting his music. After providing facts about singles "Just What I Am" and "King Wizard", defending their strong online presence and lamenting about not getting radio play, Cudi tweeted, "if things dont change soon, theres gonna be some problems."
On March 14, 2013 Kid Cudi performed at MySpace's South by Southwest (SXSW) secret show in Austin, Texas and after performing his many hits, he previewed a new verse from "Indicud". He also revealed that the album would feature 18 tracks, while officially confirming ASAP Rocky and Michael Bolton as featured guests. On March 16, Cudi announced that he would release the album's tracklist and cover art on April 2. Three days later, Kid Cudi announced via Twitter that the album had officially been completed and turned in to his label, Universal Republic. On March 26, the album's cover art and tracklist was unveiled by Walmart and later "Complex". After the album cover's unveiling, Cudi took to Twitter to explain his decision for the artwork: "The album art represents me. A ball of flames in a rose gold frame." The cover's art direction was handled by Cudi himself. In December 2013, it would be named the sixteenth best album cover of 2013 by "Complex". Later that day, Cudi appeared on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and performed the album's lead singles; "Just What I Am" and "Immortal", as well as premiering "Mad Solar", which he performed a cappella.
During late 2013, Kid Cudi toured in support of "Indicud" on The Cud Life Tour 2013. The tour was announced on July 15, with tickets going on sale the following day. Supporting acts on the tour include Big Sean, Tyler, The Creator and Logic. The tour took place in the United States beginning on August 22 and ran through October 18, 2013.
Singles.
On August 12, 2012 Kid Cudi released the lead single from "Indicud", a song titled "Just What I Am", featuring his longtime collaborator and friend, fellow Cleveland rapper King Chip. On October 2, 2012, "Just What I Am", was released to iTunes as the first single from the album. The single's music video, which marked Cudi's directorial debut, was released November 6, 2012, via Kid Cudi's Vevo. The song has since peaked at number 74 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100.
On September 29, 2012, Cudi released a podcast where he previewed "King Wizard", a new song he was "very excited about". On October 3, 2012, one day after "Just What I Am", the album's lead single was officially released via iTunes, Cudi liberated "King Wizard" as the second offering from "Indicud" via SoundCloud. Cudi who also produced the track, had teamed up with Samsung Mobile to release the clean version of the newly mastered “King Wizard” as a free download. The download was available by heading to Samsung Mobile USA’s Facebook page under the “music” tab. The explicit version and the music video were officially released via iTunes, on December 18, 2012 as the album's second single.
On October 29, Cudi announced he would be releasing the album's second official single at the end of November. On November 7, he revealed the upcoming single's title to be "Immortal", and that it again was produced by himself like the two previous releases, "Just What I Am" and "King Wizard". He claimed the song "will make you feel amazing in the heart and soul." However, on November 30, he revealed "Immortal" would not be released until 2013. "Immortal" would be premiered on March 1, 2013 via SoundCloud. The song was produced by Cudi, with the main sample being a track from one of his favorite bands MGMT's, "Congratulations". He reversed the song, sped it up, and produced over it. The song was officially released via iTunes on March 14, 2013 as the album's third single.
On April 2, 2013 Cudi released "Girls" for digital download via the iTunes Store, as the album's fourth single. The song features fellow American rapper Too Short, and was produced by Cudi.

Critical response.
"Indicud" received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 58, which indicates mixed or average, based on 16 reviews. Chris Dart of "Exclaim!" said, "It's also a smart, fun, eclectic record full of psychedelic influences and great, massive choruses." Steve Jones of "USA Today" said, "Scott Mescudi handles the production of his third album, creating moody, surreal soundscapes to bolster rhymes that run the gamut of emotions. But whether he's feeling invincible or despondent, you get a true sense of where his head's at." David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, "It's an entertaining, vibrant, and artistically filling album, so consider it a "presents" effort and enjoy the show." Mosi Reeves of "Spin" said, "None of the guest actors here distract from Cudi's signature self-mythologizing and inner turmoil. And most of the time, it's his inner turmoil that beckons you in, rather than merely pushing you out." Dan Buyanovsky of "XXL" stated, "As a whole, Cudi’s version of "2001" is an original and bold project [...] This ambitious project does not fall flat, and credit is due to Cudi for continuing to challenge himself post-WZRD, taking on a new skill-set and concept rather than throwing together a collection of identically moody anthems."
Evan Rytlewski of "The A.V. Club" stated, "For the first time, Cudi is more interested in throwing an actual party than a pity party, and with his bass-engulfed beats and chewy, sing-along hooks, he’s well-suited to the task. In spite of its brighter outlook, though, "Indicud" is still a Kid Cudi record." Logan Smithson of PopMatters said, "If you've heard a Kid Cudi album before, you probably know what you’re going to get from "Indicud", and for those who have been patiently awaiting his latest release, that's great news. "Indicud" features some of Kid Cudi’s best songs to date, and is an overall enjoyable listen from start to finish." Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated, "It's ass-backwards to make other people look the best on your solo album. Still, that might demonstrate the path of Kid Cudi isn't about being a rapper, a singer, or something in between. The point is, this record just proves that Kid Cudi has a lot of sorting to do, and continuing down the same old path simply won’t cut it in the long-run." Joe Gross of "Rolling Stone" said, "Someday this Cleveland MC/producer/former weed enthusiast will find the lyrical and vocal charisma to match the scrumptiously dark, quasi-industrial tenor of his moody beats. But Cudi’s pitchy-dawg voice remains his own worst enemy."
Accolades.
Closing out the year, the album was named to multiple album of the year lists. "Complex" ranked the album at number 26, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, "the album's cinematic feel puts Cudi in the director's seat as he compiles a diverse ensemble cast of luminaries, ranging from rap legends like RZA to indie rockers like Haim to West Coast spitters like Kendrick Lamar. The final product is proof Cudi can make a soundscape that others can easily adapt to, not the other way around." "XXL" positioned it at number 25 on their list of the best albums of 2013. In December 2013, HipHopDX placed it on their list of the top 25 albums of the year saying, "In a manner akin to Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil to become a magician of a bluesman, Kid Cudi also clearly sold his soul to the demons that once claimed it in order to craft this album. There’s no singles here, just an intense and very listenable journey." "The Source" ranked it at number 23 on their list, saying "it delivered, sonically and conceptually. The album was an honest representation of the maturation of Cudi’s space age sound and middle finger to the world attitude."
