930th Operations Group

The 930th Operations Group is an inactive United States Air Force Reserve unit. It was last active with the 434th Wing, based at Grissom Air Reserve Base, Indiana. It was inactivated on 1 October 1994.
History.
Following the mobilizations in 1961 and 1962 for the Berlin Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Continental Air Command (ConAC) realized that it was unwieldy to mobilize an entire wing unless absolutely necessary. Their original Table of Organization for each Wing was a wing headquarters, a troop carrier group, an Air Base Group, a maintenance and supply group, and a medical group. In 1957, the troop carrier group and maintenance and supply groups were inactivated, with their squadrons reassigned directly to the wing headquarters - despite the fact that many wings had squadrons spread out over several bases due to the Detached Squadron Concept dispersing Reserve units over centers of population.
To resolve this, in late 1962 and early 1963, ConAC reorganized the structure of its reserve Troop Carrier Wings by establishing fully deployable Troop Carrier Groups and inserting them into the chain of command between the Wing and its squadrons at every base that held a ConAC troop carrier squadron. At each base, the group was composed of a material squadron, a troop carrier squadron, a tactical hospital or dispensary, and a combat support squadron. Each troop carrier wing consisted of 3 or 4 of these groups. By doing so, ConAC could facilitate the mobilization of either aircraft and aircrews alone, aircraft and minimum support personnel (one troop carrier group), or the entire troop carrier wing. This also gave ConAC the flexibility to expand each Wing by attaching additional squadrons, if necessary from other Reserve wings to the deployable groups for deployments.
As a result, the 930th Troop Carrier Group was established with a mission to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations.
The group was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 434th TCW in 1963, the others being the 931st Troop Carrier Group, at Bakalar AFB, Indiana and the 932d Troop Carrier Group at Scott AFB, Illinois.
The 930th performed routine reserve airlift operations until 13 May 1968 when the group was activated for combat duty in the Vietnam War. The 71st TAS's C-119 aircraft were selected for modification to the AC-119G Shadow Gunship configuration with powerful searchlights and rapid-fire machine guns. The 71st TAS was reassigned to Lockbourne AFB, Ohio on 1 June for training, and later deployed to Nha Trang AB, South Vietnam later in 1968. With its operational squadron reassigned, the 930th was inactivated.
Special Operations.
With the re-designated 71st Special Operations Squadron returning from service in South Vietnam in 1969, the Group was re-organized in the Air Force Reserve and equipped with the squadrons returning AC-119Gs. It was re-activated on 10 June 1969 as the 930th Special Operations Group, with the 71st being assigned as its operational flying squadron. It was assigned to the 302d Tactical Airlift Wing at Bakalar AFB, although with the pending closure of Bakalar AFB, the unit was moved to the active-duty Grissom AFB later in June.
The group provided AC-119 gunship training for pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and mechanics of USAF active units and personnel from Jordan, Morocco, Ethiopia, and South Vietnam until the end of 1970 when the Shadow gunships were retired by the Air Force.
On 1 June 1970, the Air Force Reserve activated the 434th Special Operations Wing (434 SOW) at Grissom AFB, and the 930th was returned to its original wing, albeit with a new mission. On 15 January 1971, the group received A-37B Dragonfly counter-insurgency aircraft being returned from South Vietnam. The A-37s were primarily an export aircraft used for foreign military sales and the 71st SOS trained personnel from other Air Force Reserve squadrons and Latin American Air Forces in the use of the aircraft.
The 71st SOS was inactivated on 1 October 1973, and was replaced by the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron in a reorganization. The 45th TFS was assigned directly to the re-designed 434th Tactical Fighter Wing, and the 930th SOG was placed in a non-operational status. On 1 July 1975 it was inactivated.
Tactical Fighter.
Re-activated a third time in 1987 as the 930th Tactical Fighter Group, and equipped with A-10 Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft. Trained reserve personnel in close air support, anti-armor, battlefield air interdiction, and combat search and rescue missions.
In 1992, the group was transferred back to its original 434th wing again part of the transition of the 434th Air Refueling Wing to the objective organization plan. It was re-designated as the 930th Operations Group under the 434th Wing, being the fighter component of the now composite wing. However, the post-Cold War era cutbacks were the order of the day, and the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) directed realignment of Grissom AFB to the Air Force Reserve as an air refueling base. The 930th OG was ordered inactivated and its A-10 aircraft were reassigned to other units.
The 45th FS was inactivated on 30 September 1994; the 930th OG the next day on 1 October.

Big Dome

The Big Domes were a fleet of streamlined dome cars built by the Budd Company for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ("Santa Fe") in 1954. Budd built a total of 14 cars in two batches. The Santa Fe operated all 14 on various streamlined trains until it conveyed its passenger trains to Amtrak in 1971. The Santa Fe retained one as a business car and sold the remaining 13 to the Auto-Train Corporation, which operated them for another ten years. All but two have been preserved in varying condition.
Design.
The Santa Fe had previously ordered six "Pleasure Domes" from Pullman-Standard for use on the "Super Chief". These were first-class lounges, with parlor car-style swivel chairs in the dome area and a private dining room on the lower level. These were "short domes": the dome was centered and did not extend the full length of the car.
For the new Big Domes the Santa Fe and Budd went in a different direction. Like the Super Domes which Pullman had built two years previously for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad ("Milwaukee Road"), these were "full-length" domes: the dome extended the entire length of the car. The top level featured coach-style seating for 57, plus a lounge area which could seat an additional 18 on sofas and in booths. The lower level came in two variations. The first eight (numbered 506–513) featured a cocktail lounge and nurses' room. The second six (numbered 550–555) had a smaller bar-lounge and crew dormitory. Much of the lower area in both configurations was given over to mechanical use, including air-conditioning. The cocktail lounge was decorated in a "unique Indian decor", a common motif on the Santa Fe.
When the Auto-Train Corporation purchased 13 of the Big Domes in 1971 it renovated the interiors. Reclining seats replaced the fixed seating, reducing capacity to 51. Two cars had their upper-lounge areas rebuilt as "night clubs."
Service history.
The Santa Fe took delivery of all 14 domes between January and May 1954. Contemporary advertisements touted the Big Domes as "the world's most beautiful railroad car." The cocktail-lounge Big Domes were assigned to the "El Capitan", "Chicagoan", and "Kansas Cityan", while the lounge-dormitory domes went to the brand-new "San Francisco Chief". The assignment to the "El Capitan" proved short-lived: already in 1954 the Santa Fe operated two prototype Hi-Level coaches on the "El Capitan", and completely re-equipped it with those cars in 1956. The Big Domes moved to the "Chief", where they remained until that train's cancellation in 1968. Their final home on the Santa Fe was the "Texas Chief".
Amtrak retained the "Texas Chief" but did not purchase any of the Big Domes. They continued on the "Texas Chief" until September 1971, when the Santa Fe sold all but one to the new Auto-Train Corporation. After Auto-Train's bankruptcy in 1981 the fleet was broken up. Two (#550 and #555) have since been scrapped. The remainder are privately owned.

Treaties to recognise the Spanish American independence

After the Cádiz Cortes of 1810 many Spanish Empire colonies decided to declare independence. King Ferdinand VII of Spain refused to accept these declarations and promised that he would retake all the territories, by force if necessary. There were diplomatic negotiations during the Trienio Liberal (1820-1823) but they were quashed by the return of absolutism. Ferdinand VII died in 1833, ending all military projects to reconquest Spanish America. In 1834 the Regnant Queen Isabella II of Spain decided that times had changed, that a more modern approach was needed, and started consulting other members of her government. In December 16, 1836 the Congress of Spain issued a decree authorizing the Spanish Government to renounce its territorial and sovereign claims over its domains in continental Americas, by concluding treaties with each of the states of Spanish America. Throughout the 19th century Spain made treaties of peace and recognition with each of newborn states. The process was less conflictive than the government thought, but several diplomatic hurdles meant that 68 years passed until the last treaty was signed.

Mihály Csáky (chancellor)

Mihály Csáky "or Csáki" de Mihály (c. 1492 – May 1572) was a Hungarian noble in the Principality of Transylvania, who served as the first Chancellor of Transylvania from 1556 to 1571.
Early career.
He was born into a lower noble family around 1492. His father, István Csáky (Csáki) participated in the Diet of 1505 as envoy of Sopron County. Mihály studied at the University of Kraków, with the subsidization of his distant relative, Bishop of Transylvania János Gosztonyi between 1521 and 1525. His fellow students were, including, Matthias Dévay, Márton Sánta de Kálmáncsehi and János Károlyi. After that he chosen the ecclesiastical career and served in, according to his biographer, Zsigmond Jakó, John Sigismund Zápolya's royal court. He became canon of Gyulafehérvár (today: "Alba Iulia, Romania") in 1539. He served as deputy vice bishop and dean of Kraszna County since 1543, then episcopal vicar from 1545. He was the dean of Hunyad County in 1549. During that time, he befriended Antal Verancsics (). Csáky succeeded him in the position of secretary of Queen Isabella Jagiellon in 1549.
Mihály Csáky was a member of the royal council of twelve members between 1548 and 1551 which was attached to George Martinuzzi (). The Diet of Torda (today: "Turda, Romania") in 1548 established the council to limit the power of the Frater. Martinuzzi was hostile to him, because Csáky was a partisan of Isabella, on the other hand the councilor gradually tilted towards, in spite of his former position at the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran doctrine. Chronicler Mathias Miles recorded that Martinuzzi applied severe punishment against Mihály Csáky, who violated the fasting on Friday: he tied rabbit and chicken to Csáky's naked body and released the hounds. Besides his office of councilor he served as secretary for the prince between 1549 and 1550. He was the educator of the child John Sigismund too. After the Treaty of Nyírbátor, adherents of the queen and Martinuzzi faced each other. In this spirit, the bishop tried to arrest Csáky on charges of abuse of power. Later Martinuzzi also raised murder of Csáky in 1550.
Chancellor of Transylvania.
Organization of the state structure.
In 1551, Mihály Csáky traveled to the Kingdom of Poland as a member of the queen's escort. Meanwhile, Martinuzzi was murdered in December 1551. Ferdinand I tried to persuade Csáky to join to his court, but without any success. When Isabella and his son, John Sigismund returned to home in 1556, Csáky began to create the Transylvanian Chancellery, which had been advocated formerly by the Diet of Kolozsvár (today: "Cluj-Napoca, Romania") in 1550. Acorrding to his plans, the Chancellery consisted of two parts: the "cancellaria maior" ("Greater Chancellery") dealt with the affairs of the foreign and internal government under the authority of the Chancellor, while the "cancellaria minor" ("Lesser Chancellery"), headed by two masters of judgement, arranged the judicial cases of Transylvania and the Partium.
After the death of Queen Isabella (1559), Csáky maintained his position of chancellor and councilor besides John Sigismund. He became the most powerful magnate of Transylvania. He did his work mostly remaining in the background, he controlled the diplomacy, the jurisdiction through the ecclesiastical affairs. Sometimes he was also responsible for the finances of the principality, when the office of master of the treasury fell vacant. His successor, Ferenc Forgách described him as "almighty'. Csáky did not participating in armed conflicts, but he had also influence over military affairs. After the betrayal of Menyhért Balassa, Csáky was the one who precluded more serious consequences with a good organization.
Ecclesiastical policy.
He had a prominent role in the establishing of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary. He supported Gáspár Heltai's efforts to translation into Hungarian language of the Bible with large amount of money. Csáky was a dedicated follower of the Lutheranism in the second phase of his life, but is not known precisely when he converted to Lutheranism from Roman Catholicism. According to some foreign envoys, he assumed office in the Lutheran Church too.
Csáky became a follower of the Antitrinitarian (or Unitarian) doctrines, after the Disputes of 1568 in Gyulafehérvár. Some chronicles attributed major role to him that John Sigismund converted to Unitarianism, but that fact is disputed.
Aftermath and legacy.
John Sigismund died suddenly in 1571, four days after the ratification of the Treaty of Speyer. After the election of voivode Stephen Báthory (who later became Prince of Transylvania and King of Poland), Mihály Csáky lost his office and all of his political influence.
According the contemporaries, he was a very stingy and violent man. He collected a huge fortune towards the end of his life: he acquired the estates of the extinct Czibak family in Bihar County and the Huszt Castle. His property was inherited by his nephews.
Mihály Csáky died in May 1572 at Gyulafehérvár, the capital of the Principality of Transylvania.

Cornelius Berenberg

Cornelius Berenberg (1634 – 1711) was a Hamburg grand burgher, merchant banker, a member of the Berenberg family, and owner of Berenberg Bank. His grandfather Hans Berenberg (1561–1626) had fled from Antwerp with his brother Paul Berenberg (1566–1645) and established the Berenberg merchant house in Hamburg. In Hamburg, the Berenberg family formed part of the Dutch merchant colony. Cornelius Berenberg was the first to engage in merchant banking. He developed the company into a very successful merchant house and merchant bank, and forged trade links with France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Scandinavia and Russia. Family connections of the Berenbergs were instrumental to the development, especially in Livorno and Lisbon with its colonies of wealthy Dutch merchants.
His father was Hans Berenberg (1593–1640) and his mother was Adelheid Ruhlant (1611–1684), a daughter of the advocate Rütger Ruhlant (1568–1630) who had been ennobled by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1622, and Catarina de Greve (1582–1655).
He was married to Anna Margaretha Colin (1649–1684), daughter of Daniel Colin (1615–1660) and Elisabeth Adelheid Engels (1620–1659). His son was Senator and banker Rudolf Berenberg.

<doc id="36815492" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36815492" title="NEST (software)">
NEST (software)

NEST is a simulation software for spiking neural network models, including large-scale neuronal networks. NEST was initially developed by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig and is now developed and maintained by the NEST Initiative.
Modeling philosophy.
A NEST simulation tries to follow the logic of an electrophysiological experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the neural system to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter.
The neural system is defined by a possibly large number of neurons and their connections. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two neurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not be described by a weight or connectivity matrix but rather as an adjacency list.
To manipulate or observe the network dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for measuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to memory or to file.
NEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added.
Example.
The following example simulates spiking activity in a sparse random network with recurrent excitation and inhibition
The figure shows the spiking activity of 50 neurons as a raster plot. Time increases along the horizontal axis, neuron id increases along the vertical axis. Each dot corresponds to a spike of the respective neuron at a given time. The lower part of the figure shows a histogram with the mean firing-rate of the neurons.
Features.
NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focus on the dynamics, size, and structure of neural systems, rather than on the exact geometry of individual neurons.
Examples of such models are:
History.
NEST development was started in 1993 by Markus Diesmann and Marc-Oliver Gewaltig at the Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. At this time, the simulator was called SYNOD and simulations were defined in a stack based simulation language, called SLI.
In 2001, the software changed its name from SYNOD to NEST. Until 2004, NEST was exclusively developed and used by the founding members of the NEST Initiative. The first public release appeared in summer 2004. Since then, NEST was released regularly, about once or twice per year.
Since 2007, NEST supports hybrid parallelism, using POSIX threads and MPI.
In 2008, the stack-based simulation language SLI was superseded by a modern Python interface, however, the old simulation language is still used internally.
At the same time, the simulator independent specification language PyNN was developed with support for NEST.
In 2012, the NEST Initiative changed the license from the proprietary NEST License to GNU GPL V2 or later.

Lynch Architects

Lynch Architects, formed in 1998 by Patrick Lynch, is a London-based practice. The directors are Patrick Lynch, Claudia Lynch and David Evans. Lynch Architects was awarded the Young Architect of the Year Award in 2005, and co-represented Ireland at the 2008 Venice Architecture Biennale. The practice was selected by Sir David Chipperfield to exhibit at the 2012 Biennale.
The practice’s early reputation was established through exhibitions and writing as much as its built work. In 2001, Patrick Lynch, who gained degrees at the universities of Liverpool and Cambridge, exhibited small scale built interventions in existing structures in London and other speculative projects at the ‘Encounters Between Here and There’ show at London’s Architecture Foundation.
The practice’s first internationally recognised project was a 2003 country house, Marsh View, Norfolk. The practice has since developed its design reputation at a range of scales, from major commercial projects, landscape interventions, housing, memorial sculpture, and a bronze door handle for the manufacturer, Izé.
Lynch Architects’ work has been reviewed by critics and writers including Ken Powell; Ellis Woodman; Kieran Long; Jonathan Bell and Ellie Stathaki, The New Modern House: Redefining Functionalism, Laurence King, London, 2010; and Joachim Fischer and Chris van Uffelen.
Design influences.
Lynch Architects' creative inspiration includes the work of architects such as Sigurd Lewerentz, Alvaro Siza, Luigi Moretti, Francesco Borromini, and Michelangelo. Equally important to Lynch’s design are the writings of his key teachers, Dalibor Veseley, Joseph Rykwert, and Peter Carl. 
In an article entitled Measuring Matter and Memory, Lynch cites the writings of the American artist Robert Irwin to support his idea of creativity as mental topography, and the role that imagination plays in forgetting the name of the thing that is seen.
Selected projects.
The practice’s first significant project, Marsh View in the wetlands of Norfolk, remodeled a bungalow to create a two-level house whose unusual form was anchored to a mound-like chimney corner. The building suggests an archaic mode of inhabitation, based around a hearth or temple. 
The Kingsgate House scheme in Victoria, for developers Land Securities, will replace a massive slab-block in central London with two new buildings and urban landscaping. The articulated form and crafted detail of the mixed-use buildings includes elements by two artists, Rut Blees Luxemburg and Joel Tomlin.
The Victoria Public Library, also for Land Securities, is part of a development called Victoria Circle, with other buildings by Benson and Forsyth and PLP. Lynch’s design proposal sits beside the listed 19th century Victoria Palace Theatre and includes affordable housing as well as the library, and a small office block that involves the reconstruction of a listed façade. The project will accommodate sculptures by a number of artists, including Hilary Koob-Sassen.
The design of the Madder 139 Gallery in Clerkenwell, London, converted two Georgian terrace houses, into galleries on the ground floor and in a double-height basement and rear courtyard. 
Lynch Architects contributed a 36-house scheme to the development masterplan for Brent Cross and Cricklewood drawn up by Allies and Morrison. Lynch’s design expresses a modern, strongly anti-pastiche interpretation of Georgian terraced housing. 
The practice’s competition-winning scheme for Barking Abbey Green will create a series of structures whose abstracted forms are derived from the deeper history of the site. Their competition design for the Giant’s Causeway Visitor Centre expressed recent history, geography, ancient myths and geological time. Lynch Architects have also been shortlisted to design an intervention that will accentuate the presence of Westminster Cathedral’s piazza.
Teaching and writing.
Patrick Lynch has taught at the Architectural Association, University College Dublin, London Metropolitan University and Kingston University, and lectured at the Cooper Union in New York, the Casa da Musica, Porto, and the University of Pennsylvania. His written work includes the book ‘The Theatricality of the Baroque City: The Zwinger and Dresden’; a chapter in ‘Why do architects love his buildings? Jim Stirling and the Red Trilogy: Three Radical Buildings’; and the long essay ‘Everything Flows: The Architecture of O’Donnell & Tuomey’.

Netru Indru

Netru Indru (English: Yesterday Today) is a 2014 Tamil thriller film, directed by Padmamagan, a filmmaker who earlier directed "Pallavan" and R. Parthiban starrer "Ammuvagiya Naan". Prasanna and Vimal, along with Richard Rishi and Bharani of "Naadodigal" fame, played the lead roles, while Arundhati and Manochitra were the female leads. Rehhan scored the music for the film, while Dinesh Sre was the cinematographer. Shot entirely in forests of South India, "Netru Indru" draws a parallel between events happened in the past and ones that happens in the present in the forest. Produced by S. Malathy, it was expected to hit the screens in August 2013, but it did not release on the projected release date but after several delays in June 2014.
Production.
In August 2012, it was reported that director Padmamagan was starting a new film titled "Koothu" with Vimal and Prasanna in the lead. The director claimed that it was not "a run of the mill love story" but a thriller with a "unique screenplay". He further stated, ""Koothu" is a green journey in my life amid rocks and isolated forests with no human approach. We were in dense jungles to conduct shooting for "Koothu". It is an extravaganza of nature's bounty." Alongside Vimal and Prasanna, upcoming actors Richard, Bharani, Harish and Nithish were part of the principal cast, while Manochitra (then named Nandhagi) and Arundhathi were signed as the female leads.
The film was shot in 65 days in the dense forests around the border of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Filming locations include places such as Malabar Coast, south Deccan Plateaus, Western Ghats mountain rain forests, Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry.
The film's trailer was released in August 2012 and after a period of inactivity, the title was changed in March 2013 from "Koothu" to "Netru Indru" and an audio launch function was held. Prasanna revealed that Vimal had forgone his salary for the film, as a result of the producer's financial problems. The film received an A certificate from the Censor Board, with the director stating, "For commercial value, we wanted heroines for the film. Once we got them on board, the glamour quotient went a bit out of hand. But the whole thing suited the story very well than we expected. So we decided not to compromise the film by taking a U certificate".
Soundtrack.
Music was composed by Rehaan who earlier composed for the film "Vannathupoochi".
Critical reception.
The Times of India gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Every once in a while, there comes a film that makes you go 'Am I really seeing this?' and "Netru Indru" is that kind of film — a film so bad that it's good. It is unashamedly crass, exploitative and downright sexist". Indiaglitz.com gave it 2 out of 5 and wrote, "Perhaps to compensate the lack of other commercial elements the director has rested his stakes on sleaze, sex and skin show. Despite...inadequacies and inconsistencies and being not suitable at all for viewing with family, "Netru Indru" cannot be termed as a bad movie. The different premise and non-linear narration that does not breed boredom saves the show".

It became one of the flagship programs of the Ramos government and by 1995, the Casecnan Project got approved for construction. In September 2001, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo finally opened the diversion tunnel after two years after the Phase I of the Casecnan project was done. In 2012, the Aquino government approved the construction of the second phase of the Casecnan project.
Power generation.
When the Ramos government approved the start of the Casecnan project, the constructed power plant was planned to have produced 150 megawatts. However, it only produced 140 megawatts after the power plant began operation.
Irrigation.
The original output for irrigation of Casecnan was the irrigation of around of farmland. It currently irrigates in Nueva Ecija and in Pampanga. The Aquino government laid seven billion pesos to further enlarge the irrigation capacity of Casecnan which was planned to irrigate an additional of land in Nueva Ecija and another in Pampanga by its completion in 2016.

Kamiyodo Haiji

Temple complex.
The compound includes a kondō that measures east to west by north to south. Unusually, the foundations of three pagodas have been identified to the east of the kondō, arranged from north to south. The site of what appears from its size, foundation stone, and fallen tiles to have been a further, three-storey pagoda has been uncovered to the west of the kondō. Behind were a number of further buildings. 5,500 fragments of wall painting and 3,300 fragments of sculpture were recovered from the site, together with a large quantity of roof tiles and items of iron and bronze.
Wall paintings.
Among the fragments of painting are the heads of a heavenly general and bodhisattva, a cuirass, sections of robe, flowers, grasses, lotus petals, part of a decorated canopy, and a mountain with three peaks emerging from the clouds, the precursor of later landscape painting. The paintings were executed upon an earthen render, the lower layer comprising clay and chopped straw, the upper more sandy soil with finer vegetable fibres; the surface was prepared for painting with a white clay ground. The range of pigments as much as the subject matter shows the impact of foreign culture from the mainland: unlike the limited pallette of the decorated tombs before the introduction of Buddhism, the painting fragments show the use of vermilion, red ochre, minium, yellow ochre, massicot, malachite, azurite, white clay, and lampblack ink.
Preservation.
An area of encompassing the excavations was designated a National Historic Site in 1996. In 2006/2007 the site was relandscaped at a cost of ¥111.3 million. In 2009 the excavated artefacts were designated a Prefectural Tangible Cultural Property. The nearby Kamiyodo Hakuhō-no-Oka Exhibition Hall opened in 2011; exhibits include fragments of the wall paintings and a reconstruction of the interior of the kondō complete with paintings and sculptures. The fragments of painting themselves have been consolidated with an epoxy resin.
Early temple wall painting.
Initially the paintings, understood to be coeval with the construction of the kondō in the late Asuka period (end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century), were hailed as the earliest temple mural painting in Japan, alongside the wall paintings of the Hōryū-ji kondō. During excavation in 2004 of the Wakakusa-garan, however, the old Hōryū-ji complex before the 670 fire, hundreds of fragments of wall painting dating to the first half of the seventh century were unearthed, with heat-induced pigment alteration. Two fragments of fire-damaged plaster recovered from excavations of Yamada-dera in 1978 have also been recently attributed to a wall painting, of mid-seventh century date. Late Asuka-period wall paintings are now known from in Takashima, Shiga. Fragments of red plaster have also been recovered from the site of the pagoda of Daikandai-ji, constructed in 698 and destroyed by fire in 711. Wall paintings of a similar date were uncovered in the five-storey pagoda of Hōryū-ji in the 1940s; these suggest the use of stencils and have been designated an Important Cultural Property.

List of languages by type of grammatical genders

This article lists languages depending on their approach to grammatical gender.
No grammatical gender.
Certain language families, such as the Austronesian, Turkic and Uralic language families have no grammatical gender (see genderless language).
Animate and inanimate.
In many such languages, what is commonly termed "animacy" may in fact be more accurately described as a distinction between human and non-human, rational and irrational, "socially active" and "socially passive" etc.
Masculine, feminine, and neuter.
Note. In Slavic languages marked with an asterisk (*), traditionally only "masculine", "feminine" and "neuter" genders are recognized, with "animacy" as a separate category for the masculine; the actual situation is similar to Czech and other Slavic languages, so they may be analyzed as four-gender languages as well.

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review, stating:
Lady Oo sing-speaks over an earworm hook of electronic reverb and bouncy brass that's as bonkers as it is addictive. While parts of the track may sound like Basil Brush attempting his best Bjork impression at the staff BBQ, it results in a bizarrely catchy tune that we'll all pretend isn't on our iPods for years to come.

Wolgast Castle

Wolgast Castle was a Castle in the city of Wolgast in the northeast of today's Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It was located on a small barrier island in the Peenestrom, the strait which separates Usedom island from the mainland. The island is still called "Castle Island". The castle was one of the most important Renaissance buildings in Northern Germany. It existed from 1496, when it replaced an earlier castle on the island, until it was demolished in the 1820s. After is was demolished, the materials were used to constrcut other building, so no ruins exist. Only a few items from the castle have been preserved in various exhibitions.

Anybody who loves music should check this album out straight away, from this fantastic and genuinely creative musician, something that sadly is sometimes lost in the money grabbing, image obsessed music industry today." 
During the production of "Shire and City" Duthie commissioned an artwork piece which explored the urban myth that Bram Stoker used Slains Castle in Cruden Bay as an inspiration for Dracula (novel).

Sigma Beauty

Sigma Beauty (also known as Sigma) is an international cosmetics company, selling brushes, makeup, skin care and accessories.
History.
Sigma was founded in 2008 by Brazilian natives Simone Oliveira Xavier and her husband, Rene Xavier Filho, in their basement in New Brighton, Minnesota. They serve as Executive Creative Director and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. Oliveira, a former veterinarian who holds a PhD in infectious diseases, was previously working as a clinical professor at the University of Minnesota. She received two patents in the field of swine medicine. Filho is a civil engineer and longtime entrepreneur.
The couple, who moved to Minnesota in 1999, combined their knowledge of engineering and scientific research to pioneer the company, which began as a way to simply export American cosmetics to family members in Brazil. Seeing an opening to expand, Oliveira and Filho quickly grew the business, designing brushes and sending products to influential fashion bloggers.
Products.
Sigma’s brushes and kits are designed in the United States. Some of their items include the Dry ‘n Shape, a patent-pending brush care product that dries and reshapes brushes 4 to 6 hours after cleaning them; a vegan line of brushes made with synthetic fibers, for improved makeup application; and a patent-pending glove one can use to wash brushes. Their products have been recommended by American beauty magazines and websites like "Glamour" and xoJane.com, as well as international outlets such as "Folha de S. Paulo" and Shine Latina from "Yahoo!" Kim Kardashian’s makeup artist, Mario Dedivanovic, has said that Sigma’s are one of his favorite lines of brushes, and that he and Kardashian love the Sigma extravaganza body brush in particular.
Store.
In December 2012, Sigma opened its first physical store in the Mall of America in Minnesota, the most visited shopping mall in the US annually. The store sells Sigma brushes, kits and makeup.
Financial.
Sigma increased its sales every year from 2009 to 2012, and expects to increase by nearly 50% in 2013. They have over 13,000 online affiliates, who earn a commission by generating sales of Sigma products from new customers through links on social networking sites. The company ships products to over 150 different countries; as of 2012, 60% of the company’s revenue is earned overseas. It has been called “one of the fastest-growing companies in the beauty industry.”

Laznia Centre for Contemporary Art

The "Łaźnia" Centre for Contemporary Art is a municipal cultural institution and art gallery in the Dolne Miasto district of Gdańsk, Poland, located in the abandoned municipal bathhouse. The word "łaźnia" means "bathhouse" in Polish.
History of the building.
The municipal bathhouse was built in 1905, including recreational and sports facilities (a three-storey brick building with a basement, 2 floors, an attic and a partial cellar). In the original building there were shower units, bath rooms and sanitary rooms and on the second floor there was a gym. The building performed its function from the end of World War II up to the 1970s. In the latter period the building was converted into a ‘Location for Sanitary Procedures’ used by the Civil defence. In reality it was a place for deactivation of personal radioactive contamination for the Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant. In 1987 the bathhouse was put out of operation due to a poor technical condition and scheduled for a complete renovation. In 1989 renovation was stopped due to the lack of funds. The building was left empty and fell into gradual ruin.
History of the art centre.
First exhibitions in the building of the bathhouse took place in 1992 on the initiative of students of the Academy of Fine Arts (:pl:Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Gdańsku) and artists associated with the Wyspa Gallery. At the same time artists attempted to create there a permanent institution for presentation of contemporary art. After various changes of concepts the institution was founded in 1998, according to the project of art critic Aneta Szyłak and professor of the Acacdemy of Fine Arts Grzegorz Klaman as the Łaźnia Centre for Contemporary Art and received financing from the city budget.
The directors of "Laznia" were Aneta Szyłak (1998-2001), Małgorzata Lisiewicz (2001-2003), Jadwiga Charzyńska (2003-current).
Łaźnia II.
"Łaźnia II" is an extension of Łaźnia CCA, established as part of the district revitalization program in the Novy Port district of Gdansk. It is also to be located in a former bathhouse, by 5 Dockers' Strike Street.

Over My Dead Body (song)

"Over My Dead Body" is a song by Canadian rapper Drake from his second studio album, "Take Care" (2011). The song serves as the opening track from the album, and was written by Drake, Noah "40" Shebib, Anthony Palman and Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk; Shebib provided the song's production, with Kreviazuk providing co-production and additional vocals.
Background.
In 2010, following the success of his debut studio album "Thank Me Later", Drake revealed in an interview with MTV News that his second album would be titled "Take Care". He later confirmed he would continue to work extensively with longtime collaborator Noah "40" Shebib, who he wished to handle most of the production as he felt that "Thank Me Later"s sound had been too disparate, partly due to the large number of producers involved. He also noted in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that "Thank Me Later" had been "rushed", and that his new album's title of "Take Care" was partly attributed to the attitude he attempted to maintain whilst recording. The recording sessions for "Take Care" lasted for four months and largely took place in the city of Toronto, Ontario. During these sessions, Drake requested that Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk work with him on "Take Care" and perform on "Over My Dead Body": she described the album's creative process as "beautiful", and commented that she had felt "privileged to have lent my voice and melodic take on his fancy footwork".
Recording.
"Over My Dead Body" was written by Drake, Noah "40" Shebib, Anthony Palman and Chantal Kreviazuk, with Shebib providing the song's production. Kreviazuk provided additional vocals, and is also credited as the song's co-producer. Shebib also provided all of the song's instruments, except for additional piano, which was provided by Kreviazuk. "Over My Dead Body" was recorded by Shebib at Sterling Road Studios and Nightbird Studios – recording studios in Toronto, Ontario and Hollywood, California respectively. Mixing was performed by Noel Campbell at Studio 306 in Toronto, with assistant engineering carried out by Noel Cadastre. The song was mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. The song uses a sample of a remixed version of the song "Sailin' Da South" by American rapper E.S.G.: the remix was made by disc jockey DJ Screw for his 1995 album "3 'n the Mornin', Pt. 1".
Composition.
"Over My Dead Body" is the opening track on "Take Care", and lasts for a duration of 4 minutes and thirty-two seconds. Its "poignant" instrumentation is largely piano-driven, and contains influences of R&B and downtempo dance music, although it remains a primarily hip-hop song. Priya Elan of "NME" described the song as "emo-hop", and compared the backing track to the work of R&B singer and producer Frank Ocean. Writing for PopMatters, David Amidon noticed the use of low-pass filters in the instrumentation, and quipped that they allowed Drake to " between rapping and alto vocals more nimbly than ever".
Like many of the songs of "Take Care", "Over My Dead Body" addresses the struggles that fame and wealth bring. Throughout the song, although Drake boasts about his lifestyle on several occasions, his claims are often "undercut... with a tinge of sadness", in part due to the "poignant pianos and synth streaks" found in the production. The song's opening two couplets find Drake, according to Popdust writer Andrew Unterberger, "taking stock of where he's at" in his career, with the lyrics "I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man / Fuck it I was on though / And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club / Fuck it I was wrong though". Other lyrics, such as "just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states / used half of the money to beat my brother's case" see him taking on a "defiantly cocky" tone, which Rob Markman of MTV News claimed shows "how his success ultimately supports his people in the struggle". Unterberger interpreted the use of such lyrics as a response to those who had accused Drake of "dwelling too much in self-pity" in the material he had recorded earlier in his career.
Kreviazuk performs the song's chorus, in which she "plaintively" sings the words "they're trying to take you away from me / only over my dead body". Erika Ramirez of "Billboard" noticed that parts of the song make up a "mounting ode to his competition", highlighting the line "jealousy is just love and hate at the same time" as an example of this. Drake also discusses how taxes detract from his overall earnings; however, he "comforts himself" by surmising that "you lose some, you win some". The candid and open nature to much of "Over My Dead Body" is reminiscent of that found on "Fireworks", the opening track from "Thank Me Later" which featured vocals from singer Alicia Keys.
Reception.
"Over My Dead Body" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust called the song "a truly widescreen opener" to the album, and complimented Drake's "cockier" lyrics as a "good look for him", although he noted some of these lyrics to be a "little slow-clappy".
Credits and personnel.
The credits for "Over My Dead Body" are adapted from the liner notes of "Take Care".

Wei Feng

Wei Feng (died 219), courtesy name Zijing, was a government official who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty.
Life.
The "Shiyu" (世語) claimed that Wei Feng was from Pei commandery (沛郡; around present-day Pei County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu), but Wang Chang's "Jia Jie" (家誡) stated that he was from Jiyin commandery (濟陰郡; around present-day Heze, Shandong). He was recruited into the Han civil service by Zhong Yao and he served as an Assistant in the West Bureau (西曹掾). Before that, he was already known for his talent throughout Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), the capital of Cao Cao's vassal kingdom of Wei (魏; covering parts of present-day Hebei and Henan).
While in office, Wei Feng acquainted himself with many others, including: two of Wang Can's sons; Liu Wei (劉偉), a younger brother of Liu Yi (劉廙); Chen Yi (陳禕), the Minister of the Guards of Changle (長樂衞尉).
Around the ninth lunar month of 219, when Cao Cao was away on a campaign against Liu Bei in Hanzhong, Wei Feng plotted a rebellion in Ye together with Chen Yi and others. However, before the plan was carried out, Chen Yi became afraid and he reported the plot to Cao Pi, Cao Cao's heir apparent, who was in charge of Ye during his father's absence. Wei Feng and his accomplices, numbering dozens, were arrested and executed. Those who were implicated include: Zhong Yao, who recommended Wei Feng, was dismissed from his position as the Chancellor (相國) of Cao Cao's vassal kingdom; Wang Can's two sons, who were executed; Liu Wei, who was also executed. At least three persons had foreseen that Wei Feng would rebel: Liu Yi, who cautioned his younger brother against befriending Wei Feng; Fu Xun; Liu Ye, who also accurately predicted that Meng Da would rebel.

2012 Empire State Building shooting

On August 24, 2012, a gunman shot and killed a former co-worker outside the Empire State Building in New York City. Following the initial shooting, the gunman, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson, was fatally shot by police officers after raising his weapon at them. Nine bystanders were wounded by stray bullets fired by the officers and ricocheting debris, but none suffered life-threatening injuries.
Shooting.
On Friday, August 24, 2012, at approximately 9:03 a.m. EDT, at the 33rd Street side of the Empire State Building, Jeffrey Johnson, a clothing designer who had been laid off, emerged from hiding behind a van, pointed a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun at a former co-worker's head, and fired one round. Once the victim fell to the ground, Johnson stood over him and fired at him four more times, killing him. A coworker of the victim said she witnessed Johnson walk up to him and pull a gun out of his jacket.
After the shooting, Johnson concealed the handgun in a briefcase he was carrying, while pedestrians in the vicinity of the site of the shooting screamed and panicked. A construction worker followed him east on 33rd Street then north on 5th Avenue and alerted police officers who were stationed in front of the Empire State Building's 5th Avenue entrance. When confronted by the two officers, Johnson raised his weapon, but did not fire. The officers fired a total of 16 rounds, killing Johnson and injuring nine bystanders, none of whom suffered life-threatening wounds. Three of the bystanders were directly hit by police gunfire, while the rest of the injuries were caused by fragments of ricocheting bullets, or by debris from other objects hit by police. Johnson's handgun, which held eight rounds, still had two rounds remaining when he was shot, and extra ammunition was found inside his briefcase. A witness said people at the scene were shouting, "Get down! Get down!" and that the gunfire lasted about fifteen seconds.
The victims, five women and four men ranging in age from 20 to 43, were hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital Center, and NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. By Friday evening, six of the nine were treated and released from the hospitals. Eight victims were from New York City, and one woman was visiting from Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Perpetrator.
The perpetrator was 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson, a Manhattan resident, who was laid off from his job as a women's apparel designer at Hazan Imports at 10 E. 33rd St. about a year prior to the shootings, due to a downsizing of employees. He held his victim responsible for his resultant financial problems and police sources say he recently found out that he was being evicted from his apartment, which may have precipitated the shooting.
Johnson was born in Japan in 1953 to an American father and Japanese mother, and moved to the United States when he was 10 months old, where he grew up in Gainesville, Georgia. He had worked at the company for six years and lived alone in a walk-up apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side at the time of the attack. His building's superintendent and neighbors described him as a quiet and polite man who was seen every morning wearing a suit, greeting his neighbors and getting takeout from a nearby McDonald's, then usually remaining in his apartment for the rest of the day.
He had no known criminal record or history of psychiatric problems and the handgun used in the shooting was legally purchased in Sarasota, Florida in 1991, but he did not have a license to carry a handgun in New York City. He served in the United States Coast Guard from 1973 to 1977 and was honorably discharged with the rank of petty officer second class. Johnson attended the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida from 1978 to 1980, and owned a T-shirt design company entitled St. Jolly's Art. He was also involved with a community of birdwatching photographers who were interested in hawks in Central Park. His snapshots regularly appeared on blogs tracking the birds in the area.
Victim.
Police identified the co-worker victim as 41-year-old Steven Ercolino, a salesman who lived with his girlfriend in Union City, New Jersey and was a vice president at Hazan Imports. He was a 1992 graduate of the State University of New York at Oneonta. Ercolino's brother, Paul, said that Steven never mentioned having any problems with a co-worker and described him, along with others that knew him, as a gregarious, outgoing family man.
Ercolino and Johnson had filed harassment complaints against each other and Johnson had reportedly threatened to kill Ercolino before. There were disputes between the two due to Ercolino not promoting Johnson's T-shirt line. One incident that was reported to the police happened inside an elevator, when Johnson threw his elbow at Ercolino, who responded by grabbing Johnson's throat and threatening him. In another incident, in April 2011, Johnson reportedly told Ercolino "I'm going to kill you" while on the elevator. Despite Johnson being laid off in 2011, he visited the company on a regular basis afterwards and reportedly had confrontations with Ercolino each time.
Aftermath.
At a news conference shortly after the shootings, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that it appeared that police might have accidentally shot civilians during the incident. The day following the shooting, Kelly confirmed that all of the bystanders had been wounded as a result of police gunfire.
The New York Police Department released a brief surveillance video of the shootout between Johnson and the police. The footage shows Johnson wearing a suit, holding a briefcase, and raising his handgun at the officers, who then responded with gunfire. Johnson is shown being struck by the police's bullets, dropping his briefcase, and falling to the ground on his back. People sitting on a bench and walking nearby are shown immediately fleeing the scene. A second video was caught by an Australian tourist from street level, where officers are seen with weapons pointed at Johnson lying on his back, just after he was shot. The camera then pans to the nearby streets where bystanders were struck, and to pedestrians trying to hide behind buildings during the ensuing chaos.

Aleksandrs Čekulajevs

Aleksandrs Čekulajevs (born 10 September 1985 in Riga) is a Latvian football player, who currently plays for Maltese First Division side Zejtun Corinthians as a forward.
Čekulajevs is widely famous for his goal scoring abilities. Scoring 46 goals in the 2011 Meistriliiga season he was named the world's top scorer of the year by IFFHS. 
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Riga, Čekulajevs started playing football in 1996. He spent his youth years training with FK Auda, FK Viola, JFK Olimps and FK Auda yet again. In 2006 the youngster was spotted by the Latvian Higher League club FK Rīga and Čekulajevs signed his first professional contract. He played 6 matches there, scoring 1 goal but soon the club hit financial difficulties and Čekulajevs' contract that should have kept him at the club until 2008 was unofficially broken. FK Jūrmala-VV were keen on signing him, but, even though the contract with FK Rīga didn't exist anymore, the club wanted to receive a transfer fee. Furthermore FK Rīga was in debts with its players and hadn't paid Čekulajevs his wage for more than 3 months. FK Rīga went bankrupt in 2008.
FK Auda.
In 2007 Čekulajevs joined his former youth years' club FK Auda on loan from FK Rīga, playing in the Latvian First League. Soon he became a first eleven player and wowed everyone with his scoring abilities, netting 51 goal in 30 league matches. He was not only named the top scorer of the season, but also beat the league's scoring record of all time set by Igors Kirilovs in 2002 with 47 goals in one season. He was also named the best player of the Latvian First League in 2007.
First clubs abroad.
After such a great performance Čekulajevs joined FK Jūrmala-VV in 2008. Playing 21 match there, he scored 3 goals and couldn't settle at the club. Soon he left the team, going abroad for the first time in his career and joining FK Náchod-Deštné in the Czech Fourth Division. During one season there he scored 11 goals in 18 matches and came back to FK Jūrmala-VV in 2009. He started the 2009 Latvian Higher League season with them, but after 6 matches without scoring any goals, left for Víkingur Ólafsvík, playing in the Icelandic 2. deild karla. Čekulajevs scored 10 goals in 17 matches for the club, helping his team win the championship.
JK Narva Trans.
After a successful season in Iceland Čekulajevs was signed by the Estonian Meistriliiga club JK Narva Trans. Soon after joining he found himself as a first eleven player, capable of scoring in almost every match he played. By the end of the season, he had scored 46 goals in 35 appearances, not only being the top scorer of his team and the league, but also setting a new goalscoring record for the division. In June 2012 he was named the third top scorer in Europe by the UEFA league point system, thanks to his 46 goals, coming after Cristiano Ronaldo (46) and Lionel Messi (50). After his great performance, various European clubs showed their interest in signing Čekulajevs. During the winter transfer period he went on trials with the Turkish Süper Lig club Trabzonspor, 2. Fußball-Bundesliga club MSV Duisburg and the Polish Ekstraklasa team Lechia Gdańsk. Although scoring record 46 goals, Estonian football pundits and coaches thought that his achievement would have been much less remarkable if the league had not been represented by the worst team - FC Ajax Lasnamäe, who conceded in total of 192 goals in 36 matches (which was only 6 goals short of worst result in European top tiers). Čekulajevs scored 18 of his goals against bottom-finished Ajax.
Valletta F.C..
Čekulajevs didn't join any of the previously mentioned teams, signing a contract with the Maltese Premier League champions Valletta F.C. on February 8, 2012. He scored a goal on his debut for the club. All in all Čekulajevs scored 4 goals in 6 matches for the club, later being put on the bench for unexplained reasons. In May 2012 Čekulajevs broke his contract with the club, stating that he wasn't happy with the work of his agent.
Lombard-Pápa TFC.
On July 3 2012, Čekulajevs moved to the Hungarian Nemzeti Bajnokság I, as a free agent signing a contract with Lombard-Pápa TFC.
On 1 January 2013, he was released from Lombard-Pápa TFC, having played only four league matches for the club.
TTM Lopburi and Zejtun Corinthians.
On 8 March 2013, it was announced that Čekulajevs had moved to Thai Division 1 side TTM Lopburi on a free transfer, signing a one year contract. On 1 July 2013, after the end of the contract, he moved to the Maltese First Division side Zejtun Corinthians on a free transfer, signing a contract till the end of the season.
International career.
Čekulajevs has represented Latvia U-17 and Latvia U-21, but hasn't been called up to the Latvia national football team yet.

The Yorkshire Mounted Brigade was a formation of the Territorial Force of the British Army, organised in 1908. By 1915 its regiments had been posted away so it was broken up. It never saw active service.
Formation.
Under the terms of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9), the brigade was formed in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It consisted of three yeomanry regiments, a horse artillery battery and ammunition column, a transport and supply column and a field ambulance. The Northumberland Hussars were attached for training in peacetime.
As the name suggests, the units were drawn from Yorkshire.
World War I.
The brigade was embodied on 4 August 1914 and apparently remained in Yorkshire. The regiments left the brigade for other formations in 1915 and it ceased to exist.
By 1915, with its regiments having been posted away, the brigade was dissolved.

<doc id="36816408" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36816408" title="Media of Lebanon">
Media of Lebanon

Lebanon is not only a regional center of media production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world. According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, "the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country". Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is "at the core of a regional media network with global implications".
News agencies.
Lebanon has two state-owned news agencies. Of them the national news agency (NNA), official news body of Lebanon, was launched in 1964. The number of the NNA subscribers was around 600 in 1974. The second agency is central news agency.
Press.
The history of publishing in Lebanon dates back to 1610 when the first printing press was established at the Convent of Saint Anthony of Qozhaya in the Kadisha Valley, making its first publication, "Qozhaya Psalter" -the Bible's book of psalms, which was in both Syriac and Arabic, the first publication in the Middle East. One of the first Arabic-script, printing presses in the region was founded in 1734 at The Convent of St. John in Khinshara where it remained in operation until1899.
In the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut had become not only a multi-religious, commercial center but also an intellectual one, especially after the establishment of two private, higher education institutes, the American University of Beirut in 1864 and the Saint Joseph University in 1875, and it was this period that marked the emergence of Beirut's prolific press. Lebanese publishers and journalists, along with Syrians, also played a major role in establishing the Egyptian press in the nineteenth century.
After independence, Beirut emerged as the epicenter of publishing in the Arab world, characterized by free and liberal media and literary scenes. In the 1940s, Beirut was home to 39 newspapers as well as 137 periodicals and journals that were published in three languages. Beirut also hosted the first book fair in the Arab world in 1956. By the early sixties, there were close to a hundred publishers and more than 250 printing presses in Lebanon. Armenian publications also flourished in Beirut with over 44 publications, including dailies and periodicals. In 1962 the press law came into effect which was introduced by President Fuad Chebab. As of September 2013, the law still regulates printed media in the country.
Authors from Syria, Palestine and elsewhere in the Arab world found refuge in Lebanon's free and liberal publishing industry. Lebanon's press became a huge industry despite the country's small size and has remained a haven for Arabic publishing. The establishment of modern printing presses and sophisticated book distribution channels made Beirut a regional publishing leader, and gave the Lebanese publishers a dominant role in Arab publishing. Lebanon hosts annually two important regional publishing events, the Beirut Book Fair and the Beirut Francophone Book Fair.
Television.
Television in Lebanon was introduced in 1959, with the launch of two privately owned stations, CLT and Télé Orient that merged in 1977 into Télé Liban. Lebanon has ten national television channels, with most being affiliated or supported by certain political parties or alliances. One of the latest addition is Al Mayadeen, which is close to Hezbollah, and it was launched on 11 June 2012 in Lebanon.
Radio.
There are many private radio stations in the country. Two of the leading stations are BBC Arabic and Radio France Internationale. In addition, local stations People’s Voice and Lebanon Voice are also popular radio outlets.
Internet.
Lebanon was one of the first countries in the Arabic-speaking world to introduce internet and Beirut's newspapers were the first in the region to provide readers with web versions of their newspapers. By 1996, three newspapers from Lebanon were online, "Al Anwar", "An Nahar", and "Assafir", and by 2000, more than 200 websites provided news out of Lebanon.

Whistler Geyser is a series of small steaming holes in the Joseph's Coat Springs Thermal Area on the western edge of the Mirror Plateau at the head of Broad Creek in Yellowstone National Park. The Joseph's Coat Springs Thermal Area is an isolated thermal feature not accessed by any marked trail. The Whistler Geyser was discovered by Capt W. A. Jones in 1873 during the Hayden Geological Survey of 1873. In 1884, Arnold Hague and Walter Weed visited the area and documented the thermal features during the Hague Geological Survey. Hague named the vent Whistler because of the noise it made.

Whitby Lighthouse

Whitby Lighthouse is a lighthouse operated by Trinity House. It is located on Ling Hill, on the coast to the south-east of Whitby, beyond Saltwick Bay. It should not be confused with the two lighthouses located in Whitby itself, which protect the town's harbour.
The lighthouse, a white octagonal brick tower designed by James Walker, was built in 1858. Originally, it was one of a pair of towers aligned north-south and known as the High Light; the other, known as the South Light, was high. Their purpose was to show fixed lights over Whitby Rock. In 1890, a more efficient light was installed in the High Light, allowing the South Light to be deactivated. The lighthouse was electrified in 1976 and automated in 1992; the former lighthouse keepers' cottages are now available to hire by holidaymakers. 
The Whitby Fog Signal located adjacent to the lighthouse has been deactivated, and the building is also now used as holiday accommodation.

Chuck Wilson (born February 8, 1954) is an award-winning interviewer, reporter and sports talk radio host. Wilson was an original host when the ESPN Radio Network debuted on January 4, 1992, and has 20-years experience on national radio, including close to 17-years at ESPN.   
In December, 2009, Sports Illustrated.com named Wilson runner-up for “Best National Radio Host” of the decade.
Chuck Wilson has long been a proponent of sportsmanship, ethics and fair play. In 2007, Wilson was named one of the “100 Most Influential Sports Educators in America” by the Institute for International Sport. His EffortandAttitude.org website promotes "the value of giving your best and competing honorably, while bringing a positive, fair-minded approach to everything you do". Wilson states "There are two things in life we alone control...our effort and our attitude". Wilson's work on character education includes an unpaid role with 4eProductions.
4e Productions.
Chuck is Director of Ethics for 4eProductions, a multimedia company that balances entertainment with education and creates and develops original programs, characters, brands and songs designed to address universal social issues, build character and encourage healthy life choices. (currently an unpaid position). 4e’s mission is to “Enlighten, Empower & Enrich Everyone”. The critically acclaimed “Letters to Daddy - The Musical Key to Bully-Free” is a 4e Production.
ESPN Radio (1991–2005, 2010–2013).
In November, 1991, Chuck Wilson was the first host hired for the start-up of the ESPN Radio Network. “Applications for the ESPN jobs flooded the network’s offices —- more than 200 from all over the country. But Wilson was the first to be chosen…and he hadn’t applied. He never even auditioned.” John Walsh, Executive Editor of ESPN told the Providence Journal “We knew Chuck had a terrific program in Rhode Island. We chose him because we liked his knowledge, his news instincts, his writing, the feel of his voice and his literate approach to the program.” 
On January 3, 1992, the Providence Journal wrote “In a field where bombast and success often go hand-in-hand, Chuck Wilson is the exception…He will be one of the anchors when ESPN kicks off its latest far-reaching venture —- a national all-sports weekend radio show….The program will include sports updates every 15 minutes, lots of guests, analysis, follow-ups on breaking stories and live reports from game sites across the country. There will be no call ins. Wilson’s job...will be to keep an even presence to it all…(Wilson) has impressed the region’s fanatical sports-talk audience with his wide-ranging sports knowledge, his fairness, and his keen ability to elicit telling responses from his numerous high-powered guests.” 
ESPN Radio debuted January 4, 1992, on 151 stations with Wilson and Tony Bruno as co-hosts. The 7-hour program aired from 6:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. ET Saturdays and Sundays. The network’s credibility was enhanced with a third co-host from the TV side: Keith Olbermann one day and Mike Tirico the other. By 1996, ESPN Radio affiliates totaled 420 non-duplicative stations and in 2001, as the network approached its 10th anniversary, there were 690-network affiliates, 195 full-time 
Chuck Wilson went full-time at ESPN in 1994 and moved from weekends to weeknights when ESPN Radio's talk programming expanded to seven night's a week. Wilson remained on Gamenight until late July, 2005.
Wilson twice won international awards for his reporting, commentary and analysis including one as co-host of "ESPN Radio Viewpoints" with Frank Deford. Providence Journal TV-Radio critic John Martin wrote "I worked with Chuck (at WEAN) way back when and I can tell you I've never met anyone more dedicated...He is a fanatic for detail who pursues a story about a trade or coaching change with the tenacity of an NFL Linebacker." 
In addition to co-hosting Gamenight, Wilson hosted the acclaimed “ESPN Classic Presents the Legends on ESPN Radio”, in which he conducted in-depth, one-on-one interviews with legendary sports figures. The Los Angeles Times called it “an excellent weekly show.” In 2001, Wilson’s “Legends” interview with Jerry West was the only “Finalist” at the New York Festival International Awards for long-form interview series.
Wilson has been described as the "Voice of Reason" and the "Conscience of ESPN Radio" for his reasoned, even-handed approach in the booth His belief in the value of respect and fair play was reflected in his work. His “Chuck Wilson on Sports” program on Saturday morning’s on ESPN Radio often addressed such issues in youth sports. Wilson also delivered commentaries for the network, many of which centered on the importance of integrity and sportsmanship. In February, 2002, the New York Post wrote “ESPN Radio’s Chuck Wilson last week delivered a poignant essay on how the proliferation of trash-talking places sports in an ever-diminishing state.” 
In late January, 2005, ESPN informed Wilson that he would not be retained when his five-year contract expired. ESPN Radio General Manager Bruce Gilbert complimented Wilson on his work “Chuck is one of the most prepared personalities I’ve ever encountered. His pre-show ritual is regimented, focused and unparalleled in our industry. Chuck has worked with over 200 different co-hosts in his time at ESPN Radio and has shown an amazing ability to comfortably coexist with air talent, athletes, coaches, general managers and assorted characters from all walks of life. Wilson’s last day on ESPN Radio was July 26, 2005. 
On March 14, 2010, Wilson returned to ESPN Radio hosting “SportsCenter Tonight” and other shows and specials for the network. The Providence Journal wrote: “There is a ray of hope — amidst the shouting, the junior high locker room-level jokes, the uninformed opinions, the massive egos, the constant interrupting and talking over one another — for intelligent sports-talk radio. Chuck Wilson is returning to ESPN…Wilson has always been the perfect host for the mature, as opposed to immature, sports fan. There never has been a better on-air interviewer than Wilson. Whether in Providence back in the 1980s or in the 14 years he was with ESPN, he always had interesting guests who enjoyed going on his show because no one worked harder to prepare than he did. Wilson unfailingly asked insightful, probing questions that left his listeners both well-informed and highly entertained.” On March 11, 2013, Richard Deitsch wrote on SI.com: Longtime ESPN Radio host Chuck Wilson, a voice of intelligence amid a sea of chest-beating opinion-offers, is no longer with ESPN Radio. His contract (he worked the last three years on a freelance basis) was not renewed. His last day on ESPN's airwaves was Sunday. Wilson said Scott Masteller, ESPN Radio senior director, told him they were moving in another direction. 'I thank ESPN for bringing me back the last three years in a freelance role.' Wilson said. 'They treated me well'.
XM Radio (2005–2008).
Chuck Wilson joined XM Satellite Radio (now SiriusXM) in September, 2005 in a part-time role for the network’s baseball channel MLB Home Plate (now MLB Network Radio) and became full-time in February, 2006. He hosted “MLB on Deck”, “XM Hot Stove” and “MLB Postseason” and filled in on each of the other shows on the channel Wilson also was the primary fill-in for Charley Steiner on XM’s “Baseball Beat.” In addition, Wilson wrote, co-produced and narrated specials for the channel including “Yankee Stadium Remembered.” Wilson’s job was “eliminated” in November, 2008 after the Sirius/XM Satellite merger.
"100 Most Influential Sports Educators in America".
In 2007, Chuck Wilson was named one of the “100 Most Influential Sports Educators in America” by the Institute for International Sport. Wilson was selected from a list of more than 1,500 nominees. The only other broadcaster named was Bob Costas. In a news release announcing that honored group, Dan Doyle, Executive Director of the Institute for International Sport said “In America and in many other countries, we honor elite athletes, winning coaches, wealthy team owners and media moguls. We praise sports educators yet we really do not honor them in a manner befitting their admirable impact on society. This project is aimed at honoring individuals and organizations who have creatively and effectively used sport in the very best way - as a means to educate and shape positive values” 
"Best National Radio Host of the Decade" honor.
In December, 2009, Sports Illustrated.com named Chuck Wilson runner-up for “Best National Radio Host” of the decade as part of SI.com’s best and worst of the decade in sports broadcasting.  In December, 2010, Wilson, along with ESPN Radio colleagues Doug Brown, Marc Kestecher, Jon Stashower, were named “Best National Radio Voices for 2010” by Sports Illustrated. S.I. media critic Richard Deitsch wrote “Along with the quality of their voices, what stands out here is the diligence and professionalism that each man delivers daily. Names are correctly pronounced, setups are done intelligently. It’s a pleasure to listen to radio professionals who care about quality.” 
Wilson was also named “Comeback Talent of the Year” for 2010 by TalkingTVSports. Steve Sampsell wrote: “Simply put, Wilson is a sports-radio professional. He’s diligent, sounds good and works hard. He cares and he prepares.” In December, 2011, the ESPN Radio anchors were named as “Best National Voices for 2011” by S.I. Media critic Richard Deitsch, who wrote “If I were to single out an individual for this award, I’d likely give it to Chuck Wilson, the ESPN Radio host whose thoughtful work nightly on a variety of topics is first rate and makes that network look very good.” 
Rhode Island Radio Hall of Fame.
In 2011, Chuck Wilson was elected to the Rhode Island Radio Hall of Fame. “Chuck Wilson on Sports” was the first nightly sports talk show in New England to incorporate weekly contributors. The show had a 13-year run from 1981 to 1993, first on WEAN radio, then on WICE and the last 4-years on WPRO. Wilson left WPRO in April 1993 when the station was sold.
Radio-TV career in Providence, Rhode Island.
In July, 1981, WEAN-AM radio in Providence, Rhode Island reached out to Wilson and hired him to report sports in afternoon drive and to start a nightly sports talk show (the market was without one). 'I told WEAN that if they wanted a show with a lot of flash and sizzle, they didn't want me,' said Wilson. 'I told them I wanted to do a guest-oriented program that would treat the callers with respect.' “Chuck Wilson on Sports” broke twenty wire stories in its first three years and was first to correctly report the postponement of the Hearns-Hagler fight. “At the time I went on the air (to break the news that the fight in Detroit would be postponed), the promoter (Bob Arum) was in Detroit saying that the fight was still on. That night, Goody and Pat Petronelli (Hagler’s handlers) called me and said ‘Chuck, please stay in touch with us tonight. You guys know what’s going on more than we do.’ “If you hustle, you get a lot of breaks like that, said Wilson.” The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson has slowly and surely developed a first-class show in Providence. And it’s not just that he routinely has quality guests on, that he’s given local callers a chance to talk with the likes of John Wooden, Al McGuire, Red Barber, Ted Williams, Marvelous Marvin Hagler…or that “Chuck Wilson on Sports” has broken some big stories in this market…or that it’s a program involved in the business of sports reporting, not merely in conversing with callers...It’s that the show has established its niche without having to resort to gimmicks. No laugh tracks. No screaming. No making fun of callers” The Boston Globe wrote: “Wilson was a pioneer in having quality guests from other media: The (Boston) Globe’s Bob Ryan, football guru Mel Kiper Jr., ESPN’s Peter Gammons, and local Providence writers were regulars”. The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson’s logical, even-handed approach and sharp interviewing technique have served him well…Last fall (1984), it claimed more adult male listeners during its time period than any other program in the market.” 
In 1985, WEAN-AM was sold and in 1986, Wilson and morning sportscaster Eric Reid were among the final news staffers let go when the conversion from a news-talk-sports format to an automated, big band-nostalgia format was finished. Wilson’s show was number one on the AM dial from 5-8 pm with male listeners.” Wilson's show returned to the air on WICE Radio on October 27, 1986. In the spring, 1987 Arbitron © ratings, the show posted the station’s highest-rated hours. “Measuring total audience share among listeners 12 years and older, Wilson earned an 8.6 rating in the 6-7 p.m. hour and an 8.4 rating in the 7-8 p.m. hour.” (the next highest-rated hour on the station was a 1.8 share). “In the category of “Men, 18-34”, a key demographic with advertisers, the ratings were more produced still.”. In September 1987, after the ratings were released, “Chuck Wilson on Sports’ expanded to three hours beginning an hour earlier at 5.00 p.m.
In 1988, WICE-AM became the flagship station for the first (and only) season of the New England Steamrollers in the Arena Football League. Chuck Wilson called the play-by-play and former NFL All-Pro safety Tim Fox provided the analysis. Wilson also hosted and co-produced the weekly coach’s show on WNAC-TV with Coach Babe Parilli. Wilson also appeared once a week on as a featured co-host on a “Live” call-in segment on WLNE-TV's Sunday night sports wrap-up show from October, 1988 to December, 1989.
In April, 1989, Wilson left WICE and joined WPRO. That year, Wilson was honored with the UPI Tom Phillips Award for “Best New England Sports Coverage”. The 6-to-9 pm show moved up to the 5-to-8 pm time slot in September, 1991. In January, 1992, the Providence Journal wrote: “WPRO’s strategy to move Wilson back to a 5:00 p.m. start paid off. WPRO topped (its chief competitor) WHJJ in men in every age group in the five o’clock hour. “Chuck Wilson on Sports” continued at WPRO until April 28, 1993. He was one of 36 employees, from among the 55 workers at the AM and FM stations, who opted to leave when the stations were sold. The Boston Globe wrote “Chuck Wilson is New England’s top sports talk show host...Wilson's formula is wonderfully simple for a host with matching skills. He engages guests in Q&A similar to the manner of Bob Costas, and he engages in conversation with generally quality callers. Humor is there as a side dish...In the latest rating book, Wilson’s show was No. 1 in the market, including FM stations, between 5 and 8 p.m. with males 25 to 49. In August, 1994, the Boston Globe wrote:  ”Radio talk-show hosts are decisive in audience levels, proven by the experience of WPRO in Providence. In the year since Chuck Wilson left his nightly three-hour show… Arbitron © numbers show the (WPRO) audience has been halved.” 
Early Radio-TV Career in Rochester, N.Y..
Chuck Wilson’s broadcast career began in January, 1976 at WBBF-AM radio in Rochester, New York. “I had just come out from Ithaca College and was in an interview with the general manager,” said Wilson. “The news anchor came storming in and quit at 3:30. I went on and did the 4 o’clock news.” When the station’s FM sister station changed its format to all-news as WNWZ-FM, Wilson co-anchored afternoon drive for the NBC “News and Information” affiliate. He was later named Sports Director, delivering 16-sports updates, six nights per week. When NBC pulled the plug on its all-news format, Wilson returned to WBBF-AM. In May, 1978, Wilson joined newstalk station WROC-AM (later to become WPXN-AM). In September 1978, Chuck Wilson added TV to his resume, joining WHEC-TV delivering the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday night sportscasts for the market’s top-rated weekend newscast. In July 1980, Wilson left both his radio and TV jobs to join WSAY-AM as Sports Director delivering drive-time commentaries and hosting a nightly sports talk show “Chuck Wilson on Sports”. TV-Radio critic Rudy Martzke wrote “With all the national guests Chuck Wilson has lined up, his sports talk show would do well on a big city station.” 
He lost his job in a budget squeeze 6-months later. Less than 3-month later, he was re-hired. In 1983, the Rochester Times-Union wrote “Chuck Wilson….is probably this town’s all-time best radio sports talk show host.” 
Personal.

Eastern Mounted Brigade

The Eastern Mounted Brigade was a formation of the Territorial Force of the British Army, organised in 1908. After serving dismounted in the Gallipoli Campaign, it was absorbed into the 3rd Dismounted Brigade in Egypt in February 1916.
Formation.
Under the terms of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9), the brigade was formed in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It consisted of three yeomanry regiments, a horse artillery battery and ammunition column, a transport and supply column and a field ambulance. Three other yeomanry regiments (Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire) were attached for training in peacetime. 
As the name suggests, the units were drawn from the East of England, predominantly Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, but also a sub-unit from Cambridgeshire.
World War I.
The brigade, commanded by Henry West Hodgson, was mobilised on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War, concentrated in the Ipswich area of Suffolk and joined the 1st Mounted Division on formation. In late August it moved to Woodbridge.
On 1 December 1914, the Essex Yeomanry was posted to the BEF, joining the 8th Cavalry Brigade. It was replaced by the 2nd King Edward's Horse. 2nd King Edward's Horse left for the Canadian Cavalry Brigade on 1 February 1915 and was replaced in turn by the Welsh Horse Yeomanry.
In September 1915, the brigade was replaced in the 1st Mounted Division by 2/1st South Wales Mounted Brigade.
Gallipoli.
In September 1915 the brigade was dismounted and left Suffolk for Liverpool. On 24 September it boarded RMS Olympic and sailed the next day. It arrived at Mudros on 1 October. The Brigade landed in Gallipoli on 8 and 10 October and was attached to the 54th (East Anglian) Division. On 19 and 20 December it was evacuated to Mudros. In this period, the brigade consisted of the three yeomanry regiments, a signal troop and the field ambulance under the command of Br.-Gen. H. W. Hodgson.
Egypt.
In December 1915, the brigade landed in Egypt. On 22 February 1916, the brigade was absorbed into the 3rd Dismounted Brigade (along with the South Eastern Mounted Brigade). 3rd Dismounted Brigade was later renamed as 230th Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division.
Commanders.
The Eastern Mounted Brigade was commanded by Colonel H.W. Hodgson from 1 April 1912. He was promoted to Brigadier General on 5 August 1914. He remained in command of the brigade until it was merged into the 3rd Dismounted Brigade in February 1916; he took command of this brigade on formation. Later, promoted to Major General, he commanded the Imperial Mounted Division / Australian Mounted Division throughout its existence.

Shaw's first match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling came on August 9, 2010, in a dark match against Jesse Neal which he lost. On the December 30 episode of "TNA Impact!", Shaw accompanied Jeff Jarrett to the ring as part of his entourage in his $100,000 Double J MMA Challenge against Little Red.
In 2012, Shaw was a participant in the monthly Gut Check on IMPACT. Although his chances were nearly ruined after he was attacked by Aces & Eights, Shaw got a second chance the following week and was defeated by Doug Williams in his Gut Check match. The Gut Check judges were impressed and awarded Shaw a contract and a spot on the TNA roster. In actuality, Shaw was signed to a developmental contract. Shaw returned to "Impact Wrestling" on November 22, defeating fellow Gut Check winner Alex Silva.
On January 12, 2013, Shaw appeared at TNA X-Travaganza, wrestling in a seven-man Xscape match, which was won by Christian York, that aired on April 5, 2013. On March 17 2013, Shaw appeared at TNA Hardcore Justice 2 where he was part of a nine-man Hardcore Gauntlet Battle Royal, which was won by Shark Boy, that aired on July 5 2013. Shaw returned on the May 23, 2013 edition of "Impact Wrestling" defeating Alex Silva (by decision since Aces & Eights attacked Silva) to advance into the finals of the Bound for Glory Series tournament to face Jay Bradley at Slammiversary. Shaw lost to Bradley at Slammiversary.
Ohio Valley Wrestling (2012–2013).
Shaw was then assigned to TNA's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), making his televised debut on October 13, 2012. He then began teaming with Alex Silva, forming a regular tag team over the coming weeks. On December 1, Shaw and Silva defeated Jessie Godderz and Rudy Switchblade to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Crimson and Jason Wayne on January 16, 2013. But regained the titles having their second reign on February 27, 2013. However, they lost the titles to The Coalition on April 3, 2013. The following week, Shaw was attacked backstage by the Coalition. Shaw would return to OVW TV on May 4 after revealing that he had been under the mask of the Coalition's Gillyman for several weeks and was put in a one-on-one match against Jason Wayne at the May 11 Saturday Night Special. He would have his in-ring return the following week one-on-one against Jessie Godderz. Shaw would continue his war with the Coalition in a victory over Jason Wayne at the May 11 Saturday Night Special and a victory over Crimson on the May 18 episode of OVW TV.
Samuel Shaw; Face Turn (2013–present).
On November 21 during "Impact Wrestling: Turning Point", Shaw appeared in an at home interview with Christy Hemme. During the interview, he asked to be called Samuel Shaw and also portrayed a character similar to Patrick Bateman of the film and book "American Psycho", as well as a ring attire similar to the clothes worn by Dexter Morgan. On the January 2, 2014 episode of "Impact Wrestling", Shaw made his debut by defeating Norv Fernum via submission, during which he made continuous glares at Hemme who was at ringside. Shaw later became an obsessed fan of Hemme, and started asking her on dates, including one in his house where it was shown how Shaw had a room full of posters and pictures of Hemme. On the February 6 episode of "Impact Wrestling", Hemme confronted Shaw about the mannequin and the room full of posters. On the February 20th "Impact Wrestling", Shaw attacked Mr. Anderson in a rage after watching Hemme and Anderson converse for several minutes. Shaw then carried Hemme away after she was accidentally caught up in the ruckus and injured. February 27th "Impact Wrestling", Shaw would confront Hemme in an attempt to explain himself. After failing and being interrupted by Mr. Anderson, Shaw would solidify himself as a heel after using Hemme as a shield to fend off Mr. Anderson who was attempting to exact revenge for the previous week. Shaw would use his "kata gatame" finishing move to choke out Mr. Anderson.
On the March 6th edition of "Impact Wrestling," Samuel Shaw faced off against Eric Young with Mr. Anderson replacing Hemme as the ring announcer for the match. Anderson's presence at ringside ultimatetly cost Shaw the match as he would be disqualified due to Anderson's distraction. After the match, Shaw would choke out Anderson like last week then claim he was "going to claim what was rightfully his," heading for the backstage area where Hemme had been watching via a ring monitor. At Lockdown on March 9th 2014, Shaw defeated Mr. Anderson after escaping the cage following the use of Christy Hemme as a distraction by pulling Hemme through the camara cut-out of the steel cage, Anderson successfully rescued Hemme but was caught in Shaw's kata gatame. The previously unconscious referee only saw Samuel Shaw escape the cage thus declaring him the winner. Shaw lost a rematch against Anderson on the following "Impact Wrestling" bringing a mannequin dressed as Christy Hemme to the ring. On April 3 episode of "Impact Wrestling", Shaw defeated Mr. Anderson in a Straitjacket match after rendering him unconscious following two kata gatame attempts. At "TNA Sacrifice", Anderson defeated Shaw in a Committed match, whereby he put Shaw into a van heading for a psychiatric facility for intervention.
The next time Shaw appeared on TV was on 22nd May episode of iMPACT Wrestling at the psychiatric facility. A man walked in said that Shaw had a visitor which was later revealed to be Gunner. Gunner said he was going to help him with his obsession with Hemme and with his insanity. Over the weeks following, segments were shown in which Gunner tried to help Shaw in various ways by explaining to Shaw why he understood what Shaw was going through and participating in various activities like going through Shaw's drawings & playing Go Fish with Shaw, which eventually led to Shaw being released under Gunner's supervision on 26th June episode of iMPACT. On July 3, he return as a face and Samuel Shaw apologize to Christy Hemme about their relationships and Mr. Anderson gave Samuel Shaw another chance to be friends after he follows Gunner's supervision.

Get Schooled

The Get Schooled Foundation (also Get Schooled or getschooled.com) is a non-profit organization dedicated to using the power of media, technology and popular culture to motivate and inspire young people, their families and teachers to improve high school graduation rates and college-going rates. Get Schooled combines powerful national content and programming (on-air, on-line and on the ground), with school-based engagement strategies to ensure both a broad reach and a measurable impact.
About.
Get Schooled focuses on two areas that have the most direct impact on students’ long-term educational success: attendance and college affordability. Get Schooled works with schools, school districts and cities around the country to improve attendance rates among middle and high school students. It also focuses on efforts aimed at increasing the number of young people who have the tools and information they need to access financial aid for college.
School Attendance.
Get Schooled is one of the few national education organizations focusing on school attendance as a driver of student success. In May 2012, it released a study on the scope and consequence of chronic absenteeism in partnership with Johns Hopkins University. The report found only a handful of states measure and report on chronic absenteeism, which the report defines as missing at least 10 percent of school days in a given year, or about 18 days. It estimates that 10 to 15 percent of students nationwide are chronically absent and that adds up to 5 million to 7.5 million students who miss enough school to be at severe risk of dropping out or failing to graduate from high school.
The data problem is structural and runs from the school to the state to the federal level. At the school level, chronic absenteeism is largely masked by daily attendance rates. A school can report a 90 percent average daily attendance rate and have 40 percent of students chronically absent, because on different days different students make up the 90 percent. Schools know that students are missing but don’t look at the data by student to show individual absenteeism rates.
Key findings include: 
The magnitude of the problem is likely understated as Balfanz and his researchers could find chronic absenteeism reported for only six states: Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Nebraska, Oregon and Rhode Island. Several states, including California and New York, do not even collect the individual data needed to calculate chronic absenteeism.
The impact of these missed days is dramatic – students are less likely to score well on achievement tests and less likely to graduate. Students who miss 10 percent of school days on average score in the 30th percentile on standardized reading and math tests, compared to those with zero absences, scoring in the 50th percentile.
Looking at data from multiple states and school districts, the researchers found that consistently high chronic absenteeism was the strongest predictor of dropping out of high school, stronger even than course failures, suspension or test scores. Data from Georgia showed a very strong relationship between attendance in grades 8-10 and graduation. There was as much as a 50 percentage-point difference in graduation rates for students who missed five or fewer days compared to those who missed 15 or more days.
These findings have been extrapolated into a user-friendly attendance calculator that allows users to see a personalized view of the impact of missed days on the likelihood of graduating and on math and reading achievement tests.
Programs.
School-Based Challenges: Get Schooled partners directly with schools on a series of friendly competitions aimed at increasing student engagement and behavior whether around school attendance or the completion of financial aid forms. Close to 200 schools have participated in a challenge and schools have seen attendance gains of as much as 8.56 percent. Winning schools include Chaparral High School (Las Vegas), East High School (Des Moines), Thurgood Marshall High School (Washington), Aki Kurose Middle School Academy (Seattle) and Lincoln High School (Warren, Michigan). And most recently in 2013 Bethel Regional High School won the Future Forward Challenge
Get Schooled College Affordability Challenge: Get Schooled and MTV launched the College Affordability Challenge in the Fall of 2010. Recognizing the difficulty in finding the information student’s need to access financial aid, MTV called on its audience for creative, technology-based ideas aimed at making it easier to navigate the financial aid maze. The contest was one of MTV’s most popular, with hundreds of submission from across the country. The winner, Devin Valencia’s idea for a Facebook app, was announced at Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI University) in San Diego in April. The app was launched for widespread use in November 2011.
Wake Up and Get Schooled: The Get Schooled Foundation and numerous celebrities partnered to creatively motivate teens across the country to improve their attendance by getting up and getting to school on time. More than 85,000 high school students receive morning Wake Up calls that feature recorded motivational messages from their favorite celebrity. The program started in September 2011 and is an ongoing program. Many celebrities whom students admire and respect including One Direction, Ciara, Greyson Chance, Nicki Minaj, Jesse McCartney have pre-recorded calls. The pilot program with The Mayor of New York City's Office Anti-Truancy Taskforce yielded positive results - chronic absenteeism was down by 24% over last year at several New York City elementary schools and at the eight participating middle schools, truancy was reduced by 16%.
Get Schooled Celebrity Ambassadors: The ambassador integrates celebrities that resonate with tweens and teens to help enforce the message about the importance of education. Celebrities who have supported the cause include Victoria Justice, Tyra Banks, Nicki Minaj, Trey Songz, Christian Slater, George Lopez, Jennifer Hudson and more.

<doc id="36816695" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36816695" title="Panel van (Australia)">
Panel van (Australia)

In Australia, panel vans were a development of the Australian "ute" (a variety of pickup based on a car chassis). By the late 1980s, they began to slowly disappear from Australian roads as demand fell and major manufacturers slowly ceased building them.
Most utes usually had an option of metal, then later rigid plastic, shells that would fit over the back of the tray of the ute, thereby extending the vertical space drivers could store in the tray, usually to just above the existing roofline of the passenger cab. Later shells offered plastic windows for ventilation along the sides and even pop-out or swing-out windows at the rear to aid the driver's rear vision. These were eventually integrated into the body of the ute itself to form a hybrid vehicle that, while based on a ute body, offered more rear space than a conventional station wagon with its rear seats folded down. These became known to the Australian public essentially as "panel vans".
Initial models were fitted at the rear with swing-down and -up doors (like utes), but later models came equipped with "barn-door" configurations that opened out to the sides of the vehicle, rather than down, aiding the loading of bulky freight into the vehicle without (as badly) damaging the body. Passengers could climb from the interior passenger cab into the cargo bay behind them easily. Later the installation of safety cages which segregated passengers from the cargo area became popular to prevent freight from the back sliding into the passenger cab (and potentially injuring the driver).
The first panel vans were manufactured by Holden and Ford in the late 1950s, but did not become popular until the mid-1960s. By the early 1970s, usually when based on the Holden/Belmont or Holden Kingswood and Ford Falcon model of the time, panel vans had become Australian cultural icons. The Holden Sandman is probably the best-remembered of these: for example, one of the vehicles driven by Mel Gibson in the 1979 movie "Mad Max" was thought to be either a Holden Sandman or a customised Holden panel van (apparently a 1975 HJ model in both cases). Ford panel vans (known briefly as Sundowners) were also popular, to a lesser degree. Chrysler also came to the party in 1976, offering a CL model Valiant panel van dubbed the Chrysler Drifter, but these could not compete with the popularity of Ford and particularly Holden, and were axed in 1978.
Younger drivers were especially attracted to panel vans, for reasons such as the ease with which a mattress could be installed within the cargo bay. Consequently, panel vans also attracted nicknames such as "sin bins," "shaggin' wagons," "mobile virgin conversion units", "screw canoes," "Scooby-Doo mobiles" after the "Mystery Machine" of the Hanna-Barbera animated cartoons, and "fuck trucks." This kind of activity was frequently carried out at the local Drive-in theater During the 1970s it also became fashionable to decorate the exterior sides with murals painted with intricate detail. As well as the Kombi VW, these were very popular with surfers (or wanna-be's), as it was convenient to carry boards etc. in the back.
Australian police forces also purchased fleets of panel vans to use in a black maria, or paddywagon, role. These were known formally as "Divisional Vans" and in slang as "Divvy Vans".
Painters, electricians, and general labourers also found panel vans ideal for their trades, as the cargo bay offering extended capacity otherwise wasted in passenger space, and a highly customisable interior, without the bulk or extended dimensions of other longer-base vans.
The final production of Holden's Sandman in the HZ series, featured a choice of V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0 litre V8 engine and a limited slip differential. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, they would get a bonus velvet mattress with Holden logo embroidered. The price would be more than 150% of the cost of the basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture - order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured in October 1979.
The popularity of panel vans waned in the 1980s. Holden's last release was their WB model. Subsequently, Ford became the sole manufacturer of them until 1997, when the XH model was released. This was to prove the last entry in the history of the Australian panelvan. In 2003, Holden released a new Sandman, based on their Holden VU Ute of the time. This Sandman was a show car and were never released, and while they were identified (and marketed) as panel vans, they still retained the rear window and firewall of the ute they were originally based on, preventing movement between the cargo bay and the passenger cab, as offered by traditional panel vans.

Vanguard Cave

Vanguard Cave is a natural sea cave in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar which is part of the Gorham's Cave complex. This complex of four caves has been nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The cave complex is one of the last known habitations of the Neanderthals, with a period of inhabitation from 55,000 to 28,000 years ago. It is located on the southeast face of the Rock of Gibraltar.
Physical description.
Vanguard Cave is one of four caves which together make up the Gorham's Cave complex which has been nominated to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the others being Bennett's, Gorham's, and Hyaena Cave. Vanguard is a high cave which contains of deposits. These deposits have been blown into the cave over time and are mixed in with archaeological evidence. These can be excavated and analysed to reveal how the geography and life has changed during the time that they were deposited. Vanguard was first excavated in 1989, and lies just a few metres north of Gorham's Cave, which was excavated in 1951.
Neanderthals and Vanguard Cave.
In 2008 it was revealed that the cave supplied evidence that Neanderthal man had a more varied diet than previously thought. The Neanderthal's diet is now thought to have included fish and molluscs and marine animals like monk seal and dolphin. This may seem obvious given that Vanguard cave now looks out onto the Alboran Sea; however, scientists think that the cave was around from the shore at the time of the Neanderthals. Lower sea levels may have also assisted ancient man by revealing islands between Gibraltar and the North African coast. This may have made the now wide Strait of Gibraltar easier to cross and there are similar Mousterian sites in Morocco at Grottes des Pigeons and Jebel Irhoud. 
The evidence does not just consist of a few bones. Researchers have been able to establish that the people there selected, collected and transported mussels to the cave. The cave contains a hearth, and the Neanderthals left evidence of burning which could be used to open the shells. The shellfish also included limpets and these are widely found at other Neanderthal sites, however experts remain divided as to whether these were a significant part of the diet or just a useful snack. Clive Finlayson has argued that the diet was very varied and that evidence found within the caves indicates that six types of vegetation were within easy reach of the caves. The Neanderthals lived there for a short time but evidence shows that they were knapping stones as they ate the molluscs. Carcasses of seals were brought to the cave and comparison with Neanderthal sites at Capellades in Catalonia indicate that after being hunted they were butchered in the cave. The stains on monk seal, ibex, and red deer bones support this theory. The list of animals eaten in Vanguard include bream, dolphins, sea urchins, and bluefin tuna.
Excavations in the middle part of the cave revealed a hearth that was used through at least three successive periods by Neanderthals, with another ash layer containing a hearth, marine shells and stone tools in the upper part of the cave marking a shorter period of occupation.
Archaeology today.
Vanguard Cave is a site of continuing archaeological interest. There was a long investigation in August 2012 which involved an international team brought to Gibraltar. The team spent three weeks excavating at Gorham's cave and three weeks at Vanguard.

<doc id="36816715" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36816715" title="Area gas boards">
Area gas boards

The area gas boards were created after the passing of the Gas Act 1948 by Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government.
History.
In the early 1900s the gas market in the United Kingdom was mainly run by county councils and small private firms. At this time the use of an inflammable gas (often known as "town gas") piped to houses as a fuel was still being marketed to consumers, by such means as the National Gas Congress and Exhibition in 1913. The gas used in the 19th and early 20th centuries was coal gas but in the period 1967–77 British domestic coal gas supplies were replaced by natural gas.
In 1948 Clement Attlee's Labour government reshaped the gas industry, bringing in the Gas Act 1948. The act nationalised the UK gas industry and 1,064 privately owned and municipal gas companies were merged into twelve area gas boards each a separate body with its own management structure. Each area board was divided into geographical groups or divisions which were often further divided into smaller districts. These boards simply became known as the "Gas Board", a term people still use when referring to British Gas, the company that replaced the boards when the Gas Act 1972 was passed.

Teles Pires Dam

The Teles Pires Dam is a hydroelectric dam under construction on the Teles Pires River, upstream of the confluence with the Tapajós river, on the border of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Pará. The 80 meter dam will impound a 150 square km reservoir (55 km original river bed and 95 km inundated area), 84% in Mato Grosso state (Paranaita district) and 16% in Para state (Jacareacanga district).
The dam is part of a planned six power plant "Hidrovia Tapajos/Teles Pires" project to create a navigable waterway connecting the interior of Brazil to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The waterway will consist of five dams on the Teles Pires river (53MW Magessi Dam, 430MW Sinop Dam, 342MW Colider Dam, 1820MW Teles Pires Dam, 746MW Sao Manoel Dam) and the 230MW Foz do Apiacas Dam on the Apiacas river.
The Teles Pires Dam is currently under construction, while the smaller upstream dams are still in the planning stages.
Design.
The Teles Pires Dam is a gravity dam constructed of composite materials layered on a Roller-compacted concrete core, located on the Teles Pires river, 330 km upstream of the confluence with the Tapajos river, on the border between the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Para 
Impacts.
Brazilian law requires water impoundments to undergo a very thorough approval process to ensure that each project meets environmental, social, political, and safety criteria.
Social.
The most frequent objection is that the dam builders failed to adequately consult with indigenous peoples, as required by law. The Brazilian government indigenous protection foundation FUNAI predicts that there may be un-contacted indigenous populations in the region that will be affected by the dam. On March 30, 2012, a judge suspended construction of the Teles Pires Dam to preserve a waterfall that is considered sacred by an indigenous tribe 
Environmental.
The Teles Pires Dam does not impound a large reservoir because it is a run-of-the-river project. The dam also feature significant environmental re-mediation efforts. As a consequence, there has not been strong environmental opposition to the implementation of the Teles Pires Dam.

Broadly speaking, the dam impounds the Cooper River and creates Lake Moultrie. Specifically Lake Moultrie is fed directly from Lake Marion by a diversion canal built concurrently with the dam. This artificial rerouting of the Cooper River basin has effectively unified the Santee and Cooper River systems into a single hydrological drainage entity.
The overall New Deal-era Santee Cooper Power and Navigation Project improved navigation, provided hydroelectric power, and improved the general health, recreation, and economy of the area. The project was the largest land-clearing project in U.S. history up to that point, with over 12,500 workers clearing over of swamp and forestland. of dams and dikes were constructed, including a , tall earthen dike. The Pinopolis Dam included the hydroelectric station and navigation lock, the highest single-lift lock in the world. A spillway was built to control floodwaters, with 62 gates allowing overflow of excess water.

The $48.2 million project (55 percent federal loan, 45 percent federal grant) first generated electricity on Feb. 17, 1942. As transmission lines were built, power flowed to customers in Berkeley, Georgetown and Horry counties, and ultimately to electric cooperatives serving customers in 46 counties.
The project also flooded the Santee Canal, the cemeteries and plantations of St John's Parish Berkeley, and other historic resources.

Arzhang Davoodi

Arzhang Davoodi (born c. 1952) is an Iranian democracy activist, teacher, and author. In 2002, he and Amir Abbas Fakhravar co-founded the Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS), an organization that aims to institute democracy in Iran.
Davoodi was arrested in October 2003 after criticizing human rights conditions in Iran in the documentary "Forbidden Iran", particularly the death in custody of Canadian-Iranian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi. He was tried in 2005 by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for "spreading propaganda against the system" and "establishing and directing an organization opposed to the government". The court found him guilty and sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment and 75 lashes; as of August 2012, the latter part of his sentence had not been implemented. Amnesty International protested the sentence, designating Davoodi a prisoner of conscience.
Davoodi served portions of his sentence in several different prisons, including Evin Prison. In 2005, he joined fellow prisoners Hojjat Zamani, Bina Darab-Zand, Valiollah-Feyz Mahdavi, Mehrdad Lohrasbi, Farzad Hamidi, and Jaafar Iqdami in a hunger strike to protest their confinement with violent offenders in Rajaii Shahr. Human Rights Watch called the six "political prisoners", "being held for no reason other than their expression of peaceful political views", and urged that they be released.
In August 2012, a new charge of "enmity against God", which carries a possible death sentence, was brought against Davoodi. Amnesty International stated that the charge appeared to be linked to the release by CIS of a recording in which Davoodi called for "freedom and democracy".

Confederation of Iranian Students

The Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS) , is a pro-western, Iranian student organization with more than 10,000 members inside Iran and abroad. Its principal objective is to empower the will and confidence of the Iranian people in their quest for freedom. It reaches out to students through social, cultural, artistic, literary, and sports activities. CIS works to promote freedom, human rights and democracy in Iran. The Confederation educates the public, organizes, and mobilizes grass-root support in the United States, Europe, and Iran to promote freedom of expression, press, and religion – the constitutional foundations of a new free, secular and democratic Iran.
Overview.
The Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS) was founded by Amir Abbas Fakhravar, Arzhang Davoodi, "Potkin Azarmehr", "Peyman Aref", "Iman Samizadeh" and "Helia Honarmand" and "Roza Radbeh" after the July 9, 1999 student uprising in Iran. The name of this organization was Independent student movement first and in July 2005 it was changed to Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS) . CIS claims to have over 10000 members, with student Federations in Iran, the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Austria, and Turkey. It is the largest International Iranian student movement active both inside and outside of Iran. According to various Iranian opposition groups, CIS may be a front for the Iranian government which aims at identifying regime opponents.
CIS and Amnesty International.
Amnesty International released several statements since 2002 to support many CIS members who were arrested and tortured in Iran in jail, like Amnesty's report to support Amir Abbas Fakhravar on April 2004, Amnesty's report to support CIS co-founder Arzhang Davoodi on August 24, 2012, Amnesty's Report to support CIS executive Director, Nahid Kalhori, Amnesty's report to support CIS board member, "Shiva Kamalipour-Azad" and "Mohammad-Reza (Arash) Fakhravar" on May 6, 2011.
CIS role in Iran's Oil sanctions.
CIS have been working successfully with the U.S. Congress and Senate to design and support the adoption of strong oil and gas, and financial sanctions against the Iranian regime to cut the revenue flows essential for the regime to survive. International sanctions are now bankrupting the regime and the Iranian people are holding the regime responsible for their food and fuel shortages and increasing poverty. CIS has been especially effective in mobilizing European Union support for strong sanctions and raising the awareness of European publics of the plight of the Iranian people who seek a free, democratic and secular government to replace the illegitimate and corrupt regime now in power. U.S. CRS in its report which is published on State Departments website notified CIS role in Iranian OIl Sanction; "CIS supports imposition of severe sanctions against Iran, including total oil sale embargo to deprive the regime of the funds it needs to pay its security forces." 
CIS and Democratic Transition in Iran.
CIS hosted Iran Democratic Transition Conference I (IDTC 1) at The George Washington University and United States Congress on January 22–24, 2011 and June 19, 2011. This conference was sponsored and coordinated by the Institute of World Politics and Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS). Iran Democratic Transition Conference takes a pragmatic approach to exploring the prospects of political change in Iran and to paving the way for the establishment of a secular, pluralistic, democratic government in Iran. A host of expert Iranian panelists, Iran scholars, and U.S. law makers will discuss policy, strategic, and social issues to establish a shared vision of liberty. Key Topics at this conference were: Transition to Democracy: Challenges and Opportunities; New Media: Cyber Revolution and Individualism; New Generation: Demands, Abilities and Political Vision; Secularism: Ideology and Alternatives; Sanctions: "Behavior Change" or "Regime Change"?; Oppositions Leadership: In Exile or from Within?; New Constitution: "Reform" or "Regime Change"; Iran and the World: Mutual Commitments; Remembering Neda, The Face of the Iranian Green Movement, on her Birthday.
IDTC Speakers: U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), U.S. Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), U.S. Congressman Ted Deutch (D-FL), U.S. Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA), Mohammad Reza Heydari and "Abolfazl Islami" (Former Islamic Republic of Iran's Diplomats from Norway, Finland and Japan), Amir Abbas Fakhravar (Research Fellow at Institute of World Politics, award winning writer and jailed dissident), Dr. Kenneth Katzman (Senior specialist, Iran and Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Congressional Research Service), Dr. John Lenczowski (President of IWP), Kambiz Hosseini (TV host, VOA-Parazit), Dr. Walid Phares (Special advisor and Co-Chair of Middle East and North Africa for U.S. Presidential candidate Gov.

The "Iran Democratic Transition Conference II" with the title of "Remembering Neda, the symbol of Freedom and Democracy in Iran" took place on the anniversary of the day her life was brutally taken as she was peacefully participating in a people's march in Tehran, giving rise to what has since become known as The Iranian Green Movement. Since then, the Movement has inspired other young people in undemocratic nations in the region, who are rising up to the call for freedom. This conference will examine the dynamics of the Green Movement, the role of secularism versus religion in the political life of Iran; the question of religious freedom in an Islamic society; the role of the media; and the implications of the Green Movement for U.S. policy. (IDTC 2) followed the highly successful conference (IDTC 1) held at the George Washington University and the U.S. Capitol in January, 2011. Participants included Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Congressman Ted Deutch (D-FL), and Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), as well as representatives from the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI). The conference engaged students, non-governmental organizations, academics, and others, both inside and outside Iran, for the purpose of contributing to a better global understanding of the needs and desires of the Iranian people as they seek greater liberty of expression and political engagement. The present conference carries on the momentum and the spirit of that event by reaching out to the civil society of Iran.
CIS in United States Congressional Reports.
The United States Congressional Research Service report dated September 5, 2012, stated the following regarding CIS: “Opposition/”Green Path Hope.” All of the blocs and personalities below can be considered part of the Green Path of Hope opposition/revolutionary movement. However, overall leadership of the opposition is unclear, with several components competing for preeminence and the ability to determine the direction of the protest movement. Student Opposition Leaders/Confederation of Iranian Students/Office of Consolidation of Unity (Daftar Tahkim-e- Vahdat). Staunch oppositionists and revolutionaries, many now favor replacement of the regime with secular democracy. Generally young and well-educated, want free and open media and contact with the West. Many are women. One key bloc in this group is the Confederation of Iranian Students (CIS), led by Amir Abbas Fakhravar, who was jailed for five years for participating in July 1999 student riots. CIS, committed to non-violent resistance, is an offshoot/competitor of the Office of Consolidation Unity, which led the 1999 riots. At the time of those riots, most students were strong Khatemi supporters, but turned against him for acquiescing to hardliner demands that he crack down on the rioting. The crackdown killed four students. Student leaders currently attempting, with mixed success, to gain support of older generation, labor, clerics, village-dwellers, and other segments. CIS supports imposition of severe sanctions against Iran, including a total oil sale embargo, to deprive the regime of the funds it needs to pay its security forces. CIS and other student activists purportedly developing list of Iranian officials who they assert have committed major human rights abuses—an intended parallel to the “deck of cards” of alleged Saddam-regime “war criminals” developed by the United States before the overthrow of Saddam."

Israel Worsley

Israel Worsley (1768−1836) was an English Unitarian minister.
Born at Hertford in 1768, Israel Worsley entered at Daventry Academy in 1786, under Thomas Belsham who made him a Unitarian.
In December 1790 a committee of merchants at Dunkirk (where there was no English service) engaged Worsley as their minister, the services to be conducted with a ‘Book of Common Prayer compiled for the use of the English Church at Dunkirk . . . with a Collection of Psalms,’' Dunkirk, 1791, 12mo. The volume was reprinted in "Fragmenta Liturgica" (1848, vol. vi.) by Peter Hall, who seemed unaware that it was itself a reprint of the ‘reformed’ prayer book of Theophilus Lindsey. How long this experiment lasted is not certain. Worsley established a school at Dunkirk.
After the outbreak of the war between Britain and France in 1793 he made his way to England, but returned after the peace of Amiens (1802), only to be arrested on the resumption of hostilities (1803), ultimately making his escape with difficulty through the Netherlands. From 1806 to 1813 he ministered at Lincoln, and from 1813 to February 1831 at Plymouth, where he established a fellowship fund and a chapel library. He left Plymouth with his family for Paris, intending a six months' stay, but was persuaded to open (in June) a place for Unitarian worship (in the Rue de Provence). In January 1832 he formed a French Unitarian association for circulation of tracts. The cholera of March 1832 dispersed his congregation, but he kept his chapel open till June 1833. Returning to England, he again ministered at Lincoln (1833−6).
Bibliography.
Besides sermons, tracts, and school-books, he published:
Family.
He was the grandson of John Worsley (d. 16 Dec. 1767), was for fifty years a successful schoolmaster at Hertford. Israel's father, John Worsley, who died at High Wycombe. Buckinghamshire, in 1807 (Monthly Repository, 1808, p. 515), had continued the school at Hertford for thirty years, with less success, being too easy a disciplinarian; he published a Latin grammar (1771, 8vo).
Israel Worsley died at Le Havre on 3 Sept. 1836. His son, William Worsley (1796−1881), was B.A. Glasgow 1816, studied at Manchester College 1816−19, and was Unitarian minister at Thome (1819−22), Hull (1822−25), and Gainsborough (1825−1875).

Tell Ain el Meten

Tell Ain el Meten is a tell in the area of El Meten in the Rashaya District, south-eastern portion of the Bekaa Governorate of the Republic of Lebanon. It is located opposite the village of Sawiri.
A Heavy Neolithic archaeological site of the Qaraoun culture was discovered by Peter Wescombe and J. King in 1966 along a track north of the Ain el Meten spring and about west of the road. The tell is cone shaped and composed of rubble stones and grey soil. Imported brown worked flint tools were found along with others made from Nummulitic, Eocene flint in the fields on the lower slopes. Another type of brittle and drab-coloured flint found in the area was unsuitable for toolmaking. The material was determined to be of Heavy Neolithic or possibly earlier Paleolithic origins.
Pottery was also found suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age and Middle Bronze Age. This was evidenced by sherds with flat bases, grey or cream burnishing. The grey burnished sherds were equated to the Syrian bottle type. Various other sherds were found with finger impressed rims, to which could not be assigned a definite date. A handle from the Cypriot II stage was also found along with traces of occupation in the Late Iron Age and Islamic periods.
The site was largely intact in 1966 with terracing for fruit trees in the area and a rocky crest of the tell, which had been ploughed.

Sara Plummer Lemmon

Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon (September 3, 1836 – 1923) was an American botanist. A number of plants are named for her, as is Mount Lemmon in Arizona for being the first white woman to ascend it. She was responsible for the designation of the golden poppy as the state flower of California in 1903.
Early years.
She was born in New Gloucester, Maine on September 3, 1836. She was educated in Massachusetts at the Female College of Worcester. Plummer then moved to New York City, teaching art there for some years, and studying at Cooper Union. She also served as a nurse for a year or two during the Civil War.
Move to California.
Falling ill in 1868–69, she moved to California in 1869 for her health. Newspapers of the day described Plummer as "one of the first 'intellectuals'" to move to Santa Barbara, Indeed, in 1871 she established a lending library that became an important cultural center for Santa Barbara. Shortly after arriving in Santa Barbara, she established the "Lending Library and Stationery Depot", with the aid of a friend, Unitarian minister Henry Bellows, who helped her acquire her first few hundred volumes. Operating out of a jewelry store on State Street, Plummer charged $5 membership or 10 cents for borrowing books, and sold a variety of art and music supplies, and held cultural gatherings including lectures and art exhibits.
While walking about Santa Barbara, she acquired an interest in botany, and turned her paintings towards botanical illustrations. In 1876 Plummer met John Gill (J.G.) Lemmon (1831–1908) when he was giving a lecture in Santa Barbara. Lemmon, a Civil War veteran and former Andersonville prisoner, was, like Plummer, a self-trained botanist. In 1880 they married, Plummer assuming his name. At that point, she sold her library to the Odd Fellows to operate, and she and John Lemmon began traveling and cataloging botanical materials.
Lemmon and her husband John honeymooned in the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, Arizona. With the aid of E. O. Stratton, they eventually scaled the tallest peak, which they named Mount Lemmon in her honor – one of the few mountains named for a woman. While on their trip, the Lemmons discovered and cataloged a number of species unique to the mountain.
After returning from their trip, they continued their botanical endeavors. The Lemmons co-developed the Lemmon Herbarium at their home at No. 5985 Telegraph Avenue, later donating it to UC Berkeley, where it was later merged into and called the University and Jepson Herbaria. Lemmon continued her botanical illustrations, including as the official artist for the California State Board of Forestry (from 1888–1892) and acquired a national reputation for her work. During the 1890s she also advocated for the adoption of the golden poppy as the state flower of California, eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed in 1903.
Death.
Her husband J.G. died in 1908, and Sara Plummer Lemmon died in California in 1923. The couple is buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, in Plot 46, with a poppy on her gravestone.

Lamplight

"Lamplight" is a song by the Bee Gees, released as the B-side of "First of May", but in Germany, this song was chosen as the A-side. and this song was released on their double album "Odessa" in March 1969. The song was written and composed by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb. The song had lead vocals by Robin Gibb, but the Bee Gees' manager Robert Stigwood chose "First of May" for the A-side, No other singles were released from the album, and this was the incident that is thought to have caused Robin to quit the group. In Germany, "Lamplight" was chosen as the A-side of "First of May", but the other versions of both tracks released in Germany, chosen "First of May" as the A-side.
Recording.
The song's demo was recorded in October 25, 1968, and the same version was released on "Sketches for Odessa"; the second version was also released on "Sketches". The song starts with a French lyric "Alors viens encore cherie J'attendrai ans après ans sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue". The line "I close my eyes" was appeared on the lyrics, quoting the Bee Gees' song of the same name from 1967 on the album "Bee Gees' 1st". The demo was also a similar flow to the final version. There are no French words featured at the beginning; it starts straight in the first stanza.
The single version of the song was released in mono, but the album version was in stereo. The song features French lyrics at the beginning (these were featured on the second and third version of that song, but not on its first version) The musicians who played on the track were Robin Gibb on piano and mellotron, Maurice Gibb on bass, piano, guitar and mellotron, Barry Gibb on guitar, Colin Petersen on drums and an orchestra conducted by Bill Shepherd.

William Worsley (priest)

William Worsley (1435?−1499), was a dean of St. Paul's cathedral.
He is assumed to have been educated at Cambridge, as he is not mentioned in Wood; he is described as ‘sanctæ theologiæ’ ‘professor,’ but in his epitaph states ‘doctor of laws.’ On 29 April 1449 he was advanced to the prebend of Tachbrook in Lichfield Cathedral, on 30 March 1453 to Norwell Overall in Southwell, and in 1457 to South Cave in York Cathedral. These preferments were apparently conferred on him during his minority by his uncles, for it was not till 20 Sept. 1460 that he was ordained priest. On 19 May 1467 he was moved to the rectory of Eakring, Nottinghamshire. On 28 Sept. 1476 he became archdeacon of Nottingham, and on 22 Jan. 1478−9 he was elected dean of St. Paul's in succession to Thomas Winterbourne; he retained with it the archdeaconry of Nottingham and the prebend of Willesden in St. Paul's, and from 1493 to 1496 was also archdeaconry of Taunton.
Worsley held the deanery throughout the reigns of Edward V and Richard III, but in 1494 he became involved with the revolutionary movement by Perkin Warbeck. He was arrested in November, confessed before a commission of Oyer and terminer, and was found guilty of high treason on the 14th (Rot. Parl. vi. 489b). The lay conspirators were put to death, but Worsley was saved by his order, and on 6 June 1495 he was pardoned (Gairdner, "Letters and Papers", ii. 375). In October following parliament passed an act (11 Henry VII, c. 52) restoring him in blood (Statutes of the Realm, ii. 619). He had retained his ecclesiastical preferments, and died in possession of them on 14 Aug. 1499, being buried in St. Paul's Cathedral; his epitaph and a very pessimistic copy of Latin verses are printed by Weever (Funerall Monuments, p. 368; Gough, Sepulchral Mon. ii. 337). Fabyan describes Worsley as ‘a famous doctour and precher’ (Chronicle, p. 685). His will, dated 12 Feb. 1498−9, was proved at Lambeth on 8 Nov. 1499, and at York on 27 March 1500, and is printed in ‘Testamenta Eboracensia,’ iv. 155−6; by it he left money for an obit in St. Paul's.
Personal.
Born probably about 1435, is believed to have been the son of Sir Robert Worsley of Booths in Eccles, Lancashire, and his wife Maude, daughter of Sir John Gerard of Bryn, Lancashire. His brother Robert married Margaret, niece of William Booth and Lawrence Booth, both of them Archbishops of York, to whose influence William owed most of his preferments.

2012 Indian Premier League opening ceremony

The opening ceremony of the fifth season of Indian Premier League (IPL) took place on the evening of 3 April 2012 in the YMCA College of Physical Education, Chennai. The ceremony was designed by Wizcraft Entertainment, and began at 19:30 IST, lasting almost two and half hours. The tickets for the ceremony were priced at and were available online at the official website of the IPL from 16 March 2012. Similar to the previous versions, the captains of the nine participating teams took the "MCC Spirit of Cricket" pledge. Various Bollywood actors, dancers, and musicians performed in the ceremony.
Background.
The event was planned to be held at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, but was shifted to the YMCA College of Physical Education ground. The capacity of the YMCA college was lesser than that of the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, and this caused disappointment. Tamil Nadu Cricket Association said that the decision was made because the opening match was to be played at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, and thus they cannot have opening ceremony in it due to risk of the cricket ground getting damaged by the performances. Sabbas Joseph, director of Wizcraft Entertainment, talking about the ceremony stated that,"There will be good things, lots of entertainment and cricket. It's the first time that such a large-scale, separate concert is being organised for the IPL, so big things have been planned."
Ceremony.
The ceremony started at 19:30 IST, however the gates were opened at 17:00 IST. A huge cut out poster of Salman Khan was kept at the YMCA ground prior to the ceremony. The ceremony was hosted by Amitabh Bachchan who had undergone two abdominal surgeries in February 2012. Earlier he had conveyed a message via Twitter saying, "April 3rd is the day for the opening. Preparing for it already. Getting back into the grind." Media reports suggested that Bachchan will be dancing, however Joseph said that this is unlikely to happen. He began the ceremony by reciting a poem, "If I were to be born again" by Prasoon Joshi. Later, the Colonial Cousins, along with South African band First Project and DJ Ravi Drums, performed in the ceremony. It was followed by Priyanka Chopra performing with cricketers like Harbhajan Singh on various songs from her films. Prabhu Deva also performed on songs from his films such as "Wanted" and "Hum Se Hai Muqablah".
After that, few members of the Chennai Super Kings' squad arrived on the stage, and Chopra joined them. Later Kareena Kapoor danced to songs from her films "Ra.One" and "Agent Vinod". The performances of Chopra and Kapoor were choreographed by Shiamak Davar and his companions. After the dance performances, the captains of the nine teams took the "MCC Spirit of Cricket" pledge. Captain of the defending champions, M.S. Dhoni placed the trophy on the podium and it was followed by the chairman of IPL, Rajiv Shukla crediting the players, franchise owners, supporting staff and the spectators for the success of IPL. He then formally opened the 2012 IPL, saying, "It gives me a great pleasure to flag off the fifth edition of the DLF Indian Premier League, an arena where quality international and domestic cricketers take part in intense contest of strategy and skill. IPL is a platform where talent meets opportunity."
Salman Khan performed on songs from his films "Ready", "Bodyguard", "Wanted", "Partner" and "Jab Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kiya". American pop star Katy Perry closed the ceremony performing "Firework" and "California Gurls". The ceremony ended with fireworks.

Internetware

Internetware is a term coined to describe the emerging software paradigm for the Internet computing environment. It also refers to the software exhibiting the desired properties (described below) to meet the requirements of the Internet environment.
The Internet is a dynamic, open, ever-changing environment. These characteristics impose new requirements on software over Internet. More specifically, in traditional software, the requirements of the tasks are often pre-determined and clearly stated, and the tasks are performed by pre-designed software components following fixed algorithms. On the other hand, in the Internet computing environment, more and more requirements are unclear or undetermined, and the software components that collaborates to finish a task are dynamically obtained. As an example mentioned by Mei et al., handling swine flu epidemic requires emergent cooperation among organizational and individual software and services, such as airlines, hotels, hospitals and mobile phones. We do not know what components will be involved in the collaboration nor their behaviors. We also do not know what kind of collaboration needs to occur or will occur beforehand.
History.
Internetware was first proposed by Chinese researchers from Peking University and Nanjing University in 2003. Through the support from two Chinese National Basic Research Programs (also known as 973 programs) from 2002–2008 and 2009–2013, approximately 80 researchers from different Chinese universities, institutes and companies have participated in the research of Internetware, and a large number of papers have been published.
The development of Internetware soon attracted international attentions, and many researchers outside China started to work on this topic. IBM participated in the 973 program as one of the main industrial cooperators. The annual Asia-Pacific Symposium on Internetware started in 2009 in cooperation with ACM SIGSOFT, attracted authors from US, Australia, Canada, and attendees from Japan and Korea. Articles discussing Internetware also appear in various venues by international authors.
Internetware Research.
The research community of Internetware propose methodologies and techniques to develop software exhibiting the above properties. As of the year 2012, the research of Internetware mainly covers the following three aspects.
Software model.
The software model defines the basic form of Internetware. The current research tries to define the basic interfaces of the software entities, such that collaboration is enabled. Mathematical models of collaboration are also proposed based on the interfaces.
Operating platform.
The software operating platform implements the software model, supporting the features defined in the entity model and the collaboration model. For example, researchers have proposed connectors that enable communications between heterogeneous protocols, and runtime software architecture to govern on-demand collaboration.
Engineering approach.
The engineering approach guides the developers for building Internetware. Researchers have proposed to use software architecture as a high-level blue-print to guide the Internetware development, where the individual components can be dynamically discovered and replaced at runtime.

Chernokozovo detention center

Chernokozovo detention center ("the Chernokozovo SIZO") is a notorious prison in the village of Chernokozovo, Chechnya, where it served as the main part of the "filtration camp" system during the Second Chechen War.
History.
The Soviet-era maximum-security penitentiary facility at Chernokozovo was closed down during the First Chechen War in December 1994. It was re-opened by the Russian federal forces during the Second Chechen War at the end of 1999, officially as a "temporary reception center for the persons detained on the grounds of vagrancy and begging". In fact, it served as an unofficial prison camp for captured separatist fighters, as well as one of at least four main "filtration camps" (or "filtration points") for male and female civilians (including children) who were either arbitrarily detained as "suspicious persons" at hundreds of checkpoints or just non-selectively rounded-up in their own homes during the mass and indiscriminate "mopping-up" ("zachistka") operations and then kept there without any charges. According to official figures, about 10,000 people passed through the "reception center" at Chernokozovo. Among the prisoners was also the RFE/RL journalist Andrei Babitsky, kidnapped by Russian federal forces in Chechnya, who in a statement for the United States House of Representatives said: "Everything that we read about concentration camps of the Stalin period, all that we know about the German camps, all this is present there."
In February 2000, the prison gained worldwide notoriety for prisoner abuse when the reports emerged of prisoners being routinely subjected to human gauntlet beatings, various forms of torture, rape and other abuse, and their families to extortion at the hands of guards (a widespread practice of releasing prisoners, or even handing over their corpses, in exchange for ransom). A number of prisoners died from abuse or have "disappeared" without trace. Afterwards, Russian government engaged in what Amnesty International called a cover-up, before opening the prison for visits by foreign journalists and international observers. Prior to the high-profile visit by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the prison was turned from a "reception center" into a SIZO (investigative isolator) and freshly painted, a new prison staff from the Ministry of Justice were sent to replace the previous guards (who were reportedly contract soldiers), and conditions there improved notably, while torture victims have been relocated to other "filtration points". In October 2000, Human Rights Watch released its 99-page investigative report about Chernokozovo, titled ""Welcome to Hell"".
Since 2005, Chernokozovo detention center's status is of a "penal colony" for convicts, run by Interior Ministry forces of the local government led by Ramzan Kadyrov, who is personally taking part in its management. Living conditions there reportedly have improved vastly since 2000, however still remained bad (for example, healthy persons are kept together with tuberculosis patients) and reports of continued beatings, torture and other abuse have persisted.
ECHR rulings.
In 2007, in the first ruling on a torture case from Chechnya, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found Russia guilty of torturing Chitayev brothers, Adam and Arbi, at Chernokozovo during their detention between April and October 2000, finding "that their suffering was particularly serious and cruel". Among various other forms of abuse, the brothers were subjected to electric shocks, suffocated with a cellophane bag and a gas mask, and had parts of their skin torn away with pliers.
in 2003, Zura Bitiyeva, a female former Chernokozovo detainee who had filed a case with the Court relating to her torture, was summarily executed together with her family during a raid by a group of unidentified Russian special forces troops. In a 2008 ruling, the Court ruled that Bitiyeva's illegal detention in Chernokozovo and the inhuman and degrading treatment she suffered during detention had been in "total disregard of the requirement of lawfulness", and blamed the Russian state for her and her family's subsequent murder.

Farkas Kovacsóczy

Farkas Kovacsóczy de Körtvélyfa (c. 1540 – 11 September 1594) was a Hungarian noble in the Principality of Transylvania, who served as Chancellor of Transylvania from Summer 1578 to 28 August 1594. His son, István later became Chancellor too.
Family.
Kovacsóczy was born into a Transylvanian noble family of Slavonic origin. His parents were János Kovacsóczy, who fled from Slavonia due to the Ottoman invasion, and Erzsébet Török de Buda. He had two siblings.
He married Kata Farkas de Harina first in 1581, three sons (including István) and two daughters were born. He married for the second time to Krisztina Kendi de Szarvaskend, they had no children. His father-in-law was Sándor Kendi, a member of the Transylvanian Royal Council and father of István Kendi, who was elected Chancellor in 1608.
Career.
Between 1572 and 1573, he studied in France and at the University of Padua. He finished his studies there along with Stephen Báthory, who later became Prince of Transylvania and King of Poland. Kovacsóczy was a prominent counselor of him since 1571.
He accompanied the prince to Poland in 1576, where he served as secretary for the Transylvanian affairs at the Royal Chancellery in Kraków. He returned to home in 1578 and was appointed Chancellor besides voivode Christopher Báthory, who took the state affairs on behalf of his brother. Christopher died in 1581 and succeeded by his son, Sigismund Báthory in the office of voivode. Stephen Báthory established a three-member Regent Council besides the underage Sigismund. Between 1583 and 1585, Kovacsóczy served in that council, along with his future father-in-law Sándor Kendi and László Sombori.
Kovacsóczy participated in the royal election of 1587 in Poland as envoy of the Prince of Transylvania. In 1594, he strongly opposed the turning against Ottomans and the alliance with the Habsburg Empire, along with Balthasar Báthory, cousin of prince Sigismund, and Sándor Kendi. He considered Sigismund's step as dangerous. As a result, the oppositional magnates was arrested by the prince. Farkas Kovacsóczy was strangled to death in the prison of Szamosújvár (today: "Gherla, Romania") on 11 September 1594.

933d Tactical Airlift Group

The 933d Tactical Airlift Group is an inactive United States Air Force Reserve unit. It was last active with the 440th Tactical Airlift Wing, based at Billy Mitchell Field, Wisconsin. It was inactivated on 1 September 1975
History.
Following the mobilizations in 1961 and 1962 for the Berlin Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Continental Air Command (ConAC) realized that it was unwieldy to mobilize an entire wing unless absolutely necessary. Their original Table of Organization for each Wing was a wing headquarters, a troop carrier group, an Air Base Group, a maintenance and supply group, and a medical group. In 1957, the troop carrier group and maintenance and supply groups were inactivated, with their squadrons reassigned directly to the wing headquarters - despite the fact that many wings had squadrons spread out over several bases due to the Detached Squadron Concept dispersing Reserve units over centers of population. 
To resolve this, in late 1962 and early 1963, ConAC reorganized the structure of its reserve Troop Carrier Wings by establishing fully deployable Troop Carrier Groups and inserting them into the chain of command between the Wing and its squadrons at every base that held a ConAC troop carrier squadron. At each base, the group was composed of a material squadron, a troop carrier squadron, a tactical hospital or dispensary, and a combat support squadron. Each troop carrier wing consisted of 3 or 4 of these groups. By doing so, ConAC could facilitate the mobilization of either aircraft and aircrews alone, aircraft and minimum support personnel (one troop carrier group), or the entire troop carrier wing. This also gave ConAC the flexibility to expand each Wing by attaching additional squadrons, if necessary from other Reserve wings to the deployable groups for deployments. 
As a result, the 933d Troop Carrier Group was established with a mission to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations.
The group was one of two C-119 groups assigned to the 440th TCW in 1963, the other being the 934th Troop Carrier Group, at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, Minnesota.
Was upgraded to newer C-130A Hercules transports in 1971, retiring the Flying Boxcars. Group was inactivated in 1975 as part of post-Vietnam War drawdown.

Michael Stryphnos

Michael Stryphnos (, ) was a high-ranking Byzantine official under the Angeloi emperors. 
Stryphnos is first attested in 1192 as "sebastos" and the head of the "vestiarion" (the imperial treasury), under Emperor Isaac II Angelos (reigned 1185–1195). Stryphnos then married a sister of Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, the wife of Emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) and through this connection advanced to the position of "megas doux", commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy, when the latter ascended the throne. The contemporary historian Niketas Choniates portrays him as a man of "extraordinary rapacity and rare dishonesty" (Guilland), who used his position to sell off the sails, anchors and other equipment of the fleet, down to the very nails of the ships. His actions marked the effective end of the Byzantine fleet, which was hence unable to resist the Fourth Crusade a few years later.
As "megas doux", he was also the governor of the joint province of Hellas and Peloponnese (southern mainland Greece), and in this capacity he went to Athens ca. 1201–1202 to oppose the rising power of Leo Sgouros, a local magnate turned autonomous ruler. He does not seem to have succeeded in checking Sgouros, but the local bishop, Michael Choniates, nevertheless composed an encomium in his honour. Three seals of Stryphnos survive, as well as a large enamelled gold ring, possibly given to him on his appointment as "megas doux".

Mozambique (song)

"Mozambique" is a song written by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy that was originally released on Dylan's 1976 album "Desire". It was also released as a single and reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100.
At the time of the song's release, the titular country of Mozambique had just emerged from a ten-year insurgency war against Portugal which led to Mozambique's independence. As a result, some left wing supporters wanted to see the song as lending support to the newly independent country. However, the lyrics of the song don't support such an interpretation, being slight and treating the country as merely a place for a romantic getaway in the sun, apart from a fleeting reference to "people living free". This angered some of Dylan's fans. Music critic Paul Williams suggests that "Mozambique" may have had its genesis in Dylan's desire to write a song about Marseilles.
The melody received more praise than the lyrics. Robert Shelton describes the tune as "playful." Authors Oliver Trager and John Nogowski both describe the melody as "great" and particularly praise the violin playing of Scarlet Rivera.
Author Oliver Trager describes "Mozambique" as "a light love song with lighter political overtones." Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls it "effervescent" and "Dylan at his breeziest." Paul Williams considers "Mozambique" to be one of several songs on "Desire" with "wonderful, inventive, pleasure-giving" music which nonetheless fails to reach the intensity and unity of the other songs because the lyrics are "a little too vague, too clever" and "too distanced." Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin considers the song to be a "ditty dredged up from the bottom of the barrel," "ghastly" and "the weakest song on "Desire"."
"Mozambique" was also released as a single as a follow up to the Top 40 hit "Hurricane" and it reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100. Heylin suggests that Dylan may have released it as a single over songs fans might have preferred—particularly "Sara"—to spite fans who criticized the song for its slight lyrics trivializing the conflict in Mozambique. The song also appeared on the compilation album "Masterpieces". A live performance was included in the television special "Hard Rain" but not on the associated album.

Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe

Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe full German name: "Wilhelm Eugen Georg Friedrich August Albrecht zu Schaumburg-Lippe" (8 August 1899, in Hannover, Germany – 7 November 1929, in Caterham, Surrey) was a son of Prince Maximilian August Jaroslav Adalbert Hermann of Schaumburg-Lippe (1871–1904) and Princess Olga Alexandra Marie of Württemberg (1876–1932). Prince Eugen was second pilot on a Luft Hansa (forerunner to the legally separate Lufthansa) air liner flying from Croydon to Amsterdam
Family.
His father, Prince Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe, son of Prince William of Schaumburg-Lippe and Princess Bathildis of Anhalt-Dessau, married Princess Olga of Württemberg on 3 November 1898 at Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg. Prince Eugen was born 8 August 1899. He had two brothers: Prince Albrecht of Schaumburg-Lippe and Prince Bernhard of Schaumburg-Lippe. Prince Albrecht married on 2 September 1930 Baroness Walburga von Hirschberg. They had no children. He had a daughter with Baroness Marie-Gabriele von Pfetten-Arnbach. Prince Bernhard died in childhood.
Life.
On 6 November 1929 he was flying in a Luft Hansa Junkers G 31 which was carrying four crew and four passengers. The plane crashed in Foster Down near Caterham probably due to dense fog and low clouds and the pilot misjudging the height of trees. Three of the crew and three of the passengers were burnt to death at the scene.
Prince Eugen von Schaumburg-Lippe also escaped from the wreckage, but he was seriously injured. Kidston raised the alarm and reported the accident to Croydon Airport. He was treated at Caterham Cottage Hospital. The fire was eventually extinguished by firemen from Caterham. Personnel from RAF Kenley assisted the local police in collecting the remains of the deceased and transporting them to a mortuary in Caterham. Von Schaumburg-Lippe died the day after the accident from injuries sustained in the crash.
This was the prince's first air accident, "although he had risked his life scores of times." He is a stunt flyer "by inclination," and only two-weeks ago he "performed hair-raising stunts" over Berlin's Tempelhof Air Field, where he swung from a trapeze hanging from a flying airplane. He was working on his qualifications for the Berlin-Croydon-Amsterdam service for a full pilot's license.
Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe died unmarried at age 30 at Caterham.

Federal Government of Somalia

The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) (, ) is the internationally recognised government of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
Overview.
The Federal Government of Somalia was established on August 20, 2012, following the end of the interim mandate of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).
It officially comprises the executive branch of government, with the parliament serving as the legislative branch. It is headed by the President of Somalia, to whom the Cabinet reports through the Prime Minister.
Structure.
Constitution.
The national constitution lays out the basic way in which the government is to operate. It was passed on June 23, 2012, after several days of deliberation between Somali federal and regional politicians. To come into effect, the constitution must be ratified by the new parliament.
Under the new constitution, Somalia, now officially known as the "Federal Republic of Somalia", is a federation.
Executive branch.
The President is elected by the Parliament. He or she serves as the head of state and chooses the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of government and leads the Council of Ministers. According to Article 97 of the constitution, most executive powers of the Somali government are vested in the Council of Ministers. The incumbent President of Somalia is Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed is the national Prime Minister.
Council of Ministers.
The Cabinet is formally known as the Council of Ministers. It is appointed by the Prime Minister.
Parliament.
The Federal Parliament of Somalia elects the President and Prime Minister, and has the authority to pass and veto laws. It is bicameral, and consists of a 275 seat lower house as well as an upper house capped at 54 representatives. By law, at least 30% of all MPs must be women. Members of parliament were selected by a Technical Selection Committee, which was tasked with vetting potential legislators that were in turn nominated by a National Constituent Assembly consisting of elders. The current Speaker of the Federal Parliament is Mohamed Osman Jawari.
Judiciary.
The national court structure is organized into three tiers: the Constitutional Court, Federal Government level courts and Federal Member State level courts. A nine-member Judicial Service Commission appoints any Federal tier member of the judiciary. It also selects and presents potential Constitutional Court judges to the House of the People of the Federal Parliament for approval. If endorsed, the President appoints the candidate as a judge of the Constitutional Court. The five-member Constitutional Court adjudicates issues pertaining to the constitution, in addition to various Federal and sub-national matters.
Federal Member States.
Local state governments, officially recognized as "Federal Member States", have a degree of autonomy over regional affairs and maintain their own police and security forces. However, they are constitutionally subject to the authority of the Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia. The national parliament is tasked with selecting the ultimate number and boundaries of the Federal Member States within the Federal Republic of Somalia.
Education.
The Ministry of Education is officially responsible for education in Somalia. As of January 2014, the institution is led by Ahmed Mohamed Gurase.
Healthcare.
The Ministry of Health heads the country's healthcare system. As of January 2014, the institution is led by Ahmed Mohamed Mohamud.
Media.
The federal government has two main media outlets: Radio Mogadishu, the state-run radio station; and Somali National Television, the national television channel.
Military and police.
The central government's Ministry of Defence is officially responsible for the Somali Armed Forces and its various subdivisions. As of January 2014, the Ministry is led by Mohamed Sheikh Hassan.
Capital.
The constitution recognizes Mogadishu as the capital of Somalia. The Parliament of Somalia meets in the city, which is also the seat of the nation's Supreme Court. In addition, Mogadishu is the location of the presidential palace, Villa Somalia, where the President resides. The Prime Minister also lives in the city.
International relations.
The Federal Government of Somalia is internationally recognized as Somalia's official central government. It occupies the country's seat in the United Nations, the African Union, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The Somali federal government has a Permanent Representative and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations. It also has embassies in various countries.
Additionally, there are various foreign diplomatic missions in Somalia. Ethiopia maintains an embassy in Mogadishu, and consulates in Hargeisa in Somaliland and in Garowe in Puntland. Djibouti re-opened its embassy in Mogadishu in December 2010. The following year, India also re-opened its embassy in the capital after a twenty-year absence, as did Turkey. Iran and the United Kingdom followed suit in 2013. Italy maintains a special diplomatic delegation and a Technical Mission to Mogadishu, and is scheduled to re-open its embassy in the city. In 2013, Egypt likewise announced plans to re-open its embassy in Mogadishu.
In January 2013, the United States announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years.
Passports.
For travel, Somali citizens can obtain a Somali passport from government-designated locations or from Somali embassies abroad.

Federal Parliament of Somalia

The Federal Parliament of Somalia (; often "Baarlamaanka Federaalka Soomaaliya"; ) is the national parliament of Somalia. Formed in August 2012, it is based in the capital Mogadishu and is bicameral, consisting of an Upper House and a Lower House (House of the People).
Establishment.
Post-transition Roadmap.
As part of the official "Roadmap for the End of Transition", a political process devised by former Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali which provides clear benchmarks leading toward the establishment of permanent democratic institutions in Somalia by late August 2012, members of Somalia's then ruling Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and other administrative officials met in the northeastern town of Garowe in February 2012 to discuss post-transition arrangements. After extensive deliberations attended by regional actors and international observers, the conference ended in a signed agreement between TFG President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Prime Minister Ali, Speaker of Parliament Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamed Farole, Galmudug President Mohamed Ahmed Alim and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a representative Khalif Abdulkadir Noor stipulating that: a new 225 member bicameral parliament would be formed, consisting of an upper house seating 54 Senators as well as a lower house; 30% of the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) is earmarked for women; the President is to be appointed via a constitutional election; and the Prime Minister is selected by the president, who would then name a council of ministers.
On 23 June, TFG and regional leaders approved a draft constitution after several days of deliberation. The National Constituent Assembly, which consists of 30 elders drawn from each of the country's four major Somali clans (Darod, Dir, Hawiye, Rahanweyn) and 15 from a coalition of minority groups based on the 4.5 power-sharing formula, overwhelmingly passed the new constitution on 1 August. 96% of the 645 delegates present voted for it, 2% against it and 2% abstained. To come into effect, it must be ratified by the new parliament.
Technical Selection Committee.
On 18 August 2012, a list of 202 new parliamentarians was released, with a total of 215 legislators eventually sworn in on 20 August. A further 15 nominated lawmakers were approved by the Technical Selection Committee (TSC), an independent body officially tasked with vetting the applicants. However, verification of their paperwork was still pending before they could be officially sworn into parliament.
The remaining candidates that were submitted by the National Constituent Assembly's elders to the TSC were rejected for failing to meet specific criteria agreed upon by stakeholders that partook in earlier agreements, including the Galkayo and Garowe Principles accords. The minimal selection criteria required potential MPs to be Somali nationals possessing a "sound mind", to have at least a high school diploma, to be capable of carrying out parliamentary duties, and to have no reported links with warlords, rebels, armed groups and other potential spoiler elements. The TSC also based its screening procedure on detailed background information on the parliamentary candidates that was forwarded to it by the United Nations and African Union.
Inauguration.
The inaugural session of parliament was held on 20 August 2012, at the Mogadishu airport since the main parliament building was undergoing renovations. The outgoing President, Prime Minister and Speaker of Parliament all attended the ceremony in the capital, which witnessed the swearing in of most of the MPs and the selection of a new interim Speaker.
Speaker of Parliament.
On 20 August 2012, former Somali National Army (SNA) General Muse Hassan Sheikh Sayid Abdulle was appointed Interim Speaker and Acting President. Voting for a new Speaker of Parliament was held on 28 August 2012, with former Minister of Transportation and Minister of Labor and Sports Mohamed Osman Jawari elected the permanent Speaker. Jaylaani Nur Ikar and Mahad Abdalle Awad are serving as his First Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker, respectively.
Duties.
The Federal Parliament of Somalia constitutes the legislative branch of government, with the Federal Government of Somalia representing the executive division.
The parliament elects the President, Speaker of Parliament and Deputy Speakers. It also has the authority to pass and veto laws.
In addition, the national parliament is tasked with selecting the ultimate number and boundaries of the autonomous regional states (officially, "Federal Member States") within the Federal Republic of Somalia.
On 2 April 2014, the parliamentary committee of interior and security announced that it would soon establish a committee to oversee the federalism process in Somalia's constituent provinces.
Composition.
The Federal Parliament of Somalia is bicameral, consisting of an Upper House and a Lower House (House of the People). It includes many professionals, university graduates and women. At least 30% of seats are legally reserved for women, a quota secured by Somali parliamentary consultant Hodan Ahmed and women political leaders. Ahmed had also helped form the Somali Women Parliamentary Association in 2009 in the preceding Transitional Federal Parliament.
An official list of Members of the Federal Parliament was first published on 17 August 2012 by the Office of the Somali Parliament.
Upper house.
Formation of the upper house is pending, and is capped at 54 representatives.
House of the People.
The House of the People, or Lower House, is eventually expected to comprise 275 MPs.
Voting system.
Article 47 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that "the regulations concerning[...] elections at the Federal Government level[...] shall be defined in special laws enacted by the House of the People of the Federal Parliament of Somalia."
Tenure.
According to the Office of the Somali Parliament, sitting legislators are mandated to serve from 2012 to 2016.
Memberships.
The Federal Parliament of Somalia is a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the international organization of parliaments.

Soviet Weekly

The Soviet Weekly was a propagandistic newspaper, published from 1942 until 1991, that gave news of the Soviet Union in English. Its stated aim was "to assist in the development of British-Soviet friendship by providing an objective picture of Soviet life and opinion."
Published by Sovinformburo, the Press Department of the Soviet Union, at the Soviet Embassy in Britain, its first edition (as the "Soviet War News Weekly") appeared in 1942 (the year after the German invasion led to the USSR becoming an ally of the UK). The final issue was that of 5 December 1991, three weeks before the Soviet Union was dissolved.
Issued on Thursdays and offering "an upto-the-minute and authentic picture of the USSR", it had a modest cover price (6d, or two and a half pence, in 1967), but most issues were distributed free. In 1946, the weekly print-run was 75,000. 
One of its early editors was the screenwriter, novelist and (later) pagan, Stewart Farrar (1916-2000). Mary Rosser-Hicks (1937-2010), the future chief executive of the Communist daily the Morning Star, worked for the paper until 1975, as did South African anti-apartheid activist Shanthie Naidoo during the early 1970s.
In popular culture.
The comedian and writer Alexei Sayle has described how this was the newspaper his Communist parents read during his upbringing in Liverpool in the 1950s and 1960s.

Sukhoi Superjet 130

The Sukhoi Superjet 130 () also known as Superjet NG is a planned modern, fly-by-wire narrow-body medium-range jet airliner to be developed by Sukhoi and United Aircraft Corporation. The design is based on the Sukhoi Superjet 100, with a seating capacity expected to be in the 130 - 145 seat category. It is designed to compete internationally with the Bombardier CSeries, the Airbus A319, and smaller models of Boeing 737NG. A smaller version, seating 115 passengers, will be developed, by Sukhoi, as SuperJet Stretch.
Development.
In 2011 Russia’s ministry of industry and trade published its views for the development of an advanced commercial plane in its MPT Report in 2011. This was the beginning of the SSJ 130NG.
The SSJ 130NG will have an aluminum fuselage and use composite materials for its wings which includes the center section, elevator and rudder. Sukhoi believes that the new materials will weigh 15 to 20 percent less than it does on other commercial planes, increase the plane's service life by 20 to 30 percent, reduce the plane's operating costs by 10 to 12 percent, and reduce energy consumption during the plane's manufacturing by 10 to 15 percent. Fuselage plugs will give the SSJ 130NG a greater length. The Superjet NG will derive Irkut MS-21’s composite wing and engines of the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G family (instead of Aviadvigatel PD-14). Some SSJ 100 suppliers might be ousted from the SSJ 130NG.
Its development has been re-confirmed in August 2012. The financing of the Superjet NG project will be started in 2016. The first serial Superjet NG should be put into operation in 2020.

Marino Moretti

Marino Moretti (July 18, 1885 – July 6, 1979) was an Italian poet and author.
He was born in the port town of Cesenatico, Italy, where his mother instilled in him a love of literature. After a failed attempt at an acting career, he began writing poetry; his first work being published in 1903. During his career he wrote twenty novels, eight books of verses, three book-length memoirs, and many short stories. Among his better known works are "The Voice of God" (1920) and "Widow of Fioravanti" (1971). His home in Italy has since been turned into a museum.

SS Üsküdar

SS "Üsküdar" was a small passenger ferry built in Germany for the Turkish company Şirket-i Hayriye and launched in 1927. She sank in lodos weather on March 1, 1958 in the Gulf of Izmit. The accident killed 272 people on board including seven crew, 39 survived the incident.
Ship.
SS "Üsküdar" was built by F. Schichau Shipyard in Elbing, Germany in 1927 with funnel number 72. She was the first of two identical vessels the Turkish urban transportation company Şirket-i Hayriye commissioned in the Republican era.
She was long with a beam of and a draft of . Three steam engines of propelled her initially at , which later dropped to .
SS "Üsküdar" was capable of carrying 344 passengers. 430 lifejackets, 35 lifebuoys and two lifeboats were on board the ferry.
Sinking.
SS "Üsküdar" was on scheduled shuttle trips on the Sea of Marmara between İzmit and Değirmendere, a town on the southern coast of the Gulf of İzmit.
On March 1, 1958, "lodos", a heavy SW storm was raising high seas. Mehmet Aşçı, captain of SS "Üsküdar", departed the ferry three minutes before the scheduled time of 12:30 local time from İzmit Pier, because the vessel was more vulnerable at the pier than at open sea. Shipmate Ali Kaya, who jumped onto the pier and untied the hawser, could not return to the ferry as the ship suddenly left the pier. The ferry had nine crew and 302 passengers aboard including 76 students from a local vocational high school.
As the ferry headed to Değirmendere, high waves raised by the storm blowing at rocked the small vessel. The bridge broke off and fell into water, taking the captain and the boatswain with it. The rudder chain broke leaving the ferry uncontrollable. Water filled the engine room and the front passenger department after breaking the window glass.
26 minutes from her departure, SS "Üsküdar" careened over on the port side and sank at 12:53 local time. 272 people died including 38 students and seven crew. 37 passengers and two crew survived the disaster.
Wreck's salvage.
Eight days after the incident, the Turkish Navy started a search and rescue operation. The muddy seabed hindered salvage efforts. On March 19, 1958, after eleven days of endeavors, the wreck was lifted with three slings off the deep seabed. Four corpses were recovered. It was observed that at some places, the steel sheets of the ship's hull were torn.

Strobilos

Strobilos (), modern Aspat or Çıfıt Kalesı, is a Byzantine-era fortress on the south-western Anatolian coast, across from the island of Kos and near modern Bodrum in Turkey.
It is first mentioned in 724, making it one of the few known Anatolian localities to be established during the early Middle Ages and hence, according to researcher Clive Foss, "should reveal the appearance of a distinctively Byzantine site". It is best known as a place of exile, as well as an important fortress and naval base of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, which was twice attacked by the Arabs, in 924 and 1035. The existence of a monastery on the site is also attested in the 11th century. The fortress was sacked by the Seljuk Turks around 1080, but it was recovered and refortified under the Komnenian emperors. It remained in Byzantine hands until 1269, when it was captured by the Turkish emirate of Menteshe.

<doc id="36817504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36817504" title="Solomon Lazard">
Solomon Lazard

Solomon Lazard, also known as S. Lazard, (1827–1916) was an entrepreneur in 19th Century Los Angeles, California, a member of the city council there in 1854 and in 1861–62 and, some say, the founder of the international banking firm Lazard Frères and Company.
Personal life.
Lazard was born in Lorraine, France on April 5, 1827. He married Carrie or Carolyn Newmark, the daughter of Joseph Newmark, on July 5, 1865. They had three boys and three girls, including sons E.M. Lazard and Sylvan A. Lazard and daughters who married Louis Levin and A. Jacoby.
In Los Angeles, as a mark of respect he was known as Don Solomon, "and being popular, he frequently acted as floor manager at balls and fandangos."
Lazard arrived in the United States in 1844 or 1850 and became a U.S. citizen about 1853, but In 1861 he visited France and was arrested on the charge that he still owed military duty to that country, where he had been born. He served six days in prison and then hired a substitute to take his place.
Lazard died on January 13, 1916, leaving his wife, two sons and a daughter. A funeral service was held in the family home at 657 Westlake Avenue in the Echo Park district, with interment following at Home of Peace Cemetery (East Los Angeles).
Career.
Dry goods.
Lazard sailed from Europe to New York City in 1844, and then to San Francisco in 1851. He remained there about a year until he went to San Diego, where he intended to engage in the dry goods business. but, finding the town too small for his success, he set up shop in Los Angeles instead, on Aliso Street, a main road to and from such places as San Gabriel, El Monte and San Bernardino. He and a cousin, Maurice Kremer, were partners in the business in a row of shops called Mellus Row, later called the Bell Block, or Bell's Row, on the southeast corner of Los Angeles Street, until Kremer sold his share to Timoteo Wolfskill. In 1867 Lazard moved the business to 53 Main Street, where he named the store as The City of Paris. This was where elegant Los Angeles women sought the latest thing in French fashion. Lazard sold the company in 1874 to Eugene Meyer & Co.
Water.
In 1868, the City Council relinquished its rights to the water in the Los Angeles River in favor of businessmen Lazard, John S. Griffen and Prudent Beaudry, and the three created the Los Angeles City Water Company. The contract lapsed in 1898.
Banking.
Although the international banking firm of Lazard Frères and Company has stated it was founded in 1848 by three brothers in New Orleans, Louisiana, and later moved to San Francisco, other sources give the following story:
As there was no bank in Los Angeles in the mid-19th Century, the residents either kept their money at home or confided it to the Catholic nuns in a convent at Alameda Street and Macy Street. When Solomon's brother Eugène Isaac Meyer joined him in Los Angeles in 1859, Solomon followed the example of his brothers who were directing financial houses in Paris and Strasbourg: He opened a deposit window in his store under the name of Lazard et Frères, "a private banking firm that still exists, with branches around the world."
Still another version:
A famed international banking firm grew out of a homely adobe store which bore the sign, "Lazard Frères," and which resulted from the arrival in 1859 of A. Lazard to join his brother, S. Lazard, who, with a cousin, Maurice Kremer, had become a popular merchant in Los Angeles.
Public service.
Lazard was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council in 1854 and again in 1861–62, and in 1873 he was the first president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. In addition:
When Los Angeles suffered a smallpox epidemic in 1863, the Hebrew Benevolent Society's Committee on Charity, headed by Solomon Lazard, allotted $150 of the society's funds for the relief of the indigent sick and assumed the responsibility of collecting and distributing additional funds to aid the impoverished victims, many of them Mexicans or Indians.

The village got its name from a temple on a hill in the village. As told by the priest, this temple is more than 450 years old. Long ago, people in the surrounding villages established Thimmaraya Swamy in this place and started offering their prayers. This was more than 450 years ago and there are no records of these details. However, when Kempegowda started ruling Bangalore, one of his close associates was ruling this place and the surrounding areas. One day, lord Thimmaraya swamy himself appeared in his dreams asking him to renovate this place, as it was in a dilapidated state. That was when the ruler decided to renovate the temple. The family of the current priests here, have been offering poojas from almost the time the ruler renovated this place. 
This place is located on a hill surrounded by rocks and a fort. Along with lord Thimmarayaswamy, Bhoodevi and Mahalakshmi are also placed here. You will also see a statue of Garuda in the courtyard. Apart from these, there is also a Kashi Vishwanath temple right beside. There is also a pond located atop the hill. You can have a beautiful view of Electronic City from the hill. This place is located on the way in between Electronic City and Bannerghatta.

CheMin

CheMin, short for Chemistry and Mineralogy, is an instrument located in the interior of the "Curiosity" rover, that is exploring the surface of Gale crater on Mars. David Blake, from NASA Ames Research Center, is the Principal Investigator.
CheMin will identify and quantify the minerals present in rocks and soil delivered to it by the rover's robotic arm. By determining the mineralogy in rocks and soils, CheMin will assess the involvement of water in their formation, deposition, or alteration. In addition, CheMin data will be useful in the search for potential mineral biosignatures, energy sources for life or indicators for past habitable environments.
CheMin aboard the "Curiosity" rover on Mars won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award.
Description.
CheMin is an X-ray powder diffraction instrument that also has X-ray fluorescence capabilities. CheMin does not require the use of liquid reagents, instead, it utilizes a microfocus cobalt X-ray source, a transmission sample cell and an energy-discriminating X-ray sensitive CCD to produce simultaneous 2-D X-ray diffraction patterns and energy-dispersive histograms from powdered samples. Raw CCD frames are processed into data products on board the rover to reduce the data volume. These data products are transmitted to Earth for further processing analyses.
In operation, a collimated X-ray source will produce and direct a beam through a transmission sample cell containing powdered material. An X-ray sensitive CCD (charge-coupled device) imager is positioned on the opposite side of the sample from the source and directly detects X-rays diffracted or fluoresced by the sample. The CCD can measure the charge generated by each photon, and hence its energy. Diffracted X-rays strike the detector and are identified by their energy, producing a two-dimensional image that constitutes the diffraction pattern of the sample. Both crystalline and amorphous materials can be analyzed in this fashion. 
A maximum of 65 mm3 of sample material is delivered to a vibrated funnel system that penetrates the rover deck, although only about 10 mm3 of material is required to fill the sample cell which is transparent with a disc-shaped volume, with an 8 mm diameter and 175 µm thickness. The funnel contains a 1 mm mesh screen to limit the particle size. Five permanent cells are loaded with calibration standards; these are single minerals or synthetic ceramic. Each analysis may take up to 10 hours, spread out over two or more Martian nights.

Vaupés Arch

The Vaupés Arch is a hydrographic feature in the geology of Colombia. The Vaupés Arch forms the major drainage divide in the southern extent of the "llanos" region of eastern Colombia and the western slopes of the Guiana Shield in Venezuela. The Vaupés Arch is the result of an episode of tectonic uplift that occurred approximately 8 to 10 Ma. The rise of the Vaupés Arch divided the basin of the Amazon from the headwaters of the Orinoco for the first time. Much of the Arch is now buried under thick sediments washed from the Andes. Shifting meanders of the area's numerous waterways have spread these sediments evenly over the flat alluvial plain, which has very little relief. In modern times the Casiquiare canal, to the south of the Arch, reconnects the two headwater basins, the Upper Orinoco and the Upper Rio Negro, a major Amazon tributary.

Michael Bisio

Michael Bisio (March 4, 1955 Troy, New York) is an American jazz double bass player, composer and bandleader.
Biography.
He earned a Bachelor of Music from the University of Washington in 1979. His teachers include James Harnett, Bill Smith, Stuart Dempster, David Cobb, James Harnett, Barry Green, and Roger Scott.
Bisio's fusion jazz compositions draw heavily on avant garde music while sometimes including elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music. Bisio can walk a bass line with a deep swing rooted in a jazz aesthetic. Bisio avoids categorizations of music that fuse tradition with unique and unexplored realms of jazz.
Bisio focuses on collective improvisation, and pays particular attention to how each band member interacts with the group as a whole. Many musicians who have worked with him later went on to impressive careers. As a performer, Bisio is a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument's most proficient players.
Discography.
As a composer.
Bisio has composed over one hundred works of various forms and lengths for the ensembles under his leadership and many of his associates. These pieces have been performed in clubs, concert venues, and festivals. They have been broadcast over assorted media. Most have been recorded, some were composed for films and theater, and one found its way to animation.
In his book "Jackson Street After Hours", Paul De Barros described Bisio as one of the preeminent heirs to Seattle's earthy yet innovative tradition and marked his compositional style as "a spare, bluesy sound, the sweet- and-sour timbres favored by Charles Mingus."
He composed the music for Karl Krogstadt's feature film, "Strings". "Beat Angel", a film by Randy Allred starring Vincent Balestri, features Bisio's compositions and improvisations. In his film "Time & Object", animation artist Bernard Roddy uses "Something Different" from "Zebulon" as the score. He composed music for "Music for American Voices: Bukowski, Micheline and the First Amendment", a play written and performed by Vincent Balestri.
Recording artist.
Bisio appears on over 60 CDs, leading on 11 CDs and co-leading on another 10. His recorded output has consistently met with critical praise. Michael's first international release, "In Seattle", (Silkheart), was chosen as one of the "Best Jazz Records of 1980s" in the Village Voice. His most recent recording is a duet with Matthew Shipp called "Floating Ice".

Palio di Parma

The Palio di Parma is a festival that is held once a year in the northern Italian town of Parma, and traces back to the ancient "Scarlet Run"". The Palio is normally hold on the third weekend of September.
History.
The origin of this festival can be reconducted to 1314 as reported by Giovanni Del Giudice in the "Chronicon Parmense", talking about a festival hold to honour the engagement between Giberto III Da Correggio, ruler of Parma from 1303 to 1316, and Engelenda Rossi, also called Maddalena Rossi di San Secondo daughter of Guglielmo Rossi and Donella da Carrara rulers of Padova. This brought to an end of the several fight among their noble families wanting to dominate Parma. On that day, all the enemy families of Giberto Da Correggio were allowed to return in Parma, and even some prisoners gained back freedom. The games consisted in several competition with medieval weapons and horses.
The festival was held every year on 15 August, from the fourteenth century to Napoleon's arrival in the nineteenth century.
Nowadays.
Starting from 1978 the competition was brought to a new life. The town is divided in 5 different areas called "Porte", referring to the ancient doors which allowed to enter in the town from the walls of the town. Each of them forms a different team. There are 3 running competitions, one for men, one for women and one for children riding donkeys. In each of them the door try to win a painting showing one of the monuments of the town and Holy Mary, protector of Parma.

<doc id="36817859" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36817859" title="The Void (philosophy)">
The Void (philosophy)

The Void is the philosophical concept of nothingness manifested. The notion of The Void is closely affiliated, though not exclusive, to several realms of metaphysics, including agnosticism, existentialism, monoism, and nihilism. The Void is also prevalent in numerous facets of psychology, notably logotherapy.
The manifestation of nothingness is closely associated with the contemplation of emptiness, and with human attempts to identify and personify it. As such, the concept of The Void, and ideas similar to it, have a significant and historically evolving presence in artistic and creative expression, as well as in academic, scientific and philosophical debate surrounding the nature of the human condition.
Perhaps one of the central paradoxes of all concepts of the Void is that it is not possible to speak about emptiness using language. This is akin to Laozi's idea in the "Tao Te Ching" that the Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao, or Wittgenstein's "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" in the "Tractatus Logico Philosophicus". Perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of the human condition is, however, our perennial desire to discuss something (or rather, lack of something) that remains ultimately elusive and impossible to entirely encapsulate through the compartmentalising process implicit in words. Eckhart Tolle has alluded to this problem of language by suggesting that he uses words as signposts to point towards the 'something' (or 'nothing') that cannot be described by those words themselves.
In this sense, knowledge or experience of the Void could be said to actually be unknowing. In Western mystical traditions, it was often argued that the transcendent 'Ground of Being' could therefore be approached through aphairesis, a form of negation.
Background.
The Void as a cognomen is not easily defined, as the word itself means "empty" or "without content." The concept of The Void has existed since the dawn of philosophy. Aristotle, in Book IV of "Physica", denied its existence with his rejection of finite entities.
Metaphysics.
The British philosopher Paul Brunton was one of the first Western philosophers to consider the notion of The Void as metaphysical fact.
Peter Matthiessen in 'The Snow Leopard' (1978) described an experience of sitting on rocks in the Himalayas as leading to an awareness of a Void at the centre, or the source, of phenomenal existence: "These hard rocks instruct my bones in what my brain could never grasp in the Heart Sutra, that 'form is emptiness and emptiness is form' - the Void, the emptiness of blue-black space, contained in everything."
Henry Kannberg in "Uncertainty is Principal" (2014) describes a void as the source of all being which cannot be described linguistically, arguing that it is not knowable on an empirical basis, since the empirical involves the phenomenal world whose source is the mysterious entity or rather source of entities (perhaps called the 'noumenal' - which, according to Kant, we cannot know - or a host of other names, but again we cannot use language in this area according to Kannberg).
For Ken Wilber in "Spectrum of Consciousness" (1977), the Void is not mere nothingness, and is therefore distinct from something that can be subsumed into the category of nihilism, and is instead "Reality before we slice it up into conceptualism". Here he explores the idea of Sunyata, which cannot be "called void or not void; or both or neither" but can be referred to as 'the Void' with, again, the proviso that it exists beyond the limit of language.
Stanislav Grof's distinction between holotropic and hylotropic experience is important here, with the former encapsulating experiences which connect to the Void.
Religious and spiritual conceptions.
The Void is also an important concept in martial arts such as Aikido.
Astronomy, math, and Science.
Particle physics.
Atomic physics, according to Brunton, has proven that the world has "derived from a mysterious No-thing."
A similar line of argument is explored by Frank Close in "The Void" (2007) who discusses the concept of 'empty space' from Aristotle through to Newton, Mach, Einstein and beyond (including the idea of an 'aether' and current examinations of the Higgs field). There may be a problem of language here, however (one that Laozi or Henry Kannberg might identify) because what Close is exploring is in a sense perhaps still a presence, rather than a lack of it, and one involving a large amount of virtual particles and antiparticles that erupt spontaneously into being, with the possibility of hidden dimensions that we are previously unaware of. This may not, in fact, be the Void itself, but a layer of emptiness that perhaps points towards 'it' (or 'not-it'). After all, a domain in which there are both particles and anti-particles is one characterised by duality (for example, the duality of 'exists' and 'doesn't exist'), whereas an absolute or ultimate Void may rather be one characterised by non-duality.
For some people, science may never be able to help us understand the Void, because science is fundamentally empirical in its approach, and the Void is in some mysterious way separate from the empirical and phenomenal world (and is outside space, time and causality and not, therefore, knowable within those categories). For others, progressions and breakthroughs in science help us to understand the philosophical and metaphysical ideas of emptiness that have developed in numerous forms throughout human history.

Edith Diehl

Edith Diehl (–) is an American bookbinder and author of "Bookbinding, its Background and Technique" (Rinehart and Co., 1946), a classic text and manual on the history and craft of bookbinding in two volumes (republished in editions by Kennicat Press, 1965; Hacker Art Books, 1979; Dover, 1980). In 1947, in recognition of her accomplishments, Diehl was made an Honorary Life Member of the Guild of Book Workers. 
Diehl is also known for her wartime works, having closed her studio in 1914 to become Director of Workrooms for the American Red Cross. In 1917, she was asked by trustees of Wellesley College to become Director of the Woman's Land Army of America Training Camp and Experiment Station, which led to her appointment as National Director at the headquarters in Washington, D.C. where she wrote a handbook for use in the national camps.
Biography.
Diehl was born in Brewster, New York (within the Town of Southeast, in Putnam County), the daughter of Philip (a baker and ice-cream parlor owner) and Josephine Lee Diehl. (A Ralph Diehl, possibly a brother, is cited as Brewster Bakery owner and postmaster in 1923 in Br). She attended Drew Seminary in Carmel, New York. Philip was a German immigrant, and bilingual in German and English. She studied philosophy at the University of Jena, Germany at the age of twenty-two after leaving Wellesley. 
Edith was one of the founders of the Brewster Public Library.
Bookbinding career.
Training.
About finding bookbinding as a career, it was reported that she "grew so fond of books at Wellesley (...) that she decided to be one of those who give first editions a new lease on life by putting them in comfortable and at the same time decorative surroundings." In interview, she herself stated: "I loved books so much that I wanted to be able to put them in bindings myself. I took up bookbinding in 1902, and studied at the Evelyn Nordhoff Bindery in New York City. " She began formal studies in New York City with Florence Foote at the (Evelyn) Nordhoff Bindery in 1902, and soon moved to England to study in the studios of Nordhoff's teacher Thomas J. Cobden-Sanderson, his student Douglas Cockerell, and the firm of Sangorski & Sutcliffe. After two years in England, she moved to Paris to work at the ateliers of Mercier, and Domont, then to the ateliers of DeBuhl (DeBuyl) and Jacobs in Brussels and then returned to England to study at Westminster Abbey.
Professional Studios.
Diehl stated, ″it was only after five years of intensive study and practical work that I hung out my shingle.″ Diehl had bookbinding studios in various sequential locations in New York City during the first half of the twentieth century, moving uptown by degrees from Gramercy to Sutton Place, with interruptions during both World Wars. For a time, she went to work as the house director of binding for William Edwin Rudge, supervising the binding production of books by Bruce Rogers.
Examples of works.
Equipment, Tools and Marks.
Jeffrey Peachey, a book conservator, tool maker and historian [http://negbw.wordpress.com/tag/jeff-peachey/] has published blog posts on one of Diehl's backing hammers.
Bindings in public collections.
An example of a signed Diehl binding, the "Sonnets of Michael Angelo Buonarroti" as described in "The Sun" article cited, is available at The New York Public Library, Spencer Collection. Examples of plaquettes and designs are available at the Morgan Library & Museum.
Archives.
Edith Diehl's papers, including correspondence, notes and some photographs (photographer unknown) are held at the Archives of American Art, the Morgan Library & Museum and The Grolier Club.

1976–77 Leeds United A.F.C. season

During the 1976–77 English football season, Leeds United A.F.C. competed in the Football League First Division.
Season summary.
Leeds United's league form was inconsistent and they could only muster fifteen league wins all season. Their start was poor with one win in their first nine games. They recovered a little through the autumn but continued to struggle for goals. Leeds though faded away and finished in 10th, their lowest finish since 1964.
On a more positive note, Leeds went on a brilliant FA Cup run they beat Norwich City, Birmingham City, Manchester City and Wolves to reach the semi finals, where they were drawn with Manchester United. They conceded two early goals at Hillsborough and even after Allan Clarke pulled a goal back, Leeds couldn't recover.
There was an inconsolable feeling about the club as the season drew to a close. The crowd of 16,891 who watched Leeds draw 1-1 with West Ham United on 26 April at Elland Road was the lowest since the club's return to the First Division, bearing testimony to the depression felt by the Leeds fans.

Oratio Imperata

Oratio Imperata (Latin: "Obligatory Prayer") is a set of Roman Catholic invocative prayers consisting of a liturgical action and a short, general prayer which the local ordinary or prelate of the church may publicly pray when a grave need or calamity occurs.
Common reasons for the religious invocation of the prayer are natural calamities such as storms, snow and drought while rare circumstances which merit the prayer are wars, plague and the disruption of public peace in society. The prayers are customarily invoked by an Archdiocese on behalf of overwhelming popular requests, and is authorised by a high-ranking prelate or Metropolitan Archbishop.
History.
The customary tradition of reciting such prayers are rooted in Apostolic age, when lay people asked the help and assistance of their bishops in the time of natural calamity, war or any grave public danger to society. In the Middle Ages, various saints (i.e. Saint Isidore the Farmer were invoked for the assistance of granting rain while Saint Roque was invoked for dire calamities and the black plague. 
In the present Roman Catholic discipline, any "collect" prayers from the Holy Mass may be prescribed by the local ordinary as this type of prayer. The prayer itself cannot be a permanent religious recitation, but rather only for used for a short period of time of need. The prayers are often recited "post-communion" or after the conclusion or final benediction of the Holy Mass. When the prayer itself is asked, composed, or canonically authorised by the Pope, it can also merit a plenary indulgence. 
The invocative prayers prescribed as Oratio Imperata are:
In very rare cases of enduring public calamities lasting a longer time, (i,e. national war, calamitous plague, etc), the local ordinary may indeed impose a suitable Oratio Imperata for an extended period:
Difficulty of approval.
At times, the approval to recite the prayers on a diocesan level have been known to be difficult to obtain, usually causing the faithful to rather demand in large numbers to an Archdiocese to release an Oratio Imperata. The most commonly authorised prayer is "Oratio Imperata Ad Fluviam Petendam", in hopes of asking for rain in times of severe drought. Another one is "Oratio Imperata Ad Calamitam et Bellonam", for casualties of war.
In the Republic of the Philippines, the release of such prayers is often requested during monsoon season and is primarily reported in various television and media outlets.
Within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in June 2008, a special prayer for the request of more priestly vocations merited the request for the prayers, recited post-communion during Sunday Masses in the San Fernando Valley but was prohibited in being prayed during weekly masses.

Ursula Heinzelmann

Ursula Heinzelmann, born in Berlin in 1963, is a freelance German food and wine writer, a sommelière and a gastronome. She was a good cook before she had learned to read, according to a radio interview on "HR2-Kultur", and she was a practitioner before she began to write about food: from 1986 to 1991 she ran a small hotel and restaurant on the shores of Lake Constance, and soon afterwards a delicatessen in Berlin specializing in fine French cheeses and wines. She has twice been awarded the annual Sophie Coe Prize in Food History at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, most recently in 2006. In 2008 she won the Prix du Champagne Lanson for her wine journalism on "Slow Food Magazin". 
In English she has written a book-length survey of German food, "Food Culture in Germany", published by Greenwood Press in 2008. In Germany, however, she is best known for her series of three books on real and traditional food, beginning with "Erlebnis Essen" (2006). This includes a comparative tasting of top quality French and German butter in which the renowned "appellation d'origine protégée" butter of Isigny-Sainte-Mère met strong competition. The series continues with "Erlebnis Kochen" (subtitled "Manifesto for a cuisine without recipes": 2007). The third volume, "Erlebnis Käse und Wein" (2009), takes the form of a "voyage of discovery", an exploration of German cheese, German wine and how well the two go together. She and her husband, the wine journalist Stuart Pigott, took up the same theme in illustrated articles for the popular magazine "Für Sie", "Cheese and Wine from Germany" and "Cheese and Wine Ideas". 
As a journalist she has written in English for "Saveur" and in German for "Slow Food Magazin" and "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung". Her recipes from the "Frankfurter Allgemeine" were collected in book form in 2010. To "Effilee" she contributes a series on cheese, "Gegessener Käse", ranging from Israel and Hungary to Corsica, Britain and the United States. Her portrait of the American food historian Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, published in the same journal, has been described as "a pearl of journalism".

Starlite (video game)

Starlite (formerly associated with Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond) is the title of a multiplayer online game which , is being developed by NASA with Project Whitecard Enterprises Inc. and WisdomTools Enterprises. The game world will be set in the future (2035 or later), with the ability to explore planned and possible near-future moon missions, which is facilitated by the use of NASA Learning Technologies, and Innovative Partnerships programs.
Other NASA Learning Technologies programs include Second Life's MOONWORLD and Moonbase Alpha [http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/ltp/games/moonbasealpha/index.html on the STEAM network, as well as a few others on different platforms going all the way back to the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) system of the 1980s.
Development timeline.
November 25, 2009 was the "pre-development start" date for the project.
On October 11, 2011, the Kickstarter pre-funding drive of an AMMB MMO successfully met its scheduled end. The goal of $25,000.00 to prove some commercial viability was greatly exceeded and a total of $46,719 was raised. This is very close to the initial (failed) drive goal of $50,000 which was held just prior to this drive. [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1763206385/astronaut-moon-mars-and-beyond-the-nasa-mmo-online]
June 1, 2012: At Project Whitecard Studios, Development began with 14 developers.
On July 24, 2012, Project Whitecard Studios Inc. signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA HQ to create "Starlite Digital Badges," STEM Education badges in conjunction with NASA and Mozilla. This is relevant because the same team will assign open-source digital badges using a customMozilla Open Badges platform from within the Starlite game (a unique concept) being developed for Mobile.
August 2012 - July 15, 2012: Project Whitecard Studios develops a 20 minute prototype called "Starlite"
October 15, 2013: The fuller and larger team (TBA) continues development on Starlite.
The team plans to release a 20 minute adventure in late 2013, a "membership-alpha" in mid 2014, and a full game in late 2014.
Justification.
The game is being developed because the belief in games used as educational tools is gaining recognition, and NASA is in a position to develop an online game that functions as a persistent, synthetic environment supporting education as a laboratory. It is the same reason pilots train with flight simulators.
The initiative to develop a NASA MMO comes from the office of NASA Learning Technologies at NASA Goddard, with studies initiated by Daniel Laughlin.
The award of the Space Act Agreement was the result of a contested RFP (more details needed).

Richard Nicholls Worth

Richard Nicholls Worth (19 July 1837− 3 July 1896) was a miscellaneous writer and geologist. He was apprenticed in 1851 at the "Devonport and Plymouth Telegraph", becoming a member of the staff in 1858. In 1863 he joined the "Western Morning News", remaining with it till 1865. In 1866 and the following year he lived at Newcastle upon Tyne as editor of the "Northern Daily Express", but, finding the climate too trying, rejoined the staff of the "Western Morning News" in 1867. In 1877 he became associated with Messrs. Brendon & Son, printers and publishers, of Plymouth, receiving a testimonial of plate by public subscription in Devon and Cornwall for his services as a journalist. In this business he remained till his death, though he continued to contribute occasionally, not only to the local press but also to "Nature", the "Academy", and other periodicals.
Worth devoted his spare time to investigating the history and geology of the west of England. Patient and exact, dreading hasty theorising, he did much for the history, archaeology, and geology of Devon and Cornwall.
He was twice president of the Plymouth Association, and in 1891 of the Devonshire Association. A portrait in oils, painted by Lane in 1873, is in possession of the family.
Personal life.
Worth was the eldest son of Richard Worth, a builder of Devonport, by his wife Eliza, daughter of Richard Nicholls of the same place. He married, 22 March 1860, at Stoke Damerel, Devonshire, Lydia Amelia, daughter of Richard Davies of the Dockyard, Devonport. He died suddenly at Shaugh Prior, where he was temporarily resident, on 3 July 1896, and was buried in the village churchyard. One son and one daughter survived him.
Works.
Altogether Worth published about 140 papers between 1869 and his death, mostly historical, and in the proceedings of local societies; some of the scientific papers appeared in the "Quarterly Journal" of the Geological Society of London, of which he became a fellow in 1875. Besides a series of guide-books and several smaller works, he was the author of:

Haystak

Born Jason Winfree in Nashville, TN, to teenage parents and raised by his grandparents, Haystak grew up among impoverished surroundings. He turned to crime as he came of age, ultimately getting busted for bringing Valium and cocaine to school at age 15. After serving a two-year sentence, Haystak turned to rap music as his salvation. Initially known best for being a huge white-boy rapper from Tennessee, Haystak overcame his anomalous status with time as listeners learned to cherish his sincerity. Unlike many of his Southern peers, Haystak did not embrace materialism and greed; he rapped about his life as so-called "white trash," exploring the social dimensions of being white and underprivileged in the South. Few gave the mammoth country boy a chance to succeed, however.
In the late '90s he defied the odds by aligning himself with a local rap label, Street Flavor, and producers Kevin Grisham and Sonny Paradise. The partnership resulted in Mak Million, Haystak's 1998 debut album, followed two years later by Car Fulla White Boys. By this point Haystak had garnered a substantial regional following, and underground hardcore rap publication Murder Dog especially championed the blossoming rapper. The ensuing buzz attracted Koch Records, who signed Haystak and re-released Car Fulla White Boys in late summer 2000. Two years later, Koch released Haystak's third album, "The Natural".
Haystak released his latest solo album entitled "Easy 2 Hate" on November 30, 2010 through Haystak, Inc.
Haystak is married and has two children. In addition to rap music, he embarked on an acting career; he was featured in the documentary "White Boyz Can't Rap" and the film "Hustle & Flow" where he played the DJ named Mickey.
Haystak collaborated with Nashville, Tennessee native JellyRoll on the album "Strictly Business" in 2011 which peaked at 67 on the Billboard 200 Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, and 16 on the Top Heatseekers Albums Chart. The sequel "Business As Usual" was released on 11/19/13.
Haystak was originally from Lebanon, Tennessee. He claims Nashville because Lebanon is outside Nashville. Haystak's latest song is "Where I've Been", based on his life and what he has learned.
On Dec 17, 1997 was accused of Statutory Rape. He was arrested on this charge Jan 9, 2004. Court records indicate the case was closed. Again, he was accused of rape on Oct 19, 1997. He was arrested on this charge on Feb 17, 2006. Haystak was convicted of assault, fear of bodily injury after he pled guilty. Sentenced to 11 months and 29 days. The sentence was suspended, and Haystak was placed on supervised probation for the 11 months and 29 days.

Caerwood And Ashberry Goose House ( ) is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1991. The site was previously notified as Caerwood, Tidenham and lies within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Location and habitat.
The site is notified for its nationally important breeding roosts of Lesser horseshoe bats (one of three sites in Gloucestershire). It lies at the top of the wooded gorge slopes of the Wye Valley, and at the southernmost tip of the Forest of Dean.
The site comprises one of a series of Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley (Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire). These sites support (between them) breeding and hibernation roosts for Lesser and Greater horseshoe bats. This is of European importance. Other sites in the group in Gloucestershire (all of which are SSSIs) include the breeding sites of Blaisdon Hall, Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar and Sylvan House Barn. Hibernation sites include Buckshraft Mine & Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel, Devil's Chapel Scowles, Old Bow And Old Ham Mines, Westbury Brook Ironstone Mine, and Wigpool Ironstone Mine.
The deciduous woodlands and sheltered valleys of the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley provide a good feeding area, and the underground systems provide roosting and breeding sites. A ring of iron-ore bearing Carboniferous Limestone in the Forest of Dean has created a series of ancient and more recent mines which provide hibernation sites. The citations for the series of sites provide common information.
Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Bat Sites/ Safleoedd Ystlumod Dyffryn Gwy a Fforest y Ddena are recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.
Building space.
The site comprises the roof spaces of two buildings which are used seasonally as lesser horseshoe bat nursery roosts. There are indications that the site may have been used for over fifty years. The site is also used as a nursery roost by Pipistrelle bats" (Pipistrellus pipistrellus)".

Uncle Tom's Trail

Uncle Tom's Trail is a steep stairway descent from the south rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone to a viewpoint near the base of the Lower Yellowstone Falls in Yellowstone National Park. The trail was constructed in 1898 by park concessionaire, "Uncle Tom" H. F. Henderson when the Department of the Interior granted Henderson a permit to operate a ferry across the Yellowstone River. Henderson ferried park visitors across the Yellowstone River above the current site of the Chittenden Memorial Bridge then escorted them to the trail and they traveled down to the base of the Lower Falls via ladders and ropes. Upon their return, visitors were provided a picnic lunch on the south rim of the canyon before returning via the ferry. In 1903 when the original Chittenden Bridge was built, Henderson's ferry business began to decline. In 1905, when the government built a wooden stairway, visitors were increasingly unwilling to pay Henderson the $1 fee for the tour to the base of the falls. 1906 was the last year he operated tours in the canyon. The trail has been maintained and improved by the National Park Service to this day.

William Worth (scholar)

William Worth (1677−1742), was a classical scholar and divine.
Education and church.
He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 14 March 1691−2, but migrated to St. Edmund Hall, graduating B.A. on 17 Oct. 1695, and MA. on 4 July 1698. In 1702, on the nomination of Archbishop Tenison, he was elected fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, he was chaplain to the Bishop of Worcester in 1705, and on 14 Dec. 1705 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Worcester. He proceeded B.D. in 1705 and D.D. in 1719.
The value (5l.) of this archdeaconry in the king's books was greater than that of any preferment tenable with his fellowship. The warden of All Souls' College thereupon declared, on 7 Jan. 1706−7, that the fellowship was vacant. Worth appealed to Tenison against the warden's action, but on 12 June 1707 renounced the appeal. Bishop William Fleetwood was led to publish his ‘Chronicon Preciosum’ on the occasion of this dispute.
Worth retained this archdeaconry until his death in 1742, and combined with it from 17 Feb. 1715−16 the third canonry at Worcester. From 16 July 1707 to 1713 he held the rectory of Halford in Warwickshire. On 9 April 1713 he was collated to the rectory of Alvechurch, and on 11 July following to the rectory of Northfield, both in Worcestershire, and he enjoyed both these benefices, with his canonry and archdeaconry, until his death.
Writing and Editor.
Worth edited at Oxford in 1700 ‘Tatiani Oratio ad Grsecos. Hermiæ irrisio gentilium philosophorum,’ with his own annotations and those of many previous scholars. Hearne says that ‘most of the notes, with the dedication and preface, were written by Dr. John Mill (Collections, Oxford Hist. Soc. i. 40). Worth's notes to the tract of Hermias were included in the edition by J. C. Dommerich, which was printed at Halle in 1764. He greatly assisted Browne Willis in his account of Worcester Cathedral (Survey of Cathedrals, vol. i. p. vi), and extracts from his collections on Worcestershire are embodied in Nash's history of that county. Edward Dechair in his edition of the ‘Legatio pro Christianis’ (1706) of Athenagoras was much indebted to Worth for various readings in manuscripts (preface to edition). A letter from Worth to Potter, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, on the death of Dr. John Mill is in Lambeth MS. 933, art. 42, and a copy is in the British Museum Additional MS. 4292, art. 61. It is printed in the ‘Gentleman's Magazine’ (1801, ii. 587) and in H. J. Todd's ‘Brian Walton’ (i. 79−81).
Personal.
Worth was born at Penryn, Cornwall, and baptised at St. Gluvias, its parish church, on 20 Feb. 1676−7, was the second son of William Worth, merchant of Penryn, who died there on 22 Jan. 1689−90, aged 55, by his wife Jane, daughter and coheiress of Mr. Pennalerick. He died on 7 Aug. 1742, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral on 11 Aug. His wife was a Miss Price, and their only daughter, with a fortune of 60,000l., married on 3 March 1740, William Winsmore, mayor of Worcester in 1739−40 (Gent. Mag. 1740, p. 147).

Filtration camp system in Chechnya

Filtration camps or filtration points (the official name) were used by the Russian federal forces for their mass internment centers during the Chechen Wars in 1994-1996 and then again between 1999 and 2003.
"Filtration" system.
The original "filtration camp" system, run by the Soviet Union's NKVD, was established in 1945 by the order of Joseph Stalin for Soviet citizens that have been previously held prisoner by Germans during World War II. More than four million former Soviet POWs and civilian internees (mostly former forced laborers for Germany) went through hundreds of such "filtration camps" (sometimes also referred to as "control-filtration camps", "screening-filtration camps" or "verification-filtration camps") during the late 1940s.
The term "filtration point" re-appeared during the First Chechen War as name of the facilities illegally created for the purpose of holding the persons detained by the federal forces in the course of an operation "to restore constitutional order" on the territory of Chechen Republic in 1994-1996. During the Second Chechen War, beginning in 1999, some of the "filtration" facilities got legitimate status of investigative isolators (SIZO) subordinated to the Ministry of Justice and temporary detention isolators (IVS) subordinated to the Interior Ministry, but with an unclear legal status and no apparent basis in the criminal code of the Russian Federation. 
According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, "by the most modest estimations", the overall number of those having passed through the established and "ad hoc" "filtration points" reaches at least 200,000 people (out of Chechnya's population of less than one million), of whom "practically all" have been subjected to beatings and torture, and some were summarily executed. According to Memorial, the purpose of the "filtration" system in Chechnya, besides being part of the general state terror system for suppression and intimidation of the population, was to create a network of informers through the enforced recruitation, and was characterised by its non-selectivity, that is by arbitrary arrests and mass detentions of innocent people.
In October 2000, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published its 99-page investigative report "Welcome to Hell", detailing how Russian troops have detained thousands of Chechens, "many of them were detained arbitrarily, with no evidence of wrongdoing. Guards at detention centers systematically beat Chechen detainees, some of whom have also been raped or subjected to other forms of torture. Most were released only after their families paid large bribes to Russian officials." HRW noted that despite the European Union-sponsored United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution urging Russia to launch a national commission of inquiry that would establish accountability for abuse, the Russian authorities did not launch any "credible and transparent effort to investigate these abuses and bring the perpetrators to justice."
"Filtration points" in the Second Chechen War.
One of main, and the best known, filtration camps in Chechnya was the Chernokozovo detention center, set up in a former prison in 1999. Chernokozovo was subject of a significant attention in 2000, as well as at least two illegal detention and torture related rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (the cases of the Chitayev brothers in 2007 and of Zura Bitiyeva in 2008, the latter also including the subsequent summary execution of her and her family).
In 2000, Amnesty International identified the following "filtration camps": the detention facility in Kadi-Yurt, a makeshift detention facility in a school in Urus-Martan, and other makeshift camps in various locations in Chechnya, including at a fruit warehouse in Tolstoy-Yurt, at a poultry processing plant and the basement of the "Chekhkar" café in Chiri-Yurt, and in the capital Grozny. The facilities outside of Chechnya included the prison hospital and the SIZO at Pyatigorsk in Stavropol Territory.
According to Memorial, other long-term "filtration points" run by federal forces included the notorious "Titanic" facility located between Aleroy and Tsentoroy, the site of a "disappearance" of many people. Illegal prisons were created at the places of deployment of military units or special units of the Ministry of Interior and the prisoners kept in them were not officially registered anywhere neither as being detained. The largest and best known of them was located at the military base at Khankala, where many prisoners were held in the holes dug in the ground. In addition, temporary "filtration camps" were being set up in the open fields or in the abandoned premises at the outskirts of the towns and villages in the course of numerous "mopping-up" ("zachistka") special operations.
In 2006, Russia's human rights groups produced a documentary evidence of a secret torture center in the basement of a former school for deaf children in Oktyabrsokye district of Grozny, which they alleged had been used by a unit of the Russian special police OMON that had been stationed nearby during the early 2000s to hold, torture and kill hundreds of people, whose bodies were then dumped through Chechnya (the unit's member Sergei Lapin has been convicted in 2005 of torturing the Chechen student Zelimkhan Murdalov, one of the "disappeared" who remains unaccounted for). The activists said they collected the evidence just in time before building housing the cellar has since been demolished in an apparent crude cover-up attempt.

Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon

The Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon (SSNP) (, "Al-Ḥizb Al-Sūrī Al-Qawmī Al-'Ijtimā'ī", often referred to in French as "Parti populaire syrien" or "Parti social nationaliste syrien"), is a secular nationalist political party operating in Lebanon, a branch of pan-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party. It advocates subsuming Lebanon into a Greater Syrian nation state spanning the Fertile Crescent.
Founded in Beirut in 1932 as a national liberation organization hostile to French colonialism, the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted coup d'etats in 1949 and 1961 following which it was thoroughly repressed. It was active in the resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon from 1982 to 2000 while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon. 
Foundation and early years.
The SSNP was founded in Lebanon by Antun Saadeh, a Syrian nationalist philosopher from the town of Dhour el Shweir. He had emigrated to Brazil in 1919 and was involved in both Arabic-language journalism and Syrian nationalist activity. He returned to Lebanon in 1930 where he was a journalist and German teacher in the American University of Beirut. 
In November 1932, he secretly established the first nucleus of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which operated underground for the first three years of its existence. In 1933, it started publishing a monthly journal called "Al-Majalla" which was distributed in the American University of Beirut. The articles written in that journal and the speeches given by Saadeh consolidated the ideological basis of the party, and contributed to its popularity. 
Its open hostility to colonialism led to six months in prison for creating a clandestine party in 1936. He was also accused in the trial of having been in contact with the fascist movements of Germany and Italy, but the charge was dropped as a letter was addressed from Germany denying any relationships. It is during his months in prison that Saadeh laid down the final ideological foundations of the party in "The Genesis of Nations". 
Saadeh emigrated again to Brazil in 1938 and afterwards to Argentina, only to return to Lebanon in 1947 following the country's independence from the French in 1943. By that time, the SSNP had grown exponentially and had clashed on many occasions with its primary ideological rival, the Kataeb Party, which was committed to the notion of Lebanon in its French borders.
The SSNP rejected this state of Lebanon on the basis that the borders outlining the newly created states were fictitious, resulting from colonialism, and do not reflect any historical and social realities. The party claimed that Greater Syria as defined by Saadeh represents the national ideal encompassing the historical people of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, bound together by a clearly defined geography and a common historical, social and cultural development path. Furthermore, and with the start of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948, Saadeh radicalized the party's Anti-Zionist stance by declaring that ""Our struggle with the enemy is not a struggle for borders but for existence"". 
On 4 July 1949, a year after the declaration of the establishment of the state of Israel and the Nakba, and a response to a series of aggressions perpetrated by the Kataeb-backed central government, the SSNP attempted its first revolution. Following a violent crackdown by government forces, Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za'im in an attempt to obtain his support, although he was handed over to Lebanese authorities, and executed on July the 8, 1949.
From Confrontation to accommodation: The 1950–1960 years.
Following the execution of Saadeh and the arrest of its high-ranking leaders, the party remained underground until it started resurfacing with the events that transpired during the 1950–1960 period. With the outbreak of the Cold War and the rise of Marxist and communist influences supported by the USSR, the SSNP found itself facing a new ideological adversary, especially that most left-wing movements in the Middle-East rallied around Gamal Abd El Nasser and Arab nationalism. An ideological clash ensued, as Nasser and most left-wing organizations in the Arab world advocated Arab nationalism, the SSNP retained its commitment to Syrian nationalism.
The party objected to the declaration of The United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria, and during the Lebanon crisis of 1958, party members sided with the government and then-president Camille Chamoun, fighting against the Arab nationalist rebels in northern Lebanon and in Mount Lebanon. The party was subsequently legalized.
Second Coup d'Etat and repression: 1961–1975.
In 1961, and under the semi-authoritarian rule of General Fouad Chehab, the party launched an abortive coup attempt in Lebanon, resulting in renewed proscription and the imprisonment of many of its leaders.
The Lebanese Civil War: 1975–1990.
With the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the SSNP militias fought alongside the nationalist and leftist forces allied in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), against the Phalangists and their right-wing allies of the Lebanese Front. The SSNP conceived the Lebanese Civil War as the inevitable result of the divisions of the Syrian nation into small states such as Lebanon for the benefit of feudal leaders that would further fragment the nation into sectarian parcels and shun away from a liberation war against Israel, which the SSNP considered vital for the liberation-and-reclamation of Palestine, later to be known in SSNP dialect as "the occupied south of Greater Syria". The SSNP found its natural allies to be the Palestinian guerrillas, mainly Fatah and the PFLP as well as its former bitter enemies: the left-wing Arab nationalist movements, the Syrian Ba'ath Party, and the communists.
After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and subsequent rout of the leftist forces, a number of the leftist organizations regrouped to engage in resistance to the Israeli occupation. Along with the Lebanese Communist Party, the Communist Action Organization, and some smaller leftist groups, the SSNP played a prominent role in this. One of the best-known sparks of the resistance was the killing of two Israeli soldiers in the Wimpy Cafe on west Beirut's central Rue Hamra by party member Khalid Alwan. The party continues to commemorate this date. The FBI blames them for the assassination of Bachir Gemayel in 1982, the then-newly elected Lebanese President backed by the invading Israelis besieging Beirut.
In 1983, the party joined the Lebanese National Salvation Front established to oppose the abortive May 17 accord with Israel signed by Gemayel's brother and successor Amine Gemayel. Some party members were willing to sacrifice their lives through suicide attacks in resistance against Israel, the first being in 1985. A party member Sana'a Mehaidli, who committed a suicide attack at the age of 16 against an Israeli checkpoint in Lebanon, is considered "the progenitor of all female martyrs for the Palestinian cause". Diego Gambetta says that they can't be considered a terrorist organization because they only act against military targets, and that they should be considered a guerrilla organization.
Post Civil War Electoral performance.
The SSNP participated in the general elections following the civil war winning the following seats:
2008 Conflict.
During the 2008 conflict in Lebanon, at least 14 people were killed in the town of Halba, in the Akkar region of north Lebanon, as about 100 pro-Future Movement gunmen attacked an office of the SSNP. 10 of the dead were SSNP members, three were government loyalists and one was an Australian citizen of Lebanese descent on vacation in Lebanon, who was trying to get information at the SSNP offices about evacuating from the city. The Australian father of four, Fadi Sheikh, reportedly had his hands and feet cut off.
Ideology.
The Ideology of the SSNP is a mixture of pan-Syrian nationalism, secularism and economic corporatism.

Oliver Cromwell in popular culture

Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 – 3 September 1658) was an English military and political leader and later Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.
In literature.
The Posthumous execution of Cromwell, on the anniversary of the regicide in 1661, struck the imagination of the Italian writer, and State Secretary of Este court in Modena, Girolamo Graziani who involved himself since then in his masterpiece "Il Cromuele" (1671), a tragedy that deals with the theme of the dark cruel tyrant, (Oliver Cromwell) and the violated regality (Charles I of England's martyrdom). The plot is full of historical references as well as love affairs between the characters.
One of the earliest novels to feature Cromwell, Abbe Prevost's "Le philosophe anglais" (1731–39), portrays him as a hypocritical womaniser, a deceitful tyrant, and a coward. The protagonist of this novel, Mr Cleveland, is Cromwell's illegitimate son via one of Charles I's cast-off mistresses. Cromwell’s adoption by the French Romantic movement was typified by Victor Hugo's 1827 play "Cromwell", often considered to be symbolic of the French romantic movement, which represents Cromwell as a ruthless yet dynamic Romantic hero. A similar impression of a world-changing individual with a strong will and personality was provided in 1831 in the picture by French artist Hippolyte Delaroche, depicting the visit by Cromwell to the body of Charles I after the king’s execution.
"Twenty Years After", Alexandre Dumas' sequel to "The Three Musketeers", is set against the backdrop of the Second English Civil War. The four friends fight on opposing sides, two on behalf of Cromwell and two for Charles I. The main antagonist, Mordaunt, is portrayed as Cromwell's secretary and spy.
In Orson Scott Card's alternate history fantasy novel series "The Tales of Alvin Maker", one of Cromwell's physicians is depicted as a healer able to prevent his death and thus the subsequent English Restoration, although Cromwell himself does not appear in the series. Another similar fantasy novel series, "The Baroque Cycle" by Neal Stephenson, contains many references to Cromwell as well as extensive descriptions of his grass-roots supporters and their behaviour after the Restoration. The novel series begins in 1655, three years before Cromwell's death, but once again he does not appear in the novels. "The Adventures of Luther Arkwright", a comic-book fantasy adventure spanning countless alternative universes, depicts modern-day England as a fascist theocracy ruled by a descendant of Cromwell. Popular Australian fantasy author Kate Forsyth wrote Cromwell into her series "The Chain of Charms".
Cromwell appears as a character in the 1632 series by Eric Flint and collaborators. He first appears in the book 1633, where he has been imprisoned 'in advance' by Charles I of England, scared by reports of Cromwell's actions in our own timeline.
The Morganville Vampires novels feature Cromwell as a vampire.
A minor but important character in Robert Wilton's "Traitor's Field", this novel starts with the aftermath of the Battle of Preston in 1648 until Charles II's flight into exile on the continent; it was published by Corvus, an imprint of Atlantic Books, on May 1, 2013 (UK).

Henry Phillips (horticulturist)

Henry Phillips ( 1779 – 8 March 1840) was a botanist, horticultural writer and landscape gardener from the seaside resort of Brighton in England. After spending time as a banker and teacher in London and Sussex, he came to national attention for his botanical articles and books, and was renowned for his landscape gardening work in Brighton during its period of rapid growth. In the 1820s he became involved in several major schemes in the town and neighbouring Hove, encompassing gardens, conservatories and similar. His grandiose Anthaeum project, an elaborate indoor botanical garden topped by "the largest dome in the world", ended in disaster when the structure spectacularly collapsed just before its official opening.
Life.
Phillips was born in around 1779 in the West Sussex village of Henfield, possibly to James and Ann Philips who had a son named Henry baptised at Barcombe, East Sussex, on 15 October 1780. The first 40 years of his life were spent in London and Sussex: he worked for a bank in Worthing and lived in the town, then moved to Brighton with his wife who he had married in 1798 or 1800. In 1815 they moved to the Bayswater area of London, where Phillips opened "an academy for young gentlemen" and taught there. He and his wife returned to Brighton in 1823 and lived at Bedford Square on the seafront. Later they moved to nearby Regent Place.
During his time in Worthing and London, Phillips developed a strong interest in botany, horticulture and landscape gardening. By the 1820s, he was both locally and nationally known for his landscape gardening work and his writing, and he regularly gave botanical lectures in Brighton. His first book, "Pomarium Britannicum", was published in 1820, and he wrote several others in the 1820s. He joined The Royal Horticultural Society and, in 1825, the Linnean Society of London. In 1826, when painter John Constable came to Brighton on one of his regular visits to help improve his wife's ill health, he met Phillips and they became friends; Phillips advised him on the correct plants to paint in the hedgerows he was depicting in his latest painting, "The Cornfield".
In early 1831, the "Brighton Herald" newspaper stated that Phillips was due to sail on 1 February of that year to Caracas, where he would be appointed as the official botanist of Simón Bolívar's estate. Whether he did travel to South America or not is unknown, but Bolívar had died in December 1830. Around the same time, Phillips is believed to have designed the conservatory at Edward Cross's Surrey Zoological Gardens, which opened in 1831.
Phillips died at 26 Russell Square, Brighton, on 8 March 1840 at the age of 61. He was suffering from enteritis.
Projects.
Henry Phillips' reputation as a landscape gardener brought him much work in the Brighton and Hove area; his first commission came in 1822, while he was still living in London. Together with local architect Amon Henry Wilds he designed The Level, a triangular area of former common land between the Ditchling and Lewes Roads. It was owned by Thomas Read Kemp until he donated it to the people of Brighton in 1822. It became a popular venue for games, circuses and similar public events.
In 1823, he produced a proposed layout for the gardens on the Kemp Town estate, a high-class speculative residential development being built east of Brighton by Thomas Read Kemp. This scheme was not implemented, and Read Kemp decided to put iron railings round the open space instead. Five years later, though, Phillips' revised scheme was put in place. The Kemp Town Enclosures, as the gardens became known, covered and had paths around the edges surrounded by informally laid out flowers and small shrubs which were planted on small mounds to protect them from the windy weather on the exposed clifftop. Planting began early in 1828: the "Brighton Herald" of 8 February 1828 reported that "the plants possess great novelty and beauty of style ... 20,000 plants have been selected to embellish the grounds". The "Brighton Guardian" stated that "from the size and beauty of the trees, we should have taken it for a grove of seven years' standing, rather than ... a few weeks only". Phillips charged Read Kemp £371.10s.8d (£ as of ), which was paid when he went to the first meeting of the Kemp Town Enclosures Management Committee on 3 June 1828. The original layout (since altered) consisted of three linked sections, one of which featured a "rustic wooden summer-house" which was used until 1935 when it became too dilapidated to keep. The flowerbed which surrounded it was removed at the same time in favour of grass.
Another unexecuted scheme for Thomas Read Kemp was an extravagant plan to develop the empty downland between Read Kemp's house in the embryonic Montpelier suburb and the recently completed (1818) Bedford Square with large villas surrounding an informally planted public garden. The "Brighton Gazette" newspaper said of the proposal: "is like the cemetery of Père Lachaise or the city of Constantinople with its roofs and minarets encircled by trees".
In 1825, Phillips worked with Amon Henry Wilds again on an ambitious scheme to build a seafront square whose north side would be occupied by the Athenaeum—an exuberant Oriental-style glass and iron conservatory housing plants, a library and other public attractions, set in landscaped grounds. An engraving produced at the time the "outlandish" scheme was announced showed two Greek Revival-style sea-facing terraces with similar terraces leading back from the seafront to a large glazed building with several domes and minarets. It was to have been tall enough to have fully grown trees inside. Other sections of the complex would have housed a literary institute, a museum and a school specialising in scientific education. The residential buildings were started (and eventually completed by Wilds, under the names Oriental Terrace and Oriental Place), but in 1827 money ran out and the Athenaeum idea was abandoned. Sillwood Place, a northern continuation of Oriental Place and another Wilds project, occupies the intended site.
The Anthaeum.
"Unable to forget his dream" of a gigantic domed conservatory, Phillips revisited the idea in the 1830s. Launching his scheme under a slightly different name, the Anthaeum (meaning flower-house), he secured land and finance from Sir Isaac Goldsmid, 1st Baronet and engaged Amon Henry Wilds as architect. The site provided by Goldsmid was in Hove, then a small town west of Brighton which was beginning to develop as a fashionable residential area: the Anthaeum was built immediately north of Adelaide Crescent, on which work had started in 1830. The structure was a large dome with a diameter of and a height of (excluding the cupola in the centre), made of ribs of iron sunk into the soil and then glazed. Inside the dome, which enclosed an area of more than , Phillips planned an exotic garden with tropical trees and plants, unusual shrubs, a lake, birds and other features, "not unlike the modern Eden Project in Cornwall". Work started in late 1832, when deep foundations were dug, and the iron ribs were steadily erected over the next few months. Disagreements emerged between Wilds, Phillips, the project engineer Mr Hollis and the contractor Mr English, though, which led to the dismissal or resignation of Wilds and Hollis. English, whose decision not to build the intended central supporting pillar led to Hollis and Wilds abandoning the project, continued working with no proper supervision for several months, despite Phillips' concerns; and on 30 August 1833, the day before its official opening, the Anthaeum spectacularly collapsed: "the immense ribs of iron snapped asunder ... and a great part of structure, from the height it fell, was buried several feet deep in the earth". The shock made Phillips go blind, and the tangled wreckage was not cleared away for another 17 years. Palmeira Square now occupies the site.
Published works.
Phillips' books and other publications included:
"Pomarium Britannicum", subtitled "An historical and botanical account of fruits known in Great Britain", ran to three editions published between 1820 and 1827. "History of Cultivated Vegetables" and "Flora historica" both received a second edition. Described as "charming, erudite and readable volumes", his books were significant for being the first that concentrated on the history of horticulture and plants.
His ideas on the layout of plants and flowers in relation to their surroundings were influential. His published works included such statements as "bad taste is seldom more conspicuous than when we see plants marshalled in regular order" and "the beauty of plants cannot be displayed when they are too much crowded, as they are then drawn into unnatural shapes". When Brighton and Hove City Council restored the gardens and grounds of the Royal Pavilion to show how they would have appeared at the height of the Regency era, they did so according to Phillips' ideas—specifically his belief that "a well-planted shrubbery depends on the selection of trees and shrubs which succeed each other in blossoming throughout the year, as well as contrasting shades of green ... and under-planted flowers".

Temesgen Desalegn

Temesgen Desalegn is an Ethiopian journalist. As editor of the independent weekly newspaper "Feteh", Desalegn has gone to court several times as a result of his criticism of the national government, drawing protests on his behalf from international press freedom groups. 
Government lawsuits.
According to the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), between 2008 and July 2011, the Ethiopian government filed 41 lawsuits against Desalegn.
On 4 May 2012, Desalegn was found guilty of contempt of court after "Feteh" published the full text of a courtroom statement by independent journalist Eskinder Nega, who was on trial for terrorism charges. In the statement, Nega asserted his innocence and criticized the charges against him. Desalegn was given a suspended four-month prison term and a 2,000 birr (US$113) fine. CPJ protested the sentence, calling it an example of "growing severity of censorship in Ethiopia". 
State security charges.
In July 2012, "Feteh" was closed by government order, and 30,000 copies of the paper were seized. A prosecutor stated that the paper's coverage had been found to be "detrimental to the country’s national security".
On 10 August, Desalegn learned through a radio broadcast that he was being charged under three articles of Ethiopia's Criminal Code: Article 613, "defamation and calumny"; Article 486, "inciting the public through false rumours"; and Article 238, "outrages against the Constitution or the Constitutional Order", a capital offense. The charges were in response to articles published in August 2011, February 2012, and March 2012, in which "Feteh" had reported on youth protests against the government. The UK-based anti-censorship organization Article 19 issued a statement in support of Desalegn and called for the charges to be dropped. 
On 23 August, three days after the death of long-time prime minister Meles Zenawi, Desalegn was arrested on defamation charges as part of a general crackdown on government critics. After a court denied him bail, he was taken to Kaliti prison. According to Amnesty International, he was the first journalist to be arrested since Zenawi's death. The organization described the arrest as "a worrying signal that the government intends to carry on targeting dissent", stating that Desalegn appeared to have been arrested "for exercising his right to freedom of expression in advocating for peaceful protests to take place, among other criticisms of the government". CPJ also called for Desalegn's release, stating, "Temesghen is not a criminal for expressing his constitutional right to freedom of expression."
The government dropped the charges against him without comment on 29 August, and he was released from prison. The charges against Temesgen's publisher were also dropped, but Temsegen stated it was uncertain when "Feteh" would be able to restart publishing.
Post-Zenawi publishing.
In October 2012, "Feteh" and opposition party newspaper "Finote Netsanet" reported that the state-owned printer had refused to continue printing their papers, and that independent printers had canceled their contracts. Temesgen stated that one printer had stated it had been ordered by the Ministry of Justice to no longer print "Feteh". The newspaper was unable to print copies for several weeks.

Elena Igorevna Radionova (; born 6 January 1999) is a Russian figure skater. She is a two-time medalist on the Grand Prix series, the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy champion, and a two-time Russian national medalist. She has also won two World Junior titles (2013 & 2014) – the first ladies' single skater to do so – and the 2012 JGP Final. She is a junior-level ladies' record holder for the highest combined total, short program, and free skate scores.
Personal life.
Elena Igorevna Radionova was born 6 January 1999 in Moscow. She is the only child in her family.
Career.
Early years.
Radionova's father introduced her to skating when she was three years and nine months, seeking to align her club foot. Since the age of four, she is coached by Inna Goncharenko at CSKA Moscow.
In the 2010–2011 season, Radionova finished 4th at the 2011 Russian Junior Championships. She won the Zhuk Memorial kids' competition.
In the 2011–2012 season, Radionova appeared at her first senior Russian Championships, finishing 5th, and then won the bronze medal at the Russian Junior Championships. Not yet age-eligible for even junior ISU events, Radionova competed in the novice event at the 2012 Triglav Trophy, winning the gold medal.
2012–2013 season.
In the 2012–13 season, Radionova made her ISU Junior Grand Prix debut and won her events in France and Austria. She qualified for the JGP Final in Sochi, where she won another gold medal, finishing more than eleven points ahead of silver medalist Hannah Miller.
At the 2013 Russian Championships, Radionova won the senior-level silver medal ahead of defending champion Adelina Sotnikova and then took the junior title. Radionova placed fifth in the short program and first in the free skate at the 2013 World Junior Championships in Milan, Italy. She was awarded the gold medal while defending champion Yulia Lipnitskaya took silver and Anna Pogorilaya the bronze — resulting in a Russian sweep of the podium. Radionova then won the gold medal in the junior event at the 2013 Triglav Trophy.
2013–2014 season.
In an interview before the 2013–14 season, Radionova said: "I don't think that I am such a great athlete that won a lot. I just won the smallest one, Junior Worlds. In reality, there are competitions that are much more serious and more difficult. I don't feel any pressure yet. I just think I have to work harder and more, because there is no limit to perfection."
Radionova made her senior international debut at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy. Placing first in both programs, she won the gold medal by a margin of more than 25 points over two-time world champion Miki Ando. The 2013 Skate America was Radionova's first senior Grand Prix event. She was awarded the bronze medal at Skate America and then silver at the 2013 NHK Trophy, while gold at both events went to Japan's Mao Asada, whose skating Radionova admires. Radionova's results qualified her to her first Grand Prix Final. At the event in Fukuoka, Japan, she finished fourth overall behind Ashley Wagner.
Radionova won the bronze medal at the 2014 Russian Championships after placing third in both the short and long program. Though an injury caused her to miss the Russian junior nationals, she was later added to the Russian team for the 2014 World Junior Championships. At the event in Sofia, Bulgaria, Radionova became the first ladies' single skater to repeat as World Junior champion. Scoring 66.90 points in the short program, 127.39 in the free skate, and 194.29 for the combined total, she broke junior-level ladies' records previously held by Mirai Nagasu and Yulia Lipnitskaya. Radionova, Serafima Sakhanovich, and Evgenia Medvedeva produced Russia's second consecutive sweep of the World Junior ladies' podium. During the off-season, Radionova performed in various Russian cities with "Show of the Champions" and in Korea with Igor Bobrin's "Theatre on Ice".

World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace

The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace () was an international conference held on 25 to 28 August 1948 at Wrocław University of Technology. It was a propaganda conference organized by the Polish and Soviet communists aimed at the "American imperialism".
Organization.
The Congress was officially proposed by Polish communist activist, Jerzy Borejsza, but in reality it was most likely conceptualized and approved by the Soviet Union. It was held on 25 to 28 August 1948 at Wrocław University of Technology. It cost the organizers about 100 million Polish zloties.
Delegates.
A large number of notable individuals, primarily supportive of the left-wing policies, participated in the conference. They included: Pablo Picasso, Louis Aragon, Frédéric Joliot, Irène Joliot-Curie, Julian Huxley, Bertolt Brecht, Jorge Amado, György Lukács, Fernand Léger, Roger Vailland, Salvatore Quasimodo, Paul Éluard, Olaf W. Stapledon, Leon Moussinac, Jorge Amado, Alan J.P. Taylor, John Haldane and Julien Benda. Some Soviet delegates included Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev, Ilya Ehrenburg, and Mikhail Sholokhov. Polish representatives were, among others: Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz (leader of the Polish delegation), Maria Dąbrowska, Zofia Nałkowska, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Józef Chałasiński, Andrzej Panufnik, Kazimierz Wyka, Stanisław Lorentz, Stanisław Ossowski, Władysław Broniewski, Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Julian Krzyżanowski, Antoni Słonimski, Hugo Steinhaus, Julian Tuwim and Jerzy Zawieyski. Borejsza was the Congress' secretary general.
Albert Einstein sent a letter which was read to the delegates – but only after it had been censored to remove the call for a world government that would safeguard the uses of nuclear energy. Overall, the Congress was attended by about 600 individuals from 46 countries.
Program.
The Congress was part of the Stalin-supported Poland movement aimed at slowing down the development of the nuclear weaponry by the West (at that time, USSR did not have nuclear weapons of its own, although it was engaged in a crash program to develop them). Polish historian Wojciech Tomasik noted that the Congress was one of the examples in which the Soviet propaganda hijacked the concept of "defending the peace", to justify its own policies. The Congress aim was to influence the world's public opinion, portraying the communist powers as supporters of peace, and the Western ones, as a threat to it. Dąbrowska in her memories stated that "the Congress was not aimed at preventing the war in general, but at preventing an American-Soviet war from talking place "now", at the moment in which the USSR is in the inferior position."
Some Polish activists and politicians initially saw the congress as a neutral conference that would boost Polish relations with the West. However, soon after a strongly anti-American opening speech by Soviet delegation leader, Fadeyev, a number of western delegates such as Huxley or Curie declared themselves offended. In the United States, a pro-American, anti-Soviet Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace was held in New York in March 1949.

Goiânia mayoral election, 2012

The Goiânia mayoral election of 2012 was held on 7 October as part of the municipal elections in Brazil. Then incumbent mayor, Paulo Garcia, elected as the running mate of Iris Rezende in the previous election, ran against seven other candidates and was re-elected with more than 57% of the valid votes. On the same date, voters also chose their 35 representatives for the Municipal Chamber ("Câmara Municipal"). The elected mayor, deputy-mayor and aldermen will serve from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2016, when their terms will officially expire.
Although he faced seven contestants, Garcia found no major problems in being re-elected in the first round. He took advantage from the outcome of the "Monte Carlo Operation", led by the Federal Police ("Polícia Federal – PF") on early 2012. Until then, the candidate backed by Governor Marconi Perillo, then-Senator Demóstenes Torres, was the favorite in the opinion polls. PF's investigations, however, revealed that Perillo was an accessary to mobster Carlinhos Cachoeira and that Torres lobbied on his behalf at the Senate. Allegations of corruption undermined the intention of Perillo's Brazilian Social Democracy Party ("Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira – PSDB") to launch Congressman Leonardo Vilela, also associated with Cachoeira, or to support Torres, which was later impeached for his affiliation with the offender. Therefore, Perillo decided to support Congressman Jovair Arantes, that was hampered by the unpopularity of the latter.
Electorate.
In the 2012 election, 850,777 people were eligible to vote in Goiânia, which corresponded to 64.5% of the city's population, according to estimates from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ("Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – IBGE"). The city is divided into ten precincts – organized similarly to the city's official subdivision –, 2,909 voting rooms and 359 polling places. In 2012, biometric voting machines – which identifies voters by their fingerprints – were introduced in Goiânia. From 11 April 2011 to 23 March 2012, voters were called upon by the Regional Electoral Court ("Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de Goiás – TRE") to register their fingerprints. By the end of the period, more than 80% of voters had made the registration. The deadline was later extended until 9 May 2012. The refusal to register resulted in the cancellation of the voter registration card and in a fine ranging from 3% to 10% of the minimum wage. Without the card, a regular Brazilian is unable to get a passport, to retire from the Social Security, to enroll in public schools or universities, to obtain a loan from state-run banks or to become a civil servant. According to TRE-GO, 123,000 voter cards were canceled in Goiânia due to the lack of fingerprint registration.
Context.
On 6 October 2008, then mayor and former Governor Iris Rezende, of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party ("Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro – PMDB") was re-elected with 74% of the valid votes. His approval rating was of 81% at the time and he became the first mayor of Goiânia to be re-elected. On 1 April 2010, Rezende resigned from the office in order to run for Governor at the 2010 elections. Deputy-mayor Paulo Garcia, of the Workers' Party ("Partido dos Trabalhadores – PT"), – a party opposed to "irismo" until they reconciled to form Rezende's electoral coalition in 2008 – took office. Rezende lost the gubernatorial race to former Governor and then-Senator Marconi Perillo, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party ("Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira – PSDB"), elected on the second round with 53% of the valid votes.
Shortly before the definition of candidates for mayor, on 29 February 2012, criminal offender Carlinhos Cachoeira, which profited between 1 and 3 million reais (around 0.5 to 1.5 million dollars) per month through the illegal jogo do bicho was arrested in Goiânia as a result of the "Monte Carlo Operation", led by the Federal Police ("Polícia Federal – PF"). Wiretaps revealed close ties between Cachoeira and then-Senator Demóstenes Torres, from the Democrats ("Democratas – DEM"). Torres lobbied in Cachoeira's behalf at the National Congress. In order to avoid an expulsion from his party, Torres asked to be disaffiliated from DEM. Before the outbreak of the scandal, he was the favorite candidate of the population of Goiânia for mayor, with 43.4% of the voting intention. Two weeks prior to the "Monte Carlo Operation", Torres announced that he would not run in order not to undermine the opposition to Dilma Rousseff's administration in the Congress. Torres later became the second member in the history of the Senate to be impeached, becoming ineligible until 2027. Another pre-candidate harmed by his relationship with Cachoeira was alderman Elias Vaz, from the far-left Socialism and Freedom Party ("Partido Socialismo e Liberdade – PSOL"), which had between 14% and 18% of the voting intention. In one of the wiretaps, he calls Cachoeira "my comrade". In late June, Vaz announced that he would not run for mayor in order to try to keep his seat at the Municipal Chamber.
In addition to local and federal lawmakers, wiretaps also revealed Cachoeira's influence in the state government of Goiás. The offender paid the expenses of Marconi Perillo's gubernatorial campaign and bought a house that belonged to the latter (the same place where he was arrested by the PF), arranging for the purchase money to be delivered at the Emerald Palace ("Palácio das Esmeraldas"), seat of the state government. There is also evidence that Eliane Pinheiro, former chief of staff to the governor, has delivered classified information to Cachoeira's group and that Edivaldo Cardoso de Paula, former president of the State Traffic Department of Goiás ("Departamento Estadual de Trânsito – Detran-GO"), was nominated to the position at Cachoeira's request. After the media disclosed the ties between Perillo and Cachoeira, the Governor faced several protests in the streets of Goiânia and reached high levels of unpopularity, facing a disapproval rating of 74.4% in Goiânia on late July. According to Serpes institute, 26% of voters would consider the scandal when choosing their mayoral candidate.
Federal deputy Jovair Arantes, of the Brazilian Labour Party ("Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro – PTB"), which was cited by members of Cachoeira's group in wiretaps, was chosen as the candidate of the "Marconists" and had the highest rejection rate throughout the campaign. When asked by the press about his relationship with Cachoeira, Arantes replied: "I asked for a donation for my campaign; if he has committed a crime, it's not of my business". Cornered by the accusations, "Marconists" reacted. They launched an investigative committee at the Legislative Assembly ("Assembleia Legislativa de Goiás – Alego") in order to investigate the relations between municipal politicians and the offender. It approved disclosing the banking, income tax and telephone data of mayor Garcia and former mayor Rezende, while it refused to summon both Perillo and Cachoeira. According to political analyst Vassil Oliveira, their strategy was to use the investigative committee to wear out Paulo and, thus, consolidate Arantes. Nevertheless, Garcia and Rezende filed a collective lawsuit against Alego; they claimed that it does not compete to the Assembly the investigation of contracts which are not funded by the state of Goiás. A week after the election, judge Luis Eduardo de Souza granted an injunction overturning Alego's intention of disclosing the personal data of both Garcia and Rezende.
Candidates.
The 2012 election was contested by eight candidates, tying with 2004 as the election with the largest number of candidates in the history of Goiânia. The candidates were: incumbent mayor Paulo Garcia of the centre-left coalition "Goiânia, Sustainable City"; federal deputy Jovair Arantes of the centre-right "Marconist" coalition; state deputy Isaura Lemos; state deputy and TV and radio presenter Elias Júnior; alderman Simeyzon Silveira; business manager José Netho; lawyer Rubens Donizzeti; and history teacher Reinaldo Pantaleão. All of them, with the exception of José Netho and Isaura Lemos, have higher education diploma.

Peter Allen (physician)

Dr. Peter Allen (December 13, 1921) is a Canadian surgeon who played a leading role in improving cardiac surgery techniques. Along with Dr. Philip Ashmore, Dr. W.G. (Bill) Trapp and Dr. Ross Robertson, he performed the first Open Heart Surgery in British Columbia on 29 October 1957 at Vancouver General Hospital, by closing an Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) in 9 year old John Evans, using Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB).
Background.
Allen grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1946, he obtained a MD from the University of Toronto. In 1953, he received a Fellowship in general surgery from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and, in 1964, a Fellowship in thoracic surgery from the same institution.
His post graduate training included one year of internal medicine at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands followed by 4 1/2 years at the University of Toronto in the general surgery program at the Hospital for Sick Children and the Toronto General Hospital.
Returning to Vancouver, between early 1954 to mid-1956, he developed a practice in general surgery. During that period he held a research position at the British Columbia Research Institute under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Evelyn. The project tested the feasibility of replacing a diseased abdominal aorta with a mesh supported vena cava autograft In mid 1956 he began a year of training in Cardiac surgery with C. Walton Lillehei, the originator of Open-heart surgery, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In early 1957, he participated in the operation where the world’s first artificial cardiac pacemaker was employed by Lillehei.
Career.
In mid 1957 Allen returned to Vancouver and formed a cardiac team with surgeon, Philip Ashmore, anaesthetist William Dodds and paediatrician Morris Young. On October 29, 1957, at the Vancouver General Hospital, the team successfully performed the first open heart operation in British Columbia.
In 1977 to 1980 Allen was invited to establish a cardiac surgical certre at the Kasturba General Hospital, Bhopal, India. The Indian surgeon, Dr. Raj Bisaryia, who had trained in Vancouver continued the program between Dr. Allen’s visits.
In 1987 and 1989 Allen was the visiting cardiac surgeon at the Ibn-al;Bitar Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. The Hospital was built and staffed by the Irish construction company, PARC. The doctors, nurses and technicians were Irish, the only Iraqis were the patients and interpreters. Many patients lived in remote areas with minimal access to medical care. Consequently, most of the cardiac valve replacements used bioprosthetic {porcine tissue ]that required no anticoagulant therapy post operative, compared to the mechanical artificial valve that did require anticoagulents.
1990 to 1999 Allen was a chairman of medical review panels of the British Columbia Worker’s Compensation Board; he chaired 275 Panels. From 1972 to 1988 he established the annual Peter Allen Surgical Essay Award, open to senior cardio-thoracic trainees in the United Kingdom.
In 1993, after 36 years of surgical practice, he retired as an Emeritus Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine. In 1995 he moved to Oakville, Ontario and joined the Medical Clinic of Dr. Sapra and Dr. Khanna as a consultant in peripheral vascular disease, until retirement in 2006.
Honours and Awards.
1956 - Annual research prize of the British Columbia Surgical Society for work on the diseased abdominal aorta.
1957 - McLaughlin Fellowship to study cardiac surgery under Dr. Lillehei in Minneapolis.
1964 - Nuffield Travelling Fellowship to further study cardiac surgery at the Brompton Hospital in London and the Sulley Chest Hospital in Cardiff, Wales.
1972 - Invitation to address the Society of Thoracic and Cardiac Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. 
1978 - Vancouver Medical Association annual Osler Address.
1980 - Invitation to join the Pete’s Club composed of United Kingdom and Western European cardiac surgrons. The meetings were unique in that only surgical failures and problem cases were discussed. He held the final meeting of the Pete’s Club at the Vancouver General Hospital in 1989.
2011 - Joined the Grants Committee of the Oakville Community Foundation, a philanthropic group .

SZD-42 Jantar 2

The SZD-42 Jantar 2 is a single seat Open Class competition glider, designed and produced in Poland in the 1970s. It features a span of over 20 m (66 ft) and elastic, camber changing flaps. It was placed second, third and seventh at the 1976 World Gliding Championships. Over one hundred were built and more than ninety remain registered.
Design and development.
The Jantar 2 is a development of the SZD-38 Jantar 1 with a span increased by 2.50 m (8 ft 2.5 in) and a cruciform, rather than T-, tail. The latter change was introduced to limit the inertial stress on the fin during ground loops. Both types were designed by Adam Kurbiel. Jantar means amber, the mineral, in Old Polish.
Apart from the greater span, the wing of the Jantar 2 differed only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner half-span has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward swept edge of the outboard part. The wing construction is similar to that of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. Its camber changing flaps are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the upper wing surface. Combined with a carefully sealed sliding joint in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5 m (8 ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.
The fuselage of the Jantar 2 has a central steel tube section, enclosed within a glass fibre epoxy shell which narrows aft of the wings. Its cockpit is long and roomy, with a two piece canopy, the rear section of which hinges upwards from behind. The tall, straight tapered and blunt tipped fin is an integral part of the fuselage structure; the straight edged rudder extends down to the keel and operates in a small cut-out in the elevators. The Jantar's straight tapered tailplane is mounted on the fin just above the upper fuselage line. Its main monowheel undercarriage is retractable, as is the tailwheel. 
The Jantar 2 made its first flight on 2 February 1976. It was followed in production by the Jantar 2B, which differs chiefly in the position of its wing, raised on the fuselage by 125 mm (4.9 in) from mid-wing to shoulder position and with its angle of incidence reduced by 1.5°, better to align the fuselage and airflow at the attitude assumed in high speed flight. It also has an increase in water ballast capacity. This variant first flew on 13 March 1978.
Operational history.
The two prototypes competed at the World Gliding Championships of 1976, held in Finland, with Julian Ziobro finishing in second place and Henryk Muszczynski third. Dick Johnson came seventh in a production aircraft.
80 SZD-42s remained on the civil registers of European countries west of Russia in mid-2010. There are ten on the US register and the Australian register contains four more.

Chematica

Chematica is a software/database that uses algorithms and a collective database of 250 years of organic chemical information to predict and provide synthesis pathways for molecules. The software development, lead by Bartosz A. Grzybowski, took place for a decade when it was finally publicized in August, 2012. Press have dubbed the software as the "Google of chemistry" and "chemical brain".
Features.
The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software has the potential to enhance a chemists quest for drug discovery and other industrially important chemicals. There are estimated seven million chemicals connected by the number of reactions and catalogues 86,000 chemical rules.
The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools that use back-tracking to assess each possible step. Back-tracking has been found to be inefficient as even a five-step synthesis amounts to 1019 possible pathways.
One can specify a molecule in several ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. One can scale node sizes by molecular weight, product occurrence, and reactant occurrence. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.
The program also notes regulated and unregulated compounds, and uses specialized algorithms that avoid these. It also gives the classification and reasons for regulation.
One-Pot Reactions.
The software has the potential to determine synthesis pathways that can take place through a "one-pot" reaction, where all starting chemicals are mixed simultaneously to achieve final product, thereby eliminating any purification and need for multiple steps.

Fish Meat

Fish Meat is a 2012 documentary by Fish Navy Films that analyzes and questions current fish farming practices. It was an official selection at the Blue Ocean Film Festival, Idyllwild Film Festival, San Francisco Ocean Film Festival, Catalina Film Festival and. It has also screened around the country, including at the University of Colorado and at University of Massachusetts Amherst. The documentary examines different methods used in modern aquaculture from Atlantic bluefin tuna ocean pens, to trout closed system farms, to old fashioned carp farms and concludes that the fish from lower in the food chain is better for sustainable aquaculture.
Synopsis.
Two friends, Ted Caplow (an ecological engineer) and Andy Danylchuk
They visit a high tech seabass farm, partly automated and equipped with video surveillance. While this is one of the more efficient ways of raising fish since the fish farmers can use the minimum amount of feed to fatten their fish, it is very expensive. It also causes a lot of waste and pollution with excess feed and fish waste falling below the cage.
Caplow and Danulchuk set out to define sustainable aquaculture in Turkey to see how it could apply to the rest of the world. They are surprised to find that the fish meal used to feed farmed fish is made of wild caught fish in South America. Between the food production and waste produced by offshore fish farms, Caplow and Danylchuck are concerned these methods are unsustainable.
The tuna ranch they visit next is by far the most modern operation they come across. Watching the harvesting process and learning about the amount of technology and fish feed required to produce a pound of Atlantic bluefin tuna, Caplow and Danylchuk conclude that it is also the least sustainable. It also removes fish from the open ocean that have not had a chance to spawn yet, which affects the wild populations.
Caplow decides that the ideal fish farm uses a minimal amount of energy, cause a minimal amount of pollution and involve growing fish that are as low on the food chain as possible.
Caplow and Danylchuk visit an inland seabass and seabream farm in the Muğla Province, that uses dug out pens supplied by a salt water spring. Not only did they find that this farm uses less energy but the fish looked and tasted better.
At a trout farm in the Taurus mountains, Caplow is impressed by the management of their freshwater streams, recycling the water several times through each stage of the fish growing process from egg to fish before allowing it to rejoin the stream. But the problem remains that the fish from their feed comes from far away, and the trout must themselves be transported long distances to reach consumers.
Next they visit a restaurant come fish farm in the Saklikent canyon, that raises their fish directly across the street from where they are later eaten by consumers. This provides the smallest waste of energy since virtually no fuel is needed to transport the fish.
Finally, they visit a carp farm in Burdur Province, an inland farm where the fish feed very low on the food chain. The feed conversion ratio is much lower than in the carnivorous fish they had seen. The fish waste was used to grow vegetables, and the waste water flowed downstream to nourish farms.
Caplow and Danylchuk discuss the differences between eating from the sea and eating from land. The range of types of fish production is very broad, whereas eating say a cow is very specialized and polluting. However, the variety of fish will inevitably diminish with time as more fish species become overfished. Aquaculture will be the only way to eat fish, and if it is done in a sustainable way it could be the answer to feeding a growing human population.
The film concludes that the least sustainable fish farming method they saw was also the newest, raising an endangered species, a disruptive fishing method, requiring a lot of fish to feed them. The most sustainable fish was also the oldest, raising an abundant species of fish feeding low on the food chain, using an ancient technique.
Versions.
A 29-minute version of the documentary was released at the beginning of 2012. A longer, Academic version was released in mid-2012 at 52 minutes.
Reception.
The documentary has been well-received by the scientific community as well as by sustainable aquaculture advocates such as celebrity chef Barton Seaver, CEO of CleanFish Tim Oshea, and filmmaker Ana Joanes (director of Fresh).
Céline Cousteau liked the movie, saying ""I appreciate how the message was shared: it's not about being against fish farming, it's about doing it right!"

Good Cities (Prince-Bishopric of Liège)

The Good Cities (French: "Bonnes Villes") were the most important cities of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège (980-1795). If considered a Good City, the city was allowed to build a city wall; partake in the States of Liège; and erect a perron symbolising the autonomy and freedom of Liège.
In 1651 the Good Cities numbered 23, and they were grouped in so-called "villes thioises" (Low Dietsch cities, which contemporarily would be termed Dutch or Flemish) and "villes françoises" (contemporarily French or Walloon cities). All of these Good Cities are located within present-day Belgium.
Two other major cities of the Prince-Bishopric had a "special statute", which differentiated them from the Good Cities as they were not allowed to be represented at the States of Liège.

The Condominium of Maastricht - of which the Prince-Bishopric shared the authority with the Duchy of Brabant and later the Dutch Republic - as well as the Dukedom of Bouillon comprised the two cities with special statute.
