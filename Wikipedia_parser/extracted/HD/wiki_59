Boca Raton Public Library

The Boca Raton Public Library consist of two library facilities serving the residents of the incorporated area of Boca Raton, Florida. The City of Boca Raton, incorporated in 1925, is one of the largest and the southern most city in Palm Beach County, Florida. Boca Raton's libraries complement the Palm Beach County Library System, as city residents and individuals owning property within the city limits are entitled to a free library card.
History.
The Woman’s Club of Boca Raton started the community library in January, 1923. The library was managed by a group of volunteers and the collection was developed from donations. It closed in 1926 and the collection was donated to a local elementary school.
In January, 1946, the community library reopened and its collection was housed in a building located on the Boca Raton Army Air Field. Severe damage from a hurricane forced the library to close again in 1947.
Another community library opened inside the city's town hall in 1948. With the help of funding from the city, the library moved to the administration building of the Garden Apartments on West Palmetto Road in 1957. A new library building was completed in 1961 on NW 2nd Avenue, the location of the current Downtown Library. In 1966 this building was dedicated to the city and named the Boca Raton Public Library. The building subsequently underwent several renovations.
In 2003 Boca Raton voters approved a $19.8 million bond issue for the building of two new library buildings. The first building, located at 1501 Spanish River Boulevard, opened on January 26, 2008 and is known as the Spanish River Library and Community Center. The second building was constructed on Boca Raton Boulevard, a block north of the original Boca Raton Downtown Library, and opened in June 2013.
Facilities.
The Boca Raton Library has two locations to serve the residents of incorporated Boca Raton. The Downtown Library (21,400 square feet) is located at 200 N.W. Boca Raton Boulevard. The Spanish River Library and Community Center (40,940 square feet) is located at 1501 N.W. Spanish River Boulevard. The Spanish River Library, built in the Addison Mizner (1872-1933) style, additionally provides public space for meetings, gatherings, and events. The hours of the library are posted on the library web site.
Groundbreaking for a new 41,932 square foot Boca Raton Downtown Library took place on April 24, 2012. The new library is designed by PGAL of Boca Raton in the Mediterranean architectural style of Addison Mizner (1872-1933). The library is being built to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification requirements.
The new Boca Raton Downtown Library was officially opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony and celebration on June 22, 2013. The 42,000 square foot building features 70 public access computers, study rooms, and events space.

Andy Williams discography

Andy Williams recorded 42 studio albums, 17 of which (along with the 1970 compilation "Andy Williams' Greatest Hits") received Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 500,000 units. Three of those recipients went on to reach one million in sales, for which they were awarded Platinum certification. Between studio, Christmas, and compilation albums he had 35 entries on the pop albums chart in "Billboard" magazine with 12 of those making the top 10. One of those 12, his 1963 album "Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests", spent 16 weeks at number one and comes in at number five on the list of the top albums released in the 1960s in terms of "Billboard" chart performance. During the 1960s and early 1970s two of his Platinum LPs, "The Andy Williams Christmas Album" and "Merry Christmas", made annual appearances on the magazine's Christmas Albums chart, where they each reached the number one position in multiple holiday seasons. In a ranking of the top album artists of the 1960s in terms of "Billboard" chart performance, he comes in at number eight.
Williams also recorded 45 songs that reached "Billboard" magazine's Hot 100 chart in the United States and another eight that "bubbled under" the Hot 100. Eight of these 53 recordings made the top 10 (including 1957's "Butterfly", which spent three weeks at number one), and 32 of them are also on the list of 44 entries that Williams had on the magazine's Easy Listening chart, which was started in 1961. 19 of those 44 songs made the top 10 on that list, and four of them ("Can't Get Used to Losing You", "In the Arms of Love", "Happy Heart", and "(Where Do I Begin) Love Story") went on to number one. In a ranking of "Billboard"'s top Adult Contemporary chart performers from 1961 to 1969, he comes in at number five.
In 1963 the Williams recording of "White Christmas" was released to promote "The Andy Williams Christmas Album" and spent the last five weeks of the year at number one on "Billboard"'s Christmas Singles chart. The album also included "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year", which was written for "The Andy Williams Show" and became a staple of his annual Christmas specials. Although covers of the song he originated by artists such as Garth Brooks and Harry Connick, Jr. had single chart runs in "Billboard" upon initial release, the recording by Williams enjoyed widespread popularity several decades after it debuted. The list of the "Top 10 Holiday Songs (Since 2001)" that was published by "Billboard" in 2009 ranked the Williams recording at number five, and on the 2010 countdown of holiday songs receiving the most radio airplay as determined by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (also known as ASCAP) the Williams classic came in at number four.
Since the British Phonographic Industry began its awards in 1973 Williams had six albums receive Silver certification for selling 60,000 units in the UK, and two of those albums eventually sold the 100,000 units necessary for receiving Gold certification. On the UK album chart he had 30 entries with 11 of those making the top 10. He also had 23 recordings that reached the UK singles chart with nine of those reaching the top 10, including "Butterfly", which spent two weeks at number one.
Label X and the Cadence years.
Williams's first recordings as a solo artist were done in two sessions for the RCA subsidiary Label X in the mid-1950s. Two songs were recorded at the first session, "Groundhog" and "There Is a Time", but according to Williams, "Nothing came of this date... The numbers are still on the shelf." The four songs from the other session produced two singles: "Why Should I Cry Over You?"/"You Can't Buy Happiness" and "Now I Know"/"Here Comes That Dream Again". In 1967 Williams described something he learned in moving from RCA to Cadence Records in 1955: "I realized that what I had done for Label X wasn't the right kind of product -- in fact, the proof of this is that even years later, when I was selling big on Columbia, those sides were never reissued on RCA."
When Williams arrived at Cadence on December 1, 1955, label founder Archie Bleyer immediately had him record two holiday songs, "The Wind, the Sand and the Star" and "Christmas Is a Feeling in Your Heart". But Williams explains in his autobiography that his new boss "didn't get the record released until a few days before Christmas" and that "it sold only 10,000 copies." His next single, however, included his first song to reach the "Billboard" Hot 100, "Walk Hand in Hand", and it became the first of half a dozen hits to be packaged together with their corresponding B-sides on his first compilation album, which was simply entitled "Andy Williams".
For his first studio album Williams decided to pay tribute to the songwriting talent of his "Tonight Show" colleague Steve Allen because, he explains, "I thought that if I recorded an album of Steve's own compositions, he might let me sing one or two on the show." Allen, in fact, had Williams eventually perform the entire album on the show by having him sing a different song each night. Williams turned to the popular duo of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II for his second Cadence LP, which included songs from their Broadway musicals "Carousel", "The King and I", "Oklahoma!", and "South Pacific". Indeed each of the long players he made for the label had its own specific focus, such as songs from Hawaii or France, and it was during this phase that he recorded "Lonely Street", his first release to reach the pop albums chart in "Billboard" magazine.
The singles that Williams recorded for Cadence charted much more frequently. Of his 16 A-sides that made the "Billboard" Hot 100 and its predecessors during this period, 11 of them made it into the top forty positions on the chart, and six of those reached the top ten. Some of these hits fit in nicely with the ballads or what is now called the traditional pop format of many of his LPs at the time. In fact three of the more successful songs from this era ("The Hawaiian Wedding Song", "Lonely Street", and "The Village of St. Bernadette") inspired the themes of the albums on which they later appeared. But several singles, including "Butterfly", "I Like Your Kind of Love", and "Lips of Wine", followed the burgeoning rock and roll trend. "Archie wasn't trying to turn me into a poor man's Elvis; he was just trying to find hit songs. If they were rock and roll, then he wanted them sung that way."
The Columbia years.
Williams's move to Columbia Records in 1961 heralded the start of a highly successful series of albums produced by Robert Mersey that focused on standards, including many from stage and screen, with some Easy Listening hits of the day eventually becoming part of the formula. One of these projects, 1962's "Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes", became his first album to reach the top 10 on "Billboard"'s Top LP's chart and his earliest recording to receive Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. His chart-topping "Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests" (which included his number two pop hit "Can't Get Used to Losing You") also reached the half million mark in sales, as did the next five consecutive top 10 albums and two number one Christmas LPs on which Mersey also did much of the arranging and conducting. His top 10 release from 1966, "The Shadow of your Smile", featured covers of the Beatles songs "Michelle" and "Yesterday" and foreshadowed the shift that Williams would be making over the next few years toward contemporary material. His next LP, "In the Arms of Love", peaked only as high as number 21, making it his lowest charting studio album with Columbia to date and helping to explain why it didn't sell enough to receive Gold certification. After 12 projects with Mersey at the helm, Williams moved on to work with producers that could accommodate his more modern aspirations.
He began his next string of Gold records in 1967 with "Born Free", which relied exclusively on recent hits from the pop and Easy Listening charts and became the first of five more top 10 albums he would release. When Clive Davis became President of Columbia Records that same year, he paid close attention to the label's Easy Listening artists since most of them were experiencing a decline in sales. "Only Williams was really keeping current. He was open to the new, younger writers that were emerging." One of the musical directors of "The Andy Williams Show", Jack Elliott, had made note of the singer's musical taste in 1967 as well: "Andy constantly wants to do new material. If anything, the only professional criticism I would have is that I think he reaches too hard for today's stuff." But in retrospect Davis takes on part of the responsibility for trying to appeal to young record buyers. "I urged Andy to include only the most well-known of contemporary songs in his albums. I had carefully studied the sales of his albums, and it was a matter of mathematics: sales increased in proportion to the number of identifiable titles on the album cover. It became almost a formula."
The formula also worked well in England, where his next LP, "Love, Andy", reached number one, and even as Williams was not charting and selling in the US in the 1970s as he had been, the numbers across the Atlantic remained impressive. The 1970 "Andy Williams' Greatest Hits" compilation reached number 42 during its 20 weeks on "Billboards list of the 200 Top LP's in America, but in the UK the album spent its first three weeks on their much smaller album chart at number two before eventually spending five of its 116 weeks there at number one. His final top 10 LP in America, 1971's "Love Story", went under the title "Home Lovin' Man" in the UK, where it reached number one, and four more top 10 albums followed it onto the UK chart, including 1974's "The Way We Were", which was the first of his 25 studio albums released by Columbia thus far that did not reach the "Billboard" charts. His popularity in England wasn't enough to sustain his relationship with Columbia much longer, and he recorded a few more albums that didn't receive wide attention before moving on.
The post-Columbia years.
In 1984, British record producers Tony Hiller and Nicky Graham enticed Williams back into the studio after a four-year hiatus to record "Greatest Love Classics", a project in which the duo had written lyrics for selections of classical music. His next three albums revisited concepts with which he'd had varying degrees of success: movie songs on "Close Enough for Love", Christmas music on "I Still Believe in Santa Claus", and Country music on "Nashville". In 1994 he released audio and video recordings of two concerts that were filmed at his Moon River Theater in Branson, Missouri. The CD "Greatest Hits" and corresponding video "Andy Williams in Concert at Branson" featured live performances of "Moon River", "Can't Get Used to Losing You", "Canadian Sunset", and many others, and "The New Andy Williams Christmas Album" and its video companion, "The Andy Williams Christmas Show", offered many favorites from his holiday albums, including "White Christmas", on which he is joined by Lorrie Morgan and The Osmond Brothers. The following year he released an album of new holiday recordings entitled "We Need a Little Christmas", but his next return to the studio wasn't until 2006, when he recorded "I Don't Remember Ever Growing Up", which was released in the UK the following year.
Albums.
Album reissues.
Many of the albums that Williams recorded were originally available in the vinyl LP, 8-track tape, Reel-to-reel, and audio cassette formats but were later reissued on compact disc. With close to 80 minutes of space available on each disc, it was possible to combine two albums on one CD, and most Williams albums have been paired up and reissued in this format, as shown in the collapsed table below:
Compilation albums.
Several Williams compilations are noteworthy for either their chart success, as noted by 13 of them listed below, or the material included. For example, Williams himself selected the songs included on "Moon River: The Very Best of Andy Williams".
Live albums.
Two Williams concerts in 1993 became his first domestic releases of live material:

González Byass

González Byass is one of Spain's most well-known sherry bodega. Its origins can be traced to 1835 when the business was started by Manuel María González Angel, who was subsequently joined by his English agent, Robert Blake Byass. The business was further expanded by the second generation of the González family, amongst them Manuel Críspulo González y Soto. The González family assumed sole control of the business in 1988. The firm produces the fino sherry Tío Pepe.
Not only was the Gonzalez family at the forefront of sherry winemaking, they’ve also participated in the introduction of the polo game in Spain, the first grass tennis court, the installation of the first electric lighting and running water in the plant, the first train project in Spain as well as numerous other industrial and cultural innovations. In 1862, when Queen Isabel II visited the firm, the construction of a new bodega called La Concha was commissioned from the engineer Gustav Eiffel.
In 1963 they constructed the great Tío Pepe bodega, holding 28,000 butts and built on 3 floors. Another bodega was built in 1972, Las Copas, with a capacity of around 80,000 butts. In 1998 the Byass family withdrew from the company. The company is now owned and run by the 4th and 5th generation of the Gonzalez family, such as Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez. In 2004, Gonzalez Byass joined forces with Grupo Vips and opened 8 Tio Pepe restaurants in Madrid, but they were closed in 2011 due to the crisis. In 2008 the company acquired the well-known Viñas del Vero wineries.
The famous sombrero-wearing, guitar-toting bottle became the classic image of the Tio Pepe brand in 1935. The famous neon sign in Puerta del Sol in Madrid caused a bit of a stir when Apple bought the building and decided that the sign should be removed from the roof (probably to replace it with the Apple logo). The bodega has found another rooftop in the same Puerta del Sol once again and the sign should be reinstalled after renovations.
Awards.
In 2010, Gonzalez Byass was awarded as Winemaker of the year in the International Wine and Spirit Competition.

Operation Sea Lion (wargame)

Operation Sea Lion was a major wargame conducted at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1974. Its aim was find out what might have happened had Nazi Germany launched Operation Sea Lion, their planned invasion of southeast England during World War II, on 22 September 1940. The wargame was organized by the "Daily Telegraph" and Dr Paddy Griffith from the Department of War Studies at Sandhurst. The German umpires were General Adolf Galland (air), Admiral Friedrich Ruge (naval) and General Heinrich Trettner (land). Their respective British counterparts were Air Chief Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris, Rear Admiral Teddy Gueritz and Major General Glyn Gilbert. After the game's conclusion, the umpires unanimously concluded that the invasion was a devastating defeat for the German invasion force.
Scenario.
The game was played using a scale model of southeast England, the English Channel, and northern France. Available troops and resources were based on known plans from both sides, and weather conditions were based on contemporary British Admiralty records that had, until then, never been published. The scenario assumed that the German military had taken until September to assemble the shipping necessary for a Channel crossing, and that the Luftwaffe had not yet established air supremacy. The Luftwaffe also had to continue to bomb London. As happened historically, in the main the Germans had only river barges available as transport ships.
Invasion.
The German attack was launched at dawn on 22 September 1940 and consisted of 8,000 airborne troops and 80,000 infantry landed in amphibious operations. The attack went reasonably well for the first 24 hours, although the Germans lost about 25% of their (unseaworthy) barges which were being used to ferry the forces across the channel. During this 24 hour period the Royal Air Force lost 237 aircraft (about 23% of its fighting strength), the Luftwaffe losses amounted to 333, also about 23% of its aircraft. Naval engagements were indecisive at this stage as the Royal Navy was still assembling its main destroyer fleet to attack. The larger ships of the Home Fleet (including battleships, heavy cruisers and aircraft carriers) were not to be committed due to the risk of air attack.
Over the next two days the Germans managed to advance a dozen or so miles inland and even captured the port of Folkestone but the docks had been thoroughly demolished by the British and so it was more or less unusable. However, once the British and Commonwealth forces were moved to fully engage in the battle the Germans' advance halted. At this stage the Germans had few tanks and only light artillery, furthermore an increasing shortage of ammunition was slowly forcing them back towards the sea. The Germans asked "Hitler" if the bombing of London could stop and the planes used to attack British ships instead but the request was denied. At dawn on 24 September the second German landing, which was to include tanks and heavy artillery as well as supplies and men, was intercepted by the Royal Navy's destroyers—65% of the barges were sunk. After this the final German surrender was inevitable.
Conclusion.
The German navy`s relative weakness, combined with the Luftwaffe's lack of air supremacy, meant it was not able to prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the planned Channel crossings. The Navy's destruction of the second invasion wave prevented resupply and reinforcement of the landed troops, as well the arrival of more artillery and tanks. This made the position of the initially successful invasion force untenable; it suffered further casualties during the attempted evacuation. Of the 90,000 German troops who landed only 15,400 returned to France. 33,000 were taken prisoner, 26,000 were killed in the fighting and 15,000 drowned in the English Channel. All six umpires deemed the invasion a resounding failure.

Sanmenhai

Sanmenhai is a cave in the Leye-Fengshan geopark in Guangxi, China. The cave is unique in that it features seven skylights that mimic the layout of the constellation Ursa Major (the Big Dipper).
Etymology.
"Sanmenhai" translates into English as "three doors accessible to the sea". The cave is also known as "Shuiyuandong", meaning "cave that produces water".
Location and geology.
Sanmenhai is located in Poxin, a village in Fengshan County, Guangxi. It is an outlet of the Poxin underground river, which formed during the Permian period.
Exploration.
The seven skylights of the cave are designated Skylight I - Skylight VII. Skylights I - IV extend westward from the entrance of the cave. Sanmenhai is delimited by Skylight III, which divides the underground river into southeast and northwest sections. The southeast portion is accessible by tourists, and extends from the outlet to Skylight III.
Only three of the seven skylights are accessible by boat on the underground river: Skylights I, II, and III. Skylights IV and V are accessible by diving through the river a distance of and , respectively.
The Poxin underground river undergoes daily tidal fluctuations, rising by at night.
Sanmenhai is a typical karst landform. In an area of less than , in encompasses peaks, sinkholes, natural bridges, and karst lakes.
skylight in sanmenhai is also called karst window(tiankeng) by Chinese, it is sinkhole-like formation, but differ from sinkhole
Skylight I.
Skylight I is the biggest among the seven skylights. It is roughly circular in shape, with walls that are covered in vegetation. The diameter of the opening is in the east/west direction and in the north/south direction, with a depth of . There are four routes to Skylight I: the upper and lower reaches of the Poxin River; Gandong cave in east and south; and a water cave from underground. In 2009, a diving exploration found that there is no cave channel in underground.
Skylight II.
Skylight II is an oval measuring . The bottom of the skylight is half-covered by water, at a depth of below the rim. Some plants grow horizontally on the wall of Skylight II.
Skylight III.
Skylight III is 690 m from the outlet. It is funnel-shaped, with a top diameter of , and a diameter at the water level of . The water depth is as much as with an extra of sediment. In 2008, explorers found that there was an underwater cave connecting Skylight III with Skylight IV.
Skylight IV.
Skylight IV is also funnel-shaped, with top dimensions of and water as deep as . The total height of this skylight (including the depth of the water) is .

Tjaskers in Germany

A Fluttermühle () is a type of small drainage windmill used in the Netherlands and Germany. There are six fluttermühle remaining in Germany, all in Lower Saxony.
Locations.
Bedekaspel.
<br>
The boktjasker of Bedekaspel is located near the drainage smock mill Agnes. The system of ditches do not form a complete circle so the mill can only operate with southerly to westerly winds. In 2011 the mill was in a state of disrepair.
Grotegaste/Lütjegaste.
<br>
The paaltjasker is located west of Ihrhove near the hamlet Grotegaste and was built in 2000 by millwright Richard Kluin from Ihrhove, 
together with the fluttermühle of Weenermoor (see below). 
The mill has four Common sails and is fully functional.
Moorsee.
<br>
The paaltjasker is located next to the Moorseer Mühle and is part of its museum. 
The mill has four Common sails. 
Riepe.
<br>
The boktjasker was built in 1986 as a replica
of this type of mill that was once common in the region. 
The tjasker has four symmetrical Common sails that can be covered with wooden slats. The photo in the database of the "Deutsche Gesellschaft für Mühlenkunde und Mühlenerhaltung (DGM)" shows it having a complete circular ditch system for winding,
however recently dated photos show it in a static position taking water directly from a lake. 
Weenermoor.
<br>
The paaltjasker is located between Weenermoor and Sankt Georgiwold and was built by millwright Richard Kluin from Ihrhove in 2000. The mill was constructed as a nature compensation measure for the construction of the Weenermoor wind farm and is used to raise the water table in a nature reserve. The mill has four Common sails which have a span of . Winding the mill to face the wind is not possible. The frame has been stiffened by cables to prevent sagging.

St Mary's Church, Kirkby Lonsdale

St Mary's Church, Kirkby Lonsdale, is located in the town of Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of six local churches to form the Kirkby Lonsdale Team Ministry. The church contains Norman architecture and is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.
History.
The oldest parts of the church are Norman. Three doorways and the inner north arcades date from the early 12th century, and the base of the tower and the south arcade are from the later part of that century. In the 14th century (or possibly about 1400) the north and south walls of the church were demolished and were rebuilt further outwards, the new south wall incorporating the earlier south doorway. A chantry chapel was added to the northeast of the church in 1486. In the 16th century a new clerestory, pinnacles, and battlements were added, and in 1574 an additional aisle was built further north of the existing north aisle. The top of the tower was rebuilt in 1705, and the chantry chapel was demolished at that time. In 1807 the clerestory, battlements and pinnacles were removed by Francis Webster, who added an overall roof. The church was restored in 1866 by E. G. Paley. He raised the roof, giving the outer north aisle a separate roof, reseated the church, re-floored the chancel, added a south porch, and installed a screen and a font.
Architecture.
Exterior.
St Mary's is constructed in stone with slate roofs. It is a wide church with a rectangular plan, apart from the south porch. It has a nave and a chancel, one south and two north aisles, a south porch, and a west tower embraced by the aisles. The tower is in four stages; the parapets of the tower and the body of the church are embattled. There are three Norman doorways, one at the base of the tower, the other two on the south side of the church. The 19th–century south porch is in Neo-Norman style. The windows along the side of the church are square-headed, and contain differing numbers of lights. The east window consists of three lancets with a vesica above. The top stages of the tower are Perpendicular.
Interior.
The west part of the arcade between the nave and the inner north aisle is early Norman with round arches; some of its piers have incised decoration similar to that on the piers in Durham Cathedral. The south arcade is later and simpler. To the east ends of the arcades, the arches are pointed. The easternmost pier of the south arcade contains a piscina. The outer north arcade is in Perpendicular style. The pulpit is dated 1619, but has been reduced in size since. The font has been moved from a 14th-century chapel at Killington, and is set on a 19th-century base. The reredos is in alabaster with mosaic decoration. Most of the stained glass is by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, but there are also windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne (designed by Henry Holiday), by Shrigley and Hunt, and by William Wailes. The oldest monument is a tomb chest with an alabaster effigy dating from the 15th century. The two-manual pipe organ was built in the 1860s by Forster and Andrews, and rebuilt and enlarged in 1925 by Jardine and Company. It was extensively rebuilt in 1972 by Laycock and Bannister. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1825 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.
External features.
In the churchyard are ten monuments that have been listed at Grade II. To the east of the church is a monument to the Burrow family, dating from the middle of the 18th century. To the south of this is a table tomb from the early 18th century. Also to the east of the church is a monument to John Dent dated 1709, and a table tomb to Rowland Tarham dated 1716. To the south of the church is a monument to two members of the Preston family, the table tomb dated 1775 of Thomas Newby, and a table tomb to members of the Turner family dated in the 1790s. To the west of the church is the table tomb of Thomas Tiffin dated 1787, and a table tomb dated 1818 to Edward Theobalds. Also to the west of the church is a memorial to five women who died in a fire in the Rose and Crown Inn in 1820. To the north of the church is a gazebo, which was formerly in the garden of the vicarage. It is a two-storey octagonal stone structure with round-headed doors and windows, but has lost its former roof.

Emilio Lustau

Emilio Lustau is a Spanish sherry producer. The firm is known for its "Almacenista" range of sherries, the products of small family-owned bodegas that it sells as specialist bottlings under its brand name. 
The history of Bodegas Lustau dates back to 1896, when it was founded by Don José Ruiz-Berdejo. He grew some vines in his own finca called Finca Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza, aged the wines for some time and then sold them to bigger houses that commercialized and exported the wines. This is what we call an almacenista, a warehouser or stockkeeper.
After his death in 1930, the bodega was moved to the old town centre of Jerez and slowly expanded. By then, the founder’s son in law Don Emilio Lustau Ortega from Granada was at the head of the company. Emilio began to export wines in the 1950s and felt Lustau should be at the forefront of quality, while staying loyal to his almacenista roots. He introduced the Lustau Solera Reserva range, composed with old stocks acquired from different almacenistas, and later (in 1981) added the Almacenista range, a series of hand-picked wines from small almacenistas, bottled and labeled by Lustau but with the provenance mentioned on the label. Both are still highly respected ranges and among the more widely available premium sherries.
The Lustau company was sold in 1990 to Luis Caballero, a company famous for its Ponche Caballero liqueur, the most popular of its kind in Spain. The sale gave Bodegas Lustau a solid financial backbone and oxygen for further expansion. One of the latest achievements was the purchase of six bodega buildings that belonged to Domecq, when this house was split and sold to different buyers. In 2001 and 2002, these 20.000 square metre buildings were restored and now house all of the Lustau wines. Since 2008, the company also owns some of the great Domecq brands as well as their related soleras: La Ina, Botaina, Rio Viejo Macarena and Viña 25 – 4,000 butts in all.

Michael Wacha

Michael Joseph Wacha (born July 1, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball for the Texas A&M Aggies.
The Cardinals selected Wacha in the first round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft from Texas A&M. With just one year in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut on May 30, 2013. Following a strong regular season, Wacha earned the 2013 National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award, after yielding one run and eight hits in his first 21 postseason innings pitched.
Early life.
Michael Wacha was born in Iowa City, Iowa, to Tom and Karen Wacha as the second of four children. He has one older brother, Charlie, one younger brother, Lucas, and a younger sister, Brette. When Wacha was three years old, his family moved from Iowa City to Texarkana, Texas. His future college coach, Rob Childress, first spotted Wacha pitching in an American Legion game; Wacha's father was the coach and his sister the batgirl. Wacha's uncle, Dusty Rogers, pitched in the Cincinnati Reds organization from 1984 through 1988.
Amateur career.
Wacha attended Pleasant Grove High School in Texarkana, Texas, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. As a basketball player, he lettered three years as a forward and was honored on the first-team all-district on his way to advancing his school to the regional finals during his senior year. In his junior baseball season, Wacha posted a 16–3 W–L record, pitching the Hawks to the state finals. As a senior, he led the Hawks to the state semi-finals in his senior year in 2009 with a 6–3 won-lost record (W–L record). Wacha was a two-time all-state selection; he was selected to the all-state first-team and all-state tournament team. Excelling academically, Wacha was a member of the National Honor Society; in basketball, Wacha earned first-team academic all-state honors.
As an enrollee at Texas A&M University, Wacha played three years of college baseball for the Texas A&M Aggies. At this point, Wacha stood 6' 5" () tall, weighed and threw his fastball with a velocity between and . During his freshman campaign, he made ten starts in 25 total appearances and posted a 2.90 earned run average (ERA) and a 9–2 W–L record. Wacha also registered 97 strikeouts (SO) and 22 walks (BB) in innings pitched (IP). His nine wins ranked fifth and 2.90 ERA sixth in the Big 12 Conference. For his performance, "Louisville Slugger" named Wacha a freshman All-American. 
In his sophomore year, Wacha posted a 9-4 record in 16 starts with 123 SO and just 20 BB and a 2.29 ERA in IP. That performance earned him a spot as a Third Team All-American and All-Big 12 Second Team. Wacha was a member of the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team. He also pitched in the Big 12 Championship, NCAA College Station Regional and College World Series at the end of his sophomore year.
Professional career.
Draft and minor leagues (2012–13).
The Cardinals selected Wacha in the first round with the 19th overall selection of the 2012 MLB Draft and signed him for $1.9 million on June 14, 2012. His draft slot originally belonged to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who, upon signing Albert Pujols as a free agent, surrendered it to the Cardinals. Cardinals director of scouting Dan Kantrovitz foresaw Wacha as a future starter for the Cardinals whose size and competitive nature drew favorable comparisons with right-handers Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright. 
Ascending quickly through the minor leagues, the Cardinals first assigned Wacha to the Gulf Coast League (Rookie League) Cardinals, then promoted him to the Palm Beach Cardinals in the Florida State League and finally to the Springfield Cardinals of the Double-A Texas League before the season ended. In 21 innings pitched (IP) between the three levels, he struck out 40 batters, allowed just eight hits, four walks and two runs. With Springfield, he pitched eight innings, struck out 17 batters, and allowed just one home run (HR).
The Cardinals invited Wacha to their major league spring training camp in 2013. He impressed team management and players alike, striking out fifteen batters while only allowing one walk and one unearned run in eleven and two-thirds innings of work before being reassigned to the minor league camp.
Wacha started the 2013 season with the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, going 4–0 with a league-leading 2.05 ERA in nine games started and IP before his first call-up to the Major Leagues. His overall season totals at Memphis included a 2.65 ERA in 15 starts, 73 SO and 85 IP.
St. Louis Cardinals (2013–present).
The Cardinals activated Wacha on May 30 to make his major league debut against the Kansas City Royals at Busch Stadium. Just 364 days after throwing his last pitch for Texas A&M, Wacha was standing on a major league mound for the first time.
In his first at-bat in the majors, Wacha singled to right-center field. On the mound, he demonstrated the prodigious pitching ability that rapidly shuttled him through the minor leagues when he retired the first 13 Royals he faced before giving up a hit, a double in the fifth inning. That runner then scored after another hit. He pitched seven innings with 93 pitches (67 strikes), giving up only two hits and one run, walking none, and striking out six, leaving with a 2–1 lead. Wacha lost the chance for a win in the ninth, when Mitchell Boggs relieved and gave up a tying home run to the first batter he faced.
The Arizona Diamondbacks scored six runs against Wacha in his second start, which turned out to be a no-decision on his part. Wacha earned his first MLB win on June 11 as the Cardinals beat the New York Mets 9–2 at Citi Field. The game got off to a rough start as he gave up a home run to the second Met batter he faced, walked three others and saw his team fall behind two runs in the first inning. However, he rebounded and scattered five hits and no more walks over six total innings of work. It was Wacha's third career start. Three days after earning his first major league win, the Cardinals optioned Wacha back to Memphis to clear roster room for pitcher Jake Westbrook as he returned from the disabled list (DL). During his first stint with the Cardinals, Wacha posted a 1-0 record with an ERA of 4.58 in three starts.
The Cardinals recalled Wacha in mid-August and he was on the roster to stay for the remainder of the season. He started one game against the Chicago Cubs before being moved to the bullpen. Manager Mike Matheny placed him back in the rotation in September. He pitched six shutout innings with just three hits against the Cincinnati Reds. 
Encompassing his last regular-season game and first three playoff appearances in 2013, Wacha authored a series of masterful performances. On September 24, he pitched a no-hitter through innings against the Washington Nationals that ended when Ryan Zimmerman stroked an infield single that glanced off Wacha's glove. It was Washington's only hit as the Cardinals prevailed 2–0. It was also the third potential no-hitter lost with the final out to go on the 2013 season, after Yu Darvish and Yusmeiro Petit. Wacha finished his regular season in the Major Leagues appearing in 15 games, making nine starts and pitching innings. He surrendered 52 hits, twenty runs, five home runs and struck out 65 hitters for a 2.78 ERA.
On October 7, Wacha started his first Major League playoff game. In innings of Game 4 of the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS) – an elimination game against the Pittsburgh Pirates – he again surrendered one hit (a home run) and two walks. Due to Wacha's back-to-back one-hit performances, Matheny announced that he would start Game 2 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS). In that game on October 12, he outdueled Clayton Kershaw in innings for a 1–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. In just the 11th start of his MLB career, Wacha joined Bob Gibson as the only pitchers in franchise history to strike out at least eight batters while yielding one or no runs in consecutive postseason starts. 
Facing Kershaw again in Game 6, Wacha yielded just two hits in seven innings as his opponent unravelled in a 9–0 victory that sent the Cardinals to the World Series. Wacha won both his NLCS starts, holding the Dodgers to a .149 batting average against (BAA), two walks and 13 SO in scoreless IP as he earned the NLCS MVP. He became the fourth rookie to win a postseason MVP, following Larry Sherry (1959 World Series), Mike Boddicker (1983 NLCS), and Liván Hernández (1997 NLCS and 1997 World Series). Through the NLCS, Wacha allowed just one run on eight hits in 21 IP for a 0.43 ERA while striking out 22.
Starting Game Two of the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Wacha pitched six innings in a 4–2 Cardinals' victory, although he said after the game he "didn't have best stuff." Before surrendering a home run to David Ortiz, Wacha tied Gibson with the longest scoreless streak (19 innings) in Cardinals' postseason history. Wacha became the 17th-youngest pitcher overall to win a World Series game and the second-youngest in Cardinals history behind only Paul Dean. In Game 6, with the Cardinals facing elimination once more, Wacha was again called upon to save their season after winning four consecutive playoff starts with a 1.00 ERA and just 11 hits allowed in 27 innings for a .122 opponents' batting average. However, the Red Sox finally solved him, tagging him for six runs in innings on the way to defeating the Cardinals for their eighth World Series title.
Wacha was guaranteed a regular post in the rotation at the outset of the 2014 season, and his first two starts came against the Reds. Receiving one win and one no-decision, he furthered a strong start against them. His first career IP against them included just 13 hits and five walks allowed with 20 SO and a 0.40 ERA. In an April 24 start against the New York Mets, Wacha struck out nine batters in the first three innings. This was just the 11th such occurrence in the expansion era. With winds whipping, he struck out ten total in four innings but also walked five and required 93 pitches. Two of the walks proved costly as they were with the bases loaded; the Mets took advantage in a 3–2 triumph.
Wacha's first 15 starts of 2014 included a 2.79 ERA and 5–5 W–L. However, after pitching with lingering shoulder discomfort and fatigue in May and June, the Cardinals placed him on the DL on June 18. A series of magnetic resonance (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images revealed an injury termed as a stress reaction in the scapula behind his throwing arm. The stress reaction apparently was a case of the shoulder not repairing itself as fast as the strain from regular pitching had caused between the scapula bone and tendons.
Although similar to the stress fracture injury Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered, it was deemed less severe. According to medical opinion, it was part of the same injury process, but Wacha's injury had not progressed as far as McCarthy's as a fracture had yet to occur. Therefore, Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak stated, as "a precursor to a stress fracture, ... which is a precursor to a ... fracture," it was more manageable to correct. With limited knowledge on the related biomechanical processes, the Cardinals training and medical staff researched methods to treat Wacha's injury and circumvent the same course from happening again; likewise, they were uncertain of when he was to return to play.
Pitching profile.
Standing 6' 6" () tall and weighing , Wacha repeats the same delivery with all his pitches. Featuring a plus-plus sinking fastball that usually travels between and , Wacha frequently shows velocity up to . His high arm angle and release point create substantial downward action on his fastball. Wacha's fastball complement, a plus-plus changeup, features deep, fading movement to right-handed hitters with a to decrease in velocity from his fastball. Not only is his arm angle on the two pitches the same, the arm speed appears virtually identical to the hitter, thus disguising the difference in velocity.
Wacha's third pitch is an average curveball that travels about and has improved in break and consistency; in college, scouts considered his curveball a below average pitch. He has a fourth pitch, a slider, that lacks consistent break and darts horizontally similar to the cutter. Wacha attributed the increase in pitch velocity to gaining weight from physical exercise and increased food consumption, asserting that he "felt like the velocity just kept on increasing every single year. I changed my mechanics a little bit when I was in college, and that might have added a few ticks." Wacha added a cut fastball (commonly called a "cutter") late in the 2013 season, though he only threw the pitch 1.8% of the time. During the 2014 spring training, Wacha showed increased confidence in the pitch after finding a consistent grip.
Depending on the source, Wacha shows a wide range of potential. Scouting reports initially projected him for a potential of two plus-plus pitches (fastball and changeup) with command of both. "Baseball Prospectus" noted that his polish due to pitch command helped fast-track him to the Major Leagues. However, a dearth of vigorous fastball life escalates the importance of command. Wacha offsets the shortage of sizable vertical movement with the pronounced descent through which his fastball, changeup and curve travel to create an additional obstacle as hitters to attempt square the bat on the pitch. In addition, the drop in elevation changes the hitter's eye level. Wacha was previously criticized for a heavy reliance on the fastball from lacking a solid breaking pitch. Before refining his curveball, "Baseball Prospect Nation" commented that development of a slider "to even only an occasional 'show-me' pitch would add another element to his game and allow him to become more refined in his pitch sequencing ability to work through a lineup."
During each at-bat, Wacha does not easily give in to the batter. He maintains his composure on the mound. With both fastball and changeup being plus-plus pitches and improved command, "Baseball Prospectus" and "Baseball Prospect Nation" conclude his likely future is as a solid number-three starter. However, as command of his curve has markedly improved, so have his projections. The same initial reports stated that if he could enhance his slider's reliability, he may be able to become a low-end number two starter. Still others, such as scout Ralph Garr, Jr., and Kantrovitz, project him as a "future top-of-the-rotation guy."
Personal life.
As a play on his last name, "Wacha Wacha" became a phenomenon in 2013 following the favorite catch phrase of Fozzie Bear of the The Muppets, and for its similarity to the sound effects from the "Pac-Man" arcade game. A restaurant in St. Louis named a milkshake the "Wacha Wacha" following his 2013 NLCS MVP honors. The milkshake's ingredients included vanilla with chocolate chips and Cracker Jacks. Although he could not remember the name of the restaurant, he stated the Cracker Jacks "added a little baseball flair to it."

Kastner trial

The Attorney-General of the Government of Israel v. Malchiel Gruenwald, commonly known as the Kastner trial, was a libel case in Jerusalem, Israel. Hearings were held from 1 January to October 1954 in the District Court of Jerusalem before Judge Benjamin Halevi (1910–1996), who published his decision on 22 June 1955.
Summary.
The defendant, Malchiel Gruenwald (1881–1958), a hotelier who lost 52 relatives in the Auschwitz concentration camp, had accused Rudolf Kastner (1906–1957), a Hungarian lawyer and journalist who became a civil servant in Israel in 1947, of collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary during the Holocaust. The allegations were made in a self-published newsletter, "Letter to Friends in the Mizrachi", in August 1952.
The Israeli government sued on Kastner's behalf, calling him as one of 59 witnesses. Gruenwald was represented by Shmuel Tamir (1923–1987), a former Irgun commander, who turned the case into one that examined the actions of the governing Zionist Mapai party during the Holocaust, and what had been done to help Europe's Jews. One of the key issues was whether Kastner, who in Hungary had helped to found the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee, had in effect collaborated with Adolf Eichmann (1906–1962) and Kurt Becher (1909–1995), two SS officers, in his efforts to secure safe passage from Budapest to Switzerland in July 1944 of 1,684 Jews, on what became known as the Kastner train.
Gruenwald and Tamir accused Kastner of having failed to warn the Hungarian Jewish community that they were to be loaded onto trains and taken to the gas chambers in Auschwitz, in occupied Poland. They alleged that he had known about the gas chambers since at least the end of April 1944 – when he had received a copy of the Vrba-Wetzler report – but had neglected to inform the wider community that they were not being deported from Hungary to be "resettled," as the Nazis had said. His motive, they said, was to safeguard the release of a smaller number, which included his family and friends. In failing to alert the wider community to the danger, they alleged that he had helped the SS avoid the spread of panic among the Jewish community, which would have slowed down the transports. The judge ruled in Gruenwald's favour, accusing Kastner of having "sold his soul to the devil." Kastner was assassinated outside his home in Tel Aviv in March 1957 as a result of the decision and the subsequent publicity.
Appeal.
Most of the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of Israel in January 1958. The five judges, Chief Justice Yitzhak Olshan, Shimon Agranat, Moshe Silberg, Shneur Zalman Cheshin, and David Goitein, upheld the appeal on the charge that Kastner was guilty of the indirect murder of Hungarian Jews. Cheshin wrote: "On the basis of the extensive and diverse material which was compiled in the course of the hearing, it is easy to describe Kastner as blacker than black and place the mark of Cain on his forehead, but it is also possible to describe him as purer than the driven snow and regard him as 'the righteous of our generation.' A man who exposed himself to mortal danger in order to save others."
Four of the judges, with Silberg dissenting, also upheld the appeal on the charge that Kastner was guilty of collaboration. According to Asher Maoz, Silberg agreed with the trial judge that Kastner had "knowingly and in bad faith, fulfilled the wishes ... of the Nazis, and thereby made it easier for them to perform the work of mass destruction." All five judges dismissed the appeal related to the charge that Kastner had helped Kurt Becher escape punishment after the war by writing him a letter of recommendation.

Independent (Ai album)

Independent (stylized as INDEPENDENT) is the 9th studio album by Japanese R&B musician Ai, released on February 22, 2012. It was her first album with EMI Music Japan, after parting with Universal Music Japan after eight years with the label.
The single "Happiness," which was used in a high profile Coca Cola winter 2011 advertising campaign, was her most successful single since "I'll Remember You" in 2007, receiving two different gold certifications. The album debuted at number two on Oricon's album charts, and sold over 60,000 copies, outselling her previous two studio albums, "Viva Ai" (2009) and "The Last Ai" (2010).
On November 17, the deluxe edition of the album will be released, featuring bonus tracks, and an additional live CD with audio from her "Independent Tour 2012 – Live in Budokan" concert to be released in December.
Background and development.
After the release of "The Last Ai" in 2010, Ai parted ways with Universal Music Japan, and signed to EMI Music Japan in June 2011. On December 13 and 14, 2011, Ai was one of the lead acts of the "Michael Jackson Tribute Live" tributes in Japan. She performed Michael Jackson's vocals in the third act, along with the Jacksons. Her first release under EMI, the digital single "Letter in the Sky" featuring the Jacksons, was the theme song for the event. "Densetsu Night", a concert recording for the tour of her previous album, "The Last Ai" (2010), was also released under EMI prior to the album.
Writing and production.
The album was written by Ai, collaborating with American and Japanese producers. Of the 10 tracks, nine featured lyrics exclusively written by Ai, and eight featured input from Ai on the musical melody.
The album was recorded over a period of seven months, in Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo. The bulk of the album was recprded at Eagle Rock, Los Angeles. "Letter in the Sky" was recorded in Hollywood, and "Happiness," "Yume no Mukou" and "Utsukushiki Mono" were recorded in Tokyo. Ai felt that moving to a new label was a chance to refresh her music. In the album sessions, Ai felt challenged in many ways. "Dance Together," an electronic song, was something she had never thought of making, as she previously thought she did not enjoy the genre. Ai considered "Utsukushiki Mono" as the most vocally challenging song she had recorded. She used much more of her falsetto range on the album than in previous works. The lyrics of the album were more "heartfelt" than her previous albums, in particular "One Love" and "Happiness." "Happiness" was written with the feelings and mindset Ai had in the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
The album consists of only 10 songs, as she decided it was better to focus on a small number of quality songs. Ai usually felt pressured to record a great number of songs before the album session deadline in the past.
The album was named after its lead track, "Independent Woman."
Promotion and release.
The first digital single from the album, "Letter in the Sky," was released in October 2011. The major promotions of the album centred around the song "Happiness," which was first released in November 2011, and later as a physical single in December 2012. The song was used in a high profile winter commercial campaign for Coca Cola. The song was highly successful, receiving two separate gold certifications from the RIAJ. This was her most highly certified single since 2007's "I'll Remember You."
Prior to the album, three digital singles were released. "One Love" and "Utsukushiki Mono" were simultaneously released on February 1, 2012. "Utsukushiki Mono" was used as the ending theme song for the animated film "Berserk Golden Age Arc I: The Egg of the High King", based on the manga "Berserk". "One Love" was used in Morinaga's "1 Choco for 1 Smile" charity campaign.
The leading track, "Independent Woman," was released a week before the album on February 15, 2012. A music video was recorded for the song, which was later nominated for the "Best R&B video" at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. The song was used as the commercial song for "Marisol" magazine's March and April 2012 TV campaign. "Independent Woman" was featured in the 2012 Wii dance game "Just Dance Wii 2", a Japan only game in the Just Dance franchise, as one of the playable tracks.
Ai appeared in a variety of magazines, and on many radio shows to promote her album. These included radio appaearances on J-Wave, Nack5 and FM Fuji. She was interviewed in a variety of magazines for the album, including "An An", "Blenda", "Fine", "Popteen", "Samurai Magazine" and "Woofin"'. A TV special, "Ai Special: Independent", was produced and aired on Music On! TV in February 2012.
Tours.
Ai supported the album during her "Independent" tour, held between April and June 2012 across Japan. 23 dates in 23 cities were performed, with the final performed at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan hall on June 22. An additional concert will be performed at Los Angeles on August 24, 2012, at Club Nokia.
Critical reception.
Critical reception for the album was favorible. The reviewer at "Listen Japan" was overwhelmed by the strong impressions of all of the tracks, including the "heavy bass and trancey synths" on "Dance Together," "Futuristic Lover" that "shines with '80s style synths." The reviewer felt all the different songs felt extremely modern and trendy, and noted the varied vocals between songs. "CD Journal" considered the album's "borderless strength and depth" impressive. Of the lead single "Happiness/Letter in the Sky," the reviewer enjoyed both songs, but much preferred "Letter in the Sky," feeling that Jackie Jackson's lead vocals were "loaded with soul." "Listen Japan"'s Morio Mori thought "Happiness"' "catchy hook and autotuned voice" could make hearts dance. Takuro Ueno of "Rolling Stone Japan" awarded the album 3.5 stars out of 5, feeling that it was an album that expressed Ai's "pronounced personality" very well. Tetso Hiraga of "Hot Express", however, was more impressed by the album's lyrical themes of "the potential of mankind" and unity than the song.
Chart performance.
"Independent" debuted at number two in its first week, selling 21,000 copies. This was the highest position Ai had reached with a studio album since "What's Goin' On Ai" in 2006. The album charted for 21 weeks in the top 300, eventually tripling its first week to sell 61,000 copies. This was Ai's best selling original album in five years, since "Don't Stop Ai" in 2007.

Municipality of Tolmin

The Municipality of Tolmin () is a municipality in northwestern Slovenia. Its centre and the largest settlement is Tolmin.
History.
In ancient times the area was inhabited by the Illyrians and then by the Romans. In the 6th century the Slavs, ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the area.
Until 1420 it belonged to the Patriarchate of Aquileia, when it was acquired by the Republic of Venice. In 1514 it became a possession of the Habsburgs, who gave it as fief to the Coronini-Cronberg family. Medieval documents testify to a long series of uprisings, culminating in the Tolmin peasant revolt of 1713. That particular insurgence spread from Tolmin County to the Vipava Valley, Karst, and Brda, and further on to northern Istria. The uprising was mercilessly crushed by the imperial army and its eleven leaders were beheaded.
In the 16th century, the area became part of the County of Gorizia and Gradisca. During the World War I, Tolmin served as a base for the victorious breach of the Soča/Isonzo Front. Occupied by Italian troops at the end of 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Italy between 1918 and 1943 (nominally to 1947) as a commune of the Province of Gorizia (as Tolmino), except during the period between 1924 and 1927, when the Province of Gorizia was abolished and annexed to the Province of Udine. and between 1943 and 1945 of the Nazi German Operational Zone Adriatic Coast. In 1945 it was liberated by the Yugoslav partisans and in 1947 it was officially annexed to Yugoslavia. Since then, it has been an integral part of Slovenia.
Geography.
The Tolmin area includes the Tolminka and Zadlaščica basins at the entrance to Triglav National Park, which are also its lowest point (180 m). A special feature of the Tolminka Basins is a thermal spring at the end of the path. The region also boasts several record-holding waterfalls (Brinta Falls 104 m, Gregorčič Falls 88 m) and several other smaller waterfalls hidden in the ravines of Cold Creek (), Godiča Creek, Pščak Creek, and Sopotnica Creek.
Culture.
Tolmin has been the venue for the Metalcamp heavy metal festival and Soča Reggae Riversplash festival.
Politics.
The Municipality of Tolmin is governed by a mayor elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council of 22 members. The local political scene is relatively diversified, with no prevalence of a particular party, although the conservative New Slovenia and Slovenian People's Party tend to receive a higher proportion of votes than their national average. Traditionally, the left-wing and liberal parties have been stronger in the town center, whereas the countryside tends to favor conservative parties. In national politics, the Tolmin electoral district has highly favored the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party, but this is largely due to the prevalence of this party in the other two municipalities forming the district, (Bovec and Kobarid).

120 Squadron SAAF

120 Squadron SAAF was a South African Air Force squadron formed in 1970 to operate the South African/French Cactus surface to air missile systems in an air defence role. The unit was disbanded when the Cactus system was retired from service in the late 1980s.
History and deployment.
In July 1964, South Africa placed a development contract with Thomson-CSF for a mobile, all-weather, low-altitude SAM system after a South African order for the Bloodhound SAM system was refused by the UK government. The South African government paid 85 per cent of the development costs of the system with the balance being paid for by France. The system was known as "Cactus" within the SAAF and "Crotale" in France. The units were operationally deployed in platoons in 1971 with each platoon consisting of one Acquisition and Co-ordination Unit (ACU) and two or three firing units, with a battery having two platoons. All Cactus air defence batteries were placed under command of 120 Squadron until the retirement of the system in the late 1980s.

The Break Up (Glee)

"The Break Up" is the fourth episode of the fourth season of the American musical television series "Glee", and the 70th episode overall. Written by Ryan Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, it aired on Fox in the United States on October 4, 2012, and features the end of several long-established romantic relationships on the show: the couples Finn and Rachel, Kurt and Blaine, and Santana and Brittany all break up.
Plot.
In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) reunites with her former fiancé, Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), who has been discharged from the Army, and gives him a tour through the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), causing Finn to feel out of place. Meanwhile, in Lima, Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), feeling neglected by his boyfriend, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), who is busy with his work at Vogue.com, cheats on him. Finn and Blaine sing Duncan Sheik's "Barely Breathing" and Blaine, feeling guilty, decides to surprise Kurt by visiting him in New York City.
Finn, Rachel, Kurt and Blaine attend a local bar where NYADA students meet, and where Finn runs into Brody Weston (Dean Geyer). Suspicious of his and Rachel's relationship, Finn encourages them to sing Demi Lovato's "Give Your Heart a Break" together. They are followed by Blaine, who performs a heartfelt acoustic version of Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream." Outside, Finn and Kurt confront Rachel and Blaine, and Rachel admits to kissing Brody, while Blaine admits to cheating on Kurt, leading to them singing No Doubt's "Don't Speak" as they return to Rachel and Kurt's apartment.
The following day, Finn leaves without telling Rachel and returns to Lima, where he visits glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and breaks down in his arms. Finn is introduced to the new members of New Directions and suggests that they perform "Grease" for the school musical, which impresses Will. Will later tells Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), that he has been accepted to the blue ribbon government panel to improve arts education nationwide, but that it requires him to move to Washington, D.C. for six months. Emma is reluctant to leave Lima for such a long time to accompany Will, and they argue, but do not break up.
Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) visits her girlfriend, Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), and learns that she joined a club created by cheerleader Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) to prepare for the rapture. Kitty's boyfriend, Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), invites Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) to one of the meetings, but becomes disappointed when Kitty uses it to play a harmful prank on one of the members. Jake eventually decides to break up with Kitty after she mistreats Marley, but also ignores Marley's romantic advances. 
Santana serenades Brittany with Taylor Swift's "Mine" and confides with Brittany that their relationship isn't working due to the long distance and her new priorities. She and Brittany break up, which leaves Brittany devastated. Blaine continuously attempts to contact Kurt, but Kurt won't communicate with him, and he becomes uncertain of where they're standing.
Rachel, having flown all the way to Lima, confronts Finn at the McKinley auditorium, where she calls him immature and a coward for hiding from her for months. She says she loves him, but states that she can't keep their current relationship up, and she breaks up with him despite Finn's claims that he was giving her freedom. She gives him a last kiss, and leaves. After she leaves, Finn performs Coldplay's "The Scientist" alone, and imagines that Rachel, Kurt, Blaine, Santana, Brittany, Will and Emma are there performing with him.
Production.
In a July 2012 interview with "E! News", Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that." Colfer quipped that he did not know what was in store for the couple, "I hear mixed things. I hear they're still together but then maybe they're breaking up." In a September 2012 interview with the same publication, on whether the couple would breakup or not in the show's fourth season, Criss stated, "I don't know. We still have episodes to shoot." Criss ultimately echoed Colfer's sentiment, "We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!" Prior to the episode's debut, series co-creator Ryan Murphy dubbed it "the best episode we have ever done".
Scenes from the episode were filmed on location in New York City the weekend of August 11 and 12, 2012, including the walk through the park for the song "Don't Speak".
Recurring characters in this episode include McKinley guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Mays), glee club members Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), Wade "Unique" Adams (Alex Newell), Marley Rose (Benoist) and Jake Puckerman (Artist), cheerleader Kitty (Tobin), NYADA junior Brody Weston (Geyer) and Vogue.com employee Chase Madison (Dan Domenech). 
Six songs are being released as singles, including Duncan Sheik's "Barely Breathing" performed by Criss and Monteith, No Doubt's "Don't Speak" performed by Colfer, Criss, Monteith and Michele, Coldplay's "The Scientist" performed by Monteith, Michele, Colfer, Criss, Rivera, Morris, Morrison and Mays, Demi Lovato's "Give Your Heart a Break" performed by Michele and Geyer, Taylor Swift's "Mine" performed by Rivera, and an acoustic version of Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" performed by Criss.

Sentiocentrism

Sentiocentrism or sentio-centrism describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern. All and only sentient beings (animals that feel, including humans) have intrinsic value and moral standing; the rest of the natural world has instrumental value. Both humans and other sentient animals have rights and/or interests that must be considered.
The sentiocentrists consider that the discrimination of sentient beings of other species is speciesism, an arbitrary discrimination. Therefore, the coherent sentiocentrism means taking into consideration and respect all sentient animals.
History of term.
The utilitarian criterion of moral standing is, therefore, all and only sentient beings (sentiocentrism). The 18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham compiled Enlightenment beliefs in "Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation" (second edition, 1823, chapter 17, footnote), and he included his own reasoning in a comparison between slavery and sadism toward animals:
Peter Singer, in "A Utilitarian Defense of Animal Liberation" (pags. 73-82); Tom Regan, in "The Radical Egalitarian Case for Animal Rights" (pags. 82-90) and Warren, in "A Critique of Regan's Animal Rights Theory" (pags. 90-97) they talk about sentiocentrism.
Sentiocentrism is a term contained in the "Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare", edited by Marc Bekoff.

United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division

United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division, , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify a rate in a natural gas supply contract if the contract specified that the rate was that of the rate schedule filed with the Federal Power Commission (FPC) and the gas company filed a new rate schedule. This case clarified the "Mobile-Sierra" doctrine established by "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp." (1956) and its companion case "Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co." (1956), which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA).
Background.
The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates.
The United Gas Pipe Line Co., a natural gas pipeline company that operated in several states and was subject to regulation under the NGA, provided gas under long term contracts to distribution companies such as the Texas Gas Transportation Corp., Southern Natural Gas Co., and the Mississippi Valley Gas Co. The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases in the cost of gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas rate schedule on file with the FPC or any effective rate schedule. On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new rate schedule. The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its "Mobile Gas" decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new rate schedule could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new rate schedule. The FPC upheld the new rate schedule on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the "going" rate on the effective United Gas rate schedule, and distinguished "Mobile Gas" as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.
The distribution companies and MLGW appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which then reversed the FPC in an opinion which held that "Mobile Gas" had established that the FPC could review the new rate schedule only if the customers of a gas company consented to the filing of the schedule. The Supreme Court granted certiorari based on a claim that the Court of Appeals misunderstood the "Memphis Gas" decision.
Opinion.
In a majority opinion by Justice Harlan, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, stating that it "misconceived" the "Mobile Gas" decision. "Mobile Gas" involved contracts to supply gas at a specific price, and the NGA did not permit a gas pipeline company to abrogate the contract by filing a new rate schedule. In "Memphis", United Gas and the distribution companies had agreed in the contract that the price would be the current "going" rate, which left United Gas able to revise the rate by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC subject only to review for lawfulness under the NGA. The Court explained that in allowing gas companies and customers to determine gas rates through contracts in the NGA, Congress was indicating that the public interest not only required protection of customers from excessive gas costs, but also recognized the legitimate interest of natural gas companies. The opinion staed that natural gas companies, in order to protect their ability to access financial markets, must be able to raise rates in order to fund the maintenance of gas systems and its expansion through debt and securities. This was a proper concern of Congress in enacting the NGA as noted in "Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co." (1944). Lastly, the opinion noted that "going" rate contracts were common, and the ability of gas companies to revise the "going" rate by filing new rate schedules had not previously been considered to be an issue.
Justice Douglas in his dissenting opinion stated that it had been his understanding that "Mobile Gas" required that rates in gas contracts could only be revised under the NGA with the agreement of the parties, which would include the customers.
In "Memphis", the oral argument before the Supreme Court on behalf of the FPC was made by U.S. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin.
Subsequent events.
A motion for rehearing of the decision was denied by the Supreme Court in 1959.
Although the dissenting opinion in "Memphis" suggested that the decision would "make a shambles" of the administration of the NGA as far as customer interests were concerned, the Supreme Court did not find it necessary to rule on issues involving the "Mobile-Sierra" doctrine for another fifty years. In "Morgan Stanley Capital Group v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, Washington" (2008), the Court held that the restrictions against the modification of contracts also applied to customers with unfavorable rates. One reference describes the "Mobile Gas", "Sierra Power", and "Memphis" cases as the first chapter of the "Mobile-Sierra" doctrine, with "Morgan Stanley" as the second chapter and "NRG Power Marketing, LLC v. Maine Public Utilities Commission" (2010) as the third.
On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Royal Ordnance Factory Leeds, first opened in December 1915 and first opened as an ROF in January 1936, it was one of a number of Royal Ordnance Factories created at the start of the Second World War.
Background.
R.O.F. Engineering Factory
First opened as a munitions factory in December 1915
First opened as an ROF January 1936
One of a number of Royal Ordnance Factories created at the start of the Second World War
Early site history and production.
First World War.
Barnbow was Britain's top shell factory between 1914 and 1918, and by the end of the war on 11 November 1918, a total of 566,000 tons of ammunition had been shipped overseas.
Second World War.
Conversion to an Engineering ROF.
In the late 1930s, war was seen as a possibility, if not likely, and a sizeable rearmament programme began, probably also activated by the concern that a large proportion of the arsenal was becoming obsolete.
Post-war.
Immediate Post-war.
In November 1945 full production began on the uparmoured Centurion Mark II with an order of 800 with production lines at Leyland, the Royal Ordnance Factories at Leeds and Woolwich, and Vickers at Elswick. The tank entered service in December 1946 with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment.
Later years.
The Challenger was built by the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROF). In 1986, ROF Leeds (and the Challenger production line) was acquired by Vickers Defence Systems (later Alvis Vickers).
Privatisation of Royal Ordnance.
On 2 January 1985, "Vesting day", the twelve ROFs that still remained open, plus the Waltham Abbey South site, RSAF Enfield and three Agency Factories, became a UK Government-owned company: Royal Ordnance plc. Its headquarters was moved to ROF Chorley, Lancashire; with its registered office located in central London. The intention of the government at this stage was to privatise Royal Ordnance as soon as possible through a stock market flotation.
In mid-1985 a target date of July 1986 was set; however, by June 1986 the government announced that flotation would not be possible and that it intended to sell the company privately. The following problems were identified as barriers to a flotation:
The problems associated with ROF Leeds were solved when Royal Ordnance agreed the sale of the factory and intellectual property rights of the Challenger tanks to Vickers plc on 4 October 1986, the final agreement was signed on 31 March 1987 valuing ROF Leeds at £15.2 million. Vickers became Alvis Vickers and, in 2004, became part of BAE Systems, and the Leeds factory was closed. The relationship with the MOD was resolved by certain guarantees given to the company by the MOD regarding future procurement strategies. The financial position of the company was resolved by a Treasury cash injection and the proceeds of the ROF Leeds sale. The liabilities were with regard to a sub-contract for a missile systems between British Aerospace (BAe) and an MOD research establishment transferred to Royal Ordnance on Incorporation; BAe and the MOD reached agreement in February 1987.
Bids for Royal Ordnance Plc were invited in October 1986, resulting in six offers. These were eventually reduced to two; one from British Aerospace and one from Guest, Keen & Nettlefolds (GKN). The £188.5 million GBP BAe offer was accepted, and the sale was completed on 22 April 1987.
Closure.
ROF Leeds was finally closed in 2004. The land has since become an industrial estate. (Radial Park)

Dihydrostilbenoid

Dihydrostilbenoids (bibenzyls) are natural phenols formed from the dihydrostilbene (bibenzyl) backbone.
Examples.
Dihydro-resveratrol is a natural phenol with a bibenzyl structure found in wine. It is also a metabolite of trans-resveratrol formed in the intestine by the hydrogenation of the double bond by microflora.
Combretastatin and combretastatin B-1 are two dihydrostilbenoids found in "Combretum caffrum", an African tree.
Isonotholaenic acid is another dihydrostilbenoid found in the Andean fern "Argyrochosma nivea".
Bibenzyls (3,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxybibenzyl, 3,3'-dihydroxy-5-methoxybibenzyl (batatasin III)) can be found in the orchid "Bulbophyllum vaginatum".
Bis(bibenzyls) and macrocyclic bis(benzyls) can be found in bryophytes, such as the compounds plagiochin E, 13,13'-O-isoproylidenericcardin D, riccardin H, marchantin E, neomarchantin A, marchantin A and marchantin B in the Chinese liverwort "Marchantia polymorpha". Prenylated bibenzyls can be isolated from the New Zealand liverwort "Marsupidium epiphytum" or from "Radula kojana".
One unique class of stilbenoid derivative was first isolated from "Scorzonera humilis". They were named the tyrolobibenzyls after Tyrol in the eastern Alps, where the plant was collected.

AAirpass

The AAirpass is a membership-based discount program offered by American Airlines to frequent flyers.
Introduction and conditions.
It was launched in 1981 and initially comprised conditions which would allow passholders unlimited first class travel on any of the airline's flights worldwide. Lifetime membership was priced at $250,000, with the option to purchase a companion pass for an additional $150,000. The membership fee was raised subsequently, up to a point of $3 million for life in 2004, but no passes were sold at this price. A total of 66 AAirpasses are reported to have been sold under the unlimited travel conditions. Consequently, the AAirpass can be said essentially to have imported the concept of a flat rate or a free travel pass, which is most frequently found in public mass transport systems, into passenger air traffic.
Current status.
The program has since been discontinued; American Airlines still sells memberships under the AAirpass brand, but rather than unrestricted free flights, this product gives passholders the option to purchase tickets at fixed (and discounted, when compared to typical airfare), pre-set rates rather than the variable pricing that has become widespread practice in the industry. Extant unlimited travel AAirpasses issued in the past remain valid, however.
Profitability for American Airlines and termination of passes.
The original lifetime AAirpass program has turned out to cause substantial losses to American Airlines due to unexpectedly heavy usage of the privileges by some members; an internal study reportedly concluded that each passholder caused losses of about $1 million per year to the company, although it remains unclear whether this is an overall average across all passholders or only a figure for particularly frequent flyers. One of the reasons for these figures is the fact that members can collect air miles for flights which they received for free under the AAirpass, allowing some passengers to accumulate tens of millions of miles. Another major cost factor are taxes and airport fees on these flights, which are paid for by the airline. The program has been called "a huge disaster" for the company.
American Airlines has since revoked some passes, invoking evidence produced by a special investigative unit of allegedly fraudulent use of the pass by members. Some affected passengers have initiated legal proceedings against the termination of their membership, but the actions are suspended as long as the airline remains under Chapter 11 protection.

Centennial Lake (Renfrew County)

Centennial Lake is a reservoir lake in the Township of Greater Madawaska, Renfrew County and the Township of North Frontenac, Frontenac County in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is on the Madawaska River and is part of the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin.
The lake is "L" shaped, with the downstroke oriented northwest/southeast, and the cross stroke oriented northeast/southwest. All but a tiny tip at the south end of the lake, the crux of the "L", is in the Township of Greater Madawaska, Renfrew County. The major inflow, at Camel Chute at the northwest, is the Madawaska River. A second primary inflow is Mackie Creek at the south, controlled by a weir dam. The major outflow is also the Madawaska River, which flows directly into Black Donald Lake at the northeast. The Madawaska River then flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River and thence to the Atlantic Ocean. Renfrew County Road 65 crosses the northwest arm of the lake over a long, low, concrete bridge.
History.
Centennial Lake, and Black Donald Lake adjacent downstream, were created by the construction of the Mountain Chute Generating Station and dam and an associated embankment dam in 1965–1966. Black Donald Lake subsumed the previous White Fish Lake and drowned the former mining community of Black Donald Mines, whose graphite mine by then had been exhausted. The reservoir took six months to fill and flooded .
The lake is primarily used for recreation, tourism and cottages.

Cantonment Reno

Cantonment Reno also known as Fort McKinney 1 was a US Army post or cantonment located on the Powder River near the old Bozeman Trail crossing. A previous fort near the site
(Fort Reno) had been abandoned and burned after the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. Cantonment Reno was re-established in late 1876, just upstream of the site of old Fort Reno. Cantonment Reno started as a temporary base of operations for General George Crooks’ 1876 Big Horn Expedition. Crook's Expedition was part of the intensive campaign against the Sioux and Cheyenne in late 1876, following Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
Construction.
The construction of the cantonment began on October 14, 1876, and work was completed on December 19, 1876. The total cost of materials (doors, windows, hardware and lumber) was $931.91. US Army troops did most of the work, but civilian employees received an additional $170.00 in wages. The structures included a storehouse, two storage cellars, barracks (19 huts), a hospital, a mess room and kitchen, nine officers huts, a shed, a corral, teamster's hut, a blacksmith's shop, and a bakery for a total of forty-two structures. A wooden bridge was built across the river in March and April of 1877.
One of the cantonment's surgeons left a description of the hospital: "The hospital at this station is one log hut, 14 x 16 feet, occupied as a ward and dispensary, having a dirt floor and covered with dirt. The height of the roof from the floor inside is 9 feet on one side and 10 feet on the other, giving one foot slope to it; this room has five small windows and one door, and is heated when necessary by one stove."
Fort McKinney 1.
On November 25, 1876, part of Crook's command, under the leadership of Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie, attacked a village of Cheyenne ("Dull Knife's village") on the nearby Red Fork of the Powder River. The army surprised and scattered the Cheyennes driving men, women and children out of their village into subzero temperatures and snow on the open prairie. The battle is known as the Dull Knife Fight or the Battle of Bates Creek. Cantonment Reno provided logistic support for the attack, and rudimentary care for the army wounded from the battle. Lieutenant John A. McKinney was one of the 25 American soldiers killed in the Dull Knife Fight.
In May 1877, elements of the Fifth Cavalry established a camp on Clear Creek, near present-day Buffalo, Wyoming. On June 16, 1877, the officer in charge of the camp named it "Camp McKinney", in honor of the officer who was killed in the Dull Knife Fight. However, since this was only a temporary camp, no one at headquarters recognized the name. However, this camp developed into Fort McKinney (Wyoming) also known as Fort McKinney 2, the fort near Buffalo.
At about the same time, the commander of Cantonment Reno asked his superiors that his Cantonment be renamed "Cantonment or Camp McKinney." This was because mail for Cantonment Reno was being mixed up with mail directed to Fort Reno (Oklahoma). On August 30, 1877, the War Department officially renamed Cantonment Reno as Fort McKinney. This duplication of names has led to endless confusion over the years between Fort McKinney 1 (Cantonment Reno) and Fort McKinney 2, Fort McKinney (Wyoming).
Abandonment.
By 1878, Cantonment Reno was experiencing lumber, forage and water shortages. After considerable study a decision was made to relocate the post to the new Fort McKinney, 45 miles northwest, to a site on the Clear Fork of the Powder River. The new site of Fort McKinney was on benchlands just north of the Clear Fork, about two miles west of present-day Buffalo, Wyoming.
By the end of 1878, the Army had vacated Cantonment Reno/Fort McKinney 1. Only a small detail of soldiers remained to take care of the depot and repair the telegraph line. Doors, window sashes, and hardware were stripped from the cantonment to supply the new post on Clear Fork, leaving the hulls of post buildings. On December 10, 1878 Major Verling K. Hart, commander at the new Fort McKinney, recommended that a section of land at the old post be retained as a campground, so the land at Cantonment Reno remains publicly owned.
Powder River Crossing.
On May 13, 1879, the commander of Fort McKinney allowed a "Mr. Freron" to open a store and eating house (but not a bar) in the abandoned sutler's store at Cantonment Reno. "Mr. Freron" was Moreton Frewen, an English rancher in the Powder River country. The three-man caretaker detail at the cantonment was withdrawn in late 1879, and civilians took over the telegraph operation. In January 1880, the Rock River Stage Company received permission to move one of the log stables across the Powder River. This was the beginning of the settlement known as Powder River Crossing.
Current Status.
The Cantonment Reno site is one square mile in size. Its boundary lines are the historic boundary lines of the McKinney Military Reservation, which coincides to some extent with Section 17, T44N, R78W. The site is located on County Road 76, five miles north of the intersection with Wyoming Highway 192, about twenty miles east of Kaycee, Wyoming. Today no structures remain of the cantonment, but shallow depressions in the ground are evidence of their former existence. Removal of structures and artifacts is a part of the history of Cantonment Reno. Scattered widely throughout the site are fragments of metal, wood and glass, reminders of what once could be found at the depot. An instance of wholesale removal of artifacts from this historic site occurred as late as 1962. The site is administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

Madécasse

Madécasse Chocolate is a Brooklyn-based chocolate manufacturer established in 2006 by two Peace Corps volunteers who served in Madagascar. The company produces a range of chocolate bars and vanilla products, all of which are grown, made and packaged on the island of Madagascar. Since several years, Madécasse sub-contracts their chocolate production to Cinagra, a local chocolate producer based in Antananarivo. Madécasse has achieved much recognition for being a pioneer of social change and claims to make four times the economic impact of fair trade practices alone.
History.
Founders Brett Beach and Tim McCollum met while serving as Peace Corps volunteers in Madagascar. After spending a combined eight years on the island, McCollum and Beach felt that they wanted to have more of an impact and that “business was needed for real (social and environmental) change.” Cocoa had always been a major export of Madagascar but very little chocolate had been produced on the island, much like in the rest of Africa. Even though the continent grows over 65% of the world's cocoa, less than 1% of the world’s chocolate is made there. The two were determined to have a significant impact on the island they had come to love, and formulated an innovative business model for a chocolate business. They would produce chocolate on the island, and the majority of the economic benefit would stay within the country. The two reunited back in the United States and started the company at Beach’s residence in Lawrence, Kansas.
Madécasse partnered with the cocoa farmers of the Ezaka Cooperative, from a remote area of Madagascar. The company initially had trouble meeting the quality standards of the United States, as the cocoa beans needed more fermentation and drying. McCollum said, “You have farmers farming cocoa who have never eaten chocolate.” Madécasse trained the farmers, invested in equipment, and developed a bonus program for the cooperative. Since the company established a consistent process for producing high quality cocoa, it has achieved critical acclaim for its chocolates. Madécasse partnered with a factory on the island that has steadily increased their production outcome, according to Michaël Chauveau, director of operations in Madagascar. As Madécasse expanded, it ventured out and partnered with more farming cooperatives in order to meet demand.
There was room for growth in other markets besides chocolate, as Madagascar provided 60% of the world’s vanilla beans. Madécasse exports vanilla beans and extract from Madagascar to replicate the effect that they have with their chocolate bars in the vanilla sector. Now, Madécasse has offices in Brooklyn, managed by McCollum, and San Francisco, managed by Beach. The company has gone from simply producing dark chocolate to experimenting with new flavors, such as Arabica Coffee and Sea Salt & Nibs.
Investment and Strategic Management.
In late 2009, Madécasse approached Prosperity Equity Partners, LLC, an investment and advisory firm focused on SME investments in sub-Saharan Africa, for financing and strategic guidance.
Prosperity Equity CEO John Ferry first joined Madécasse as lead investor and advisor, and since early 2010 as head of Madécasse cocoa operations in Madagascar. As CEO of Madécasse, he oversaw fund-raising and business development for Madécasse.
Prosperity Equity Partners, LLC is the majority equity shareholder of Madécasse.
Cocoa Company of Madagascar (COCOMA).
Prosperity Equity Partners, LLC of Madagascar has an inspiring story to tell about fine chocolate making in Africa. Although 65% of the world’s cocoa is grown in Africa, less than 1% of chocolate is made on the continent. Capitalizing on the excellence of Madagascar’s distinctive genetic cacao varietal and ideal growing conditions, COCOMA Sarl (Cocoa Company of Madagascar) works with farmer partners in northern Madagascar to harvest the world's best premium quality cocoa which is produced as finished chocolate under the Madécasse brand.
The cacao beans are organically grown by forest-farm co-operatives who are committed to sustainable farming so as to protect the country’s rare biodiversity. Farmer’s benefit from training, equipment, social programs and a stable market that ensures that they earn above fair trade prices for their cacao. Prosperity Equity Partners, LLC, through COCOMA, is re-defining the cocoa landscape in Madagascar as the world's premium producer of superior quality cocoa and model of farmer prosperity and what can be done in Africa.
Products.
The products, as listed on the Madécasse website, are as follows.
Recognition.
The company has achieved much recognition for its innovative business model, local impact, and the chocolate itself.
Madécasse has been named:
It is currently in the process of being certified fair trade by Fair for Life.

Tau (1/3)

Tau is a public artwork by American artist Tony Smith, located on the urban campus of Hunter College, in New York City, New York, United State of America. Fascinated by mathematics, biology and crystals, Smith designed "Tau" with geometry at its root.
Description.
American artist Tony Smith created "Tau" (1/3) in 1961-62. Its title refers to the Greek letter 'T', which also describes the shape of the sculpture. Intended as one of three limited editions, its sister, Tau (AP), was fabricated at Lippincott Foundry, and installed in 2006 at Meadowlands Park, in his hometown of South Orange.
Many of Smith's sculptures were made up of a space lattice: groupings of simple platonic solids, in "Tau"'s case two such solids, octahedrons and tetrahedrons. The original model for the sculpture was created by Smith in 1961-62 using his signature process of joining small cardboard tetrahedrons, a process he began while recuperating after a severe automobile accident in the spring of 1961.
During this period, Smith was transitioning from his 20-year career in architecture to focus on painting and making sculptures. Smith had also started teaching at Hunter College, New York, in 1962. It took over 20 years for the piece to be installed outside the upper east side college at the 6 train's 68th Street entrance in 1984. In 2004, Hunter College held an exhibition, "Tracing Tau", curated by William C. Agee that offered an insight into the sculpture and its beginnings through paper models, drawings and plans of the work.

"Tau" forms part of Smith's series of cast bronze and painted steel sculptures including "Amaryllis" (1965) and "The Snake Is Out" (1962), all evolution of his first titled sculpture, "Throne" (1956–57). Though "Tau" is one of Smith's less publicized works, it is part of a body of work inspired by his oft-cited, revelatory road trip to the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike in the early 1950s. "When I was teaching at Cooper Union in the first year or two of the '50s, someone told me how I could get on to the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike. I took three students and drove from somewhere in the Meadows to New Brunswick. It was a dark night and there were no lights or shoulder markers, lines, railings or anything at all except the dark pavement moving through the landscape of the flats, rimmed by hills in the distance, but punctuated by stacks, towers, fumes and colored lights. This drive was a revealing experience. The road and much of the landscape was artificial, and yet it couldn't be called a work of art. On the other hand, it did something for me that art had never done. At first I didn't know what it was, but its effect was to liberate me from many of the views I had had about art. It seemed that there had been a reality there which had not had any expression in art."
"The experience on the road was something mapped out but not socially recognized. I thought to myself, it ought to be clear that's the end of art. Most paintings look pretty pictorial after that. There is no way you can frame it, you just have to experience it. Later I discovered some abandoned airstrips in Europe -- abandoned works, Surrealist landscapes, something that had nothing to do with any function, created worlds without tradition. Artificial landscape without cultural precedent began to dawn on me. This is a drill ground in Nuremberg, large enough to accommodate two million men. The entire field is enclosed with high embankments and towers. The concrete approach is three 16-inch steps, one above the other, stretching for a mile or so."

Sibley Lake Dam

Sibley Lake Dam is a dam in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.
The earthen dam was constructed in 1962 with a height of 36 feet and a length at its crest of 6520 feet. It impounds the Youngs Bayou for municipal water supply for the city of Natchitoches. The dam is owned and operated by the city and local Water Works District Number One. Both lake and dam are named for an early settler and Indian agent in the area, Dr. John Sibley. 
The reservoir it creates, Sibley Lake, has a water surface of 3.4 square miles, a shoreline of about 38 linear miles, and a maximum capacity of 56,700 acre-feet. The natural wetlands on this site known as Lac Terre Noir was drained in the early twentieth century, then re-developed as a reservoir and water source. Recreation on the lake, including hunting, boating, camping, and fishing (for white crappie, channel catfish and largemouth bass) requires an annual permit from the city.

A Satellite Cloud Image is an image based on data from meteorological satellite instruments. It captures the distribution of clouds in the atmosphere, to find the weather system and verify the correctness of surface weather maps that have been drawn. It can also be used with observations of sea ice distribution to determine the sea surface temperature and the medium-and long-term weather forecast oceanographic data. 
This technology can be a single image to show a variety of scales of weather phenomena to provide a very useful remote sensing data, weather analysis and forecasting. In general, the satellite cloud can be divided into the Infra-red satellite, visible satellite cloud images and color enhancement of satellite cloud.

I'm in Disgrace

"I'm in Disgrace" is the opening track on the second side of The Kinks' 1975 concept album, "Schoolboys in Disgrace". It was written by Ray Davies.
Background.
"I'm in Disgrace" plays an important role in the plot line of "Schoolboys in Disgrace" lyrically, as it describes the main character, Jack (a young Mr. Flash), being publicly disgraced for his inappropriate behavior with his former girlfriend. According to Jack, the first two times that he saw her, he was in love with the girl, but because he was treated "with such distaste" the third time, 
he now wishes he'd "never seen face." Now, because he "fell for [her pretty face", he's "in disgrace" and his "name's dirt." However, he claims that "it wasn't lust, it wasn't rape, 
it was just a mistake" and says to his girlfriend that "There's no use blaming me and saying I was your ruination Because it was you equally That got us into this situation." In the next track on the album, "Headmaster", he refers to the incident as he confesses to the headmaster that "I've been with those naughty little girls again, now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame."
The lyrics in this track reference a moment in Ray Davies's brother and bandmate, Dave youth. Davies was very rebellious, (the polar opposite of his introspective brother, Ray), and he often got into trouble. One time, as a fifteen year old, Davies was expelled from school after he was discovered having intercourse with Sue Sheehan, his girlfriend at the time. on Hampstead Heath. The two were promptly separated by their families when Sue discovered she was pregnant. This event influenced Davies, as well as his songwriting. Songs such as "Funny Face", "Susannah's Still Alive", and "Mindless Child of Motherhood" were related to this event.
Release and Reception.
"I'm in Disgrace" was the debut single from "Schoolboys in Disgrace" in America, where it was backed with "The Hard Way", a popular live track from the same album. It was, like many Kinks singles of this time period, unpopular, as it did not make a mark in the charts.
Despite its poor commercial showing, the track is often mentioned as one of the best tracks from "Schoolboys in Disgrace". Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone said that "'I'm in Disgrace' is a terrific rock & roll song about erotic confusion and shame." AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited the track as a highlight from the album.

The 4751st Air Defense Missile Squadron is an discontinued United States Air Force unit. It was last active with Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. It was inactivated on 30 September 1979.
History.
In September 1958 Air Research and Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc long range surface-to-air missile program from its testing site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on Santa Rosa Island, immediately south of Eglin AFB on the Gulf of Mexico. At Eglin, an Operational Testing facility and Operational Training Unit would be created under the jurisdiction of Air Defense Command, under which operational Bomarc units would be established and supported.
To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, ADC established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.
The training program used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin.
The last Bomarc missile squadron inactivated on 31 October 1972. The squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1979.
The Bomarc site is located on Santa Rosa Island is at

Harry Robson

Henry 'Harry' Robson (1 August 1904 – 31 August 1968) was an English cricketer. Robson was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Perkinsville, County Durham.
Robson qualified to play for Northumberland through his residence in the county, making his debut for it against Durham in the 1932 Minor Counties Championship. Before World War II, Robson made 65 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. Playing minor counties cricket for Northumberland allowed Robson to be selected to play for a representative Minor Counties cricket team, making a single first-class appearance for the team against the touring West Indians at Lord's in 1939. The West Indians won the toss and elected to bat first, making 370 all out, with Robson taking the wickets of Vic Stollmeyer, Jeff Stollmeyer, Gerry Gomez and Foffie Williams, to finish with figures of 4/80 from sixteen overs, which were also the best bowling figures in the innings. The Minor Counties then made 306 all out in their first-innings, with Robson the last man out when he was dismissed for 3 runs by Rolph Grant. The West Indians then reached 138/4 in their second-innings, in which Robson bowled nine wicketless overs for the cost of 44 runs, with the match declared a draw at this point.
After World War II, Robson returned to playing minor counties cricket for Northumberland, making an additional 24 appearances in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against the Yorkshire Second XI in 1949. Described by "Wisden" as "one of the best spin bowlers ever produced by the North East of England", he took over 300 wickets for Northumberland, with his most successful season coming in 1939 when he took 48 wickets at an average of 19.31. He also played cricket in the Lancashire League for Haslingden. Outside of cricket, he worked as a plumber. He died at Chester-le-Street, County Durham, on 31 August 1968.

Oswald Hussein

Oswald ("Ossie") Hussein is a Lokono (Arawak) artist from Guyana. Though he occasionally works in other mediums, he is best known for his wooden sculptures which explore various dimensions of Arawak Amerindian culture and tradition. Hussein first achieved national recognition when he won first prize in Guyana's National Exhibition of the Visual Arts in 1989, and since that time he has gone on to become one of Guyana's most celebrated artists and a leading figure in Guyanese sculpture. Along with his half-brother, George Simon, he is one of the most prominent members of the Lokono Artists Group. His work has been displayed in numerous exhibitions in Guyana, Barbados, and the United Kingdom.
Life.
Oswald Hussein was born in St. Cuthbert's Mission (Arawak: Pakuri) in British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1954.
Hussein first started working in wood carving and sculpture in the 1960s. In 1988, he joined an art and design workshop in St. Cuthbert's that was founded and led by his half-brother George Simon when the latter returned to Guyana after studying art in the UK. The workshop in St. Cuthbert's enabled a number of local artists, including Hussein, to develop their skills; and as the national reputation of these artists grew, they came to be known as the Lokono Artists' group. 
Hussein's involvement in the Lokono Artists Group and the St. Cuthbert's workshop marked the beginning of his rise to national, and later international success. In 1989 he won first prize in Guyana's National Exhibition of the Visual Arts with his sculpture "Massasekeree"; and in 1993 he repeated this achievement when he won first prize again for this sculpture "Wepelly". In 1991, Hussein's work was displayed at the Hadfield foundation as part of an exhibition called "Contemporary Amerindian Art", which showcased the work of nine members of the Lokono Artists Group. After another group exhibition in 1998 entitled "Six Lokono Artists", the Venezuelan Cultural Centre in Georgetown hosted the first solo exhibition of Hussein's work in 1999, entitled "Sunset Birds". This was closely followed by "Sunset Birds II" - an exhibition dedicated to Hussein and fellow Lokono artist, Roaland Taylor, at the National Art Gallery in Castellani House in 2000.
In 2006, Hussein was offered the position of artist-in-residence at the Horniman Museum in London. The residency was initially planned to begin in August of that year, but Hussein had to delay his journey after he was badly injured in a motorbike accident shortly before he was due to leave the UK. During his residency at the Horniman Museum, Hussein took part in an art exhibition called "Amazon to Caribbean: Early Peoples of the Rainforest", which was curated by Hassan Arero.
Art.
As a sculptor, Hussein's artistic method and style have varied and developed over the years. His sculptures always begin from a section of tree-trunk, and can take anything from one day to four months to complete. Critics have remarked upon substantial stylistic differences between his early and later works. While his early sculptures are predominantly large-scale pieces that are balanced between horizontal and vertical planes, his later works are noticeably smaller and most often vertically oriented. 
Conceptually, Hussein draws inspiration from his native Arawak cultural traditions. In an interview from 2006, he explained that a number of his sculptures were based upon stories that his mother told him when he was young, about "animals, humming birds or fish [...] and the sun and rain gods which mark events in our lives".
Notable Works.
"Oriyu Banka" (1995).
"Oriyu Banka" is a wooden sculpture that was created by Hussein in 1995. The sculpture is made of saman wood, and measures approximately 70 by 25.5 centimetres. It is a long, rounded sculpture that is covered with bold, geometric patterns, the most prominent of which are the circular, eye-like designs in the centre of the piece and the twelve sharp, curved "teeth" that protrude from its sides. The Arawakan title of the work translates as "Bench of the Water Spirit", with "Oriyu" being the name of a well-known female water-spirit in Arawak and other Amerindian mythologies. Critics Anne Walmsley and Stanley Greaves note that while the sculpture's shape and title are suggestive of a traditional bench, its sharp teeth and caiman-like appearance "would defy any human to sit on it".

Eswarah

Eswarah (foaled 21 April 2002) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the 2005 Epsom Oaks. In a racing career which lasted from April to August 2005 the filly ran five times times and won three races. Unraced as a two-year-old, Eswarah won her first three races as a three-year-old culminating with a win in the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. In her two subsequent appearances she finished eighth in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and fourth in the Yorkshire Oaks.
Background.
Eswarah is a bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg, bred by her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. Her sire, Unfuwain was a high-class middle distance runner who won four Group races before siring the winners of more than five hundred winners at stud. He was particularly successful with fillies: his daughters included Lahan (1,000 Guineas Stakes), Petrushka (Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks, Prix de l'Opera), Lailani (Irish Oaks, Nassau Stakes, Flower Bowl Invitational Handicap), Zahrat Dubai (Nassau Stakes) and Bolas (Irish Oaks). Eswarah's dam Midway Lady was a successful racemare, winning the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks in 1986 before producing several winners at stud.
Eswarah was originally sent to be trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Ben Hanbury, who had trained Midway Lady, but when Hanbury retired at the end of 2004, the filly, who had yet to race, was moved to the stables of Michael Jarvis. Eswarah, whose name is Arabic for "bracelet" was ridden in all of her races by Richard Hills.
Racing career.
Eswarah made her first appearance in a ten furlong maiden race at Newbury in April 2005. Starting the 5/2 favourite against fifteen other fillies, Eswarah took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from Alumni. Four weeks later, Eswarah was moved up to Listed class for the Fillies' Trial Stakes over the same course and distance. Starting at odds of 1/2, Eswarah went clear of the field in the straight and won very easily by two lengths.
On 3 June Eswarah started 11/4 joint favourite for the Oaks at Epsom, level in the betting with the 1000 Guineas winner Virginia Waters, despite being the least experienced and "about the smallest". Richard Hills settled the filly on the outside of the field of twelve runners and turned into the straight in fifth place. Hills explained that he kept the inexperienced filly well away from the inside rail to avoid and bumping or interference. Eswarah moved into the lead two furlongs from the finish and was driven out by Hills to win by one and a half lengths from the David Elsworth-trained Something Exciting. There was a gap of three lengths to Pictavia, who beat Virginia Waters by a length for third. The win was a second classic of Michael Jarvis's long career following Ameerat's success in the 2001 1000 Guineas. After the race he described Eswarah as an exceptional filly and named the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks as likely future targets.
Eswarah was then given a break of seven weeks before returning in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Her connections cited the filly's improving form and the generous weight-for-age concessions she would receive from her opponents as the main reasons for decision to run. As Ascot Racecourse was being redeveloped, the 2005 King George was run at Newbury Racecourse and Eswarah was the only three-year-old in the twelve runner field starting at odds of 9/1. After looking to be going well early in the straight, Eswarah weakened in the closing stages and finished eighth behind Azamour, beaten eighteen lengths. In the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August, Eswarah led briefly a furlong from the finish but faded into fourth place behind the four-year-old Punctilious. After this disappointing performance x-ray examinations revealed a bone chip in the filly's knee and her retirement from racing was announced in September. Jarvis commented that despite Eswarah's win in the Oaks, which he described as "the highlight of my career", the filly had never been suited by the firm ground which had prevailed that summer.
Assessment and honours.
In the 2005 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Eswarah was given a rating of 115, making her the equal sixth best three-year-old filly in the world seven pounds below Divine Proportions.
The filly received an unusual honour when property developers named a new housing estate in Epsom "Eswarah House".
Stud record.
Eswarah was retired to become a broodmare for the Shadwell Stud. Her progeny include Firdaws, a filly sired by Kingmambo, who won one race and finished third in the Group One Fillies' Mile in 2011.
2007 Sheklaan (USA) : Bay colt, foaled 22 February, by Kingmambo (USA) - unplaced in five races in England and Dubai 2010/11
2008
2009 Firdaws (USA) : Bay filly, 26 February, by Mr Greeley (USA) - won 1 race and 3rd G1 Fillies' Mile, Newmarket in England 2011-12
2010 Qawaafy (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 1 March, by Street Cry (IRE) - won 1 race and placed 2nd three times from seven starts in England 2012/13

Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights

A Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights took effect in New York State on November 29, 2010. Among other rights, this law gave domestic workers the right to overtime pay, a day of rest every seven days, three paid days of rest each year (after one year of work for the same employer), protection under the state human rights law, and a special cause of action for domestic workers who suffer sexual or racial harassment. In July 2013, Hawaii became the second state to implement basic labor protections for domestic workers. In January 2014, similar legislation took effect in California.
Background.
The National Labor Relations Act was enacted in 1935 by Congress. This law was created to protect the rights of workers in the United States. The act did not cover domestic workers, as well as a number of other employees.
Therefore, a six year grassroots campaign was put into effect until the Governor of New York passed the Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights.
New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights.
Under the New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, a domestic worker is defined as someone who works in another person's home who is not related to them and is not a part-time job. This bill gives domestic workers an eight hour work day and overtime (time and a half) for working over 40 hours a week (or 44 hours if the employee resides in the home of their employer). This law also establishes that workers must be granted one day (24 hours) off every seven days of work or be paid overtime pay if the employee agrees to work on this day. Also, after one year of work with the same employer, domestic workers are granted three paid days off every year. Although domestic workers were already covered by the minimum wage law, this bill ensures that domestic workers receive $7.25 per hour. Employers must pay their workers weekly and cannot deduct money from the employee's paycheck without written permission. Employers must now keep a payroll and provide workers with written notifications regarding sick days, vacation days, and work schedules. Domestic workers who work at least 40 hours a week are now entitled to Workers' Compensation Insurance and Disability Benefits. This law also gives domestic workers coverage under the New York State Human Rights Law if they have been harassed due to gender, race, sex, religion, or origin. The employer cannot make any unwanted sexual advances including both physical and verbal sexual actions. If the worker files a complaint, the employer cannot retaliate. This law covers all full-time workers, including immigrants. This law does not cover people who are related to the person they care for, or if they are a part-time worker, such as a baby-sitter.
Hawaii Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights.
Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie signed a domestic workers bill of rights in July 2013, making Hawaii the second U.S. state to give nannies, housekeepers and others protections on wages and other labor issues. The domestic workers bill in Hawaii makes it illegal to discriminate against domestic workers based on several factors, including race, gender and sexual orientation. It also establishes protections, overtime, rest breaks, and protection from abuse and harassment for them. It covers cooks, waiters, butlers and others, including some baby sitters; it went into effect immediately.
California Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights.
California had an ongoing debate about passing a Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. The 2012 California bill, which was inspired by the New York Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, would have entitled domestic workers to overtime pay, eased eligibility requirements for workers' compensation, and provided them with meal and rest breaks, the right to eight hours of sleep, and the right to use their employers’ kitchens to cook their own food.
That bill passed the state Senate and the concurrence vote in the Assembly, but California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed it on September 30, 2012.
However, the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights (AB 241) was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown on September 26, 2013, and went into effect on January 1, 2014. The law makes nannies, private healthcare aides and other domestic workers in California eligible for overtime pay if they work more than nine hours a day or 45 hours a week.

Lewchuk

The Surname Lewchuk is of Ukrainian origin. It is composed of the root word "Lew" (Sometimes spelled "Lev") meaning 'Lion', and the Ukrainian diminutive suffix "Chuk" or "uk" meaning "son of" or "descendant of”. Thus, the surname Lewchuk can be interpreted as "son or descendant of Lew". Note: the Ukrainian diminutive suffix "Chuk" or "uk" meaning "son of" or "descendant of" is a very common way of composing Ukrainian surnames.

(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman

(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman is a song written by Ray Davies that was first released on The Kinks' 1979 album, "Low Budget".
About.
The song was inspired by Ray Davies watching "" in late 1978. The song also invokes another movie from the era, "Saturday Night Fever", and the 1960s Animals hit "We Got to Get Out of This Place." The lyrics describe an average person dreaming of being Superman in order to get through social issues. The lyrics combine "fantasy" and "mundanity," two of Davies' favorite themes. Author Thomas Kitts notes the irony in the lyrics sung by a weakling wishing he were Superman which, as with other songs Davies wrote, leads to the singer feeling resigned. Author Nick Hasted makes a similar point, that despite dreaming of being Superman, the singer remains Clark Kent and can't get over his fear of the bad news he keeps hearing. According to Allmusic critic Richard Gilliam, its lyrics are among "Ray Davies' most sharp-edged." It has a disco-like sound, though a hard rock version is sometimes performed in concert. Critic Johnny Rogan describes the lyrics as "witty" and the music as "upbeat." Music critic Robert Christgau describes it as a "fusion of syndrum and macho-flash guitar."
Release and Reception.
"Billboard Magazine" rated it one of the top tracks from "Low Budget". Music producer Clive Davis described the song as tapping "the malaise at the tail end of the decade." Ray Davies has said that the song was written as a joke in response to a request by Davis, who was then running Arista Records, for a "club-friendly record." It was released as the lead single from "Low Budget", and it reached #41 in the U.S. charts. It is also the only single from the album to be released in both Britain and America.
It also appeared in live form on the album "One for the Road". Allmusic critic Bret Adams called this live version a "raw, stripped-down" rendition.

Terrantez

Terrantez (also known as "Cascal") is a white Portuguese wine grape variety that was once widely used on the island of Madeira to make the sweet fortified wine for which the island is known. Today, the variety is nearly extinct on the island. There are still some limited plantings in the Minho Province where, as "Cascal", is a permitted blending variety with Alvarinho and other grapes in the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) wine Vinho Verde. As "Terrantez" the grape is permitted in several of the " Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada" (IPR) regions of the Azores including Biscoitos IPR on Terceira Island, Graciosa IPR on the white island of Graciosa and Pico IPR on Pico Island. 
Regions.
Terrantez is a low yielding vine that is most widely associated with the wines of Madeira though its use in the wine and presence on the island has been slowly fading. Some plantings of the variety can still be found in the Azores, the Portuguese island chain located northwest of Madeira in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. There is also some plantings of in the Minho province on the Portuguese mainland though ampelographer Paul Truel has speculated that the mainland variety (known most often as "Cascal") may actually be a different variety, though this has not be conclusively determined.
Wine styles.
Terrantez has the potential to make rich full-bodied wines with highly perfumed bouquet. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, in older bottles of Madeira Terrantez has shown an ability to age well in developing wines with long finishes and layers of complexity.
Synonyms and other varieties.
In addition to Cascal, Terrantez has been known under a variety of a synonyms including: Morrao, Murrao, Pe de Perdiz, Pe de Perdrix, Pied de Perdix and Terrantes.
Several other white Portuguese grape varieties share synonyms with Terrantez and may be related though there is not yet any conclusive evidence. These include Folgasao which has the synonyms of "Terrantez da Madeira" and "Terrantez de Madere" and Donzelinho Branco which has the synonym of "Terrantez" and "Terrantes". 
The Portuguese red grape Alicante Bouschet also shares the "Pe de Perdiz" synonym with Terrantez and the French/Argentine grape Malbec is also known as "Pied de Perdix".

<doc id="36739680" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36739680" title="Air Defense, Tactical Air Command">
Air Defense, Tactical Air Command

Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC) is an inactive unit of the United States Air Force, last stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. It was last assigned to Tactical Air Command, and was inactivated on 6 December 1985.
It was a command and control organization responsible for the air defense of the United States.
ADTAC was established when the Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) was inactivated as a Major Command on 1 October 1979. Aerospace Defense Command's atmospheric defense resources (interceptors, warning radars, and associated bases and personnel) were subsequently transferred to ADTAC. The command was, essentially, a transition organization between the Aerospace Defense Command, and the transfer of the air defense mission from the USAF to the Air National Guard in 1990.
Overview.
ADTAC was a Named Unit of the USAF, and operated at the Numbered Air Force echelon of TAC. It consisted of over 25,000 military and civilian personnel performing duty at radar sites, missile warning stations, fighter interceptor bases, satellite tracking centers, and command and control centers throughout the world.
The command had the responsibility to provide operationally ready interceptor aircraft and aircrews for air defense alert 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. These assets had to be capable of scrambling to identify and assist or engage unidentified or hostile airborne objects approaching or entering United States airspace without proper approval. These scrambles were initiated from the respective region headquarters based on information derived from radar site data and previously known or expected airborne traffic. During increased states of readiness, these same ADTAC assets would provide additional air defense forces to CINCNORAD to provide early warning information, attack assessment, and air defense of North America. During peacetime operations, the mission of ADTAC was to command, train, manage, and evaluate forces required for the above mentioned air defense contingencies. In doing so, the tasks of preparing budget proposals, acquiring equipment, and providing support requirements, were essential to providing ready air defense forces. An important related function that ADTAC was tasked to perform was providing day-to-day support for Air Forces Iceland to maintain air defense assets available to protect that island nation. These assets were under operational control of the Commander in Chief Atlantic, just as CINCNORAD maintained operational control of ADTAC air defense assets.
Realignments.
HQ ADTAC remained at Peterson AFB, Colorado to direct the transition into TAC, which was eventually moved to Langley AFB in July 1981. In essence, Tactical Air Command became the old Continental Air Command (ConAC), of which, TAC and Air Defense Command were part of during the postwar years.
In 1979 there were fewer than 100 long-range aircraft detection radars covering the United States, Alaska, Canada, and Iceland, The old SAGE (Semi Automatic Ground Environment) System with its 1950 vintage computers and radar sites, was being replaced by the JSS (Joint Surveillance System) in 1983 using modern technology computer technology and joint-use (Federal Aviation Agency and Air Force) radar sites. The Joint Surveillance System would consist of radars, Regional Operations Control Centers (ROCCs), and communications and support facilities. The ROCCs would be phased in to replace the SAGE blockhouses as command and control centers. The old SAGE system was designed for both peacetime and wartime functions. The JSS/ROCC system was designed primarily for peacetime, or until the tactical situation required transfer of control to an E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) designated for air defense. The six continental U.S. SAGE centers were to be replaced by four ROCCs. Two additional ROCCs were planned, one by the Canadians for the defense of Canada, and one for Alaska. The 552d Airborne Warning and Control Wing, located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, was part of Tactical Air Command and supplied E-3A AWACS aircraft for strategic air defense purposes.
Interceptor aircraft transferred to ADTAC during the reorganization consisted of F-101 Voodoo, F-106 Delta Dart, and F-4 Phantom II fighters. The F-101 was the oldest and was possessed by three Air National Guard units, plus the Air Defense Weapons Center at Tyndall AFB. The F-101s at Tyndall were used mainly as simulated target aircraft employing electronic counter measures (ECM) and for towing targets for testing and training. Due to its age and problems in supporting the F-101, it was soon deleted from the inventory. By the fall of 1982, all F-101s, including those at Tyndall, had been retired; and, except for those at Tyndall, had been replaced by the F-4 Phantom II. The F-4 and F-106 remained in the interceptor inventory. The F-4 was possessed by Air National Guard squadrons and the 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron in Iceland. The F-106 was possessed by Air Force and Air Guard squadrons. Modification of the F-106 through the years had improved its fire control system in an attempt to keep it up-to-date, but did not update its armament except for the addition of a gun. TAC planned the eventual conversion of all the Air Force F-106 squadrons to the F-15 Eagle and F-4 units to the F-16 Fighting Falcon Air Defense Fighter (ADF) variant. The two squadrons of EB-57 Canberra aircraft transferred to ADTAC were retired from the inventory by 1983. These aircraft were previously used for target training missions and electronic countermeasure training.
Both active-duty and Air National Guard squadrons under state control were administratively assigned to TAC though their state ANG control for the air defense mission. On 9 December 1985 these ADTAC Air Division units were placed under the newly activated First Air Force at Langley AFB, VA, which later moved to Tyndall AFB, FL in 1991. This arrangement remained in effect until the last F-106 was retired by the 177th FIG of the New Jersey Air National Guard and all Regular Air Force and ANG F-101 and F-106 units had transitioned to either the F-4, the F-15 or the F-16.
The Air Defense Weapons Center at Tyndall AFB, Florida was reorganized and a new organization was activated, the 325th Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW). The 325th FWW, through its subordinate units, conducted an extensive training program for air defense aircrews and weapons controllers; the USAF Interceptor Weapons School (IWS) trained instructors in all phases of interceptor weapons systems and employment. F-106 training was conducted by the 2d Fighter Interceptor Training Squadron (FITS). This unit was re-designated the 2d Fighter Weapons Squadron (FWS) on 1 February 1982. The 2nd FWS's mission continued to be F-106 training with plans to convert to the F-15 Eagle starting in the fall of 1983. All continental USAF sub-scale and full-scale drone aerial target operations were consolidated in the 82d Tactical Aerial Targets Squadron (TATS). The Weapons Center's drone facilities, proximity to the Gulf of Mexico air-to-air gunnery ranges, and experienced personnel, made it compatible with many of TAC's training programs.
Transfer to Air National Guard.
The 20th and 21st Air Divisions were inactivated on 1 March and 23 September 1983 and their assets merged into other Air Divisions. On 6 December 1985 First Air Force was re-activated by TAC and assumed the assets of ADTAC, which was inactivated.
The Air Defense Sectors were transferred by the Air Force to the National Guard Bureau and allotted to the Air National Guard on 1 October 1990. They were operationally gained by First Air Force, Tactical Air Command.
First Air Force was transferred to Air Combat Command along with the rest of TAC on 1 June 1992

Michael Wendler

Michael Wendler (born 22 June 1972 in Dinslaken as Michael Skowronek, since his marriage in 2009 Michael Norberg) is a German singer of "Schlager" songs. Im September 2008 Wendler received a Gold album for 100,000 sales of his album "Best Of - Vol.1".
Life.
In Germany Wendler is famous as a singer of "Schlager" songs. Wendler in 2007 filled the Oberhausen Arena with an audience of 12,000 for the third year in succession.
Controversy.
In the course of several legal incidents Michael Wendler has been criticized in the German tabloid press. In 1998 Michael Wendler took out an injunction against Frank Wendler, who possessed the rights to the name "Der Wendler" ("The Wendler") not to use that name on stage. The court decided both may use the name "Der Wendler", since there is no risk of confusing both artists. In 2002 German prosecution investigated Michael Wendler for fraud. In 2012 he was sued by two women who previously had paid him 40,000 Euros for being allowed to open a Wendler themed café. The issue was around the question what the payment specifically allowed them and the women also had a problem with additional 100,000 Euros Wendler wanted after the initial deal. On September 29, 2012 he was charged to return the 40,000 Euros, which he appealed. In 2013 a TV show about the case was made in which he was persuaded to return the money. He returned the money in cash on camera.

Catch Me Now I'm Falling

Catch Me Now I'm Falling is a song written by Ray Davies and first released by The Kinks as the second track on their 1979 album "Low Budget".
About.
Like many of the other tracks on "Low Budget", "Catch Me Now I'm Falling" addresses then-current events. In this case the song shows lead singer Ray Davies portraying America in its time of need, with the lyrics criticizing both the U.S. and its allies that refuse to help it. Author Nick Hasted describes it as sounding as if "it could be a distress call from the last embattled radio station in an occupied land." Hasted also notes that it invoked memories of the United States' to Europe via the Marshall Plan to criticize countries that were not helping the country in its time of need. While another song on "Low Budget" invokes DC Comics hero Superman, "Catch Me Now I'm Falling" calls to Marvel Comics hero Captain America. The riff is similar to those on The Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "Jumpin' Jack Flash." The song includes a saxophone solo that "Billboard Magazine" described as "hot," as well as a guitar solo by Dave Davies. 
Release and Reception.
The song was one of two U.S. only singles taken from Low Budget (the other being "A Gallon of Gas") to be released. It also appeared on the compilation album "Come Dancing with The Kinks" and in live form on the album "One for the Road".
Hasted praises "Catch Me Now I'm Falling" for perfecting summing up the mood in the United States at the time "with a brilliant broad stroke." Music producer Clive Davis described the song as tapping "the malaise at the tail end of the decade." Music critic Johnny Rogan described the song as being "perfect" for live stadium shows. "Billboard Magazine" described the song as "sweeping" and "destined to become a favorite with fans" and rated it one of the top tracks from "Low Budget". Author Bob Cianci described it as an "FM radio hit." But music critic Robert Christgau criticizes the song for lacking irony. "Rolling Stone Album Guide" critic Rob Sheffield calls it an "embarrassing novelty."

State of Confusion (song)

"State of Confusion" is a song written by Ray Davies and first released by The Kinks as the title track of their 1983 album "State of Confusion". Although it was not released as a single in the United States, it reached #26 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was released as a single in Continental Europe. 
Lyrics and music.
The lyrics of "State of Confusion" depict numerous of sources of frustration to the singer. Among these are technological failures, such as a television that's "on the blink," a clothes dryer that doesn't work and a video machine that breaks down. In addition, there are more domestic problems as the basement is flooded, the attic has woodworm and the ceiling has collapsed. To make matters worse, when the video machine breaks, the singer's girlfriend gets bored and leaves him. Later in the song, the singer is frustrated by trying to cross the street amidst traffic. The song ends with the singer unable to sleep due to financial worries and concluding that there is "no escape" from the world's "state of confusion." If anything, things get worse as you age.
Musically, the music opens with Dave Davies playing guitar chords, onto which Ian Gibbons layers on keyboard part which Ray Davies's biographer Thomas Kitts describes as "thin" and "haunting." Dave Davies then starts playing the guitar riff, described by Kitts as "belligerent," after which Ray Davies lets out a "tormented" scream, before beginning to sing the lyrics of the song. The song's guitar riff is an extension of the riffs played by Dave Davies back to the earliest Kinks' hits, "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night."
One theme of the song is the way technology can overwhelm human emotion. Kitts suggests that the word "state" in the song and in the title represents multiple meanings – a psychic state of confusion, as well as the state as the government promoting consumer consumption, as well as the state of popular music which traps the singer, particularly in the video. Music critic Johnny Rogan finds the song a continuation of Davies' "misfit persona" from earlier songs.
Music video.
The Kinks shot a music video for MTV to support the song. The video depicts Ray Davies facing sources of frustration both at home and in the recording studio. Some of the sources of frustration in the video are different than those depicted in the song lyrics, such as difficulty using a computer and a razor at home, and difficulties with cue cards and a guitar strap in the studio. The video does not depict the girlfriend who moves out, but does show Davies struggling to cross the street. The video ends on a more triumphant note than the song lyrics: after Davies emerges from his dressing room for a performance, he leaps on stage with legs outstretched and the video ends with a freeze frame at the top of the leap. The energetic ending suggests transcending the earlier frustrations, perhaps as a result of the creative act of artistic performance.
Recording.
"State of Confusion" was recorded at Konk Studios in Hornsey in March of 1983, late in the recording process for the album. The song replaced the original intended title track of the album, "Entertainment."
Critical reception.
Music critic Johnny Rogan considers "State of Confusion" a "fist-thrusting anthem," finding the singer's mishaps and the chaos he faces "amusing." Music critic Pete Bishop considers the song "solid rock with some dance beat." Author Rob Jovanic claims that it "dashes along with the best pop-rockers of the era, such as "Footloose."
Other appearances.
After its initial release on "State of Confusion", "State of Confusion" has appeared on a few Kinks compilation albums. It appeared on the 1996 US version of "To the Bone", but not on the 1994 UK version.

Sitting in My Hotel

"Sitting in My Hotel" is a song written by Ray Davies that was first released on The Kinks' 1972 album "Everybody's in Show-Biz". It was also released on several compilation albums and as the B-side of the "Sweet Lady Genevieve" single. It is one of Davies' more introspective song, musing about the cost of fame and stardom, and thus contributes to the album's theme of the difficulties of life on the road.
Lyrics and music.
The theme of "Sitting in My Hotel" is the loneliness produced by stardom. According to Davies, the key line in the song is the oft repeated line "if my friends could see me now." Davies wonders in the song what his old friends would think of him and his life now that he is wealthy and famous. The lyrics suggest that now that he is wealthy and famous, he has lost some of his identity, particularly his link to his working class roots. Davies comments on his outlandish stage costumes and performance style, referring to himself as an "outrageous poove," and notes his attempts to avoid responsibility. He also questions whether his work is meaningful, from both a cultural and personal perspective. The cultural perspective is referred to in the line about "writing songs for old time vaudeville reviews," which has a particularly personal resonance given the criticism Davies and the Kinks received for performing music hall songs instead of the rock songs fans and critics expected. The personal perspective is reflected in the question which ends the song, asking "what's it all leading to?" 
Davies has stated about the song that "We had all the trappings of that success around us, but there I was, in the middle of it all, asking the question 'Who am I?' I was really concerned about who I was. So the hotel was just a symbol for my isolation. The song ought to be subtitled 'Who am I trying to kid?'" The song doesn't only reflect Ray Davies' feelings, but those of the other band members as well. Kinks guitarist Dave Davies has stated that "it doesn't amatter how luxurious your surroundings are, you go back to your hotel room and it is like a prison. We used to do 11, 12, 13 month tours of America and leave our families at home because we couldn't afford to bring them over. It was hell."
The primary instrumentation is John Gosling's piano. Gosling also plays Hammond organ. Other instruments include Ray Davies on acoustic guitar, Dave Davies on electric guitar, John Dalton on bass guitar, Mick Avory on drums and Mike Cotton on trumpet. Ray Davies sings the lead vocal with Dave Davies providing backup vocals. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the melody as "charming," and "Rolling Stone Magazine" critic Bob Palmer describes it as "beautiful."
Reception.
Music critic Johnny Rogan regards "Sitting in My Hotel" one of the two or three indispensable songs on "Everybody's in Show-Biz", describing the lyrics as "thoughtful," "self-deprecating" and "self-analytical." "Rolling Stone Magazine" critic Bob Palmer calls the song "a bonafide Kinks Klassic, dreamily wistful with a beautiful melody and featuring 'the exquisite Mr. John Gosling at the pianoforte.'" Ole Jacob Hoel of "Adresseavisen" described it and "Celluloid Heroes," also from "Everybody's in Show-Biz" as "two of history's finest pop songs." However, music critic John Mendelsohn finds a note of self-pity in Davies singing about "how used he feels." Kinks' pianist Gosling considers "Sitting in My Hotel" to be "really good," despite not being as impressed with most of the songs on "Everybody's in Show-Biz".
Other appearances.
Subsequent to its initial appearance on "Everybody's in Show-Biz", "Sitting in My Hotel" was included on several Kinks' compilation albums, including "The Kinks' Greatest: Celluloid Heroes" and "Picture Book". In 1973 it was released as the B-side of the Kinks' single "Sweet Lady Genevieve" in Europe.

Astras

Astras (Greek: Αστράς) is a small mountain village of Elis, West Greece, Greece and belongs according to recent local government reform, with the name Callicrates, since 1/1/2011 to the municipal unit of Lampeia, along with Lampeia and Oreini .Municipal unit of Lampeia belongs to the municipality of Ancient Olympia . In the years 1997-2010 according to another local government plan, with the name Kapodistrias, the village used to belong to the former Municipality of Lampeia, as the capital of the former municipal unit of Astras. Near the village in a lower altitude there is a settlement named Kaluvia of Astras. A mountain road which goes through a forest with breathtaking landscapes connects Astras with the capital of the municipal unit of Lampeia, the village of Lampeia or Divri.
Population.
According to the census of 2001 the former municipal unit of Astras had 407 inhabitants whilst the village itself had 196.
The first recorded census was held in 1700 by Francisco Grimani from Venice. The village had 174 inhabitants and in detail 34 families (92 men and 82 women).
History.
The region of Astras is inhabited from the ancient years as a few kilometers away in the nearby village of Tripotama there was the ancient city of Psophis which is mentioned even in Iliad. In particular Astras in ancient time was a part of Ancient Psofis, a big city-state of Western Peloponnese, and actually some sculptures and other things of daily use of this time were found in the modern settlement of Kaluvia of Astras. Astras history though begins mostly in the Byzantine years. A significant fact happened in the proto Byzantine years when Alaric the Great destroyed Ancient Psofis in 398 A.C. In fact the historian Zosimus who wrote about the area 50 years after the destruction of the city of Psofis informs us that few of the citizens returned to the destroyed cities and that the signs of the destruction were significant. The most significant fact though of the village itself is the “Asketerion of Nousa” (Nousa is the old name of Astras). After the fall of the Byzantine Empire the village became part of the Republic of Venice. Astras or Nousa (the name of the village that time) belonged to the teritorium of Kalavryta and in 1700 the census of Grimani took place. According to this census the 174 inhabitants of the village place Nousa in the high populated villages of the region. During the Ottoman Occupation the villagers suffered a lot from Ottoman rule and especially from the Bay of Lala, a close big city in the Ottoman times .Thus The Nousaites, that is how are called even today the villagers, became klephts, fighters who use to spend their life in the mountain seeking for freedom. Many heroes of the Greek revolution were from Nousa. According to the National Library of Greece some of the Nousa’s characters in the Greek struggle for freedom were Nikolaos Koulis, Chrysanthos Koulis, Demetrius Karachioutis, Konstantinos Stathopoulos, Vasileios Makris, Aggellis Makris and the weelknown Panagiotes Makris (Makropanagos) . The last was a relative of the famous Giannias who became the terror of the Turkalbanians of a big region containing villages of Patrai .After the liberation and the constitution of the first free Greek state, Nousa became part of Municipality of Lampeia.
Today.
Today the village of Astras still claims to be a living village despite the fact of being surrounded by big mountains .The village retains the traditional character of the whole region. There is a fest in the village for Saint George who is considered to be the protector of the village .The majority of the villagers of Astras is activated in the domain of agriculture. The village in the summer time has some ecotourists who admire the natural beauty of the forest and also of the river that goes through the village .It is the river of Erymanthos where Hercules is said to have captured the Erymnanhtian boar.
The Asketerion.
The Asketerion of Astras is a two floor building which was built inside the mountain in a big rock. In the left of the entrance there is a ladder made of the rock which leads to the upper floor where there is a small chapel which nice with the most significant picture being the one with Virgin Mary (Platytera). Near the Asketerion there is the ruins of the old church of Saint John. The building of Asketerion was made by Osios Meletios in the 9th century, who had established many Monasteries in the region of Astras and in other neighboring regions.
Astras, the poem.
In 1930 Theodoros Ksudis from Elia wrote a poem with the name Astras:
Greek:
βαθιά θεμελιωμένε,
ωραίε κι αγριεμένε,
μέσ’ στα πυκνά σου ελάτια
σαν ουρανός με μάτια...
νεανικέ Αστρά μου,
και της χαράς χαρά μου.
που δένεται η ψυχή μου
κι εκστατική στιγμή μου!
English:
Astras, proud Astras
Strongly established
You who stand steadily
Beautiful and wild
You hide immortal souls
In your deep forests
And you show yourself to sky
Like a sky with eyes
Astras proud Astras
My young Astras
You are the youth of my youth
And the joy of my joy
With which relaxing prayer
My soul goes with
In my beautiful
Ecstatic moment of mine watching you

Linda Drane Burdick

Linda Drane Burdick is the Chief Assistant State Attorney at the Orange and Osceola County State Attorney's Office in Orlando, Florida. She was the lead prosecutor on the State of Florida vs. Casey Anthony case.
Background.
Linda Drane Burdick was born on October 12, 1964 in Lower Burrell, PA. She is the daughter of Marilyn Jacobs and Don Drane. She has one younger sister, Cindy. Linda Drane Burdick attended Lower Burrell High School where in addition to her studies, she participated in a variety of extra curricular activities including softball, gymnastics, the French club, Explorers, Junior Achievement, and the newspaper staff. When it came time for college, Burdick considered international relations or social science. Instead she earned her undergraduate degree in political science from the University of Pittsburgh, then graduated from its highly regarded School of Law in 1989. Drane Burdick currently resides in Orlando, Florida and has one daughter.
Career.
Linda Drane Burdick began work at the State Attorney's Office on October 10, 1989. She has prosecuted numerous high-profile felony cases.
In 2001, she won a conviction over Theodore Rodgers Jr., who on Valentine’s Day shot and killed his wife at a day care center because, he said, he believed she was having an affair with her ex-husband. Rodgers was sentenced to death. She successfully convicted Franklin Lee Reed in 2003 for the 1986 rape and murder of 13-year-old Mollie Pittman, a Lockhart Junior High school student. Pittman's body was found in a Needles Drive home on May 11, 1986—stabbed 12 times with an ice pick. In 2005, She obtained three life sentences for Brent Mackinder, who was convicted of raping his 7-year-old niece and then trying to kill her along West Orange Trail. Also in 2005, she prosecuted Derek Pelto, who killed his girlfriend by stabbing her and then striking her repeatedly with a hammer. Pelto was sentenced to life in prison.
She was the prosecutor in the 2005 case of the State of Florida vs. Clyde Blount. Blount shot and killed a 16-year-old who he said had been bullying his son. Blount was convicted of manslaughter. More recently, in 2008, Burdick prosecuted Aurlieas McClarty, who walked into an Orlando U-Haul, shot two employees dead and fled with $200. McClarty was sentenced to life in prison. She is most well-known for being the lead prosecutor on the State of Florida vs. Casey Marie Anthony in 2011 for the death of Caylee Anthony. Anthony was acquitted of the murder charges on July 5, 2011.
Those who have worked with Drane Burdick describe her as resilient, meticulous, driven, dogged and even a bit aloof. But, they add, a certain amount of emotional distance is to be expected from anyone who has remained sane after 23 years prosecuting alleged child abusers, sexual predators, murderers and rapists.
Drane Burdick was one of 23 candidates being considered to fill a vacant judicial seat in the Ninth Circuit Judicial Court in February 2012. Ultimately, she was not appointed to the position. In August 2012, State Attorney Elect, Jeff Ashton, named Drane Burdick as his Chief Assistant State Attorney.
Drane Burdick returned to the courtroom in November 2013 as lead prosecutor in the State of Florida vs. Jason Rodriguez. Rodriguez was accused of a mass shooting in an office complex in downtown Orlando, FL that left five people injured and one dead in November 2009. After days of complex testimony delving into the mind of a killer, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told jurors that the case against the Gateway Center shooter boiled down to one question alone: "Did Jason Rodriguez know it was wrong to kill people?" Less than 3 1/2 hours later, a 12-member jury returned its verdict: Rodriguez was guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of 26-year-old Otis Beckford, and five counts of attempted first-degree murder for wounding five other people Nov. 6, 2009.
Drane Burdick remains the Chief Assistant State Attorney under State Attorney Jeff Ashton.
Casey Anthony Trial.
The trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding. Linda Drane Burdick was the lead attorney for the state of Florida while Jeffrey Ashton and Frank George served as co-counsel. In the opening statements of the widely publicized trial, Linda Drane Burdick described the story of the disappearance of Caylee Anthony day-by-day. The state alleged an intentional murder and sought the death penalty against Casey Anthony. Prosecutors stated that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious before putting duct tape over her nose and mouth to suffocate her, and left Caylee's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. They painted Anthony as a party girl who killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibility and enjoy her personal life. Caylee Marie Anthony had been missing for 31 days before police were called. Four hundred pieces of evidence were presented and the trial lasted 33 days, concluding on July 4, 2011. On July 5, 2011, after deliberating 11 hours over the course of 2 days, the Pinellas County, Florida jury acquitted Casey Anthony of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, or aggravated child abuse. She was convicted on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer.

Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia

Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia is an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in Australia. It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by Melbourne University Press.
Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.
Background.
Academic fieldwork into Paganism.
Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her "Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today", which was first published by Viking Press in 1979. A second study was produced by the anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann in her "Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England" (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London. This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's "Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited" (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.
Hume and her research.
Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a religious pluralist and leading her to study the discipline of anthropology. Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a Unitarian church in Calgary, it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992. Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the Church of All Worlds and held in the rural outskirts of Canberra. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a neoshamanic meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a Vodou-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess Oya.
In preparation for "Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia", Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became "not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime." Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, Murdoch University and at the Theosophical Society in Brisbane. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a snowball sampling method.
Synopsis.
Chapter one, entitled "Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation. The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia. The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views, while the fourth examines the organization and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.
Chapter five offers an examination of rites of passage an the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca, while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in magic. The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms, and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality. In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.
Reviews.
Emma Tomalin of Lancaster University reviewed the work for "Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions". Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being "descriptive rather than discursive", thereby appealing more to those "interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice
than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications."

Christopher Evans (theologian)

The Reverend Professor Christopher Francis Evans FBA (7 November 1909 – 30 July 2012) was an English chaplain and theologian who became known as an authority on the New Testament. He also served as lecturer in Theology at Corpus Christi College at Oxford University from 1948 to 1958 and was later made an Emeritus Fellow.
Early life and education.
Born in Birmingham in 1909, Evans attended King Edward's School, renowned for its track record of producing theologians and Christian leaders, such as Edward Benson, once Archbishop of Canterbury. His classmates at the school at the time include the future Conservative MP Enoch Powell. After gaining a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he became influenced by Sir Edwyn Clement Hoskyns who encouraged emphasis on literary forms used in the Bible, including songs, proverbs and stories. He later spent a year being taught by Michael Ramsey, at Lincoln Theological College before serving four years in parochial ministry in Southampton.
Career in theology.
Evans returned to the college in Lincoln in 1938 as a member of the teaching staff. The institute struggled during World War II, with a reduction of pupil intakes, as well as interference of bombers in the nearby airspace. After six years at the college, he was offered a role by the Bishop of Lincoln at a teacher-training college in the chaplaincy, a role which he would fill for a term of four years.
In 1948, he was elected as both a fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he would soon become renowned for his tutoring in teachings of the New Testament beside the likes of J. R. Porter and Dennis Nineham. 
After a decade at Corpus, he was appointed to Lightfoot Professorship at Durham, but upon failing to settle in the city, he moved back south in 1962. For 15 years he taught as professor of New Testament studies at King's College London before retiring in 1977 to the village of Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire.
Personal life.
In 1941, Evans married Elna Pasco. The couple remained together until Elna's death in 1980 had one son, Jonathan, who later followed his father into holy orders. 
Evans struggled to come to terms with the death of his wife, despite living for a further 32 years. At the age of 98, Evans was asked about his age over a pub lunch, where he was quoted to have responded "Part of you feels that you shouldn't be here.". He celebrated his 100th birthday at the Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009.
Evans died on 30 July 2012, at the age of 102 and was survived by his son.

John Hammond (died 1589)

John Hammond (1542 – 1589) was an English civil lawyer and politician.
He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Rye in 1584 and West Looe in 1586.
Life.
His mother was a sister of Alexander Nowell. He was baptised at Whalley, Lancashire, in 1542, and was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he became fellow, and in 1561 proceeded LL.B.
Hammond addressed Queen Elizabeth in a short Latin speech when she visited his college on 9 August 1564. In 1569 he was created LL.D. and admitted a member of the College of Civilians. On 6 February 1570 he became commissary of the deaneries of the Arches, Shoreham, and Croydon; in 1573 commissary to the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral; a master of chancery in 1574; and chancellor of the diocese of London in 1575.
Hammond acted on two commissions in 1577, one with reference to the restitution of goods belonging to Portuguese merchants, and the other concerning complaints of piracy preferred by Scots. In 1578 he attended the diet of Schmalkalden as a delegate from the English government, and in August 1580 went to Guernsey to investigate charges brought by the inhabitants against Sir Thomas Leighton, the governor.
In March 1580-1 Hammond took part in the examination by torture of Thomas Myagh, a prisoner in the Tower, charged with treasonable correspondence with Irish rebels. From 1572 onwards he was an active member of the ecclesiastical court of high commission. In May 1581 he examined Alexander Briant, a Jesuit, under torture in the Tower of London, and later in the year conducted repeated examinations of Edmund Campion, preparing points for discussion out of Nicholas Sander's "De Monarchia" and Richard Bristow's "Motives". On 29 April 1582 he similarly dealt with Thomas Alfield, a seminary priest, who was racked in the Tower.
Hammond sat as M.P. for Rye in the parliament meeting on 23 November 1585, and for West Looe in the parliament meeting in October 1586. He probably died in December 1589; his will, dated 21 December 1589, was proved on 12 October 1590. Some of his legal opinions survived in manuscript.
Family.
Hammond was father of John Hammond M.D.

Housewife (song)

'Housewife' arrived in August 2010 as a one-off release, and their fourth single overall, by the four-piece incarnation of British indie rock band The Cribs. On 9 August 2010, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe announced during his show that he would play a brand new song that night, something previously hinted at on the official band website several days previously. The release took fans and critics by surprise due to the secretive nature of the release.
Physical release.
Recorded at West Heath Studios, London by Ryan with assistance from frequent collaborator Edwyn Collins, John O'Mahony mixed the song at Sunset Sound Factory, Hollywood, California. The vinyl received the catalogue number 'WEBB271S'. A traditional set-up for the band, except with Ryan providing work on organ.
Etching and poem.
Unlike the majority of Cribs releases, the 7" vinyl featured no b-side. Instead, an etching appeared with the words 'SCAM', in addition to a message on the run-out groove stating 'insert me into your computer for additional content'. A poem, containing allusions to the song, appears on the back cover. The cover art featured Ryan and Gary dressed as the title of the single suggests, shot by Pat Graham, with the sleeve designed by Nick Scott, receiving assistance by Owen Richards, Corrado and Nell Frizzell.

August 2012 Mansehra Shia Massacre

August 2012 Mansehra Shia Massacre refers to the massacre of 25 Shia Muslim residents of Gilgit-Baltistan travelling from Rawalpindi, Punjab to Gilgit, Gilgit Baltistan in Pakistan. The bus was stopped in Mansehra District and the people were killed after checking their identification cards which showed they were from the Shia community by individuals dressed in Military uniforms. Darra Adam Khel faction of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan has claimed the responsibility for the attack.
Background.
Religious extremism is prevalent in Pakistan. Members of the Shia community are targeted in a number of attacks against them in the country. There have been several Incidents of killing of Shia Muslims and bomb blasts in the Shia mosque in Pakistan.
The Sunni extremist groups allied to or inspired by al-Qaeda and the Taliban routinely attack government and civilian targets in north-west Pakistan. They also attack the religious minorities and other Muslim sects that they consider to be infidels. The Shias in Pakistan frequently complain that " "the Pakistani state does little to stop the attacks and has even released from custody notorious militants accused of carrying them out.""
The sectarian violence incidents happened after the radical Islamisation policies of former military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq. In Gilgit Batistan sectarian violence emerged after the 1980s when religious extremists from tribal areas, Kohistan and Diamer attacked Gilgit.
The Pakistan government had planned and organised settlement of non-locals from tribal areas, Kohistan, Kashmir and parts of Punjab which further deteriorated the situation. This transformed the demography of the locals. In the 1990s the ratio of locals to non-locals was 4:1 but now it has been raised to 4:3. The rise of extremism and growth of unrest in Gilgit Baltistan shows that "sectarianism is officially being promoted as a calibrated policy to keep people engaged in trivial issues." A systematic ethnic cleansing of Shia community is being carried out in the Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Incident.
Three buses were travelling from Rawalpindi, Punjab to Gilgit, Gilgit Baltistan. On a section of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), in Mansehra District (an area dominated by Sunni tribes), 10 to 12 gunmen in military uniform flagged the buses for stopping. After the bus halted, the gunmen climbed on board and asked passengers for identification. They checked the identity cards of all the passengers. After which the gunmen dragged a group of Shia men. They were then sprayed with bullets from AK-47 Assault rifle.

Animal Husbandry (game)

Animal Husbandry () is a dice game invented and published by the Polish mathematician Karol Borsuk at his own expense in 1943, during the German occupation of Warsaw. Sales of the game were a way for Borsuk to support his family after he lost his job following the closure by the German occupation authorities of Warsaw University. The original sets were produced by hand by Borsuk's wife, Zofia. The author of the drawings of animals was Janina Borsuk née Śliwicka. The game was one of the first in the world to feature 12-sided dice.
The game achieved great popularity, first among friends of the family and then among wider circles of friends and strangers. However, for decades, all copies were thought to have been lost during the Warsaw Uprising and the aftermath of post-war chaos in Poland. But in the 1990s, a surviving set was found intact – and with the permission of the Borsuk family, and on the occasion of Borsuk's 90th birthday and the 15th anniversary of his death it was re-introduced into the Polish market under the title "Superfarmer" by the publisher GRANNA sp. In 2010 the original game was re-issued under the original title and with original graphics for the Warsaw Rising Museum and is available in its gift shop. The new edition was one of the items featured at the 1 Euro Design exhibition at Warsaw's Institute of Industrial Design.
Modern releases.
In subsequent years the game has been released in various languages, including English, German and Italian.

1st Proving Ground Group

The 1st Proving Ground Group is a disbanded United States Army Air Forces unit. It was last active with the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, based at Eglin Field, Florida, where it was disbanded on 1 April 1944. The unit's personnel/equipment/mission was taken over by the 610th Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAF Base Unit) and 611th AAF Base Unit.
The group was originally established as the 23d Composite Group and was part of the Air Corps Tactical School with a mission that focused on developing and demonstrating tactics and doctrine. After moving to Eglin it also conducted testing of experimental weapons.
History.
The group was established at Maxwell Field, Alabama in August 1939 as the 23d Composite Group. It was assigned the 1st Pursuit Squadron, 24th Bombardment Squadron (Light) (not manned until 1940) and the 54th Bombardment Squadron (Medium). 
Throughout the 1930s, there had been a number of attempts to have Air Corps tactical units demonstrate current tactics to students attending the Air Corps Tactical School, which was the advanced school for Air Corps officers. The impracticability of scheduling a recently trained unit with modern aircraft for these demonstrations led the school to recommend the formation of a composite unit permanently stationed with the school as early as 1932. The recommendation was disapproved because of the lack of personnel or equipment that could be dedicated to this mission. The establishment of the group was finally approved in August 1939, with the understanding that the group would also assume the demonstration and exhibition function that was being carried out by combat units of Air Force Combat Command.
The group was also assigned the mission of performing tactical service tests of aircraft and other equipment; developing and testing new air tactics; and demonstrating these new tactics to the service schools of the other branches of the Army, to General Headquarters, and at Air Corps stations. However, because the Tactical School suspended classes in June 1940, because experienced officers were required for the expansion of the Air Corps in response to the war in Europe and could not be spared for a nine-month long school, the group was only able to support the school for a short time. In September 1940, the group moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, which would become the base for the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics.
The group transferred from Orlando for assignment to Eglin Field to conduct flight testing activities in July 1941. At Eglin it was redesignated as the Air Corps Proving Ground Detachment, then the Air Corps Proving Ground Group. On 1 May 1942, the group's three original squadrons were disbanded as it focused on weapons development rather than tactics.
In 1944, the group conducted "Operation Crossbow" program to determine the best method of attacking German V-1 “buzz bomb” sites along the French and Dutch coasts, February 1944. Began testing the Republic-Ford JB-2, an American version of the German V-1, which became the foundation of the Air Force guided missile program, October 1944. 
The AAF found standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the support mission. Accordingly a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. Accordingly the group was disbanded and the testing mission and associated personnel of the group were assumed by the 611th AAF Base Unit (Flight Test) (later 611th AF Base Unit (Proof Test Group)). At the same time the 610th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Proving Ground Complement) assumed the equipment, and personnel of the group associated with base support as well as those of the 118th WAC Post Headquarters Company, 2051st Ordnance Company, Aviation (Service), 869th Signal Service Company (Aviation), 24th Aviation Squadron, 4th AAF Emergency Rescue Boat Squadron, and 1453d Quartermaster Service Company (Aviation). Later in 1944, the 610th assumed the electronics and flight test activities of the 611th and became the 610th AAF Base Unit (Flight Test).
The 610th transferred its base support activities to the 609th AAF Base Unit (Airdrome Group) in January 1947 and was discontinued on 1 August 1947 with its mission assumed by Army Air Forces Proving Ground (Provisional). The 611th AAF Base Unit was discontinued on 9 July 1948, when the Air Proving Ground Command reorganized according to the Wing/Base (Hobson Plan) model.

Ikeja City Mall

The Ikeja City Mall is a mall in Ikeja. It is the first shopping mall in Ikeja, and the Mainland of Lagos.
Construction.
The Ikeja City Mall which commenced construction in May 2010, was initially scheduled to open for trade in November 2011 but opened at a slightly later December date. 
The collapse of the massive Ikeja City Mall under construction might have been caused by human error. 
This view was held by a building expert, Mr. Kunle Awobodu, while speaking with the Nigerian Tribune on Friday in Lagos.
A section of the building came crashing on Thursday, December 9, 2010 leaving five people seriously injured. 
From observation, the collapse was due to the centering which caused the collapse of the slab. Except for two columns that buckled, all other columns cast before the collapse remained standing and unaffected.
A building Expert, Mr Kunle Awobodu, whilst speaking to reporters noted that the problem might have arisen from the acroprops and scaffolding as well as the timber members or boards for the beams and slabs which might have been a result of human error.
Description.
The shopping center, which features the first and only cinema theatre in Ikeja, also has a 5-screen Silverbird Cinemas and Shoprite Supermarket. It also include specialist facilities for department stores, banks, cafés, bars, restaurants, hairdressing / beauty salon, etc.
Stores.
The mall opened on December 14 2011 and currently has 94 tenants, with some of the big brands as
. Bheerhugz Cafe 
And others
Expansion.
To better serve consumers, the Ikeja City Mall, home to international and local brands, is set to add new sections to the mall.
The new sections, according to the Centre Manager, Mrs. Debola Majekodunmi, will include the children section and a cinema hall.
Speaking at a recent media briefing, Majekodunmi also stated that the new sections would include popular food court, adding that the step was necessary to make the mall a destination point that caters for all members of the family.
Name Controversy.
The common notion of referring to the mall as Shoprite is wrong, as the South African store are merely tenants in Ikeja City Mall.
Shoprite is only one out of Ikeja City Mall's 94 tenants but the brand is only lucky to enjoy good patronage because of its global appeal. Ikeja City Mall is owned by Gruppo Investment Nigeria Limited and managed by Broll Nigeria, a subsidiary of Broll South Africa, a member of the CBRE affiliate network.
June 2012 Shut down.
All the stores in the N16 billion Ikeja City Mall located at Alausa, Ikeja, were all shut down on June 12, 2012 by their owners in protest against the new parking fee of N300 per hour implemented by the owners of the mall. Store owners refused to open their stores until the parking fees are either cancelled or reduced to an affordable rate, because they believed that the parking fee will chase away customers.

In the later half of the 16th century in the far north of Scotland Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland (chief of Clan Sutherland) and George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness (chief of Clan Sinclair) were at deadly feud with each other. Alexander Gordon, Earl of Sutherland was supported by his relative George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly (chief of Clan Gordon), whose sister the Earl of Sutherland married. Between the two sides was Huistean Mackay who supported both but was in a weak position, being at the head of a divided clan.
The dispute among the Clan Mackay was over who was the rightful chief. Some believed that John Beg Mackay and Donald Balloch Mackay who were born from Iye Du Mackay’s first marriage were rightful chiefs. However this marriage was an irregular one under canon law as it was a marriage of first cousins. Others supported Huistean Mackay. When Huistean obtained legal possession of his lands he gave Scourie to Donald Balloch Mackay, only surviving son from the first marriage. This served as a settlement but the two families remained disunited.
Huistean Mackay and his younger brother William Mackay, 1st of Bighouse were initially supporters of George Sinclair, Earl of Caithness. Huistean had even resided at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe until he was old enough to lead his own clan. In the meantime John Beg Mackay, a cousin of Huistean's father had been in control of the Mackay lands of Strathnaver; however the Earl of Caithness had instigated the Mackays of Aberach, a powerful and very much independent branch of the Mackays to attack him on a plea of alleged unfaithfulness to Huistean Mackay. The Mackays of Aberach did this along with the MacLeods of Assynt, killing John Beg Mackay, William Gunn (chieftain of the Robson Gunns) and others at Balnakeil in the parish of Durness in 1579, and the chieftain of Clan Matheson barely escaped with his life. This left Huistean Mackay’s followers divided. On the one side were the Robson Gunns and Mathesons and on the other side were the MacLeods of Assynt and the Mackays of Aberach. Huistean Mackay chose to oppose the "Aberachs". The "Aberach" Mackays then "rushed to the open arms of the Earl of Sutherland".
Historian Angus Mackay states that as long as Huistean Mackay and Sinclair, Earl of Caithness stood together they were more than a match for the Earl of Sutherland, notwithstanding the defection of some Mackay clansman (the Aberachs). By 1585 Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Gordon, Earl of Huntly stood together with the support of the Aberach Mackays and the MacLeods of Assynt. On the other side stood Sinclair, Earl of Caithness, Huistean Mackay, chief of Clan Mackay and the Robson Gunns. In 1585 Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Gordon, Earl of Huntly held a meeting at Elgin along with Sinclair, Earl of Caithness in an attempt to break up Sinclair’s confederacy with Huistean Mackay and the Gunns. Sinclair was offered Huntly’s sister in marriage if he destroyed the Gunns. A second meeting was called at Dunrobin Castle in which Huistean Mackay also attended. Mackay refused the Gordon's proposals but Sinclair, Earl of Caithness agreed with the Gordons that the Gunns should be destroyed. In 1586 the forces of the Earl of Caithness and the Earl of Sutherland pursued the Gunns from Caithness and into the hills of Strathnaver. At this time a strange coincidence took place: William Mackay of Bighouse (younger brother of Huistean) had raided the MacLeods taking much cattle. As William Mackay was returning home he came across the Earl of Sutherland's men who were searching for the Gunns and a fight took place over the cattle. William Mackay's men fought a rear guard action and the following morning stumbled across the Gunns retiring from the Sinclairs of Caithness. Together the Mackays and Gunns attacked the Sinclairs of Caithness defeating them and killing their leader Henry Sinclair, cousin of the Earl of Caithenss. This was known as the Battle of Allt Camhna.
Huistean Du Mackay at this time had been residing at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe and had to flee for his life back to Strathnaver and the Gunns, realizing the Mackays could not protect them retired to Ross-shire only to be defeated at the Battle of Leckmelm by the Mackays of Aberach, MacLeods and Sutherlands.
The new alliance between Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Sinclair, Earl of Caithness did not last long and soon they were feuding again. In February 1587 the Sinclairs killed Gordon of Marle and made preparations to invade Sutherland. In March the Earl of Caithness, supported by Huistean Du Mackay advanced on Sutherland where they found the Earl supported by Mackintosh, Mackenzie of Redcastle and Munro of Contullich Castle, who were posted on the west bank of the river. For some days there was skirmishing between the two armies on both sides of the water. The Earl of Sutherland sent Mackintosh across to try and persuade Huistean Mackay to desert the Earl of Caithness. The Earl of Sutherland himself also met with the Earl of Caithness who agreed terms that excluded Mackay. On hearing of this Mackay marched his men back to Strathnaver, thus ending the alliance between Mackay and Caithness.
In December 1589 Huistean Mackay married Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of the Earl of Sutherland. The Earl of Sutherland having gained the support of Mackay swept into Caithness accompanied by Mackay, Mackintosh and Munro. They swept the county to the walls of Castle Sinclair Girnigoe. The castle was to strong to take without artillery and so they sacked the town of Wick. The family of Sinclair never again held the same commanding position in northern politics. That same year McHamish Gunn, chief of the Clan Gunn again wasted Caithness with great ferocity. In 1590 the Earl of Caithness invaded Sutherland in person fighting stubbornly and advancing as far as Brora. In the meantime Mackay slipped into Caithness and spoiled it to the gates of Thurso. The feud continued for many years after. In 1601 the Earl of Caithness’s army lined up in front of the Earl of Sutherland’s which included Huistean Mackay, Munro of Contullich and MacLeod of Assynt. The Caithness men retreated without a fight.
A contemporary historian, Sir Robert Gordon (1580–1630) writes of Huistean Du Mackay in one of the battles against the forces of Sinclair, Earl of Caithness.:
Later life and family.
Huistean Du Mackay’s first marriage was to Lady Elizabeth Sinclair, daughter of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness who he divorced but had had one daughter with, Christina who married John Mackintish of Davell, son the chief of Clan Mackintosh. He married secondly (as mentioned above) Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland and had the following two sons and two daughters:
Huistean Du Mackay died on the 2nd of September 1614 at Tongue and was succeeded by his eldest son.

Steiger (mining)

A Steiger (literally "climber") is the title of a mine manager or mining foreman, used in German-speaking Europe. He bears responsibility for part of the mine and the people subordinated to him. The name is derived from the former role of a "Steiger", who continually had to climb into and out of the pit. The "Steiger" is celebrated in a very popular German mining song the so-called "Steigerlied" ("Glückauf, Glückauf; der Steiger kommt …").
Anforderungvoraussetzungen und Ausbildung.
Der Steiger musste für die Ausübung seiner Tätigkeiten bestimmte fachliche Voraussetzungen erfüllen. Da im Bergbau viel mit Holz gearbeitet wurde, war eine Voraussetzung an den Steiger, dass er Kenntnisse über die Holzbearbeitung hatte. Dies war erforderlich, damit er alle Arten der Grubenzimmerung bei seinen Befahrungen kontrollieren und notfalls instand setzen konnte. Außerdem musste er Kenntnisse von der Gebirgskunde, der Erz- und Gesteinskunde und der Aufbereitungskunde haben. Um diesen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden, war zunächst eine langjährige praktische bergmännische Ausbildung erforderlich, die mit dem Bergknecht als unterster Stufe begann. Im Anschluss daran war der erfolgreiche Besuch einer Bergschule Voraussetzung für das weitere Fortkommen. Zugelassen zur Bergschule wurden nur Bergleute, die bei einem Bergwerk beschäftigt waren und die bereits die niedrigen Arbeitsstufen überschritten hatten. Um die Stelle eines Bergofficianten, wie dem Obersteiger, zu bekleiden, war der erfolgreiche Besuch der Bergakademie erforderlich.
Neben der fachlich Eignung wurden an die Funktion eines Steigers auch verschiedene andere Anforderungen gestellt. Er hatte sich gegenüber seinen Vorgesetzten und dem Grubenvorstand mit gebührender Achtung zu verhalten. Er musste einen christlichen, nüchternen und anständigen Lebenswandel führen und somit seinen Untergebenen ein gutes Vorbild sein. Gegenüber seinen Steigerkollegen musste er sich kollegial höflich verhalten. Er musste sich gegenüber den Grundbesitzern höflich verhalten. Den ihm gegenüber vorgesetzten Behörden hatte er den schuldigen Gehorsam zu leisten. Auch hatte er eine korrekte bergmännische Tracht zu tragen. Fernerhin dufte der Steiger weder der Bruder noch der Vetter des Schichtmeisters der Zeche sein, auf der er beschäftigt war.
Spezialisierungen.
Aufgrund der Vielzahl der unterschiedlichen Arbeiten war es insbesondere bei den größeren Bergwerken erforderlich, dass sich die Steiger entsprechend ihrer Kenntnisse spezialisierten. Entsprechend den vom Steiger zu beaufsichtigenden Bergleuten gab es beispielsweise "Zimmersteiger", "Kunststeiger", "Mauersteiger" und "Scheidesteiger". Auch für die Steiger, die andere Tätigkeiten beaufsichtigten, gab es spezielle Bezeichnungen. So gab es für die Hängebank den Hängebanksteiger, dieser beaufsichtigte die Haspelzieher und die Bergleute, die die gestürzten Mineralberge wegladen mussten. Für die Nachtschicht gab es oftmals einen Steiger, der des Nachts die gesamten anfallenden Arbeiten zu beaufsichtigen hatte, er wurde "Nachschichtsteiger" genannt. Für die Beaufsichtigung der Scheidejungen gab es den Jungensteiger, auch Scheidesteiger genannt. Dieser musste die Scheidejungen zu ordentlicher Scheidearbeit anhalten und diese, wenn sie grobe Fehler gemacht hatten, auch streng bestrafen.
Aufgaben und Arbeitszeit.
Der Steiger hatte die Aufsicht über die unterstellten Bergleute zu führen. Er musste die Bergleute bei ihrer Arbeit unterweisen und dafür sorgen, dass genügend Material für den Betrieb vorhanden war. Der Arbeitstag begann für den Steiger schon vor dem Anfang der eigentlichen Arbeitszeit. Früh morgens musste er im Bethaus dem Frühgebet der Bergleute beiwohnen und die Anwesenheitskontrolle durchführen. Er hatte darauf zu achten, dass die Bergleute die vorgeschriebene bergmännische Tracht trugen. Anschließend begab er sich in die Grube, um die Arbeitsplätze zu befahren. Besondere Vorkommnisse musste er nach der Schicht an den Betriebsdirigenten melden. Die Arbeitszeit betrug in der Regel zwölf Stunden und endete meistens erst um 16°° Uhr am Nachmittag. An den Wochenenden brauchte er keine zwölf Stunden auf dem Bergwerk bleiben, er musste aber kontrollieren, dass alle Bergleute die Grube verlassen hatten. Auch musste er an den Wochenenden die Arbeitszeit der Bergleute so regeln, dass diese am Sonntag in die Kirche gehen konnten. Die Arbeitszeit der Bergleute betrug an den Wochenenden acht Stunden. Konnte ein Steiger aus zwingenden Gründen eine Schicht nicht versehen oder musste er aus bestimmten Gründen die Schicht vorzeitig beenden, so musste er vorher bei seinem Vorgesetzten die Erlaubnis einholen. 
Neben seinen Aufsichtstätigkeiten hatte der Steiger auch schriftliche Arbeiten zu tätigen, dies waren beispielsweise das Führen des Betriebsbuches und des Schichtenbuches. Außerdem die Erstellung der monatlichen Betriebsberichte, das Anfertigen der Strafregister und der Büchsenzettel. An den Aufgaben und der Arbeitszeit änderte sich bis in die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts kaum etwas. Selbst im Jahr 1957 betrug die tägliche Arbeitszeit eines Steigers oftmals bis elf Stunden. Der Arbeitstag begann um 5:30 Uhr mit der Frühbesprechung und endete mit der Nachmittagsbesprechung mit dem Obersteiger und dem Betriebsführer um 16°° Uhr, dazwischen lagen etwa 7,5 Stunden Arbeitszeit Untertage.
Bezahlung.
Obwohl die Steiger Beamte waren, waren für ihre Entlohnung die Bergwerksbesitzer zuständig. Da der Lohn der Steiger von den Gewerken bestimmt wurde, war er je nach Bergbaurevier unterschiedlich. So erhielten die Steiger beispielsweise in der Hettongrube einen Wochenlohn von sechs Talern und neun Silbergroschen. Damit lag der Lohn des Steigers genausohoch wie der eines Zimmerers. Für den Verkauf der Lichter und des Lampenöls erhielten sie noch eine kleine Provision. Dadurch stieg ihr Wochenlohn auf zwölf Taler, sieben Silbergroschen und sechs Pfennige an. Während des Regalbergbaus genossen die Steiger allerdings die gleichen Privilegien wie auch die anderen Bergleute. In den Bergrevieren der Grafschaft Mark und dem Herzogtum Cleve war es den Steigern verboten, Arbeiter und Hauer in Kost zu nehmen, um damit ihren Lohn aufzubessern. So stand in der Bergordnung der Hinweis: „"Schichtmeister, Steiger und Arbeiter sollen mit ihrem gesetzten Lohn sich begnügen lassen..."“ In den Bergrevieren Sachsens war es staatlich geregelt, dass der Lohn der Steiger auf allen Zechen einheitlich hoch sein musste. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass die Bergwerksbesitzer die Löhne der Steiger und Bergleute in bestimmte Lohnstufen unterteilten. Die Entlohnung erfolgte durch Gedinge oder durch Festlohn.
Heutige Situation.
In der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts kam es zu einer weiteren Änderung des Status bei den Steigern. Steiger waren aufgrund einer Gesetzesänderung nunmehr keine Beamten mehr, sondern sie wurden zu Angestellten. Von nun an konnten die Bergwerksbesitzer Steiger anstellen und entlassen. Die Änderungen mussten dem Bergamt mitgeteilt werden. Mit dem Inkrafttreten des Bundesberggesetzes hat sich einiges für den Steiger geändert. Im Bundesberggesetz wird nicht mehr von Steigern, sondern von "Verantwortlichen Personen" gesprochen. Verantwortliche Personen im Sinne des Gesetzes sind alle zur Leitung und Beaufsichtigung des Betriebes bestellten Personen. Personen, die als Verantwortliche Personen eingesetzt werden, müssen vom Unternehmer beim Bergamt schriftlich gemeldet (bestellt) werden. Werden sie wieder abberufen ist diese Abberufung ebenfalls dem Bergamt schriftlich zu melden. 
Hierarchie.
Die unterste Ebene der Hierarchie bildet im heutigen Bergbau der Schichtsteiger. Er führt eine Betriebsschicht in einem Revier. Zwischen drei und acht Schichtsteiger unterstehen einem Reviersteiger. Die Reviersteiger sind die nächsthöhere Ebene in der Hierarchie. Über den Reviersteigern stehen in der Hierarchieebene die Fahrsteiger. Ein Fahrsteiger ist der Leiter einer Fahrabteilung, zu der ein bis drei Reviere gehören. Somit unterstehen dem Fahrsteiger zwischen einem und drei Reviersteiger und drei bis vierundzwanzig Schichtsteiger. Über den Fahrsteigern steht der Obersteiger, er ist der Stellvertreter des Betriebsführers und ihm direkt unterstellt. Dem Obersteiger unterstehen zwischen ein bis drei Fahrsteiger, sowie den jeweiligen Fahrsteigern unterstellte Reviersteiger und Schichtsteiger. Somit können einem Obersteiger, neben den Fahrsteigern, je nach Größe des Bergwerks bis zu neun Reviersteiger und bis zu 72 Schichtsteiger unterstellt sein. Auf einem Bergwerk können, je nach Größe, fünf oder auch mehr Obersteiger tätig sein.
Anforderungvoraussetzungen und Ausbildung.
Die Anforderungsvoraussetzungen werden im Bundesberggesetz im § 59 geregelt. So müssen Verantwortliche Personen die erforderliche Fachkunde besitzen. Außerdem müssen sie für ihre Aufgaben körperlich geeignet sein und die erforderliche Zuverlässigkeit besitzen. Um die nötige Fachkunde als Voraussetzung für die Tätigkeit als Steiger nachzuweisen, ist der erfolgreiche Besuch einer Bergfachschule (Technikerschule), einer Bergschule (Fachschule) oder eines Studiums an einer technischen Hochschule sowie die Bestellung als Aufsichtsperson durch eine Bergbehörde erforderlich.
Spezialisierungen.
Man unterscheidet zwischen bergmännischen Steigern (Grubensteiger) wie Abbausteiger, Fördersteiger, Wettersteiger, Vermessungssteiger sowie Elektrosteigern, Maschinensteigern und Sicherheitssteigern.
Grubensteiger sind auf dem Bergwerk dafür verantwortlich, dass die bergmännischen Arbeiten in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich des Grubenbetriebs fachgerecht und störungsfrei durchgeführt werden können. Wettersteiger sind Steiger, die für die Grubenbewetterung verantwortlich sind. Zum Wettersteiger werden nur Personen ernannt, die eine Ausbildung an einer Bergfachschule oder einer noch weitergehenden bergmännischen Ausbildungsstätte mit Erfolg absolviert haben. Sie müssen eine zusätzliche Ausbildung zum Wettersteiger absolvieren. Elektrosteiger sind auf dem Bergwerk verantwortlich für die elektrischen Anlagen, für deren Betriebsbereitschaft und Sicherheit über oder unter Tage. Sie kontrollieren, ob durchgeführte Wartungs- und Reparaturarbeiten ordnungsgemäß durchgeführt wurden. Maschinensteiger sind auf dem Bergwerk verantwortlich für die verschiedenen Maschinen und Geräte. Maschinensteiger sind verantwortlich für die Funktion der Maschinen und veranlassen im erforderlichen Fall, damit es nicht zu Unfällen kommt, deren Stillsetzung.
Aufgaben und Arbeitszeit.
Die Aufgaben der Steiger änderten sich drastisch mit dem Inkrafttreten der Allgemeinen Bundesbergverordnung. Gemäß dieser Verordnung ist es nicht mehr Hauptaufgabe der Steiger, über betriebliche Dinge zu wachen, sondern für die Arbeitssicherheit der ihnen unterstellten Mitarbeiter zu sorgen. Da der Unternehmer die Pflichten auf die Verantwortlichen Personen übertragen kann, sind also in erster Linie die Steiger als Verantwortliche Personen in der Pflicht, den Schutz der Arbeitnehmer vor Gefahren zu gewährleisten. Jeder Steiger muss die ihm zugewiesenen Betriebsbereiche und Arbeitsstätten, an denen in der Schicht Mitarbeiter von ihm beschäftigt sind, zweimal und bei ungefährlichen Arbeiten einmal pro Tag befahren. Als zweite Befahrung gilt auch ein Telefonat mit den an dem jeweiligen Arbeitsplatz befindlichen Arbeitnehmern. Aufgrund des Arbeitszeitgesetzes wurden die täglichen Arbeitszeiten auch für den Steiger reduziert. So dürfen auch Steiger täglich nur noch acht Stunden und in Ausnahmefällen maximal 10 Stunden beschäftigt werden. In einigen Bergbaubereiche kommt aufgrund der hohen untertägigen Temperaturen die Klimabergverordnung zum Greifen. Die hier geltenden Reduzierungen der Beschäftigungszeiten gelten auch für Steiger, sodass Steiger, die in Klimabereichen tätig sind. eine Arbeitszeit von sieben bis acht Stunden haben.
Bezahlung.
Im heutigen Bergbau richtet sich die Bezahlung der Steiger nach den Tarifverträgen der jeweiligen Bergbaubranche.

1970 Targa Florio

The 1970 Targa Florio was an endurance race that took place on May 3, 1970. It was held on a 44.6 mi (71.8 km) anti-clockwise circuit made up entirely of public roads on the mountainous Italian island of Sicily. It was the fifth round of the 1970 World Sportscar Championship season.
Pre-race.
The Targa Florio was in 1970 the oldest motor race in the world, even older than the Isle of Man TT and the Indianapolis 500. First run in 1906, it was run on narrow public mountain roads that went up and down, and twisted and turned around the Sicilian countryside. The race was run on a number of variants over the years- from 1932 to 1936 and 1951 to 1977 it was run on the 45 mile Piccolo (Italian for small) course- by far the longest circuit on the 1970 World Sportscar Championship calendar. It was one of, if not the last genuine street races still run in the world. The previous courses were 67 and 92 miles long; and there were 680 mile Island tour versions run in the early 1910s and the late 1940s. The Piccolo course went through 4 to 5 towns in the island of Sicily; it was one of the last genuine street races still being run in the world. The circuit was extremely demanding and very difficult to learn- over the 45 mile course, there were between 800 and 900 corners- 16 to 20 corners for every mile, and the circuit had about 2,000 feet of elevation change- twice that of the Nurburgring. There was also a number of straights joined together by a number of fast corners at the top of the circuit that measured out to about 6 miles- but the circuit was so twisty and had so many corners, average speeds never went past even 80 mph (128 km/h)- which in racing terms is very slow. The circuit was also very dangerous- although the streets were closed off to the public for the race (but not for the practice and test sessions- this caused all sorts of problems) the circuit was identical to every day civilian use, so it had no safety features of any kind and a crash often meant tumbling down a mountain slope or when in a town, crashing into a stone building, trees, and even groups of spectators.
The Targa Florio, was unusual in that it was a time trial race against the clock as opposed to a race for physical position. Like most races that take place on extremely long courses such as the Isle of Man TT, the Mille Miglia and some other Italian public road races, each car was started one at a time on the road at timed intervals, much like how a rally-type race is started instead of the cars starting alongside each other, which is almost always the case in general circuit racing and on every other race on the sportscar championship calendar in 1970. So, for example, Car A would be started at 10 minutes after Car B. Once Car B starts and as more race distance would be covered, if Car B was then 9 minutes behind Car A on the road, then Car B would actually be 1 minute in front of Car A. So it was really a driving challenge to see what car could cover the 11-lap distance the quickest- this is almost identical to how a rally works; the Madonie Piccolo course used roads that would be suited for a rally. Most drivers only knew what their position was every 35–50 minutes, and that was when they reached the start-finish line in the town of Cerda; or in more organized team's cases, in another town or on some part of the isolated section of the track, where members of teams would wait for their team's car to come by and they would show pitboards showing their position and how much time their opponents are in front or behind them, which was sometimes out of date; communication in those days was very limited (compared to now).
For this event, Porsche introduced their new car, the light and nimble 908/03, which was better suited to the twisty and demanding circuit than the big and powerful 917 (although Vic Elford managed to post the fifth fastest overall time with a spare 917K on Friday practice). Porsche motorsports chief Ferdinand Piëch (a grandson of founder Ferdinand Porsche) and his team brought 4 908/03's to the island; 3 were given to John Wyer and his factory-supported team and 1 was run as an official works car. The 908/03, unlike the 917K, was of exclusive use for the factory teams.
Race distance was lengthened to 11 laps as opposed to 10 in the years previous.
Pole position went to the Wyer 908/03 of Jo Siffert/Brian Redman, followed by the official works 908/03 of Vic Elford/Hans Herrmann, the sole works Ferrari 512S of Sicilian Nino Vaccarella/Ignazio Giunti, a works Alfa Romeo T33/3 of Piers Courage/Andrea De Adamich and then another Wyer 908/03 of Leo Kinnunen/Pedro Rodriguez.
The 908/03's had a 3-liter Flat-8 engine; so they were entered in the 3-liter prototype class; as opposed to the big-engined Flat-12 917's and V12 Ferrari 512's which were competing in the 5-liter prototype class.
There were 12 different classes of racing- more than any other race on the calendar.
Race.
The turnout for the race exceeded 400,000 people; the large amount of area the circuit covered helped to spread people out.
Rodriguez was ill on raceday, so his co-driver, ex-rally driver Kinnunen took over as #1, and, in the rally-type event, sprinted into the lead in front of the Siffert/Redman 908/03. Once the car was handed off to Rodriguez, he lost the lead on the 7th lap to Redman. Once Kinnunen was back in, he set the fastest ever lap of the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie circuit- 33 minutes, 36.0 seconds on the last lap; and he managed to finish second to the Siffert/Redman car. There was some consolation for the Italian fans- homeland hero Nino Vaccarella in the sole works Ferrari 512 finished 3rd, the works Alfa of Courage/De Adamich crashed on the 8th lap and Elford also crashed the official works 908/03 on the first lap.
This was the 10th time a Porsche had won the Targa outright, a Porsche's first victory was in 1956. A final victory would come in 1973, when a Porsche 911 won outright. Porsche, on a track generally suited to their general design philosophy, hold the record for most victories at the Targa, a race which dated back to 1906.

Faiveley Transport

Faiveley Transport (), formerly Faiveley, is an international manufacturer and supplier of equipment for the railway industry founded in 1919. It introduced the single-arm pantograph in 1955. The company has subsidiaries in more than 24 countries.
History.
First years.
In 1919, Louis Faiveley founded in Saint Ouen, France, the "Établissments Louis Faiveley", a small assembly shop centered on electromechanical parts. It soon grew and became one of the French railway system's leading suppliers. It introduced in 1923 its first pantograph. In 1930, it also ventured in the manufacture of door systems for trains. By the 30s, it was already one of the France's leading companies in all its fields of activity. In 1935, the company became a Societé Anonyme, although the shares' majority stayed in hands of the Faiveley family.
After the Second World War, the company quickly recovered. In 1946, it introduced electric heating systems. In 1955, it helped set a new high-speed train record, as a Faiveley-equipped train exceeded 331 kilometres per hour. That year, Faiveley also introduced the first commercial single-arm pantograph. This innovation helped the company to ensure its position as world leader in railroad system pantographs.
Internationalisation.
In 1961, the company created a research and development division with the aim of adapting electronic applications to the railroad industry, included automatic door systems. It also begun to equipe the new rubber-wheeled Paris Metro cars. In 1965, the company started to produce automatic doors for buildings, creating in 1968 a subsidiary specifically for this area: Faiveley Automatismes.
The company continued its expansion. In 1966, it opened a subsidiary in Spain. In 1976, one in Brazil (Equipfer). In 1979, was created the Italian branch. Attempts to enter into the American and Canadian markets, however, were not as successful. Only in the late 90s it could settle in those countries.
France remained as Faiveley's core market. During the 70s, the company introduced new corail coaches for the SNCF and provided equipment for a new generation of subway trains, the MF77. In 1972, Faiveley presented its first very-high-speed pantograph. Soon after, it introduced its first electric automated road system.
In 1984, Faiveley purchased Saint-Gobain subsidiary Air-Industrie's transport division, giving it operations in passenger train air conditioning systems. That year, it acquired from the Matra's subsidiary Interlec its tachometry activities. Together with the company's other transportation-related activities, these subsidiary operations were gathered into a newly created subsidiary: Faiveley Transport.
The company was one of the suppliers of the new SNCF's TGV trains. In 1990, its pantographs were key to achieve a new 513.3 kilometres per hour record by TGV Atlantique.
In 1991, the company moved its headquarters to Saint-Pierre-des-Corps.
Diversification.
With competition becoming more intense in its field of activity, Faiveley decided it was time to expand their operations.
In 1992, the company acquired plastics product maker Grand-Perret. In 1993, Faiveley moved to concentrate its activities around its historic core of railroad and transportation equipment and its brand new plastics division, selling its Faiveley Automatismes subsidiary. It also made an aggressive move to increase its business in the Japanese market, one of the most important at the time, forming a joint venture with Nabco called Nabco-Faiveley Ltd which became one of leading providers of Japan's railroad. Later, Faiveley partnered also with Mitsui. That year Faivaley created a British subsidiary, to take a part of the business in the recently privatised rail system.
In 1994, Faiveley was listed on the Paris Bourse. In 1995, it acquired VPI-Verchère Plastiques Industriels, a thermo-injected plastic company. The following year, Faiveley added the operations of Rhône Moulage and Sepal Ltd, two companies also centered in plastics. By the end of the decade, that material had risen to nearly 20 percent of Faiveley's total sales.
In 1995. Faiveley purchased the German railroad air conditioning company Hagenuk Fahrzeugklima from its parent company Siemens. The purchase was a key step into the German market as well as the Asian through is Chinese subsidiary Shanghai Hagenuk Refrigerating Machine, but also brought losses to the company during the following years. This led to a reorganisation that included staff reductions in Germany and France and changes in the Board of Directors.
In December 2002, Faiveley purchased a 75 percent stake in the Czech pantograph and electro-mechanical equipment supplier Lekov. In 2004, it acquired the train brakes manufacturer Sab Wabco and the air conditioning manufacturer Neu Systèmes. In eary 2007, it purchased the electronic systems and rolling stock manufacturer ESPAS group. Faiveley CX pantographs were fitted in the V150 TGV's record-breaking attempt of 2007, which set a new world railway speed record of 574.8 kilometres per hour.
In April 2008, the company acquired from Carbone Lorraine its sintered brake material manufacturing and design department. In July of that year, it purchased the American freight wagon components' manufacturer Ellcon-National.
In September 2009 Faiveley SA and its subsidiary Faiveley Transport merged into a sole company, called Faiveley Transport SA.
In March 2011, the company purchased an 80 percent stake in the rolling stock heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment manufacturer Urs Dolder AG and the remaining stake of Lekov.
During 2011 the company won major contracts in several countries, including Canada, the United States, Australia Italy, Switzerland, and Germany.
On 3 February 2012, Faiveley Transport completed the purchase of Graham-White, an American designer and manufacturer of compressed air drying and brake systems for rail transport.
In February 2013, the company won a trial against Wabtec for the acts of unfair competition and secrets violation.
Current activities.
Faiveley Transport offers a wide range of products related to the train equipment, such as cabin heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); HVAC system room, air distribution ducts, exhaust, urs dolder heaters; pantographs and high voltage switches, energy meters, auxiliary power converters, master controllers and driver awareness system.

Britney 2.0

"Britney 2.0" is the second episode of the fourth season of the American musical television series "Glee", and the 68th episode overall. Written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, it aired on Fox in the United States on September 20, 2012, and features "Glee" second episode dedicated to the music of Britney Spears. Special guest star Kate Hudson returns as Rachel's dance instructor, Cassandra July.
The episode was watched by 7.46 million viewers, making it the most watched episode of the fourth season.
Plot.
In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) rent a small apartment and move in together. At the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), Rachel continues to be pressured by her dance instructor, Cassandra July (Kate Hudson), who refuses to teach Rachel tango because she thinks she lacks sex appeal. Kurt reveals that Cassandra used to be a promising star on Broadway but wrecked her first performance so dramatically due to pressure that no one wanted to hire her again.
Meanwhile, in Lima, Ohio, Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) performs Britney Spears's "Hold It Against Me" during cheerleading practice before being interrupted by coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who kicks her off the Cheerios due to her bad grades and replaces her with Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin). This, in addition to the busy schedule of her girlfriend, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), who is attending University of Louisville, causes Brittany to become depressed. Hoping to cheer her up, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) convinces glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to have New Directions perform Britney Spears' songs. Subsequently, Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) perform a mash-up of "Boys" and Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend", for Brittany, and she is once more inspired by Spears. 
New member Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) confides to Wade "Unique" Adams (Alex Newell) that she is interested in troublemaker Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), leading to a performance of "Womanizer", during which Jake invites Marley to "hang out". At the bleachers, Marley meets up with Jake and they perform a mash-up of "(You Drive Me) Crazy" and Aerosmith's "Crazy", as they share a romantic moment. Jake later hears two students mocking Marley and her mother (Trisha Rae Stahl) and confronts them, leading to a fight. Will interrupts the altercation and sends Jake to the choir room, where he's surprised to find his half-brother Noah "Puck" Puckerman (Mark Salling), who now lives in Los Angeles. Puck introduces himself to Jake and convinces him to join New Directions, so that the experience can help Jake just as it helped Puck.
In New York City, Rachel enlists the help of her friend, NYADA upperclassman Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), to prove to Cassandra that she can be sexy by performing a sultry rendition of "Oops!... I Did It Again"; however, the number fails to impress Cassandra. Rachel accuses her of hating her students because they may have a future in show business, while Cassandra has none, leading an infuriated Cassandra to kick her out of her class. Brody later comforts Rachel and tries to kiss her, but she refuses, as she is still in love with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). Brody agrees to respect Rachel's relationship, but admits he has feelings for her. Rachel apologizes to Cassandra and Cassandra allows her to come back to class. Cassandra then explains that show business is a world with a lot of harsh realities and she wants Rachel and her other students to be prepared for it and that is the reason why she is hard on her students. 
In Lima, Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) performs an acoustic version of "3" with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Joe Hart (Glee) (Samuel Larsen). Brittany attempts to shave her head and is stopped by Will, after which she walks into the hallway, only to be provoked by Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), who she beats up with an umbrella in front of the student body. To cheer Brittany up, New Directions members suggest she should lead the school assembly. Brittany objects that her voice is not up to par, and suggests they lip sync, an idea they rebuke at first, but she manages to convince them. New Directions performs "Gimme More" at the school assembly, but the performance is a disaster due to Brittany's lack of motivation, leading the student body to discover that Brittany was lip-synching to the song. They are booed off of the stage and reprimanded by Will in the choir room. 
Sam later invites Brittany to meet him at the auditorium, where she admits she staged her breakdown in order to have a more effective comeback, and tells him that she misses Santana. Sam tells Brittany that he will be her friend. Brittany later asks Sue to reinstate her on the Cheerios, and shows some marginal improvements on her grades. Sue agrees on the condition that Brittany's grades continue to improve so she can graduate.
The following day, Jake tells Marley he is going to join New Directions, and learns that he is now dating Kitty. Jake joins New Directions, and an upset Marley performs "Everytime" in the choir room. As this plays, Brittany pines alone in her bedroom for Santana who is offline on iChat, and Rachel paints over a drawing of Finn's name that she had made on her apartment's wall.
Production.
The episode is the second to feature the music of Britney Spears; the first was the second season's second episode, "Britney/Brittany", which remains one of the show's highest-rated episodes. It was initially reported on May 15, 2012, that this episode would feature eight of her songs; the report also noted that Spears was one of the new judges on the show that would be preceding "Glee" in its new Thursday night slot, "The X Factor".
In a July 2012 interview with "E! News", Colfer said he hoped to perform a song from Spears' 2011 album, "Femme Fatale", since he did not get to sing one of her songs during the show's first Spears tribute episode. Overstreet revealed that on July 22, 2012 he was recording for this episode. Overtstreet spoke to the same publication, "It's probably one of her most recent singles. We're doing a really cool version of it. It's going to be a little group number. It's going to be fun."
Eight songs featured in the episode have been released to iTunes as an extended play album entitled "Britney 2.0", though not also as individual singles. Details on most of these have been reported: Morris sings "Hold It Against Me" and "Gimme More" by Spears, Michele performs "Oops!... I Did It Again" as a big production number, McHale and Criss perform a mashup of "Boys" and Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend", a stripped-down acoustic version of Spears' "3" is performed by Ushkowitz, Overstreet and Larsen, "Everytime" is sung by Benoist, and a second mashup features "(You Drive Me) Crazy", called "U Drive Me Crazy", and Aerosmith's "Crazy", sung by Benoist and Artist. The eighth song is "Womanizer", performed by Newell, Benoist and Ushkowitz.
Returning recurring characters in this episode include special guest star Kate Hudson as NYADA dance instructor Cassandra July, McKinley's guidance counselor and Will's fiancée Emma Pillsbury (Mays), glee club members Joe Hart (Larsen), Wade "Unique" Adams (Newell) and Marley Rose (Benoist), new McKinley student Jake Puckerman (Artist), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), cheerleader Kitty (Tobin), NYADA upperclassman Brody Weston (Geyer), McKinley gossip blogger Jacob Ben Israel (Sussman), and Marley's mother (Stahl).
Reception.
Ratings.

Music and performances.
In December 2012, "TV Guide" named the mash-up "(You Drive Me) Crazy" / "Crazy" one of "Glee" best performances, with the periodical commenting: "Fortunately, the producers weren't afraid to infuse the hour with some classic Aerosmith, which made a memorable combination years after it seemed the best mash-ups were behind "Glee"" and calling the arrangement "beautiful".

The film surprised the critics as well as the audience as it was highly contrary to Upendra's earlier typically hero dominated dilogue oriented mass films. Rediff praised Upendra's performance in the film and also stated that "Gowramma is an impressively enjoyable film, and a heavily recommended watch". Other critics also acclaimed the film and praised Upendra's performance and stated that he looks different from his stereotype images in films such as "A" and "Upendra".
Box office.
"Gowramma" opened well at the box office despite Upendra's character in the film being very contrary to his dilogue oriented mass image. The film did good business at crucial circuits like Bangalore, Mysore, Hasan, Chitradurga, Davanagere and many other centers across Karnataka. However, the business in Bangalore was stronger with lots of family audience flocking to the theaters screening the film. "Gowramma" was one of the highest grossing Kannada films of 2005 and became the third consecutive successful film under Upendra - Naganna combination. It successfully completed 50 days in more than 17 centres across Karnataka and recorded 100 days in many centres across the state like Bangalore, Mysore, Davanagere, Shimoga, Mangalore, Hubli. The film was declared as a Super Hit.
Soundtrack.
S.A. Rajkumar scored the music for the film while Upendra and Kaviraj penned the lyrics.

Overly Dedicated

Overly Dedicated (stylized O(verly) D(edicated) and often referred to as O.D.) is the fourth mixtape by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar, released September 14, 2010, via Top Dawg Entertainment. The album features guest appearances from Dash Snow, Jhené Aiko, Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Dom Kennedy and MURS, among others. The album's production was handled by several TDE in-house producers, including King Blue, Sounwave, Tae Beast and Willie B; other producers such as Tommy Black, Drop, Jairus "J-Mo" Mozee, and Wyldfyer, also contributed production.
Background.
On September 4, 2010 Lamar unveiled the cover art for "Overly Dedicated", which was designed by RedefineCreativity. On September 14, 2010, the music video for "P&P 1.5", a song taken from "Overly Dedicated", featuring his Black Hippy cohort Ab-Soul, was released. On September 14, Lamar also released "Overly Dedicated" to digital retailers under the Top Dawg Entertainment, the label that signed after Lamar released his first mixtape, when he was 16. On September 23, it was released for free download online. 
"Overly Dedicated" includes a song titled "Ignorance Is Bliss", in which Lamar glorifies gangsta rap and street crime, but ends each verse with "ignorance is bliss", giving the message "we know not what we do". It was this song specifically that made fellow West Coast rapper and legendary hip hop producer Dr. Dre, want to work with Lamar, after watching the song's music video on YouTube. This led to Lamar working with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on Dre's "Detox" album and him considering signing to Dre's label, Aftermath Entertainment. On the topic of the project's genre, Lamar called it "human music".

Leccinum atrostipitatum

Description.
L. atrostipitatum a.k.a "Dark-Stalked Bolete" Caps are 7–20 cm across, convex, dry, minutely hairy to fibril-streaked, and buff to yellow-orange or ochre. Flesh is white, staining grey, then black. Tubes are grey-brown, staining as flesh. Pores are small, round and smokey to blackish-brown. Stalks are up to 20 cm tall by 3.5 cm wide, whitish, and with many raised, black dots. Spore print is yellow-brown to olive. Dark-Stalked Bolete fruits on the ground in mixed woods. Edible. George Barron: Mushrooms of Northeast North America
Leccinum is a genus of fungi in the family Boletaceae. It was the name given first to a series of fungi within the genus "Boletus", then erected as a new genus last century. Their main distinguishing feature is the small, rigid projections (scabers) that give a rough texture to their stalks. The genus name was coined from the Italian "Leccino", for a type of rough-stemmed bolete. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in north temperate regions, and contains about 75 species.
Ecology and habitat.
Dark-Stalked Boletes fruit on the ground in mixed woods. 
"Leccinum" species are generally found in the woodlands of Europe, Asia, and North America, forming ectomycorrhizal associations with trees. Most "Leccinum" species are mycorrhizal specialists, associating with trees of a single genus. "Leccinum aurantiacum" is an exception, however, occurring in mycorrhizal association with poplar, birch, and oak.
As food.
Leccinum atrostipitatum is edible and enjoyable, but do your homework and eat at your own risk. 
"Leccinum" species in general have been presumed to be edible for the most part, but there are reports of poisoning after eating as yet unidentified members of the genus in North America, even after thorough cooking. The orange- to red-capped species, including "L. insigne", are suspected. Species of "Leccinum" often cause nausea when consumed raw.
Cooking.
The key is preparation. A dry-saute is best. Clean and slice the mushrooms, then put them in a skillet on maximum heat with no butter or oil. sprinkle them with salt (to help draw out the moisture). Stir constantly until they begin to give off liquid, then let them cook in their own juices. After the liquid has evaporated (you can pour off some of it for use as stock), continue to cook them for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly again so they don't stick. Then turn down the heat, add a little olive oil or butter, and cook for another 5–10 minutes. They should be fairly chewy and full of flavor, not slimy, You can eat them as they are or incorporate them into any dish.

Michael Blakey (music producer)

Michael Blakey (born 8 December 1958, London, England) is a record producer, composer, musician, arranger, songwriter and artist manager. Blakey has either produced musical tracks or worked as a musician for a number of notable artists and performers, including: Engelbert Humperdinck, Luther Vandross, Gloria Gaynor, Tears for Fears, Dire Straits, Coolio, Akwid, Mary J. Blige, No Doubt, 2Pac, Eminem, Brian McKnight, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bob Carlisle, and Michelle Wright. He was also the drummer and composer for the 1990s rock band Tidal Force. As a producer, Blakey earned several gold and platinum records..
Early life and music career.
In 1978, while just 19 years of age, Blakey became resident producer at Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany - working with such artists as Boney M, Udo Lindenberg, Julio Iglesias and others. Shortly after, Blakey produced singles and LPs for various European musical acts, including multi-platinum selling artist Engelbert Humperdinck and the progressive rock band Phlox.
Later music career.
Blakey worked as a session recording drummer, composer and producer in the U.S. and U.K. throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, Blakey became a drummer and composer for the European rock band Tidal Force, which released the LP "Will To Power" on Atico Records in 1994. Tidal Force was known for their singles "Will to Power" and "A Man Rides Through".
In 1999, Blakey together with two partners, John Guidon and Bruce Gladstone founded a record label called 2KSounds. This was one of the first record companies to scout for as well as promote music on the internet. 
2KSounds had great success with one of these artists found on the internet named Brooke Allison. Due to this success, 2KSounds entered into a joint venture partnership with Virgin Records and Blakey became president of the Record Division.
Music production and management career.
Blakey produced several feature motion picture soundtracks, including the original musical soundtrack for Disney’s ', ' and "Shaft".
In early 2009, Blakey teamed up with Grammy Award-nominated comedian Ron White ("The Call MeTater Salad", "Blue Collar Comedy Tour") to form Organica Music Group, the media of which was distributed by Universal Music Group. OMG also produces feature motion pictures and television content and has worked with musical artists such as Margo Rey, Gladys Knight, and "Playboy" model Crystal Harris.
In 2009, Blakey formed Electra Star Management, based in West Hollywood, California. The company roster of talent includes: Academy Award-winning writer, actor and musician Billy Bob Thornton; actress Pamela Anderson (NBC’s "Baywatch"); ten times Grand Slam winning tennis player Jimmy Connors, touring comedian Ron White and Golden Globe Award nominated American actress, writer and comedian Brett Butler, famed for playing Grace Kelly on ABC's award winning TV Show Grace Under Fire and currently starring on FX Networks' Anger Management (TV series).
Discography.
Blakey's discography is listed below:
"Duets" music technology.
During his time at Platinum Records, Blakey worked with scientists to develop the primary technology for Forensic Frequency Separation Software. FFSS allows sound engineers to extract a specific vocal segment from a mono track by lifting the individual frequencies within the vocal and keeping it intact. Once extracted, the vocal track can be treated as a conventional vocal recording and placed onto a separate track in a contemporary high-definition recording format.
This innovation drove the creation of the Blakey-produced 1996 Patsy Cline "Duet" album by enabling contemporary vocalists to sing along with the original artist. While such critically acclaimed artists as Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson recorded new duets on the album, noted music historian and author of the book "Century of Country" Robert Oermann, reported that he was "not enthused by" the recordings, and would rather just "listen to Patsy. She doesn’t need anybody with her." Blakey countered, "Anybody who says this is the wrong thing to do, well, I don't think they're a true music lover."
Professional interests.
In September 1987, according to "The Motor" magazine, Blakey and three key British investors, John Bogg, David Osbourne and importer Colin Hayes, purchased luxury automotive company Maserati U.K. Ltd. for "under £3 million." It was sold to the Chrysler Corporation less than two years later.
In 2006, Blakey became co-owner responsible for "fleet growth" of Pylon International Inc., a private jet charter and service management company based in Van Nuys, California. Pylon was later acquired by IJM Holdings Corporation in August 2007.
Awards and Nominations.
Blakey won the "Melody Maker" Producer of the Year award in 1993 and was named promotion Man of the Year by "Music Beat" in 1995.

Ramsgate Stadium was a greyhound stadium that existed between 1928 and 1995.
The stadium first opened for racing on May 26, 1928 on Hereson Road, Dumpton Park and the first race went to Southern Surprise, a 4-1 chance.
The track remained a popular destination for holiday makers until 1976 when a former greyhound trainer and owner of independent track Doncaster, Mick Hawkins, bought the track. His company Hawkins of Harrow started a new company called Northern Sports and they introduced a major race in 1977 called the Thanet Gold Cup.
Just a year later, they purchased Oxford Stadium and revealed plans to invest heavily in both tracks. In 1984, under the Managing Director David Hawkins, the son of Mick Hawkins, they duly invested after gaining planning permission and incorporated a leisure complex on site. The track became a prominent venue and business boomed.
In 1991, the track secured a lucrative BAGS (Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service) contract but when parent company Hawkins of Harrow ran into trouble due to the building recession in 1995 the receivers took over Northern Sports.
Sadly the track did not stay open for business and the site was redeveloped.

<doc id="36740559" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36740559" title="Petit Bouschet">
Petit Bouschet

Petit Bouschet is a red "teinturier" grape variety that is a crossing of Aramon noir and Teinturier du Cher created in 1824 by French grape breeder Louis Bouschet at his vineyard in Mauguio in the Hérault department. The grape was used by Louis' son, Henri Bouschet, to create several more varieties including Alicante Bouschet, Grand Noir de la Calmette and Morrastel Bouschet. Petit Bouschet saw a surge of plantings in the late 19th century as France recovered from the phylloxera epidemic where it was often used to add color to blends made from hybrid grapes and other high yielding varieties. As its offspring Alicante Bouschet became more popular, plantings of Petit Bouschet fell off and the grape is now hardly found in France. 
History and relationship to other grapes.
Petit Bouschet was created in 1824 by grape breeder Louis Bouschet at his Domaine de la Camette vineyard and breeding station near Montpellier in southern France. The grape is a crossing of two "Vitis vinifera" varieties, Aramon noir and the red-flesh Teinturier du Cher. This makes Petit Bouschet a crossing and not a hybrid grape which would have parents from two difference species from the "Vitis" genus. While Aramon noir is like most red-skinned "Vitis vinifera" varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, in having white flesh which yields white or greyish color juice when pressed soon after harvest, Petit Bouschet inherited red-flesh from Teinturier du Cher. This means that Petit Bouschet can produce red colored wine without needing long periods of skin contact to leach out the color compounds from the grape skins into the wine.
Louis Bouschet's son, Henri, would use Petit Bouschet to breed several more crossings including Alicante Bouschet (with Grenache), Grand Noir de la Calmette (with Aramon) and Morrastel Bouschet (with Graciano). In the early 21st century, some ampelographers suspected that Petit Bouschet may have been a parent vine for the Provençal wine grape Téoulier but DNA profiling has disproved that suggestion. The grape was also historically associated with the Galician wine grape Juan García dues to the similarities in synonyms, particularly with Petit Bouschet also being known as Negrón de Aldán in the "Denominación de Origen" (DO) region of Bierzo. However, DNA evidence has also dispelled any link between the two varieties.
Viticulture.
Petit Bouschet is a early to mid-ripening variety that also buds early which can make it prone to damage from early spring frost in some areas. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and green harvesting. Petit Bouschet also has a tendency to produce numerous basal shoots that grow on the trunk of the grapevine below the cordons. Also known as "suckers", these shoots can sap the vine of nutritional and water resources that would otherwise be funneled into developing and ripening the grape clusters and will need to be removed throughout the growing season. Other viticultural hazards that Petit Bouschet is susceptible to include infection from erinose mites.
Wine regions.
Petit Bouschet was widely planted throughout the southern wine regions of France in the late 19th century but today it is hardly found in the country with its offspring, Alicante Bouschet, largely taking over its role of adding color to wine blends. There are some plantings of the grape in North Africa, particularly Algeria, and in 2009 there were of the Petit Bouschet growing in Portugal.
Synonyms.
Over the years, Petit Bouschet has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Aramon-Teinturier, Bouschet, Bouschet de Bernard, Bouschet Petit, Le Bouschet, Negrón de Aldán (in Bierzo region in Spain), Petit Bouse, Pit Bushe and Tintinha (in Portugal).

87th New York State Legislature

The 87th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 5 to April 23, 1864, during the second year of Horatio Seymour's second tenure as Governor of New York, in Albany.
Background.
Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county. 
At this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Democrats split over the civil war issue. The "War Democrats" and the Republicans formed a coalition known as the "Republican Union," and supported President Abraham Lincoln and the Union Army's war effort; the rump Democratic Party opposed the war, favoring a compromise with the South, and became known as "Peace Democrats" or "Copperheads."
Elections.

Pro.Mecc Sparviero

The Pro.Mecc Sparviero () is an Italian ultralight aircraft, designed and produced by Pro.Mecc of Corigliano d'Otranto. The Sparviero is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.
Design and development.
The Sparviero was designed to conform to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.
The Sparviero is made predominantly from carbon fibre, with the wing skins fabricated from fibreglass. Its span wing has an area of and flaps. The standard engine fitted is the Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplant, with the Rotax 912UL optional. In 2011 a fast-build kit was introduced that provides a completed and painted fuselage and wings, requiring the builder only to carry out the engine and electrical installations.
The Sparviero was later developed into the Pro.Mecc Freccia Anemo, with additional streamlining and a new elliptical planform wing.

Sülde Tngri

Sülde Tngri is an equestrian war god, one of the tngri, the highest group of divinities in Mongolian shamanism. He is usually depicted as an armored warrior riding a horse. In Mongolian shamanism, everyone possesses a guardian spirit, called a sülde. "Sülde Tngri" can refer to the sülde of any great leader, but it primarily refers to the deified sülde of Genghis Khan. As a war god, Sülde Tngri's primary function is protecting his devotees from their enemies and aiding them in battles against their foes.
Descriptions and appearance.
The exact details of Sülde Tngri's appearance and entourage vary among artwork of him. He has been illustrated as a man wearing armor and a helmet adorned by triangular flags or banners, armed with a club and wreathed in fire. He is mounted on a yellow horse, tended to by a servant clothed in white. In this portrayal, he has a demon held captive. Another description has Sülde Tngri clothed in white silk and carrying both a spear and a lance, riding a white horse. In other images, he has been represented by a man with a spear and a flag, riding a horse.
Rituals and symbolism.
Sülde Tngri's primary sphere of influence is protection from mortal enemies. Rituals invoking his aid usually describe him and his entourage only briefly, but some give more elaborate, detailed accounts of his interventions. He is the major local god around the Muna community, although his status as a minor god elsewhere is simultaneously acknowledged.
Association with Genghis Khan.
Sülde Tngri is most often identified with Genghis Khan. As his sülde, Sülde Tngri represents the embodiment of Genghis Khan in his martial character, excluding the other aspects of the historical figure's personality. The white horse that sometimes appears in descriptions of Sülde Tngri has been thought to represent Genghis's deified horse. In illustrations, the god and the mortal man resemble each other; this has created some confusion over which entity is being portrayed. Sülde Tngri is also sometimes confused with similar equestrian warrior deities, such as Dayisun Tngri.

The Best of Men

The Best of Men is a factually based 2012 television film which describes the pioneering work of Dr. Ludwig Guttmann with paraplegic patients, which led to the foundation of the Paralympic Games, starring Eddie Marsan and Rob Brydon.
Plot.
Ludwig Guttmann (Marsan) is a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, sponsored to stay in the United Kingdom by CARA, while his patients were injured British servicemen, initially bewildered at finding themselves under the care of one of "the enemy".
On arrival at the hospital, the patients are kept under sedation, and immobile in bed, a regime leading to bedsores, infection, and, in many cases, death. Dr Guttman insists that the best prognosis for the patients is if they are as mobile as possible. This leads him to clash with the existing staff of nurses and doctors at the hospital, who are accustomed to merely managing the decline of their patients.
As he gradually wins the staff over with his determination and optimism, Guttmann faces a further problem in the hopelessness of some of the patients, particularly exemplified by the youngest inmate, William Heath (MacKay), who joined the army from school. William's despair is contrasted with irrepressible humour of veteran Wynn Bowen (Brydon), who offers a constant series of irreverent comments from his bed.
Guttman hits on competitive exercise and sport as a way of both encouraging physical exercise and building self-esteem. Now in wheelchairs, the patients compete at hockey and basketball, and begin to re-connect to the outside world. The patients visit a local pub and challenge the regulars to arm-wrestling. The previously suicidal William engages in sport so enthusiastically that he breaks a leg, to the consternation of the other medical staff. Wynn is scheduled for a reunion with his wife in Wales, although this makes his composure crack over worries about his sexual performance. After Dr Guttman tells him "there is more than one way to skin a cat", he returns, jubilantly proclaiming that he "skinned the cat!".
The film closes with captions describing how the Stoke Mandeville Games became the Paralympics, and how Dr Gutmann was awarded a knighthood.
Production.
Written by Lucy Gannon, the show was produced by Whitby Davison for the BBC.
Location.
One of the locations used was St Swithuns quad at Magdalen College Oxford. Ludwig's son Dennis was an undergraduate at Magdalen 1947=52.

Ola Kvernberg

Ola Kvernberg (born 16 June 1981 in Fræna, Norway) is a Norwegian jazz musician (violin) known for his virtuosic string swing violin playing and his international performances. He is the son of traditional musicians Liv Rypdal Kvernberg and Torbjørn Kvernberg, and the brother of traditional musicians Kari Kvernberg Dajani and fiddler Jorun Marie Kvernberg, and grandson of the fiddler and traditional music composer Peter L. Rypdal. Kvernberg studied classical violin from the age of nine, and won 3rd price in a great classical violin competition in Italy when he was fourteen.
String swing with "Hot Club de Norvège".
Kvernberg began to play folk music at a young age and was classically trained through the municipal music school. His first record release was with the band "Fear of flying" in 1995. Two years later, when he was 16, he began playing jazz, and was educated on the Jazz program at "Trondheim musikkonservatorium" (2001–03).
Kvernberg spontaneously became known after a meeting with "Hot Club de Norvège" in 2000 during the annual "Django Festival" in Oslo, where he actually jammed with Toots Thielemans. This gave rise to release album "Hot Club de Norvege presenting Ola Kvernberg & Jimmy Rosenberg" (2000), the solo release "Ola Kvernberg" (2001), as well as participation on the record "Angelo is back in town" with Angelo Debarre (2001), which he also played with at the "Django Festival" in January 2002. In April 2002, Ola was soloist on Jon Larsen's jazz symphony "White Night Stories", together with Hot Club de Norvège and Tromsø Symphony Orchestra, and on two recordings with this project.
__NOTOC__
His own trio.
Ola Kvernberg Trio with Steinar Raknes (bass) and Doug Raney (guitar) released the album "Cats & Doug" (Hot Club Records, 2002). 
Erik Nylander (drums) replaced Raney on the production of Eboue Seck's "Wolof Experience" at
(Moldejazz 2005). On Vossajazz 2006, they play with Vidar Busk, accompanied by Håkon Mjåset Johansen (drums). The trio (with Nylander/Raknes) released the album "Night" (Jazzland, 2006) with the Kvernberg's own compositions. " People" was published in 2009. The commissioned work "Liarbird" to the Jazz 2010 was released. For the record "Liarbird" he won the Spellemannprisen 2011 in the class jazz.
Other cooperations.
He played with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen and Philip Catherine at Moldejazz 2004, and was involved in the Ingebrigt Håker Flaten Quintet, the trio "Gammalgrass" with Stian Carstensen and Ole Morten Vågan, in "The Scarlatti Ensemble" with Kim Myhr, Eirik Hegdal and Marianne Baudouin Lie, with Siri Gjære's "Trønderhøns" and as a guest in "Banjovi" with Finn Guttormsen, Stian Carstensen, Haakon Askeland, Kjartan Iversen and Knut Hem. In 2007 he was with Thomas Dybdahl on tour. In 2008 Kvernberg contributed on the Jon Larsen's "The Jimmy Carl Black Story".
He is portrayed in the Stein Kagge's book "Fra Satchmo til Ola Kvernberg" (2001), and he is the brother of traditional musician Jorun Marie Kvernberg (1979).

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission or WMATC is a regulatory agency established by the Washington Metropolitan Area Regulation Compact, an interstate compact established between the Commonwealth of Virginia, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, and consented to by Congress under Public Law 86-794 in 1960 to regulate passenger common carriers operating within the District of Columbia, and the suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. A common carrier desiring to offer passenger carriage for hire within the region must register with the commission and obtain a WMATC number. This includes public bus systems owned by cities and counties within the region if managed and operated by a private company. Carriers operating exclusively within Virginia are exempt from registration with WMATC as they would register with the Virginia Corporation Commission.
Registration.
Being authorized to operate by the commission and issued a WMATC number means the organization does not have to register as a common carrier with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, the Virginia Corporation Commission, the Maryland Public Service Commission or the U.S. Department of Transportation. It serves as a single registration point for passenger common carriers operating within the District of Columbia, Prince Georges and Montgomery County in Maryland, and carriers operating in interstate commerce within the region from Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William Counties and Fairfax, Alexandria, Manassas, Manassas Park, Falls Church and Leesburg Cities in Virginia.
Requirements.
The general requirement to obtain a WMATC number is similar to the U.S. Department of Transportation's requirement to obtain a DOT number, or most state Public Utilities Commissions to obtain a state registration number: submit a set of tariffs stating prices for services, pay a fee of about $500, and provide evidence of either a minimum of $1.5 million in insurance for carriers operating vehicles having 15 passengers or less (including the driver), or at least $5 million in insurance for carriers operating vehicles which can carry more than 15 persons.
As with any other registration system, the carrier posts their number on the outside of their vehicles in the form "WMATC 126".
WMATC should not be confused with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) which is the bus and train operator for the City of Washington and suburbs. WMATA is also exempt from regulation by WMATC.

<doc id="36740699" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36740699" title="Position and momentum space">
Position and momentum space

In physics and geometry, there are two intertwined vector spaces.
Position space (also real space or coordinate space) is the set of all position vectors r of an object in space (usually 3D). The position vector defines a point in space. If the position vector varies with time it will trace out a path or surface, such as the trajectory of a particle. 
Momentum space or k-space is the set of all wavevectors k, associated with particles - free and bound. The terms "momentum" (symbol p, also a vector) and "wavevector" are used interchangeably due to the De Broglie relation p = "ħ"k, meaning they are equivalent up to proportionality, although this is not true in a crystal, see below. 
This is an example of "Pontryagin duality".
The position vector r has dimensions of length, the k-vector has dimensions of reciprocal length, so k is the frequency analogue of r, just as angular frequency ω is the inverse quantity and frequency analogue of time "t". Physical phenomena can be described using either the positions of particles, or their momenta, both formulations equivalently provide the same information about the system in consideration. Usually r is more intuitive and simpler than k, though the converse is also true, such as in solid-state physics.
Position and momentum spaces in quantum mechanics.
In quantum physics, a particle is described by a quantum state. This quantum state can be represented as a superposition (i.e. a linear combination as a weighted sum) of basis states. In principle one is free to choose the set of basis states, as long as they span the space. If one chooses the eigenfunctions of the position operator as a set of basis functions, one speaks of a state as a wave function ψ(r) in position space (our ordinary notion of space in terms of length). The familiar Schrödinger equation in terms of the position r is an example of quantum mechanics in the position representation.
By choosing the eigenfunctions of a different operator as a set of basis functions, one can arrive at a number of different representations of the same state. If one picks the eigenfunctions of the momentum operator as a set of basis functions, the resulting wave function φ(k) is said to be the wave function in momentum space.
Relation between space and reciprocal space.
The momentum representation of a wave function is very closely related to the Fourier transform and the concept of frequency domain. Since a quantum mechanical particle has a frequency proportional to the momentum (de Broglie's equation given above), describing the particle as a sum of its momentum components is equivalent to describing it as a sum of frequency components (i.e. a Fourier transform). This becomes clear when we ask ourselves how we can transform from one representation to another.
Functions and operators in position space.
Suppose we have a three-dimensional wave function in position space ψ(r), then we can write this functions as a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions ψ"j"(r):
or, in the continuous case, as an integral
It is clear that if we specify the set of functions ψ"j"(r), say as the set of eigenfunctions of the momentum operator, the function φ(k) holds all the information necessary to reconstruct ψ(r) and is therefore an alternative description for the state ψ.
In quantum mechanics, the momentum operator is given by
(see matrix calculus for the denominator notation) with appropriate domain. The eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues "ħ"k. So
and we see that the momentum representation is related to the position representation by a Fourier transform.
Functions and operators in momentum space.
Conversely, a three-dimensional wave function in momentum space φ(k) as a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions φ"j"(k):
or as an integral:
the position operator is given by
with eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues r. So a similar decomposition of φ(k) can be made in terms of the eigenfunctions of this operator, which turns out to be the inverse Fourier transform:
Unitary equivalence between position and momentum operator.
The r and p operators are unitarily equivalent, with the unitary operator being given explicitly by the Fourier transform. Thus they have the same spectrum. In physical language, p acting on momentum space wave functions is the same as r acting on position space wave functions (under the image of the Fourier transform).
Reciprocal space and crystals.
For an electron (or other particle) in a crystal, its value of k relates almost always to its crystal momentum, not its normal momentum. Therefore k and p are not simply proportional but play different roles. See k·p perturbation theory for an example. Crystal momentum is like a wave envelope that describes how the wave varies from one unit cell to the next, but does "not" give any information about how the wave varies within each unit cell.
When k relates to crystal momentum instead of true momentum, the concept of k-space is still meaningful and extremely useful, but it differs in several ways from the non-crystal k-space discussed above. For example, in a crystal's k-space, there is an infinite set of points called the reciprocal lattice which are "equivalent" to k = 0 (this is analogous to aliasing). Likewise, the "first Brillouin zone" is a finite volume of k-space, such that every possible k is "equivalent" to exactly one point in this region.
For more details see reciprocal lattice.

Powder River Station-Powder River Crossing

The Powder River Crossing, officially known as Powder River Station-Powder River Crossing (48JO134 and 48JO801), is an abandoned settlement located on the east bank of the Powder River in southeast Johnson County about twenty-four miles east of Kaycee, Wyoming. The Powder River Crossing was a stage stop on the Bozeman Trail, and it is notable for its well-preserved wagon ruts.
Cantonment Reno.
Powder River Crossing was a civilian settlement that grew up on the Bozeman Trail, across the Powder River from Cantonment Reno. Cantonment Reno was established in late 1876, three miles upstream from the site of Fort Reno, a fort that was established in 1865 and abandoned in 1868 under the terms of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. 
By 1878, Cantonment Reno was experiencing a shortage of lumber, forage and water. The army decided to relocate the fort to Fort McKinney, about 45 miles northwest near the present-day site of Buffalo, Wyoming. By the end of 1878, all the soldiers were gone except for a smail detail who looked after the abandoned buildings and ran the telegraph station.
Stage Stop.
The army built a military road and telegraph line along the Bozeman Trail in 1877 and 1878. Soldiers from Cantonment Reno completed a wooden bridge at the Powder River Crossing on April 6, 1877. 
In April 1979, the Patrick Brothers Stage Line began thrice weekly regular service between Fort Fetterman and Etchetah, Montana on the Bozeman Trail. Powder River Crossing was the fifth stage stop after Fort Fetterman. On May 13, 1879, the army allowed the old sutler's store and one of the cavalry stables from Cantonment Reno to be used as a store and eating house at Powder River Crossing. An English traveler stayed at the store on August 30, 1880, and left a description:
"This is a deserted Fort...The log huts, built in a large square, are still standing. Frewen's store is in one of them, and there are two or three bedrooms there, rather rough and ready, one of which I secured...I was very tired towards night, and turned in early-no sheets-only a pair of blankets to get between, but I was soon asleep notwithstanding."
In January 1880, the Rock Creek Stage Company moved another log cavalry stable from the old cantonment to a point east of the Powder River along the Dry Fork. They also built several other buildings including a new stage stop. The stage station was eventually made up of a large, long building (store, saloon, and living quarters in one) along with stables, a blacksmith shop, and numerous old dugout cabins. The amenities included fresh horses, tobacco, whiskey, and prostitutes. From 1882 to 1891, William P. Hathaway ran the store and saloon which was located directly east of the dry gulch at the end of the little patch of timber."
Amanda and Horace Brown ran the stage stop at Powder River Crossing from 1884 until 1887. Her memoirs appeared in the October 1958 issue of Colorado Magazine:
"We made good money, but I sure worked myself down. I cooked for all the way from ten to forty people, did all my washing, cleaned the rooms, and waited on people. We kept the stage people. I always had to be ready for a stage full, and sometimes it was only the drivers. There were all the different people which make up a new country traveling on the road - ranchmen, cowboys, gamblers, horse thieves, and occasionally stage robbers."
According to Brown, a small community grew up around the stage station, and the iron bridge that was built in 1883. There were never more than four families at Powder River Crossing, but the amenities includes a store, a post office, and a saloon. When the Burlington Railroad reached Clearmont, Wyoming in 1892, the stage line was no longer needed.
Abandonment.
The post office at Powder River was established on May 22, 1879 with John Livingston as the first postmaster.
In 1881, Henry Winter ("Hard Winter") Davis, established the Spectacle Ranch near the present site of Sussex, Wyoming. The post office at Powder River Crossing moved to the Davis ranch on October 18, 1895. The road that ran down the Dry Fork was rerouted to cross the Powder River at Sussex, and it eventually became Wyoming Highway 192. In 1914, a new bridge and post office were built at Sussex (Sussex Post Office and Store), and this spelled the end of Powder River Crossing.
Present Status.
The area at Powder River Crossing was never homesteaded, and it is owned by the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments, an agency of the State of Wyoming.

Cibicides

Cibicides is a cosmopolitan genus of benthic foraminifera known from at least as far back as the Paleocene (Loelich & Tappan, 1988) that extends down to the present. 
The test, or shell, of Cibicides, which is commonly found attached, is mutlichambered, plano-convex, trochospiral, with a flat or dished-out evolute spiral side and a strongly arched, involute umbilical side. The test wall is calcareous, perforate, bilamellar, with a radial microstructure. The flat or nearly flat spiral side is coarsely perforate while the arched umbilical side is finely perforate. The apertural face and peripheral keel, where the two faces meet, are imperforate. Sutures on the spiral side are thickened and may be elevated, but are narrow and depressed on the ubilical side. The aperture a low interio-marginal equatorial opening that extends a short dis­tance onto the umbilical side but continues along the spiral suture on the spiral side.
"Cibicides", named by Montfort, 1808, is included in the subfamily Cbicidinae, family Cibicididae, superfamily Planorbulinacea; suborder Rotaliina in Loeblich and Tappan, 1987 and order Rotaliida in Loeblack and Tappan, 1992. It was put, instead, in the Orbitoidacea in Loeblcih and Tappan, 1964, in the Treatise Part C, and in the Anomalinidae in Cushman, 1950.

Puerto Rican constitutional referendum, 2012

A constitutional referendum was held in Puerto Rico on 19 August 2012. Voters were asked whether they approve of two amendments to the constitution; one to eliminate the absolute right to bail and the other to decrease the number of members of the Legislative Assembly. Despite support from the party in government and part of the main opposition party, both amendments were rejected by voters.
Background.
On January 9, 2012, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Fortuño signed the project for a Legislative Reform that would reduce the number of legislators. According to Fortuño, this would result in a decrease in the expenses associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has to be amended, which would require a referendum to the people.
On May 10, 2012, the Senate approved a resolution that proposed another amendment to the Constitution, this time to eliminate the absolute right to bail, specifically in murder cases, and others. Governor Fortuño signed the resolution on May 15, agreeing to hold the referendum for both constitutional amendments on August 19, 2012.
Former Governors Rafael Hernández Colón, Carlos Romero Barceló, and Pedro Rosselló, had tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the absolute right for bail during their tenures. Rosselló was the only one to hold a referendum in 1994, but people voted against the amendment.
Proposed amendments.
Article III.
The first amendment applies to Article III, Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7. It proposes to reduce the members of the Legislative Assembly from 78 to 56. Specifically:
This would require increasing the amount of senatorial districts from 8 to 11, while reducing the representative districts from 40 to 33.
Article II.
The second amendment applies to Article II, Sections 11. It proposes to eliminate the absolute right to bail, specifically in cases of those accused of:
In those cases, the judge will have the discretion of conceding or denying bail, after evaluating if the accused represents a risk to others or to the case.
Voting process.
Both proposed amendments were presented to the voters in a ballot, with two questions. Each question asked if they approved the proposed amendment, to which the voters answered in a "Yes" or "No" checkbox to each question. Each ballot also presented the proposed amendment as it would have been featured in the Constitution of Puerto Rico, if it had won.
The ballot format was criticized by various groups, who considered it "difficult to read", according to José Acarón, state director of the AARP. Roberto Aponte, electoral commissioner for the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) also stated that the ballot would be "troublesome to read". Ramón Jiménez, director of the referendum scrutiny, assured that the ballot was readable, but also said that voting colleges would have enlarged ballots for anyone who needed them.
Prisons in Puerto Rico held the voting process for the referendum on August 17, 2012 with approximately 8,350 of 11,800 prisoners participating. Former Speaker of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and convict Edison Misla Aldarondo voted in a Bayamón prison. He said to a newspaper that he voted in favor of eliminating the absolute right for bail because "it is a mechanism to deal with the crime situation." However, he voted against the proposed Legislative Reform saying that "quality and quantity are two different things".
On August 19, 2012, 3,151 voting colleges opened at 8:00am and closed at 3:00pm.
Campaign.
Opponents.
Reaction to the proposed amendments was mixed, with several groups deciding to campaign against them answering "No" to each question. A coalition group called "Frente Amplio de Puerto Rico: Mesa Amplia de Diálogo" decided to campaign against both amendments and declared August 17, 2012 to be the "Day of No and No". The group is formed by new parties Movimiento Unión Soberanista (MUS), Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party (PPR), and the Worker's People Party of Puerto Rico (PPT), along with groups like the Alianza Pro Libre Asociación Soberana (ALAS), Church's Council, and the Ecumenic Coalition.
The Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) is campaigning against both amendments, arguing that the proposed Legislative Reform would "crush minorities" by increasing the amount of votes that minority candidates would need to be elected. Several weeks before the referendum, they also argued that there was still confusion among the voters, and that electoral participation will be around 20%.
Héctor Pesquera, co-president of the Hostosian National Independence Movement (MINH) asked people to vote against the amendments arguing that eliminating the absolute right to bail won't be a solution to the rising crime rate in the island. The members of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, one of the main cultural institutions of the island, also wrote a statement against the amendments calling them an "attempt on people's rights".
Various leaders within the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) campaigned against the amendments. Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá posted a video on his blog in which he asked people to vote "No". The former President of the Senate, Miguel Hernández Agosto, and former gubernatorial candidate, Victoria Muñoz Mendoza, also stated their opposition to the amendments. Current candidates Rafael Cox Alomar, Eduardo Bhatia and Carmen Yulín Cruz also said they were against the amendments, despite the position of the president of the party and current gubernatorial candidate Alejandro García Padilla to vote in favor.
Human rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano expressed himself against the amendments, arguing that the problem wasn't the bail, but rather that "7 out of 10 cases are solved". He also offered statistics from the Legal Assistance Association that showed that, out of 100 persons accused of murder during a year, only eight received the benefit of freedom while awaiting their trial.
The Puerto Rico Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (PRACDL) also expressed themselves against the amendments. In their statement, they argued that "preventive detention hasn't contributed to make Puerto Rico, or United States, a safer place for their citizens, nor does it contribute to a culture of respect to the rights of others."
On August 2012, Puerto Rican singer/actor Ricky Martin posted on his website "To amend the Constitution goes beyond party ideologies. Don't let fear and frustration decide your vote. The rights we already have shouldn't be relinquished." René Pérez, from Calle 13, also invited people to vote "No" to the amendments. Pérez wrote on his Facebook page "You wouldn't amputate an arm or a leg, unless it was to save your life. The same happens with freedom. The right for bail is part of it. You shouldn't vote to have a part of you amputated. Think. If one day you're wrongly accused, you should have the right to be free while you wait to prove it" and added "Limit the weapons, not our rights."
A group of artists under the name of "Artistas en Defensa al Derecho a la Fianza" also made statements against the proposed amendments to the Constitution. The group, led by actor Luis Enrique Romero, included artists from several branches like actresses Ineabelle Colón, Amneris Morales, Magali Carrasquillo, and Anamín Santiago; folk singers José Antonio "Tony Mapeyé" Rivera and Eduardo Villanueva; singers/musicians Irvin García and Pepe Sánchez; painter Pablo Marcano, and photographer Félix Guayciba. During a press conference, actress Amneris Morales called the current government "a dictatorship", while fellow actress Carrasquillo argued that "not everybody will be accused with the same severity".
The parents of Karla Michelle Negrón, a 15-year old girl that was killed by a stray bullet during New Year's Eve, said they would vote against the amendments, stating that it "simplifies a bigger problem" and that it "won't help fight against crime".
Proponents.
Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned in favor of the proposed amendments. Most of the leaders of the party support him and will campaign with him. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote in favor of the amendments. Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made statements in favor of the amendments. The group, led by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F. Méndez (Treasury), Henry Neumann (Sports and Recreation), and Jesús González (Correction).
Alejandro García Padilla, current senator and gubernatorial candidate for the opposing Popular Democratic Party (PPD), also expressed he would vote in favor of the amendments. His posture came as a surprise, since he voted against the resolution in the Senate of Puerto Rico. He said that "with the referendum already approved and in the absence of other legislative mechanisms like the ones we have proposed during this term to fight against crime, I express myself in favor of this amendment and I will vote accordingly." Former governors Sila María Calderón and Rafael Hernández Colón expressed themselves in favor of the amendments, along with other members of the party like Sila María González Calderón, Luis Raúl Torres Cruz, Jorge Colberg Toro, and others.
A group of judges, including Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former judge of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves in favor of the amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow judges to define the issue of the dangerousness of the accused.
Astrologer Walter Mercado said on a statement that he favored both amendments to the Constitution. He wrote that he considered the amendment on the right to bail to be an important tool on the fight against crime, and that it was "a step ahead in the control of the rising crime rate." He added that the amendment would "protect good and decent people from criminals that used their time on bail to threaten witnesses and commit more crimes."
Adverts.
The New Progressive Party (PNP) published advertisements in favor of the amendments using the pictures of two young men recently accused of murder. The pictures, taken after their arrests, show both men with their middle fingers to the camera. The advertisement reads "If you don't vote, they win". The mother of one of the men in the picture, Vilmarie Carrasquillo, presented a preliminary injunction to withdraw the advertisement, arguing that his son's right for privacy was violated. However, the San Juan Court determined that the PNP could continue using the advertisement. Two days before the referendum, the Supreme Court ratified the decision of the Court of San Juan allowing the PNP to continue with their campaign.
Opinion polls.
A poll by local newspaper "El Nuevo Día" was published on August 12, 2012. The poll had the following results:
The poll, which was designed and analyzed by Kaagan Research Associates, included a sample of 1,000 people and could produce an error of ±3%.
Results.
The first preliminary results were announced by the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced that there was a tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said "It's not what we expected, it's different to our projections, and we have to accept it." However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. The results on the absolute bail bill means that "Puerto Rico remains the only place in the Western Hemisphere where everyone is entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime."
The final results, according to the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico, were:
Aftermath.
At 7:00pm, Governor Luis Fortuño held a press conference, along with Pedro Pierluisi, where he conceded the defeat of the "Yes" camp. In his message, he said that "this isn't about one party or one government" and assured those that supported him that they would keep on working "outside of party lines, so that everyone can be part of the solution". On the other hand, Senator and PPD gubernatorial candidate Alejandro García Padilla blamed Fortuño and Pierluisi for the loss during a press conference.
At the Puerto Rico Bar Association, groups that were against the amendments started celebrating the preliminary results. Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá celebrated the victory saying that "reason triumphed over fear and money". The PIP gubernatorial candidate Juan Dalmau Ramírez said that the defeat represented a "moral defeat" for both Fortuño and García Padilla.

Moses Simwala

Moses Simwala (16 July 1949 – 19 September 1993) was a Zambian footballer and coach. Nicknamed ‘the Chairman,’ Simwala featured for Zambia and Rhokana United (later Nkana Red Devils and now Nkana F.C.) as a right winger, the same club he would go on to coach for over 12 years and become the most successful coach in Zambian club football, winning the league title a record 8 times and 21 trophies in all. He was voted Zambian coach of the year in 1988 and 1989.
Early life.
Simwala was born Moses Jimwala in Kitwe to Katontoka and Belita Jimwala who originated from the North-Western Province of Zambia and settled in the Copperbelt town of Kalulushi, after which the family name changed to Simwala. He was the third born of six sons and three daughters and played with home-made footballs with his friends at Twibukishe open grounds. He went to Wusaklie Primary School in 1959 and later moved to Nkana Primary School from where he was selected to Luanshimba Secondary School in 1966. His favourite subjects were chemistry and health sciences and he completed his secondary school education in 1970.
Playing career.
Simwala started playing football for the school team at Luanshimba in 1966, the same year in which he joined Rhokana United. He was encouraged by the support from teammates Freddie Mwila, Stone Chibwe and Henry Kalimukwa who gave him advice and guidance in football.
The following year, he was selected to represent Zambia schools alongside players like George Mungwa, Peter M’hango, Richard Stephenson, Gibby Zulu, Edward Musonda, Emmanuel Mwape, Willie Phiri, Poni ‘Express’ Muyambango and Ackim Musenge.
Simwala was a skilful right winger with pace to burn and in his time at Rokana, he won the Challenge Cup in 1966 and the Heinrich (Chibuku) Cup in 1969, providing the cross for Eric Chekeloko’s winner in a 1-0 victory over Mufulira Wanderers in Ndola. Playing alongside Zambian international stars Bernard Chanda and Brighton Sinyangwe, he won the Heinrich (Chibuku) Cup again in 1974. In October 1977, Chanda was suspended by the club for disciplinary reasons and Simwala replaced him as club captain. In December 1980, he decided to call time on his playing career and took up coaching.
National Team.
Simwala first featured for the Zambian national team in October 1969 against Congolese club Daring Falcons in a three match series for the BAT Independence trophy, while he was still a schoolboy. His full international debut came a year later in a CAN qualifier against Tanzania in Dar es Salaam. His first goal for Zambia was in April 1973 when Zambia beat Ethiopia 4-2 in a World Cup qualifier in Lusaka. Six months later, Simwala was on the score sheet again when Zambia beat Morocco 4-0 in another World Cup qualifier in Lusaka, a match which he rated as one of his most memorable games.
He was a squad member at CAN 1974 where Zambia reached the final only to lose to Zaire after a replay. When Dick Chama retired, Simwala was named captain and he led Zambia to the 1976 East and Central Africa football tournament where they lost the final 2-0 to Uganda. He was part of Zambia’s Olympic Games squad at Moscow 1980 and played all three games as Zambia bowed out in the first round. His last game for Zambia came on 12 December 1980 in a 1-1 draw with Kenya during that country’s Independence celebrations after which he announced his retirement from football to leave room to young players and took up the coaching job at Rhokana stadium.
Coaching career.
In 1980, Simwala was appointed Rhokana United (who were by then renamed Nkana Red Devils) coach under Englishman Jeff Butler. His first success was the 1982 Zambian league title when Nkana finished the season unbeaten in 22 league games. It was the first time the Red Devils had won the league and it would be the first of 8 titles under Simwala.
The Devils retained the title the following year and lost it in 1984 to bitter Kitwe rivals Power Dynamos but made up the following year. With 4 games to go, Simwala was sidelined and replaced by Butler as coach for the remaining 4 league games, after a poor run by the devils and the team responded by beating Power 2-0 at their home ground in the last game of the season and snatched the title by a point.
Simwala bounced back the following season and led Nkana to the 1986 title once again and though Nkana had done well in the league under Simwala, they had had a dismal run in cup competitions. This changed in 1986 when they won the Zambian Cup for the first time ever, beating record cup holders Mufulira Wanderers 3-0. This was also Nkana’s first cup success since 1969 and they added the Champion of Champions cup later that year. Simwala was rewarded with a coach of the year nomination but lost out to Roy Mulenga of Division I side ZESCO United, who uttered some unfavourable comments about Simwala when fans questioned his credentials for winning the award.
Nkana followed this up with another league title in 1988 and completely cast aside any doubts as to whether they were the dominant team in Zambian soccer. Also known as the ‘Clampers,’ playing Nkana at their home ground Nkana Stadium was a daunting undertaking and few teams came away with anything. That year's league title was even more impressive considering that seven senior players were suspended for a reasonable part of the season for refusing to sing the national anthem after losing the Heroes and Unity Cup to Green Buffaloes in a final which was played at Nkana Stadium.They would go on to win the league in 1989 and 1990 and also represented Zambia in continental competitions, often reaching the Africa Club Champions Cup quarter-finals and semi-finals.
In 1990, Simwala attended a 3 month coaching course in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where he had the opportunity of meeting Pele who lectured the attendees and gave them tips. Later that year, he scored another achievement when he led Nkana to the final of the Africa Club Champions Cup against JS Kabylie of Algeria. After a slender 1-0 defeat in the first leg, Nkana reversed the score line in Lusaka and the game went to penalties. Mordon Malitoli’s miss denied Nkana the coveted trophy. In 1992, Simwala was appointed assistant national team coach to Samuel “Zoom” Ndhlovu.
For such a highly successful coach, it was just a matter of time before he was given the opportunity to coach the national team. Simwala was picked to replace Ndhlovu as interim Zambian coach after Zambia lost a World Cup qualifier in Madagascar in December 1992, with Godfrey Chitalu and Alex Chola as his assistants. However, he could not take up the appointment due to sickness and Chitalu became the national coach. This also affected his position at Nkana where he was made Technical Advisor and Ben Bamfuchile took over as coach.
Controversies.
Simwala’s glory days were not without controversy. In 1981, Rokana came close to their first ever league title and were level on points with Green Buffaloes going into the last game of the season. Buffaloes had won their last league match against ‘sister club’ Ndola United by a score of 6-0, leaving Rokana with the unenviable task of beating Power Dynamos by 10 goals.
They could only manage a 3-1 win and missed out on their first title on goal difference after both teams tied on 48 points. After the Buffaloes win, Simwala alleged that the match had been fixed as there was no way Ndola could lose by such a wide margin. No action was taken against Simwala though Rokana management disassociated themselves from the comments.
When Mulenga was selected ahead of Simwala by a panel of sports journalists for steering his team to the premier league from Division I he controversially aimed a barb in Simwala’s direction when it was suggested that the Nkana trainer would have been a more deserving winner, saying Simwala was assisted in his job by Butler, “I am not a man who is assisted in his job by other people. Therefore it is not a true reflection of his ability as a coach because ZCCM (Nkana’s sponsors) puts a black man in front of a white man as a trainer of Nkana Red Devils.”
Simwala reacted angrily to the slight and accused Mulenga of being ignorant, “I work independently and my job is to get good results for Nkana. I don’t work for (sponsors of the award) Rothmans or that bunch of amateurs who picked Mulenga. Mulenga should not try to downgrade me. I have been in this business for a long time. He should go fishing if he has nothing better to do. I am not interested in personal attacks. We should work together instead of criticizing each other.”
The two buried the hatchet when Mulenga apologized, stating that he had not meant to hurt Simwala’s feelings; “I am sorry for what I said and apologise most sincerely especially to Simwla and all the soccer fans. I appreciate that Simwala played more football than I did and is very good and popular. Even as a coach, he has been very successful.”
When the two teams met in the league a few weeks later, Nkana pulverized ZESCO 4-0. That same year, Simwala had a coaching stint at Swansea in Wales for 6 weeks.
In 1989, Simwala incensed the Referees Association of Zambia (RAZ) with his comments after a league game, when he remarked that his wife would have handled the game better than the referee who was in charge on the day. The RAZ gave a statement a few days later that henceforth, referees would boycott Nkana matches and Mrs. Simwala would officiate all of their games. The ban was enforced and Nkana matches had to be postponed until Simwala and the club apologized for the remarks.
In June 1992, Simwala was again in the headlines and this time he was fined and suspended for the rest of the season for attacking referee Alex Kampinda after a league match against Chambishi Blackburn at Chambishi ground which Nkana won 2-0. Although Simwala denied punching the referee and insisted that he merely touched him in the process of gesticulating, the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) still found him culpable. Due the fact that the referee left the incident out of his match report, his appeal was successfully heard though the referee was carpeted for not reporting the incident.
Death.
Simwala first experienced poor health when he was appointed interim national team trainer in January 1993 but was hospitalized at Nkana Mine Hospital as the team went into camp in Kabwe.
On Tuesday January 6, he was discharged from hospital with doctors advising him to rest for one week to recover but he decided to immediately join the national team although his wife Rhoda pleaded in vain for him to rest and join up the following day. Four days later, he was taken ill again and admitted to Kabwe General Hospital and ruled out of the squad travelling to Tanzania for a crucial World Cup encounter. Chitalu took over as coach and Zambia won the game 3-1.
Simwala spent more time in hospital in Kitwe, was discharged but readmitted after complaining of a persistent cough and general weakness. Nkana management then took the decision to appoint Ben Bamfuchile as coach until such a time when Simwala recovered fully and in the meantime, handed him the role of Technical Advisor.
In September, Nkana travelled to Ghana to defend a one goal lead against Asante Kotoko in the Africa Clubs Champions Cup quarter-final but lost 3-0. After the game, the players were informed that Simwala had died at Nkana Mine Hospital earlier in the afternoon.
He was put to rest at Chamboli Cemetery in Kitwe and was survived by a wife and five children. His son Govenda currently plays for Power Dynamos as a right-back.

The Jet Star was a very popular ride. It was built in 1993. It was originally built on the northeast corner of Surfside Pier. When the Fly - The Great Nor'easter was constructed in 1994 the Jet Star was moved to a new desk on the southern side of the pier. The Jet Star was built for a German carnival operator in 1972. Moved to Astroland on Coney Island for a year before opening at Knoebels in 1977. The Jet Star operated at Knoebels until 1992 when it was sent to Morey's Piers. In 1997 there was an accident on the ride. During the winter of 1999 the Jet Star was sold so Morey's Piers could buy the RC-48.
Incidents.
In 1997 a young boy fell out of the train when the emergency brakes stopped the ride. The child landed 29 feet below. He was in stable condition, but the boy had jaw fractures and various dental injuries. The ride did not include seat belts or any other restraints only a hand rail on the side of each train. The cause of the accident is believed to be a ride operator or a computer system designed to trigger some braking if it senses that one car is getting too close to another.

Celestyn studied Latin in Wegorzewo (Angerburg), Frydląd (Friedland in Prussia) and at the university of Königsberg. In 1609, he relocated to Wittenberg to study Protestant theology under Leonhard Hutter, Friedrich Balduin and Friedrich Meisner. In 1615, he spent some months in Leipzig and later moved to Gießen to study at the local university, where his disputation in Hebrew drew much attention. His knowledge of oriental languages was gained during his stay in Frankfurt under Christoph Helvig, Johannes Gisenius and in conversations with the Jews of Frankfurt, who introduced him to rabbinical literature. He continued his studies in Gießen and received his doctorate in 1619. During an educational journey he also visited the universities of Jena, Tübingen, Leiden, and Basel, where he broadened his knowledge of oriental languages under Johannes Buxtorf and Thomas van Erpe.

Mislow–Evans rearrangement

In organic chemistry, the Mislow–Evans rearrangement is a 2,3-sigmatropic reaction that allows the formation of allylic alcohols from allylic sulfoxides.
The reaction is a powerful way to create particular stereoisomers of the alcohol since it is highly diastereoselective and the chirality at the sulphur atom can be transmitted to the carbon next to the oxygen in the product. The sulfoxide reagent can be generated easily and enantioselectively from the corresponding sulfide by an oxidation reaction.
Mechanism.
The mechanism starts with an allylic sulfoxide which rearranges under heat to a sulfenate ester. This can be cleaved using a thiophile, which leaves the allylic alcohol as the product.

Articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting is another technique in use and is undergoing continued investigation.
Background.
Articular cartilage is a connective tissue overlying the ends of bones that provides smooth joint surfaces. Healthy cartilage is essential to the proper functioning of joints within the body.
Cartilage is composed of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix of collagen fibers and proteoglycans. It contains no blood vessels therefore its cells are dependent upon diffusion for the supply of oxygen and nutrients. Its intrinsic healing capacity is low. Injury to cartilage can lead to pain and stiffness and is the precursor to the development of osteoarthritis (degenerative joint arthritis).
History.
Articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting was initially described by Kevin R. Stone M.D., a San Francisco based orthopedic surgeon, in 1997 . The technique was devised in response to reports that many of the contemporary cartilage restoration procedures lead to the development of fibrocartilage, not true hyaline articular cartilage. Knowing that fibrocartilage was not as durable as articular cartilage and that its formation yielded only short term clinical benefits, Stone proposed his paste grafting as a means of regenerating hyaline-like cartilage. The hypothesis was that harvesting a mixture of articular cartilage and cancellous bone would combine pluripotent cells of the cancellous bone with cartilage extracellular matrix and growth factors and when exposed to continuous motion, hyaline-like cartilage would be stimulated to form.
Surgical Procedure.
Published descriptions of the articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting technique are readily available. The procedure is performed in an outpatient setting under general anesthesia. The surgical steps are summarized here:
Postoperatively, patients are requested to use a continuous passive motion machine for 6 hours a night for 4 weeks. If the defect is in a weight-bearing region, weight-bearing is restricted for 4 weeks. A guided physical therapy program begins on postoperative day 1.
Results.
In a 2 to 12 year follow-up of 125 patients, pain, functioning, and activity measures improved in 82% of patients. Eighteen of the 125 patients (14.4%) were considered failures. Histologically, 42 of 66 (63.6%) of biopsies showed strong evidence of replacement of their articular surface, and 18 of 66 biopsies (27.3%) showed development of normal looking hyaline cartilage.
Advantages.
Paste grafting is a relatively simple surgical procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. It requires minimal special instrumentation. Unexpected lesions can be treated. No tissue culture or foreign matrices are required. Paste grafting has been an effective salvage procedure for failed microfracture, failed Osteochondral Autograph Transplant Surgery (OATS) or Mosaicplasty procedures, Carticel and TruFit procedures. Compared to the cost of other complex cartilage restoration procedures, the cost of paste grafting is minimal. Disadvantages include limited experience with patella paste grafting and it remains difficult to access the very far posterior lesions.

2012–13 Irish Cup

The 2012–13 Irish Cup was the 133rd edition of the premier knock-out cup competition in Northern Irish football since its introduction in 1881. The competition began on 15 September 2012 with the first round and ended on 4 May 2013 with the final. The cup was sponsored by JJB Sports until October 2012, when the company went into administration. The competition remained without a principal sponsor, but the final was known as the Marie Curie Irish Cup final, after the IFA awarded the naming rights for the final to the charity Marie Curie Cancer Care.
Linfield were the defending champions, after defeating Crusaders 4–1 in the 2012 final to win the cup for the sixth time in seven seasons. However, in a tie that was a repeat of the previous two finals, they were knocked out in the fifth round by Crusaders, who inflicted Linfield's first defeat in the competition in four years.
The eventual winners were Glentoran, coming from a goal behind to defeat Cliftonville 3–1 after extra time to win their first Irish Cup in nine years. Glentoran qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.
Format.
119 clubs took part in this season's competition, an increase on the 116 clubs that took part the previous season. Clubs from level 4 and below on the Northern Ireland football league system entered in the first round, and played against other lower league clubs in the first three rounds. Depending on the number of participants, some clubs may be given a bye into the second round. Nine clubs were given a bye this season.
28 of the 30 IFA Championship clubs that started the season entered in the fourth round. Newry City folded after the start of the season and, of the remaining 29 clubs, PSNI did not enter on time. The IFA Championship clubs were joined in the fourth round by the lower league clubs that progressed through the first three rounds.
The winners from the fourth round matches joined the clubs from the IFA Premiership in the fifth round, and from then on it was a straight knock-out competition through to the final. Replays were only used in the fifth round, sixth round and quarter final stages, otherwise extra time and penalties were used to determine the winner if necessary.
First round.
The draw for the first round was held on 16 August 2012 with the matches played on 15 September 2012. 
Ballynahinch United, Bangor Amateurs, Crumlin United, Dunmurry Recreation, Killyleagh Youth, Magherafelt Sky Blues, Mountjoy United, Newbuildings United and Saintfield United all received byes into the second round.

Third round.
The draw for the third round took place on 1 November 2012. The 22 winners from the second round matches entered the draw for this round, with 20 of the clubs drawn to play against each other. Oxford United Stars and Rathfriland Rangers both received a bye into the fourth round because of the demise of Championship club Newry City, and the failure of fellow Championship club PSNI to enter on time. This had reduced the number of teams in the fourth round and hence it was decided to draw two byes in the third round to make up the requisite fourth-round numbers. The matches were played on 17 November 2012.

Zinc transporter 3 also known as solute carrier family 30 member 3 is a protein in humans that is encoded by the "SLC30A3" gene.
The SLC30A3 gene codes for the ZnT-3 SLC30A family membrane transport protein. ZnT-3 is required for the accumulation of zinc ions inside synaptic vesicles. In mice, ZnT-3 is required for some forms of memory that depend on the hippocampus and the amygdala. Zinc transport by ZnT-3 modulates memory formation by acting through the extracellular signal-regulated kinases signaling pathway. Angiotensin II-induced senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells requires down-regulation of ZnT-3 and ZnT-10.

<doc id="36741069" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36741069" title="SS Springfjord">
SS Springfjord

SS "Springfjord" was a 2,036 GRT cargo ship that was launched in Norway for a British shipping company in 1939, taken over by Nazi Germany in 1940, re-taken by the United Kingdom in 1945 and destroyed by the CIA in Guatemala in 1954.
In 1939 Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted (TMV) of Trondheim, Norway launched "Springfjord" for Springwell Shipping Co, Ltd of London. Springwell created a separate company, Springfjord Shipping Co, Ltd, to actually own the ship. "Springford" was a conventional cargo steamer of her era, powered by a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine of TMV's own manufacture.
Seized by Germany in the Second World War.
In April 1940, while "Springfjord" was still being fitted out in Trondheim, the German troops invaded Norway. The German authorities had her completed for "Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft "Hansa"" (DDG Hansa) of Bremen, who renamed her Rüdesheimer.
In May 1945 German forces in Norway surrendered to the incoming British military occupation. "Rüdesheimer" was seized at Tønsberg and transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport. The MoWT added its standard "Empire" prefix to her original name, making her Empire Springfjord. In 1946 the MoWT was dissolved and in 1947 the ship was restored to Springwell Shipping Co Ltd, who reinstated the original version of her name "Springfjord".
Napalmed and sunk by the CIA.
In 1954 the CIA was engineering a "coup d'état" in Guatemala to replace its elected government with a dissident Guatemalan colonel, Carlos Castillo Armas. In May 1954 the Swedish cargo ship had evaded US sea and air patrols to deliver a cargo of Czechoslovak armaments to Puerto Barrios on Guatemala's Caribbean coast to augment the elected government's defences. The CIA was determined to prevent any further arms deliveries. This included using a covert "Liberation Air Force", disguised as rebels unconnected with the USA, that the CIA had created to support Colonel Castillo's few hundred rebels.
Early on the morning of 27 June 1954, the day that the CIA "coup" forced Guatemala's elected President Jacobo Árbenz to resign and flee into exile, "Springfjord" was under charter to the US shipping company Grace Line and was at Puerto San José, Guatemala loading a mixed cargo that included coffee and 976 bales of cotton.
However, the "Liberation Air Force"'s local CIA chief believed that "Springfjord" was unloading arms, so he ordered pilot Ferdinand Schoup to attack the ship. Schoup, flying a Lockheed P-38M Lightning heavy fighter aircraft with no markings, attacked "Springfjord" with napalm bombs and set her on fire. "Springfjord" was badly damaged, but on 29 June Lloyd's of London reported that she was still afloat. On 28 June the Guatemalan government told the UK Chargé d'affaires in Guatemala City that the aircraft belonged to the insurgents.
Responsibility.
The US government had ordered the CIA "coup" partly because it opposed a Guatemalan decree to nationalize unused foreign-owned farmland. A CIA secret memorandum dated 1 July 1955 confirms that the pilot who attacked "Springfjord" was a US national and that the CIA field command ordered him to do so, but asserts that the field command did not have authorization from CIA Headquarters.
The US United Fruit Company (UFC) owned 42% of Guatemala's agricultural land, and in the UK House of Commons some British Labour Party MPs implied that the UFC was behind the "coup". A United Nations fact-finding committee had gone to Central America to investigate events in Guatemala, so on 5 July 1954 the Labour MP Philip Noel-Baker suggested that this committee should investigate whether the UFC had anything to do with obtaining the aircraft used to attack "Springfjord". Noel-Baker's Labour colleague John Strachey MP suggested that the UK government should try questioning the UFC.
During the same exchange in the Commons, other Labour MPs pursued the suspicion that the USA had orchestrated the "coup". Geoffrey Bing MP asked the Conservative government's  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Selwyn Lloyd, to ask the US government whether it sold the ammunition to the Guatemalan rebels. Lloyd retorted ""the hon. and learned Gentleman, in assuming that the United States Government are responsible in some way for this, is, I believe, stating something which is wholly divorced from the truth."" George Wigg bluntly asked ""Will the Minister be good enough to answer "Yes," or "No," to a simple question? Is it a fact that American aircraft, manned by American pilots, machine-gunned Guatemalan civilians and dropped napalm bombs on Guatemala, and that Her Majesty's Government were well aware of that fact?"" Lloyd insisted ""That is certainly not the case. Her Majesty's Government have no information of that kind whatsoever.""
On 20 October 1954 the Labour MP Leslie Plummer alleged in the House of Commons that the British Consul at Puerto San José told "Springfjord"s Master, Captain Bradford, to keep silent about the sinking of his ship and took from him a set of photographs of the incident taken by a member of "Springfjord"s crew. The Conservative Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Robin Turton, replied claiming that the British Embassy in Guatemala City had merely asked Bradford ""in view of the political situation in Guatemala, to inform them of any statement that he might be making to the Press"". Concerning the photographs, Turton claimed that the Vice-Consul had taken the film to be developed and returned it to Captain Bradford a few days later.
Compensation claims.
"Springfjord"s owners immediately lodged a claim for compensation with the Guatemalan Embassy in London. The ship insured for £170,000 (equating to about $476,000 at the then US–UK exchange rate) with Lloyd's of London's Norwegian subsidiary Norskelloyd. Her cargo was worth about $1.5 million and was underwritten jointly by 78 US insurers, who reached a settlement of $1,250,386 with her owners. On 13 October the USA, through its embassy in Guatemala, told Col. Castillo to offer $900,000. Castillo agreed and on 19 October gave the offer to the UK's Embassy in Guatemala. 
In the UK House of Commons on 8 November 1954 the Labour MP Marcus Lipton asked whether Col. Castillo's military "junta" had paid any compensation for "Springfjord"s destruction. The new Conservative Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, replied that on 16 October 1954 the "junta"s foreign minister had said his government was prepared to discuss paying ""a reasonable sum in compensation"" and would instruct the new Guatemalan ambassador to London to do so.
A month later no settlement had been reached, so on 8 December 1954 Lipton asked ""...why, in South America, this Government appears to be so flabby in protecting British interests? Is he further aware that the Government have become very unpopular with Lloyds?" Robin Turton replied that the Government was not responsible for preparing the claim, and tried to explain the delay by saying ""legal gentlemen do take a long time over these matters.""
The CIA's 1 July 1955 memorandum claims that the UK did not reply to Guatemala's offer, and that therefore on 17 January 1955 the US Embassy in Guatemala suggested to Col. Castillo that he ""prod the British for a reply"". It claims that the UK replied on 1 March ""requesting clarification as to whether the $900,000 was intended to cover only the ship and that portion of the cargo insured in Britain."" CIA Headquarters then advised Col. Castillo that the $900,000 was to cover both the ship and her cargo and was to be shared proportionately between the two groups of insurers.
In Guatemala City on 13 June 1955 the UK Embassy told the US Embassy that there had been a news leak about the negotiations between Castillo and the UK. According to the leak, US underwriters had submitted a $1.2 million claim to the Guatemalan Embassy in Washington DC and later raised it to $1.7 million, while UK underwriters had presented the Foreign Office with a claim for $1.3 million. Of that $1.3 million $280,000 was for the cargo, and it was indicated that the Foreign Office considered that part of the claim to be inflated.
The CIA's 1955 memorandum quotes someone, whose identity is erased from the published copy, as advising that ""it was doubtful whether the matter could be settled for $900,000"" and that "A more realistic figure is stated to be $1,500,000 to $2,000,000."" The relevant CIA station therefore recommended that Col. Castillo be authorized to increase his offer. CIA Headquarters replied that ""additional funds would be made available if necessary but it was added that all possibilities be exhausted before authorizing Castillo to make a settlement"".
In July 1957 Col. Castillo was assassinated by one of his own guards, and after a series of short-term successors General Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes became president of Guatemala. A memorandum dated 25 July 1958 from JC King, who was CIA Chief, Western Hemisphere Division states that the claimants' lawyer, Hafael Valls, visited Gen. Ydígoras, was initially well-received but subsequently was expelled from Guatemala. Valls accordingly proposed that the US Government take over leadership of the claim, and withhold any further aid or loans to Guatemala until the claim is settled.
King asserted that all representations for settlement had hitherto been made by British interests and that Gen. Ydígoras was very anti-British. King therefore recommended against the US pursuing the claim as Guatemala would regard this as the US acting on behalf of the UK rather than for itself. For this reason such an approach would be bound to fail and would only make the US unpopular with Gen. Ydígoras and many other Guatemalans. King also warned that Guatemala knew the aircraft that attacked "Springfjord" was not Guatemalan, and if US pressure to settle the claim provoked Guatemala that country might use its knowledge of the CIA's engineering of the 1954 "coup" to embarrass the USA. King concluded by stressing that US aid was to improve Guatemala's economy and its people's living standards ""in order to eliminate the climate for the growth of Communism"", and therefore the US could not risk giving the "Springfjord" claim precedence over aid to Guatemala.
Eighteen months after King's secret memo there was still no compensation payment, so on 10 February 1960 Marcus Lipton raised the question in the Commons again. The Conservative MP Robert Allan replied that the UK government had repeatedly asked the Guatemalan government to pay compensation for the sinking. Allan stated that ""At one time the Guatemalan Government intimated that they would be prepared to pay some compensation, but the amount they offered was totally unacceptable to the claimants.""
No compensation had been paid almost 13 years after the attack, so in 1967 Lipton submitted a written question asking the then Labour Government's Foreign Secretary ""what steps he has taken to obtain compensation from the Guatemalan Government"". On 12 June 1967 William Rodgers MP replied to the Commons that in 1963 Guatemala had suspended diplomatic relations with the UK and since then the UK government had been unable to continue to pursue the claim.

Alessandro Campeggio

Alessandro Campeggio (1504–1554) was an Italian Roman 
Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography.
Alessandro Campeggio was born in Bologna on April 12, 1504, the son of Lorenzo Campeggio and Francesca Guastavillani. His father was married and had five children, but after the death of Francesca, he entered the ecclesiastical estate and himself became a cardinal. Educated at home, Alessandro Campeggio studied Italian letters, Latin, Ancient Greek, philosophy, and Christian theology.
He was elected Bishop of Bologna on March 19, 1526. He was constituted administrated administrator of the diocese until he reached the canonical age of 27. Upon reaching the canonical age, he delayed receiving episcopal consecration, receiving an prorogation on December 11, 1529; and again in August 24, 1539; and again, April 10, 1540. On July 19, 1541, he was finally granted license to receive Holy Orders. As such, he was ordained as a priest and consecrated as a bishop on July 31, 1541 in the church of San Michele in Bosco in Bologna.
On October 15, 1541, he was nominated to be vice-legate in Avignon. As such, he arrived in Carpentras on November 10, 1542 and remained there until 1544. On August 14, 1544, he was appointed a cleric of the Apostolic Camera. When the Council of Trent was moved from Trent to Bologna, he hosted the conciliar fathers in his own palace from March 12, 1547 until November 10, 1549.
Pope Julius III made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of November 20, 1551. He received the red hat and the titular church of Santa Lucia in Selci, a deaconry raised "pro illa vice" to the status of "titulus", on December 4, 1551. He resigned the government of the Diocese of Bologna in favor of his cousin Giovanni Campeggio on March 6, 1553.
He died in Rome on September 21, 1554. He was buried in his father's tomb in Santa Maria in Trastevere.

Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla

The Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, inspired by the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant held in England the previous day, celebrated the Queen's sixty years of reign. The parade of vessels around the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar on 4 June 2012 was one of numerous events scheduled that year in honor of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The flotilla was hosted by Ocean Village Marina, a marina north of Gibraltar Harbour, on the Westside of Gibraltar.
Participation in the event exceeded expectations, with 161 vessels in the flotilla.
Inspiration.
The Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, celebrating Queen Elizabeth's sixty years of reign, was inspired by the event that was scheduled for 3 June 2012 on the River Thames in London, England. On that Sunday, more than 1,000 vessels assembled in a flotilla, the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. Despite the inclement weather, throngs of spectators congregated along the bridges and banks of the Thames to witness the seven mile flotilla that extended from Battersea to Tower Bridge. Many also watched the event that was televised on giant screens across the country. The star of the flotilla was the Royal Barge, the "Spirit of Chartwell", which was festooned with numerous flowers. Aboard the vessel were Queen Elizabeth; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Charles, Prince of Wales; his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; and Prince Harry. The festivities ended with fireworks from Tower Bridge, and the National Anthem performed by the Royal College of Music Chamber Choir and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The flotilla also represented the first public event of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. The goal of the trust is fundraising for worthy causes in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, particularly those that benefit the young.
Planning.
The proposal for a local flotilla to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee originated at the Ocean Village Marina in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. The idea was met with a positive response from boat owners at the marina just north of Gibraltar Harbour, and the Government of Gibraltar was supportive as well. The flotilla was one of numerous events scheduled in honor of the Queen. The plan was for a mid-morning briefing of skippers, followed by a military re-enactment. Also planned were addresses by the Minister for Culture and the Governor of Gibraltar, and a bagpipe recital, with the minister then joining the parade. It was anticipated that the flotilla would be led by HMS "Scimitar" of the Royal Navy. The flotilla was to leave the marina at noon on 4 June 2012, parading from the west side of the runway of Gibraltar International Airport, past Europa Point, to the east side of the runway. At that point, the vessels would turn around for the return trip. Ros Astengo, the event organiser at Ocean Village, the resort which incorporates two marinas, Ocean Village Marina and Marina Bay, indicated that, in addition to the flotilla "with all manner of vessels dressed in streamers and Union Jacks," the resort was "encouraging as much onshore support as possible with horn-tooting and flag-waving most welcome." She further noted that the resort's restaurants and bars would be featuring special meals and drinks and that there would be "a live band and DJ chill-out music in the evening." At sunset, the aerobeacon on top of the Rock of Gibraltar would be lit. Those who didn't own a vessel were requested to consider the possibility of chartering a yacht. The host of the event aspired to have the participation of one hundred vessels in the flotilla.
Expectations exceeded.
On Monday, 4 June 2012, 161 vessels assembled at the Ocean Village Marina, exceeding expectations. The participants in the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla were greeted by Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village, and Astengo. This was followed by a brief presentation by representatives of the Gibraltar Port Authority. Recommendations for safety precautions included sunscreen and maintenance of adequate distances between vessels. Given the variety of boats in the flotilla, ranging in length from to , separation of the boats by category was necessary. Small boats were at the front of the parade, followed by power boats more than in length, and, last, sailboats. The "General Elliot", a vessel of the Gibraltar Port Authority, led the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, and was supported by other official vessels. After navigating the Bay of Gibraltar and its assortment of commercial vessels, the flotilla paraded south past Europa Point, where spectators had congregated. Upon reaching Catalan Bay, south of the airport runway and Eastern Beach, the participants in the flotilla greeted spectators on the beach and turned around for the return trip to the marina. A number of participants were passengers on chartered boats. The festivities continued that day at Ocean Village, and included a crew party at the resort's champagne bar. At sunset, the Jubilee Beacon was lit by Kaiane Aldorino, former Miss World.

Destinazione paradiso (song)

"Destinazione paradiso" is a song written and recorded by Italian singer-songwriter Gianluca Grignani together with Massimo Luca, who produced the track for Grignani's debut album with the same title. 
The song was first performed by Grignani during the Sanremo Music Festival in 1995, when he competed in the newcomers' section, finishing in sixth place. It later became Grignani's first big success, launching his career in Italy. The song was also recorded by Grignani in a Spanish-language version, titled "Destino paraíso" and included in the Hispanic edition of his album, released with the same title in 1995. This version of the song peaked at number 16 on the "Billboard" Latin Pop Airplay chart.
In 2006, Italian singer Laura Pausini recorded a cover of both versions of the song, including "Destinazione paradiso" on "Io canto" and "Destino paraíso" on the Spanish-language version of the album, "Yo canto". After being performed during her 2007's concert at the San Siro stadium in Milan, the live performance of the song was released as a single promoting the video album "San Siro 2007".
Background and composition.
The song was composed by Grignani with Italian songwriter and record producer Massimo Luca. During an interview released in 1995, Grignani revealed that he wrote the lyrics of the song in a moment of deep suffering, while he was one step from suicide: "It was more than one year ago 1994, my lack of self-confidence exploded in single moment. That days, my parents were divorcing". Grignani also explained that he didn't intend to extend the message of his song to his whole generation: "I just wanted to express my personal way of being or not being".
The song was performed for the first time on 23 February 1995, during the third night of the 45th Sanremo Music Festival, as Grignani's entry for the newcomers' competition. Grignani was scheduled to perform as the second artist on the night but, for the first time in the contest's history, the order was changed at the last moment, therefore Grignani opened the competition, replacing Danilo Amerio who was late because of a traffic jam.
During the night, it received 6,541 placing first on his semi-final and being admitted to the newcomers' final, held on the following day. After performing the song for a second time, Grignani received 9,434 votes, pacing sixth in the newcomers' section.
Laura Pausini version.
Italian singer Laura Pausini recorded the song in 2006 for her album "Io canto", entirely composed of covers of songs by Italian male singer-songwriters. The Spanish-language version of the song, "Destino paraíso", was also recorded and included in the Hispanic version of the album, "Yo canto", released in Spain, South America and in the United States.
Pausini performed the song live during her 2007 only concert, held at the San Siro stadium in Milan. This performance was included in the live and video album "San Siro 2007", released on 30 November 2007, and it was chosen as a single from the album, together with "Y mi banda toca el rock".
Commercial performance.
Immediately after its release, the song entered the Italian Top Digital Download, compiled by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry, debuting and peaking at number eight. However, until January 2008, FIMI considered the physical singles chart as the official one in Italy, and "Destinazione paradiso" was released as a digital download only. In January 2008, when the Top Digital Download became the primary singles chart in Italy, the song spent three additional weeks on the chart's top 20, reaching number 14 in the week of 10 January 2008.

Kimbel and Cabus

Kimbel and Cabus was a Victorian-era furniture and decorative arts firm based in New York City. The partnership was formed in 1862 between German-born cabinetmaker Anthony Kimbel (c. 1821–1895) and French-born cabinetmaker Joseph Cabus (1824–1894). The company was noted for its Modern Gothic and Anglo-Japanese style furniture, which it popularized at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.
Prior partners.
In an earlier partnership with Anton Bembe, Kimbel contributed to the decoration of the new House of Representatives Chamber at the U.S. Capitol. The firm carved 131 Rococo Revival armchairs (designed by architect Thomas U. Walter) for members of Congress, half of the total; and manufactured the monumental clock (designed by Joseph A. Bailly and William Henry Rinehart) over the chamber's entrance. The firm of Bembe & Kimbel lasted from 1854 to Bembe's death in 1861.
Cabus had a brief partnership with cabinetmaker Alexander Roux.
K & C.
Kimbel & Cabus won great acclaim at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a display of Modern Gothic furniture. This Aesthetic Movement style was a rebellion against the ornate excesses of Victorian decoration. Modern Gothic furniture had silhouettes that were angular and sometimes asymmetrical, and surfaces that were often ebonized and decorated with incised gilt decoration, inlaid tiles and painting, and strap-like medieval hinges. The eclectic style was short-lived, but had a major influence on the later Arts & Crafts Movement. K & C also created furniture in the Anglo-Japanese style, taking its inspiration from Japanese art and handicrafts.
Two more-traditional Kimbel & Cabus commissions were for the interior woodwork of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (1875) and the Tenth Company Room at the Seventh Regiment Armory (1879–80).
By 1878, the American critic Clarence Cook was already pronouncing the Modern Gothic style "passé":
""There was a little while ago quite a rage for a certain style of furniture that made a great display of seeming steel hinges, key-plates, and handles, with inlaid tiles, carving of an ultra-Gothic type, and an appearance of the ingenuous truth-telling in the construction. The chairs, tables and bedsteads looked as if they had been on the dissecting-table and flayed alive,—their joints and tendons displayed to an archaeologic and unfeeling world. One particular firm" & Cabus "introduced this style of furniture, and, for a time, had almost the monopoly of it. It had a great run.""
The Kimbel & Cabus partnership was dissolved in 1882, with Kimbel going into business with his sons, and Cabus forming his own shop. 
Much of Kimbel & Cabus's furniture is unsigned. But a circa-1875 trade catalogue at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum contains photographs of hundreds of pieces. Examples of their work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hudson River Museum, the High Museum of Art, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Great Britain.
McKim, Mead & White.
Cabus collaborated with Stanford White and Louis Comfort Tiffany on the interiors of the Villard Houses (1882–84), and carved the Charles Follen McKim-designed pulpit for the Church of the Ascension (1884). He carved White-designed picture frames "from roughly 1882 to 1894," and constructed White's original wood-and-plaster Washington Square Arch (1889, replaced by current arch 1892). Under McKim, Mead & White, Cabus also executed the finer woodworking for James Gordon Bennett, Jr.'s office in the Western Union Building (1885, demolished), the interior of Bennett's yacht, "Namouna" (1885, destroyed), the Anne W. Cheney House in South Manchester, Connecticut (1887, demolished), Following Cabus's 1894 death, his son Alexander took over the carving of White's picture frames.

Rooikoppies, also known as Marikana, is a town in Rustenburg local municipality, Bojanala Platinum District Municipality district in the North West province of South Africa.
The name Rooikoppies means 'red hills' in Afrikaans.
Neighbouring localities include Marikana train station (1 km to the north-east), Wonderkop (4 km), Ramala, Rietfontein, Rustenburg (29 km); Swaershoek (30 km); Mooinooi (31 km); Brits (36 km); Monnakoto (38 km); Hartbeespoort (43 km); Kosmos (48 km).
History.
The town was laid out in 1870 on the farm Rooikoppes, and the settlement later expanded into seven white-owned farms. In 1933, the Buffelspoort Dam was built, allowing the local farmers to irrigate their crops.
The farming community grew in the 1960s on the back of lucrative Tabacco farming, but other diversified farming practices i.e. cattle, maize, chillies, paprika, soya, lusern and sunflower amongst the main groups was the main economic driver of the area. In the 1970s mining was introduced and grew to become the main industry in the region. The main mining activities are PGMs and chrome. Since the introduction of mining activities the informal and form population had a growth explosion.
The Marikana miners' strike of 10 August 2012 and the subsequent killing of 34 workers by police made headlines in the international media.

Cassidulina

Cassidulina is a foraminiferal genus described in the Treatise Part C. (Leoblich and Tappan, 1964), as having a free, lenticular test, with central boss of clear calcite on either side. Chambers are biserially arranged, enrolled planispirally with a subangular to keeled periphery. The wall is calcareous, hyaline (glassy), optically granular, perforate. The surface is smooth with a polished appearance. Sutures are radial to oblique, straight or curved. The aperture is a narrow arched slip at the base of the apertural face, partly closed by an apertural place. (Loeblich and Tappan 1988) 
The taxonomy of "Cassidulina" is rather stable, and is included in the Cassidulinidae at least as far back as Cushman, 1950. Related genera include "Cassidulinella", "Favocassidulina", "Globocassidulina", and "Buriela". "Cassidulina", itself, is cosmopolitan, with a stratigraphic range extending from the Upper Eocene to recent.

Salacgrīva fortress

Salacgrīva fortress was a medieval castle located on the right bank of the Salaca river, in the historical region of Vidzeme, northern Latvia. Built in 1226 by the bishopric of Riga, it served as an outpost to control access to the port of Salaca. It was heavily damaged by Russian, Tartars, Polish and the Swedish troops dutring the Northern Wars.
The word 'Salacgrīva' means 'Mouth (estuary) of Salaca'.
History.
In 1226, Albert of Riga had the three-tower castle "Salis" or "Salismünde" built about half a kilometer from the river mouth, which served as a powerful fortress to monitor access to the port of Salaca. Captured in 1391 and burned in 1564, it was drastically damaged in 1575 by Russian and Tartar warriors who fought side by side with the troops of Duke Magnus of Holstein.
In 1581, it was attacked by the Swedish troops of Commander Thomas von Enden, and during the Second Northern War it was almost destroyed. Between 1702 and 1704, it was finally demolished, and since then there have been no restoration works carried out there.

Genoa (Amtrak station)

The Genoa Amtrak station was a proposed train station to be located in Genoa, Illinois, and would have served a new Chicago-Rockford-Dubuque Amtrak route that was expected to begin operation in late 2014 or early 2015. Genoa would have served the growing population of DeKalb County, as well as Northern Illinois University, which is located about 16 miles south of the station. There were never official plans for the station released, although students from Genoa-Kingston High School did unofficial designs for the station. Those designs may have potentially been used for the station.
Cancellation of Proposal.
On April 10, 2014, a new plan for Amtrak service that would omit Genoa was released due to the inability for IDOT to negotiate a deal with the Canadian National Railway, who owns the tracks the old proposal was going to use. The new proposal is going to use a route through downtown Elgin, Huntley, and Belvidere before terminating in Rockford.
