London Buses route E6

London Buses route E6 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between Greenford station and Bulls Bridge, it is operated by Metroline.
History.
Route E6 commenced operating on 21 July 1990 as part of the "E-Line" network operated by London Regional Transport subsidiary CentreWest from Hanwell garage.
Mainly replacing withdrawn route 274, it originally ran Mondays to Saturdays from Hayes and Harlington station to Greenford Red Lion via the Willow Tree Estate and Ferrymead Gardens, with an extension to Greenford station during Monday to Friday peak hours. As with the other E-Line routes, it used Wright Nimbus bodied Renault S75 minibuses.
On 27 March 1993, Hanwell garage closed, and its routes and the buses were transferred to the new Greenford garage. On the same date, route E6's extension to Greenford station was withdrawn.
CentreWest was privatised in a management buyout in September 1994, before being acquired by FirstGroup in March 1997. Upon being re-tendered in May 1997 the route was retained by CentrWest and the Renault minibuses with Marshall Capital bodied Dennis Dart SLFs. At the same time, the route was extended from Hayes to Bull's Bridge Tesco via Cranford Drive, and evening and Sunday services were added.
Upon being re-tendered in May 2002, route E6 passed to Hayes-based independent operator Wings Buses, who ordered 8.8m Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLFs for the route. It was extended again to Greenford station and re-routed via Ruislip Road, route E10 taking over the Ferrymead Gardens section. The extension also made room at Greenford Red Lion for new route E11.
Route E6 was included in the March 2004 sale of Wings Buses to Tellings-Golden Miller, who in turn sold their London operations to Travel London in June 2005.
Upon being re-tendered, on 26 May 2007 route E6 passed to Metroline's Perivale West garage. Metroline originally used 8.9m Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Darts, before these were replaced with 10.2m Enviro200s in 2008 for capacity reasons. In 2012 MCV Evolution bodied MAN 12.240s were introduced.

Lobelia erinus

Lobelia erinus (Edging Lobelia, Garden Lobelia or Trailing Lobelia) is a species of "Lobelia" native to southern Africa, from Malawi and Namibia south to South Africa.
Description.
It is a prostrate or scrambling herbaceous perennial plant growing to 8–15 cm tall. The basal leaves are oval, 10 mm long and 4-8 mm broad, with a toothed margin; leaves higher on the stems are slender and sometimes untoothed. The flowers are blue to violet in wild plants, with a five-lobed corolla 8–20 mm across; they are produced in loose panicles. The fruit is a 5–8 mm capsule containing numerous small seeds.
Cultivation and uses.
"Lobelia erinus" is a very popular edging plant in gardens, especially for hanging baskets and window boxes. It has a particularly long flowering period, from mid spring to early autumn. It is perennial in subtropical climates, but often grown as an annual plant in colder areas. It is widely available in Spring as a young plant, but must be kept indoors until all danger of frost has passed. Numerous cultivars have been selected, either with a bushy or a trailing habit, in a wide range of flower colours, including white, pink, red, pale to dark blue, and purple, often with a prominent white eye. Some of the better known cultivars include 'Blue Moon', 'Gracilis', 'Crystal Palace', 'Sapphire', 'Rosamund' and 'Riviela Rose'.

Otto Volger

Georg Heinrich Otto Volger (January 30, 1822 - October 18, 1897) was a German geologist born in Lüneburg. 
He studied natural history at the University of Göttingen, and later taught classes in natural history at the Muri monastery in Aargau.
From 1851 to 1856 he was a professor of natural history at the University of Zurich, and afterwards taught geology at the "Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg". From 1859 to 1881 he taught geology and mineralogy at the "Freie Deutsche Hochstift" in Frankfurt-am-Main.
Volger made contributions in the fields of mineralogy and crystallography, and was particularly interested in earthquakes. He did extensive study of earthquakes in Switzerland; researching their origins, periodicity, meteorological and environmental factors, as well as the spread and expansion of the quakes. Volger advocated the theory of neptunism. Independent of geologist Robert Mallet (1810-1881), he created his own neptunistic theory of wave propagation of earthquakes. Volger believed that most earthquakes in Switzerland were subsidence quakes caused by collapse of layers of hollow strata in the Earth.
In 1863, Volger purchased the birthplace of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), and meticulously restored the house to the condition left by Goethe's father.

Grex (biology)

A grex (or 'slug') is a multicellular aggregate of amoeba of the groups Acrasiomycota or Dictyosteliida that can be formed when the amoeba run out of food. It takes its form when the column formed from the aggregation of cells collapses due to its height, and becomes a slug-shaped mass. The grex moves as a unit, and the individual organisms form a "fruiting body", in which amoeba are differentiated into stalk cells and spore cells. The latter can be transported by wind or water a distance that is relatively great compared with what the organisms can achieve in their typical form; the former desiccate and die. Its name comes from the Latin word meaning 'flock'.

Dhauli

Dhauli hills () are located on the banks of the river Daya, 8 km south of Bhubaneswar in Odisha (India). It is a hill with vast open space adjoining it, and has major Edicts of Ashoka engraved on a mass of rock, by the side of the road leading to the summit of the hill. Dhauli hill is presumed to be the area where the Kalinga War was fought.
The Rock Edicts found here include Nos. I-X, XIV and two separate Kalinga Edicts. In Kalinga Edict VI, he expresses his concern for the ""welfare of the whole world"". The rock-cut elephant above the Edicts is the earliest Buddhist sculpture of Odisha. The stone elephant shows the animal's foreparts only, though it has a fine sense of form and movement. 
Ashoka had a special weakness for Dhauli, where the battle was fought. The Daya river is said to have turned red with the blood of the many deceased after the battle, and enabled Ashoka to realize the magnitude of horror associated with war. He saw to it that Dhauli became an important centre of Buddhist activities. He built several chaityas, stupas and pillars there. He got abodes excavated for the recluse, instructions inscribed for officials, expounded the main principles of dandaniti for the public, provided special status to his new kingdom including the stupas at Dhauli.
On the top of the hill, a dazzling white peace pagoda has been built by the "Japan Buddha Sangha" and the "Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha" in the 1970s.
The nearby region also houses Ashokan edicts and possibly a Stupa at Bhaskareshwar temple at Tankapani road as argued by scholars.
The Dhauligiri hills also has an ancient Shiva temple which is the place for mass gathering during Shiva Ratri Celebrations.

Jinrikisha (, or ricksha) services can be found near the entrances to popular sites as Tōdai-ji or Kōfuku-ji.
While Nara Park is usually associated with the broad areas of the temples and the park proper, previously private gardens are now open to public. These gardens make use of the temple buildings as adjunct features of their landscapes.
The park is home to the Nara National Museum and Todai-ji, where the largest wooden building in the world houses a 50' tall statue of Buddha.
Deer.
According to local folklore, deer from this area were considered sacred due to a visit from Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto, one of the four gods of Kasuga Shrine. He was said to have been invited from Kashima, Ibaraki, and appeared on Mt. Mikasa-yama riding a white deer. From that point, the deer were considered divine and sacred by both Kasuga Shrine and Kōfuku-ji. Killing one of these sacred deer was a capital offense punishable by death up until 1637, the last recorded date of a breach of that law.
After World War II, the deer were officially stripped of their sacred/divine status, and were instead designated as national treasures and are protected as such. Today, visitors can purchase "deer-crackers" ( "Shika-senbei") to feed the deer in the park. These crackers are exclusively sold by the WNOW company.

Jeremy Mayall

Jeremy Mayall (a.k.a. Remy) (born November 29, 1983) is a New Zealand composer, record producer, musician, multi-instrumentalist, DJ and film maker best known for his ONE FAT MAN album "A Typical Day in Suburbia", and his "Symphony No 1 for Orchestra and Turntables", which was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra (APO). The premiere performance was given by the Wellington Youth Orchestra (WYO) in 2005.
Biography.
Born and raised in Hamilton, NZ he was schooled in music from age 5. Starting with piano lessons, he progressed on to drums, harmonica, and bass. He now plays turntables, synths, melodica, and theremin among others. He also likes to perform using unconventional instruments such as iPhones, and watering cans. He also regularly sings with several bands, and in theatrical stage shows. He has performed throughout NZ, as well as in Fiji, Nouméa, Vanuatu, Singapore and the USA.
Academic study has been based at the University of Waikato and has a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) - majoring in Music, and a Masters degree (receiving First Class Honours), majoring in composition. He is currently completing doctoral study in musical composition at the University of Waikato. For all his graduate study Jeremy has been awarded a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship, and was Creative/Performing Arts Person of the Year for 2005, Media Personality of the Year 2005 and the inaugural winner of the Sir Edmund Hillary Medal. He was also the recipient of the Hamilton City Council BeatStreet award for Excellence in Creative and Performing Arts, and the Hamilton City Council Supreme Youth Award in 2008.
He married Courteney Mayall (née Bell) on the 1st May 2010. She is a hairstylist and special FX make-up artist.
Music.
His music exists in almost all genres, including solo and chamber music, orchestral music, music for theatre and film, pop, hip-hop, jazz, as well as electro-acoustic music. His works always tend to favour the bizarre or fantastical elements of the imagination and his pieces always tend to look for a new form of expression, whether through turntables in an orchestra, to live electro-acoustic music for electric bass and turntables, to kitchen utensils as musical instruments. A fascination with Hip Hop music and culture, as well as the historical interest in many other musical forms (Jazz, Soul, Funk) and his interest in Film, has been a strong influence on his music.
At the age of 20 he wrote his first symphony – Symphony No 1 for Orchestra and Turntables (which has been performed by the APO, NZSO, WYO, DYO and NZSSSO). This is the first symphony to be written including modern turntablist techniques. He also released his first album through his production and pop music identity of ONE FAT MAN. The album 'a typical day in suburbia' received excellent reviews. It features styles that span the musical continuum from jazz to pop, to soul and hip hop. The album featured a range of local performers from Remy's home town of Hamilton, NZ. It contains tracks by local singers (Stephie Christian, Linda Dee, Landy Tyrell, Silua Fifita); rappers (Hitz, Ptt); and instrumentalists (Mike Mello, Rat Daddy, James Sutherland, Black C).
More recently Mayall has been performing and recording live electro-acoustic soundscapes for turntables, watering cans, electronics and taonga puoro with Richard Nunns and with performance ensemble Sonic Warp with Daniel Peters. He has also been recording electro/synth-pop with his side project …howard. This band has already created a 7 track EP - "Remaking Pearl Harbour", and an 11 track concept album "They no longer sleep alone". This concept album has since been developed into a feature length film by Chasing Time Productions.
Film and Theatre Music.
Mayall regularly writes film music. In 2007 he composed, recorded and produced all the sound elements and music for the film-noir horror 'Down by the Riverside'. (Downending Films site).
'Down by the Riverside' was nominated for BEST FOREIGN FILM at the B-Movie Festival in New York.
He has also composed the score and sound design for “Pictures of You” and "They No Longer Sleep Alone" both by Chasing Time Productions.
Other recent film projects include the narrative dance films Lucid and Beat.
He has also recently formed at film music composing team called The Scorelocks Collective with fellow Hamilton composer Chris Lam Sam.
Three films they have scored have been accepted into international festivals. (Finding Marilyn in Castel del'Aquila, Lily White and Hunter)
In theatre music, Mayall has most often written musicals. Including the songs for "Alice and the Velvetty Tea cup", "Santa Claus" and most recently "Life in the Key of..." which was produced for the Hamilton Ignition Fringe Festival 2010, and received strong reviews.

Talkative Man

Talkative Man is a novel by R. K. Narayan first published in 1986 by Heinemann. The book is Narayan's 13th novel. Like his earlier novels, this one is also set in the fictional town of Malgudi. The novel is a bit short by Narayan's standards but provides the same level of enjoyment one experiences with his other writings.
Plot.
The main character is an ordinary man who is wealthy and works as a journalist. He has a regular routine in his life: post articles in the post box, have a talk with people in a tea shop, go to library and house. One day, he meets a man from an unknown land called "Timbuctoo", another of Narayan's creations, the land being similar to the US. The man seems to have come for an official duty for UN and, seeing the calmness of the place, decides to stay here for his work. There comes a twist of what is exactly the man up to and how the main character of the novel solves the problem. The story is simple, and the author honestly admits to being a short story writer, rather than a novelist as he tells; most of the people skip the intrinsic details given about the places and only catch the content (at the end of the book, his words about the story). It is a good read book and can be read for the calmness with which Narayan writes his story, as a critic rightly points out .

Arctoceras

Arctoceras is a ceratitid ammonoid genus from the Lower Triassic with a moderately narrow discoidal shell and ceratitic suture.
The shell of "Arctoceras" is generally involute with compressed whorls that are much higher than wide, flattened sides, narrowly rounded ventral rim, and sutures with wide low saddles and simple serrated lobes.
"Arctoceras" was named by Hyatt, (1900). The genotype "Arctoceras polaris" (Mojsisovics) comes from Spitsbergen. "Arctoceras" is the type genus of the Arctoceratidae which is a family in the Meekocerataceae, a superfamily within the Ceratitida. Ceratitids are ammonoid cephalopods, mostly from the Triassic but with ancestral forms in the Upper Permian. Meekocerataceae sometimes appears as Meekoceratoidea to conform with a recent ruling of the ICZN regarding superfamily endings. 
"Arctoceras" has been reported from Canada, the United States, Russia, Australia, Afghanistan, and Malaysia.

List of heritage registers

This list is of heritage registers, inventories of cultural properties, natural and man-made, tangible and intangible, movable and immovable, that are deemed to be of sufficient heritage value to be separately identified and recorded. In many instances the pages linked below have as their primary focus the registered assets rather than the registers themselves. Where a particular article or set of articles on a foreign-language Wikipedia provides fuller coverage, a link is provided.
China.
Hangzhou.
Sites Protected at the City Level of Hangzhou are districts, artifacts or buildings legally declared to be "protected". According to the "Regularations of historic districts and historic buildings in Hangzhou" effectivated from 1 January 2005, historic buildings are those artifacts or districts that have lasted more than 50 years, and of significant values for history, science, and art study. In Hangzhou, declaring a historic house requires consulting the urban planning administration bureau, and the real estate administration bureau.
As of 31 June 2011, there are 287 declared historic houses in Hangzhou, proclaimed as 5 batches. In the near future, it is going to issue the sixth batch which includes 51 historic houses.
Luxembourg.
The list is maintained by Service des sites et monuments nationaux, a Government agency. The latest version is available here [http://www.ssmn.public.lu/legislation/maj-liste.pdf].

Serbia.
Cultural Heritage of Serbia (see also: World Heritage Sites in Serbia)
The register is divided into twelve categories:
United Kingdom.
Heritage, culture, planning and conservation are devolved issues in the United Kingdom, and are dealt with by the governments of the constituent countries. England, which does not have its own devolved government, is covered by an agency of the United Kingdom government. See also Historic Environment Record (HERs) and Sites and Monuments Record (SMRs) maintained usually at a local government level (Archaeological Trusts in Wales).
United States.
In the United States, listings on the National Register of Historic Places are made only on recommendation from State Historic Preservation Offices in each of the US states. Individual states maintain their own historic registers, although in some US states all properties on the state register duplicate the National Register listing. The National Register listing in itself confers no protection to a historic property but may qualify the site for matching grants for historic restoration.
Local historic designations in many US municipalities provide some limited protection against demolition of historic landmarks.

Dust pneumonia

Dust pneumonia describes disorders caused by excessive exposure to dust storms, particularly during the Dust Bowl in the United States. A form of pneumonia, dust pneumonia results when the lungs are filled with dust, inflaming the alveoli. The dust pneumonia was featured in the work of several musicians and artists of the day, such as Woody Guthrie's song "Dust Pneumonia Blues".
Symptoms of dust pneumonia include high fever, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing. People who had dust pneumonia often died. There are no official death rates published for the Great Plains in the 1930s, but Red Cross volunteers made and distributed thousands of dust masks. The Kansas State Board of Health reported that in April 1935, 17 people had already died from dust pneumonia. With dust pneumonia, dust settles all the way into the alveoli of the lungs, stopping the cilia from moving and preventing the lungs from ever clearing themselves.

Hospital Music

Hospital Music is the third solo album by Canadian musician Matthew Good. It was released on July 31, 2007 Good performed nearly all the instruments himself, with the exception of drums and a few guitar and bass parts. The album artwork was painted by Vancouver resident Jeremy Crowle.
"Born Losers" was featured as the "Single of the Week" on the American iTunes Store for the week starting July 31, 2007. The debut was significant due to Good's lack of previous success in the U.S. market, where he had previously released only one album - 2001's Beautiful Midnight, which failed to make a major impact on the U.S. charts (due to Good's lack of co-operation). 
"Hospital Music" debuted at #1 on the Canadian albums chart, selling over 11,000 copies in its first week of release. The album was certified Gold in Canada on January 16, 2008.
It was nominated at the 2008 Juno Awards for Best Rock Album.

Balvia

Balvia is an ammonoid cephalopod genus from the Upper Devonian belonging to the goniatitid family Prionoceratidae. 
"Balvia" has a small, lenticular to subglobular shell with a punctate umbilicus, that is completely involute. Growth lines are fine, forward slanting, concavo-convex; indicate well developed ventrolateral salients and hyponomic sinus. Flanks have several weak constrictions, which usually swing forward at venter to form grooves bounding a median keel. The aperture may be modified. 
"Balvia" was named by Dieter Korn in 1994 with the redescription of the type species, "Gattendorfia globularis" originally described by Schmidt in 1924. The genus was further divided into the subgenera "B.(Balvia)", "B. (Mayneoceras)", and "B.(Kenseyoceras)" by Becker in 1996.

Balticeras

Balticeras is an involute, discoidal Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) ammonite (order Ammonitida) found in England, Germany, and Switzerland, belonging to the Perisphinctidae. The shell is strongly embracing, tending to be oxyconic (sharp rimmed). Sides are gently curved, converging on a narrow to sharp ventral rim. 
"Balticeras" is considered by some to be a subgenus of "Ringsteadia" which in contrast is more evolute, with ribbed inner whorls. Both are included in the Pictoniinae, a subfamily established by Spath, 1924, for large ammonites within the Perisphinctidae, tending to develop smooth middle and outer whorls.

Soultaker (film)

Soultaker is a 1990 fantasy horror film starring Vivian Schilling, Joe Estevez, Chuck Williams and Robert Z'Dar. The film was featured on an episode of movie-mocking TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Plot.
The film begins in a hospital where the Soultaker is trying to find a room containing an elderly man. He eventually finds the room. The Soultaker looks at his pocket watch before using a ring to take the man's soul. The next day, a rich teen-aged girl named Natalie McMillan and her friend Karen get ready to go to "Summerfest". Meanwhile, a teenaged boy named Brad (David "Shark" Fralick) goes to pick up Natalie's former boyfriend Zack to go to Summerfest. Zack tells Brad that he wants to see Natalie again, but Brad tells him that he can never win a girl like Natalie again without money. Later they go to pick up another teenager named Tommy Marcetto.
At Summerfest, the Angel of Death tells Soultaker to kill Brad, Tommy (Chuck Williams), Zack, Natalie, and Brad's girlfriend Candice at 8:00. During Summerfest, Karen leaves Summerfest with her boyfriend John leaving Natalie behind. Before Brad, Tommy, Zack, and Candice leave the festival, Zack notices Natalie alone. Zack comes up to Natalie and the two reconcile. Zack offers to take Natalie home. Natalie takes his offer. The five teenagers take Brad's car and leave Summerfest. Brad - who is high on cocaine - is speeding. The Soultaker steps in the middle of the road. To avoid running over the Soultaker, Brad swerves and crashes into a tree. After the crash, Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy find themselves a little away from the car unharmed. The four realize that Candice is missing.
Meanwhile, the Soultaker is at the crash site where it is shown that everyone has been critically injured. Soultaker takes Candice's soul. When Soultaker tries to get Brad's soul, he discovers that Candice's soul was still in her body but every one else's souls flew out. The Soultaker delivers the soul to the Angel of Death and explains that the others were displaced from their bodies, however it is never explained how this happened. The Angel of Death tells Soultaker to hunt down the other souls before midnight, and he must abide by the rules of time and space (although this is never clarified either). Later, the police and the ambulance are at the site. The ambulance takes the bodies and the police search the car. The police finds the cocaine that Brad had hidden in the car. Everybody comes back to the crash site after the police and the ambulance have gone. Brad searches the car to find his cocaine. All of the souls realize that Candice had died in the crash.
The Soultaker reveals himself, materializing from within the car, and claims Brad's soul while the others are helpless to stop him, and flee. The others find a convenience store where they try to tell the cashier that someone is trying to kill them, but the cashier does not notice their presence. Assuming the man is ignoring them, they leave the store, and the Soultaker appears again and grabs Natalie, to claim her soul, but her resemblance to his past love stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy runs back to the store, and pleads for help from the cashier, to no avail. Tommy attempts to gain his attention by breaking a soda bottle, but this only confuses the cashier. The Soultaker is about to claim Tommy, when the Angel of Death appears to collect Brad's soul, and to reprimand his subordinate for failing to take Natalie when he had the chance. After delivering Brad's soul, the Soultaker enters the store and claims Tommy's soul.
Natalie and Zack are still fleeing with The Man behind them. The duo make it to Natalie's house. Before they open the door, Natalie's mother, Anna (Jean Reiner) opens the door. Zack and Natalie tells them about the Soultaker. Anna tells them that they will be safe inside. Anna tells Natalie that she will run a bath for Natalie, so she can relax. After Anna goes upstairs, Natalie apologizes to Zack for the loss of his friend. Zack also apologizes about the cocaine in the car.
Natalie goes upstairs. When she gets upstairs Natalie and Anna talks about Natalie's relationship with Zack. Natalie tells Anna that she will go to her room and lie down. When Natalie goes lie down, she falls asleep and dreams about being taken to the hospital. Anna wakes her to tell Natalie that the tub is full. Meanwhile, downstairs Zack hears something growling in the kitchen. When he goes to investigate, it was only the family dog, Charlie. Zack tells Charlie that no one will hurt him. It is shown that the reason Charlie is growling is because he can't see Zack, but can sense his presence.
Back upstairs, Natalie gets ready to bathe, and it is revealed that her mother is watching her undress.
While watching T.V., the news comes on and reports about the car crash. One of the reporters interviewing Natalie's father Grant reports that with parents permission the life support systems for Natalie and Zack will be shut of at midnight. Zack sees Anna on the news. Natalie discovers her mother watching her, and is disgusted, then horrified when her mother suddenly morphs into the Man that has been pursuing them. Instead of attacking her, The Soultaker attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life, with the one proviso being that she stay by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is easily overpowered. Natalie gets her father's shotgun and shoots the Man, to no effect, as the Soultaker reveals his nature by claiming that she "can't kill a man that is already dead."
The two manage to escape and flee to the hospital to return to their bodies before midnight before their life support systems will be shut off. In the hospital, Natalie is captured by the Man on an elevator which leads to the afterlife. The Man claims he is an angel and his duty it to collect the souls of the dying. He manages to convince Natalie that there is nothing left for her in living realm, and that Zack is already dead, but she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a grim reaper. Brad reveals that those who take a life, even if accidentally, they must pay for it through service as a grim reaper. Brad gives Zach two empty soul rings to help Zach and Natalie into their bodies, and helps him rescue Natalie from the Soultaker.
Natalie places herself in the ring over her body, but she still remains comatose. Zach discovers that a pendant she was wearing somehow acted as a barrier between her soul and her body, and he pulls her soul from her body and is about to attempt to return her to her body again, when the Soultaker appears again. The Soultaker chases Zack all the way to the top of the hospital, and corners him on the roof. Zach remembers that he is a soul and is no longer bound by death or pain, and escapes by leaping off the roof. The Soultaker is about to give chase, but is confronted by the Angel of Death once again. The Angel of Death informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed, for if the two died now, their souls would be lost forever. The Soultaker pleas with the Angel, promising that he can correct these errors, but is beyond forgiveness, and is collected into a soul ring by his master.
The movie ends with Zack visiting Natalie in the hospital on the day of her release. Zack is greeted happily by Natalie's parents who used to not care for Zack at all. The two go outside to see that Zack finally fixed up his old car and the two kiss and drive off together.
Releases.
Image Entertainment released the film onto DVD in 2000. However, this DVD is currently out of print. In 2009, Shout! Factory released the MST3K episode featuring the film as part of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000 - XIV" DVD box set. This release includes an interview with Joe Estevez as a bonus feature.

Stage 5

Stage 5 (or, originally, "Stage V") is an unofficial stage at the Walnut Valley Festival, an annual bluegrass festival in Winfield, Kansas, United States. 
Set up in the Pecan Grove campground, the informal stage began in 1987 when camper Russell Brace and friends built it on the back of a flatbed truck. The stage is so-named because the festival proper has four main stages.
The stage was immediately popular and is now a cherished tradition at the annual event. 
Audiences at Stage 5 can usually expect to hear typical acoustic string instruments. However, many musicians, while there, part from traditional bluegrass styles and emphasize a looser, more rock-oriented interpretation of roots music.
Several notables have played Stage 5. Among them: Tommy Emmanuel, The Wilders, Beppe Gambetta, an early incarnation of the Dixie Chicks, and Split Lip Rayfield.

Charles W. Nichols

Charles Walter Nichols and his father, William H. Nichols, helped organize the merger of 12 companies in 1899 to create General Chemical, which in 1921 joined four other companies to form Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation, a precursor to AlliedSignal, now owned by Honeywell as its specialty materials business. Charles Nichols, who served as a vice president and general manager at General Chemical and later Allied, also acquired the land and built what is now known at Pleasantdale Chateau in West Orange, New Jersey.
Pleasantdale Chateau.
Nichols acquired a number of contiguous farms in 1912 and created a estate with formal gardens in West Orange. The Nichols family used the property as a summer weekend retreat and occupied a small farmhouse. But after a number of years, the family desired a larger home. In the 1920s, Nichols set out to build his country estate, preferring the Norman style of architecture from the south of England and the north of France. He hired Augustus N. Allen as his architect and the two toured Europe to seek out Norman style buildings and designed Pleasantdale Chateau. The exterior of the house, which was completed in 1933, is of the Norman half-timber and stucco character, while the interior reflects a number of period styles. 
The estate was acquired by Allied in 1963 to be used as a conference and training center. Pleasantdale’s twenty-two bedrooms could accommodate 34 guests. It was in constant use year round, with seminars, meetings and other functions being held every day of the working week. In 1995, the Knowles, a local family of fifth generation restaurateurs, acquired the property to continue its operation as a retreat, adding a special occasion facility for conferences and weddings.

North Stratford Railroad

The North Stratford Railroad was an interstate railroad in northeastern Vermont and northwestern New Hampshire. It ran from the village of North Stratford, New Hampshire (in the town of Stratford) to the village of Beecher Falls in Canaan, Vermont, a distance of approximately .
History.
Origin of the line.
The line was originally conceived by George van Dyke, who owned large tracts of forest in Vermont and Quebec. Starting in 1883, van Dyke obtained the following charters to build the line, listed from south to north:
Construction began in 1887 on the second section of the Upper Coos Railroad of New Hampshire between North Stratford, where the railroad connected to the Grand Trunk Railway, and Stewartstown, New Hampshire. Operations started the same year. A bridge across the Connecticut River from Stewartstown to Beecher Falls was built in 1888, and the Upper Coos Railroad of Vermont was completed north to the border a few months later. In Canada, of track of the Hereford Railroad from the border near Beecher Falls north to Cookshire, Quebec were laid in 1889, allowing interchange with the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1890 the final of track in Quebec were laid to Lime Ridge, which allowed interchange with the Quebec Central Railway in Dudswell, Quebec. Construction south of North Stratford took longer, and the entire section went into service in 1891. In this area, the line connected to the Boston and Maine Railroad in Lancaster, New Hampshire, again at Waumbeck Junction in Jefferson, New Hampshire, and then met the Maine Central Railroad at Quebec Junction in Carroll, New Hampshire.
Maine Central Railroad.
In 1890, the Maine Central Railroad gained control of the line through a series of leases. The MEC operated the line without fanfare until 1925, when it canceled its lease with the Hereford Railroad. After an extended legal battle, the tracks from the border north to Malvina, Quebec were removed. In 1948, the MEC negotiated trackage rights with the Grand Trunk Railway and the Boston and Maine Railroad between North Stratford and Lancaster. This rendered of track in Vermont and in New Hampshire redundant, and the rails were removed. Traffic on the section from North Stratford to Beecher Falls remained sufficient to keep the line open through the 1960s, but had declined enough by the early 1970s that the MEC embargoed the line after floods in 1973. The MEC filed for abandonment, but was forced to reopen the line in 1974.
North Stratford Railroad.
In 1976 the state of New Hampshire bought the track between North Stratford and Beecher Falls from MEC, which had finally obtained permission to abandon it. A separate, short section of track between Waumbeck Junction and Quebec Junction was abandoned by the MEC at this time as well. The state chartered the North Stratford Railroad Corporation to operate the line, which primarily serviced a furniture plant in Beecher Falls. Traffic tappered off as the main shipper moved more and more goods by truck, and the line was embargoed in 1989.

Frechites

Frechites is an early Triassic ammonite, a kind of cephalopod with an external shell, included in the ceratitid family Beyrichitidae. 
Taxonomic revision.
J.P. Smith, 1932, put "Frechites" in the Ceratididae where it remained included in the Treatise Part L. It was later removed to the Beyrichitidae, established by Spath, 1934.
Comparative morphology.
The shell of "Frechites" is robust, involute, and strongly ribbed. The outer whorl embraces most of the inner, leaving a small umbilicus. Short, strong ribs appear along the umbilical shoulder that split in twos and threes in the middle of the sides, which continue to the outer, or ventrolateral, shoulder but do not cross the venter, or outer rim, which is left smooth.
The suture of "Frechites" is partly ammonitic, with a slightly serrate first lateral saddle. The other saddles in the suture are rounded and smooth. As such this is intermediate between common Ceratitidae with entirely ceratite sutures -smooth saddes, serrate lobes, and the normal Beyrichideae with sutures that tend to be ammonitic or subammonitid, with deep serrated lobes and high serrated saddles.

Frechiella

Frechiella is an ammonite with a smooth, somewhat globose involute shell that lived during the later part of the Early Jurassic, which has been found in England and Italy. The shell is coiled so that the outer whorls cover most of the inner, leaving the inner whorls only slightly exposed. The outer rim, known as the venter, is broadly arched, with either a low narrow keel bordered by small grooves, or a large median groove. 
"Frechiella" is included in the Hildoceratidae, a family of Jurassic ammonoid cephalopods that are part of the Hildocerataceae.

Upon the opening of said light rail system, North Irving Transit Center was closed off and all routes are modified/diverted to Las Colinas Urban Center and University of Dallas Stations. However, it reopened on December 3rd.
Throughout the Transit Center's dormancy, it's parking lot remained available for customers taking the Orange Line light rail service from Irving Convention Center Station. Access to the station platform is available via a walkway and pedestrian crossing under Northwest Highway.
There had been talks of reopening North Irving Transit Center as a Bus Plaza connecting Irving Convention Center Station sometime in December 2012. This was reached as a goal to improve transfer opportunities between Irving/Las Colinas buses as well as bus/rail connections. With that said, a number of routes were relocated from Las Colinas Urban Center Station to the Irving Convention Center Station and/or the North Irving Transit Center. Some of these routes will connect Irving Convention Center Station and the North Irving Transit Center directly, and customers will have an option to either walk or take a bus for this connection.

Hacker groups provided access to information and resources, and a place to learn from other members. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with an elite group. The names of hacker groups parody large corporations, governments, police and criminals; and often used specialized orthography.

Beyrichoceras is a genus belonging to the Goniatitid family, Muensteroceratidae
, a group of ammonoids, extinct shelled cephalopods related to belemnites and recent coleoids and more distantly to the nautiloids
Description.
"Beyrichoceratoides" has a smooth involute discoidal shell with a very narrow umbilicus, non-crenulate biconvex growth lines, and well-developed ventro-lateral salients and deep hyponomic sinus. The ventral lobe of the suture is moderately narrow and straight sided; bifuracated with short prongs separated by a low median saddle. The first lateral and umbilical lobes are like those of "Beyrichoceras", broad and V-shaped, only the first lateral one is more symmetrical in "Beyrichoceratoides". The internal dorsal and flanking lobes are also like those of "Beyrichoceras" but with the flanking lobes set relatively further apart.
Derivation and Taxonomy.
"Beyrichoceratoides" was derived from "Muensteroceras" near the beginning of the Carboniferous (early Mississippian) and is included in the Muesteroceratidae, a family assigned to the Goniatitid superfamily Pericyclaceae. 
Beyrichoceratoides was named by Bisat in 1924, based on Goniatites implicatus Phillips, 1836. Schindewolf, 1951, considered Beyrichoceratoides equivalent to "Münsteroceras" Hyatt 1884 as also presented in the Treatise Part L,1957. Ruzhentsev,1960, considered "Beyrichoceratoide" a distinct genus as do Korn 2006 and Nikolaeva 2008.
Distribution and Range.
"Beyrichoceratoides" has been found in the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) of Great Britain 
Paleoecology.
"Beyrichoceratoides" has been described as a "fast-moving nektonic carnivore". However its somewhat globular discoidal form suggest a small stalking or houvering nektonic or nekto-benthic ambush predator capable of sudden swift movements to either grab prey or escape predation. As with all known cephalopods, Beyrichoceratoides was undoubtedly carnivorous.

Beyrichoceras

Beyrichoceras is a genus belonging to the Goniatitid family, Maxigoniatitidae that lived during the Mississippian Period (Early Carboniferous)
Description.
"Beyrichoceras" can be recognized by its small, thickly discoidal shell with small umbilicus, deep dorsal impression, arched flanks and rounded venter The ventral lobe of the suture is bifurcated, wide at its base, narrowing adapically, ending in a pair of outwardly turned prongs separated by a low median saddle. The first lateral lobe is similar in size to the ventral lobe; broad, V-shaped, and more or less symmetrical. The umbilical lobe, like the first lateral lobe, is broad, V-shaped, and fairly symmetrical, only much shallower. The dorsal lobe is long and narrow, closely flanked by narrow internal lobes.
Taxonomic position.
"Beyrichoceras" is presently assigned to the Maximitidae, although some authors have assigned it to the Muensteroceratidae or Anthracoceratidae. Miller and Furnish included "Beyrichoceras" in the subfamily Goniatitinae, family Goniatitidae, and superfamily Goniatitaceae. The Maxigoniatitidae, established by Korn, Klug & Mapes, 1999, is based on "Goniatites maximus" var. "saourensis" Pareyn, 1961, renamed "Maxigoniatites"
Distribution and Range.
"Beyrichoceras" is found in midde Lower Carboniferous ( Mississippian upper Osagean-Meremacian equivalent) strata in North America, Europe, and North Africa.
Paleoecology.
"Beyrichoceras" has been described as a "fast-moving nektonic carnivore". Its small, involutely coiled form nevertheless suggest a floating nektonic or nekto-benthic stalker capable to sudden swift maneuvering. As with all known cephalopods, "Beyrichoceras" was undoubtedly carnivorous

Beyrichites

Beyrichites is an extinct genus in the ammonoid cephalopod, order Ceratitida from the Lower and Middle Triassic of southern Europe, Asia, and western North America. 
"Beyrichites" has an involute, discoidal shell with a narrowly arched venter and signoidal ribbing that tends to disappear on the outer whorl. The suture is subammonitic, meaning the saddles are serrate as well as the lobs.
Two subgenera are recognized: "B. (Beyrichites)" from the Lower and Middle Triassic, which has no tubercles, and "B. (Gangadharites)" from the Middle Triassic of the Himalaya which has tbercles on the whorl sides.

The Duke's Mistress

"The Duke's Mistress" is a Caroline era stage play, a tragicomedy written by James Shirley and first published in 1638. It was the last of Shirley's plays produced before the major break in his career: with the closing of the London theatres due to bubonic plague in May 1636, Shirley left England for Ireland, where he worked under John Ogilby at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin for four years.
"The Duke's Mistress" was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 18 January 1636, and was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. On 22 February 1636 it was performed at St. James's Palace before the King and Queen, Charles I and Henrietta Maria.
The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 13 March 1638 and was published in quarto later that year, printed by John Norton for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, the partners who issued many of Shirley's plays in that era. Curiously, surviving copies of the quarto differ in identification of the publishers; some copies name Crooke alone, while others mention only Cooke.
The play shares some clear similarities with contemporaneous works like "The Queen and Concubine" by Richard Brome and "A Wife for a Month" by John Fletcher. Shirley's use of the idea of men who are attracted to ugly women has provoked commentary on the psychological and other aspects of such a fixation.
Synopsis.
"The Duke's Mistress" employs the three-level plot structure that Shirley favors through much of his output. In the main plot, Dionisio Farnese, the Duke of Parma, tries to dismiss his faithful wife Euphemia and win Ardelia as his mistress. The secondary plot reverses the main plot situation: Leontio, Farnese's kinsman and heir, loves the Duchess, and plans to murder the Duke and take his place. In the comic subplot, Horatio woos Ardelia's waiting-woman Fiametta, only to abandon her to pursue another; Horatio has an obsession with homely women — the homelier they are, the more strongly he is attracted to them.
The play opens with a celebration in Ardelia's favor — which is interrupted by Duchess Euphemia, who melodramatically begs her husband to put her to death now that she has lost his affection. A crucial misunderstanding occurs when Ardelia, not having heard the Duchess's plea and being ignorant of its nature, tells the Duke that he should fulfill the Duchess's request, whatever it is. The Duchess vows revenge on her husband and Ardelia. Farnese incarcerates his wife, and places his heir Leontio in charge of her; he already suspects Leontio's attraction for her.
In the midst of this, Bentivolio, Ardelia's fiancé, returns to the Duke's court after an absence. He accuses Ardelia of betrayal of their engagement. When the Duke arrives, Ardelia hides Bentivolio, and while he listens from hiding she manipulates Farnese into an admission that she has not yet submitted to him sexually. But a courtier named Valerio knows the situation of Bentivolio and Ardelia, and threatens to expose Bentivolio to the Duke's anger unless Ardelia sleeps with him, Valerio. Playing for time, Ardelia arranges a meeting with Valerio. 
Leontio has bribed Pallante, a captain, to assassinate the Duke. Valerio overhears their plot, and joins their conspiracy. He also prevails upon Bentivolio to kill the Duke, assuring him that the new Duke, Leontio, will offer a pardon.
In her chamber, Ardelia resists Valerio, and when he tries to rape her she draws a pistol on him. Bentivolio arrives; Valerio, thinking the Duke has come, hides behind a tapestry. Bentivolio, likewise mistaking the man behind the arras, runs him through with his sword (as Hamlet does to Polonius in "Hamlet," III,iv). Thinking he has killed the Duke, Bentivolio flees with Ardelia.
Pallante comes to Leontio, telling him that he has killed Farnese, who repented of his crimes and sins before he died. Then Bentivolio and Ardelia are brought in, apprehended by the guards; and Bentivolio too admits to having killed the Duke. Leontio opportunistically sends the lovers to prison for the crime, thus throwing suspicion from himself and his henchman. Leontio rushes to the Duchess, to stake his claim to Farnese's wife as well as his dukedom — but the still-living Farnese is with her. Pallante lied about the Duke's death, but told the truth about Farnese's repentance — for that is what caused the assassin to spare his victim's life. Believing the Duke is dead, Leontio mistakes Farnese for one of his own servants; Leontio carelessly tells Euphemia that Farnese's death leaves her free for him. Euphemia rejects Leontio, and Farnese kills him. The Duke and Duchess reconcile, and Bentivolio and Ardelia marry.

Beudanticeras

Beudanticeras is an extinct cephalopod genus from the Cretaceous period belonging to the ammonoid subclass and included in the family Desmoceratidae.
"Beudanticeras" has a rather to very compressed shell that is moderately involute, with convex to flat sides and a narrowly arched out rim. Coiling is such that the outer whorl embraces much of the next inner whorl, leaving a small spiraled umblicus. The shell is generally smooth but may have weak ribs but no tubercles. The suture is ammonitic.
The derivation of "Beudanticeras" may be from "Uhligella", although "Uhligella" is partly contemporary with early "Beudanticeras". Other related genera include "Beudantiella", "Brewericeras", "Zurcherella", and possibly "Pseudosaynella".

Tillari (Forebay) Dam

Tilari (Forebay) Dam is situated in Dodamarg Taluka, in the Indian state of Maharashtra and the largest one is situated in Chandgad taluk of Kolhapur District in Maharashtra and is constructed on Tilari River as the result of a joint project by the Maharashtra and Goa governments. The water from this dam is distributed to both states. The dam is located near the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka and necessitated the relocation of several villages in the area. There are many reservoirs. The largest one is located near Belgaum in a village named Hajgoli in Maharashtra. The village is approximately 30 km from Belgaum and is a weekend spot for the people of that town.
"There has been no official ribbon-cutting function, no fanfare and no announcements, but the Rs 15 billion Tilari dam, a joint venture between Goa and Maharashtra, is now complete. The construction of the dam began in 1986."
"The Tillari dam was completed in all respects in May 2009," S Paramasivan, managing director of the Tillari irrigation development corporation told TOI on Wednesday. "The topmost layer of the gorge-filling was completed in 2008 but the stone pitching and the erection of the four spillway gates was completed in May 2009," Paramasivan said."
The full storage of the Tillari dam will however only be done after two seasons considering the stability of the dam. "Since this is an earthen dam, the storage has to be raised in stages. But as far as Goa is concerned, the dam is complete," Paramasivan said.
The dam may have been completed now, but the waters of the Tillari dam began flowing into Goa long time back. The right bank main canal running up to Pernem was inaugurated on 19 December 2001, and the left bank main canal running into Bicholim was inaugurated on 16 February 2007.
Presently, the dam water meets the drinking water and industrial demands of three talukas in North Goa: Bicholim, Pernem and Bardez. Tillari supplies 7.5 million litres per day to the Chandel water treatment plant in Pernem and 90 million litres per day to the Assonora water treatment plant in Bardez. "But this is only because the treatment plants do not have the capacity to treat more water. PWD is increasing the capacity and we can supply whatever quantum of water they need," Paramasivan said.
Presently the right bank main canal supplies per day to Pernem and the left bank main canal supplies per day to Bicholim. But the original project provision is for the supply of per day from the year 2011 onwards.
The total irrigation potential of the Tillari irrigation project in Goa is 1862 hectares, comprising 1139 hectares on the right bank main canal and 723 hectare on the left. But as of March 2009, only 301 hectares have been brought under cultivation on the right bank main canal and 165 hectares on the left bank main canal. While a total of 466 hectares have been brought under cultivation, the balance 1396 hectares will be brought under cultivation during 2009–10, Paramasivan said.
The original estimated cost of the project in 1986 was Rs 2.12 billion. Now it has risen to about Rs 15 billion. Of this, Goa's liability is about Rs 11 billion.

Ermengol I, Count of Urgell

Ermengol (or Armengol) I (974–1010), called "el de Córdoba", was the Count of Urgell from 992 to his death. He was the second son of Borrell II of Barcelona and his first wife, Letgarda. He was the second of the counts of Urgel and famous mainly for his participation in the Reconquista.
A man of culture, Ermengol was open to influences from wider Europe and he made two voyages to Rome, in 998 and 1001. He was a stimulus to his nobles in making pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela or Le Puy. He also reformed the judiciary of his county to make justice more available to all. He also began to reassert his authority over the outlying castles of his realm, whose lords were acting independent of his power.
He also maintained an intense war against the Caliphate of Córdoba. In 1003, Urgell was invaded by Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar. Aided by Raymond Borrel of Barcelona, Bernard I of Besalú, and Wifred II of Cerdagne, Ermengol defeated them at the Battle of Torà, followed by the tighter Battle of Albesa. He was captured by Abdelmelik, the Córdoban "hajib", during reprisals in the summer, but was free by March 1004. In 1008, he led several successful expeditions against the Moors. In 1010, he participated in the expedition of his brother Raymond Borrel of Barcelona against Córdoba itself. He died nearby at Castell de Bacar, thirty seven years of age .
Family.
Before 10 July 1000, Ermengol married Tetberga, presumably a daughter of Artaud I, Count of Forez, by his wife Tetberga of Limoges. Tetberga died between 7 April and 3 November 1005, when Ermengol's second wife is first mentioned. As his second wife, Ermengol married Guisla (Gisela), whose family is not known, but who could be the homonymous daughter of Gausfred I of Roussillon, named in her father's will in February 989. She survived him and was still alive on 18 November 1010. From this second union came two children:

Founder.
Hinshaw's was founded by Ezra Bushong Hinshaw, who was born 4 April 1899, in Windsor, North Carolina and raised in Boise, Idaho. He was raised in the Quaker faith. Prior to opening his own store he had been a manager of a Montgomery Ward store and, after relocating to California, became the president of the C.C. Anderson Department Store, a local company in Whittier.[http://www.rawbw.com/~hinshaw/cgi-bin/id?1374]
Locations.
The first Hinshaw's location was on the southwest corner of Baldwin Avenue and Duarte in the Arcadia Hub shopping area of Arcadia, California. This store opened in 1951, and ultimately grew to contain of retail space. It was the main anchor of the Baldwin Avenue shopping strip, and the only large department store in Arcadia until a branch of The May Company opened several years later.
In the mid-1950s, Hinshaw's opened a second branch, this in the new Whittier Quad Shopping Center in Whittier. Hinshaw's was one of two anchor stores in the quad, its complement being another branch of The May Company. The Whittier branch of Hinshaw's also had of space. Both branches had multi-level parking garages despite their suburban locations.
The Whittier Quad shopping center was badly damaged by the Whittier Narrows earthquake of 1987, but Hinshaw's building suffered the least damage and remained open as the center's only tenant for several years. Sales were poor, and remained down even after the rest of the Quad was rebuilt, and the company announced the store's closure in December 1991. The company had been at that time the last surviving independent department store chain in Los Angeles County. Hinshaw's Arcadia location remained open for a number of years after that, prospering for a while but ultimately closing in the face of competition from the nearby Westfield Santa Anita shopping center, which underwent a major expansion in the 1990s. The Hinshaws reopened and stays open as a Burlington Coat Factory store, which opened in 1998-1999.

The 47 class are a class of diesel-electric locomotives built by A Goninan & Co for the Public Transport Commission in 1972/73.
History.
Twenty were ordered from A Goninan & Co with the first delivered in July 1972. After undergoing acceptance trails the first entered service in September 1972 with the last delivered in May 1973. Originally intended for use hauling coal services in the Hunter Valley, they were allocated to Bathurst to operate services in the state's west from Lithgow to Euabalong West, Bourke and Cootamundra and all branches in between. Their excellent ride qualities saw them find favour with crews, although they did suffer from overheating with one destroyed by fire in April 1974 and another in a collision in March 1977.
In January 1981 it was decided to transfer the class to Broadmeadow to take up the duties they had originally been built for being used to haul coal services from Belmont, Dudley, Lambton and Pelton. They also saw use on services to Werris Creek, Tamworth and Moree. They continued to return to Bathurst Workshops for overhaul. A downturn in traffic as a result of a drought saw them placed in store at Parkes in 1982/83 before all were reactivated in 1984 resuming duties out of Broadmeadow.
In 1987 4719 was withdrawn from service and stored at Bathurst Workshops as a source parts to keep sister units working, being joined by 4715 in November 1988. In 1989 both were moved from to Cardiff Workshops to be rebuilt as HTV2000, a Heavy Test Vehicle.
Despite their favouritism with crews, their high maintenance costs saw them selected for withdrawal in 1989 with only six in service or under repair by November 1989 with the last being taken out of service in December 1990.
In 1990 the Lachlan Valley Railway purchased 47s 01 and 08 followed in February 1994 by 02, 03, 07 and 16. A later purchase was 4717. These were used to operate wheat services in the Cowra region in 1993/94.
In June 1999 they commenced operating trip working services between Port Botany and the Cooks River container terminal in Sydney for Lachlan Valley Rail Freight followed in July 1999 by a service between Cooks River and Carrington for R&H Transport Services.
Five Lachlan Valley Railway units remain in service, primarily operating infrastructure trains for Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

Northe was born in Traralgon, Victoria and attended Traralgon High School, completing Year 11 in 1982. In 2006, Northe completed a Certificate IV in Business.
Political & Parliamentary Career.
Utilising repetitive television advertising and campaigning on the issues of workers rights and bicycle paths, Northe was able to capitalise on divisions within some local branches of the Australian Labor Party to win the seat. Northe doubled The Nationals primary vote, secured with the aid of Liberal Party and ex-Labor independent preferences.
This win also served to help secure The Nationals future as a political party in Victoria. Russell Northe joined fellow parliamentarians Peter Ryan and Peter Hall as The Nationals state parliamentary representatives for Gippsland.
At the 2010 state election, Northe achieved the biggest pro-Coalition swing in the state to transform Morwell into one of the National Party's safest Victorian seats, with a two-party-preferred margin of 16.29% against Labor. Northe won Morwell on the primary vote, polling 56.24% in his own right, and won every polling booth except the small Yallourn North booth, where Labor recorded a narrow majority. With the Liberal/Nationals Coalition winning government, Northe was also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business.
Northe has served on the Parliament's Rural and Regional Committee since 2007.

Yinoceras is a genus belonging to the yicoceratin subfamily of the Pseudohaloritidae, a family of the goniatitid order of extinct ammonoids. 
The shell of "Yinoceras" is involute, small to intermediate in size, subglobular or thickly discoidal with a very small umbilicus, convex flanks, and rounded venter. The surface is usually marked by weak constrictions and is characterized at maturity by coarse transverse ribs that bifurcale or sometimes trifurcate. The siphuncle is proportionally large and retrochoanitic (meaning the septal necks point toward the beginning of the shell); ventro-marginal in the first whorl but then migrates rapidly to become dorsal. The suture is goniatitic. 
The retrochoanitic siphuncle is more usual for earlier, Devonian, ammonoids and is a characteristic of the Nautiloidea. The dorsal siphuncle, characteristic of the Upper Devonian Clymeniida may say something about the orientation of "Yinoceras" during life.

Michael Ferguson was well known as a founder member of the West Belfast Safer Streets Campaign Group. Through this work he challenged anti-social behaviour, developed initiatives to tackle crime and created opportunities for young people to contribute positively to the community.
Illness and death.
Ferguson died on 24 September 2006 from testicular cancer. He had spoken about the illness to the Irish News (a Belfast-based daily newspaper), saying "Men are neglectful of their own health and do not visit their doctors." Tributes following his death came from across the political divide with SDLP councillor Patricia Lewsley remarking that he was a "colourful character who will be missed by many members of the political family" and Ulster Unionist MLA Billy Bell saying that he was "not only an energetic political opponent, but more importantly he was a dedicated family man". The Teeling Roundabout (also referred to as Poleglass Roundabout) at Upper Dumurry Lane has been informally renamed the "Michael Ferguson Roundabout" in the late community activist's memory. He had a personal interest in environmental and horticultural issues and won a number of awards for environmental improvement schemes. This is marked by the annual flower bed competition in which pupils from local schools are invited to design the flower beds for the roundabout.

New South Wales 48 class locomotive

The 48 Class are a class of diesel locomotives built by AE Goodwin, Auburn for the New South Wales Government Railways between 1959 and 1970. Once the most ubiquitous locomotive in New South Wales (and Australia), they are based on Alco frames and prime movers, using General Electric (later Associated Electrical Industries) electrical equipment. The South Australian Railways 830 and Silverton Rail 48s classes are of a very similar design.
History.
The 48 Class were ordered to commence the conversion of branch lines to diesel traction with the first entering service in September 1959. Further orders saw 165 in service by October 1970. There were three versions:
As well as branch lines they operated both main line and metropolitan services on every line in the state. Aside from a couple written off after accidents in the mid-1980s, withdrawals didn't commence in earnest until August 1994. In December 1994 the first Mark 1s were sold. By June 1997 FreightCorp's fleet was down to 120 units.
Others have been withdrawn since and as at January 2014, 66 remained in service primarily with Pacific National. GrainCorp, Greentrains, Junee Railway Workshop and RailCorp also operate some.
Railway Services Authority/RailCorp.
Two were transferred by the State Rail Authority to the Railway Service Authority, these have since passed to RailCorp
Silverton Rail/Greentrains.
In December 1994 Silverton Rail purchased six from FreightCorp. All were placed in service as their Silverton Rail 48s class. Some of these remain in service in January 2014 in the ownership of Greentrains.
Australian National/Genesee & Wyoming Australia.
In December 1994 Australian National purchased two from FreightCorp with 4813 rebuilt as DA7 for the narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway and 4826 scrapped some years later at Port Augusta. As at January 2014 it remains in service with Genesee & Wyoming Australia renumbered 906.
Austrac Ready Power/Junee Railway Workshop.
Austrac Ready Power purchased four from a scrap dealer and placed three in service on their various services. Following Austrac ceasing all passed to Junee Railway Workshop.
Cargill Australia.
In February 1997 4812 was rebuilt and repainted by FreightCorp at Delec Locomotive Depot for Cargill Australia for use as a shunter at their Kooragang Island plant numbered CAR1. It was sold to Junee Railway Workshop.
GrainCorp.
GrainCorp have purchased 18 Mark 3s and are having them overhauled by Junee Railway Workshop at which point they are renumbered into the 482xx series.
PL class.
Seven Mark 2 locomotives were rebuilt by FreightCorp between 1999 and 2001 as the PL (for PortLink) class. Changes included the short end cab nose being lowered, the cab altered, and the installation of air-conditioning. They were designed to operate in push-pull formation on intermodal container trains between Port Botany and Clyde/Yennora.
PL1 and PL2 were transferred to South Australia after the sale of FreightCorp to Pacific National for use at Keswick Terminal shunting for Great Southern Rail which was prior a National Rail contract. PL2 was transferred back to NSW with PL1 remaining in South Australia. In NSW the class saw use on the former South Maitland Railway hauling coal along with 48 class locos. After a long period of storage at Kooragang Island, PL2, PL3, PL5, PL6 and PL7 were scrapped in 2013.
Preserved.
Currently there are seven preserved locomotives, four of them operational:

Murray Irrigation Area

The Murray Irrigation Area is geographically located within the Riverina area of New South Wales, between Mulwala and Moulamein. It was created to control and divert the flow of local river and creek systems for the purpose of food production. The main river system feeding and fed by the area is the Murray River.
Much of the water is supplied via the Mulwala Canal, flowing from Lake Mulwala. Water supply is provided by Murray Irrigation Limited, a company formed by the New South Wales government in 1995. Murray Irrigation purchases water directly from the New South Wales State Water Corporation.
The system is regarded as a major engineering achievement comprising an elaborate series of weirs, canals and holding ponds (fed by upstream rivers and dams), including the large Lawson syphon where the Mulwala Canal flows under the Edward River.
Anabranches of the Murray including the Edward River and the Wakool River are also managed to provide irrigation water to irrigators along those waterways. Managed flow along those waterways bears little correlation to natural flow regimes, with peak flows occurring during peak irrigation demand (summer) rather than during peak runoff (early spring).
Irrigated agriculture is the main industry of the towns within the area which include Finley, Deniliquin and Jerilderie.
The irrigation area has become increasingly controversial in the early 21st century, after consecutive years of drought and a growing Australian population have led to demands for greater levels of water conservation.

Buick Centieme

The Buick Centieme is a concept car that was produced for the 2003 North American International Auto Show in Detroit by the Buick Division of General Motors. Its styling provided the basis for the later Buick Enclave show and production vehicles.
Development.
Borrowing from the French word for '100th', the Centieme was so named to commemorate the Buick Motor Division's 100th anniversary (compare the Cadillac Cien). The Centieme was similar is size and shape to the existing Rendezvous crossover, but lower, wider, and marginally longer. Power came from an experimental 400 hp 3.6 L twin-turbocharged V6 engine mated to the Hydra-Matic 4T65-E 4-speed transmission.
The Centieme was designed to showcase the possible direction of Buick interior styling. The entire interior - including the six captain's chairs - was upholstered in leathers of various grains and colors, including a woven-leather floor. The gauge cluster used aluminum accents with olive ash wood inserts for the trim. The interior featured ambient lighting.
The Bertone-designed exterior featured short front and rear overhangs, rode on 22-inch aluminum wheels, and was painted in Canyon Mist metallic tricoat.
Legacy.
Some of the Centieme's exterior design and interior features later showed up on the 2008 Buick Enclave crossover.
The Buick Centieme was sold by GM at a 2009 Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale.

Bush Radio (South Africa)

Bush Radio is a popular and pioneering community radio station in South Africa. It broadcasts from Cape Town on 89.5 MHz FM, with a music and talk format aimed at the 18 to 39 age group. 
Early life.
Bush Radio started out as a project of the Cassette Education Trust during the last stages of the struggle against apartheid. Its programmes were distributed on cassette tape. Many of its volunteers and programmers were students from the University of the Western Cape, which did not at the time have its own campus radio station.
After being denied broadcast licenses on two occasions by South Africa's broadcast regulator, the station launched as an illegal pirate radio station on April 25, 1993, but was shut down by authorities within a few hours. With the democratization of South Africa around the time of the 1994 elections, however, the station was soon granted a temporary broadcasting license, becoming one of the first media outlets in South Africa not owned by either the government or a commercial media company. Due to bureaucratic difficulties surrounding the country's transition to democracy, however, the station only received yearly temporary license renewals until being granted its first permanent broadcasting license in 2002.
In its original incarnation, the station was led by Edric Gorfinkel. Once the station became a licensed operation, its management was taken over by Zane Ibrahim, who oversaw the station's transformation from an anti-apartheid activist project into a broader community-oriented broadcaster. Station volunteer Lumko Mtimde was also tapped to head the National Community Radio Forum, an organization which helped to establish a legislative and collaborative framework for the establishment and expansion of community radio in South Africa, and later became a member of South Africa's new broadcast regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority.
In 2000 Bush Radio received one of the Prince Claus Awards in the theme "Urban Heroes".

Eric Tingstad

Eric Tingstad (born December 16, 1954) is an American Grammy Award-winning multi-genre record producer, musician and songwriter / composer. He was born and raised in Seattle, WA where he currently resides. Best known as a fingerstyle guitarist, Tingstad has performed, recorded, and produced Alternative Country, Blues, Americana, Rock, Smooth Jazz and Ambient / New Age music. Tingstad frequently collaborates with woodwinds player Nancy Rumbel as the acclaimed Tingstad and Rumbel duo. He is also a principal founder, producer, electric guitarist and co-writer with The Halyards, a Seattle-based American roots rock band that includes Carl Funk and Larry Mason.
Background.
Eric Tingstad cites early rock and roll influences such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and King Crimson. Other influences include The Kingston Trio, Flatt and Scruggs, pianist and composer Martin Denny, sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, Mason Williams’ “Classical Gas” and the Hawaiian slack-key guitar. In the mid 1970s, while playing lead guitar and bass with Seattle-based rock band Pegasus, Tingstad began studies under masters of techniques pioneered by Spanish classical guitarist and innovator Andrés Segovia. Those techniques, combined with innovations of his own, have shaped Tingstad’s stylings and the instrumental compositions for which he is known. His innovative work inspired Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, to create the Windham Hill Guitar Sampler series. Tingstad's Prelude from the Bridal Suite is a selected pick on AllMusic.com from the first Windham Hill Guitar Sampler.
By a vote of his peers, he was honored in October 2006 with the Coyote Award from Arts Northwest commemorating his leadership, visibility, and contributions to the constant change in the arena of live performance. he is also known for his philanthropic and community service work in regard to historical preservation, land trust and environmental issues which he has actively incorporated into his compositional themes and branding.
Recordings.
Eric Tingstad’s solo recording career began in 1982 with the release of "On The Links". Capitalizing on his gift for composition, On the Links compiled eleven original songs best described as part of the burgeoning New Age genre. The album appeared on his private label, Cheshire Records, under which he continues to release albums of his own music and others.
In 1985, Eric began a collaboration with woodwinds player Nancy Rumbel. Their debut album, "The Gift", an acoustic Christmas collection, was very well received, selling ten thousand copies in the first ten weeks. The Gift went on to sell over half a million copies, and remains a best-selling Christmas album.
In 1987 Tingstad signed a multi-album record contract with Narada Productions which led to 14 recordings from 1987 to 2004. The catalog is now owned and distributed worldwide by EMI Capitol. In 1988 Tingstad and Rumbel collaborated with pianist David Lanz to form and record the Woodlands trio which resulted in a best-selling CD called Woodlands.
In 1998 the double album, American Acoustic was honored as "Acoustic Instrumental Album of the Year". It debuted at number one on Adult Contemporary charts and spent 10 weeks on the Billboard radio charts. In 2000, Tingstad & Rumbel were invited to perform at Carnegie Hall.
Tingstad won a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 2003 as artist, engineer, and producer of Tingstad and Rumbel's, Acoustic Garden. He continues to tour as part of Tingstad and Rumbel, an acoustic duo that remains a standard among listeners of the instrumental/New Age genres.
In 2007 Tingstad recorded "Southwest", an instrumental album inspired by the landscapes of the American Southwest region featuring compositions in the style of what he considers "Ambient-Americana". Tingstad received a Grammy nomination for Southwest’s recording.
In 2012 Tingstad released his instrumental Americana recording Badlands, which includes an appearance by dobro and steel guitar legend Cindy Cashdollar. Badlands continues in the ambient-Americana style, deriving influence from Native American music, along with country and roots genres.

Panglong

Panglong () can refer to one of three towns in Shan State. Of them, the most well known one is Panglong, where the Panglong Conference took place. Second, Panglong in the Wa regions near the China border is a town founded by Chinese Muslim settlers in the trans-Salween Wa States. Third, Panglong in northern Shan State, a ruby mining town.
Panglong, located in southern Shan State, Myanmar (formerly Burma), was host to the Panglong Conference. 
Since 1957, Panglong serves as the Headquarters of the Shan monastic education under the administration of the Shan State Sangha Council, with its main base at Wat Pitakat. The Shan State Sangha Councial is also responsible for the project of translating the Buddhist canonical texts, tipitaka, into Shan language. The project was originally founded and sponsored by Sao Shwe Thaike, the Saopha (ruling prince) of Yawnghwe State and the first president of the Union of Burma (now Myanmar).
The town is also home to Panglong University.
The following piece of work is about Panglong in the Wa regions in Northeast Shan State.
In addition to the main settlement of Panglong, two other smaller Panthay villages, Panyao and Pachang, were established about 12 miles distant to the south and east respectively, 'which had about eighty houses'. The dominant group in the villages were the Panthay, chiefly Hui migrants from Dali, Baoshan, Shanning, Menghua and elsewhere in southern and western Yunnan. James George Scott comments that these Chinese Muslims were 'all merchants, mule-owners and men of substance'; indeed, considering this wealth Scott concluded that it was only the military prowess and superior armaments of the Panthay which kept their annual tribute to the ruler of Son Mu fixed at the low figure of 100 rupees per annum. The same source continues:
By the time Scott visited Panglong – at least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion – the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples. The Panthay were, generally speaking, affluent enough to employ these more recent settlers as mule-drivers and 'to do the drudgery generally'. In large measure this affluence must have been due the lifting of the Qing proscription on Hui settlement in Yunnan (c. 1888-1890), as a result of which the Panglong "Panthays" were able to re-establish trading contacts with their fellows remaining settled within Yunnan. As a result of this development, a number of the original refugees returned to China, merely maintaining agents at Panglong; certainly Scott noted that as many of the Panthay caravan traded into China as throughout the Shan States from Panglong.

Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss

"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss" is the eleventh track and the second single on the Bloodhound Gang's 2005 album "Hefty Fine". The title is an onomatopoeic representation of a typical dance beat.
Music video.
Directed by Cousin Mike and Kevin Powers of Mucky Pup, the music video consists of a party in a club called the Wiper Room, a toilet-themed parody of the real-life LA Viper Room. Among the strange things going on in the various "stalls" are a Dutch girl using a butter-churn, a woman spinning around on roller skates, the Japanese band Electric Eel Shock playing their hearts out (but with no sound), a sullen-looking gangster that holds up a chain of hearts, Clark Kent entering a stall to change clothes to Superman, what seems to be either Jim Jones (complete with Kool-aid drinking cultists) or a contemporary Jesus Christ, played by Jemaine Clement giving out wine, Telly "Leatherface" Blackwood and the Executioner "Maurico Broadway" Wrestlers from Viva La Bam were wrestling, a man in a leather jacket (mimicking George Michael from his 'Faith' video, with the word "regret" printed on the rear) dancing, a robot choking a scientist (played by David Lovering of The Pixies) who is frantically trying to control the robot, and a man made up as Tony Montana eating powdered sugar doughnuts (which previously make it appear that he is snorting cocaine).
Singer Jimmy Pop is the main focus of the video, as he is singing in a bathroom stall. An attractive girl enters the stall next to him and begins to dance. Pop spies on her through a glory hole in the wall of the stall, but happens to stop paying attention as the girl leaves and a dog enters the bathroom. One thing leads to another and before long, Pop thinks he is making out with the girl, but instead it is the dog, a fact which he does not seem to realize. In the dirty version of the music video, Pop lines himself up with the hole to receive fellatio, with the dog still on the other end. We then see him leave the bathroom and, at the end of the video, he is leaving the club with the dog and a trail of toilet paper coming off his foot. The remainder of the band appear in a few shots.
Natasha Thorp provides the voice of the female singer and appears in the video. Remixes are included by DJ Tomcraft and Scooter.

It is situated in Japan's Hida Mountains and all its major peaks besides Mount Maehotaka, lie on the border between the cities of Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, and Takayama, Gifu Prefecture. This mountain is located in Chūbu-Sangaku National Park.
The peaks of Okuhotaka, Karasawa, Kitahotaka, Maehotaka and Nishihotaka are called the Hotaka Mountains. The highest peak in this range, and also the tallest mountain in both Nagano and Gifu prefectures, is Mount Okuhotaka. Mount Hotaka is also referred to as the .
Hiking routes.
Even though the Hotaka Mountains are often climbed during times of lingering snow, like Golden Week, the following routes are strictly for snow-free periods. When snow has fallen, the area becomes extremely dangerous. Routes may become impassable, so special care is required.
The mountain climbing base at Karasawa lies in a U-shaped cirque dominated by Mount Okuhotaka, Mount Maehotaka and the Tsuri Ridge connecting the two. Because it lies on the northern side of the mountains, snow remains throughout the year.
To the north, beyond a steep descent and ascent at the Daikiretto, the ridge continues across , , ending at Mount Yari. In the south, a ridge stretches from Mount Okuhotaka via Mount Nishihotaka to Mount Yake. The Tsuri Ridge runs from Mount Okuhotaka to Mount Maehotaka, from where a path leads down through a cirque to the bridge Kappabashi in Kamikōchi.

Energy regeneration brake

The energy regeneration brake was the trade name for a system designed to automatically switch an electric motor into a generator as a vehicle slowed. Braking energy is absorbed so that batteries can be recharged, thus increasing the range of the automobile. The experimental Amitron, designed by American Motors, was the first car that used this regenerative braking technology, which has now become standard on all electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids.
Design.
The "energy regeneration brake" system was developed in 1967 by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in cooperation with Gulton Industries (acquired by Mark IV Industries in 1986) for an experimental battery powered city car. This concept car was called Amitron, a completely battery powered urban vehicle, and its later iteration, the Electron. To achieve longer battery life between charges, the Amitron would have a "regenerative braking system" to generate battery-charging power as the car is slowed. Equipped with dual-type storage and propulsion batteries, the system was designed to be recharged while the car is cruising. The development of various methods to improve performance and range of the electric car also included significant progress for a "solid-state electronic CPU to efficiently use power and on-the-road regeneration". Research and development costs were to be split between the two companies, but at the time both AMC and Gulton were still a long way from commercialization.
This was the first use of regenerative braking technology in the U.S. However, the first vehicles to use this technology was the French Krieger Electric Carriage, a conversion of a horse-cab, with a separate electric motor in each front wheel with provision for charging the battery while descending a hill.
The AMC-Gulton automobile was capable of "nondissipative speed control" by capturing the kinetic energy that the car loses when braking; thus, energy is not wasted in heating up the brake linings. The car used a starter/generator compound motor that incorporated both series and shunt field windings. Early applications, such as on the Baker Electric Runabout and the Owen Magnetic, used many switches and modes controlled by an expensive "black box" or "drum switch" as part of their electrical system. The Amitron's electronic control of speed and regeneration was designed for efficiency and ease of use, while the "energy regeneration brake" also results in fuel savings. The concept car used batteries with a high "power-to-energy ratio" and they were also capable of repeated charging and discharging cycles. 
The AMC partnership with Gulton evolved after the U.S. Congress passed three bills known as the Electric Vehicle Development Act of 1966. The legislation provided funding for electric car research in response to the rapidly decreasing air quality caused by automobile emissions. The two firms were developing new battery based on lithium with electronics and an advanced speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. However, a nickel-cadmium battery was used for their experimental 1969 plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) Rambler American station wagon. The heavy all-electric car had good acceleration, but a limited driving range.
Legacy.
The Amitron concept car did not get beyond the prototype stage. The expensive batteries and other factors contributed to the decision of AMC to suspend testing of this vehicle. This was along with the disappearance of other electric cars as the oil pipelines began flowing again. However, the energy regeneration from braking idea was later commercialized by the Japanese, and both Ford and Chevrolet licensed it from Toyota for use in their domestic-built hybrid vehicles. In summary, the "energy regeneration brake" developed by AMC was the first automobile application of solid state electronic and maintenance-free technology to capture energy from momentum.
Name for electronic control.
During the late 2000s, a system described as "brake energy regeneration" was a misnomer for an electronic control unit used by BMW that engages the alternator during braking, while freewheeling during acceleration and limiting its horsepower draw from the car’s engine while cruising.

Blackford High School (Indiana)

Blackford High School is a public high school in Hartford City, Indiana, which includes grades 9 through 12. It is part of the Blackford County School District, and is the sole public high school serving all of Blackford County. Like the county, Blackford High School is named after Isaac Blackford.
History.
Blackford High School opened in the fall of 1969, replacing the former Hartford City High School and Montpelier High School.
Interesting facts.
Blackford High School's team colors are red, white, and black. These colors were selected from the high schools that used to exist in the county. Red came from the Roll Red Rollers. White came from the Montpelier Spartans. Black came from the Hartford City Airedales.
Blackford High School was built atop a civil defense shelter—known by students and staff as "the tunnel." The shelter has an entrance from one of the main first-floor corridors. While the use of this shelter in case of nuclear attack is no longer a major consideration, it is still used for tornado drills. It was also formerly used as storage space, including use by the drama department for storing sets and props, resulting in the nickname "tunnel rats" being applied to members of the drama club. That use, however, has been discontinued due to fire safety concerns.
Sports.
The school football team was state 2A runnerup in the 1973-1974 season, and state 2A champion in the 1974-1975 season. The 1974-1975 team, coached by Eldon Leeth, was undefeated. A second state football championship was achieved in 1979. The school baseball team twice finished second in the state championship tournament during the 1970s.

Articulation Index

In audiology, the Articulation Index (AI) is a tool used to predict the amount of speech that is audible to a patient with a specific hearing loss. The AI reading for a given patient can range from zero to one, representing the proportion of the average speech signal that is audible. The closer the AI is to one, or 100 percent, the better the person should be able to hear speech.
The AI is often used as a counseling tool since it presents an individual’s hearing loss in terms of percentage of speech missed during a typical one-on-one conversation. The AI can also be used to measure the effectiveness of hearing aids and other forms of amplification devices. 
Since the creation of the AI, there have been several proposed ways to simplify and increase its use. In 1990, Gustav Mueller and Mead Killion proposed an AI calculation involving one hundred dots on an audiogram, each of which represented an important speech frequency; the proportion of dots audible to the listener estimates the patient's AI. Unfortunately, not all areas on the audiogram (taking into account frequencies and intensity levels) are equally weighted. According to this procedure, the highest density of the audiogram dots is concentrated in the frequency region of 1-3 kHz, since this is the region containing the most speech information.

Ethmostigmus rubripes

Ethmostigmus rubripes, the giant centipede, is the largest Australasian and Asian centipede. Head and body length 7.5 to over 16 cm (6¼ inches). The body is long and flattened. Coloration is dark or greenish-brown to orange or orange-yellow with black bands, with yellow legs and antennae; southern specimens tend to have blue or dark antennae. "Ethmostigmus rubripes" also have various subspecies which may explain the many colour forms of this species.
Habitat and range.
It is found in both dry and moist habitats, usually in sheltered places such as under logs, leaf litter and bark, and under rocks. It is solitary, terrestrial and a nocturnal predator. It is common throughout Australia, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Indonesia, Southeast Asia and China.
The giant centipede has modified claws called forcipules which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey. The venom is toxic to both mammals and insects, but does not appear to be strong enough to kill large animals quickly. It can cause severe pain in humans which can last for several days but which can be relieved somewhat by the application of icepacks. Some people report "intense pain", while others claim it is no worse than a wasp sting. There has been at least one reported death from the related centipede species "Scolopendra subspinipes" in which a young girl was bitten and died.

Portland Brownstone Quarries

The Portland Brownstone Quarries are a set of historic quarries in Portland, Connecticut. The brownstone mined from these quarries was an important source for construction in the latter half of the 19th century. The stone from these quarries was used in a number of landmark buildings in Chicago, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, New Haven, Connecticut, and Hartford, Connecticut. The site was listed as a National Historic Landmark, which also placed it on the National Register of Historic Places, on May 16, 2000.,
Early history of the quarry.
Quarrying on this site began in 1690 by James Stanclift, who contracted with the town of Middletown to build stonework in exchange for a deed of land. Commercial quarrying started in 1783 when the Brainerd Quarry Company began operations. During the peak of the brownstone era, more than 1500 workers were employed by the quarries, which shipped stone on their own ships for eight months out of the year. Proceeds from the quarrying business were deeded to Wesleyan University from 1833 through 1884, and stone from the quarries was used to build many campus buildings. As tastes in buildings shifted, and concrete became the material of choice, the demand for brownstone declined. A flood in 1936 and a hurricane in 1938 flooded the quarries, ending their operations. All efforts to drain the flooded quarries have been unsuccessful; one theory is that the floods opened some underground springs, making it impossible to effectively drain the quarries.
Current use of the quarry site.
In 1994, a new operator, Connecticut Brownstone Quarries, began a small-scale quarrying operation to provide stone for restoration of brownstone buildings.
The town purchased the historic quarries and of adjacent land in 1999 and 2000.
The quarries have been leased for development as a recreation center and is currently being operated by Brownstone Exploration & Discovery Park, with the hope that awareness of the historic landmark will strengthen the local economy.
Over the years the park has gradually expanded its attractions to include scuba diving, climbing and rappelling, swimming, snorkeling, canoeing and kayaking, hiking, mountain biking, wake boarding, cliff jumping, giant inflatable toys, and challenge courses for group team building. All activities are currently available except for the campground - which is currently under construction.
There are also plans to offer educational programs at the site. Scuba diving is becoming a popular recreational use within the park, with divers coming from all over Connecticut and even some from out of state.
Zip Lines
Brownstone Park installed two zip lines that cut across the quarry in July 2007. The first line goes from the west side of the park to the peninsula at the center of the park. The second line travels south along the west side of the quarry. The lines are 750 and long respectively. For the 2010 season, the Park added another two zip lines, one of which is only accessible by climbing up an 80-foot rock wall.
Water Slide
Brownstone Park installed a water slide in July 2007.
Water Toys
A variety of water toys including kayaks, canoes, launchers, trampolines and windsurfers are available.
Wake Boarding
Several wake boarding lines are available, along with expert jumps and rails. Compliementary beginning lessons are included in the day pass.

The Wedding Bells

The Wedding Bells is an American television comedy-drama that ran on Fox from March 7 to April 6, 2007. The series was greenlighted after the network became interested in a series centered on wedding planners. The network approached David E. Kelley to create the show, and he essentially remade a rejected pilot he created for ABC in 2004 entitled "DeMarco Affairs" which starred Selma Blair, Lindsay Sloane, and Sabrina Lloyd as three sisters who inherit a wedding planner service. Though the show had a moderately strong premiere, it faded in the ratings and was cancelled after seven episodes had been produced and five episodes were aired.
Plot.
The Bell sisters, Annie (KaDee Strickland), Jane (Teri Polo) and Sammy Bell (Sarah Jones), inherited ""The Wedding Palace"" after their parents' divorce. David Conlon (Michael Landes), photographer for the wedding palace and ex-boyfriend of Annie's whose tension-filled dealings with her are clearly the result of pent-up sexual chemistry; and Russell Hawkins (Benjamin King), Jane's husband and the company COO; round off the cast.
Then there's wedding singer Ralph Snow (Chris Williams), who always aspired to be the next Lenny Kravitz, but instead is stuck crooning endless cover songs and retro medleys for unappreciative wedding guests. Amanda Pontell (Missi Pyle) adds to the frenzied scene as a former bridezilla client who becomes a board member of The Wedding Palace.
Reception.
The first two episodes of "The Wedding Bells" garnered poor reviews and low ratings. Critics cited the superficial relationships between the sisters as a weakness. Some claim that Kelley lacked the flair to write for women, after his successful run with "Ally McBeal".

Rob Cassell

Robert James Cassell (b. 28 April 1983 in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian cricketer for the Victorian Bushrangers who played in the 2002 U-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand.
Cassell is a Fast Medium Bowler with a small handful of first class and one day appearances to his name. At 188 cms, he is considered a good future prospect for Victoria at just 24 years old. 
Cassell was a highly touted youngster for the Victorian Bushrangers, but injuries limited him to just 2 First Class and 3 One Day games. Cassell's performances in those matches suggested potential, with 7 wickets (at an average of 22.71) in the Pura Cup and 4 wickets in the ING Cup at 22.50. Cassell played all of his state cricket in the 2002-2003 season.
Despite the Bushrangers baring through his constant injury setbacks, 2006/07 proved a bad season for Cassell. When frontline bowlers Shane Harwood, Allan Wise and Gerard Denton all found themselves injured throughout the season, but Cassell remained injured himself, it left the opportunity to Clinton McKay, Darren Pattinson and Grant Lindsay to make the step up to the state side. McKay and Pattison were both offered contracts in the place of Cassell and Brad Knowles.
Cassell plays Premier Cricket for the Melbourne Cricket Club, and will play this year for them in the hopes of breaking back into the Victorian side.

Michael Eugene Kelly

Michael Eugene Kelly (born October 6, 1949, died December 22, 2013) was the owner of Yucatan Resorts, Resort Holdings International, Puerto Cancun and Avanti Motor Corporation. With 23 others, he is accused by the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office of operating a $428 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded over a thousand elderly and senior citizens of their retirement money.
Kelly was arrested in his hospital room at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, on December 22, 2006 just before he was about to be discharged to return to one of his homes in Cancún, Mexico. In pretrial services, Kelly claimed that he earned $55,000 a year and had only $48,000 in assets. In spite of this claim, Kelly offered a private jet, four yachts and race track as collateral at his detention hearing. He was denied bail and remanded to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. Kelly attempted to avoid indictment by arranging a plea agreement that included paying restitution to the victims. On 14 May 2008, Kelly plead not guilty to 14 counts of fraud and was remanded in custody. On 14 April 2009, a court permanently enjoined him from violating sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of June 30, 2012, he continues to serve out a prison sentence as the court carries out a lengthy process of liquidating former national and international assets to eventually provide partial restitution to victims of the Ponzi scheme.
In December 2012, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison.

Wallarah 2 Coal Project

The Wallarah 2 Coal Project (or W2CP) is a proposal by the Korea Resources Corporation or KORES (owned by the South Korean government and other Korean and Japanese mining companies that comprise the "Wyong Areas Coal Joint Venture") to construct a longwall mine near Wyong, New South Wales, Australia. The mine is now being considered by the NSW Department of Planning. It was previously rejected by the Keneally Government shortly before the 2011 State election.
Proposal.
The exploration areas within which the mining proposal is situated were awarded to the "Wyong Areas Coal Joint Venture" by the NSW State Government in 1995 following a competitive tender. Extensive exploration drilling, geological surveys, environmental investigations, stakeholder consultations and other works costing approximately $80 million were undertaken by the proponents. The proposed mine would have an annual coal production of 4 to 5 million tonnes of export quality thermal coal per year, over 42 years.
The associated coal loader, coal stockpile and rail link would be at least 3 kilometres away from one of the largest urban growth areas on the Central Coast, including the proposed Warnervale town centre.
Opposition and rejection of previous proposal.
The proposal was delayed by numerous studies, including an independent review headed by former NSW Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski, and widespread opposition on the Central Coast with opponents suggesting the project could impact voting at subsequent elections.
The Australian Coal Alliance was formed to oppose the project and has maintained an active public relations campaign against the proposal. It blamed the NSW Labor Party and its supporters to failing to stop the mine.
Former state Labor MP for Wyong David Harris said he was opposed to the mine, adding he was ""concerned about the noise and dust impacts on the community and for the future of the Wyong Employment Zone at Warnervale"". However, members of the Australian Coal Alliance criticised him for accepting a position as Parliamentary Secretary claiming the position suggested loyalty to the NSW Government, rather than to their campaign.
Before the 2011 State election, the NSW Opposition promised to stop the mine proposal. On the final day of the Keneally Government (the day before the issue of the writs), Minister Tony Kelly announced that the Government had made a decision that the proposal would not go ahead. David Harris attempted to "claim victory" for the proposal rejection but was defeated at the State election.

<doc id="9908459" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9908459" title="Michelagnolo Galilei">
Michelagnolo Galilei

Michelagnolo Galilei (sometimes spelled Michelangelo; 18 December 1575 – 3 January 1631) was an Italian composer and lutenist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, active mainly in Bavaria and Poland. He was the son of music theorist and lutenist Vincenzo Galilei, and the younger brother of the renowned astronomer Galileo Galilei.
Life.
Galilei was born in Florence. He learned to play the lute at an early age, like his father. Most likely he was destined for a career in Florence, but when his father died in 1591, the sixteen-year-old lutenist was put in the charge of his older brother Galileo Galilei, who was in Padua.
Some other employment had to be found for Michelagnolo, so in 1593 he went to Poland, where foreign musicians were much in demand. Most likely he went there with the powerful Lithuanian-Polish Radziwiłł family. Poland had several sophisticated musical establishments at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries, especially at Kraków: Luca Marenzio, one of Italy's most famous madrigal composers, went to Poland for a time, as did lutenists Diomedes Cato and Valentin Bakfark. Lutenists were particularly in demand, and a considerable quantity of lute music was printed in Poland, in cities such as Kraków, Gdańsk, Toruń and Vilnius.
Michelagnolo came back from Poland in 1599, in a second failed attempt to gain employment in Florence in the court of Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, but returned in 1600 to his previous Polish employer. He stayed there until 1607, at which time he was hired by the Munich Hofkapelle of Duke Maximilian I.
Munich had had one of the most progressive musical establishments in the region since the mid-16th century, having employed Orlande de Lassus; Galilei was another of many talented Italian musicians who went there to live and work. He remained in Munich for the rest of his life, fathering eight children, at least three of whom also became lutenists.
His relationship with his brother Galileo became especially difficult in his last years. Many of the letters between the two have been preserved; Michelagnolo ceaselessly implored his elder brother for money, and for help with his difficult children (Vincenzo, born in 1608, was particularly troublesome).
Music.
Most of Galilei's music was for ten-course lute, and most was published in his first book, "Il primo libro d'intavolatura di liuto" (Munich, 1620), which used tablature notation. Some of his pieces appeared singly in other publications.
His music consists of dances such as galliards, voltas and correntes, grouped loosely into suites, organized by musical mode. Each suite is preceded by a toccata, and the book closes with two paired passamezzos and saltarellos. Stylistically they are written in the most modern manner of the time, with dissonances, ornaments, and functional tonal progressions indicative of the developing early Baroque style. His musical style was particularly influential in southern Germany, as shown by the demand for his music, even when he was still in Poland.

1921 NSWRFL season

The 1921 New South Wales Rugby League premiership was the fourteenth season of Australia's first rugby league football club competition which was based in Sydney. Nine teams from across the city contested the season, with North Sydney being crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the League. The 1921 season also saw the St George club enter the competition, replacing the Annandale club, who after thirteen seasons, exited the League.
Season summary.
Because of the departing 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain in mid-July only one round of 9 rounds was played, with the second round being devoted to the City Cup. The premiership was decided with no finals on a first-past-the-post basis. 
Premiers North Sydney became the second team to go through a season undefeated - seven wins and an 8-8 draw with Easts in round 5. Their brilliant performance earned them their maiden premiership.
University became the second side to have gone through a season winless, as Annandale had done the previous year. University's season yielded 8 losses from 8 starts, conceding 295 points at an average of 36.88 per match.
Teams.
With the addition of St George in place of the recently departed Annandale club, the number of teams in the League remained at nine.

Core (graph theory)

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a core is a notion that describes behavior of a graph with respect to graph homomorphisms.
Definition.
Graph formula_1 is a core if every homomorphism formula_2 is an isomorphism, that is it is a bijection of vertices of formula_1.
A core of a graph formula_4 is a graph formula_1 such that
Two graphs are said to be homomorphism equivalent or hom-equivalent if they have isomorphic cores.
Properties.
Every graph has a core, which is determined uniquely, up to isomorphism. The core of a graph "G" is always an induced subgraph of "G". If formula_11 and formula_12 then the graphs formula_1 and formula_4 are necessarily hom-equivalent.

Gambling for resurrection

Gambling for resurrection is a situation in international relations when a leader weakened domestically is willing to risk war or prolong war to maintain office. 
Theory.
Leaders who are weakened domestically often undertake risky policies to avoid undesirable developments for them personally. The fear of removal from office due to poor performance or bad luck may prompt a leader to instigate a diversionary war he or she might not rationally have started, in the hope that should it go well he or she would stay in power, or at least receiving a surge in personal popularity and patriotism to sustain them in power. Gambling for resurrection can also consist of a leader prolonging an existing war that should rationally be ended, fearing removal from office or punishment (imprisonment, exile, or death)
. The leader thus continues the war against the country's interest, adopting risky military strategies in the hope of a dramatic reversal of fortune in the war's outcome. In this situation, escalation is more attractive than peace because the losses are below the removal threshold for the leader's constituency. Once the constituency seem determined to remove the leader from office, it has no other sanction to apply to the leader. The executive, then, has nothing to risk in further escalation, but may win his right to stay in office should the gamble be successful.
Examples.
It is seldom possible to provide conclusive proof that a leader's decision to go to war or prolong war is motivated by personal or domestic political issues. However, some conflicts may be seen as Gambles for Resurrection, including:
Pop culture influence.
Gambling for resurrection is often referred to in the mainstream media as "Wag the dog," a reference to a 1997 film by the same name in which a fictional President of the United States starts a fake diversionary war to distract the American public from a sex scandal.

<doc id="9908534" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9908534" title="Ishibutai Kofun">
Ishibutai Kofun

Name.
The name of the kofun in Japanese is a combination of two words, the first, , meaning "stone", and the second, , meaning "stage". The name of the kofun therefore originates in its resemblance to a large stone stage. The Ishibutai Kofun has been known by this name at least as early as the Tokugawa period, as evidenced by its entry in the "Saigoku sanjūsansho meisho zue", a large guide to Buddhist pilgrimage sites written by Kanenari Akatsuki in 1853.
Association with Soga no Umako.
The Ishibutai Kofun is inferred to be the tomb of Soga no Umako (551? - 626), and his death during the reign of Empress Suiko is recorded in the "Nihon shoki".
The historian and archeologist Sadakichi Kita (1871 - 1939) proposed that the Ishibutai Kofun is the above mentioned "Momohana" tomb in the '"Nihon shoki". Kita also proposed that the earthen mound of the Ishibutai Kofun was removed after Soga no Umako's death as a punishment of the Soga clan by the imperial government.
Structure.
The Ishibutai Kofun was built on a spur of a mountain that falls northeast to a small plateau. It consists of a platform, a gallery entryway, stone walls that form a tomb, two large stones that form a ceiling for the tomb, and embankments on either side of the tomb. In total 30 stones were used to construct the Ishibutai Kofun. The large granite megaliths come from Mount Tōnomine, which is approximately from the site.
Platform and moat.
The Ishibutai Kofun originally occupied a much larger area than is evidenced by the existing stone tumulus. It was built on a square platform, which measured on each side at the time of construction. Archeological excavations have revealed that the kofun was surrounded by a moat, a feature typical of other kofun of the period. This moat is estimated to be wide. In total the kofun, platform, and moat probably covered an area long.
Approach.
Kofun typically had a stone approach to the entrance path of the tomb. The Ishibutai has a particularly long entrance path, which measures . A shallow drainage channel long and wide runs the length of the entrance path. This entrance was originally covered like the tomb, but its stone ceiling no longer exists.
Tomb.
The Ishibutai Kofun is a corridor-type tomb. The inner chamber is long, wide, and high. It consists of 30 stones, by and . Small drainage channels run along the east, north, and west of the tomb. These were constructed to drain water collects on the north side of the tomb to feed south into the shallow drainage channel in the kofun entry.
Ceiling.
The Ishibutai Kofun is especially noted for the megaliths that form the ceiling of the tomb. The ceiling of the tomb is formed by two megaliths, one to the north and one to the south. The megalith at the north of the tomb weighs approximately , and the larger stone to the south weighs approximately .
Mound.
The Ishibutai Kofun was originally a large, flat type kofun; the existing stone structure was covered at the time of construction by a broad, flat earthen mound. This mound eroded slowly after the construction of the kofun, thus exposing the large megaliths of the tomb roof.
Excavation.
The Ishibutai Kofun was first excavated by the archaeologist and academic Kōsaku Hamada (1881－1938). Imperial kofun have not been readily excavated in Japan. Due to its association with Soga no Umako, the Ishibutai tumulus does not have an imperial designation, and has thus seen extensive excavation. The kofun was first excavated in 1933, work on the base and moat began in 1935, and excavation of the tomb continued until 1975.
The Ishibutai Kofun excavation yielded no significant finds. Funerary objects were probably lost to grave robbery quite soon after its construction. Stone shards to the southeast of the tomb are the remains of a tuff sarcophagus. Numerous examples of gilt and bronze implements, as well as earthenware shards were found in the banks of the tomb approach. The excavation also revealed that other similar flat stone kofun were built to the north and south of the existing structure. 
The Ishibutai Kofun was designated a historical remain in 1935. In 1954 the kofun was fully designated as a , one of only 75 sites in Japan with this designation. As excavation of the Ishibutai Kofun continued after World War II, significant reconstruction of areas around the kofun were carried out. The kofun and its surrounding area is part of the Asuka Historical National Government Park.
Transportation.
The Ishibutai Kofun is accessible from Asuka Station, which is served by the Kintetsu Yoshino Line. The "Kame Bus" (Tortoise Bus), also called the Asuka Tour Bus/Asuka Circle Route Bus, serves all locations within the Asuka Historical National Government Park, and leaves hourly from Asuka Station. Bicycle rentals are also available at numerous points around the station, and cost approximately 1000 yen a day.

Aza Raskin

Aza Raskin (born February 1, 1984) is an American interface designer. He is the son of human-computer interface expert Jef Raskin.
Raskin has been noted for continuing his father's work in project Archy, for working as head of user experience at Mozilla Labs and lead designer for Firefox, and for his participation in various start-up companies.
Personal projects.
Raskin gave his first talk on user interfaces at age 10 at the local San Francisco chapter of SIGCHI. He holds bachelor degrees in mathematics and physics from the University of Chicago.
In 2004, Aza Raskin worked with Jef Raskin at the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces on Archy, a new user interface paradigm. The next year, he founded Humanized Inc. to continue work on the Archy paradigm. At Humanized, he created the language-based service-oriented Enso software.
During the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, Raskin mobilized with a group of other entrepreneurs (including Joshua Rosen, the art director of Steven Spielberg's movie A.I.) to create a crowd-source Web site to turn real-time information streams into meaningful map data, used by several major non-governmental organizations helping on the group in Haiti hosted at Haiti.com.
Raskin is also an active phishing researcher, best known for discovering the tabnabbing attack; the technique takes advantage of open browser tabs to launch phishing sites without the user's knowledge.
He also has a number of smaller projects like Algorithm Ink (based on Context Free) which generates art from a formal grammar.
Raskin wrote an article for the "Rebooting Britain" series at the Wired UK magazine, and has given a TED talk.
Work at Mozilla Corporation.
In 2008, Raskin and the other Humanized employees were part of a hire-out by the Mozilla Corporation. In 2010, Raskin was appointed Creative Lead for Firefox, having previously been head of user experience at Mozilla Labs. He has worked on several labs projects including Ubiquity, Firefox for mobile, and wrote the original specification for the Geolocation API.
In 2010, Raskin introduced the results of his work on the Firefox team at Mozilla: Tab Candy. Organizing tabs spatially, Tab Candy allowed the user to "organize browsing, to see all of our tabs at once, and focus on the task at hand."
Tab Candy's initial design and alpha release has been called "the best new browser feature since tabs were invented" by Computerworld. Tab Candy was later renamed Firefox Panorama and hidden by default in the initial Firefox 4 release. In an upcoming release, Panorama will be moved to an add-on and removed from Firefox.
Start-ups.
Raskin has founded two other companies besides Humanized, including Songza, a music meta-search tool, and Bloxes, which sells furniture made out of cardboard. Songza was acquired in late 2008 by Amazon-backed Amie Street.
By the end of 2010 Raskin announced he had left Mozilla to begin a health-related venture at "Massive Health" start-up, with the goal to apply design principles to the problem of being healthy. On April 16, 2012, Massive Health announced that Raskin would lead the company as Chief Vision Officer.

Although short of stature (five feet and seven and a half inches tall), he developed a muscular physique while coal mining for almost five years. With the Great Depression, the coal mines closed in 1930. It was about this time that he was invited to play for a team in McCook, Nebraska. Kreevich soon went from that small town team to the National League's Chicago Cubs, thanks to a scout who recognized the talent in him.

HMS Campania (D48)

HMS "Campania" was an escort aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that saw service during the Second World War. After the war, the ship was used as a floating exhibition hall for the 1951 Festival of Britain and as the command ship for the 1952 Operation Hurricane, the test of the prototype British atomic bomb.
She was built at Harland & Wolff shipyards in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When construction started in 1941 she was intended as a refrigerated cargo ship for transporting lamb and mutton from New Zealand, but was requisitioned by the British Government during construction and completed and launched as an escort carrier, entering service in early 1944.
The ship was of a similar, but not identical design to the other ships of the .
Second World War.
"Campania" operated escorting convoys and doing anti-submarine work in the Atlantic and Arctic theatres. In December 1944, her Swordfish aircraft from a detachment of 813 Squadron sank the German submarine U-365 while the "Campania" was escorting the Arctic convoy Convoy RA-62.
The ship survived the war, and unlike other Royal Navy escort carriers, was not immediately scrapped or sold. She was briefly used as an aircraft transport before being decommissioned and placed in reserve in December 1945.
Festival of Britain.
The Festival Office's resident designer, James Holland, considered that the vessel would "not convert easily into a showboat", but with the massive demand for shipping to help rebuild Europe after the war, he and his colleagues felt lucky to have any ship at all.
Repainted white, the ship was decorated with skeleton masts and bunting. Officially named the Sea Travelling Exhibition, the exhibits were intended to reflect the main London Exhibition. Like the Festival's Land Travelling Exhibition, they were divided into three sections, the "Land of Britain", "Discovery" and "The People at Home". Between 4 May 1951 and 6 October, the ship visited Southampton, Dundee, Newcastle, Hull, Plymouth, Bristol, Cardiff, Belfast, Birkenhead and Glasgow, staying at each port for 10–14 days.
Operation Hurricane.
With the festival over, the ship was refitted in Birkenhead for a very different role, as the command ship for Operation Hurricane, the test of the first British atomic bomb on the Monte Bello Islands off western Australia. The refit saw the exhibition replaced by workshops, laboratories, offices and cabins, plus a desalination plant since the Monte Bello Islands did not have any indigenous fresh water source to supply the 1500 personnel who would take part in the test.
Four other ships were directly involved in the test, the landing ships "Narvik", "Zeebrugge", "Tracker" and the frigate, "Plym". "Tracker" was designated as the health ship and extensively equipped with decontamination facilities, whilst the weapon was to be detonated aboard "Plym". The flotilla was under the overall command of Rear Admiral Arthur David Torlesse.
Heavily laden with crated equipment and deck cargo, including three Westland Dragonfly helicopters and two Sea Otter aircraft and deck cargo, the re-commissioned "Campania" departed from Portsmouth for the islands on 2 June 1952. Eighty-five scientists were also on board as passengers, around half directly involved in British nuclear programme and the remainder from other parts of the British civil service.
The vessel arrived at the Monte Bello Islands on 8 August after calling into Gibraltar, Cape Town, Mauritius and Fremantle and the next two months were spent preparing for the test, which took place on 3 October. "Campania" was not found to be particularly suitable as the main base for the test, partly because it was hot and cramped, and partly because there were insufficient boats for ferrying them between the ship and the shore and the eight pinnaces intended to perform about a third of the work could not moor close to the ship at night because the water was too choppy. Most of the scientists and engineers soon moved to tented accommodation ashore.
The ship was decommissioned for the final time in December 1952 following her return to the United Kingdom, and sold and scrapped in Blyth in 1955.

West Torrens Cricket Club

The West Torrens District Cricket Club ("Western Eagles") is a semi-professional cricket club in Adelaide, South Australia. It competes in the West End Grade Cricket Competition, which is administered by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA).
The Western Eagles field four senior teams and nine junior teams and are based at Henley & Grange Memorial Oval. Other grounds used by the club include Henley High School, Jubilee Oval and Lockleys North PS.
The club has won 13 A grade premierships with the last being in 2006/07, breaking a 45 year premiership drought. The Eagles have also won 4 West End Cup (One Day) Premierships (1971/72, 1972/73, 1993/94 and 2003/04). During the past decade the club has become one of the strongest in the South Australian Grade Cricket League, winning lower grade premierships in 1995/96, 2002/03, 2007/08 & 2012/13 (B Grade), 2003/04, 2004/05 & 2006/07 (C Grade) and winning the SACA Club Championship in 2004/05, 2006/07 and 2011/12. 
Season 2011/12 was another strong year for the club; the Eagle playing in Grand Finals in the A grade, West End Cup One-Day Competition, C grade, A Grade Women's and the U16 Reds winning a premiership. The club was also successful in winning the BankSA Shield (U16s) and U13 premierships. 
History.
The Club began in 1862 as the Hindmarsh Cricket Club with its headquarters at Lindsay Circus (now Hindmarsh Stadium) and has continued, with only a change of name in 1897, until the present day, making it the 2nd oldest cricket club in South Australia. Morphett Vale Cricket Club (established 1849) is the oldest cricket club in South Australia. 
The club moved to Thebarton Oval in 1921 where it remained until 1988 when it transferred to the adjacent King's Reserve. A lack of junior players and inadequate facilities saw a final move to the Henley and Grange Memorial Oval for the 1997-98 season.
Famous players.

Frothar (archbishop of Bordeaux)

Frothar or Frotar (Latin "Frotharius", French "Frotaire") was an Aquitanian prelate in West Francia, who held two different bishoprics and three abbacies during a long career. He was appointed Archbishop of Bordeaux around 859, but Viking raids forced him to abandon his seat in 870. With papal approval, he was transferred to the archdiocese of Bourges in 876. He died after 893.
Frothar was related to the Counts of Toulouse and Rouergue, and perhaps to his predecessor at Bourges, Rodulf. By maintaining control of the abbeys of Brioude and Beaulieu, he probably preserved his family's influence in southern Gaul during the ascendancy of Bernard Plantapilosa. Brioude had been under the protection of the Counts of Auvergne until 874, when Frothar possessed it. King Charles the Bald granted it permission to elect its own abbot and the monks chose Frothar, who was abbot as late as 893. After Frothar's death, the abbey reverted to the control of Duke William I of Aquitaine. Frothar was also the abbot of Saint-Hilaire-de-Poitiers from 868 and of Charroux in Provence from about the same time.
Frothar was archbishop by late 860, when Hincmar of Reims directed an epistolary treatise at him and Rodulf of Bourges. In the treatise, Hincmar suggested that the marriage of a certain Count Stephen to a daughter of Count Raymond of Toulouse could be annulled on the grounds that the couple had not consummated it. Rodulf and Frothar seem to have successfully negotiated the annulment and preserved peace between the two powerful Aquitanian families of Stephen and Raymond. This was especially important because Aquitaine had recently be constituted a subkingdom under the king's son, Charles the Younger. Hincmar later opposed Frothar's transfer to Bourges at the synod of Ponthion (20 June–16 July 876).
Frothar was active in preserving church lands. He returned lands his family stole from Beaulieu in the Limousin and forced his relatives to confirm a charter of 887 restoring those lands to Beaulieu. He also intervened with King Carloman to have land in Fréjus in Provence taken from the abbey of Saint-Victor de Marseille returned to it.

<doc id="9908826" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9908826" title="Plato's five regimes">
Plato's five regimes

The Classical Greek philosopher Plato discusses five types of regimes. They are Aristocracy, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent Tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with Aristocracy at the top and Tyranny at the bottom.
Aristocracy.
Aristocracy is the form of government (politeia) advocated in Plato's Republic. This regime is ruled by a philosopher king, and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of The Republic's books, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, that are studied primarily in Book VIII.
The aristocratic state that Plato idealizes is composed of three caste-like parts: the ruling class, made up of the aforementioned philosophers-kings (who are otherwise identified as having souls of gold); the auxiliaries of the ruling caste, made up of soldiers (whose souls are made up of silver), and whose job in the state is to force on the majority the order established by the philosophers; and the majority of the people (souls of either bronze or iron), who in contrast to the first two classes are allowed to own property and produce goods for themselves, but are also obliged to sustain with their own activities their rulers' — who are forbidden from owning property.
The aristocratic man is better represented by Plato's brand of philosopher: a man whose character and ambitions have been forged into those ideal for a just ruler through a rigorous education system designed to train intellectuals that are selfless and upright, and whose souls have been made calm and aware of the absolute Good by learning the Truth based on the Platonic Ideas. Plato envisages for this philosopher a disposition and ability that makes him the ideal governor of any state precisely because his soul knows the Truth of the Good and he is therefore not only dedicated to establishing the Good in the state but is also incapable of desiring anything but the Good, for both the state and himself. Thus this man is not tempted to abuse power for his own gain; and, through his knowledge of the true virtues, is able to establish the ideal conditions for the citizens of his state to live the Good life.
In contrast to historical aristocracies, Plato's resembles a meritocracy or proto-technocracy of sorts. In it, a big government state keeps track of the innate character and natural skills of the citizens' children, and then directs them to the education that best suits those traits. In this manner, a child with a gold soul born to parents with silver, bronze or iron souls will be educated to levels above his kin according to his golden qualities, and, conversely, from parents with gold and silver souls, a child born with a bronze or an iron soul is educated to only the level earned by his natural aptitudes.
Timocracy.
Aristocracy degenerates into timocracy when, due to miscalculation on the part of its governed class, the next generation of guardians and auxiliaries includes persons of an inferior nature (the persons with souls made of iron or bronze, as opposed to the ideal guardians and auxiliaries, who have souls made of gold and silver).
A timocracy, in choosing its leaders, is "inclining rather to the more high-spirited and simple-minded type, who are better suited for war". The governants of timocracy value power, but they seek to attain it primarily by means of military conquest and the acquisition of honors, instead of intellectual means. Of the man who represents a timocratic state, Socrates says that his nature is primarily good: He may see in his father (who himself would correspond to an aristocractic state) a man who doesn't bother his soul with power displays and civil disputes, but instead occupies himself only with cultivating his own virtues. However, that same young man may find in other persons in his house, his mother for example, a resentment of the father's indifference to status. The future timocrat thus becomes divided in the following manner: by observing his father and listening to his reasoning, he's tempted to the flourishing of his own intellect and virtues; but influenced by his mother or other persons in his house, or city, he may become power craving. He thus assents to the intermediate portion of his soul (see Plato's tripartite theory of soul), the one that is aggressive and courageous (thus the timocracy's military character).
The young timocrat may be himself somewhat contemptuous towards money and money-making activity, but he becomes increasingly focused in saving his goods as he ages, since the virtues of his soul have not been purified by the salutary effects of reasoning activities and aesthetic experiences. The timocrat is further described as obedient towards authority, respectful to other free citizens, good at listening, and aggressive rather than contemptuous towards slaves.
Oligarchy.
Plato defines oligarchy as a system of government which distinguishes between the rich and the poor, making of the former its administrators.
An oligarchy is originated by extending tendencies already evident in a timocracy. In contrast to platonic aristocrats, timocrats are allowed by their constitution to own property and thus to both accumulate and waste money. Because of the pleasures derived from it, money is valued over virtue, and the leaders of the state seek to alter the law to give way and accommodate to the materialistic lust of its citizens. As a result of this new found appreciation for money, the governors rework the constitution to restrict political power to the rich only. That is how a timocracy becomes an oligarchy.
Plato gives a detailed account of the problems usually faced by the oligarchies of his days, which he considered as significantly more troubled than the former system, that of timocracy. The following are examples of such problems:
As to the man whose character reflects that of an oligarchy, Plato says that he might have been the child of a timocratic man: The son initially emulates the father, and is ambitious and craves for fame and honor. When, however, he witnesses the problems his father faces due to those timocratic tendencies — say, he wastes public goods in a military campaign, and then is brought before the court, losing his properties after trial —, the future oligarch becomes poor. He then rejects the ambitions he had in his soul, which he now sees as harmful, and puts in their place craving for money, instead of honor, and a parsimonious cautiousness. Such men, the oligarchs, live only to enrich themselves, and through their private means they seek to fulfill only their most urgent needs. However when in charge of public goods they become quite 'generous'.
Oligarchs do, however, value at least one virtue, that of temperance and moderation — not out of an ethical principle or spiritual concern, but because by dominating wasteful tendencies they succeed in accumulating money. Thus even though he has bad desires — which Plato compares to the anarchic tendencies of the poor people in oligarchies -, by virtue of temperance the oligarch managed to establish a fragile order in his soul. Thus the oligarch may seem, at least in appearance, superior to the majority.
Democracy.
Oligarchy then degenerates into democracy where freedom is the supreme good but freedom is also slavery. In democracy, the lower class grows bigger and bigger. The poor become the winners. Diversity is supreme. People are free to do what they want and live how they want. People can even break the law if they so chose. This appears to be very similar to anarchy.
Plato uses the "democratic man" to represent democracy. The democratic man is the son of the oligarchic man. Unlike his father, the democratic man is consumed with unnecessary desires. Plato describes necessary desires as desires that we have out of instinct or desires that we have in order to survive. Unnecessary desires are desires we can teach ourselves to resist such as the desire for riches. The democratic man takes great interest in all the things he can buy with his money. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants to do it. His life has no order or priority.
Tyranny.
Democracy then degenerates into tyranny where no one has discipline and society exists in chaos. Democracy is taken over by the longing for freedom. Power must be seized to maintain order. A champion will come along and experience power, which will cause him to become a tyrant. The people will start to hate him and eventually try to remove him but will realize they are not able.
The tyrannical man is the son of the democratic man. He is the worst form of man. He is consumed by lawless desires which cause him to do many terrible things such as murdering someone unjustly. He comes closest to complete lawlessness. The idea of moderation does not exist to him. He is consumed by the pleasures in life. He spends all of his money and becomes poor and leads a miserable life.
When Plato says the tyrant is a prisoner to the lawless master he means that if the tyrant should lose his power for any reason his life and the life of his family would be in great danger. The tyrant always runs the risk of being killed in revenge for all the unjust things he has done. He becomes afraid to leave his own home and becomes trapped inside. Therefore his lawless behavior leads to his own self-imprisonment.

Climate of Beaumont, Texas

The Climate of Beaumont, Texas covers the averages and extremes in past weather seen within the city of Beaumont, Texas, and is within the humid subtropical climate regime. This city is within the Piney Woods, which cover the eastern region of Texas. This region of Texas receives the most rainfall; more than annually. This is due to the warm gulf waters that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates. Hurricanes also strike the region, the most disastrous of which was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike were the largest and most damaging hurricanes to hit Beaumont, causing $11.3 billion and $31.5 billion, respectively, in total damage to the U.S. The humidity of the region greatly amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer. The winters are kept moderate by warm gulf currents. Wintry precipitation is unusual, but does occur. The most recent snow events were December 11, 2008,and December 4, 2009, these snowfalls were first notable accumulation since December 24, 2004.And even more recently the Beaumont area had a trace of snow on February 24, 2010 that only lasted for only 30 minutes and quickly melted on contact with the ground. The area suffered a severe ice storm in 1997. And in unofficial records, Beaumont received as much as 30 inches of snow on February 14 and 15 during the blizzard of 1895 that impacted the gulf coast with unusual cold weather. The temperature reported a drop to a low of 4°F after the storm although it is unofficial.
Temperature.
The humidity of the region greatly amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer. The winters are kept moderate by warm gulf currents.
Precipitation.
This region of Texas receives the most rainfall; more than annually in the far east. This is due to the warm gulf waters that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates.
Wintry precipitation.
The most recent snow event was December 4, 2009, the first such occurrence since 2008. The area suffered a severe ice storm in January 1997.
Severe weather.
Hurricanes.
In 1957, Hurricane Audrey, a strong category 4 hurricane (borderline category 5 at times), came onshore straight up the Texas/Louisiana border, causing massive flooding and wind damage. At least 416 people lost their lives (other estimates show over 500), mostly in Louisiana due to drowning from its storm surge. 
In 1961, Hurricane Carla, the largest storm in terms of size, affected the entire Texas coastline from Jefferson County to Brownsville. Carla caused $2.6 billion (2006 dollars) in damage. Beaumont suffered tornadoes and massive flooding due to poor drainage.
Beaumont went without another hurricane impact until June 26, 1986, when Hurricane Bonnie roared through the region with maximum winds at , with gusts to , which created havoc on local roadways because of the massive amounts of rain dumped on the area. Some locations near the city received to , flooding homes and businesses. Many mobile home parks were destroyed, people were displaced, and some area businesses never recovered. Three people lost their lives in Bonnie.
Beaumonters dealt with Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Beaumont and the vicinity did not experience the damage and destruction that Houston got, as only to of rain fell near Beaumont. Homes are still abandoned due to massive flooding that took place.
Hurricane Rita hit the city on September 24, 2005, leveling many buildings and leaving remaining residents without power. Virtually every building in the town was damaged, some even destroyed. Thousands of tall pine trees were toppled and hundreds of Beaumont's grand old oak trees were uprooted. Hurricane Rita clipped southeast Louisiana before moving into Southeast Texas as a strong Category 3 storm. Many residents of Jefferson County evacuated to northern counties only to find themselves swarmed by dozens of tornadoes that had been spawned by the storm. It was two weeks before residents were allowed to reenter the city. A curfew from dusk to dawn was imposed for a little more than one month. 
The most recent hurricane to hit Beaumont was Hurricane Ike on the morning of September 13, 2008. Having caused $31.5 billion worth damage on its path of deadly destruction, Hurricane Ike was the third most destructive hurricane to ever make landfall in the United States.
Floods.
On May 29, 2006, a more typical rain event in Beaumont and surrounding areas received 10 to of rain during the morning hours. Numerous homes were flooded, but no major flooding occurred. Several vehicles also became trapped in high water on some low-lying roads and highway underpasses.

Develop Turkey

Develop Turkey [http://www.developturkey.org] (DT) is a development monitoring organization. Started in 2006, DT aims to build an international community of social investors, and bridge them with Turkish non-governmental organizations NGOs with the ultimate goal of promoting social development in Turkey. DT recognizes the ills associated with the fledgling transparent social sector in Turkey. Aside from the lack of certain institutions and attitudes, bureaucratic lag and political corruption deters many donors from trusting the reliability and effectiveness of the Turkish social sector. Moreover, majority of the 150000 active NGOs in Turkey suffer from the scarcity of financial capacity and efficient communication networks. Discontinuities in the flow of information between donors and recipient organizations, as well as the underdeveloped research capabilities of the organizations themselves impede the process of efficient social development. In light of the status quo, DT’s qualified team has two goals: matching donor individuals and corporations abroad with relevant NGOs functioning in Turkey, and contributing to human development in Turkey in the long run. Towards the realization of this ideal, DT forms a membership from a vast array of Turkish non-profits, opens chapters in other Ivy League universities in the US, and directs Turkey related individuals and corporations to the NGOs upon their need-based applications.

Malay alphabet

The modern Malay alphabet (in Malaysia, "Tulisan Rumi", literally "Rumi script" or "Rumi writing") consists of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet without any diacritics. It is the more common of the two alphabets used today to write the Malay language, the other being Jawi (a modified Arabic script). The Latin Malay alphabet is the official Malay script in Indonesia (as Indonesian), Malaysia (as Malaysian) and Singapore, while it is co-official with Jawi in Brunei.
Historically, various scripts such as Pallava, Kawi and Rencong scripts, were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi with the introduction of Islam. The arrival of European colonial powers brought the Latin alphabet to the Malay Archipelago.
As the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the Dutch and the British), two major different spelling orthographies were developed in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. The Soewandi Spelling System (or the Republic Spelling System after independence), used in the Dutch East Indies and later in independent Indonesia until 1972, was based on the Dutch alphabet. In 1972, as part of the effort of harmonizing spelling differences between the two countries, Indonesia and Malaysia each adopted a spelling reform plan, called the Perfected Spelling System ("Ejaan yang Disempurnakan") in Indonesia and the Consolidated Latin Spelling System ("Ejaan Rumi Bersama") in Malaysia. Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malaysian varieties, a number of minor spelling differences remain.
Letter names and pronunciations.
The names of the letters differ between Indonesia and rest of the Malay-speaking countries. Indonesia follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet, while Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore follow the English alphabet. Regardless of the letter names, however, the letters represent the same sounds in all Malay-speaking countries. The Malay alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.
In addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:

World Dairy Expo

World Dairy Expo is a five-day event showcasing dairy cattle and the newest technologies available to the dairy industry. The show is held annually at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. Considered the largest and most important dairy cattle show in North America, it has been held in the first week of October since 1967.
Themes.
One of the unusual aspects about the World Dairy Expo is its themes. Since the late 1980s the show has had a theme, when the showing is decorated with two backdrops that correspond to that year's theme. Themes have ranged from the simple to the extravagant, like the "Excitement is Building" theme which had a huge construction-like backdrop.
World Dairy Expo is known for having colored shavings in the showring. The shavings have been dyed many colors. This year's theme is "Designer Dairy".
Cattle Show.
Dairy cattle from all over the United States and Canada are exhibited at the show. All seven nationally recognized breeds (Brown Swiss, Holstein, Red & White, Guernsey, Jersey, Milking Shorthorn, and Ayrshire) have a show. After a grand champion from each breed is selected, a final judging is held to determine the best two cows in the show. This is held on the last day (Saturday) and is often referred to as the main event. The show starts out with an introduction of each cow and leadsman (person at the end of the halter) listing both of their achievements. After this is done the cows are judged by all of the breed judges from the past week. After they decide on a cow, the Supreme Champion and Reserve Supreme Champion is announced.
Trade Show.
World Dairy Expo is also home to the a largest dairy-focused trade show in the world. Over 850 companies from all over the world exhibit to the show's 65,000 attendees. Companies like John Deere, Case IH, Land O'Lakes, Select Sires, Semex, ABS, ANIMART and many more make the trip to Madison, Wisconsin, USA every year. World Dairy Expo is recognized as a member of the "Tradeshow Week Top 200", a list honoring the nation's top trade events organized by Trade Show Executive Gold 100. World Dairy Expo remains the only Wisconsin event in the “Top 200”, and was ranked #22 in 2012.
Youth Contests.
World Dairy Expo offers conferences for the youth in the dairy industry. There are several regional and national judging contests in which teams and individuals from high school FFA chapters and 4-H programs can compete in as well as a division for Collegiate level teams. Contestants compete for honors in dairy judging, dairy foods and dairy forage. There is a separate junior cattle show for contestants who are college age or younger. This cattle show is separate from the main show and Supreme and Reserve Supreme champions are named the same way as the older contestants. Winning the junior show is almost as prestigious as winning the open show.

Letters to a Young Poet

Letters to a Young Poet (original title, in German: Briefe an einen jungen Dichter) is a collection of ten letters written by Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926) to Franz Xaver Kappus (1883–1966), a 19-year old officer cadet at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. Rilke, the son of an Austrian army officer, had studied at the academy's lower school at Sankt Pölten in the 1890s. Kappus corresponded with the popular poet and author from 1902 to 1908 seeking his advice as to the quality of his poetry, and in deciding between a literary career or a career as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Kappus compiled and published the letters in 1929—three years after Rilke's death from leukemia.
In the first letter, Rilke respectfully declines to review or criticize Kappus' poetry, advising the younger Kappus that "Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself." Rilke, over the course of the ten letters proceeds to advise Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process. Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of "Das Stunden-Buch" ("The Book of Hours") and "Das Buch der Bilder" ("The Book of Images").
Writing and publication.
Correspondence with Rilke.
In 1929, Franz Xaver Kappus compiled ten letters that he received from Rainer Maria Rilke that were written from 1902 to 1908 and published them under the title "Briefe an einen jungen Dichter" ("Letters to a Young Poet") through Insel Verlag in Leipzig. Rilke and Kappus never met in person.
In an introduction to the collection, Kappus recounts how he came to write to Rainer Maria Rilke. According to Kappus, in late 1902 while a student at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria, he was reading Rilke's poetry. He was approached by the academy's chaplain, Horacek, who noted that Rilke had been a pupil years earlier at the academy's lower school at Sankt Pölten. Horacek expressed surprise that the former pupil had "become a poet" and described to Kappus the young Rilke as a "thin, pale boy" whose quiet demeanor proved unable to bear the strain of a military education and life. Rilke did not continue his military education. At the time that Kappus learned this he was inclined toward writing and was not very keen on the notion of dedicating his life to the military. Kappus then decided to write to Rilke for advice. 
When Kappus wrote his first letter to Rilke he asked for Rilke to provide a critique his poetry. Rilke provided the young Kappus very little in criticism or in suggestions for his improvement as a poet. Instead, Rilke discouraged Kappus from reading criticism and advised him to trust his inner judgment, commenting that "Nobody can advise you and help you. Nobody. There is only one way—Go into yourself." Rilke provided advice that inspired Kappus to search broader issues of intimacy and the nature of beauty and art, as well as probing philosophical and existential questions. The letters address personal issues that Kappus had apparently revealed to Rilke; ranging from atheism, loneliness, sexuality, and career choices.
In the collection, Kappus omitted to include his letters to Rilke and only included one sonnet of his own that Rilke sent back to him in Rilke's own handwriting with the instruction to "Read the lines as if they were unknown to you, and you will feel in your inmost self how very much they are yours."
Rilke's influence on Kappus.
Aside from his role in writing to Rilke and later publishing these letters, Franz Xaver Kappus (1883–1966) is largely forgotten by history. Kappus was descended from a Banat Swabian (ethnic German) family born in Timișoara, in the Banat region, now divided between Hungary, Serbia and Romania. Despite the hesitancy he expressed in his letters to Rilke about pursuing a military career, he continued his military studies and served for 15 years as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the course of his life, he worked as an newspaper editor and journalist, writing poems, humorous sketches, short-stories, novels, and adapted several works (including his own) into screenplays for films in the 1930s. However, Kappus did not achieve lasting fame.
The Letters.
The first letter.
Written in Paris, France on 17 February 1903 - Theme of letter: Criticism fails to "touch a work of art." Rilke urges his reader to eschew others' opinions of his poetry. Instead, the young poet should look inward and examine what truly motivates him to continue writing. Rilke expands on the theme of developing a rich inner life and offers an inspiring perspective on the process of creating art.

PL Kyodan

, is a Japanese Shinshūkyō (new religious movement) founded in 1924 by Tokuharu Miki (1871-1938), who was a priest in the Ōbaku sect of Zen Buddhism. The stated aim of the Church of Perfect Liberty is to bring about world peace.
Teachings.
PL teaches that "Life is Art" and that humans are born to express their own unique individuality in everything they do — "creating true art". To assist them in improving their lives and overcoming hardships, church members are taught why they have these problems and are guided in solving them by the Patriarch (known as "oshieoya-sama" 'teacher-parent') and church ministers.
Precepts.
PL does not have a holy book, it has 21 PL Precepts which were announced by Tokuchika Miki on September 29, 1947. These became the basic teachings of the Church.
The 21 PL precepts are:
Membership.
The church claims to have more than one million followers worldwide and 500 churches located in ten countries. 
Most of the parishes are located in Japan, but due to the active missionary work in the 1960s PL was established in South America and the United States as well. In the 21st century it also has a presence in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Peru. The Oceanian headquarters was founded in the 1990s in Brisbane, Australia. Small communities exist in Europe as well, especially in France, Portugal and Hungary.
1970 saw the construction of the "PL Peace Tower", a monument to all the people who have died in war, from the beginning of time.
Organization.
PL's spiritual leader, the Patriarch, is called "Oshieoya-sama", (English: Father of the Teachings). The third and current Patriarch of the church is Takahito Miki. Miki is also the vice president of "Shinshuren", the Federation of New Religious Organizations of Japan.
The second Patriarch Tokuchika Miki three times visited the Holy See, and met two Popes to improve inter-religious cooperation.

Masterton (New Zealand electorate)

Masterton was a New Zealand electorate from 1887 to 1946, focused on the town of Masterton and the surrounding area.
Population centres.
In the 1887 electoral redistribution, although the Representation Commission was required through the Representation Act 1887 to maintain existing electorates "as far as possible", rapid population growth in the North Island required the transfer of three seats from the South Island to the north. Ten new electorates were created, including Masterton, and one former electorate was recreated.
The Masterton electorate's boundaries were roughly based on those of the Wairarapa North electorate that it replaced, although it was not an exact match. The electorate ran from the Tararua Ranges down to the sea, with its northern boundary just north of Eketahuna and its southern boundary just south of the largest Wairarapa town of Masterton.
The 1890 elections saw the electorate gain Pahiatua and Woodville, but lose territory on the coast south of Castlepoint. At the 1893 elections, it lost Woodville, and in the 1896 elections, it lost Pahiatua. In the 1911 elections, it lost Castlepoint, leaving it almost landlocked.
History.
The electorate of Masterton was created for the 1887 general election. It was represented by five Members of Parliament.
The electorate was abolished in 1946; the town of Masterton itself was moved to the Wairarapa electorate, while the rest was moved to the Pahiatua electorate.

Chappell &amp; Co.

Chappell & Co. was an English company that published music and manufactured pianos.
History.
It was founded in 1810 by Samuel Chappell in partnership with music professors Francis Tatton Latour and Johann Baptist Cramer. Cramer was also a well-known London composer, teacher and pianist. The firm's premises included large showrooms for pianos and other musical instruments (for sale or hire) and sheet music on several floors and became a prominent landmark on Bond Street. Chappell was active in forming the Philharmonic Society. The firm's reputation grew fast, and in 1819, Beethoven wrote to a colleague regarding a piece that he wished to publish, "Potter says that Chappell in Bond Street is now one of the best publishers." Chappell died in 1834, and his oldest son William Chappell (1809–1888) took over, managing the firm on behalf of his widowed mother, Emily Chappell "née" Patey. Around 1843, William left to join Cramer & Co. and later to found the Percy Society and the Musical Antiquarian Society. His younger brother Thomas Patey Chappell (1819–1902) then took charge. Originally concentrating on music publishing and concert promotion, the firm started manufacturing pianos in the 1840s.
Thomas extended the publishing business of Chappell & Co. and focused the publishing company on musical theatre, a specialty that is still important to the success of Chappell today. The firm promoted concerts, operas and other events that might create a market for music sales. Thomas conceived of and sponsored the Monday and Saturday Popular Concerts at St James Hall (1859), which was partly owned by the family. The concerts were successfully managed by a younger brother, Samuel Arthur Chappell, until they came to an end in 1901. One of Tom Chappell's successes was the publication of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other music of Arthur Sullivan, as well as, earlier, Gounod's "Faust", Balfe's "The Bohemian Girl". He was also one of the original directors of
the Royal College of Music and one of the original governors of the Royal Albert Hall. Thomas died in 1902. Thomas was of the founding members of the Music Publishers Association and became the Association's first Chairman and held the office between 1881 and 1900. William Boosey wrote,
During the 20th century, Chappell became one of the leading music publishers and piano manufacturers in Britain. In 1964, the building was destroyed by fire but was subsequently rebuilt. By the late 1970s, the firm had become a worldwide music publishing leader famous for publishing musical theatre works, including Rodgers and Hammerstein. In 1980, Chappell sold their retail activities to concentrate solely on music publishing. Its premises on London's Bond Street were bought by Kemble Pianos, a large distributor of Yamaha pianos, who operated the music store under the name of Chappell of Bond Street. The Chappell & Co. publishing business was bought in 1987 by Warner Bros., which merged its music publishing firms to form Warner/Chappell Music.

Pent Valley Technology College (formerly Pent Valley Secondary Modern) is a secondary school situated in Cheriton, Kent, England. The college, which was formed by the merger of Harcourt Secondary School for Girls, Harcourt Primary School and Morehall Secondary School for Boys in the early 1970s, attracts pupils from Folkestone, Hawkinge and Hythe.
The school was granted Technology College status in 2003. It is a partner school of the University of Kent in Canterbury.
New Pent Valley.
In 2011 plans to demolish the school in order to regenerate the original building. Students are included in the decision of these new plans. The sports hall will not be demolished because it is a newer building.
All plans have been postponed because of a government spending review. Most buildings at Pent Valley are in a good enough condition and are not needed to be replaced.
Sport.
The school's main sporting rivals in Shepway include the Harvey Grammar School and The Folkestone Academy. A new sports hall was opened by Colin Jackson in 2005.
Pent Valley Leisure Centre.
The Valley Leisure Centre (VLC) was renamed the Pent Valley Leisure Centre (PVLC) to make it appear more connected to the school.

Saints &amp; Sinners (2007 TV series)

Saints & Sinners is a telenovela which premiered on March 14, 2007 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT on the American television network MyNetworkTV. Twentieth Television produced this limited-run serial, based on the a 2000 TV Azteca telenovela titled "La Calle de las Novias" ("Brides’ Avenue"). Two hour installments aired on Wednesday evenings through April, when the show moved to a one-hour slot on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. 
The network dropped the serial from its time after the July 18, 2007 broadcast. Most episodes were left unaired in the U.S.. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has not announced plans to release this series on DVD and/or Blu-ray.
Story.
This modern-day Romeo-and-Juliet story revolves around two Miami Beach families – the Capshaws and the Martins – who are plagued by a long, bitter rivalry. Julia Capshaw (Tyler Kain) falls is in love with Roman Martin (Scott Bailey), the man accused of killing her father. They find themselves caught between their feuding hotel-owner families, who will stop at nothing to succeed. Meanwhile, a handsome stranger who works for the DEA poses as a priest Marcus Pitt. But a darker force is at work. A powerful drug-running kingpin nicknamed "The Guerrero", has not only murdered Julia Capshaw's father Howard, but is on the loose and killing more people every day. The climax of the series features Julia and Roman finally reuniting just in time to unmask the Guerrero, who turns out to be Roman's mother, Diana Martin.
Mel Harris plays Sylvia Capshaw, Julia's mother. María Conchita Alonso and Charles Shaughnessy play Roman's parents, Diana (who was secretly "the Guerrero" and made Bo Derek's character from "Fashion House", Maria Gianni, look like a saint) and August Martin. Natalie Martinez plays their daughter, Pilar Martin. Robin Givens plays Kelly Dodd, a New York fashion designer who develops a crush on Roman. Michael Duvert and Joe Tabbanella are also in the cast.
Initially, the Capshaw and the Martin clans were named the Oliveras and the Mazzonis. In the Mexican original, they were the Sánchez and Mendoza families. Joe Tabbanella played Marco Manetti on another MyNetworkTV telenovela, "Desire", while Natalie Martinez portrayed Michelle Miller on MyNetworkTV's "Fashion House".
Development.
The limited-run serial was originally intended to run in syndication as "A Dangerous Love" under the "Secret Obsessions" umbrella title. Next, MyNetworkTV planned to air 65 one-hour episodes on weekdays with a Saturday night recap. Then the network, facing low ratings, decided to cut back on telenovelas and cancel them.
Initially, new episodes ran on Wednesday nights as a two-hour block, then were cut to one hour per week. While MyNetworkTV stopped development on future telenovelas, "Saints and Sinners" had already finished shooting before the decision was announced. This show's final broadcast marks the end of the new network's experiment with serialized dramas. 
While the show is set in Florida, it was filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego, except for a few exterior shots. The MyNetworkTV Web site lists the show as "part of the "Secret Obsessions" series." About 75 minutes of program was stretched to fill each two-hour weekly timeslot.[http://www.southflorida.com/movies/sfl-tvtjmynetmar12,0,469232.column?coll=sfe-tv-headlines
MyNetworkTV announced plans to run this show and "American Heiress" once per week until October, when the remaining episodes will appear online. MyNetworkTV President Greg Meidel previously said the network would air the complete runs of both shows. However, the network unceremoniously yanked both telenovelas after the July 18, 2007 broadcast. Only 26 out of 65 hours aired.
In America, "Saints & Sinners" most recently aired on Dish Network's now-defunct Voom HD channel UltraHD, along with reruns of "Fashion House".
The complete series was aired in Australia, on the Seven Network, from 3-4pm weekdays and also on Foxtel's W channel on Saturday mornings .

Max Bielschowsky

Max Bielschowsky (February 19, 1869 – August 15, 1940) was a German neuropathologist born in Breslau.
After receiving his medical doctorate from the University of Munich in 1893, he worked with Ludwig Edinger (1855-1918) at the Senckenberg Pathology Institute in Frankfurt-am-Main. At Senckenberg he learned histological staining techniques from Carl Weigert (1845-1904). From 1896 to 1904 he worked in Emanuel Mendel's (1839-1907) psychiatric laboratory in Berlin. In 1904 he joined Oskar Vogt (1870-1959) at the neurobiological laboratory at the University of Berlin, where he remained until 1933. Later in his career he worked at the psychiatric clinic at the University of Utrecht, and at the Cajal Institute in Madrid.
Bielschowsky made important contributions in his research of tuberous sclerosis, amaurotic idiocy, paralysis agitans, Huntington’s chorea and myotonia congenita. He is remembered for his histopathological work with disseminated sclerosis, the use of an histological silver stain for impregnation of nerve fibers, and with Stanley Cobb, the development of intravital silver staining. The eponymous "Bielschowsky silver stain" technique was an improvement on the method developed by Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934).

<doc id="9909034" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9909034" title="Environment Court of New Zealand">
Environment Court of New Zealand

The Environment Court of New Zealand (Māori: Te Kooti Taiao o Aotearoa) is a specialist court for plans, resource consents and environmental issues. It mainly deals with issues arising under the Resource Management Act, meaning that it covers a wide range of potential future effects of planning applications, which can include such areas as traffic congestion, noise/pollution emissions and social and commercial consequences, rather than just the 'ecological' aspects that could be implied by the 'environmental' term.
History.
The history of independent appeal courts addressing environmental matters began with the establishment of Appeal Boards under the Town and Country Planning Act 1953. The first planning appeals were heard in February 1955. The Appeal Boards were replaced by the Planning Tribunal following the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977. 
The Environment Court replaced the Planning Tribunal as a result of the Resource Management Amendment Act 1996.
Jurisdiction.
The Environment Court has a substantially larger role than the Planning Tribunal, with expanded functions and powers over planning, resource consents and enforcement. Virtually all important processes and decisions under the Resource Management Act 1991, such as regional policy statements, regional and district plans, resource consents and water conservation orders, may be appealed to the Environment Court. 
In particular, the Environment Court hears appeals on decisions on applications for resource consent on a 'de novo' basis. The Environment Court does not review the decision: it hears any evidence it requires and makes its own decision, which replaces that of the local authority. It focuses on "the merits and substance of the particular decision at issue, not the deliberative process of the executive authority that made the initial decision."
The Environment Court also has the power to make declarations that interpret the law under the Resource Management Act. 
The Environment Court has the status and powers of a District Court, so it can conduct prosecutions and enforcement of the Resource Management Act through civil or criminal proceedings.
The Environment Court also has functions under other statutes:
Decisions of the Environment Court may only be appealed to the High Court of New Zealand on a point of law.
Structure.
The Environment Court is a single court, but it has no centralised courthouse and it sits in courthouses across the country. Judges for the court are permanently stationed in Wellington, Auckland, and Christchurch, but they travel to other centres on circuit as needed.

<doc id="9909059" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9909059" title="Coat of arms of the Department of Magdalena">
Coat of arms of the Department of Magdalena

The coat of arms of Magdalena was officially adopted by the Departmental Assembly out of the winning design presented by native painter Álvaro Corvacho.
Design.
The "elegant" shape of the escutcheon or shield is a combination of two distinct designs, the top, with its three tips is from a Swiss design, the bottom with the tip issuing out from the middle is from a French design. The shield is embraced by an olive branch on either side, a symbol of peace. It has a tincture of azure, but in variant versions the field changes of tincture on both chief and base; in the modern version, the azure or blue represent Magdalena River and the Caribbean Sea. The shield is divided in two by a horizontal band which bears the flag of the Department of Magdalena in the background and in front of it the National Pantheon which is a structure located in Magdalena in the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino that honours the Libertador and the fallen heroes of the nation, the superimposition of the structure on the flag symbolizes the integrity and firmness in the souls of the Magdalenenses as well as keeping alive his dream. On chief, that is the part that is on the top, bears the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta with the radiant sun issuing from behind. The official blazon calls for a snow topped mountain as it would look naturally, i.e. proper, but this leaves the possibility of a representation of the base and hill of the mountain to be coloured green or brown as both are natural colours for mountains. The blazon also calls for a river in vert or green, which is supposed to represent the Magdalena River, this being a more natural representation of the river as it waters are far from being the typical blue shown in heraldry, this however, has been left out of the modern representations of the coat of arms, choosing instead to attribute the blue background as the river. Both of these geographical features represent their importance to the region, its extreme geography going from sea level to 5,775m above sea level, as well as the natural resources it possesses, and additionally the green of the river the hope that its inhabitants have of the department taking a national leadership position, the sun symbolizes their nobility and wisdom. The base has a Tayrona golden pendant, a typical and iconic piece of the culture of the Indigenous peoples of Magdalena.
History.
The Department of Magdalena, created in 1824 as one of the original nine Sovereign States of the United States of Colombia, originally used the Coat of arms of Colombia as the official arms of the state with the addition of an inscribed oval around the shield with the words "ESTADO SOBERANO DEL MAGDALENA" (). In 1886 the states were dissolved and departments were created instead, with the new change of governance came changes in the coat of arms. To meet this challenge the Department of Magdalena held a meeting with institutions and individuals to address this issue, and finally after different proposals were presented, the coat of arms designed by the painter Alvaro Corpacho was finally adopted as the official insignia for the department.

Prus II Wilczekosy coat of arms

Prus II Wilczekosy - is a Polish Coat of Arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
History.
From what little information we have and from what the Legends say the Prus II seal stands for particularly violent ( that's why it's named Wolfsabres ) Prussian Noble families that settled Poland in the 12 / 13th Century, particularly the lands of Mazowsze.
The following was supplied by a Mr. Leon Stevens some years ago and sheds some more light to the origins of this CoA.
Prus II is the result of the merger of families of 3 clans, namely, the original Prussian Prus Clan, the Wilczekosy Clan (a clan consisting of German settlers in the vicinity of Schillingsdorf, in old Malopolska, and the Moszczenica Clan originating in and near the village of Moszczenica in the Piotrow district. Your family did not necessarily "join" one of these clans, but may simply have always been affiliated back to ancient tribal times. Numerical designations following variants of coats of arms are arbitrarily attached by Polish heralds, and occasionally some do not agree as to which number should correspond with which variant. When nobles identified their clans in signatures etc., they did not identify variants, so that a noble would simply record, for example, "Mikolaj Olszowski h. Prus," "Mikolaj Olszowski herbu Prus," "Mikolaj Prus-Olszowski," etc.
Notable bearers.

German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)

The German National Socialist Workers' Party (, DNSAP, ) was a protofascist party of Germans in Czechoslovakia, successor of the German Workers' Party (DAP) from Austria-Hungary. It was founded in November 1919 in Duchcov. Most important party activists were Hans Knirsch, Hans Krebs, Adam Fahrner, Rudolf Jung and Josef Patzel. In May 1932 it had 1,024 local chapters with 61,000 members.
Unlike the successive sister party in Austria, which only played a marginal role in Austrian politics, the Czechoslovak branch was able to attract a considerable amount of votes because of the large Sudeten German minority in Czechoslovakia. In elections, it worked together with the "Deutsche Nationalpartei" (DNP). The party advocated cultural and territorial autonomy and anti-clericalism. It also showed anti-semitic tendencies. It organized fascist militia Volkssport. In October 1933 it was banned by the Czechoslovak government on the grounds of its anti-state activities. It was officially dissolved on 11 November 1933. DNSAP was succeeded by the Sudeten German Party.

Naupada is a village located in Santha Bommali mandal of Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is famous for salt fields and called the "Salt Bowl of Andhra Pradesh". It is better known for its railway junction station.
Geography.
Naupada is located at 18.5667N 84.3E. It has an average elevation of 5 metre (19 ft).
Transport.
Naupada railway station is 2 km from Naupada village. It is a railway junction on the Howrah-Chennai main line and express trains halt here. Naupada-Gunupur branch line was reopened in 2011 after conversion from narrow gauge to broad gauge under Project Unigauge. A passenger train runs from Gunupur to Puri and another train runs from Gunupur to Palasa.
Parlakimidi Light Railway.
The narrow gauge railway route was constructed in the year 1889 by the Maharaja of Paralakhemundi, Orissa, Sri Krishna Chandra Gajapati Narayan Deb at the cost of Rs.99 lakh. It was called Parlakimidi Light Railway.
Salt production.
Naupada Salt Fields are spread across more than 3,000 acres (12 km²) in Naupada, Moolapeta and Bhavanapadu. According to the official estimates, the quantity of salt produced by about 500 major and minor producers in and around Naupada is around 56,000 tonnes. Due to reduced prices and lack of support from government, the salt industry is almost shutting down. For the past few years the salt lands were converted to ponds for various types of aquaculture and almost polluted the land.

Unearthed (E.S. Posthumus album)

Unearthed, the first album composed by E.S. Posthumus, was originally made available for purchase online through the CD Baby website in January 2001. It became the third-biggest selling album in CDBaby's history. The success of the album prompted the wide re-release to retail in May 2005 through Wigshop and 33rd Street Records/Bayside Distribution.
A key piece to the distinctive sound of the music comes from working with the Northwest Sinfonia. In an interview with SoundtrackNet, the band said "we wanted the chance to blow an ungodly sum of cash working with a big orchestra". Other musicians performing on this CD include Pedro Eustache, Michael Landau, Matt Laug, Lance Morrison, Davy Spillane and Efrain Toro.
Track listing.
In keeping with the theme of "all things past", each of the thirteen tracks on the album is named after an ancient and abandoned or destroyed city. However, Cuzco, Nara, Isfahan, and Estremoz still survive to this day.
Media usage.
Many tracks from "Unearthed" have been featured in various movie trailers and television shows. They have been used in the trailers for movies due to their escalating structure, which makes them well-suited for the dramatic montages building towards the credits in the aforementioned trailers. 
An excerpt from the track "Nara" is used as the main theme for the CBS television show "Cold Case". A vocal rise performed by a female solo singer (Elise Morris) leads into the opening title, where one of the verses of "Nara" is then played for the remainder of the sequence, concluding with a short melody from a woodwind instrument. At the time Executive Producer Jerry Bruckheimer chose the song to be used in the show, he had never actually met the Vonlichten brothers in person. Additionally, Michael A. Levine, a musical composer for television shows and advertisements, created a reworked version of "Nara" that is played during the show's closing credits as provided by the studio (though not as shown on CBS). The track was also featured in the animation for the presentation of the design for the Beijing WaterCube by the firm architectural LAVA. 
The track "Ebla" was also used as the main menu music for the 2008 racing video game Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli.
One track from the "Unearthed" album has also been used in the BBC TV series Top Gear and its stage show, Top Gear Live.

What I've Done

"What I've Done" is a song by the American rock band Linkin Park. It was released as the first single from their third album, "Minutes to Midnight". The song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in 4/4 time. The song was released as a radio single on April 1, 2007, as a digital download on April 2, and as a CD single on April 30. The live version of "What I've Done" from ' was nominated for "Best Hard Rock Performance" at the 52nd Grammy Awards, but did not win. It also serves as the main theme of "Transformers" and also appears on '. The song was featured in the video game "Guitar Hero World Tour". In January 2011, it was released in a Linkin Park DLC pack for "Rock Band 3", along with a PRO mode update, which allows use of real instruments such as guitar, keyboards and electronic drumkits. The song is also a b-side to the UK single of "Iridescent". An instrumental version of the song is currently used by Sky as background music for their interactive services.
Composition.
Chester Bennington described the track in a March 2007 interview with MTV:
The single and video appeared in the iTunes Store shortly after midnight EST on April 2, 2007. It became available the day after on iTunes in the UK and Australia. On April 2, the song was featured streaming on the front page of their official website, with the video being added to the site shortly thereafter.
The song starts out with a short 3-second guitar part and then a piano motif, before adding a hip hop-inspired drum line, and then introducing a raw-sounding guitar riff. When the song is played live at Linkin Park's concerts, Mike Shinoda plays the piano intro and the guitar after that. This song differs from most of Linkin Park's songs from previous albums in that it features almost no lead vocals from vocalist Mike Shinoda, with the exception of a brief "na na na" refrain at the end. "What I've Done" was the last song written for "Minutes to Midnight". The song also has a downbeat exactly once every second, consistent throughout its entirety.
Mike Shinoda created a remix of the song, which is called "What I've Done (Distorted Remix)", which is included as a b-side to "Bleed It Out". The remix was then included in the international tour edition of "Minutes to Midnight", as well as a track in the Linkin Park Underground-exclusive CD "Undergound X: Demos".
Music video.
The music video for "What I've Done" starts off with some grass sinking down into the dirt, causing it to turn wet. Then it cuts to a scorpion walking to where the band is performing. It explores the many ironies of humanity and its ill effects on the earth and the environment. It juxtaposes various pieces of footage: a large, well-fed man eating fast food, a woman measuring her waist and a man who is so malnourished that his ribcage is visible through his skin; African Americans being hosed down by the Ku Klux Klan; nuclear explosions, the World Trade Center towers collapsing, children waving American flags (one of the children being Brad Delson), a Middle Eastern child holding an AK-47, clips of oil tankers torn in half and birds covered in an oil slick. The band's turntablist Joe Hahn directed the video for the single, which was shot in the California desert. The video premiered on April 2, 2007 on MTV and Fuse. It premiered on MTV Asia, MTV Germany, TMF Netherlands and Canada's MuchMusic on April 3, 2007. 
It features footage of the band performing in the desert, interspersed with stock footage reflecting on a variety of social and environmental issues including pollution, global warming, racism, Nazism, the Ku Klux Klan, abortion, starvation, terrorism, Holocaust, warfare and nuclear warfare, deforestation, poverty, drug addiction, obesity, destruction, rising gasoline prices and crimes committed by humanity. The video also features short views of important historical figures, such as (in order of appearance) Mother Teresa, Robert Kennedy, Mahatma Gandhi, Gautama Buddha, Mao Zedong, Abraham Lincoln, Fidel Castro, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein and Benito Mussolini. Some cut scenes like the traffic scene and the napalm exploding were also featured on the Rise Against music video for "Ready To Fall". The video ends off with the same grass at the beginning growing out of the dirt.
The video clip was featured and won on MTV's "Battle of the Videos" against videos by Evanescence ("Sweet Sacrifice") and Lil' Mama ("Lip Gloss"). The video also marks the first appearance of a Linkin Park video in the #1 spot on MTV's TRL, hitting #1 six times so far. The video has over 100 million views overall on YouTube. AOL currently has a live performance of "What I've Done" on their website. MTV's James Montgomery called "What I've Done" the "biggest, baddest and best Linkin Park video of all time," praising the visuals as well as the numerous political figures and events occurring within the video. He summarized the video's message: "Hahn was smart — or brave — enough to inject a message here: the destructive power of man versus the unyielding beauty of nature, and where it all will undoubtedly end (hint: we lose)."
When the band's logo is shown for the first time in the video (on the front of Rob's bass drum), it features a complete circle with the stylized letters "LP" within it. However, every time the logo is shown after this, the circle is not complete, being "separated" by two blank spaces above the "L" and below the "P". This is explained in "Making of What I've Done", where the band shows the original drums that were incorrectly made, and that they had to use black tape to make the breaks in the circle.
Chester's jacket was lent to him by Yellowcard frontman Ryan Key as mentioned in an episode (Episode 89) of MTV Cribs.
Alternate music video.
A second video, made exclusively for Australia, features a considerably different scenario from the first; instead of clips of human sin and the grass sinking clip, the video tells the story of a woman (played by Emma Mullings) working at a government-run pharmaceutical company learning of a plan to develop a deadly new virus for "social control", and - with the help of several people dressed in black hooded sweatshirts with Linkin Park's logo on them - smuggles out several blood samples of a human test subject of the virus to expose the conspiracy. The video can be seen on YouTube and Linkin Park's Australian website.
Chart performance.
The song made big debuts on the US charts during the chart week of April 21, 2007. The song debuted in the top 10 of the US Hot 100 on April 10, 2007, at #7. It is the band's second highest debut to date on the chart (this title was previously held by "Somewhere I Belong" which opened at #47), earning "Hot Shot" debut of the week, and subsequently becoming the third highest position for a Linkin Park single to date on the Hot 100. The song was their highest debut until they released "New Divide" in May 2009. At the time of its debut it was only the eleventh song since 2000 to debut at #7 or higher on the Hot 100, and only the third song to do so by an artist not from "American Idol". The song was partly fueled by digital sales, debuting at #4 on the digital chart. It had sold over 3,000,000 downloads by early 2011 since its release, making it their most successful digital song in the US.
In addition the song became only the third song ever to open at #1 on the Modern Rock chart, also becoming the band's seventh number one on the chart. It held the #1 spot on Alternative Songs for 15 consecutive weeks, at the time tying it with Marcy Playground's "Sex and Candy" The song also reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart, where it stayed for 8 consecutive weeks. In the iTunes music store, the song had reached number two. It was kept out of the top spot by "Give It to Me" by Timbaland. The music video is the first to reach the number 1 spot on TRL for Linkin Park video history. It has also become a moderate hit on the Adult Top 40, and Pop 100 Airplay charts, peaking at number 21 and 17 respectively on those charts.
The song hit #6 in the UK once the physical format was released, making it Linkin Park's highest-charting UK single.

Dennis Canon

The Dennis Canon is a common (though unofficial and unfavored) name used for Title I.7.4 (as presently numbered) of the Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (also called The Episcopal Church, or TEC).
The Canon seeks to impose a trust, in favor of TEC, on property held by a local group of Episcopal adherents (whether a parish, mission, or ). The Canon's intended effect is to discourage a local group from withdrawing from TEC, as under the Dennis Canon such property would revert to TEC.
In light of the larger doctrinal controversies surrounding TEC, and the decision of some local congregations (and dioceses) to withdraw from TEC, the Canon has surfaced in litigation between church or diocese factions regarding ownership of property.
Canon Text.
The Canon states:
History and Purpose.
The Dennis Canon is named after Walter Dennis, an attorney and later Suffragan Bishop of New York, who drafted the Canon. It was passed by the 66th General Convention in 1979, having been introduced by the Committee on Canons of the House of Bishops as D-024 of that Convention.
During the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, some parishes left the Episcopal Church and attempted to retain the parish property for reasons including the admission of women to Holy Orders, the adoption of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, and the belief that some bishops held heretical views 
In 1979, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Jones v. Wolf that the "neutral principles of law" approach to deciding property disputes between factions of a church offered advantages vs. other means (which may have required involvement in matters of purely religious affairs, an exercise which was prohibited by the First Amendment):
The Supreme Court went on to state (in response to the dissent, emphasis added):
As such, the Dennis Canon was written in response to the Supreme Court's ruling, by modifying TEC's Canons to create an express trust in favor of TEC should a faction of a local parish seek to withdraw from TEC. The Episcopal Church maintains that, legally, any officer of any official institution must maintain his/her fiduciary trust responsibility on behalf of the Episcopal Church. Thus attempts to transfer any property to another ecclesiastical jurisdiction, such as a Continuing Anglican church, violate U.S. law.
Litigation Involving the Dennis Canon.
In recent years, some Episcopalians have challenged the Episcopal Church over its doctrine, discipline, and worship. Because of these disputes, parishes and five entire dioceses have made attempts to sever ties with the rest of the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church maintains that these groups cannot dissociate, only individuals can. Therefore, Episcopal Church leaders assert that they have attempted to take property and assets with them. Those groups that have left maintain that most of these properties and assets were established long before the Dennis Canon by loyal Episcopalians that would not recognize the theological innovations of the modern Episcopal Church.
To date, there have been a number of court cases either challenging or seeking to enforce the Dennis Cannon and few of them are entirely resolved.
Virginia.
In the Commonwealth of Virginia, where a Civil War era "division statute", concerning denominations that split in two, has ruled in favor of the Episcopal Church (though the question of the Episcopal Church's trust interest was not ultimately addressed). The congregations seeking to leave (which include, among others, The Falls Church, the historic congregation for which the city of Falls Church, Virginia is named, and where George Mason and George Washington were once members) had their initial court victory overruled when using the "division statute" by the Virginia Supreme Court in 2010, which held that the statute did not apply because instead of simply leaving the Episcopal denomination to form their own organization, the churches instead joined another organization affiliated with the Church of Nigeria, which had never been part of the Protestant Episcopal Church even though both were descended from the Church of England. In January, 2012, the Fairfax Circuit Court issued an order implementing the Supreme Court's decision. Some of the churches in the suit have reached settlements with the Diocese, but others have appealed.
South Carolina.
Another case is All Saints Parish in Waccamaw, South Carolina. In this case, the Parish of All Saints won ownership of all property and assets after a lengthy court battle that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Following "neutral principles of law," the state Supreme Court held that, since the parish existed before the formation of either the diocese or the Episcopal Church, and in light of an earlier quitclaim deed, the Dennis Canon did not apply. The local State court held that: "It is an axiomatic principle of law that a person or entity must hold title to property in order to declare that it is held in trust for the benefit of another or transfer legal title to one person for the benefit of another." Subsequent to that case, the Diocese of South Carolina voted in 2012 to dissociate from the Episcopal Church. This case is still in early stages, and has yet to have a full trial in state courts. It remains to be seen whether this case will have significant bearing, but at the center of this issue is the legality of the Dennis Canon.
Georgia and Connecticut.
Two churches (from Georgia and Connecticut), where the state Supreme Courts ruled in favor of TEC and the Canon, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeals.
The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in the Connecticut case while the Georgia case was dismissed by the Supreme Court pursuant to its Rule 46.
Texas.
Two cases from Texas involving breakaway groups, and ultimately ownership to church property, were decided in August 2013; in both cases the Texas Supreme Court remanded the cases to the trial court. In its orders, the Court ruled that the "neutral principles" methodology would apply in these and all future cases involving religious groups:
The Texas cases and the "neutral principles of law" approach that the Texas Supreme Court ordered the trial court to use appears to favor the break-away groups and calls into question the enforceability or legal solidity of the Canon.

1922 NSWRFL season

The 1922 New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership was the fifteenth season of Sydney's top-grade rugby league football club competition, Australia's first. Nine teams from across the city contested the season which culminated in North Sydney's victory over Glebe in the premiership final.
Season summary.
After 18 Rounds of competition Norths and Glebe were tied atop the Points Table. Instead of the points differential rule being implemented a Grand Final was held to determine the premier. 
St George and University had very disappointing seasons winning only 2 games. St George conceded 316 points while University conceded 287, averaging 19.75 and 19.13 per game respectively.
Final.
As North Sydney and Glebe were tied on competition points a final was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 6 September, before a crowd of around 15,000. The match was officiated by Tom McMahon, the elder of the two pre-war referees of that name.
The game was not as even as the ladder at the end of regular season would have suggested. Norths completely got away to a 10-0 lead at half-time and went on to demolish Glebe 35-3, taking their second consecutive premiership crown. The legendary Harold Horder scored twenty individual points in the match.
North Sydney 35 (Tries: Rule 2, Blinkhorn 2, Horder 2, Peters. Goals: Horder 7 ) 
defeated
Glebe 3 (Try: E Summers)

Maria Hermosa

Maria "Mari" Hermosa is a supporting character in the independent comic "" created by Javier Hernandez and published under his own comic-book imprint, Los Comex. Despite being mentioned in the first issue, Maria is never seen (albeit a photograph). It is not until the second issue in the series, ""El Muerto: Mish-Mash"" that she makes her début in which she had no dialogue. Actress Angie Cepeda portrayed her in the 2007 film adaptation.
Fictional character history.
Maria is the love-interest of Diego de la Muerte, a young resident of Whittier, California. After finally winning her heart, she became his first girlfriend. He would affectionately call her “Mari” and enjoyed going to the beach with her to watch the sunset. After eight months however, she decided to end the relationship with Diego citing that he was taking her for granted.
Trying to get over his recent break-up, Diego decided to go to a local Dia de los Muertos celebration. Unfortunately for Diego, he crashed his vehicle en route to the festival ending his life on the human realm. Abducted by the gods of death and destiny, Diego is sacrificed and sent back to earth one year after his death as a servant to the god of death.
In other media.
Film adaptation.
In the live-action film adaption Maria is played by Colombian actress Angie Cepeda.
In "El Muerto" some of Maria's character origins have been changed. In the film, she is known as Maria Somera, the niece of the Padre of the local mission. The Somera family bloodline dates back to the very first Christian missionaries to settle the southwest in the time of Cortés. Also, Maria does not break up with Diego prior to the Dia de los Muertos celebration or at any other time.

<doc id="9909291" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9909291" title="Unified Video Decoder">
Unified Video Decoder

Unified Video Decoder (UVD), previously called Universal Video Decoder, is the AMD's hardware SIP core that performs video decoding. UVD is integrated into some of the AMD GPUs and APUs, and it supports hardware decoding of H.264 and VC-1 video codec standards. UVD occupies a considerable amount of the die surface and is not to be confused with AMD's Video Codec Engine (VCE).
Operating system support.
The UVD SIP core needs to be supported by the device driver, which provides one or more interfaces such as VDPAU, VAAPI or DXVA. One of these interfaces is then used by end-user software, for example VLC media player or GStreamer, to access the UVD hardware and make use of it.
AMD's proprietary device driver AMD Catalyst is available for multiple operating systems and support for UVD has been added to it. Additionally, a free device driver is available, which also supports the UVD hardware.
Linux.
Support for UVD has been available in AMD's proprietary driver Catalyst version 8.10 since October 2008 through X-Video Motion Compensation (XvMC) or X-Video Bitstream Acceleration (XvBA). Since April 2013, UVD is supported by the free and open-source "radeon" device driver through Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (VDPAU). An implementation of VDPAU is available as Gallium3D state tracker in Mesa 3D.
On , Phoronix published some benchmarks on using Unified Video Decoder through the VDPAU interface running MPlayer on Ubuntu 14.04 with version 10.3-testing of Mesa 3D.
Windows.
Windows supported UVD since it was launched. UVD currently only supports DXVA (DirectX Video Acceleration) API specification for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms to allow video decoding to be hardware accelerated, thus the media player software also has to support DXVA to be able to utilize UVD hardware acceleration.
Others.
Support for running custom FreeRTOS-based firmware on the Radeon HD 2400's UVD core (based on an Xtensa CPU), interfaced with a STM32 ARM-based board via I2C, was attempted as of January 2012.
Features.
UVD/UVD+.
The UVD is based on an ATI Xilleon video processor, incorporated into the same die as the GPU and part of the ATI Avivo HD for hardware video decoding, along with the Advanced Video Processor (AVP). UVD, as stated by AMD, handles decoding of H.264/AVC, and VC-1 video codecs entirely in hardware. The UVD technology is based on Xtensa processor from Tensilica, Inc. (later Cadence Design Systems, Inc.), which was originally licensed by ATI Technologies Inc. in 2004. However, video post-processing is passed to Pixel shaders and OpenCL Kernels. MPEG-2 decoding is not performed within UVD, but in the shader processors. The decoder meets the performance and profile requirements of Blu-ray and HD DVD, decoding H.264 bitstreams up to a bitrate of 40 Mbit/s. It has context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) support for H.264/AVC.
Unlike video acceleration blocks in previous generation GPUs, which demanded considerable host-CPU involvement, UVD offloads the entire video-decoder process for VC-1 and H.264 except for video post-processing, which is offloaded to the shaders. MPEG-2 decode is also supported, but the bitstream/entropy decode is not performed for MPEG-2 video in hardware. Previously, neither ATI Radeon R520 series' ATI Avivo nor NVidia Geforce 7 series' PureVideo assisted front-end bitstream/entropy decompression in VC-1 and H.264 - the host CPU performed this work. UVD handles VLC/CAVLC/CABAC, frequency transform, pixel prediction and inloop deblocking, but passes the post processing to the shaders. Post-processing includes denoising, de-interlacing, and scaling/resizing. AMD has also stated that the UVD component being incorporated into the GPU core only occupies 4.7 mm² in area on 65 nm fabrication process node.
A variation on UVD, called UVD+, was introduced with the Radeon HD 3000 series. UVD+ support HDCP for higher resolution video streams. But UVD+ was also being marketed as simply UVD.
UVD 2.
The UVD saw a refresh with the release of the Radeon HD 4000 series products. The UVD 2 features full bitstream decoding of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, VC-1, as well as iDCT level acceleration of MPEG2 video streams. Performance improvements allow dual video stream decoding and Picture-in-Picture mode. This makes UVD2 full BD-Live compliant.
UVD 2.2.
The UVD 2.2 features a re-designed local memory interface and enhances the compatibility with MPEG2/H.264/VC-1 videos. However, it was marketed under the same alias as "UVD 2 Enhanced" as the "special core-logic, available in RV770 and RV730 series of GPUs, for hardware decoding of MPEG2, H.264 and VC-1 video with dual-stream decoding". The nature of UVD 2.2 being an incremental update to the UVD 2 can be accounted for this move.
UVD 3.
UVD 3 adds support for additional hardware MPEG2 decoding (entropy decode), DivX and Xvid via MPEG-4 Part 2 decoding (entropy decode, inverse transform, motion compensation) and Blu-ray 3D via MVC (entropy decode, inverse transform, motion compensation, in-loop deblocking). along with 120 Hz stereo 3D support, and is optimized to utilize less CPU processing power.
Support for Blu-ray 3D stereoscopic display
UVD 4.
UVD 4 includes improved frame interpolation with H.264 decoder.
UVD 4.2.
Introduced with AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series.
Availability.
Originally, ATI planned to implement the UVD in its RV550 series GPU aimed at mainstream market, with two different specifications in which one features HDMI and video out support another featuring DVI as well as video-out support, and production was in December 2006, revealed by the slides. However, as of the current date, no information is available about the release of related products. Some suggested the RV550 products were for OEMs, while some speculated the product was cancelled.
Most of the Radeon HD 2000 series video cards implement the UVD for hardware decoding of 1080p high definition contents. However, the Radeon HD 2900 series video cards do not include the UVD (though it is able to provide partial functionality through the use of its shaders), which was incorrectly stated to be present on the product pages and package boxes of the add-in partners' products before the launch of the Radeon HD 2900 XT, either stating the card as featuring ATI Avivo HD or explicitly UVD, which only the former statement of ATI Avivo HD is correct. The exclusion of UVD was also confirmed by AMD officials. 
UVD2 is implemented in the Radeon RV7x0 and R7x0 series GPUs. This also includes the RS7x0 series used for the AMD 700 chipset series IGP motherboards.
UVD-enabled GPUs.

Rhondda Roundabout

Rhondda Roundabout (1934) was the first published novel by the Welsh writer Jack Jones.
The story is set in the Rhondda Valley in the early 1930s. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of the peoples, set against the backdrop of the aftermath of the 1926 United Kingdom General Strike and the Great Depression in the United Kingdom in the South Wales Valleys. It is principally seen through the eyes of a newly ordained chapel minister, the Reverend Dan Price.
The story is peopled with colourful characters who mostly struggle to live their lives during the economic troubles. They include Dan's uncle, Shoni Lloyd, an ex-First World War soldier and confirmed non-chapel goer, Morgan 'Big Mog' Morgan, an ex-miner, ex-soldier and now a successful bookie and philanthropist, and David 'Dai Hippo' Daniels, an ex-miner and firebrand communist activist.

<doc id="9909315" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9909315" title="Rough for Radio II">
Rough for Radio II

Rough for Radio II is a radio play by Samuel Beckett. It was written in French in 1961 as Pochade radiophonique and published in "Minuit" 16, November 1975. Beckett translated the work into English shortly before its broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 13 April 1976. Martin Esslin directed Harold Pinter (Animator), Billie Whitelaw (Stenographer) and Patrick Magee (Fox). The English-language version was first published in "Ends and Odds" (Grove, 1976, Faber, 1977) as Radio II.
Esslin tells us that Beckett himself “regard the work as unfinished, no more than a rough sketch, and felt, having heard the production that it had ‘not come off’.” Beckett "put the blame on the script but he told Esslin that 'the production which made the Animator and his team start briskly and become more weary and discouraged as time went on should already have started on a high degree of weariness and despair.'"
Synopsis.
A man, who we discover has the title “Animator” makes small talk with his young female stenographer: is she ready to get to work, does she have the tools of her trade? The interchange is light and familiar. He then consults a character called Dick; is he on his toes? The man, a mute, doesn’t answer other than to make a swishing noise to which the Animator exclaims, “Wow! Let’s hear it land.” Dick strikes the desk with, what the text refers to as, a “bull’s pizzle”, a whip made from a bull's penis. (‘Dick’ is, of course, a euphemism for penis). It is certainly humorous, though hardly revolutionary, to use a character that is unable to speak in a radio play. What is of interest is that it is his job to encourage Fox "to" speak.
Dick is instructed to remove a hood from a fourth figure, Fox, followed by his gag, blindfold and earplugs. The man is kept bound though. As his eyes adjust to the light he recognises “the same old team” – evidently this is not then the first time he has been interrogated. Unexpectedly he smiles at the woman and this startles her, which prompts a coarse remark from the Animator: “What is it, miss? Vermin in the lingerie?” This is not the first time he has smiled; she checks to see if it should be recorded but is told not to.
The Stenographer proceeds to read her report on the results from day before but the Animator has her skip practically all of it apart from the first three “exhortations”. Item #3 expresses particular concern regarding the condition and use of the Fox’s gag. It is imperative he make no utterance that cannot be recorded and scrutinized in case what he says “"may be it"”. “But no word, says Mauthner, can have such transcendent power; however tortured, words cannot reveal truth.”
She is stopped just after this and goes on to read Fox’s closing remarks from the day before which refer to him washing and drying a mole in front of a fire before returning the creature to its “chamber with his weight of grubs.” From the expression, “in that instant his little heart was beating still” it could be construed that the mole was actually dead, perhaps killed by accident when he was a child but more likely frozen to death in the blizzard he has to endure to return it to the ground.
The Animator wants to know if the glare bothers her. The woman says not and adds that heat doesn’t trouble her either but still asks permission to remove her overall. This – predictably – prompts comment from the Auditor: “Staggering! Ah were I but … forty years younger”, another inappropriate remark underlining his lascivious nature. The text does not comment on what she is – or is not – wearing underneath but Billie Whitelaw’s observation in a Radio Times interview is revealing: “I felt that the girl I play, the stenographer, starts out in uniform and ends with nothing on.” Her response is to reread the end of Fox’s last testimony: “Ah my God my God ["Blow with pencil"] My God,” words that remind one of someone’s cries while in a state of sexual ecstasy but presented in the least erotic of tones. Having worked with him before she is doubtless well aware of the nature of the man she is dealing with – someone who could undress her with his eyes no matter what she was wearing – and his hidden agenda. Her response annoys him. He calls her a “Crabbed youth,” before proceeding.
She recommends “a touch of kindness” be applied to Fox, “perhaps just a hint.” The Animator says he appreciates the sentiment but is obdurate: they stick with his method (despite its obvious lack of results).
After further prompting by Dick, Fox begins his second monologue describing a life underground (perhaps the mole’s he spoke of before), “living dead in the stones.” He fades away but, when threatened with the whip again, moves onto his third outpouring, where he mentions a brother – the first family member he has spoken of – his twin, actually inside himself and hungry. Someone named “Maud” – the only person he has ever mentioned by name – has proposed a Caesarean section volunteering to nurse the twin when born. At this point Fox breaks down and starts weeping. The Animator remains undecided as to whether this should be recorded. Up until this point he has been adamant that only Fox’s words are relevant.
A final stoke of Dick’s pizzle brings only one line. Fox – or more likely the mole/twin – cries out: “Let me out! Peter out in the stones!” 
In a change of tactic, the Animator quietly tries to make clear to Fox what he really wants: “More variety! … stonish me.”, He even hints to him that he might try being creative with the truth, the very notion of which shocks the Stenographer. It may seem at first look that the bound protagonist is the captive, but by this stage of the play, the audience is beginning to realise that the Stenographer and Animator are the ones who are truly captive. They hang upon every word Fox emits. The Animator even confesses that he doesn’t know precisely what he is looking for other than he’ll know it when he hears it, unlike Bam in "What Where" who is after specific details. It is becoming clearer that the Animator is seeking something in Fox that most likely isn’t there.
Since physical violence hasn’t proved successful, nor has gentle persuasion, the Animator modifies his approach once more: “Dick! – no, wait. Kiss him, miss, perhaps that will stir some fibre … on his stinker of a mouth … Till it bleeds! Kiss it white!” Fox howls and faints.
Since nothing more is to be gotten from Fox the two review the evidence, the tear – he had shed a number the previous winter – and Maud’s willingness to act as a wet nurse. The Stenographer highlights the point that, for Maud to be able to produce milk pointed to the fact she is likely already pregnant. The Animator drools over the image of a milk-engorged breast: “One can almost see it!”
The woman wonders out loud who might be the father. This finally fires Animator’s imagination: “May we have that passage again, miss?” She reads it verbatim but he objects insisting she is omitting the phrase, “"between two kisses".” She tries to stand her ground but he gets angry and demands she amend her notes accordingly effectively “insert the Stenographer (and her kissing of Fox) into Fox’s discourse.” (This is in violation of Item #2 of the “exhortations”). She acquiesces and timidly reads back the text. Finally, something to appeal to his crude tastes.
He is now satisfied and is hopeful that by the next day their work may very well be done. “Don’t cry, miss, dry your pretty eyes and smile at me. Tomorrow, who knows, we may be free.” This reminds us of the ending of "Radio I": “Tomorrow … noon.” Everything will be better tomorrow. Beckett brings many of his characters to this brink (e.g. Clov at the end of Endgame) but for these trapped souls the future only turns out to be an endless succession of today's.
Interpretation.
Scholars have demonstrated a fondness for grouping Beckett’s works according to perceived themes: memory plays, political plays, ghost plays and so on. "Rough for Radio II" can easily sustain a political interpretation (one wonders how much it influenced Pinter’s own "One for the Road", for example) but alternative readings can also be made of the other so-called ‘political’ plays. These plays, "Catastrophe" and "What Where" can also be grouped along with "Rough for Theatre II" and "Rough for Radio II" as ‘procedural’ plays.
Whereas many of Beckett’s work have a circular aspect, these four plays all have a linear core; each can be, or is, stopped when certain conditions are met. In the case of "Catastrophe", when the living statue meets the director’s aesthetic criteria; in "What Where", when one of the interrogators extracts the required information; in "Rough for Theatre II", when a decision is made as to Croker’s future and in "Rough for Radio II", if an unknown sign or set of words is provided by Fox. Each play has its own process, procedures that have to be followed. All evoke bureaucracy even though in "What Where" there is no physical paperwork "per se".
Robert Sandarg has put forward this short possible synopsis of the play:
As regards a ‘true’ interpretation a good starting point is Martin Esslin’s comment that the play is “about the artistic process” itself which Beckett by no means found easy; his output is respectable but he was not exactly prolific. “There are two moments worthwhile in writing,” he summed up to a friend, “the one where you start and the other where you throw it in the waste-paper basket.”
The play interestingly reverses the act of creation of a radio play: “instead of the sequence {text → speech → electromagnetic vibration}, we have the sequence {twitch of whip → speech → text} –first the slap of the bull’s pizzle on flesh, then Fox’s words, then the stenographer’s transcript.” To produce this article, this author – and by extension those authors quoted – first tuned into a radio broadcast (or put on a recording of one), listened to the words and then converted his understanding of them into text.
Fox.
"Which is more painful," I asked him, "writing or not writing?"<br> 
"They're both painful, but the pain is different."
An old adage says that people hear what they want to hear; they home in on what’s relevant to "them". Animator is not really listening to Fox any more than a great number of Beckett’s audiences over the years haven’t "listened" to him: Godot sounds like God so he must be God, mustn’t he? 
Fox sounds like ‘"vox"’, the Latin word for ‘voice’, but in this case it is not unreasonable to assume this is intentional on Beckett’s part considering his only requirement is to give voice to that certain something that will satisfy his interrogator. It is worth mentioning that in the French original the interrogatee is still named ‘Fox’ rather than ‘"Renard"’ perhaps because Beckett wanted his audience to make the Fox/Vox connection first. The French for ‘voice’ is ‘"voix"’.
“Fox’s stream of words presents a series of puzzling images. Should the listener simply consider each of these – the soaping of the mole, his drying by the embers, the mention of a parasitic twin brother growing within him, a mother figure named Maud – as pictograms, which escape interpretation? Fox only speaks under duress. Does he represent the artist figure, forced by habit or vocation to express himself in a series of ever-repeating motifs despite not having a specific purpose or subject? Whether or not he has something revelatory to communicate … he lives up to his name by not divulging it. As a result, his silence gives him power over his captors and even his torturer, Dick.” 
Symbols are the method that the unconscious uses to communicate important information and guidance to the conscious mind. Fox’s speech from the day before talks about returning a dead mole to his womblike chamber (with food to last it), an image centred on insertion; the first of the new day concentrates on the mole (now miraculously alive – “Live I did…) moving through tunnels seeking the way out (in fact the text shifts to a first-person narrative) whereas the final section focuses on Fox’s awareness of his twin’s hunger driving his desperate need for extraction. “Taken together, Fox’s three utterances can be seen to construct a scenario of a self-birth attempted yet blocked.” Maud says he needs to be “opened up”; as he can’t ‘open up’ himself, someone needs to step into that rôle. In "Cascando" (1962/63) this is what the controller is called, the “Opener”, after his function. His use of the term “passage” to refer to something Fox has said before emphasises that what we are hearing is the “scrabble, scrabble” of his “old twin” trying to find a way out. This culminates in the final cry: “Let me out!” 
If Fox embodies the source of raw data available to the creative process, personified by the Animator and his team, what does Fox’s twin represent? Most likely his deepest, darkest memories, memories that he has repressed (or at least suppressed). Aware that it may be these that the Animator is trying to reach Fox exercises his power over him by refusing to release them to him (“ah but no, no no”); they look as if they may ‘die’ inside him.
The metaphorical image of an author giving birth to a work of fiction is not new, nor is the picture of the “tortured artist”, nor even the assertion that all fiction is thinly veiled biography; in Beckett’s case there are biographical elements embedded throughout all his work and if a writer’s task is to get something out of himself onto the page, that something, that part of himself, could quite poetically be referred to as the twin inside him.
"Influential psychoanalysts Didier Anzieu and Bennett Simon as well as a number of Beckett critics hold that Wilfred Bion's 1950 paper on "The Imaginary Twin" is part of a fictionalised account of his treatment of Beckett some fifteen years earlier … The suspicion that the young Beckett is patient A of "The Imaginary Twin" is supported by Bion's description of his inventive analysand as a man who was adept at blurring the boundary between real and imaginary events, who made ambiguous statements that were open to multiple interpretations, who felt that he was inhabited by an unborn twin and imagined himself in a womb afraid to be born.” "The notion that Fox articulates – the me inside an I that can never be merged with the I – becomes the most dominant motif in Beckett’s writing.
“A fox is a crafty, reclusive creature, and Fox seems devoted to producing speech that dances away from any sort of devastating apprehension of meaning. On the other hand, Fox, as a 'fodient rodent', does seem to be trying to burrow towards some deep truth. He is remarkable interested in tunnels; not only does he soap a mole, but he also says at one point that he is taking to the tunnels, and the foetal or ghost twin that Fox conceals in his belly is also suggestive of his preoccupation with the interior of things ... As a tireless explorer in the labyrinth of language, as an old mole trying to convey difficult insight to the public, Fox may indeed be speaking words worth scanning for hidden meaning.” 
Fox speaks of tunnelling for his goal, ‘age upon age, up again, down again, little lichens of my little span, living dead in the stones’. The artist (or creator) as excavator or burrower is another Beckettian leitmotif. In "Proust" he speaks of ‘the labours of poetical excavation’ and states that ‘the only fertile research is excavatory, immersive, a contraction of the spirit, a descent’. He told the actress Elizabeth Bergner that he was ‘not looking for answers: I am only trying to dig a little deeper’; and he spoke to Lawrence E. Harvey ‘of the attempt to find lost self in images of getting down, getting below the surface, concentrating, listening, getting your ear down so you can hear the infinitesimal murmur. There is a grey struggle, a groping in the dark for a shadow’. The decisive comment comes in "The Unnamable": ‘Are there other pits, deeper down? To which one accedes by mine? Stupid obsession with depth’
In ""Rough for Radio II", Beckett represents the process of his own creativity as writer by an 'animator' and his secretary who takes down the utterances of a little man, who is usually gagged and blindfolded, but taken out each day and asked to speak ... monologue he utters, which is a stream of consciousness that forms the material of the writer, must be taken down according to strict rules." But the Animator breaks these rules and incorporates an idea of his own into the text. This represents the "slippage between what the artist wants to express and what he is capable of expressing. As Beckett says of Bram van Velde in the three dialogues, he was 'the first to admit that to be an artst is to fail.'" Bearing this in mind the oft quoted lines from "Worstward Ho" take on a greater significance: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."
Animator.
“The healthy man does not torture others - generally it is the tortured who turn into torturers.” - Carl Jung ("Return to the Simple Life", 1941) 
Beckett’s interest in all kinds of psychoanalytical writing is well documented. And so, when one sees a name like Anima-tor, an obvious question to ask is: is this character a personification of the character’s anima? If that is the case then what we have in "Rough for Radio II", like "Rough for Radio I", is another of Beckett’s “mindscapes”.
Jung viewed the anima process as being one of the sources of creative ability (which would make Fox the wellspring of ideas, experiences and dreams). “A complex consists of two parts; an archetypal core … (Animator) … surrounded by a cluster or shell of images, memories, and feelings … (Fox) … that are the result of childhood experiences with human beings. It is as if the archetypal core acts like a magnet, around which events cluster that belong to that archetype. This core adds energy to the complex.”
The Animator is a sensualist who imposes his grossness on his victims, Fox, an intuitive creature who lives by his senses and also his unfortunate female assistant. There is no doubt that Beckett had a sexual side to his nature though – understandably – little is on record as to how this aspect of him affected his work. His writing, although not primarily sexual, never shies away from it but one could never refer to it as ‘titillating’. That sexual urges might have distracted him from his writing is always a possibility. Anthony Cronin, in his biography, talks about the year when Beckett was struggling to complete "Murphy ". Some days he would go for long walks “from nine or ten in the morning until six or seven in the evening, scarcely seeing a soul. Telling MacGreevy about this, he said it saved masturbation.”
“The anima … holds in it an expression of a man's complex of feelings about women, gained as experience mostly from his mother – or lack of mother – but also from a synthesis of all his female contacts … A negative side to the anima that is “that of the woman/mother who poisons everything, whose … critical remarks hurt and constantly demean. This may live on in a man as self-criticism. A slight twist on this is the man who considers himself an intellectual, but actually is possessed by an anima that does not allow real creative thought, but expresses opinions and fears as clever words (“Have you read the "Purgatory", miss, of the divine Florentine?”) or arguments (“What the devil are you deriding, miss? My hearing? My memory? My good faith?”). This enables the person to feel are always right, and actually avoid any real meeting with other people or life experience. Strangely, such men are often driven to pornography, in a desperate drive to meet denied personal needs.”
Beckett stipulates that the Animator has a “cylindrical ruler”, clearly a phallic image. Dick is in no way a fully-fledged character in his own right, rather an extension of the Animator, a penis substitute (admittedly a Freudian term). The Stenographer only has a small pencil showing her place in the pecking order. (Although represented by a female she is nevertheless an aspect of a male character). There is a subtext of impotence however. The Animator is trying to get something from Fox that’s not there; he tries to read into it and, eventually, has to ‘spice up’ the text himself. “In the end it comes down to a question of bending the truth to get relief.” 
Ultimately the creative process has not been faithful to the truth but does it have to be? More than most writers, Beckett plumbed the depths of his own life for source material. Some sections are transparently biographical (e.g. the scene in "Krapp’s Last Tape" where Krapp’s mother dies) but exactly how faithful to the truth only Beckett himself would know. But it is a work of fiction, not a psychological treatise and certainly not biography in the strictest sense; the facts are bent to fit the truth of the play.

Out-of-battery

Out-of-battery refers to the status of a weapon before the action has returned to the normal firing position. The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back into its firing position in a gun battery. 
In artillery guns, "out of battery" usually refers to a situation where the recoiling mass (breech and barrel) has not returned to its proper position after firing because of a failure in the recoil mechanism. Most gun carriage designs should prevent this, however, if a gun is fired out of battery, then damage to the carriage can occur as the effectiveness of the recoil mechanism will have been compromised. 
In firearms and artillery where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition can occur in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon. The gas pressure produced at the moment of firing can rupture the not fully supported cartridge case and can result in flame and high pressure gas being vented at the breech of the weapon, potentially creating flying shrapnel possibly injuring the operator. 
There are many reports of modern pistols being damage or destroyed by out of battery discharges that has led to the use of the term kB - meaning "kaboom".

Yu Pingbo

Yú Píngbó (俞平伯) (January 8, 1900 – October 15, 1990), former name Yú Mínghéng (俞銘衡) and courtesy name Píngbó (平伯), was an essayist, poet, historian, Redologist, and critic.
Life and scholarly career.
Yú Píngbó's ancestry can be traced to Déqīng, Zhèjiāng. His pet name as a child was Sēngbǎo (僧寶). He was a descendant of Yú Yuè, a renowned scholar during the late Qīng period, and as such Yú Píngbó was trained in the Chinese classics from an early age. In 1915, he qualified by examination for a preparatory course at Peking University, where he became one of Hú Shì's most prominent students. In 1917, he married Xŭ Băoxùn (許寶馴), a gifted female scholar from Hángzhōu, and then commenced composing melodies for Kūnqŭ operas. Meanwhile, he temporarily immersed himself in the New Culture Movement, and in 1918 his first New Culture period poem "Spring Waters" (春水 "Chūnshuĭ") was published alongside Lŭ Xùn's Diary of a Madman in La Jeunesse, becoming one of the pioneering compositions to be written in contemporary Chinese vernacular. That same year, he established with classmates Fù Sīnián, Luó Jiālún and others the New Wave Society. Other intellectual friends or writers included Zhu Ziqing, Feng Youlan, and Ye Shengtao. He then went on to publish such compositions as the poem "Winter's Night" (冬夜 "Dōngyè"). Yú Píngbó graduated from Peking University in December, 1919. After graduation, Yu took a brief trip to Europe, and in 1922 spent an equally brief period in the United States, but found neither place attractive.
In 1923, Yú Píngbó published "Debating Dream of the Red Chamber" (紅樓夢辨 "Hónglóumèng Biàn"), giving evidence for his claim that only the first eighty chapters of the original "Dream of the Red Chamber" had been authored by Cáo Xŭeqín, the later forty chapters being penned by Gāo È. He thereby came to be known, along with Hú Shì, for establishing a new field in redological studies. These studies were not only important in developing an understanding of the text and its complexities, but in advancing the New Culture Movement's nationalistic project of using scientific methodology to replace old Chinese culture with a westernized version. 
In 1925 he took up post as a lecturer at Yenching University. In 1928 he went to Tsinghua University. In 1935, he founded the Tsinghua Valley Music Society (清華谷音社 "Qinghuá Gŭyīnshè") at Qinghuayuan (清華園, "Tsinghua Gardens") to popularise his Kūnqŭ compositions. In 1946, he transferred to Peking University for the post of professor. In 1935, he entered the Classical Literature Research Unit (古典文學研究室 "Gŭdiăn Wénxué Yánjiūshì") at the Literary Research Institute (文學研究所 "Wénxué Yánjiūsuŏ") of the Chinese Academy of Science, there revising his old publication "Discussing Dream of the Red Chamber" and redistributing it under the title "Researching Dream of the Red Chamber" (紅樓夢研究 "Hónglóumèng Yánjiū"), in 1954, Máo Zédōng personally launched a nation-wide campaign criticising this work along with Hú Shì's "Reactionary Thought" (反動思想 "Făndòng Sīxiăng"), a major incident of the time. During the Cultural Revolution, Yú Píngbó was persecuted further, going to one the so-called 'cadre schools' in Xī, Hénán for manual labour. On 15 October 1990, at ninety years of age, he died at the "Běijīng Sānlĭ Hénán Shāgōu Yùsuŏ" (北京三里河南沙溝寓所).

Tiny Town

Tiny Town & Railroad is a miniature village containing over 100 1/6 scale buildings and a gauge miniature railway close to Morrison, Colorado.
History.
George Turner, owner of Denver business Turner Moving & Storage and a friend of Buffalo Bill Cody, began building a miniature town for his daughter in 1915. Called Turnerville, he opened the site to the public in 1921.
Turnerville quickly became one of the state's most popular attractions, but it was plagued by damage from adjacent Turkey Creek flooding and a fire burned down the Indian pueblo in 1935. The train was added in 1939 and the name became Tiny Town.
On August 11, 2010 fifteen people were injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17 mph, causing five of the six cars to tip over. An investigation determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and throttle levers. The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.

The Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit, or CJMTK (also referred to as C/JMTK), is a replacement for the previous United States Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Mapping Toolkit (JMTK) that utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The primary component of CJMTK is ESRI's complete ArcGIS system, with additional functionality for military analysis, overlays, sensors, and data. CJTMK is now the DoD standard mapping toolkit for C2I software.
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is the U.S. Government program manager for CJMTK with Northrop Grumman IT TASC as the prime contractor. Team members include: ESRI (for the foundation technology utilizing the ArcGIS architecture), Leica Geosystems (for image processing), and Analytical Graphics (for satellite modeling).
Organizations creating C2I software for the DoD can obtain, develop on, and deploy to the DoD the CJMTK package free of charge. Non-C2I DoD programs may use the CJMTK under the Extended User Community (EUC) licensing option, for which the EUC program is responsible for the funding. Programs outside the DoD may be eligible to use the CJMTK under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) licensing option. FMS certification and funding are the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. 
The CJMTK API is available in the form of Microsoft COM+, C, C++ and Java. CJMTK supports most common geospatial data formats and protocols (see the CJMTK and ESRI sites for specifics), including, with the latest version, Google Earth's KML format.

Alakshmi

Alakshmi is the older sister of Lakshmi and the Hindu goddess of misfortune. She is also the second wife of Kali, the male demon from the Kalki Purana and the Mahabharata.
Background.
She is described as being “cow-repelling, antelope-footed, bull-toothed." Or she “has [a dry shriveled up body, sunken cheeks, thick lips, and beady eyes and that she rides a donkey." She sometimes takes the form of an owl that is portrayed accompanying Lakshmi. It is believed the owl is the representation of “arrogance and stupidity that often accompanies fortune by Lakshmi and heralds misfortune.” It is for this reason that Lakshmi's devotees are wary of the owl. There are many myths surrounding her origins. One legend says her sister was born from the radiance of Prajapati’s face, while Alakshmi was born from his back. Another says her sister was born from the churned ocean of milk, while she rose from the Kalakuta poison dripping from Vasuki Nāga’s mouth. Still others simply say both were born from the ocean of milk, but Alakshmi is always the oldest of the two. According to one source, “It was said that when she entered a household, Alakshmi brought jealousy and malice in her trail. Brothers fell out with each other, families and their male lineages (kula) faced ruin and destruction."
According to one story, Alakshmi was upset because her younger sister was wife to Vishnu and was living in the Vaikuntha paradise, while she had neither husband nor abode. Lakshmi then decreed “Mrityu, god of death, decay, and degeneration will be Alakshmi’s husband and she will dwell wherever there is dirt, ugliness, sloth, gluttony, envy, rage, hypocrisy, greed and lust.”
Connection with other goddesses.
A book on the Nakshatra constellations says the deity of the nineteenth lunar mansion of Mula is Nirriti, the goddess of destruction who has the power to “ruin, destroy or break things apart ("barhana shakti").” It also says Nirriti commonly takes the form of the goddess Kali. Alakshmi is another name for Nirriti.

John R. Gillis is Professor Emeritus of History at Rutgers University. He holds a B.A. from Amherst College and a Ph.D. from Stanford University.
Academic work.
Until recently his work was largely been in social and cultural historys. He began as a German historian, moved to British history, and then began to be interested in age relations, marriage, memory, and the cultures of European and American family life. Now he has turned to global history, with an emphasis on cultural geography and environmental history.
In 2004 he published "Islands of the Mind," an exploration of the prominent place islands have had in the western imaginary since the Ancients. In it he blends cultural history and geography, treating islands and continents as parts of an interactive whole. The book is concerned both with the role played by islands in the economic, political, and social dimensions of Atlantic world and the way the myths, images, and narratives of islands function for mainland cultures.
In recent years, Gillis has turned to the study of coasts and coastal peoples, a neglected subject in both history and geography. In a book titled "The Human Shore: Seacoasts in History," he begins with the first humans to approach the shore, tracing coastal migrations around the world before turning to the ways that coasts and coastal people have figured in globalization over several centuries. The book concludes with an assessment of the current crisis of coasts when faced with the effects of climate change, treating coasts as an ecotone that encompasses both land and water. The book was published by the University of Chicago Press in November, 2012. 
Gillis retired from Rutgers University in 2005 and since that time has lived in Berkeley, California while spending summers on Great Gott Island, off Acadia National Park in Maine. There he is actively involved with the Island Institute, located in Rockland, Maine.
He has published six books and edited four others. Gillis is a current member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Family History and , and a past editorial board member of the Journal of Modern History. He has taught at Princeton and the University of California at Berkeley, has been a visiting fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford, and is a Life Member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University.

Jason Gann

Jason Gann is an Australian actor, writer, and executive producer. He is best known for his role as the title character in the Australian comedy series "Wilfred", directed by Tony Rogers, and the U.S. remake of the same name.
Biography.
Early life.
The son of a military father and country singer mother, Gann grew up in Brisbane, Australia. At 14, while attending an all-boys school, Gann discovered his love for comedy when he performed as Suzanne, leader of the can-can dancers in a high school production of "Paint Your Wagon". After high school, he went on to study acting at the University of Southern Queensland. He earned a B.A. in Acting while also attending classes in humanities and the arts.
Early career.
Immediately following his studies, Gann moved to Brisbane where he continued studying theatre and music. He worked in children's theatre at the Twelfth Night Theatre in Bowen Hills for several years, performing in dozens of shows. He also played lead roles and toured the country in several comedy theatre productions for that theatre company. He developed and starred in several seasons of the Arts Council-funded play "Keep Everything You Love", for which he won the Del Arte Award for Best Male Actor 1997. Gann then worked for the Queensland Theatre Company as an actor in several development projects and starred in the Sven Swenson play "The Vertigo and the Virginia" for QTC in 1999.
"Wilfred" and Australian TV.
In 2001, Gann wrote and produced several short films that screened in festivals internationally. In 2002 he co-wrote and starred in the short "Wilfred". He first came to national attention when he won Best Male Actor and the short won Best Comedy and the Peoples' Choice Award at Tropfest in 2002. "Wilfred" went on to screen at festivals including Sundance Film Festival in 2003.
Gann won the Tropfest Best Male Actor award again in 2003 for "Buried". He then appeared in Australian feature films including "Gettin' Square", "Thunderstruck", "The Illustrated Family Doctor", and "Kenny".
In 2004, for Australian TV, Gann appeared in two episodes of "Blue Heelers" and had a cameo on "Kath and Kim". In 2006, Gann wrote and starred in 52 episodes of the sketch comedy show "The Wedge" on Australia's Network Ten. Gann then created, produced, wrote and starred in the network's spin-off comedy series "Mark Loves Sharon". The following year, Gann co-created and played the title character for the Australian comedy series "Wilfred", based on the short film. It ran for two seasons, both of which went on to win awards at Tropfest in 2007 and 2009.
US Television.
In 2010, Renegade Films sold the Australian format of "Wilfred" to the U.S. network FX. Faced with redeveloping the show for an American market, Gann teamed with "Family Guy" executive producer David Zuckerman. Actor Elijah Wood signed on to co-star with Gann. The "Wilfred" debut became FX's highest-rated comedy series debut.
Awards and Nominations.
In 2007 and 2010, Gann was nominated for an AFI Award for Best Male Performance in a Comedy Series. In 2007 he won for Best Comedy Series, for "Wilfred", and in 2010 he won for Best Screenplay in a Television Series. In 2011, Gann was nominated for a Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Actor for his work on "Wilfred". He was awarded the Australian "GQ" Comedian of the Year Award for 2011, and was nominated for the annual Golden Collar Award, normally given solely to canine performers.
Personal life.
Gann married Spanish model Alejandra Varela on 4 February 2013, and the two have a son, born 13 August 2013.<br>
An animal lover, he is a celebrity spokesperson for multiple animal rights groups including Stray Cat Alliance in Los Angeles, California.<br>
In 2007, Gann plead guilty to assaulting a shuttle bus driver, Joseph Hosny, whom he repeatedly punched in the face after he and his girlfriend were left in the rain, after being refused entry onto a shuttle bus. Following these initial claims, Gann was involved in a civil legal case regarding payment of medical expenses to Hosny, who claimed that this incident caused depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, leaving him unable to work for over five years. <br>
Gann's legal counsel advised him to plead guilty in an effort to minimize the possibility of a criminal conviction which would bar Gann from producing Wilfred in the United States. Gann was ordered to pay $325,000 to Hosny.<br>
Hosny is currently in court battling 115 criminal charges including fraud by WorkCover who alleges that Hosny obtained financial advantage by deception according to Accident Compensation Act. In an interview, Gann states that WorkCover approached Gann to pay Hosny's debt. Gann has refused to pay the fees. The issue has also been covered in by the civil rights group WorkCover Victim's Diary.

Seremban railway station

The Seremban railway station is a Malaysian railway station on the west end of Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. The station is named after Seremban.
The station serves the North-South Line of the KTM Intercity train services, as well as KTM Komuter commuter train services introduced in 1995. It is the southern terminal station of the KTM Komuter's Rawang-Seremban Line.
History.
The station was constructed between 1904 to 1910 at a cost of RM26,000.00, having long served earlier railway companies before the Malayan Railway Administration (now known as the Malayan Railway) took over responsibilities of managing all lines in Malaya in 1948. The station continued to offer Intercity train services along the North-South Line, as well as offering goods deliveries.
From 6 February 1994 to 12 April 1994, the station underwent extensive remodeling in preparation for the launch of the Rawang-to-Seremban stretch of the KTM Komuter commuter train services. The renovation saw the retrofitting of new KTM Komuter facilities into the station, as well as the raising of all platforms in the station to support easier access in and out of KTM locomotives and coaches.
Platforms.
The station contains three platforms connected by a link bridge. Because the station serves as a terminal stop of the KTM Komuter commuter train service, only one line is needed for the service, used as a final stop for its southbound journey and the beginning of its northbound journey (like most EMUs, the KTM Komuter rolling stock is capable of moving backwards or forwards).
Komuter trains stop only at platform 1, a side platform directly adjoining the station building. Platforms 2 and 3 are situated on an island platform covered by a metal-framed and wooden shade, and serve Intercity train services that travel in either direction.
Architecture.
The station is essentially fashioned in a simplistic form, consisting of an oblong-planned one storey station building containing station offices at the southern half of the station, and ticketing facilities and the passenger concourse in the northern half of the building; a brick-and-plaster entranceway was also included in its earlier iteration. The station features verandahs supported by carved wooden beams sporting curved motives.
The station is covered by two layers of hip roofs: One at the bottom cut at the top by a smaller one with a large gable. A white clock tower is erected atop the roof of the building, topped by an onion dome. The top of the roof is adorned by wooden carvings and small pinnacles on its upper ends.

Territorial evolution of Poland

Poland () is a country in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania to the east; and the Baltic Sea and Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave, to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the ninth largest in Europe.
From a nucleus between the Odra and Vistula rivers on the North European Plain, Poland has at its largest extent expanded as far as the Baltic, the Dnieper, the Black Sea and the Carpathians, while in periods of weakness it has shrunk drastically or even ceased to exist.
Territorial history.
In 1492, the territory of Poland-Lithuania - not counting the fiefs of Mazovia, Moldavia and East Prussia - covered , making it the largest territory in Europe; by 1793 it had fallen to , the same size as Great Britain, and in 1795 it disappeared completely. The first 20th century incarnation of Poland, the Second Polish Republic, occupied while since 1945, a more westerly Poland covered .
The Poles are the most numerous of the West Slavs and occupy what some believe to be the original homeland of the Slavic peoples. While other groups migrated, the Polanie remained "in situ" along the Vistula, from the river's sources to its estuary at the Baltic Sea. There is no other European nation centred to such an extent on one river. The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by Mieszko I in 966 CE (see Baptism of Poland), when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. In 1025 CE, Poland became a kingdom. In 1569, Poland cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of the largest and most populous countries in 16th- and 17th-century Europe."Poland-Lithuania was another country that experienced its 'Golden Age' during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The realm of the last Jagiellons was absolutely the largest state in Europe".</ref>""the deluge," denoting the downfall of Poland, at that time the largest state in Europe, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Oder to the Dnieper River."</ref>
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had many characteristics that made it unique among states of that era. The Commonwealth's political system, often called the Noble's Democracy or Golden Freedom, was characterized by the sovereign's power being reduced by laws and the legislature (Sejm), which was controlled by the nobility (szlachta). This system was a precursor to the modern concepts of broader democracy and constitutional monarchy."enabled them to push a new constitution through the Diet, transforming Poland from an anarchic republic ... into a reasonably modern constitutional monarchy"</ref> The two comprising states of the Commonwealth were formally equal, although in reality Poland was a dominant partner in the union. Its population was hallmarked by a high level of ethnic and confessional diversity, and the state was noted for having religious tolerance unusual for its age, although the degree of tolerance varied over time.
In the late 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth began to collapse. Its neighbouring states were able to slowly dismember the Commonwealth. In 1795, Poland's territory was completely partitioned among the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire, and Austria. Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic in 1918 after World War I, but lost it in World War II through occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Poland lost over six million citizens in World War II, emerging several years later as the socialist People's Republic of Poland within the Eastern Bloc, under strong Soviet influence.
During the Revolutions of 1989, communist rule was overthrown and Poland became what is constitutionally known as the "Third Polish Republic." Poland is a unitary state made up of sixteen voivodeships (). Poland is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Poland currently has a population of over 38 million people, which makes it the 34th most populous country in the world and one of the most populous members of the European Union.
Territorial timeline.
In the period following the emergence of Poland in the 10th century, the Polish nation was led by a series of rulers of the Piast dynasty, who converted the Poles to Christianity, created a sizeable Central European state, and integrated Poland into European culture. Formidable foreign enemies and internal fragmentation eroded this initial structure in the 13th century, but consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the Polish Kingdom.
Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila, the Jagiellon dynasty (1385–1569) ruled the Polish–Lithuanian union. The Lublin Union of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity.
Duchy of Prussia.
In 1525, during the Protestant Reformation, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Hohenzollern, secularized the order's Prussian territory, becoming Albert, Duke of Prussia. His duchy, which had its capital in Königsberg, was established as a fief of the Crown of Poland.
992.
Mieszko I of Poland was the first historical ruler of Poland. He was responsible for the introduction and subsequent spread of Christianity in Poland. During his long reign most of the territories inhabited by Polish tribes of West Slavs were united into a single Polish state. The last of his conquests were Silesia and Lesser Poland that were incorporated some time before 990.
1025.
During the reign of Bolesław's the Brave, relations between Poland and the Holy Roman Empire deteriorated, resulting in a series of wars (1002–1005, 1007–1013, 1015–1018). From 1003–1004 Bolesław intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from Bohemia in 1018, Bolesław retained Moravia. In 1013 the marriage between Bolesław's son Mieszko and Richeza of Lotharingia, the niece of Emperor Otto III and future mother of Casimir I the Restorer, took place. The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the Peace of Bautzen accord, on favorable terms for Bolesław. In the context of the 1018 Kiev expedition, Bolesław took over the western part of Red Ruthenia. In 1025, shortly before his death, Bolesław I the Brave finally succeeded in obtaining the papal permission to crown himself, and became the first king of Poland.
1050.
The first Piast monarchy collapsed after the death of Boleslaw's son - king Mieszko II in 1034. Deprived of a government, Poland was ravaged by an anti-feudal and pagan rebellion, and in 1039 by the forces of Bretislaus I of Bohemia. The country suffered territorial losses, and the functioning of the Gniezno archdiocese was disrupted.
After returning from exile in 1039, Duke Casimir I (1016–1058), properly known as the Restorer have rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miecław, and in 1050 Silesia from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by the recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland. Casimir's son Bolesław II the Generous managed to restore most of the countries strength and influence and was able to crown himself king in 1076. In 1079 there was an anti-Bolesław conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Kraków. Bolesław had Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów executed; subsequently Bolesław was forced to abdicate the Polish throne because of the pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. The rule over Poland passed into the hands of his younger brother Władysław Herman.
1125.
After a power struggle, Bolesław III the Wry-mouthed (son of Władysław Herman, ruled 1102–1138) became the Duke of Poland by defeating his half-brother in 1106–1107. Bolesław's major achievement was the reconquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania, a task begun by his father and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.
At this time, Christianization of the region was initiated in earnest, an effort crowned by the establishment of the Pomeranian Wolin Diocese after Bolesław's death in 1140.
1145.
[[File:Ustawa sukcesyjna Bolesława Krzywoustego.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty:
The Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty was a political act by the Piast duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, in which he established rules for governance of the Polish kingdom by his four surviving sons after his death. By issuing it, Bolesław planned to guarantee that his heirs would not fight among themselves, and would preserve the unity of his lands under the House of Piast. However, he failed; soon after his death his sons fought each other, and Poland entered a period of fragmentation lasting about 200 years.
1238.
In the first half of the 13th century Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded, reunited much of the divided Kingdom of Poland ("Regnum Poloniae"). His expeditions led him as far north as the Duchy of Pomerania, where for a short time he held some of its southern areas. He became the duke of Kraków (Polonia Minor) in 1232, which gave him the title of senior duke of Poland (see Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty), and came into possession of most of Greater Poland in 1234. Henry failed in his attempt to achieve the Polish crown. His activity in this field was continued by his son and successor Henry II the Pious, until his sudden death in 1241 (Battle of Legnica). His successors were not able to maintain their holdings outside of Silesia, which were lost to other Piast dukes. Polish historians refer to territories acquired by Silesian dukes in this period as "Monarchia Henryków śląskich" ("The monarchy of the Silesian Henries"). In those days Wrocław was the political center of the divided Kingdom of Poland.
1248.
Few years after the death of Henry II the Pious his son - Bolesław II the Bald - sold the northwest part of his duchy - the Lubusz Land - to the to Magdeburg's Archbishop Wilbrand von Käfernburg and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. This had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border, leading to an expansion of Brandenburg possessions into the east of Odra river. As a result a wide peace of Land was annexed from Poland and Pomerania that together with Lubusz Land formed the newly established Brandenburgian province of Neumark.
1295.
In 1295, Przemysł II of Greater Poland became the first, since Bolesław II, Piast duke crowned as King of Poland, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including from 1294 Gdańsk Pomerania) and was assassinated soon after his coronation.
1300.
A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia of the Přemyslid dynasty, who married Przemysł's daughter and became King of Poland in 1300. Václav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.
1333–70.
After the death of Wenceslaus III of Bohemia - son of Wenceslaus II - in 1306, most of the Polish Lands came under the rule of duke Władysław I the Elbow-high. However at this points, various foreign states were staking their claims on some parts of Poland. Margraviate of Brandenburg invaded Pomerelia in 1308, leading Władysław I the Elbow-high to request assistance from the Teutonic Knights, who evicted the Brandenburgers but took the area for themselves, annexed and incorporated it into the Teutonic Order state in 1309 (Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Treaty of Soldin/Myślibórz). This event caused a long-lasting dispute between Poland and the Teutonic Order over the control of Gdańsk Pomerania. It resulted in a series of Polish–Teutonic Wars throughout 14th and 15th centuries.
During this time, all Silesian dukes accepted Władysław's claims for sovereignty over other Piasts. After acquiring papal consent for his coronation, all nine dukes of Silesia declared twice (in 1319 before and in 1320 after the coronation) that their realms lay inside the borders of the Polish Kingdom. However, despite formal papal consent for the coronation, Wladyslaw's right to the crown was disputed by successors of Wenceslaus III (a king of both Bohemia and Poland) on the Bohemian throne. In 1327 John of Bohemia invaded. After the intervention of King Charles I of Hungary he left Polonia Minor, but on his way back he enforced his supremacy over the Upper Silesian Piasts.
In 1329 Władysław I the Elbow-high fought with the Teutonic Order. The Order was supported by John of Bohemia who dominated the dukes of Masovia and Lower Silesia.
In 1335 John of Bohemia renounced his claim in favour of Casimir the Great, who in return renounced his claims to the Silesia province. This was formalized in the Treaty of Trentschin and Congress of Visegrád (1335), ratified in 1339 and later confirmed in the 1348 Treaty of Namslau.
King Casimir, being deprived of historically and ethnically Polish lands of Silesia and Pomerelia sought a compensation of this loses in the east. Through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366 Casimir had annexed the Halych–Volodymyr area of Rus'. The city of Lwów quickly developed to become a main town of this new region.
Allied with Denmark and Western Pomerania, Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border as well. In 1365 Drezdenko and Santok became Poland's fiefs, while Wałcz district was in 1368 taken outright, severing the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connecting Poland with Farther Pomerania.
1635.
Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (also known as Treaty of Sztumska Wieś or Treaty of Stuhmsdorf) in 1635, favourable to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in terms of territorial concessions.
1655.
In the history of Poland and Lithuania, the Deluge refers to a series of wars in the mid-to-late 17th century that left the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in ruins.
The Deluge refers to the Swedish invasion and occupation of the western half of Poland-Lithuania from 1655 to 1660 and the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648, which led to Russia's invasion during the Russo-Polish War. 
1657.
The Treaty of Wehlau was a treaty signed on September 19, 1657, in the eastern Prussian town of Wehlau (Welawa, now Znamensk) between Poland and Brandenburg-Prussia during the Swedish Deluge. The treaty granted independence to Prussia in recognition of its help against the Swedish forces during the Deluge.
1660.
In the Treaty of Oliva, the Polish King, John II Casimir, renounced his claims to the Swedish crown, which his father Sigismund III Vasa had lost in 1599. Poland formally ceded Swedish Livonia and the city of Riga, which had been under de facto Swedish control since the 1620s. The signing of the treaty ended Swedish involvement in the Deluge.
1667.
The War for Ukraine ended with the Treaty of Andrusovo of January 13, 1667. The peace settlement gave Moscow control over the so-called Left-bank Ukraine with the Polish Commonwealth retaining Right-bank Ukraine. The signing of the Treaty ended Russian occupation of the Polish confederation and the Deluge war. Since the war started the population of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had been nearly halved by war and disease. War had destroyed the economic base of the cities and raised a religious fervour that ended Poland's policy of religious tolerance. 
1672.
As a result of the Polish–Ottoman War the Polish commonwealth ceded Podolia in the 1672 Treaty of Buczacz.
1686.
The Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686 was a treaty between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth signed on May 6, 1686, in Moscow. It confirmed the earlier Truce of Andrusovo of 1667. The treaty secured Russia's possession of the Left-bank Ukraine, Zaporozh'ye, Seversk lands, the cities of Chernihiv, Starodub, and Smolensk and its outskirts, while Poland retained Right-bank Ukraine.
1699.
The Treaty of Karlowitz, or Treaty of Karlovci, was signed on January 26, 1699, in Sremski Karlovci, a town in modern-day Serbia. The Treaty of Karlowitz was signed following a two-month congress between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League of 1684, a coalition of various European powers including the Habsburg Monarchy, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Republic of Venice, and the Russia of Peter I Alekseyevich. The treaty concluded the Austro-Ottoman War of 1683–1697, in which the Ottoman side had finally been defeated at the Battle of Senta. The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary, Transylvania, and Slavonia to Austria while Podolia returned to Poland. Most of Dalmatia passed to Venice, along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula) and Crete.
1772.
In February 1772, an agreement for the partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was signed in Vienna. Early in August Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves.
By the first partition in 1772, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about (30% of its territory, amounting at that time to about ), with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partition).
1793.
By the 1790s the First Polish Republic had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was successfully forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The alliance was cemented with the Polish–Prussian Pact of 1790. The conditions of the Pact were such that the succeeding and final two partitions of Poland were inevitable. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm.
Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of Poland's neighbours, wary of a potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. In the second partition, Russia and Prussia took so much territory that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland.
1795.
Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies, who fought to regain Polish territory, won some initial successes but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries.
1807.
Duchy of Warsaw.
Napoleon's attempts to build and expand his empire kept Europe at war for almost a decade and brought him into conflict with the same European powers that had beleaguered Poland in the last decades of the previous century. An alliance of convenience was the result of this situation. Volunteer Polish legions attached themselves to Bonaparte's armies, hoping that in return the emperor would allow an independent Poland to reappear out of his conquests.
The Duchy of Warsaw was a Polish state established by Napoleon in 1807 from the Polish lands ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia under the terms of the Treaties of Tilsit. The duchy was held in personal union by one of Napoleon's allies, King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony.
Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic).
Prussia had acquired the City of Danzig in the course of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. After the defeat of King Frederick William III of Prussia at the 1806 Battle of Jena–Auerstedt, according to the Franco-Prussian Treaty of Tilsit of 9 July 1807, the territory of the free state was carved out from lands that made up part of the West Prussia province.
1815.
Following Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia, the duchy was occupied by Prussian and Russian troops until 1815, when it was formally partitioned between the two countries at the Congress of Vienna.
Congress Poland.
Congress Poland was created out of the Duchy of Warsaw at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, when European states reorganized Europe following the Napoleonic wars.
Grand Duchy of Posen.
The Grand Duchy of Posen was a region in the Kingdom of Prussia in the Polish lands commonly known as "Greater Poland" between the years 1815–1848. According to the Congress of Vienna it was to have autonomy. In practice it was subordinated to Prussia and the proclaimed rights for Poles were not respected. The name was unofficially used afterwards for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to describe different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen (Polish: Poznań).
Free City of Kraków.
The Free, Independent, and Strictly Neutral City of Kraków with its Territory, more commonly known as either the Free City of Kraków or Republic of Kraków, was a city-state created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
1831.
After the November Uprising, Congress Poland lost its status as a sovereign state in 1831 and the administrative division of Congress Poland was reorganized. Russia issued an "organic decree" preserving the rights of individuals in Congress Poland but abolished the Sejm. This meant Poland was subject to rule by Russian military decree.
1846.
In the aftermath of the unsuccessful Kraków Uprising, the Free City of Kraków was annexed by the Austrian Empire.
1848.
After the defeat of Congress Poland, many Prussian liberals sympathised with the demand for the restoration of the Polish state. In the spring of 1848 the new liberal Prussian government allowed some autonomy to the Grand Duchy of Posen in the hope of contributing to the cause of a new Polish homeland."Many Prussian liberals sympathised with the demand for the restoration of the Polish state. Since the defeat of the uprising of the 1830-31 in Congress Poland ... In the spring of 1848 the new liberal Prussian government allowed some autonomy to Posen in the hope of contributing to the cause of restoration."</ref> Due to a number of factors, including the outrage of the German-speaking minority in Posen, the Prussian government reversed course. By April 1848, the Prussian army had already suppressed the Polish militias and National Committees that emerged in March. By the end of the year the Duchy had lost the last vestiges of its formal autonomy, and was downgraded to a Province of the Prussian kingdom."April 1848 ... the Prussian army had already suppressed the Duchy of Posen Polish militias and National Committee which had emerged in March. After 1848 Duchy of Posen lost the last vestiges of its formal autonomy, and was downgraded to a mere Provinz of the Prussian kingdom..."</ref>
1918.
The West Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed on November 1, 1918, with Lviv as its capital. The Republic claimed sovereignty over Eastern Galicia, including the Carpathians up to the city of Nowy Sącz in the west, as well as Volhynia, Carpathian Ruthenia and Bukovina. Although the majority of the population of the Western-Ukrainian People's Republic were Ukrainians, large parts of the claimed territory were considered Polish by the Poles. In Lviv the Ukrainian residents supported the proclamation, the city's significant Jewish minority accepted or remained neutral towards the Ukrainian proclamation, and the Polish majority was shocked to find themselves in a proclaimed Ukrainian state.
1919.
Creation of Poland.
In the aftermath of World War I, the Polish people broke out in the Greater Poland Uprising on December 27, 1918, in Poznań after a patriotic speech by Ignacy Paderewski, a famous Polish pianist. The fighting continued until June 28, 1919, when the Treaty of Versailles was signed, which recreated the nation of Poland. From the defeated German Empire, Poland received the following:
July 11, 1920, British anti-Polish decisions in the plebiscite in East Prussia (Powisle, Warmia, and Mazuria) during Soviet offensive towards Warsaw...
July 28, 1920, Allied ambassadors decision partitioning Cieszyn, Silesia, and leaving in Czechoslovakia a quarter of a million Poles in the strategic Moravian Gate...(leading to Poland from south-west)</ref>
Poland seizes West Ukrainian People's Republic.
On July 17, 1919, a ceasefire was signed in the Polish–Ukrainian War with the West Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR). As part of the agreement Poland kept ZUNR territory. The West Ukrainian People's Republic then merged with the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR). On June 25, 1919, Supreme Allies Council transferred East Galicia (ZUNR territory) to Poland.
Polish–Soviet War.
The Polish–Soviet War (February 1919–March 1921) was an armed conflict between Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine on the one hand and the Second Polish Republic and the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic on the other. The war was the result of conflicting expansionist ambitions. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established by the Treaty of Versailles following the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories it had lost at the time of the partitions. The aim of the Soviet states was to control those same territories, which the Russian Empire had gained in the partitions of Poland.
1920.
Free City of Danzig.
The Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk) was created on 15 November 1920 in accordance with the terms of Article 100 (Section XI of Part III) of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. As the Treaty stated, the region was to remain separated from Germany and from Poland, but it was not an independent state. The Free City was under League of Nations protection and put into a binding customs union with Poland.
Poland was given full rights to develop and maintain transportation, communication, and port facilities in the city. The Free City was created in order to give Poland access to a well-sized seaport.
Polish–Lithuanian War.
The Polish–Lithuanian War was an armed conflict between Lithuania and the Second Polish Republic, lasting from August 1920 to October 7, 1920, in the aftermath of World War I, not long after both countries had regained their independence. It was part of a wider conflict over disputed territorial control of the cities of Vilnius (), Suwałki and Augustów.
In the aftermath of the war the Republic of Central Lithuania was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division of the Polish Army, supported by the Polish air force, cavalry and artillery. Centered on the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilna (, ), for eighteen months the entity served as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. 
Negotiations with Russia.
Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the League of Nations, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on September 21 and the other on September 28. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on October 2. On the October 5, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. The armistice between Poland on the one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on October 12 and went into effect on October 18. Long negotiations ensued, with the Treaty of Riga being signed in March 1921. The assessment of relative advantage is not universally agreed.　Russian and Polish historians tend to assign victory to their respective countries. Outside assessments vary, mostly between calling the result a Polish victory and being inconclusive. However, in his secret report to the 9th Conference of the Bolshevik Party on 20 September 1920, Lenin called the outcome of the war "In a word, a gigantic, unheard-of defeat"
Negotiations with Czechoslovakia.
During the closing years of World War I Polish and Czechoslovakian diplomats met to arrange a common border between the two new countries. By the time armistice was declared, most of the border was agreed except for three small politically sensitive areas with both Polish and Czechoslovak residents.
The Cieszyn Silesia or the Duchy of Cieszyn ( and ) was a small area that the pre-World War I census showed was predominantly Polish in three districts (Teschen, Bielsko and Frysztat) and mainly Czech in the fourth district of Frydek. The economic importance of Cieszyn Silesia lay in the rich coal basin around Karvina and in the valuable Košice–Bohumín Railway, which linked Bohemia with Slovakia. In northern Cieszyn Silesia, the railroad junction of Bohumín ( and ) served as a crossroads for international transport and communications."Duchy of Cieszyn ( and ) was a small area ... on the eve of the First World War its population was predominantly Polish in three districts (Teschen, Bielsko and Frysztat) and mainly Czech in the fourth district of Frydek. The chief importance of Teschen lay in the rich coal basin around Karvina and in the ... valuable Bohumin-Kosice railroad, which linked Bohemia with Slovakia ... Furthermore the railroad junction of Bogumin (, ) served as a crossroad for international transport and communications."p. 158 - "According to it Teschen was divided along the Olza River, which left the railroad and the Karvina coal basin to Czechoslovakia ... "</ref>
Claims over these regions turned violent in 1919 with a brief military conflict, the Seven-day war, between Polish and Czechoslovak units. The Allied governments pressed for a ceasefire and on 3 February 1919 a Polish–Czech border agreement was signed on the basis of the 5 November 1918 ethnic division agreement. This was later changed at the Conference of Ambassadors in Spa, Belgium on 28 July 1920. Cieszyn () was divided along the Olza river between the two newly created states of Poland and Czechoslovakia. The smaller western suburbs of Cieszyn were joined to Czechoslovakia as the new town of Český Těšín along with the railroad and the Karvina coal basin.Cieszyn - "City on the border of Poland and Czechoslovakia , subject of a Polish–Czech conflict in 1919. The conflict was resolved by a decision of the Conference of Ambassadors (28 July 1920), which divided the city into a Polish part (Cieszyn) and a Czech part (Tesin). A treaty between Poland and Czechoslovakia on the community of Cieszyn was signed on 21 December 1920. The entire town was within the borders of Poland from 11 October 1938 to 1 September 1939 as a result of the Munich Agreement in 1938. After World War II the division of Cieszyn as of 1920 was restored."</ref> Poland received the portion of Cieszyn east of the Olza river. The Conference of Ambassadors divided the region just as the Red Army was nearing Warsaw. It was later learned that this award resulted from a secret deal between Edvard Beneš and French and British officials.
The county of Orawa () arose before the 15th century. The county's territory is situated along the Orava River between Zazriva and the Tatra Mountains. Spisz () is situated between the High Tatras and the Dunajec River in the north, the springs of the Váh River in the west, the Slovak Ore Mountains and the Hnilec River in the south, and a line running from the town of Stara Ľubovňa, via the Branisko Mountains, to the town of Margecany in the east. While the Orawa and Spisz border was in arbitration, many groups fought to be a part of Poland, including a number of Polish authors. They began to write about an alleged three hundred thousand Poles living in the Orawa territory.
The Conference of Ambassadors decided that Czechoslovakia would cede to Poland a number of villages from the Orawa and Spisz regions, including the municipalities of Oravy Srnie, Podvlk, Harkabúz, Nižná Zubrica, Vyšná Zubrica, Oravka, Bukovina-Podsklie, Pekelník, Jablonka, Chyžné, Hladovka, Suchá Hora, Vyšná Lipnica, a part of Nižné Lipnice and 4.2% of the rather Belá new communities, with Fridman (Falštin settlement), Krempach, Tribš, Durštín, Čierna Hora, Jurgov, Repiská, Vyšné lapse, Nižné lapse, Nedeca, Kacvín and Lapšanka.
1921.
In late 1921 a border adjustment between the Weimar Republic and Poland took place as a result of the Silesian Uprisings. The uprising were a series of three armed rebellions that took place between 1919 and 1921 by the Polish people in the Upper Silesia region against the Weimar Republic. The Polish people of the region wanted to join the Second Polish Republic, which had been established following World War I. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles had called for a plebiscite in Upper Silesia in 1921 to determine whether the territory should be a part of Germany or Poland.
The plebiscite took place on March 20, 1921, two days after the signing of the Treaty of Riga, which ended the Polish–Soviet War. In the plebiscite, 707,605 votes were cast for Germany, and 479,359 for Poland. The Germans had a majority, by 228,246 votes. In late April 1921, rumours flew that Upper Silesia would stay in Germany. This led to the Third Polish Uprising in May–July 1921. The question of the Upper Silesia problem was turned over to a council of the League of Nations. The commission, consisting of four representatives—one each from Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and China. The commission gathered its own data, interviewing Poles and Germans from the region. On the basis of the reports of this commission and those of its experts, on October 1921 the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland.
1922.
After a variety of delays, a disputed election to join Poland took place on January 8, 1922, and the Republic of Central Lithuania became part of Poland.
1924.
The Polish government was not satisfied with the Czechoslovakia-Polish border decided from the Paris Peace Conference or from the Conference of Ambassadors. The conflict was only resolved by the Council of the League of Nations' Permanent Court of International Justice on March 12, 1924, which decided that Czechoslovakia should retain the territory of Javorzyna.Javorzyna - "The dispute was submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice. On the basis of the court's decision, the League of Nations Council, on 12 March 1924, delimited the border, leaving Javorzyna within Czechoslovakia; this was recognized by both sides in a protocol signed on 6 May 1924 in Kraków and approved by the Conference of Ambassadors on 5 September 1924"</ref> and which entailed (in June of the same year) an additional exchange of territories in Orava - the territory around Lipnica Wielka (Nižná Lipnica) went to Poland, the territory around Suchá Hora (Sucha Gora) and Hladovka (Glodowka) went to Czechoslovakia. 
1938.
As Czechoslovakia was being absorbed into the German Reich, Zaolzie, the Czech half of Cieszyn, was annexed by Poland in 1938 following the Munich Agreement and the First Vienna Award. At noon on September 30, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czech troops and police from Zaolzie and gave Prague until noon the following day. At 11:45 a.m. on October 1 the Czech foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany – a charge that Warsaw was hard put to deny. 
Poland seized land from northern Spisz and northern Orawa, including territories around Suchá Hora and Hladovka, around Javorina, around Leśnica in the Pieniny Mountains, a small territory around Skalité, and some other very small border regions. They officially received the territories on 1 November 1938. Polish military groups began to carry out assimilation of the population. Polish was introduced as the only official language and the Slovak Intelligence were displaced from the territories.
1939.
World War II.
In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland and partitioned it pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
After the invasion, Germany annexed the lands it lost to reformed Poland in 1919–1922 by the Treaty of Versailles: the Polish Corridor, West Prussia, the Province of Posen, and parts of eastern Upper Silesia. The council of the Free City of Danzig voted to become a part of Germany again, although Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned. Parts of Poland that had not been part of Wilhelmine Germany were also incorporated into the Reich.
Two decrees by Adolf Hitler (October 8 and October 12, 1939) provided for the division of the annexed areas of Poland into the following administrative units:
These territories had an area of and a population of 10,000,000 people. The remaining Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone. Eastern areas of Poland became part of either Soviet Belarus (including Białystok, Łomża, Baranowicze and Brest) or Soviet Ukraine (including Lwów, Tarnopol, Lutsk, Rowne and Stanisławów). The city of Vilnius (Polish: "Wilno") with its adjacent area was annexed and returned to Lithuania.
After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the district of Białystok, which included the Białystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, Łomża, Sokółka, Volkovysk, and Grodno Counties, was "attached to" (not incorporated into) East Prussia. The former Lwow, Stanislawow and Tarnopol Voivoideships were annexed to the General Government, forming its fifth district, Distrikt Galizien.
1945.
On Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day: May 8, 1945) World War II Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany.
After World War II, there were extensive changes to the territorial extent of Poland, following the decision taken at the Teheran Conference of 1943 at the insistence of the Soviet Union. The Polish territories east of the Curzon Line, which the Soviet Union had occupied in 1939 along with the Bialystok region, were permanently annexed. While a large portion of this area was predominately populated by Ukrainians and Belarussians, most of their Polish inhabitants were expelled. Today these territories are part of Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania.
Poland received former German territory east of the Oder–Neisse line, consisting of the southern two thirds of East Prussia and most of Pomerania, Neumark (East Brandenburg), and Silesia. The German population was expelled and these territories were repopulated mainly with Poles from central Poland and those expelled from the eastern regions."From June until mid-July, Polish military and militia expelled nearly all of the residents of the districts immediately east of the rivers Oder-Neisse line""From June until mid July, Polish military and militia expelled nearly all people from the districts immediately east of the rivers Oder–Neisse line"</ref> Early expulsions in Poland were undertaken by the occupying Soviet and Polish Communist military authorities even before the Potsdam Conference ("wild expulsions").
Poland USSR.
On August 16, 1945, a border agreement between Poland and the USSR was signed. The western portion of the Byelorussian SSR was granted to Poland. The Belastok Voblast was divided into Soviet Brest Voblast, Hrodna Voblast and Polish Białystok Voivodeship.
As a result, Poland lost about 178,000 sq km of its pre-war territory in the east, but gained some 101,000 sq km in the west and north.
Czechoslovakia.
After World War II the Czechoslovakian government wanted to return to the 1920 border between the two nations, while Polish inhabitants of Zaolzie were in favour of the boundary of August 31, 1939. On May 20, 1945, in Trstena an agreement for a return to the 1938 borders of Poland was signed and the following day the Czechoslovak border guards moved to the old Czechoslovakian border. At several places there were fights between Polish and Czechoslovakian militias, but the situation calmed with the arrival of Polish troops on July 17, 1945. The Polish government still did not want to give up Zaolzie, and on June 16, 1945, Marshall Michał Rola-Żymierski issued directive number 00336, which ordered the 1st Armoured Corps of the Polish Army to concentrate in the area of Rybnik, and to seize Zaolzie. However, the Soviets decided to hand the region to Czechoslovakia, and the Poles followed the Moscow directive. The Czechs demanded former German areas of Klodzko, Glubczyce, and Racibórz, but after Soviet mediation, all sides signed a treaty on September 21, 1945, which accepted the December 31, 1937, Polish - Czechoslovak and Czechoslovak - German borderline as the boundary between the two countries.
1948.
The Polish border underwent a minor correction in 1948, when the village of Medyka near Przemyśl was transferred to Poland."warto dodac, ze w 1948 r. prezeprowadzono inna, mniej znana regulacje granicy, dzieki ktorej w polsce znalazla sie medyka, pierwotnie pozostawiona po stronie radzieckiej, oraz kilka wsi no pogorzu przemyskim - translation - In addition in 1948 there was a less well-known border adjustment, medyka and a few villages, which were originally left on the Soviet side."</ref>
1951.
On February 15, 1951 Aleksander Zawadzki, the president of the Polish Republic, and Andrey Vyshinsky, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signed "Treaty No. 6222. Agreement between the Polish republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics concerning the exchange of sectors of their state territories". The treaty was a border adjustment, with Poland and the Soviet Union exchanging .
1955.
In 1955 a small area of land on Usedom Island (Polish: Uznam) was ceded from the GDR (Eastern Germany) to Poland. The water pump station of Swinemünde lies on that land and was therefore handed over to Poland.
1958.
On June 13, 1958, the "Agreement concerning the final demarcation of the state frontier" between Czechoslovakia and Poland was signed in Warsaw. Adam Rapacki signed for Poland and Václav David signed for Czechoslovakia. The treaty confirmed the border at the line of January 1, 1938, the situation before the Nazi-imposed Munich Agreement transferred territory from Czechoslovakia to Poland.
1975.
In March 1975 Czechoslovakia and Poland modified their border along the Dunajec to permit Poland to construct a dam in the Czorsztyn region, southeast of Kraków.
2002.
In 2002, Poland and Slovakia made some further minor border adjustments:

Ninja Theory's second game, "Heavenly Sword", for the Sony PlayStation 3 was released in September 2007 and features a "free style" combat action system. The developer was nominated for five Develop Industry Excellence Awards for the game, including best new IP, visual arts, audio accomplishment, technical innovation, and best independent developer.
In June 2008, the company licenced NaturalMotion's morpheme animation system. Ninja Theory's third game, titled "", was released for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and was published by Namco Bandai Games. Previously, "Enslaved" was believed to be a sequel to "Heavenly Sword" until Ninja Theory confirmed otherwise; stating that such a game is "extremely unlikely".
At the Capcom Tokyo Games Show conference on September 15, 2010, it was announced that Ninja Theory were developing a reboot of the "Devil May Cry" franchise under the name of "". The game was released on January 15, 2013 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

The teased "Heavenly Sword 2" was cancelled for the time being. In June 2010, Ninja Theory expressed their interest in making another title and commented that they would have made a sequel had "Heavenly Sword" performed better in sales.
Before the multi-platform release of "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"; there were rumours claiming that the quality of the PS3 version was poor compared to the Xbox 360 version, Ninja Theory addressed these concerns by stating, "All formats are developed simultaneously so it wouldn’t be possible for one format to be cared for more than the other." In its technical analysis of the final release, Eurogamer's Digital Foundry team noted, "None of the disadvantages of either version are real game-breakers and overall either version is recommended, but if you own both consoles and have the choice of which version to buy, the Xbox 360 release is the one to get."

Copyright Royalty Board

The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) is a U.S. system of three copyright royalty judges who determine rates and terms for copyright statutory licenses and make determinations on distribution of statutory license royalties collected by the U.S. Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. The Board, made up of three permanent copyright royalty judges, was created under the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, which became effective on May 31, 2005, phasing out the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel system. These administrative judges are appointed by the Librarian of Congress. As of May 6, 2013, the board consists of Suzanne M. Barnett (Chief Copyright Royalty Judge), David R. Strickler (the economics judge), and Jesse Feder (the copyright judge).
May 2007 webcasting royalty increase.
On May 1, 2007, after 48 days of oral testimony (and 13 ,288 pages of written testimony), the Copyright Royalty Board set new rates for webcasting for the 2006–2010 License Period. The rates are higher than the then-existing royalties paid for non-interactive webcasting. One component of rate increase was to remove the cap on the per-station/channel minimum fee of $US500, which previously was $2,500.
The law requires rates to be based on the price that would be set by a marketplace of willing sellers and willing buyers. Much of the discussion centered around deciding issues like who would be the willing sellers. The Board decided that an individual record company was the basic unit of a "willing seller".
An issue that smaller webcasters raised was the desire to be assured that their fees would not exceed their revenue. The Board rejected this reasoning in their final decision because the ability of smaller stations to generate revenue from their operations has little or no bearing on the market value of the rights held by the copyright holders.
A coalition of webcasters that included National Public Radio (NPR) joined together to request a rehearing on the increase in rates. On April 16, 2007, the CRB rejected the appeal on the grounds that no new evidence was introduced.
License fee rates.
Commercial webcasters, per play, per listener rate
There is a minimum annual fee of $500 per channel or station, payable in advance, against the above per-play fees.
For example, under the 2007 rate, 100 unique listeners of a transmission of a sound recording will cost the transmitter eleven cents. The same 100 listeners previously cost a service a little over seven-and-a-half cents from 1998 through 2005. If a service plays an average of 15 songs an hour, and a listener listens for 9.1 hours a week (the average amount according to recent Bridge reports), the listener would cost the service $0.66 a month.
Noncommercial webcasters
Annual fee $500 per channel or station, up to a total of 159,140 aggregate tuning hours (ATH) per month. After this, the per-play rate for commercial webcasters applies. etc.

Mount Qasioun

Mount Qasioun (, transliterated as Jabal Qāsiyūn) is a mountain overlooking the city of Damascus, Syria. It has a range of restaurants, from which the whole city can be viewed. As the city has expanded over the years, some districts have been established on the foot of the mountain. Its highest point is .
The mountain has been heavily entrenched with Syrian regime armed forces since the start of the Syrian civil war.
Religious significance.
On the slopes of Jabal Qasiun is a cave steeped in legend. It is said to have been inhabited at one point by the first man Adam; and there are various stories told about Ibrāhīm (Abraham), and 'Īsā (Jesus) also having prayed in it. It is mentioned however in Medieval Arab history books as having been the place where Qābīl (Cain) killed Hābīl (Abel). It was known for hundreds of years as a place where prayers were immediately accepted, and especially in times of drought rulers of Damascus would climb to cave and pray for rain. Because of the murder that took place there, claimed to be the first murder ever in the world, it is called "Maghārat al-Dam" (the Cave of Blood). According to Sunni Muslims, Mount Qasioun is the site of the miḥrābs (prayer niches) of the 40 saints, known as the Abdāl, who are said to pray the night vigil prayers every night; a small mosque has been built over the 'Cave of Blood' containing these miḥrābs.
Further down the mountain from the 'Cave of Blood' there was another cave known as "Maghārat al-Jūˁ" (the Cave of Hunger). Stories about this cave are somewhat confused. Some say that forty saints dies there of hunger; al-Harawī, however, who lived in the 1200s AD, writes that it is said that forty prophets died there of hunger. Nowadays the cave has been concealed, surrounded by houses but that spot is called al-Juyūˁīyah (Roughly 'the Place of the Hungry').
On another flank of the same mountain is yet another cave, which has come down in local legend as being the cave of the Seven Sleepers, mentioned in early Christian sources, as well as in the Quran, where they are known as the "Aṣḥāb al-Kahf" (Companions of the Cave); this is rather dubious however, and it is only one of many caves in this part of the world that share the claim. These days a madressah has been built over the cave, but access is still given to pilgrims.

Byrdcliffe Colony

The Byrdcliffe Colony, also called the Byrdliffe Arts Colony or Byrdcliffe Historic District, was founded in 1902 near Woodstock, New York by Jane Byrd McCall and Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead and colleagues, Bolton Brown (artist) and Hervey White (writer). It is the oldest operating Arts and Crafts Colony in America. The Arts and Crafts Movement arose in the late nineteenth century in reaction to the dehumanizing monotony and standardization of industrial production. Byrdcliffe was created as an experiment in utopian living inspired by the arts and crafts movement. 
The colony is still in operation today and is located on with 35 original buildings, all designed in the Arts and Crafts style. There is a self-guided walking tour through the compound as well as a hiking path that leads to the mountain top which gives way to scenic Catskill views.
The colony continues to foster the development of artistic vision. Along with ongoing music, theater and art performances held in the Byrdcliffe Theater, Barn and on property lawns, The Byrdcliffe Colony hosts an Artist-In-Residence program that houses over 70 artists each summer who practice in a wide variety of field and medium. The program has most notably accepted writers, composers and visual artists.
Location.
Woodstock is surrounded by the Catskill Mountains of New York State. The entire Byrdcliffe estate lay on 1,500 acres (6 km²) of south-facing side of Mount Guardian, just above Woodstock. This location provides the rustic landscape meant to inspire and elevate the art community. Additionally, Woodstock offers a close proximity to the art and culture of New York City.
History.
For many years, Whitehead held the idea of creating an Arts and Crafts community where all the arts would come together, including painting, sculpture, music, metalwork and furniture making. After a failed attempt to establish a community near Arcadia, California and Albany, Oregon, he scouted the East Coast for a suitable site, eventually landing in Woodstock, NY. The Byrdcliffe Arts Colony received its name as a combination of Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead’s middle name and his wife’s, Jane Byrd McCall Whitehead, middle name. 
Artists, writers, musicians, social reformers, and intellectuals came from across the country to stay at Byrdcliffe and gain inspiration from the setting and people with shared artistic goals. Facilities included studios for painting, weaving, pottery, metalwork, woodworking; cottages with bathrooms and sleeping porches; a library, and a rambling villa for Whitehead and his family. He built "White Pines" as his residence with a skylit cathedral ceilinged weaving room overlooking a picturesque view across the Woodstock Valley.
The artist colony of Byrdcliffe failed to fulfill its goals of a self-sufficient arts community. It became too expensive and Ralph Whitehead’s dominating personality became a confining force. Byrdcliffe survived for almost 30 years under Whitehead’s vision until his death in 1929.
After Ralph Whitehead's death in 1929, his widow, Jane, and son Peter struggled to keep the colony alive. After Jane's death in 1955, Peter sold much of the land to pay taxes and maintenance on the heart of the colony which he kept intact. The Whiteheads intended to preserve Byrdcliffe "for the purpose of promoting among the residents of Woodstock...the study, practice and development of skill in the fine arts and crafts, as well as a true appreciation thereof..."
Although the arts and crafts utopian experiment soon ran out of steam, the continuing magic of Byrdcliffe enthralled many notable people including the educator John Dewey, author Thomas Mann and naturalist John Burroughs. Isadora Duncan danced at White Pines; Bob Dylan lived in a house at Byrdcliffe in the '60s and early '70s; Joanne Woodward was involved in the River Arts Repertory at the Byrdcliffe Theatre.
Artist In Residence Program.
The Artist in Residence program has operated at Byrdcliffe for approximately 20 years and now hosts over 75 artists of exceptional talent throughout four Summer sessions. Artists live together in two large communal buildings which helps to inspire and foster a creative community, as originally intended by the founders.There are numerous large work spaces and studios in multiple buildings on the property. The program sees an especially large influx of practicing visual artists, as well as published writers, college professors and professional composers, looking for retreat time to concentrate on their work. Facilities open for use by Byrdcliffe artists are a ceramics studio, jewelry making studio, woodworking studio and large performance spaces such at the Byrdcliffe Theater and the Barn.
Merger with Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen.
Upon Peter Whitehead's death in 1975, Byrdcliffe was left to the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen who have continued to maintain and administer programs at the colony. In 1979, the Byrdcliffe Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical and architectural significance. Byrdcliffe's cottages have been rented since 1984 only to working artists, maintaining sympathy with the founder's creative vision.
Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild.
Now owned by the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild (WBG), a non-profit arts and environmental organization with over 600 members, Byrdcliffe is the oldest continuing arts colony in America. The Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild is a multi-arts membership organization. Its Kleinert/James Arts Center hosts local and national performing, visual and literary artists. The WBG offers a variety of classes in the arts.
Byrdcliffe is an important regional example of the movement to create various types of utopian enclaves in America. Today, under the management and restoration efforts of the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild, Byrdcliffe continues as a place for artists to gain inspiration, live, and work.

Nowhere-zero flow

In graph theory, nowhere-zero flows are a special type of network flow which is related (by duality) to coloring planar graphs.
Definition.
Let "G" = "(V,E)" be a directed graph and let "M" be an abelian group. A map φ: "E" → "M" is a flow or an "M"-flow if for every vertex "v" ∈ "V", it holds that
where "δ+(v)" denotes the set of edges out of "v" and "δ–(v)" denotes the set of edges into "v".
Sometimes, this condition is referred to as Kirchhoff's law.
If "φ(e)" ≠ 0 for every "e" ∈ "E", we call φ a nowhere-zero flow. If "M" = Z is the group of integers under addition and "k" is a positive integer with the property that –"k" < "φ(e)" < "k" for every edge "e", then the "M"-flow φ is also called a "k"-flow.
Let "G" = "(V,E)" be an undirected graph. An orientation of "E" is a modular "k"-flow if
for every vertex "v" ∈ "V".
Properties.
Modify a nowhere-zero flow φ on a graph "G" by choosing an edge "e", reversing it, and then replacing "φ(e)" with "-φ(e)". After this adjustment, φ is still a nowhere-zero flow. Furthermore, if φ was originally a "k"-flow, then the resulting φ is also a "k"-flow. Thus, the existence of a nowhere-zero "M"-flow or a nowhere-zero "k"-flow is independent of the orientation of the graph. Thus, an undirected graph "G" is said to have a nowhere-zero "M"-flow or nowhere-zero "k"-flow if some (and thus every) orientation of "G" has such a flow.
More surprisingly, if "M" is a finite abelian group of size "k", then the number of a nowhere-zero "M"-flows in some graph does not depend on the structure of "M" but only on "k", the size of "M". Furthermore, the existence of a "M"-flow coincides with the existence of a "k"-flow. These two results were proved by Tutte in 1953.
Flow/coloring duality.
Let "G" = "(V,E)" be a directed bridgeless graph drawn in the plane, and assume that the regions of this drawing are properly "k"-colored with the colors {0, 1, 2, .., "k" – 1}. Now, construct a map φ: "E(G)" → {–("k" – 1), ..., –1, 0, 1, ..., "k" – 1} by the following rule: if the edge "e" has a region of color "x" to the left and a region of color "y" to the right, then let "φ(e)" = "x" – "y". It is an easy exercise to show that φ is a "k"-flow. Furthermore, since the regions were properly colored, φ is a nowhere-zero "k"-flow. It follows from this construction, that if "G" and "G*" are planar dual graphs and "G*" is "k"-colorable, then "G" has a nowhere-zero "k"-flow. Tutte proved that the converse of this statement is also true. Thus, for planar graphs, nowhere-zero flows are dual to colorings. Since nowhere-zero flows make sense for general graphs (not just graphs drawn in the plane), this study can be viewed as an extension of coloring theory for non-planar graphs.
Theory.
Just as no graph with a loop edge has a proper coloring, no graph with a bridge can have a nowhere-zero flow (in any group). It is easy to show that every graph without a bridge has a nowhere-zero Z-flow (a form of Robbins theorem), but interesting questions arise when trying to find nowhere-zero "k"-flows for small values of "k". Two nice theorems in this direction are Jaeger's 4-flow theorem (every 4-edge-connected graph has a nowhere-zero 4-flow) and Seymour's 6-flow theorem (every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 6-flow).
Tutte conjectured that every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 5-flow and that every bridgeless graph that does not have the Petersen graph as a minor has a nowhere-zero 4-flow. For cubic graphs with no Petersen minor, a 4-flow is known to exist as a consequence of the snark theorem but for arbitrary graphs these conjectures remain open.

Anarkali (1953 film)

Anarkali is a 1953 Hindi historical drama film directed by Nandlal Jaswantlal and based on the historical legend of the Mughal emperor Jahangir. As per the legend Jahangir revolted against his father Akbar over his love for a common girl called Anarkali.
It was the top grossing Hindi film in the year of its release, and one of the biggest Hindi film hits in its decade. Another film on the same theme was "Mughal-e-Azam", made in 1960, which was again a major commercial and critical hit.
Plot.
Shahenshah Jalaudin Akbar is the grandson of Babur, and the son of Humayun. He is known to have ruled over Hindustan with a humane and just heart. He knew in order to garner the support of the Hindus, he must treat them sensitively, allow them to worship freely, and in order to maintain this peace, he married Jodabai, a Hindu Rajput, the sister of Raja Man Singh. Through this marriage they became the proud parents of Shehzada Salim. Akbar first met Nadira in the Anar garden, while she was awaiting the arrival of her lover. So pleased he was with her that he wanted to reward her, but she only asked for an Anar, so he ended up bestowing her with the name of 'Anarkali'. He met her the second time when she was able to revive Salim, who was seriously wounded in a war in Kabul. Once again Akbar was pleased with her, wanted to reward her, but again she turned him down. The third time she ended up annoying Akbar when she sang and danced in his court under the influence of alcohol, and he has her imprisoned. The very foundations of Akbar's palace will be shaken to the roots, and his manner of meting out justice will be put to the extreme test, when he finds out that Salim is in love with Anarkali and wants to marry her. While Akbar may have been successful to end the strife between Hindus and Muslims, but will be able to break down the wall between the rich and the poor?

The Sidney Class consists of the original two ferries built for the British Columbia Ferry Corporation in 1960. The design for the ships was based on the MV "Coho" ferry with changes made to accommodate loading of vehicles through the bow of the vessel.
After more than 40 years of service, the "Queen of Sidney" (Hull 85) was retired on November 28, 2000. The "Queen of Tsawwassen" (Hull 309) continued in service until the fall of 2008. A decommissioning ceremony was held on September 27, 2008 at the Deas Pacific Marine shipyard.
These two ships spent almost all of their service life identical to when they were constructed, except for an expansion of the restaurant areas, due to unexpected food demand shortly after they commenced service.
The "Queen of Tsawwassen" was built at Burrard Dry Dock in Vancouver, while the "Queen of Sidney" was built at Victoria Machinery Depot in Victoria.
In popular culture.
The resting place of the Queen of Sidney, and the Queen of Tsawwassen, were used in the television show The Secret Circle as the location for a battle between the circle of witches and the witch hunters in the episode "Family."

<doc id="9910158" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9910158" title="State Records Authority of New South Wales">
State Records Authority of New South Wales

The State Records Authority of New South Wales (commonly known as State Records NSW) is the archives and records management authority of the Government of New South Wales in Australia. It can trace its history back to the establishment of the office of Colonial Secretary and Registrar of the Records of New South Wales in 1821. However, in the early years of the Colony's history, little attention was paid to the management and preservation of non-current public records. This was mainly because the government of the day was fully focussed on the administration of the convict system, law and order, immigration and land settlement. Documents which were not required for the day to day running of the government were usually neglected or were destroyed.
Background.
It was not until the late nineteenth century, with the approach of the Centenary of the Colony, that an awareness of the value of public archives as fundamental sources for Australian history was recorded. This interest led to the appointment of an Archivist of New South Wales, and the publication of Historical Records of New South Wales. At the time the term 'archives' was used broadly to include manuscripts, pictorial material and maps from a wide range of private sources as well as to denote non current official records.
The Trustees of the Public Library of New South Wales were active from about 1870 in the preservation of books and manuscripts relating to Australia, but it was the opening of the Mitchell Library in 1910 that provided the first real stimulus to action in the area of public records. At the request of the acting Premier and the Attorney General, The Trustees of the Public Library prepared a report on the present and future dangers of the neglect of State records, which included recommendations on the establishment of an Archives Department in the Public Library Building.
This proposal lapsed but during the period 1911-1918, some action was taken towards establishing an archives office. A number of instructions were issued by both the Premier and the Public Service Board, advising departments to transfer non current records considered to be of historical value, to the Mitchell Library. On the authority of these instructions, the Trustees of the Public Library became in effect, the archival authority for the State, and much work was done in the Mitchell Library to collect and preserve NSW State archives.
In November 1953 an Archives Department was established within the Public Library of New South Wales (subsequently State Library of New South Wales) by which time there was an estimated 2,300 metres of archives in the custody of the Mitchell Library.
The Archives Department in the period following 1953 adapted and put into practice recognised archival principles and procedures, both in the management of State archives in the custody of the Trustees and in the management of the Government Records Repository, which was established in 1955. The management of the repository was overseen by the Public Service Board.
The foundations for establishing a statutory authority to administer official archives in New South Wales had been well laid by the mid 1950s and preparatory work on Archives legislation began in 1955.
Archives Act 1960.
In September 1960, the Archives Bill was approved by Cabinet. It as introduced into the Legislative Assembly in October and in November the "Archives Act, No 46 of 1960", received Royal Assent. The Act was proclaimed to commence of the first day of June 1961. A new era in the management of public records in New South Wales had begun.
The Act stated that the "Archives Authority of New South Wales shall undertake the preservation, storage and arrangement, repair, cataloguing and calendaring, and have the custody and control, of the State archives and shall have the management of the Archives Office of New South Wales". The Archives Authority was also made responsible for the management of the New South Wales Government Records Repository and the Records Management Office of New South Wales.
Archives Authority.
The Archives Authority consisted of nine members, appointed by the Governor of New South Wales from the judiciary, legislature, universities and the New South Wales Public Service. The first Chairman of the Authority was Dr H.S. Wyndham CBE, MA, Ed D. Dip Ed and the Principal Archivist was Gordon D. Richardson. The work of the Authority mainly related to the examination of recommendations for the retention and disposal of public records.
Archives and Records Management Offices.
The Archives Office was housed in extensions to the Public Library of New South Wales, which had been commenced in 1959 and included three floors specifically designed to accommodate the new office. In 1976 the Archives Office became administratively separate from the Public Library of New South Wales and in late 1978 moved, with the Records Management Office to a new purpose built archives Building at 2 Globe Street, The Rocks.
Challenges for the Archives Office of New South Wales.
In the 1980s challenges facing the Archives Office were primarily related to the burgeoning interest in family history which reached a peak in 1988 and has never subsided. During this period there was a massive increase in the use of the archives and staff had to be reallocated to public areas to deal with the demand. The response to this almost overwhelming increase in the use of archival resources led to the establishment of a "Genealogical Research Kit" consisting of some of the more popular archives available to researchers. This was purchased by many libraries around NSW and reduced the demand on original documents.
Government Records Repository.
In 1987 an extension to the Government Records Repository at Kingswood was completed. This included a public reading room, an exhibition area and conference facilities as well as specialised storage. At this time the reading room could accommodate up to fifty people and many of the key documents were available to users on microfilm, with the originals in storage at Globe Street, The Rocks.
Regional Repositories.
Initially the concept of Regional Repositories started as an "archives on loan" scheme to place records which had been created in country areas, close to the originating community. The early 1980s saw a move to place archives at the University of New England, University of Newcastle, University of Wollongong, Riverina Murray Institute of Higher Education (now Charles Sturt University) and Newcastle Region Library. Archives were loaned to these institutions on the condition that they be properly looked after and made available to the local community for research. The regional repositories, with the addition of Broken Hill have grown into an informal network of archives in New South Wales that by 2005 contained a total of 4% of the State’s archival holdings.
State Records Act 1998.
The most significant event in the 1990s for the management of archives and government records in New South Wales was the advent of the State Records Act in 1998. Not only did this mean a change of name for the organisation, but also meant a change of direction and additional responsibilities.
For many years it had been realised by the Archives Office of NSW that the focus of the Archives Act 1960 was almost exclusively on archives, rather than on the full life cycle of government records from their inception to their archiving or destruction, the so called records continuum. To address these issues the new legislation took into account the need for mandating the creation and capture of records, the creation of standards and guidelines, protection of records, recovery of archival "estrays" and public access to records over 30 years old. The span of control of the act also brought local councils, universities and area health services under the umbrella of State Records which added significantly to the work load of the organisation.
Access to archives.
During the 1990s Genealogical Research Kits which contained microfilm copies of popular key archival documents were expanded, renamed Archives Resources Kits, and deposited at forty community access points, mainly public libraries, throughout New South Wales. This had the effect of reducing demand in the Reading Rooms at the Sydney Records and Western Sydney Records Centres. In addition to the Archives Resources Kits, work was going on behind the scenes to make more State archives available to external users electronically. In 2000 Archives Investigator was developed jointly by the State Records Authority of NSW and the Council of the City of Sydney. (The name refers to HMS "Investigator", in which Matthew Flinders completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, 1801-1803, and mapped much of the coast for the first time.) This made a large number of archival series available on line via the Internet. Work on Photo Investigator, a related database commenced in the early 2000s and by 2006 a considerable number of photographs from the archives were available to users online.
Expansion of Government Records Repository.
2005 saw the opening of the Stage 6 Building at the Government Records Repository at Kingswood by The Hon Bob Debus, Attorney General and Minister for the Arts. This building is a "state of the art" facility equipped with geothermal air conditioning, high thermal mass insulation and an argon gas fire suppression system. In 2005 it was estimated that this building would fulfil the storage requirements of the NSW government for non current records until 2011.

<doc id="9910191" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9910191" title="Cinema International Corporation">
Cinema International Corporation

Cinema International Corporation (CIC) was a film distribution company started by Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios in the early 1970s to distribute the 2 studios' films outside the United States – it even operated in Canada before it was considered part of the "domestic" market.
Overview.
On April 9, 1970, as a part of a cost-cutting move, caused due to declining movie-going audiences, and due to anti-trust rules, Paramount and Universal, merged their international distribution arms, into a new releasing company, Cinema International Corporation (CIC), registered in England and Wales.
In 1973, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer closed down its distribution offices and became a partner in CIC, which took over international distribution for MGM's films; however, United Artists took over the domestic distribution for MGM's films at that time. CIC also entered the home video market by forming CIC Video, which distributed Paramount and Universal titles on video worldwide. MGM however, had its own video unit, which later became a joint venture with CBS as MGM/CBS Home Video (later known as MGM/UA Home Video, which then became managed by Warner Home Video).
In 1981, MGM purchased United Artists, which had its own international distribution unit. CIC refused to let MGM drop out of the venture at the time, which led to the reorganization of the company as United International Pictures.
CIC's name lived on in its video division, which became directly managed as a joint venture of Paramount Home Video and MCA Videocassette, Inc. (later MCA Home Video and MCA/Universal Home Video). CIC Video survived until the late 1990s/early 2000s, when Universal purchased PolyGram and reorganized its video division (which was a joint venture with what is now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and remains so to this day) under the Universal name, while Paramount took over full ownership of CIC Video and merged it under its own video division.
Australia.
Early on, CIC operated the same as in other countries with distribution of Paramount, Universal, and MGM titles in Australia. In the mid 70s, CIC merged its units with 20th Century Fox's Australian distribution arm to form a joint venture, known as CIC-Fox. CIC/Fox distributed titles by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Universal, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Walt Disney Productions. In 1982, after the reformation of Cinema International Corporation as United International Pictures, the venture was renamed UIP-Fox and began to distribute United Artists titles (due to the merger with MGM a year earlier). The venture was ended in 1986, after Rupert Murdoch purchased Fox and Village Roadshow. Murdoch reorganized and obtained the Fox Australian distribution arm from UIP, and Disney sent its distribution under Village Roadshow. Theatrical releases from Paramount, Universal, MGM, & UA still continued under UIPs distribution arm, and the CIC-Fox video arm was renamed "CIC-Taft" for releasing titles from Paramount and Universal, along with Hanna Barbara and Taft Pictures titles, hence the Taft name because the latter company owned the former at that time (MGM/UA, Disney, and Fox had their own home video divisions at this point).
Controversy.
CIC made headlines in 2012 because both Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures deny ownership of director William Friedkin's third film, "Sorcerer." The studios claim they transferred ownership to CIC, which later dissolved, causing the rights to be in limbo. In April 2012, Friedkin sued the studios to discover who owns the domestic theatrical rights and to capture any royalty payments from VHS and DVD releases. At one point, a court date for March 2013 has been set if the parties could not reach a settlement. However, it was exactly that month that Friedkin revealed that he dropped his lawsuit against Universal and Paramount, and that he and a "major studio" are involved in the creation of a new, recolored digital print of "Sorcerer", to be screened at the Venice Film Festival and to receive a Blu-Ray release:

Julia Cornelia Paula

Julia Cornelia Paula or Julia Paula was a distinguished Roman noblewoman who became Empress of Rome as the first wife of the Roman emperor Elagabalus.
Family.
Julia Cornelia Paula was Empress of Rome from 219-220.Cornelia Paula was a member of the gens Cornelia through her maternal line. Her father, Julius Paulus, was a Roman Nobleman of Greek descent and a historically noted jurist active throughout the Severan Dynasty becoming a praetorian prefect in Rome. She was thus of both Patrician Roman and Greek descent and as such was a scion of the established upper Roman aristocracy.
In early 219, Julia Maesa, eldest sister of Roman Empress Julia Domna, arranged for Cornelia Paula to marry her grandson, the new emperor Elagabalus. Their wedding was lavishly celebrated in Rome. Cornelia Paula became Elagabalus' first wife and was given the honorific title of "Augusta" and the family name "Julia".
In late 220, Elagabalus divorced Julia Cornelia Paula to marry the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa in a union that was considered scandalous because she was still a Vestal. Apart from falling in love with Severa, Elagabalus married Severa as a part of the religious process of worshiping the Syrian Sun God El-Gabal and integrating El-Gabal into Roman religion.
After the divorce, Elagabalus removed Paula's Augusta title. As they had no children, she withdrew from public life and her fate afterwards is unknown.

McLaren MP4/7A

The McLaren MP4/7A was McLaren International's Formula One entry for the season, and a follow-up to their successful MP4/6 from . The Williams-Renault combination was getting faster and more reliable, and became a formidable challenger to McLaren's dominance. McLaren used the MP4/6 chassis, designated MP4/6B for the slightly modified Honda RA122E engine, for the first two races of 1992. The all-new MP4/7A was expected for the Spanish Grand Prix, the fourth race of the year. Due to Williams' speed in pre-season testing, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis made the decision to bring the car out one race early, at the Brazilian Grand Prix. However, this was one month earlier than expected.
This was the first McLaren to use a semi-automatic transmission; it was a McLaren-designed electro-hydraulic unit with semi-automatic activation. The team's technology partner Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG) helped with development. This system allowed the driver to keep his foot on the pedal, without lifting from it, since the throttle cable was replaced with an electronic sensor. It also controlled engine speed automatically during gear changes.
A variant of the car, dubbed MP4/7B, featuring an experimental active suspension system, was introduced in testing for that year's Portuguese Grand Prix. It proved insufficiently reliable, and was not used for the remainder of the 1992 season.
Success.
For the first time since , McLaren failed to capture the Constructors' or Drivers' Championship title. It was therefore the first time the team had failed to win the championships with Honda power, as the years to had all been successful in this respect. However, five Grand Prix victories were recorded by the drivers: three for Ayrton Senna, in his fifth season for the team, and two for Gerhard Berger in his third and final season for McLaren before switching back to Ferrari for 1993.
