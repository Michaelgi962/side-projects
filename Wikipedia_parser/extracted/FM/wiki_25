Cure monitoring

Real-time computing of cure monitoring is an essential component for the control of the manufacturing process of composite materials. The rationale for cure monitoring relies on the various physical or chemical properties that can be used to follow the transformation of an initially liquid thermoset resin into its final rigid solid form (curing). The relationship between the monitoring output and the requirements for feedback-loop control is the subject of extended research activities including considerations of the modelling of the cure reaction.

The group's first single, "If You Feel My Love" became quickly very popular in Romania.The second great hit is called "Dear Mama". The clip was internationally released in the beginning of March, as a present for the women and mothers all around the world. The first album of the group was released in December 2008. They appeared in the semifinals of the 2008 Golden Stag Festival and were among the finalists for the 2009 Romanian Eurovision Song Contest, with the song Dear Mama finishing in a tie for second place.
They planned to compete in the national selection of Romania for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song ""Save The World"" but later withdrew.
On the 2008 Golden Stag Festival, Blaxy Girls release a mixed edition of "If You Feel My Love". It is a special combined pop, R&B and Peking Opera style, English and Chinese language.This song is also highly recommended by Chinese music fans.
In late 2010 was announced that Blaxy Girls had passed the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 Romanian pre-selection and they are to compete in the National Final, held on New Year's Eve, with their entry "It's So Fine". They lost the competition once again. In 2011, they also released the single "Mr & Mrs President", a bilingual pop ballad. It was extremely well received by music critics and by the audience, but it didn't manage to enter any official chart in Romania, except the Romanian Digital Chart, where it peaked at number twenty-seven. After an eight months hiatus, the band released another single in Romanian, entitled "Mi-e dor" ("I miss"), another commercial failure. Their sophomore release has been delayed over ten times and it is still uncertain if it will ever be released.In 2013 they released the single called "Ma Mut La Mare"(I'm Moving To The Sea).

World Blood Donor Day

Every year, on 14 June, countries around the world celebrate World Blood Donor Day (WBDD). The event, established in 2004, serves to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products and to thank blood donors for their voluntary life-saving gifts of blood.
World Blood Donor Day is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Tuberculosis Day, World Immunization Week, World Malaria Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Hepatitis Day, and World AIDS Day.
Background.
Transfusion of blood and blood products helps save millions of lives every year. It can help patients suffering from life-threatening conditions live longer and with higher quality of life, and supports complex medical and surgical procedures. It also has an essential, life-saving role in maternal and perinatal care. Access to safe and sufficient blood and blood products can help reduce rates of death and disability due to severe bleeding during delivery and after childbirth.
In many countries, there is not an adequate supply of safe blood, and blood services face the challenge of making sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and safety.
An adequate supply can only be assured through regular donations by voluntary unpaid blood donors. WHO’s goal is for all countries to obtain all their blood supplies from voluntary unpaid donors by 2020. In 2014, 60 countries have their national blood supplies based on 99-100% voluntary unpaid blood donations, with 73 countries still largely dependent on family donors and paid donors.
Themes of World Blood Donor Day campaigns.
2014: Safe blood for saving mothers..
The focus of the WBDD 2014 campaign, marked on 14 June 2014, is “Safe blood for saving mothers”. The goal of the campaign is to increase awareness about why timely access to safe blood and blood products is essential for all countries as part of a comprehensive approach to prevent maternal deaths.
According to the World Health Organization, 800 women die every day from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications. Severe bleeding is the cause of 34% of maternal deaths in Africa, 31% in Asia and 21% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The global host for the WBDD 2014 event is Sri Lanka. Through its national blood transfusion service, Sri Lanka has been promoting voluntary unpaid donation to increase access to safe and sufficient blood and blood products.so creating awareness among people.
2013: Give the gift of life..
The focus for th WBDD 2013 campaign – the 10th anniversary of World Blood Donor Day – was blood donation as a gift that saves lives. WHO encourages all countries to highlight stories from people whose lives have been saved through blood donation, as a way of motivating regular blood donors to continue giving blood and people in good health who have never given blood, particularly young people, to begin doing so.
The host country for World Blood Donor Day 2013 was France. Through its national blood service, the Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS), France has been promoting voluntary non remunerated blood donation since the 1950s.
2012: Every blood donor is a hero..
It focuses on the idea that every one of us can become a hero by giving blood.
Blood cannot be manufactured artificially & so people must donate blood,
so it can be available when needed for patients.
Many silent blood donors save lives every day through their blood donations.

Rudolf Roy

Rudolf Roy Jr. (15 August 1920 – 17 December 1944) was a Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) in the Waffen SS during World War II, awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Rudolf Roy Jr. was born on 15 August 1920 in Spandau, Berlin and was named after his bricklayer father. He attended the local elementary school and at the age of 13 joined the Hitler Youth. In April 1934, he joined the Landwehr (Militia) and was stationed in East Prussia until December 1934. He was then trained as a machine locksmith and became skilled in his trade. In November 1938, at the age of 18, he volunteered to join the Allgemeine-SS.
World War II.
In 1940, Roy was assigned to 1st Company, Training and Reserve Battalion, Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler for basic military training and then assigned to the 3rd Battery, 1st SS Panzerjäger (Tank Hunter) Battalion. He took part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, in 1941 and was awarded the Iron Cross (2nd class).
Roy was promoted to Unterscharführer (Sergeant) in January 1943 and transferred to the 1st Battery, then under the command of Karl Heinz Prinz. He was awarded the Iron Cross (1st class) in September.
In April 1944, the entire Panzerjäger Battalion was transferred to the newly formed 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend". It was classed as unfit for combat when the Allies landed in Normandy on 6 June as it was still forming, so it did not reach the front until July at which time Roy was promoted to Oberscharführer (Technical Sergeant).
The 12th SS Panzerjäger Battalion was quickly sent into action and credited with being largely responsible for the defeat of the Allied Operation Totalise over the period 8 to 10 August. Roy and his gunner, Fritz Eckstein, were credited with destroying eight tanks on 8 August and the next day knocked out a further 13 tanks. Within five days, the duo had knocked out a total of 26 tanks, which brought his total up to 36 tanks destroyed.
Roy's efforts resulted in an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. His citation for the Knight's Cross reads:
The dawn of 9.8.1944, enemy tanks penetrated into the rear of Kampfgruppe Waldmüller through the gaps in the HKL near Soignolles, dominating all supply lines from Hill 111. Oberscharführer Roy was ordered to attack and destroy the enemy tanks with his Panzerjäger 39. Roy crept up on the tanks with courage and mobility, and within short time knocked out 8 English tanks. By doing so he created the prerequisite for the withdrawal ordered that evening. At 21:30, because of the constantly increasing enemy fire, the Kampfgruppe began its disengagement as commanded. In the middle of the withdrawal enemy tanks launched a surprise attack on the Kampfgruppe in the village of Soignolles. In an independent decision Oberscharführer Roy attacked the tanks in the flank. Of the 15 attacking enemy tanks only 2 were able to escape. Oberscharführer Roy destroyed 13 tanks on this day, within 5 days 26, and increased his total number of knocked out English and Russian tanks to 36.
Roy did not survive the war but was killed during the Battle of the Bulge. On 17 December 1944, while attacking the lines of the US 99th Infantry Divisions, he was killed by a sniper while looking out of his tank's hatch. Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant) Helmut Zeiner reported:We followed a narrow, occasionally winding forest lane to a spot where it split and dropped off. There, all hell broke loose. The enemy had armor-piercing weapons, snipers in the trees, and a few Shermans in ambush position. Oberscharführer Roy, who had taken over 1. platoon in my place, was driving behind me. He was killed by a shot to the head.
Roy was posthumously promoted to Untersturmführer and is buried in the war cemetery in Bonn - Bad Godesberg Germany, grave number 756.

Eclectic paradigm

The eclectic paradigm is a theory in economics and is also known as the OLI-Model or OLI-Framework. It is a further development of the internalization theory and published by John H. Dunning in 1980.
Internalization theory itself is based on the transaction cost theory. This theory says that transactions are made within an institution if the transaction costs on the free market are higher than the internal costs. This process is called "internalization".
For Dunning, not only the structure of organization is important. He added 3 more factors to the theory:
Theory.
The idea behind the Eclectic Paradigm is to merge several isolated theories of international economics in one approach. Three basic forms of international activities of companies can be distinguished: Export, FDI and Licensing. The so-called OLI-factors are three categories of advantages, namely the "ownership advantages", "locational advantages" and "internalization advantages". A precondition for international activities of a company are the availability of "net ownership advantages". These advantages can both be material and immaterial. The term "net ownership advantages" is used to express the advantages that a company has in foreign and unknown markets.
According to Dunning two different types of FDI can be distinguished. While "resource seeking investments" are made in order to establish access to basic material like raw materials or other input factors, "market seeking investments" are made to enter an existing market or establish a new market. A closer distinction is made by Dunning with the terms "efficiency seeking investments", "strategic seeking investments" and "support investments".
The eclectic paradigm also contrasts a country's resource endowment and geographical position (providing "locational" advantages) with firms resources ("ownership" advantages). In the model, countries can be shown to face one of the four outcomes shown in the figure above.
In the top, right hand box in the figure above firms possess competitive advantages, but the home domicile has higher factors and transport costs than foreign locations. The firms therefore make a FDI abroad in order to capture the rents from their advantages. But if the country has locational advantages, strong local firms are more likely to emphasize exporting. The possibilities when the nation has only weak firms, as in most developing countries, leads to the opposite outcomes. These conditions are similar to those suggested by Porter's diamond model of national competitiveness.
Application in practice.
In dependence of the categories of advantage there can be chosen the form of the international activity. If a company has "ownership advantages" like having knowledge about the target market abroad, for example staff with language skills, information about import permissions, appropriate products, contacts and so on, it can do a licensing. The licensing is less cost-intensive than the other forms of internalization.
If there are internalization advantages, the company can invest more capital abroad. This can be achieved by export in form of an export subsidiary.
The FDI is the most capital intensive activity that a company can choose. According to Dunning, it is considered that "locational advantages" are necessary for FDI. This can be realized by factories which are either bought or completely constructed abroad. FDI is the most capital intensive form of internalization activity.

I98FM

"i98fm" is a commercial radio station broadcasting on the FM band to the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. It is owned by WIN Corporation, the parent company of WIN Television.
History.
The station was born as 2OO ("2 Double 0") on 1 January 1979, broadcasting on 1575 kHz on the AM band. It often rated well behind popular rival commercial station, 2WL (now Wave FM), who had been broadcasting in the region since 1931. On 25 June 1992, 2OO converted to FM broadcasting and was relaunched as i98fm.
Since 1995, i98fm has consistently been the #1 radio station in the region (with the exception being two consecutive surveys in late 2002 and early 2003, when its main commercial rival, Wave FM, was the #1 station).
The station was broadcasting its own live coverage of Illawarra Steelers matches since the team's inception into the NSWRL competition in 1982. After the team merged with the St. George Dragons during the 1998/99 off-season, the station continued to broadcast their own live coverage of St. George Illawarra Dragons matches until 2001. In 2002, the live Dragons matches was axed in favour of the "Continuous Call Team" on relay from Sydney station 2GB, which aired on Sunday afternoons. That move contributed to i98fm's loss of the #1 position to Wave FM.
Notable on-air teams on i98FM over the years have included: Maroon & Milly (Breakfast), Marty & Erica (Breakfast), Marty, Erica & Stretto (Breakfast), Ryan Cram & Matt Smith ("The Shift" - night program), Marty & Bianca (Breakfast), Maje & Fairlie (The Backseat - Drive program).
From October 2008 and into 2009, some big on-air changes happened at i98FM. Bianca Dye joined the Breakfast Show replacing Erica Hodge and Maje Saba and Fairlie Hamilton formed the first male/female duo team in Drive, called "The Backseat". Ryan Cram moved from nights to Afternoons and Glenn "Stolzy" Stolzenhein moved from sister station C91.3FM nights to i98's night program, called "After Hours". A weekend spot program called "Game On" was created and was hosted (until early 2012) by Tim "Robbo" Robinson.
From October 2008, i98FM began broadcasting programs that could also be heard on its Campbelltown sister station, C91.3. Ryan Cram's afternoon shift, along with networking 'The Backseat' and 'After Hours' between both stations. This arrangement was mostly discontinued from January 2010, with "After Hours" the only i98fm program to be networked to C91.3 on weekdays. From 2011, i98 stopped broadcasting programs to C91.3FM.
2012 saw the first major on-air changes to i98FM's lineup in 2-3 years. Fairlie Hamilton left "The Backseat" program, Lyndal Rodgers took up the "After Hours" program after 6pm at night and Paul Glover took over the "Game On" sports program on weekends. In 2013, Simon Anderson replaced Paul Glover as "Game On" host. Currently as of 2014, the show has various hosts.
In November 2012, i98's major charity event, the annual "Camp Quality Convoy" raised over 1 million dollars for Camp Quality charities in the Illawarra. In November 2013, a further 1.1 million dollars was raised by the annual event.

Malta Philharmonic Orchestra

The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra (Maltese: Orkestra Filarmonika Nazzjonali) is the national symphony orchestra of Malta. It was founded in 1968 and was originally known as the Manoel Theatre Orchestra, where it was in residence for both opera productions and orchestral concerts. In September 1997 the orchestra became an independent body and was officially named as Malta's national orchestra. Its current Music Director is Michael Laus. 
History.
The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra was founded on April 1, 1968 and was originally known as the Manoel Theatre Orchestra. It was composed of a number of musicians who had previously formed part of a chamber orchestra in the employment of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy (Malta), better known as the C-in-C Orchestra that had been disbanded one day earlier. As the orchestra in residence at the Manoel Theatre, it regularly performed operas and symphonic concerts under the direction of its resident conductors Joseph Sammut (1968-1992) and Michael Laus (1992-1997).
In September 1997 the orchestra became an independent body and was officially named The National Orchestra of Malta. Its first resident conductor was Joseph Vella. Ten years later, in December 2007, the orchestra was expanded to a full-size symphony orchestra and performed for the first time as The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra on January 12, 2008 on the occasion of Malta's entry into the Eurozone.
Starting in January 2005, co-operation programmes with foreign orchestras were initiated. These have led to various learning and cultural exchanges with orchestras such as the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestra Sinfonica di Pesaro, Orchestra e Coro di Milano La Verdi, Orchestra e Conservatorio della Svizzera Italiana, and others.
The orchestra toured for the first time, in its previous form as a chamber orchestra, during the 2001-02 season. In Belgium the orchestra performed at the City Hall in Brussels under the direction of Michael Laus, who is still its resident conductor, while in Sicily it took part in a five-performance production of Mozart's "Così fan tutte" in Palermo. In June 2003, the National Orchestra participated in the production of Leonard Bernstein's "Candide" at Rome's Teatro Argentina, followed by a concert in the ruins of the Villa Adriana in Tivoli. Further concert tours followed, namely, a joint venture with the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra in Brno in 2006, in Pesaro in 2007, and in Lugano and Zaragoza in 2008.
Activities.
The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra has performed with distinguished conductors and musicians in both concerts and operas. Soloists who have performed with the orchestra include Cecilia Gasdia, Ghena Dimitrova, Miriam Gauci, Joseph Calleja, Andrea Bocelli, José Carreras, Kate Aldrich, Daniela Dessi, and Lydia Caruana. It is also a leading exponent of Maltese composers with the ambition to promote Maltese compositions and to make them known to a wider international audience. The orchestra's extensive calendar of events consists mainly of symphonic concerts at the Manoel Theatre, the Mediterranean Conference Centre and other venues, as well as opera productions in Malta and Gozo and abroad. The orchestra also ventures into the light popular repertoire with dedicated concerts scheduled during the spring/summer months. It has education programmes for children, involving them in workshops and creative talks on topics that cover the whole spectrum of music-making.

Luigi Ossoinack (1849–1904). Born in Fiume, studied in Ljubljana, Graz and Vienna, where he graduates at the commercial academy. He practised trade in Trieste, Odessa, London and “North America”.
In 1873 he came back to Fiume, where he starts his own maritime agency. His businesses expand uninterruptedly: in 1877 he opens the first regular line between Fiume and Liverpool, and had direct influence on the institution of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria",(1881). On his initiative the Magazzini Generali were opened in (1878), and he engaged also in industrial activities with the Rice mill in (1881), and an Oak Wine Barrels plant at Mlaka (1888), and the steam shipping company "Oriente" (1891), for trade with Asia. Luigi Ossoinack participated also in the first Hungarian oil refinery, established in Fiume in 1882, and was a company board member.
Luigi Ossoinack had a decisive influence on the political life in Fiume, being the principal financial supporter of the fiuman Autonomist Party. Both Autonomist Party leaders Michele Maylender and Riccardo Zanella were actually his employees.
In 1904, for unknown reasons, he committed suicide, leaving a vacuum in the political and economic life of the city, that was never healed again. His son Andrea Ossoinack, last deputy from Fiume at the Hungarian parliament, claimed for his city the right of national self-determination, at the end of World War I.

<doc id="21421210" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21421210" title="Signorelli parapraxis">
Signorelli parapraxis

The Signorelli parapraxis represents the first and best known example of a parapraxis and its analysis in Freud's "The Psychopathology of Everyday Life". The parapraxis centers on a word finding problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name (Signorelli) of the painter of the Orvieto frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters Botticelli and Boltraffio. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised, not only by linguists.
Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi.
One important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village Trafoi where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through Bosnia-Herzegowina.
The second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word "signor" from the forgotten name Signorelli. "Herr", the German counterpart of "Signor", is then linked to Herzegowina and the word "Herr" occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation. 
Freud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. Jacques Lacan suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting. 
Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream.
The first critique to Freud came from Emil Kraepelin, who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on language disturbances in dreams, relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism "Trafei", which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian "trofei" is associated to "Trafei" in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of "trofei" reads in German "Siegeszeichen" (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin "signum" clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p. 22-24).
Sebastiano Timpanaro.
In "The Freudian Slip" Sebastiano Timpanaro discusses Freud's analysis in chapter 6 "Love and Death at Orvieto." (p. 63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a mayor role during the parapraxis, as he states: "Boltraffio is a "Schlimbesserung" is a substitute worse than another substitute" and adds "the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault."(p. 71). He calls Botticelli an "involuntary banalization" and Boltraffio "a semi-conscious disimproved correction."(p. 75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: "The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of "signor" from Signorelli and of "Her(r)" from Herzegowina is another."
Swales' investigation.
Peter Swales (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in Bergamo mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name Da Vinci, another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on "Piazza della Scala" in Milan some days before his visit to Bergamo), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.
Freud neglected his own observation.
Freud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos (see: Fresco of the Deeds of the Antichrist). The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The "signature" can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb "signare" and this word, instead of Freud's "signore", then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p. 66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations ("Bo" and "Herr") Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's self-esteem). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis "during" Freud's trip from Ragusa to Trebinje (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales.

Tirthika

Tirthika (Sanskrit: tīrthika, Pali: titthiya, "ford-maker," meaning one who is attempting to cross the stream of samsara) is a general term referring to heretics, or non-Buddhists in general. In the Tipitaka the term may refer specifically to adherents of Jainism. Whereas a Buddhist takes refuge in the Three Jewels and treads the middle way between extremes, a Tirthika does not.
According to the "Asoka Avadhana", the Tithikas that were jealous of Asoka's preaching of Buddhism gathered together and said to each other, "Should this king Asoka continue a worshiper of Buddha, all other persons encouraged by him would likewise become followers of Buddha." They then went to people's houses and declared that their religion is the true religion and that Buddhism gives no Moksha.
Tirthika is associated with the word Tirthankara as used in Jainism.

Burke Ministry (Western Australia)

The Burke Ministry was the 29th Ministry of the Government of Western Australia, led by Labor Premier Brian Burke and deputy Mal Bryce. It commenced on 25 February 1983, six days after the O'Connor ministry, led by Premier Ray O'Connor of the Liberal Party, was defeated at the 1983 election. It was followed by the Dowding Ministry upon Burke's retirement as Premier on 25 February 1988. 
Most of its members followed on from the Burke shadow ministry which had functioned since September 1981.
Overview.
At first, the Burke Ministry utilised roles which were largely inherited from the previous Government. As the government had come to power at a time of economic recession, it commissioned a State Employment Task Force under the direction of Dr John Wood to review the machinery of government. An earlier report commissioned by the previous government on mining and resource development had highlighted interdepartmental conflicts in these areas. On the basis of these, a major reshuffle took place on 23 December with no changes of personnel, although several roles were abolished and new ones created, and Arthur Tonkin, who was said to have presented "too hardline an image" in his dealings with business, was relieved of Consumer Affairs. Another reshuffle occurred on 22 March 1985.
The Ministry was reconstituted on 26 February 1986 following the 1986 election, due in part to the defeat of one minister, Ken McIver (MLA for Avon), and the decisions of Ron Davies and David Evans to stand down. At this point, two honorary Ministers were appointed, including Ernie Bridge, to assist ministers in a number of portfolios. On 25 July 1986, they were both promoted to full Ministers, making Bridge the first ever Aboriginal Cabinet minister in Australia.
First Ministry.
On 25 February 1983, the Governor, Sir Richard Trowbridge, designated 15 principal executive offices of the Government under section 43(2) of the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899. The following ministers were then appointed to the positions, and served until the reconstitution of the Ministry on 26 February 1986.
The list below is ordered by decreasing seniority within the Cabinet, as indicated by the Government Gazette and the Hansard index.
Second Ministry.
On 26 February 1986, the Governor, Gordon Reid, appointed the new Ministry. He designated 15 principal executive offices of the Government and appointed the following ministers to the positions, who served until the Dowding Ministry was established on 26 February 1988. Three of the members were new to the Ministry, and two additional honorary members were also appointed to assist specific Ministers. One of these was Australia's first ever Aboriginal Cabinet minister, Ernie Bridge. These honorary ministers were elevated to ministerial posts following the assent of the Constitution Amendment Act 1986 (No.10 of 1986) on 22 July 1986, which officially grew the Ministry from 15 to 17 members.
The members of the Second Ministry were:

Between 1992 and 1994, Røberg Larsen was treasurer and youth secretary of the Oslo chapter of the Workers' Youth League (AUF). While the organization in reality had about 700 members, the local leaders of the organization had informed the municipal authorities that they had 1201 members, resulting in fraud of in 1992. Røberg-Larsen was the only board member of the organization that admitted to the facts of the false information. 
He was as well the only of the four prosecuted board members that assisted both the police and the municipal authorities by explaining what he had been involved in. 
His openness led to an ice front between him and the organization, and on 12 December 1996, he was excluded from AUF.
Røberg-Larsen is the sole shareholder of BJRL Media Ltd and own through the company more than 20 internet sites and runs affiliate marketing campaigns both in Norway and international. BJRL Media is a rapid growing company with a high focus on business ethics.

Technical University of Varna

The Technical University of Varna (, often abbreviated as ТУ – Варна, TU – Varna) is a state university in Varna, Bulgaria, founded in 1962.
History.
The Technical University of Varna was established in 1962 by the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria and the Decree of the National Assembly in order to ensure the training of engineering staff in the field of shipbuilding, transportation, mechanical engineering, electrical energetics and communication techniques necessary for developing industrial complexes in northeastern Bulgaria in the field of chemistry, shipbuilding and ship repairing, engine building, transportation, electric energetics, electronics and communications.
Additional information.
Initially, the University is established as the Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Institute (MEI – Varna) of three faculties: Machinery, Electrical and Shipbuilding. The first intake of students in MEI – Varna occurs in the 1963/64 school year on the following subjects: Internal-combustion Engines, Marine Equipment and machinery, Shipbuilding, Mechanical engineering technology, Electrical machinery and apparatus, Radio equipment, telecommunication engineering and telemechanics and Automation of production.
The creation of MEI – Varna is a great restoration of the Technical Department at the State University "St. Cyril Slavyanobulgarski" Varna, officially established on 18 August 1945. Technical Faculty had the following departments: Machinery, Shipbuilding, Electrical, Construction and Architectural and Industrial Chemistry. Because of the changes in social and political life in Bulgaria during this period, the Faculty as well as the University had undergone significant changes and the last shipbuilding engineers that were taught in the Technical Faculty graduated in 1958. The first professors in MEI – Varna are former professors from the Technical Faculty and its graduates therefore it is considered that MEI – Varna is the successor of the Technical Faculty at the Varna State University. During the years of its existence MEI – Varna a small institute preparing engineering staff of regional significance has become the Technical University of national importance, training students in 23 subjects. For 40-year period of activity of Technical University – Varna 28,976 professionals have graduated of higher education in the field of “Engineering Sciences”, “Science, Mathematics and Computer Science”, “Social, Economic and Legal Sciences” and “Pedagogical Sciences, Engineering and Technology Direction“. At present, Technical University – Varna has passive buildings with extended built-up area of 67,542 m2.

Pat's Uninteresting Tours

Pat's Uninteresting Tours was a series of themed route bus tours that offered an alternative to the usual sightseeing tours. Taking passengers on a four hour comedy excursion to downmarket locations it operated in Sydney, Australia during the mid to late 1980s. 
The premise was to conduct paying passengers on a bus and expose them to ordinary situations in incongruous contexts - actively avoiding normal tourist attractions and visiting uninteresting sites. These included wine tasting at a rubbish tip, "experiencing fresh air" at the sewage works and formal dinner at a road-side diner. Passengers were encouraged to dress in tourist garb for the day tours and tacky evening wear for night tours. After TV New Zealand program "That's Fairly Interesting" recorded a segment, tours were conducted in Wellington, Christchurch, Palmerston North and later Auckland. 
Beginnings.
Patrick McGeown created the concept in 1978 whilst serving on board the Royal Australian Navy warship HMAS "Perth". After repeated trips to Hawaii, he began to lead alternative sightseeing events for other crewmates. Following the inaugural tour he then conducted tours in Darwin and Canberra before launching the concept as a business in Sydney on 17 March 1985.
Destinations.
Each tour was unique and the four hours of improvisation and creativity took passengers to an assortment of locations.  Some Sydney locations were:

Limiting oxygen concentration

Limiting oxygen concentration, (LOC), also known as the Minimum oxygen concentration, (MOC), is defined as the limiting concentration of oxygen below which combustion is not possible, independent of the concentration of fuel. It is expressed in units of volume percent of oxygen. The LOC varies with pressure and temperature. It is also dependent on the type of inert (non-flammable) gas.
The effect of increasing the concentration of inert gas can be understood by viewing the inert as thermal ballast that quenches the flame temperature to a level below which the flame cannot exist. Carbon dioxide is therefore more effective than nitrogen due to its higher molar heat capacity
The concept has important practical use in fire safety engineering. For instance, to safely fill a new container or a pressure vessel with flammable gasses, the atmosphere of normal air (containing about 21 volume percent of oxygen) in the vessel would first be flushed (purged) with nitrogen or another non-flammable inert gas, thereby reducing the oxygen concentration inside the container. When the oxygen concentration is below the LOC, flammable gas can be safely admitted to the vessel because the possibility of internal explosion has been eliminated.
The limiting oxygen concentration is a necessary parameter when designing hypoxic air fire prevention systems.

Bicarbonate indicator

A bicarbonate indicator (hydrogencarbonate indicator) is a type of pH indicator that is sensitive enough to show a color change as the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in an aqueous solution increases. The indicator is used in photosynthesis and respiration experiments to find out whether carbon dioxide is being liberated. It is also used to test the carbon dioxide content during gaseous exchange of organisms. When the carbon dioxide content is higher than 0.03%, the initial red color changes to yellow as the pH becomes more acidic. If the carbon dioxide content is lower than 0.03%, it changes from red to purple. Carbon dioxide, even in the concentrations found in exhaled air, will dissolve in the indicator to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which will lower the pH and give the characteristic colour change. A colour change to purple during photosynthesis shows a reduction in the percentage of carbon dioxide and is sometimes inferred as production of oxygen, but is not actually direct evidence for it.
Great care must be taken to avoid acidic or alkaline contamination of the apparatus in such experiments, since the test is not directly specific to carbon dioxide.

Margo Davidson

Margo Isabella Davidson (September 28, 1957 – May 17, 2008) was a founding member of Parachute Club and an advocate for the homeless.
History.
Early background.
Davidson was born in Simcoe, Ontario and attended Simcoe Composite School where she developed her musical talent. Davidson's father died in 1971; she had one brother and two step-siblings. Her brother David, a trombonist, was also involved in music, as a high school music teacher and performer.
Davidson initially played both piano and saxophone, and was a member of the Simcoe Composite School band. She formed her first music group, a jazz quartet, while a high school student, and played semi-professionally in the Simcoe area.
Musician.
Davidson was a saxophonist, percussionist and vocalist with The Parachute Club during its entire recording career and period of its greatest international popularity (1982–1989). Following the initial breakup of the band Davidson, with the exception of the occasional guest performance (see below), chose to leave the music business entirely and spent the balance of her life working with organizations dedicated to assisting the homeless.
Davidson arrived in Toronto from Simcoe in 1975, following graduation from Simcoe Composite School. She briefly attended the University of Toronto, and commenced playing with local bands. With Toronto female singer Robin Wells, with whom Davidson had been associated in a previous band, Davidson co-founded The Wells-Davidson Band in 1978, playing rhythm and blues and rock music. The band was distinctive as being one of a minority of bands led by two women. At that time, and through the 1980s, Davidson was also notable as one of very few female saxophonists playing professionally, predating such artists as Candy Dulfer, Katja Rieckermann and Colleen Allen. In terms of the Toronto music scene of the late 1970s, she was a contemporary of Dianne Heatherington, with whom she played on occasion. Davidson later joined Kid Rainbow, a band established by Toronto singer-songwriter Gary O'Connor as a means to promote his songs. She also played in a stage version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show that toured Toronto and area venues.
Both The Wells-Davidson Band and Kid Rainbow met with a degree of local success though it was after being invited in 1982 to form The Parachute Club that Davidson achieved international fame. As a member of The Parachute Club Davidson was the recipient of two Juno Awards for Most Promising Group of The Year in 1984 and for Group of the Year in 1985. Davidson's role with The Parachute Club was primarily as a musician and harmony vocalist, though she is also the co-writer (with John Oates, Lorraine Segato and Lauri Conger) of "Love Is Fire", the lead single from the band's third album, "Small Victories".
Davidson was briefly a member of the well known Toronto band Bratty and The Babysitters, in 1988, when the future of The Parachute Club was uncertain, playing a mix of "rock, reggae calypso, soca, pop and other musical genres".
Bratty and the Babysitters disbanded in 1989, the same year that The Parachute Club formally disbanded for the first time, though the latter's last public performances became those at Toronto's Ontario Place in July 1988.
In relation to her decision to leave the music business noted Canadian singer, songwriter and broadcaster Murray McLauchlan commented as follows: "On or off the stage, she was so present. She had a spark. It made me happy to see her. It made me happy to see the obvious joy when she played her horn. I respected her decision to seek other paths but I sure missed seeing her around." Filmmaker and Parachute Club lyricist Lynne Fernie described Davidson as follows: "Margo was one of those rare people gifted with a magnetic stage presence. She touched thousands of people's souls with her extraordinary sax solos when she played with The Parachute Club. And she touched all of us who knew her with her wry humour and dedication to music."
Advocate for the homeless.
After the initial breakup of The Parachute Club, followed by her choice to leave the music business, Davidson became a creative writer and a director of St. Clare's Multifaith Housing Society, based in Toronto. She was also an outreach worker at Eva's Phoenix, a transitional housing project dedicated to life skills and homeless youth.
In terms of her work on behalf of the homeless, Reverend Brian Burch, President of St. Clare's Multifaith Housing Society, commented as follows: "She was an important part of making sure that St. Clare's got off the ground and that our first project, transitional housing at 25 Leonard, came into being. I never heard Margo the musician, but I often heard her laugh and give encouragement when we had to deal with politicians, NIMBY organisations and construction delays...We were fortunate to have as staff and consultants people like...Margo Davidson (yes, the Margo who was part of the Parachute Club), who have poked and prodded us into being a board of management, a challenge given our background in movement activism."
Death.
For much of her life, particularly in her latter years, Davidson was profoundly affected by depression and alcoholism. Davidson died in her Toronto home on Saturday, May 17, 2008. Her funeral and interment were in Simcoe on May 23, 2008. She left no publicly acknowledged partner. Following Davidson's untimely death, The Parachute Club released the following statement:
Davidson is interred at Oakwood Cemetery, Simcoe.

Oskar Enkvist

Oskar Adolfovich Enkwist or Oskar Enquist (Russian: "Оскар Адольфович Энквист"; 28 October 1849 – 3 March 1912) was an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, noted for his role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.
Biography.
Of ethnic Swedish descent, Enkvist was a classmate of future Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov at the Naval Cadet Corps in 1866. He graduated as a midshipman in 1869 and was promoted to petty officer in 1871. He served in the Russian Baltic Fleet from 1871–1874, and was promoted to lieutenant on 30 August 1874. From 15 June 1884 to 24 October 1886, he was an officer on the gunboat "Sivuch" on which he led an expedition to the Far East. On 13 April 1886 he was promoted to lieutenant commander, while still on his expedition.
On 28 October 1887 he returned to Russia. Enkvist was transferred to the cruiser as executive officer on 9 April 1888, on which he made a second voyage to the Far East from 1890-1891. On board this ship was the Tsarevich Nicholas II on his tour of the various countries of Asia.
From 25 May 1891 to 21 September 1893 Enkvist commanded on the gunboat "Bobr" and supervised hydrological studies off the shores of Korea. While on this voyage, on 6 December 1894, he promoted to the rank of captain.
On the return from this voyage, Enkwist was appointed captain of the training cruiser on 5 June 1895, and commanded this vessel until 7 June 1899.
On 6 December 1901, Enkvist was promoted to rear admiral. With this rank, he became commandant of the port and city of Nikolaïev on 9 September 1902 to 26 April 1904.
During the Russo-Japanese War, Enkvist, largely through the political patronage of his cousin Fyodor Avelan, Vice-Chairman of the Russian Admiralty, he was appointed as commander of the First Cruiser Division of the Second Pacific Squadron, over numerous officers with higher seniority. He made the new cruiser as his flagship. Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky viewed Enkvist as a political opportunist, and refused to allow him an independent command, but instead forced him to sail with the main force around the southern end of the African continent. 
During the Battle of Tsushima on 27-28 May 1905, in order to avoid capture or destruction by the Imperial Japanese Navy, Enkvisk announced to his officers at the end of the first day of the battle that he had decided to flee rather than to continue the battle or to attempt to reach Vladivostok. Over the objections of his officers, Enkvisk ordered the Oleg south, together with the and to the neutral port of Manila, where he and his squadron were interned by the Americans until the end of the war. 
After his return to Russia, he was released from service with the Russian Imperial Navy on November 10, 1907 with the rank of vice admiral.
Oskar Adolfovitch Enqvist died on March 3, 1912 in Kronstadt and was buried there.

Roman military tombstones

The archaeology of death in the Roman period provides great detail into the lives and practices of the Imperial Roman army.
Tombstone form.
The most familiar form of commemoration in death is the standing stone stelae; stone slabs taller than they are wide upon which they are inscribed with simple commemorative epitaphs. This may simply include a bordered written inscription, or one with added iconography of the deceased. 
Military tombstones are most commonly from the 1st and 2nd centuries CE; the pre-Marian army used soldiers for specific campaigning periods; such soldiers would return to civilian life after serving in Rome's conflicts. The longer terms of military service instituted in the late 1st century BCE provide more numerous examples.
Epigraphic style.
The Latin inscriptions on such tombstones can provide details on several aspects of life in the Roman army including:
Age - Through the Latin 'ANNORUM', an age at death is often provided like in modern headstones. Of a sample of 531 tombstones from the Roman period it was found that a trend exists whereby the age at death is rounded to the nearest five or ten, but this is not a uniform pattern.
Enlistment- Vegetius argues that enlistment occurs upon entering puberty, but Scheidel's sample discovered that around 50% of the tombstones showed enlistment occurring between ages 17 and 20, with an increase to 80% if ages 17 to 24 are included. There are also five examples of enlistment between ages 33 to 36 and one example at age 13.
Rank - Rank is an important factor in the Roman Army and one that is clearly visible in death. Examples exist showing the rank and file of the legions and auxiliary units, but also of centurions, standard-bearers, "bene ficarii" – units attached to the legatus's bodyguard and armourers,
One of the most famous tombstones from the Roman world is one of a centurion named Marcus Caelius. The inscription reads thus: 
MCAELIO T[iti FLEM[onia tribv BON 
I OLEG[ionis XIIX ANN LIIIS 
OCCIDIT BELLO VARIANO OSSA 
INFERRE LICEBIT PCAELIVS T[iti F 
LEMtribv FRATER FECIT 
To Marcus Caelius, son of Titus, of the Lemonian district, from 
Bologna, first centurion of the eighteenth legion. 53½ years old. 
He fell in the Varian War. His bones 
may be interred here. Publius Caelius, son of Titus, 
of the Lemonian district, his brother, erected (this monument). 
Iconographic style.
The visual representation above the Latin inscription is important indeed as it provides an image of how the deceased has been immortalised in death. Several tombstones of auxiliary cavalrymen depict them in a killing-scene, riding high over a defeated (usually Gallic styled) foe. A recent discovery, in 2007, at Lancaster, Lancashire depicts a cavalryman stationed in Britain called Insus. Instead of a relief showing him mid-kill, Insus rides tall over a prone enemy whilst holding the severed head of his victim in a victorious pose.
The tombstone of Marcus Caelius, at Xanten, is a particularly well known and ornate example of a legionary tombstone. He is shown in a deep set relief, flanked by busts of his freedmen, underneath a classical colonnade and pediment. He holds the "vitis", the cane held by a centurion and can be seen to wear the crown of oak – a symbol that he has saved another's life at some point.
Purpose.
Clearly the use of tombstones is held in the same regards as it is today – the living fulfilling an obligation of respect to the deceased. Hope argues that these funerary monuments do not necessarily reflect the realities of military society but the rhetoric of language and image through which society was constructed. The lack of tombstone evidence in Britain, when compared to Germany for example, reveals that other methods of commemoration must have been used; such as perishable wooden tombstones that would not survive, or un-marked grave sites.

Gerad Hamar Gale

Overview.
Hamar Gale was born into a royal Warsangali Darod family, as the son of Gerad Dhidhin, the founder of the Warsangali Sultanate. He succeeded his father as Sultan in 1311.
Hamar Gale's popular nickname "Hamar Gale" or "Xamar Gale" first came about after he departed his clan's traditional strongholds in northern modern-day Somalia for the ancient southeastern city of Mogadishu (popular known as "Xamar") and its environs -- an area to which his sobriquet is a direct reference. His nickname thus literally translates as "Mogadishu settler."
After Hamar Gale eventually left Mogadishu, he is believed to have then established a permanent settlement elsewhere. His modern descendants that still reside in the region between the southern middle Shebelle River and the Benadir zone have preserved the "Warsangali" clan name denoting their ancestral origin. However, they have since completely integrated into the local Abgaal, the main Hawiye sub-clan in Mogadishu.
Hamar Gale continued to assume leadership of the Warsangali Sultanate until 1328, when he was succeeded atop the throne by Gerad Ibrahim.

Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi

Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM, ) is a Pakistani militant group whose objective is to enforce Sharia law in the country. The rebel group took over much of Swat in 2007. It was founded by Sufi Muhammad in 1992, and was banned by President Pervez Musharraf on January 12, 2002.
The organization is active in the areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, especially Swat and Malakand but including Dargai and Chenagai. It supports the Taliban forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It has been described as "one of the most dangerous religious militant groups in Pakistan." When the founder was imprisoned on January 15, 2002, Maulana Fazlullah, his son-in-law, assumed leadership of the group. Sufi Muhammad was freed in 2008 after he renounced violence.
Characteristics.
TNSM militia members are "identified by their shoulder-length hair and camouflage vests over traditional shalwar kameez clothing", according to a 2007 Associated Press report. Numerous non-native militants have been recruited to work with the group from elsewhere in North Waziristan, many of them originally from outside Pakistan, including Afghans and Arabs.
Enforcement of Sharia.
As part of what it sees as enforcement of Sharia law, the group has bombed girls schools and blown up video and CD shops. Fazlullah has also used his FM broadcasts to urge schoolgirls to wear all-covering burqas and has forced the closure of some development organizations, accusing them of spreading immorality by employing female staff.
History.
Origins.
The group was founded by Sufi Muhammad in 1992 after he left Jamaat-e-Islami, in which he was an active leader.
1994 Malakand Division Revolt.
Sufi Muhammad fomented an insurrection in Malakand Division (Dir, Swat, Bajaur, Chitral) on the basis of a demand for Sharia law. The uprising was quashed by the Pakistan military but not before TNSM had brought the Dir and Swat under its control. Timergara was besieged by government artillery and fighting was particularly intense in Swat.
It is alleged that while under TNSM control, drivers were forced to switch to driving on the right side of the road, which resulted in many accidents.
2001–2002.
Sufi Muhammad was jailed in November for sending thousands of volunteers to Afghanistan to fight the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. During his imprisonment, Muhammad's son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah, known as "Mullah Radio" for his pirate FM station broadcasts, led TNSM.
President Pervez Musharraf banned the group on January 12, 2002.
2005.
After a brief decline, the group experienced a revival in the aftermath of the October 2005 earthquake. Radio broadcasts reinforced local beliefs that the earthquake was a punishment for sins, and local inhabitants of the region destroyed electronic equipment, such as televisions and computers, in response.
2007.
In July 2007, the group took over much of the Swat District and held on to it as late as November, when Pakistani forces ousted Maulana Fazlullah and his followers from a large base in the village of Imam Dheri.
The stronghold, eight kilometres from the valley's main town of Mingora in Kabal Union Council of northwestern Swat, was guarded by about 200 rebel fighters.
An Associated Press reporter who visited the base in October 2007 described it as a concrete complex near the village. "Inside is a mosque and a maze of dozens of rooms, many still under construction. A shop sells audio cassettes of speeches by Fazlullah." Although the seminary hadn't opened for students, it was drawing thousands of worshippers for Friday prayers, residents told the Associated Press. Fazlullah's spokesman, Sirajuddin, then based at the seminary, is a gray-bearded militant who goes by only one name.
About 250 militants died in two weeks of fighting in late November, during which the two-square-kilometer base was bombarded by artillery, according to Pakistani authorities. People in a number of towns destroyed the fortified bunkers the rebels, including Fazlullah and Sirajuddin, had left behind as the militants retreated into the mountains.
Collaboration with the TTP.
In the aftermath of the 2007 siege of Lal Masjid, Fazlullah's forces and Baitullah Mehsud's Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) formed an alliance. Fazlullah and his army reportedly received orders from Mehsud.
Attacks on Buddhist sculptures.
On October 8, 2007 members of the TNSM group used dynamite to obliterate the face of the 23 foot high colossal image of a seated Buddha carved in c. 7th century CE into a reddish rock face on a hillside to the southwest of the village of Jehanabad (Shakhorai) near Manglawar in Swat district. According to Aqleem Khan, an archaeology department official of North Western Frontier Province who spoke to Reuters, the members of this group drilled holes into the rock, filled them with dynamite, then set off the explosion on October 9, 2007 morning.
2008.
Sufi Muhammad was released after he renounced violence in discussion with the provincial government. Eight leaders of TNSM signed a peace agreement that recognized the provincial government's sovereignty, urged an end to violence and declared attacks against police, military and government targets "un-Islamic."
2009.
As of January 2009 Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi had established Shariah courts, that "openly administer punishment to people who dared to violate their strict code of conduct" in a region extending "from Matta sub-division in upper Swat valley to Kabal sub-division close the main Mingora town." 
Campaign against female education.
A January 21, 2009 issue of the Pakistan daily newspaper "The News", reported Taliban enforcement of a complete ban on female education in the Swat district. Some 400 private schools enrolling 40,000 girls were forced to close. At least 10 girls schools that tried to open after the January 15, 2009 deadline by the Fazlullah-led Taliban were destroyed by the militants in the town of Mingora, the headquarters of the Swat district. Over the past 14 months "more than 170 schools have been bombed or torched, along with other government-owned buildings."
Maulvi Omar, a spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), urged the Fazlullah-led Swati Taliban to rethink the ban on female education. Muslim Khan, a spokesman for the Swati Taliban responded that the TTP had not formally requested an overturn of the ban and that his group would continue as planned. However, Khan announced in a phone call to the "Gulf News" on January 28, 2009 that his group would reconsider the ban on education for women in consultation with religious scholars once conflict had ended in the area. He stated, "We are not against education, but we insist that our new generation should be imparted with religious and then scientific and technology education. The Taliban need doctors, engineers and scientists to strengthen our cause." This is also being noticed now that taliban have began to target Pakistani scientists and engineers of the strategic organizations.
Sharia Nizam-i-Adl Regulation 2009.
The Pakistani government announced on February 16, 2009 that it would allow Sharia law in the Malakand region. In return, Fazlullah's followers agreed to observe a ceasefire negotiated by Sufi Muhammad. On February 24, 2009 Muslim Khan publicly announced that the Swati Taliban would observe an indefinite ceasefire.
End of negotiations.
In early April 2009 Sufi Muhammad ended support for peace negotiations stating that the government had stalled the implementation of sharia courts in the Swat valley. President Asif Ali Zardari refused to sign any agreement until peace had been restored in the valley but failed to elaborate on how those conditions would be achieved. At the strong recommendation of the National Assembly President Zardari signed the agreement, the Sharia Nizam-i-Adl Regulation 2009, on April 13, 2009. A spokesman for Sufi Muhammad, Amir Izzat Khan, stated that the law would allow for peace in the Swat region and that the Taliban was in the process of disarmament. Muslim Khan added that an "Islamic syllabus" would be instituted in schools and that women would not be allowed to go to jobs or to markets so as not to become "show-pieces."
Destruction of headquarters.
In June 2009, Pakistani security forces bombed and destroyed the Imam Dheri compound that served as Fazlullah's headquarters. The compound had contained residences, a mosque, court and prison.

The Daily Mash

The Daily Mash is a British satirical website providing parodic commentary on current affairs and other news stories. Neil Rafferty (a former political correspondent for "The Sunday Times") and Paul Stokes (former business editor of "The Scotsman"), created the website in 2007 and remain the lead writers. Both writers earn salaries from the enterprise and also employ freelance contributors. The publication has garnered praise for its absurd, scatological humour and insightful political satire, as well as being compared favourably with US publication "The Onion". The current editor is comedy writer and former BBC journalist Tim Telling.
History.
"The Daily Mash" was launched in April 2007 by journalists Paul Stokes and Neil Rafferty. Stokes is a former business editor of "The Scotsman" and has also written for "Scotland on Sunday" and "The Daily Record". Rafferty is a former political correspondent for "The Sunday Times", has also written for "Press Association" and "Business AM" and is a former spokesman for the smokers’ lobby group FOREST. The site was originally inspired by "The Onion," a US satirical publication, as Stokes and Rafferty saw a gap in the market for a similar publication in Britain. Both journalists worked mainly for Scottish newspapers and "The Daily Mash" is sometimes aligned specifically with Scotland and its culture. 
Stokes and Rafferty earn salaries from the site and lead a small team of freelance writers. The site earns revenue through advertising and merchandise and is a successful profit-making enterprise. It presents a niche opportunity to advertisers, due to its apparent target audience of procrastinating office workers (Citi employees complained to "The Daily Mash" and independent publications after the company banned them from accessing the site). Highlights of the publication's first year have been published in book form as "Halfwit Nation: Frontline Reporting from the War on Stupid," both to acclaim and complaints of unintelligent, overly crude humour.
According to an online survey, the site's readership mainly consists of university graduates who also read newspapers such as "The Independent," "The Guardian" and "The Times". According to the same survey, 65% of its readers have incomes of more than £30,000, with 22% earning more than £70,000. 81% of the site's hits are from UK users (as of 2008), with 19% coming from the US.
Reception.
"The Daily Mash" provides parodic coverage of current affairs and other stories and has been described as the U.K.'s leading satirical news website. The site "satirises without fear or favour" and aims to provide less politically correct humour than mainstream satire. The site's humour has been described as "cruel," "scatological," "absurd" and "irreverent." It is considered a British alternative and upstart rival to the better known US publication "The Onion" and its coverage has been compared favourably and in some instances considered superior to that of the latter. Despite its humour, the site is considered to be insightful on occasion. Some critics have remarked that not all of the site's articles succeed as satire, and that its content lacks the linguistic invention of some other satirical works.
"The Daily Mash's" stories are sometimes commented upon by other news publications. Acclaimed parodic coverage includes Jeremy Clarkson's much-publicised disparaging remarks aimed at Gordon Brown, the advertising deals of Team Great Britain's medal winners, the nationalisation of Northern Rock, Gordon Brown meeting the Pope and bankers' bonuses.

The Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution (RMBI) is one of the four Masonic Charities in England and Wales. The RMBI operates 17 care homes providing residential care, nursing care and dementia care. It also provides sheltered accommodation, a care advice team, holidays and home improvement loans.
The Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution’s roots started when United Grand Lodge of England inaugurated the Royal Masonic Benevolent Annuity Fund for men in 1842 and the Female Annuity Fund in 1849. The following year, 1850, the first Home was opened in East Croydon named the "Asylum for Worthy, Aged and Decayed Freemasons", and the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution (RMBI) was established. The Home remained in Croydon for over 100 years until 1955, when, due to the need for bigger premises, the Home was transferred to Harewood Court in Hove, East Sussex.
In the early 1960s, provision was extended to non-annuitants and, between 1960 and 1985, a further 14 Homes were set up or acquired around England and Wales. Four more Homes have been opened since then bringing the number of Homes run by the RMBI to 17.

Aida Diestro

Aida Diestro ("Adelaida Diestro Rega", Havana 21 December 1924 – 28 October 1973) was a Cuban pianist, and the director of a famous choral group. She studied music with her father, the Presbyterian minister Diestro Camejo, and continued in a private conservatory. She became the choir director of her father's church, which taught her a great deal about harmony which came in useful later. Aida learnt more from the musician and composer Enrique González Mántici, and his guidance played a decisive role in her future career. Years later she said: "Mantici gave me the confidence to confront the prejudices which female artistes encountered in those days." 
Diestro's first professional engagements was as a pianist on the radio, accompanying artists such as César Portillo de la Luz and Tania Castellanos. Her big moment came when, in 1952, she formed the Cuarteto d'Aida, which became one of the most famous groups of its day. It was a close-harmony group of the filín style, with four brilliant young women. The four were Elena Burke, Omara Portuondo and her sister Haydée, and Moraima Secada. The group, backed by male musicians, sang regularly on the television show "El Show del Mediodía", but only produced one LP record. The original group continued until 1960, and were replaced as they left. After Aida's death the group was led by Teté Caturla.

Dropmore Park

Dropmore Park and Dropmore House are located along Dropmore Road, north of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, England, and is about in size. The park with its buildings have Grade I listed building status. It is one of the most important buildings in south Bucks.
Location.
It is located in the Thames Valley near to the wood known as Burnham Beeches. It is about west of the centre of London and about south of junction 2 of the M40 motorway and about north of junction 7 of the M4 motorway. The nearest main towns are High Wycombe, Windsor, Maidenhead and Slough. Close neighbouring grand estates and stately homes include Cliveden and Hedsor House. The house and estate are not normally open to members of the public.
History.
Dropmore House was built in the 1790s for Lord Grenville, who later as Prime Minister pushed through the law abolishing the slave trade. The architect was Samuel Wyatt. Charles Tatham was architect for changes in the 19th century.
Grenville knew the spot from rambles during his time at Eton College, and prized its distant views of his old school and of Windsor Castle. On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time Grenville died in 1834, his pinetum contained the biggest collection of conifer species in Britain. Part of the restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.
In 1945, after wartime use during which it was harshly treated, the house was restored by Viscount Kemsley, the proprietor of The Sunday Times. He filled it with paintings, furniture and books. After his death in 1968 it was sold to United States International University and then to the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Muhammed Mahdi al-Tajir.
An indoor pool was added, but the house was rarely used. In 1990 it was badly damaged by a fire that took four days to put out. Another in 1997 left the house uninhabitable. 
Dropmore was restored by the company Corporate Estates via the construction firm MP Brothers Limited into a number of private luxury dwellings around 2006-2008. The restoration included the house, Edwardian stables and a number of garden buildings including a Chinese tea house and aviary. Further plans over a 15-year period include restoration of the formal flower beds, Italian garden, woodlands, lawns, vistas, roads, bridges and gates.The developer has since gone into liquidation before the redvelopment was completed.Dropmore was then purchased in 2012 by Richard and Ian Livingstone. The historic research and masterplans were produced by a team headed by Papa Architects and the Terra Firma Consultancy, Landscape Architects.
The exterior of the house and the grounds were used extensively for the location filming of the Doctor Who serial Day of the Daleks.

Théophile Bra

Théophile François Marcel Bra (23 June 1797, Douai - 1863) was a French Romantic sculptor and exact contemporary of Eugène Delacroix. He was deeply involved in the Romantic era through his uncompromising personality and complex spirituality. His fantastical inspiration evokes the universes inhabited by Goya, William Blake or Victor Hugo - he was at one and the same time a Bonapartist and an anglophile, a passionate Christian disciple of Swedenborg and an admirer of Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism.
Life.
From a family that had been sculptors for four generations, Bra studied art in Paris. He won second prize in the Prix de Rome in 1818 and was made a Freemason in 1824 in Douai's "la Parfaite union" lodge. He also belonged to lodges in Paris, Lille and Douai between 1825 and 1840. He left his birthplace of Douai 100 boxes and albums of torrential writings, holding 5,000 drawings associated with the texts. Many sheets from this bequest, now kept in Douai's City Library, have been the subject of exhibitions in the United States and France, such as at Balzac's house, the Musée de la Chartreuse at Douai and the Musée de la vie romantique in Paris.
Works.
His marble and plaster sculptures are numerous, in Douai's Musée de la Chartreuse, Paris churches and the museums at Versailles, Lille and Valenciennes, many of them being commissions under the Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy. Others are to be seen on the Église de la Madeleine, Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.

SEDES

The SEDES is one of the oldest Portuguese civic associations and think tanks. 
History.
It was incorporated in 1970, and its founders came from different academic, social, professional and political affiliations. What joined them was a great desire for change and to establish a diverse social activism: academic associations, a practice of political opposition against the system of the Estado Novo regime that ruled Portugal since the 1920s, participation in Christian organizations and trade union activities. A common denominator animated the founders of SEDES: humanism, socio-cultural development and democracy. 
SEDES held meetings, organized themselves into working groups, facilitated debates on various locations of Portugal, was the first Portuguese organization to proclaim the advantages of a rapprochement with the European Community and was a pluralistic school of civics.
With the advent of democracy on 25 April 1974, many of his associates have contributed to the social and political life of the country in various political parties. Perhaps there has not been a single government since the April 25, which do not contain among its members figures associated with SEDES.

Australian Commonwealth Horse

The Australian Commonwealth Horse (ACH) was a mounted infantry unit of the Australian Army formed for service during the Second Boer War in South Africa in 1902 and was the first expeditionary military unit established by the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia following Federation in 1901. Over 4,400 men enlisted in the ACH in three contingents, with troops and squadrons raised in each state and combined to form battalions. Eight battalions were raised, with the first arriving in Durban in March 1902. The 1st and 2nd battalions saw limited active service, conducting patrols against the Boers during the last great drives that ultimately ended the war. The war ended before the remaining battalions arrived to see action, and by the time peace came on 31 May 1902, the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th battalions still remained at sea bound for South Africa. The ACH suffered no fatal casualties in action, although 28 men died from illness.
History.
Raising and training, January 1902.
Following the federation of the Australian colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new Federal government alone had the power to raise military forces and dispatch them overseas. As such it now took over the military establishments of the States and as a consequence, following an approach by the British government, the Australian Prime Minister Edmund Barton agreed to provide a contingent of 1,000 mounted infantry to the continuing conflict in South Africa. This commitment was endorsed in the House of Representatives on 14 January 1902 and the size of the contingent grew over the coming months as more volunteers rushed to join the new force, to be known as the Australian Commonwealth Horse. The formation of the ACH was overseen by the newly appointed General Officer Commanding, Australian Military Forces, Major General Edward Hutton, and was Australia's first expeditionary force. More than 4,400 men ultimately enrolled, and they were formed into troops and squadrons based on their state of origin, before being combined into battalions. Eight battalions were raised in three separate contingents, while a medical team from the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) was also raised. Artillery was not required.
Recruits had to pass tests of elementary riding and shooting, as well as medical tests, amid considerable competition for limited places. Most volunteers were young, single and worked with their hands. Motivations for joining varied, with many seeking to escape from a worsening drought, high unemployment and a heat wave which was gripping Australia at the time. Men from the colonial contingents already in South Africa were also encouraged to join. Competition for commissions and battalion commands was also fierce and the decision was made to appoint all officers in Australia in order to avoid some of the previous problems of 'importing officers' to positions of command. Hutton was also keen to reserve positions for senior permanent force officers so that they may get experience in leadership and staff work, and five of the eight battalion commands were initially allocated to permanent force officers. This had its own draw backs with a number of appointments later disputed, and one—Wallack—was later dismissed amid claims of inefficiency and ill discipline. Training commenced at a high tempo, with Hutton keen to instil professionalism and a high level of discipline in the new force.
The first contingent of 1,300 men sailed between 12–26 February 1902, with the second of 1,100 departing between 26 March – 8 April and the third contingent of 2,000 men leaving between 16 May – 2 June. Included among them were Brudenell White and Julius Bruche, both of whom would later rise to become Chief of the General Staff. They were the first Australian troops to wear the Rising Sun badge, a design chosen for the unit by Hutton.
Active service in South Africa, March – April 1902.
The 1st and 2nd Battalions, Australian Commonwealth Horse arrived in Durban in March 1902 and together with the AAMC were formed into an Australian Brigade. From Durban the Australians were sent north by train via Ladysmith, Elandslaagte and Dundee to Newcastle. By 22 March over 1,000 Australians moved into camp with another 1,000 New Zealanders in the vicinity of Mount Majuba. The brigade subsequently took part in the great Eastern Drive which aimed to encircle de Wet and Louis Botha in northern Natal, however severe weather allowed the Boers to escape. At any rate the ACH played only a secondary role in the drive, consigned mainly to holding the Drakensberg ranges. During late March and early April the ACH were deployed to outposts to block the mountain passes, while a large column drove the Boers towards a line of blockhouses. Apart from minor skirmishes with unseen Boer snipers the Australians saw little action.
The Australians were subsequently sent to western Transvaal, joining Colonel Thornycroft’s Field Force at Klerksdorp. The column—which was predominantly Australian and included the Third New South Wales Bushmen, Haslee’s Scouts (an irregular unit composed of Australians), the AAMC, the Eighth New Zealand Brigade and Thornycroft’s own regular mounted infantry—advanced as part of General Ian Hamilton’s force numbering 20,000 men in the great Western Drive. The advance aimed to drive de la Rey back against a chain of blockhouses between Klerksdorp–Ventersdorp and proved to be the last of the war. The drive began on 19 April, but halted soon after, following news that peace negotiations were progressing. On 21 April the ACH moved out of camp and turned away from the blockhouse line towards the western railway, with orders to destroy crops and mealie fields and to push the Boers back towards the railway barrier.
On 7 May the Australians again advanced, driving forward over four successive days across dry and open country over a large front. Ultimately the drive succeeded with few incidents, significantly diminished the Boer supplies in the area, and leading to the capture of thousands of head of livestock, nearly 200 wagons and 7,000 rounds of ammunition. Although hundreds escaped, 367 Boers were captured after becoming trapped, although only one was killed. There were no Australian casualties.
The continued success of the blockhouse system, coupled with the approaching winter and shortages of food and clothing forced the Boer leaders to re-open peace negotiations. As such with the war all but over the ACH set up camp along the Klerksdorp–Ventersdorp blockhouse line, and although they continued to send out patrols they had little to do but await the inevitable peace. Despite seeing limited combat, Australian conduct in the field was considered to have been of a high standard, both in terms of military efficiency and discipline. Indeed the ACH showed a level of professionalism perhaps unseen in previous Australian contingents.
Negotiations continued, with the Boer leaders again meeting their British counterparts at Vereeniging, between Pretoria and Kroonstad. Meanwhile at Elandsfontein the second contingent of the ACH was concentrating after having landed at Durban in late April. On 31 May the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed and the war came to an end, even as the men of the third contingent of the ACH remained at sea, bound for South Africa.
Return to Australia, August 1902.
Although many men remained in South Africa to start a new life after discharge, the bulk of the contingents began to return to Australia by ship between July and August 1902. Misfortune followed them however, and when the SS "Drayton Grange" arrived in Melbourne on 7 August with 2,043 troops aboard, five men were already dead from measles and influenza, while another 12 died within weeks. Neglect and unsanitary living conditions aboard the vessel were found to be to blame for the deaths, following a Royal Commission into the matter.

Milow

Jonathan Vandenbroeck (; born 14 July 1981 in Borgerhout), better known by his stage name Milow, is a Belgian singer-songwriter and one of the most successful DIY musicians in Europe. 
Milow released his debut album, "The Bigger Picture", in 2006 on his own label Homerun Records. The fourth single from that album, "You Don't Know," became one of the biggest hit singles of the year in Belgium in 2007, and "The Bigger Picture" stayed on the Belgian album chart for 110 weeks. However, it was not until his second self-released album "Coming of Age" in 2008 (in 2009 renamed and repackaged as "Milow"), that Milow achieved major commercial success all over mainland Europe. The album peaked at number three on the German Album Top 50 chart, at number four in the Swiss Album Top 100, and peaked in the top twenty of many European charts. The album reached platinum in Germany and Switzerland, it reached gold in France, The Netherlands, and Belgium, and it sold over 500,000 copies in mainland Europe and Canada. 
Milow's international breakthrough came with the release of the single "Ayo Technology", a song originally written and recorded by 50 Cent, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, from the album "Milow". The single peaked at number one in The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, peaked at number two in Germany, Spain, Austria, and peaked in the top ten in France, Italy and Finland. The song was a huge commercial success, receiving a platinum certification in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark and gold certification in Spain and The Netherlands.
Early life.
Milow was born in Borgerhout, near Antwerp in Belgium, as the second of four children, with a Belgian father and a mother from the Netherlands. He grew up in Wespelaar, Haacht, a small town with a population around 15,000 (in between Brussels, Leuven, and Mechelen), which is right next to Werchter, a town famous for its Rock Werchter festival, one of the biggest annual rock music festivals in Europe. Milow has said that his first concert experience was seeing Pink Floyd in Werchter in September 1994, on the group's final tour. The show inspired him to make his own music, and he became determined to perform on the festival site in Werchter one day. According to a documentary which aired on Belgium's Canvas TV in December 2011, Milow grew up in a house full of music instruments and signed up for accordion lessons with a local music teacher when he was a kid, but soon started taking piano and guitar lessons as well.
Milow spent a year as an exchange student in California, USA with the AFS Intercultural Programs in 1999-2000, where he wrote and performed songs. He has often said in interviews that this time helped him improve his skills writing songs in English and that he always felt he would one day return to California.
In 2003, after having played in a few bands with friends from high school, Jonathan decided to start playing solo gigs and chose "Milow" as his artist name. Often asked why exactly that name, he has answered that there wasn't really a specific meaning, he just thought it would be easier for an international audience than his full name.
Milow was first heard at Humo's Rock Rally, a prestigious battle of the bands contest for unsigned rock bands in Belgium, organized every second year since 1978 by Belgian magazine HUMO. Many Belgian bands and artists, like dEUS, The Black Box Revelation, Absynthe Minded, Evil Superstars, Novastar, Arid, Das Pop, Admiral Freebee and Goose, launched their career in the Rock Rally. Milow's performance was awarded with a position in the finals but he did not win.
Music career.
"The Bigger Picture" (2005-2007).
In the summer of 2005, Milow recorded his first album "The Bigger Picture" together with Nigel Powell (formerly of the British group Unbelievable Truth and now the drummer for Frank Turner). "The Bigger Picture" was released in Belgium in January 2006 on Milow's own label Homerun Records. The first single from the album, "One Of It," was released in November 2005 and received moderate airplay on Belgian Radio Stations Studio Brussel and Radio 1. Despite some good reviews in the Belgian press, the album entered the Belgian charts at #65 on February 4, 2006 but disappeared again after seven weeks. 
Flemish newspaper "De Standaard" offered Milow a column in their online edition and Milow posted frequently between 2005 and 2009 on this blog titled "Off the Record" about the ups and downs of being a DIY musician. 
Milow's national breakthrough came with the release of a newly recorded single version of the song "You Don't Know," the first of what would become a longtime collaboration between Milow and producer Jo Francken. After a slow start, "You Don't Know" became one of the biggest hits in Belgium in 2007, peaking at #3 in the Ultratop 50 single charts. The single's success led to "The Bigger Picture" re-entering the Top 100 Album chart in February 2007, eventually peaking at 10, reaching gold status and spending 110 weeks on the Belgian album charts.
On June 28, 2007, Milow was the opening act in the Pyramid Marquee on Rock Werchter, which launched his live career in Belgium. At the end of 2007, Milow won three awards at the first edition of the Music Industry Awards (MIAs) in Belgium: Best New Artist, Best Music Video ("You Don't Know") and Song of the Year for "You Don't Know."
"Coming of Age" / "Milow" & "Ayo Technology" (2008-2010).
In the summer of 2007, Milow started working on his second album "Coming of Age" with Belgian producer Jo Francken. According to the album liner notes, most of the album was recorded live over the course of three days with the help of some of Belgium's finest musicians like Tom Vanstiphout and Nina Babet (who both joined Milow's live band early 2008), and Ruben Block (Triggerfinger). In Belgium "Dreamers and Renegades" and "The Ride" were the lead singles. The album was released on Milow's label Homerun Records in Belgium on February 1, 2008. It entered the Belgian Ultratop 100 album chart at #6 on February 9 and reached number one the following week, the first time Milow hit the #1 spot with one of his albums.
On February 5, 2008, something happened that had a huge influence on Milow's career: during a radio visit, Belgian alternative radio station Studio Brussel asked Milow to play a cover song as part of a live session to promote the release of "Coming of Age". Milow opted for an acoustic guitar cover version of "Ayo Technology," a song originally written and recorded in 2007 by 50 Cent, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland. In the next few months, Milow started playing this cover during live concerts and ended up recording a single version with producer Jo Francken and musician Tom Vanstiphout. The single was first released in Belgium in September 2008. 
One day after the video for "Ayo Technology" premiered online, Perez Hilton took notice of the video, calling it "Better than the original." On November 21, 2008, during a press conference in Europe, Kanye West explained why he posted the Ayo Technology video on his website in September: "I like the way Milow took the popular song and just completely flipped it, and the video too. So it's something I thought that was a really cool feature just to put on my blog." In the summer of 2009, "TIME Magazine" wrote in an article titled "The Short List of Things to Do": "'No. 1 in Belgium' is not usually a compelling reason to download a song. But Belgian singer-songwriter Milow's acoustic cover of this 50 Cent track, slowly making its way across the Atlantic, transforms Fitty's bawdy original into a riveting and tense ballad."
The sexually charged, tongue-in-cheek video for "Ayo Technology" proved to be a huge sensation online where it has received over 65 million plays on YouTube alone. The single reached #1 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark, peaked at number two in Germany, Spain, Austria, and peaked in the top ten in France, Italy and Finland, as well as a #1 position on the Spotify Top List. The song was a huge commercial success, receiving a platinum certification in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark and gold certification in Spain and The Netherlands. As of December 17, 2010, "Ayo Technology" was ranked #6 in CKOI/Montreal's Top 100 songs of the year, according to Mediabase 24/7. More than 300,000 copies were sold in Germany alone, worldwide more than one million copies. 
"You Don't Know" was released all over Europe as the follow-up single to "Ayo Technology," and became a huge hit. It spent a cumulative 157 weeks on the European single charts, peaking at number seven in The Netherlands, number eight in Switzerland, number fifteen in Germany, and #21 in Austria. The song reached gold in Switzerland and platinum in Belgium.
The album "Coming of Age" was renamed and repackaged in 2009 as the compilation album "Milow" and released in 2009 and 2010 in mainland Europe and Canada as Milow's debut album. The album peaked at number three on the German Album Top 50 chart, at number four in the Swiss Album Top 100, and peaked in the top twenty of many European charts. The album reached platinum in Germany and Switzerland, it reached gold in France, The Netherlands, and Belgium, and it sold over 500,000 copies in mainland Europe and Canada.
In February 2009, for the second year in a row, Milow was a major winner of the Music Industry Awards in Belgium, winning five MIA Awards: Best Male Artist, Best Pop, Most Downloaded Artist, Best Music Video ("Ayo Technology"), and again Song of the Year ("Ayo Technology").
In 2009, Milow performed at some of Europe's most prestigious festivals, such as: Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf (Netherlands) on May 31, Rock am Ring & Rock im Park (Germany) on June 5 & 6, Peace & Love Festival in Borlange (Sweden) on June 26, Tollwood Festival in Munich (Germany) on June 27, St. Gallen Open Air Festival in Sankt Gallen (Switzerland) on June 28, iTunes Festival in London (UK) on July 10, Frequency Festival in Sankt Polten (Austria) on August 21. By the end of 2010 Milow and his band performed more than 300 concerts all over Europe. 
On July 6, 2009, on the way to Stuttgart to perform as support act for Jason Mraz, Milow's tour bus caught fire and burned down completely. The band and instruments were saved. On September 29, 2009 Milow set a world record by performing in front of 50 mine workers at the bottom of the Pyhäsalmi Mine, 1,430 meters below sea level. 
In the fall of 2009 Milow released "Maybe Next Year" his first live album and DVD, consisting of live recordings between 2008 and 2009. 
In January 2010, Milow recorded a duet with Norwegian singer/songwriter Marit Larsen entitled "Out of My Hands." The song was originally released on Milow’s second album "Coming of Age", released in 2008 in Belgium. The duet version featuring Marit was released on February 12, 2010 via Milow’s Myspace page and Marit's YouTube page. 
In January 2010, Milow won the first ever Public Choice Award at the seventh annual European Border Breaker Awards (EBBAs) in Groningen, the Netherlands. Upon accepting the award, he thanked his fans for being "the first to believe in my music when no one wanted to support me," before urging the audience to legitimately pay for music they love. On March 2, 2010, Milow won an award for "Best International Newcomer" at the Swiss Music Awards in Zurich, Switzerland. The other two nominees were Kings of Leon and Lady Gaga.
"North and South" (2011-2014).
When touring in Europe in 2009 and 2010, Milow started writing new songs and trying them out live at concerts. The album "North and South" was recorded in Belgium with producer Jo Francken in 2010. Five tracks on the album were mixed by Grammy Award winning audio engineer Tony Maserati, known for his work with Jason Mraz, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Robbie Robertson and Sergio Mendes. 
On April 1, 2011 Milow released the album "North and South" simultaneously in mainland Europe and Canada. It entered the charts at #3 in The Netherlands, #4 in Germany and #5 in Belgium and Austria, and reached gold in Germany and platinum in Belgium. "You and Me (In My Pocket)", a sweetly sung but deceptively twisted love song, became the lead single for the new album. The single became a European airplay hit and peaked at #3 in Germany, at #6 in Belgium and Austria, and at #10 in Switzerland. The song reached gold in Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria, and platinum in Germany with more than 350,000 copies sold. 
"You and Me (In My Pocket)" has a music video (directed by longtime collaborator Isaac E. Gozin) that was shot in one single camera take. Perez Hilton posted this video on his blog and wrote, "If you like Jason Mraz or Jack Johnson, then you will love this!!! Milow is back with an instantly catchy folk/pop nugget!"
In an interview with "PRI's The World" Milow said the title "North and South" is a nod to all the non-stop touring he’s been doing, from Northern Europe to Southern Europe. The song "The Kingdom" from "North and South" included lyrical references ("Where I'm from they are divided between the North and the South") to the political division in Belgium between the Northern and Southern parts of the country. In the interview with "PRI's The World", Milow says it’s the first political song he’s ever written. Just like he predicted in the song ("Where I'm from they don't like dreamers, they're told to shut their mouth"), Milow was attacked by right-wing Flemish politicians on Twitter after an interview in newspaper "De Standaard", in which he talked about the new album and about Belgian politics.
On April 27 and 28, 2011, Milow performed two sold-out headline shows in a row in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, Belgium. On July 8, Milow performed for the first time at the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, the best-known music festival in Switzerland and one of the most prestigious in Europe. On July 9, he played his biggest headline concert in Europe so far, for 5,000 people in Munich, Germany. On July 28, 2011, Milow opened for Jack Johnson in Wiesen, Austria, and was invited on stage to perform Johnson's song "Breakdown."
The folk-tinged pop song "Little in the Middle" was released in July 2011 as the second single from "North and South." It reached the number one spot in the Airplay Charts in Belgium and Austria, and reached the top ten airplay spot in Germany and Switzerland. Following this release, Milow had his biggest headlining tour so far with more than 50 concerts in 12 countries. Support acts on this tour included Brett Dennen, Priscilla Ahn and Marlon Roudette.
In December 2011, Milow again won three MIA awards: 'Best Live Act', 'Best Male Solo Artist' and 'Best Pop Act', bringing his total to eleven Music Industry Awards so far.
In February 2012, Milow held a five-night residency performing solo at the intimate Hotel Cafe in Hollywood, California. The Hotel Cafe is a live music venue that has become known for helping to establish the careers of new singer-songwriters. Milow's first solo performance at Hotel Cafe was filmed by "Last Call with Carson Daly," and both "You Don't Know" and "You and Me (In My Pocket)" were broadcast on NBC on February 9.
Since the start of his career, Milow has been a DIY artist, acting as his own manager, publisher and releasing albums on his own label, Homerun Records. Recently, he signed a management contract with Red Light Management in the US. 
In April 2012, it was announced that Milow would release "Born in the Eighties," a six-song EP, as his first US release on July 10, 2012.
On October 2nd 2012, Milow played in Beijing, China, marking his first Asian performance
"Silver Linings" (2014).
In April 2014, Milow released Silver Linings. The album was recorded live in Los Angeles at Fairfax Recordings, the studio known in music history as Sound City Studios; great albums by Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Neil Young and Nirvana were created here. Together with his producer of many years Jo Francken (who was at the helm for both Milow’s European debut “Milow" and "North and South") and Kevin Augunas (known for his work for Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, The Lumineers, Cold War Kids and Valerie June), Milow surrounded himself with an illustrious team: Clif Norrell (Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Tom Petty) was at the mixing desk, Larry Goldings (James Taylor, Norah Jones, Maceo Parker) was on keyboards and Matt Chamberlain (Fiona Apple, David Bowie, Kanye West) on drums. Guitars were provided by Val McCullum (Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson) and Tom Vanstiphout (a member of Milow's band since 2007). The album features a 13-piece live string section, as well as additional guests like Roger Manning Jr. (Beck), Greg Leisz (Ray LaMontagne, Eric Clapton) and introduces Courtney Marie Andrews, a 23-year-old singer-songwriter from Seattle who has already released four solo albums, providing backing vocals.

Great St Bernard Hospice

The Great St Bernard Hospice is a hospice or hostel for travellers in Switzerland, at 2469m altitude at the Great St Bernard Pass in the Pennine Alps. The frontier with Italy is only a few hundred metres to the south.
History.
The first hospice or monastery was the 9th century one at Bourg-Saint-Pierre mentioned for the first time around 812-820. This was destroyed by Saracen incursions in the mid-10th century, probably in 940, the date at which they also occupied Saint-Maurice. Around 1050 saint Bernard of Menthon, archdeacon of Aosta, regularly seeing travellers arriving terrorised and distressed, decided to put an end to mountain brigandage in the area. With this in mind he founded the hospice at the pass which later bore his name (it was originally dedicated to St Nicholas). The church's first textual mention is in a document of 1125. The hospice was placed under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Sion, prefect and count of Valais, thus explaining why the whole pass is now in Swiss territory.
The St. Bernard dog breed was created at the hospice from cross-breeding dogs, probably those offered by families in Valais in the 1660s and 1670s. The first definite mention of the breed is in 1709. The breed was originally raised to provide guard dogs for the hospice, before they became mountain rescue dogs. (The raising was transferred to the Barry foundation at Martigny in 2004.) In June 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a monumental tomb to be built at the Hospice for Louis Desaix (killed at the battle of Marengo), even though Desaix had not crossed the Alps with the armée de réserve. His body rested at Milan from 1800 to 1805, when it was buried at the hospice in the presence of Berthier, representing the emperor. A commemorative monument set up there in a chapel was moved in 1829, so that Desaix now lies anonymous under an altar dedicated to Saint Faustina.

Sim Shalom

Sim Shalom (; "Grant Peace") is a blessing that is recited at the end of the morning Amidah in the Ashkenazic tradition. There is a different version of this prayer, Shalom Rav (שָׁלוֹם רָב), for the evening Amidah. In the Sefardic, Chasidic-Sefardic, and Nusach Ari rites, Sim Shalom is said at all prayer services.
Transliterated Text of Sim Shalom.
Sim shalom tovah u-ve-raħa
Ḥen vacħesed ve-raħamim aleinu ve-al kol Yisrael amekha
Barkheinu Avinu kulanu ke-eħad be-or panekha

English Translation of Sim Shalom.
Grant peace everywhere goodness and blessing,
Grace, lovingkindness and mercy to us and unto all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your face;
For by the light of Your face You have given us, Adonai our God,
The Torah of life, and love of kindness, and righteousness and blessing and mercy and life and peace;
And may it be good in Your eyes to bless Your people Israel at all times and in every hour with Your peace.
Praised are You, Adonai, who blesses His people Israel with peace.

I'm on a Boat

"I'm on a Boat" is a single from The Lonely Island's debut album "Incredibad". It was also featured as a "Saturday Night Live" Digital Short. The song features R&B singer T-Pain. The song, produced by Wyshmaster, is a parody of many rap video clichés, especially the music video for the Jay-Z song "Big Pimpin'." The music video reached number one on YouTube in February 2009 and was number one on the U.S. iTunes music video chart. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Grammy Awards. The Lonely Island has also performed the song live on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" with Black Thought filling in for T-Pain. The song went
platinum.
Music and lyrics.
The song features an aggressive delivery of the lyrics which are peppered with strong profanity throughout while making simple proclamations, ranging from the mundane ("The boat engine make noise") to the insane ("I'm gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow"). Schaffer at one time claims to be riding a wild dolphin, and doing flips, and at another time to be climbing buoys. Samberg sings that he's "king of the world, on a boat like Leo" referring to Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie Titanic, and mentions Kevin Garnett's 2008 NBA championship finals victory quote "anything is possible".
Music video.
Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the video opens with Andy Samberg — who is sitting at the kitchen table with bandmates Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone — pouring cereal into a bowl. To his delight, a coupon for a free boat ride for three falls out of the box. After pondering who will go with him, Samberg picks Schaffer but skips over Taccone in favor of the previously unseen R&B singer T-Pain, who has apparently been sitting at the table, off camera, the entire time.
The three men are next seen atop the yacht "Never Say Never" in Biscayne Bay, Florida, dressed in tuxedos as Samberg announces that they are about to set sail on a boat. The video frequently shows flashes of the left-out Taccone at comparatively mundane places, like "at Kinko's straight flippin' copies", taking out the trash, or lifting a parking ticket from his car. The rap portion of the video places the three throughout the boat and in varying attire, including full tuxedos, a flight suit (parodying George W. Bush's 2003 Mission Accomplished speech), traditional sailor costumes, white naval uniforms, "a nautical-themed pashmina afghan" and typical casual and formal resort wear.
Critical reception.
Giving the song four stars, "Rolling Stone" said it is "one of the strongest Saturday Night Live hip-hop hits since Eddie Murphy was funny." Stereogum called the tune "a 2:42 masterclass in stunting." "The A.V. Club" said the song "holds up well on physical media." As of April 2011, the video has been viewed more than 110 million times on YouTube alone and was featured by "Entertainment Weekly", "Stereogum", and G4's "Attack of the Show".
In December 2009, "I'm on a Boat" received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Grammy Awards, a category held for a rhymed/sung collaborative performance by artists who do not normally perform together, losing to Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Rihanna's song "Run This Town".

James Kay (British inventor)

James Kay (born near Entwistle, Lancashire, 1774; died Turton, Lancashire, 1857) was a British inventor who developed a successful wet spinning process for flax in 1824, helping industrialise linen spinning in the British Isles. Thus allowing it to be a great commercial success and gain a forefront position in the world.
Kay was born at Edgefold Farm near Entwistle, Lancashire, and became a successful spinner with mills at Preston, Penny Bridge and Pendleton.
There were difficulties with Kay's patent application in 1825, which had been taken out for fourteen years. It seems he had been badly advised when his patent was drawn up. This resulted in the validity of his new development being disputed by John Marshall, of Leeds. Kay was forced to sue Marshall in court in 1835 for non-payment for the use of his patent, but the defendants disputed the validity of the patent on the grounds that so far as the invention was new it was useless (maceration process), and that so far as it was useful it was not new (spinning process with 2½ inch ratch). In 1839, the Court found that as the patent was taken out for an invention consisting of two parts, one of which was not new (considered too similar to the patent of Horace Hall), the whole was found void. Kay also failed in his 1841 appeal.
It was possibly as a result of the court cases, and the surrounding controversy, that he failed to get any real recognition for what he did. Which was at the very least to make an adaption and market the new device in such a way as to give British industry the confidence to use it.
Kay died at Turton Tower, Turton, Lancashire, on the 10th February 1857.

Western Australian ministries

The ministries of Western Australia (popularly called Cabinets) are the centre of executive power in the Government of Western Australia. They are composed of Ministers who are responsible for one or more portfolios, answer questions on those portfolios in Parliament, and control the operation and administration of departments, authorities, statutes and votes within those portfolios. In a formal constitutional sense, they possess executive power through being appointed to the Executive Council, which contains all members of the Ministry plus a Clerk (who is a staff member and not a member of Parliament), and is headed by the Governor of Western Australia who represents the Crown.
The members of the Ministry are selected by the Premier of Western Australia and then appointed by the Governor from members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly and Western Australian Legislative Council associated with the governing party or coalition. However, in Labor ministries generally, and the Nationalist Lefroy Ministry (1917–1919), Cabinet's composition is chosen by caucus (a meeting of all Parliamentary members of the party) rather than by the Premier. The Ministry must command the support of the Legislative Assembly—if it either loses a vote of no confidence on the floor of the Assembly, or loses a general election and hence a majority in the Assembly, it is expected to resign and the Opposition Leader, as prospective Premier, is then expected to form a Ministry.
The Constitution of Western Australia does not require Ministers to be members of Parliament, but provides that non-members can only be Ministers for a maximum of three months. This means that when a Government loses an election, the Ministry remains in office (in "caretaker mode") until a new Ministry is presented to the Governor for appointment. For example, when the state election on 6 September 2008 produced a defeat for the Labor government, the Labor ministers remained in office until 23 September 2008, when Premier Colin Barnett appointed a new Ministry.
Until 1948, it was necessary for Ministers, when appointed, to resign their seat in Parliament and re-contest it at a ministerial by-election—these were generally uneventful, but on two occasions, Ministers were defeated—in 1901 when half the Morgans Ministry were defeated, and in 1917 when John Scaddan was defeated upon his appointment to the Lefroy Ministry.

Philosophy.
We believe that each person must face the practical realities of life - its opportunities, its responsibilities, its defects, its successes. How he is to meet this experiences, whether he is to become master or victim of circumstances, depends largely upon his preparation to cope with them - his education. The source of such an education is brought to view in this words of Holy Writ, pointing to the Infinite One: In Him "are hid all treasures of wisdom." (Colossians 2:3) "He hath counsel and understanding, Job 12:13". In a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real development have their source.
Student life.
The school's experience is shaped by many events and extra curricular activities, including the following:
School Anthem.
CBI Alma Mater Song
"O'er the plains and mountains of fair Bukidnon
Where we hear the sweet strains of youth happy songs;
CBI beams brightly bearing e'er the banner high,
School that prepares for Christ's soon coming;
that leads to home beyond the skies.
Refrain:
CBI dear CBI, Alma Mater thee we praise!
We'll uphold thy standard high! Loyal we shall ever be;
'Tis our hope and prayer God grant thee prosperity,
and our bond shall ne'er be broken 'til we reach eternity!
Oh we love to study of God's Holy Word;
blessed wisdom arms us against the foes of truth;
onward sing with courage, God our Guide beside us stands!
May our school, our Alma Mater
flourish till our race is won!"

World War Memorial (Kimball, West Virginia)

The World War Memorial, also known as the Kimball War Memorial Building, stands on a hill in Kimball, West Virginia. Designed in 1927 by Welch, West Virginia architect Hassell T. Hicks, the memorial was dedicated in 1928 to African-American veterans of World War I. It was the first such memorial to African-American veterans in the United States. The building functioned as a community center in the isolated coal mining region until a fire in 1991, which destroyed the interior. The stone, terra cotta and brick Classical Revival building stood as a ruin for more than a decade until a restoration. The memorial building was listed while still a ruin on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
African-Americans represented as much as thirty-five percent of the workforce in McDowell County coal mines, with 1500 volunteering for service in World War I. After a county-funded war memorial was built in Welch, African-American veterans petitioned the county commission for funding, resulting in an appropriation of $25,000 for the building's construction. The completed building housed a hundred-seat meeting room, trophy room, kitchen, recreation center and a library, and was used by local citizens of all races. It was also home to the Kimball American Legion post, which was itself the first African-American Legion post. The building was abandoned in the 1970s. After an abortive proposal to sell the property, studies continued for its restoration until the 1991 fire.
The building was restored in the 2000s (decade) and is used as a community center, winning an Honor Award from the West Virginia chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

When the Tōhoku Shinkansen was opened in June 1982, the planned section between in Tokyo and was not complete, with shinkansen services starting and terminating at Ōmiya Station. The "Shinkansen Relay" was therefore provided to shuttle passengers between Ueno and Ōmiya via the narrow gauge Tōhoku Main Line. Initially, 13 down and 14 up services operated daily, taking 26 minutes for the non-stop journey. From November 1982, the frequency was increased to 28 down and 29 up services daily, running at 30-minute intervals during the daytime off-peak. Services consisted of pairs of 7-car 185-200 series EMUs, providing a total seating capacity of 848. One "Shinkansen Relay" service served a pair of Tōhoku Shinkansen and Jōetsu Shinkansen services. Express 455 series and suburban 115 series EMUs were also used on some trains.
The "Shinkansen Relay" service ended on 13 March 1985, the day before the Tōhoku Shinkansen opened between Ueno and Ōmiya. The 185-200 series EMUs were reassigned for use on other Limited express services such as the "Kusatsu".
Rapid "Shinkansen Relay" (1998–2001).
The "Shinkansen Relay" name was reintroduced between 1998 and 2001 for morning and evening limited-stop services between and via the Musashino Line to provide connections to northbound shinkansen services for passengers originating from the Chūō Line (Rapid) area. Services were introduced in 1997 as the "Komachi Relay" before becoming the "Shinkansen Relay", and were formed of 6-car 165 and 169 series EMU formations. The services were renamed "Musashino" from 2001.
Rapid "Shinkansen Relay" (April 2011).
The "Shinkansen Relay" name was again used for a short period from 12 to 24 April 2011 for limited-stop "Rapid" services operated between and via the Tohoku Main Line as a substitute for the Tohoku Shinkansen, which was closed over this section following the 11 March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Trains were operated using 485 series, 583 series, and E721 series EMUs, with all seats non-reserved.

Aaron Doran

Aaron Brian Doran Cogan (born 13 May 1991), known as Aaron Doran, is an Irish professional footballer who currently plays as a winger for Scottish Premiership club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Career.
Blackburn Rovers.
Doran signed his first professional contract with Blackburn Rovers in May 2008. He was involved in 2008–09 pre-season matches against Macclesfield Town and NAC Breda. Doran was given squad number 39 by Rovers manager Paul Ince in September 2008. He made his first team debut as a substitute for Aaron Mokoena against Liverpool on 11 April 2009.
On 5 October 2009 he was signed by League One club MK Dons on a month's loan deal. On 22 February 2010, he signed for Leyton Orient on a month's loan. Doran made his debut for the club in a 2–0 loss against Gillingham on 23 February 2010. Having played two games, Doran says he's keen to stay at the club for another month. In a 2–0 win over Walsall on 13 March 2010, Doran set up a goal for Sean Thornton, to score the first goal in the game and would score the second. On 29 March 2010, it announced Doran would return to Blackburn after having end his loan, as he made his last appearance nine days ago in a 2–0 loss agsinst Huddersfield Town.
Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce stated in October 2010 that Doran had gone "backwards" since emerging as a "tremendous prospect."
Though Allardyce suggested in the same interview that the player had time to recover, he chose not to select the player for first team squad involvement. After Allardyce was removed from charge by Rovers' new owners, Venkys, Steve Kean listed Doran as a substitute in his first game as manager.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
On 25 January 2011, Doran signed for Inverness Caledonian Thistle on loan for the final six months of the 2010–11 SPL season. Inverness Caledonian Thistle's manager, Terry Butcher, likened Doran to former Watford footballer Nigel Callaghan, suggesting that Doran was part of a wider re-emergence of technically gifted footballers at the top level of British football. Doran made his debut the day after signing his loan deal, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Stuart Duff in a 2–0 defeat at home to Aberdeen.
On his first club start, Doran helped Inverness beat Morton 5–1 to reach the quarter finals of the Scottish Cup, making two assists. His general performance was described as "impressive" by BBC Scotland's game report. Doran scored his first goal for Inverness in a 3–3 draw against St. Mirren. Doran second goal would came in a 1–1 draw against Heart of Midlothian on 16 April 2011 and scored the next game in a 3–0 win over St. Johnstone.
On 13 July 2011, it was announced that Aaron Doran had agreed a deal to join Inverness Caledonian Thistle permanently. He played his first match, since being moved permanently, coming on as a substitute, in the opening game of the season as Inverness lose 1–0 to Hibernian. During a match against Kilmarnock in a 2–1 win, Doran suffered a dislocated shoulder, resulting him out for three months. Two months later, Doran would make his return in a 2–0 loss against St. Johnstone on 15 October 2011. On 28 December 2011, He got injured in a home game against Hibs, playing his first match since his injury. After the match, Doran wouldn't play again and would resulting saw him ruled out for most of the season. In mid-April, Doran is abled to make his return in a 2–0 loss against Aberdeen and would play until the last game of the season.
The following season, Doran set up a goal for Nick Ross in the opening game of the season in a 2–2 draw against St. Mirren. Two month later on 5 October 2012, Doran scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 win over Ross County and made a double assist for Billy McKay and Gary Warren in a 4–1 win over Dundee the next game. Doran was highly praised by the Inverness manager Terry Butcher after the 3–0 defeat of Rangers on Halloween 2012 in the League Cup quarter-finals. "If you give Aaron Doran space he'll utilise it, he'll expose teams and expose space, he's a good passer and a good supplier. He doesn't score a lot but what he does do it create a lot" After a good November month, include a win against Kilmarnock, Celtic and Aberdeen, Doran, along with Butcher and McKay, won Clydesdale Bank SPL November awards In mid-December, Doran announced he wants to stay at the club and hopes Butcher will offer him a new contract. In April, Manager Butcher announced that Doran is close signing a new contract, along with David Raven. At the end of the season, the speculation finally ended for Doran as he signed a new three-year contract with the club.
The 2013-14 season starts off very well for Doran when he scored and assist in the opening game of the season, in a 3-0 win over St. Mirren. He scored another in a 2-2 draw against Celtic a few weeks later. Doran would later continued his goal scoring form, scoring from the League and the Cup.

The Children's Mutual

The Children's Mutual is a trading name of the Forester Fund Management Limited, which is part of Forester Life, a Foresters Family of Companies in the United Kingdom, which is a fraternal benefit society.
Previously, The Children's Mutual was a trading name of the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society Limited, a mutual organisation, until the Society's business was transferred to Forester Life in April 2013. 
History.
The organisation behind The Children’s Mutual brand has a long and distinguished history. Established in 1881, what later became the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society (TWEFS), was formed to provide a scheme for working people to help protect them against loss of income during illness and build up a lump sum for their old age.
When the National Insurance Bill was launched in 1911, The Company were one of the friendly societies chosen to help the Government administer the new state scheme.
Over time, The Company expanded into other areas of financial services, especially long-term savings for children, which increasingly became their specialism. In 2003 TWEFS re-launched as The Children’s Mutual to recognise this specialist positioning and to prepare for the launch of the Government’s new Child Trust Fund (CTF) scheme.
In April 2013, The Children's Mutual and The Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society transferred their engagements to Foresters Life, following a member vote at the Special General Meeting in February. To this day The Children's Mutual brand continues to be used as part of the Foresters family of Companies. 
Operations.
The Company's provides a range of products focussed on providing share-based stakeholder and non-stakeholder Child Trust Fund accounts. In addition the Company offer a Shariah stakeholder Child Trust Fund which recognises that a significant number of Muslim parents want to be able to access the advantages of the scheme in a way that complies with their faith. The Children’s Mutual also provides the Growing Up Bond, a share-based investment plan. In 2008, the company was the recipient of Best Child Trust Fund provider for 2006, 2007 and 2008 from Investment Life & Pensions Moneyfacts Awards. In the 2006 Financial Adviser Service Awards, The Children’s Mutual won a 4 Star Award in the Life and Pension Provider Category.
The company acts as partner for a range of well known financial services and child-orientated brands in providing Child Trust Funds, such as Boots, Asda, Mothercare and Lloyds TSB. The total number of members and other customers that The Company serves more than doubled from 330,000 to well over 700,000 between 2006 and 2007, with funds under management increased from around £600 million to nearly £1 billion.
It is estimated that one in five new CTF accounts actively opened by parents is placed with The Children's Mutual.
Following the transfer of engagements to Forester Life, existing and new customers of The Children's Mutual will continue to be managed by Forester Life.
Headquarters.
The company’s head office was based in Tunbridge Wells. Since the transfer, its parent company, Forester Life, is based in Bromley.

Valdemar of Denmark (bishop)

Valdemar Knudsen (also "Waldemar", born in 1158; died 18 July 1236 in Cîteaux) was a Danish clergyman and statesman. Valdemar was Bishop of Schleswig from 1188 to 1208, officiated as Steward of the Duchy of Schleswig between 1184 and 1187, and served as Prince-Archbishop of Bremen from 1192 to 1194 and again between 1206 and 1217. He held the latter office on the grounds of the archdiocesan capitular election as archbishop elect and of the royal investiture with the princely regalia, but lacked the papal confirmation.
His mother, likely the wife of another man, gave birth to him as the posthumous illegitimate son of Canute V of Denmark in early 1158. His father Canute V had been slain on 9 August 1157 by the co-regent Sweyn III. So Valdemar, like his half-brother, Saint Niels of Århus, claimed succession to the Danish throne.
Valdemar grew up at the court of his cousin Valdemar I of Denmark, "the Great". Still in his youth his great ambitions and abilities crystallised, so that he was determined for the holy orders. Valdemar studied in Paris and Abbot Stephanus of the Abbey of Sainte-Geneviève noted that the Danish prince was mature and dignified like a bishop despite his youth, humble despite his noble descent, and spoke like a Frenchman despite his Danish tongue. After his studies his cousin promoted Valdemar's provision for the See in Sleswick (, ) in 1179, although still too young to be consecrated bishop as successor of the late Frederick I. 
As bishop of Schleswig and steward of the Duchy of Schleswig.
In memory of his late brother Niels he founded memorial endowments at the Abbeys of Ås (by 1192) and Vä (1182). From 1184 on Valdemar officiated as steward of the Duchy of Schleswig for Valdemar "the Great's" minor son Duke Valdemar (later King Valdemar II of Denmark). In 1187 King Canute VI Valdemarsen endowed the diocese of Schleswig with far reaching privileges. At Christmas 1187 Duke Valdemar took over the Duchy of Schleswig and soon later Valdemar Knudsen was consecrated bishop probably in the Cathedral of St. Peter's. After consecration in 1188 Bishop Valdemar levied the tithe, supported by his metropolitan Absalon, since before the tithes had hardly ever been levied in Danish dioceses. 
In 1187 and 1188 Hartwig of Uthlede, Prince-Archbishop of Bremen, and his troops invaded the trans-Elbian free peasants republic of Ditmarsh, ecclesiastically belonging to the Archdiocese of Bremen, in order to subject Ditmarsh also to his secular princely overlordship. The free peasants promised to pay him dues, only to mock about him, once he and his soldiers had left. The Ditmarsians gained support by steward Valdemar, so that Hartwig could not dare another costly invasion. Bishop Valdemar and Duke Valdemar came into conflict with each other on Ditmarsh. Duke Valdemar curtailed diocesan estates of Schleswig and personal possessions of Bishop Valdemar. Cardinal legate Cinthius of San Lorenzo in Luscina failed to mediate in this dispute. 
Bishop Valdemar learned about the abbot, monks, and nuns at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Michael's in the town of Schleswig, who had fallen into immoral behavior and had earned a reputation for drunkenness. Valdemar decided that the best way to reform the monks was to move them from the temptations in town, and establish a new convent, built in 1191, far enough away that the monks wouldn't cause more trouble. In 1192 the monks apparently were moved unwillingly to Güldenholm to begin the work on a new monastery. At some point, Güldenholm Abbey became Cistercian, with the monks working in the fields to earn their daily bread and meat. By 1193 Valdemar endowed Løgum Abbey with the tithe of Bjolderup (near Tinglev). 
In 1190 Emperor Henry VI, had revoked Hartwig's princely regalia empowering his rule in the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen for his partisanship with the House of Welf. The Pope, however, did not depose Hartwig as archbishop, who fled first with the Guelphs to England and then to Lüneburg. In 1192 Duke Valdemar, meanwhile 22 years old, seriously disagreed about Bishop Valdemar's way of leading the diocese. In the same year the Bremian Chapter didn't wait any longer for a papal dismissal of Hartwig and unauthorisedly elected Valdemar as its new Prince-Archbishop - encouraged by Henry VI. Valdemar welcomed his election, hoping his new position could be helpful in his dispute with Duke Valdemar and his elder brother Canute VI. Before entering the Prince-Archbishopric he won the support of Ditmarsh. Moreover the bishop conspired with Adolphus III of Holstein, perhaps also with his brothers-in-law Jaromar I of Rugia and Casimir II of Pomerania, and with Canute I of Sweden and Sverre of Norway. The Bremian mint in the city of Bremen issued coins showing Valdemar's portrait.
Valdemar as Bremen's archbishop elect in Danish captivity (1193–1206).
Duke Valdemar realised the threat Prince-Archbishop Valdemar presented. In 1192 he invited the Prince-Archbishop to meet him in Åbenrå. Then the bishop fled to Swedish Norway to avoid an arrest. The following year he organised - supported by the Hohenstaufens - a fleet of 35 ships manned with Norwegian or Swedish mercenaries and harried the coasts of Denmark with an eye to overthrowing King Canute VI, claiming the Danish throne for himself, while Adolphus III crossed the Eider invading the duchy of Schleswig. On 8 July 1192 Canute VI captured Bishop Valdemar, before he could ever enter the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.
Despite the interventions by Pope Celestine III Bishop Valdemar stayed in captivity in Nordborg (1193–1198) and then in the tower at Søborg Castle on Zealand until 1206. So he in effect couldn't take the Bremian See. After pope (1198) and king (1202) had been replaced by their successors, Bishop Valdemar was released upon the initiative, launched in 1203, of the Danish Queen Dagmar and Pope Innocent III and after swearing, never to interfere again in Danish affairs. Bishop Valdemar left Søborg for Rome. Duke Valdemar, meanwhile King Valdemar II, in return asked the pope the favour to confirm Nicholas as new bishop of Schleswig. Innocent III, however, refused referencing to canon law precepts. King Valdemar II inflicted a series of lawsuits at the papal court against Bishop Valdemar, blaming him for apostasy, alienation of church estates, immorality, perjury and high treason against Denmark. But the bishop knew to successfully defend himself. 
Papally deposed as archbishop, but royally invested with princely regalia.
When in 1207 Hartwig of Uthlede died, a majority of Bremian Capitulars - overlooking the votes of the absent constitutionally provided three representatives of the Hamburg Concathedral chapter - again elected Valdemar. A minority, led by Bremen's cathedral capitular provost Burchard of Stumpenhusen, who had opposed this election, fled to Hamburg, then under Danish occupation.
Valdemar, still asserting himself as Prince-Archbishop, could not hinder Iso of Wölpe, Prince-Bishop of Verden, to capture the Bremian castle in Ottersberg. Hamburg and the neighbouring County of Holstein, both part of the archdiocesan, but not of the prince-archiepiscopal territory, were subject to Danish occupation under Valdemar II, since in 1202 he had confederated himself with Otto IV, rival king against the German King Philip. Philip recognised bishop Valdemar as the legitimate Prince-Archbishop of Bremen, investing him with the princely regalia, thus the Prince-Archbishopric would become his ally against Valdemar II.
Valdemar II and the fled capitulars protested at Pope Innocent III, who first wanted to research the case. When bishop Valdemar left Rome for Bremen against Innocent's order to wait his decision, he banned Valdemar by an anathema and in 1208 finally dismissed him too as bishop of Schleswig. The fled capitulars and King Valdemar II of Denmark then gained the Hamburg chapter to elect Burchard as anti-archbishop in early 1208. Lacking papal and imperial support King Valdemar II himself, usurping imperial power, invested him as Prince-Archbishop Burchard I with the regalia, however, only accepted in the North Elbian archdiocesan territory.
Prince-Archbishop Valdemar confederated with the free peasants of Stedingen, a region within the Prince-Archbishopric whose inhabitants rejected to be subjected as serfs, sparing them from socage. Earlier Burchard, then still provost of the Bremian Chapter, had failed to subject the free peasants by military means. This weakness provoked his mother's cousin Count Maurice I of the neighbouring Oldenburg to subject them and annex Stedingen – also in vain. The free peasants of Stedingen agreed to provide Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with mercenaries, who in return retained any further attack on their freedom.
In 1208 Burchard invaded with Danish troops the prince-archiepiscopal territory south of the Elbe and conquered Stade. In August Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II, who now built a bridge over the Elbe and fortified a forward post in Harburg upon Elbe.
In Bremen Prince-Archbishop Valdemar had been warmly welcomed and nobody cared about the anathema. After Philip's assassination in June 1208, Prince-Archbishop Valdemar as well as the burghers and the city of Bremen joined the party of the former rival king Otto IV, whom Innocent III crowned Emperor in 1209. Otto IV persuaded Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe and urged anti-archbishop Burchard to resign. Bremen's cathedral chapter had fallen out with Valdemar and reconciled with Hamburg's concathedral chapter to elect a new archbishop, this time searching the papal consent. This made Valdemar search for the papal recognition as archbishop, in 1210 he pilgrimaged to Rome and craved Innocent's forgiving, and he pardoned him and lifted his ban against Valdemar. Innocent entitled Valdemar to serve as metropolitan of Bremen ecclesiastical province and archbishop and to ordain priests. Thus recognised by pope and emperor Valdemar departed for Bremen. 
In November 1210 Innocent III fell out with Otto IV, since the emperor claimed papal territory as imperial fiefs and demanded King Frederick Roger of Sicily to render the newly crowned Otto IV homage as vassal for the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria, two imperial fiefs Fredrick Roger held in personal union. Bremen's capitular dean as well as its suffragans Albert of Bexhövede, Bishop of Livonia, and Prince-Bishop Dietrich I of Lübeck, then proposed Burchard's uncle Count Gerhard I of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen, already Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, for Bremen. In late 1210 Innocent III approved their proposal and replaced Valdemar, being a Guelphic partisan, as archbishop by Gerhard I, before Valdemar had returned to Bremen. 
However, in 1211 Duke Bernard III of the younger Duchy of Saxony escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar, the recently papally recognised, but newly papally deposed archbishop, into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the See and enjoying the support of Otto IV. The Bremians rejected Gerhard's claim and favoured Valdemar. Innocent inflicted several bans on Valdemar for his inobedience. Bernard fought the forces of Prince-Bishop Gerhard I, aiming at taking over the Bremian see, while Valdemar alienated Bremian ecclesiastical estates to finance Bernard's warfare. As a reaction Valdemar II, now allied with Innocent against Otto IV, recaptured Stade, while in 1213 Otto's elder brother Henry V, conquered it for Prince-Archbishop Valdemar. In 1215 Henry repelled another Danish attack on Stade.
From 1212 to 1214 the mercenaries from Stedingen destroyed the castles at Beverstedt, Stotel (a part of today's Loxstedt), Riensberg and Seehausen (both a part of today's city of Bremen), all held by partisans of Valdemar's rival archbishop Gerhard I, whom the Stedingers clearly identified as a proponent of their subjection to serfdom. The Oldenburgers successfully defended the Burghagen Castle in Hagen im Bremischen against the Stedingers and Gerhard I mobilised the Count Henry I of Hoya to help, who inflicted the first defeat on the Stedingers in 1213.
But soon Otto IV's position was challenged, losing his uncle's, John Lackland, financial support after the English defeat in the Battle of Bouvines (1214), by Frederick II (Roger), in 1215 replacing Otto as accepted Emperor. Nevertheless, in the same year Henry V, his younger brother Otto IV, Margrave Albert II of Brandenburg, and Prince-Archbishop Valdemar and their troops, among them mercenaries from Stedingen, conquered Hamburg. In the winter of 1216 Valdemar II and his Danish troops, unable to take the city of Stade, ravaged the County of Stade and reconquered Hamburg.
In 1216 the mercenaries of Stedingen swung over to the party of Gerhard I, who promised to respect their freedom, and attacked the city of Bremen, loyal to Valdemar. Henry V rescued the city with his troops. In 1217 the city of Bremen deserted Valdemar's party. Now Henry V, Otto IV and their troops ravaged the Prince-Archbishopric (so-called "Valdemarian Turmoils", 1217–1218). In 1218 Gerhard I and Valdemar II allied to expel Henry and Otto from the Prince-Archbishopric. Gerhard's troops approached the fortress of Vörde disguised as sick, lining up for a treatment by the faith healer and farmer Otbert. Once arrived they overthrew Henry's soldiers in the fortress. After the deaths of Otto in 1218 and Gerhard I in 1219, Henry V reached an agreement with the new Prince-Archbishop Gerhard II, to maintain the "County of Stade" as prince-archiepiscopal vassal.
Valdemar as a monk.
In 1217 Valdemar fled the Prince-Archbishopric towards his nephew Albert I, Duke of Saxony. Later Valdemar entered the Saxon Cistercian Loccum Abbey. The abbot thought he was sick unto death, dispended him for the time being from the bans and received him as a monk by 1219. After Valdemar had recovered, however, he had to do penance and went to Rome in 1220, where Pope Honorius III forgave him, lifted the anathema again, and reaccepted him in the Church's bosom, but forbade him to officiate as priest and sent him to the Cîteaux Abbey. The pope left it up to the abbots of the Cîteaux and Morimond Abbeys to determine Valdemar's future residence. Valdemar was sent to Loccum, as he wished for, living a decent monastic life. 
After in the night between May 6 and 7 1223 Henry I, Count of Schwerin had kidnapped King Valdemar II and his son Valdemar the Young, in order to blackmail the Danish withdrawal from Holstein, Valdemar Knudsen saw again his chance to gain the Danish throne. Valdemar escaped the Loccum Abbey and gathered a crowd of supporters and invaded Danish-occupied Holstein in 1224, but was repelled by the Danish military commander Albert II, Count of Weimar-Orlamünde. Valdemar Knudsen did not recover, he was overlooked as participant in the Battle of Bornhöved (1227), where the victorious Low Saxon alliance of princes stopped the then Danish expansionism. In 1232 Valdemar moved into Cîteaux Abbey again, where he died on 18 July 1236. He was buried at the Abbey.

It is not known whether Dubois himself was present at the event but a close relative, the surgeon Antoine Dubois, died in the slaughter. Dubois fled to Lausanne to escape the persecution of the Huguenots and a fellow refugee, a banker from Lyon, commissioned the painting to commemorate the massacre. 
The painting shows two incidents from the massacre frequently seen in other depictions in prints and book illustrations: the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny's body hangs out of a window at the rear to the right. To the left rear, Catherine de' Medici, emerges from the Louvre and inspects a heap of bodies.
Dubois is also known to have painted a picture of the Roman Triumvirate.

Peppi &amp; Kokki

Peppi & Kokki were a Laurel & Hardy-style double act from the Netherlands; they had their own television series in the 1970s. Gerard van Essen (1924–1997) played fat Peppi, Herman Kortekaas (1930) played lean Kokki.
History.
Early years.
Gerard van Essen began his career in the 1940s at the circus with his sibling Jacques as the Kame Brothers; he adopted the stagename John. When Jacques quit in 1957, he found a replacement in stalwart Herman Kortekaas. 
Throughout the 1960s, they performed as clowns Pipo & Kiko and made their television debut in 1971. There was one small problem; there was already a televised clown called Pipo; thus, the duo changed their names to Peppi & Kokki.
Television series.
In 1972, Peppi & Kokki started working on a slapstick series for broadcast on KRO children's television; they portrayed two sailors forced to take odd jobs because their inherited ship (Alma) ceased to function. 
The intro-footage, reshot by 1974, sees the pair waking up, having breakfast and going off to work (which makes no sense when Kokki chases Peppi for beating him with a spade)
Peppi & Kokki wore vintage blue suits, white hats and Charlie Chaplin-style shoes; Peppi later converted to a pair of sneakers while Kokki stuck to his "space ships" because his newly-bought shoes appeared to be uncomfortable.
The voices were muted out in favour of a ragtime piano and a voice-over. Later episodes featured an in-song recap of events.
Peppi & Kokki; the movie.
In 1976 a spoken movie was taped; "Peppi & Kokki bij de Marine" begins with a trip to the beach (one of the series' recurring subjects) where a bomb is discovered. Peppi & Kokki end up on a ship solving the mystery of a captain receiving so-called death-threats in the rise to his eager-to-miss 50th birthday. The movie was later serialised and got the same treatment as the proper episodes.
Merchandise.
Peppi & Kokki were on a par with successors Bassie & Adriaan who made nine television series (140 episodes) for broadcast between 1978 and 1994. Unlike said clown and acrobat, they never took marketing and merchandise-rights in their own hands, instead leaving it to now-defunct companies. 
Their 30th anniversary in 2004 was celebrated by releasing three DVD's.
The end and next.
The duo split in 1979 after Kortekaas contracted spinal problems. Van Essen unsuccessfully continued with a replacement before touring as a solo-artist on the (children's) party-circuit. 
Van Essen celebrated his 50th career-anniversary in 1992, the same year that Peppi & Kokki were introduced to a new generation; he died on January 2, 1997 during a holiday in Thailand, shortly after learning from the Peppi & Kokki-tune getting the happy hardcore-treatment (Gabber Piet's "Hakke & Zage"). 
Meanwhile Kortekaas returned to children's entertainment but also appeared in a variety of characters in movies and television series, notably Zeg 'ns Aaa in which he played the brother-in-law of Carry Tefsen who once guested in Peppi & Kokki. Between 1995 and 2005 he played a bartender in the successful crime-series "Baantjer".
Trivia.
On June 1, 1977 Peppi & Kokki were interviewed by talkshow-host Sonja Barend; backstage they met the lead-singer of The Jacksons who noted their similarities to Laurel & Hardy and triggered off a conversation about the comedians from the silent era. A 5-year-old fan of Peppi & Kokki joined in and had his picture taken with his heroes and Michael Jackson.

This Place Is Death

"This Place Is Death" is the fifth television episode of the fifth season of ABC's "Lost". The 91st episode of the show overall, "This Place Is Death" aired on February 11, 2009 on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada. The episode was written by executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Paul Edwards.
In 2007, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus try to convince Sun-Hwa Kwon to return to the island. At the island, Jin-Soo Kwon, having survived the freighter explosion, witnesses the downfall of the science expedition. Meanwhile, John Locke and the group continue to initiate their plan, but must do it quickly, especially due to the deteriorating health of Charlotte Lewis.
Plot.
On the island, following the events of the previous episode, "The Little Prince", the latest time jump which has brought the survivors to 1988, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Danielle Rousseau's (Melissa Farman) science team go in search of a radio tower that is broadcasting the Numbers. They are attacked by the smoke monster, which kills Nadine and drags Montand (Marc Menard) into a tunnel that leads to a temple, severing his arm in the process. Robert Rousseau (Guillaume Dabinpons), Brennan (Bruno Bruni, Jr.) and Lacombe follow him into the tunnel and another time jump brings Jin forward two months in time. He first encounters the recently killed bodies of Brennan and Lacombe. He then witnesses Danielle confronting her lover Robert because she believes that the rest of the team became infected while inside the temple. Each of them has a gun pointed at the other. Robert convinces her that they should lower their weapons, then raises his and pulls the trigger. The gun does not fire, as Danielle had removed the firing pin from it (revealed in Solitary). She shoots him. Danielle also attempts to kill Jin, but another time shift occurs and Jin is reunited with the other survivors: James "Sawyer" Ford (Josh Holloway), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) and Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies).
The group is on their way to the , where Locke believes he can find a way to leave the island in his attempt to bring the Oceanic Six back to the island. Several time jumps occur and Charlotte becomes so ill that she must stay behind, with Daniel choosing to stay with her. She tells Jin to keep his wife away from the island, saying "This place is death." She tells Locke to look for a well, if the Orchid Station is not there. Later, she confesses to Daniel that she grew up on the island and that before she left a man told her never to come back or she would die; she believes Daniel is that man. She dies shortly thereafter. The other survivors arrive at the location of the Orchid and find the well. Jin tells Locke to tell Sun that he died and gives Locke his wedding ring as proof because he does not want Sun or their child to return to the island. While descending the well, another flash occurs and Locke falls and injures his leg, resulting in an open fracture. Arriving in the frozen chamber with the wheel that Ben used to move the island in "There's No Place Like Home", Jack's deceased father, Christian Shephard (John Terry), greets Locke and tells him that he meant for Locke to move the island in the first place. Locke then pushes the wheel and leaves the island.
In late 2007, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) confronts Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) during his meeting with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). She intends to kill him; however, he reveals to her that Jin is still alive on the island. She reluctantly agrees to go with him and Jack to another location, where he can substantiate his claims. They go to a church, where Ben shows her Jin's wedding ring, which Ben took from Locke as proof that Jin is alive. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) arrives at the church, in his search for the mother of Daniel Faraday, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). The four go inside the church, where Eloise is disappointed that Ben did not bring the rest of the Oceanic Six.
Production.
Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, found out that her character would die when she was negotiating contracts in June 2008. When Mader originally started on the show in August 2007, she was only supposed to do eight episodes, but due to the writers strike, she ended up doing twenty. Mader said: "I was on the show a lot longer than I thought I was going to be. A lot of it has to do with the writers strike. Less episodes in season four meant back stories were compromised for the new people. I think that's why my character carried into season five." When she found out about her character's death she was "disappointed". "When I got to the end of season four and found out Charlotte had been born on the island, that was huge. So when I found out I was leaving, I was disappointed. Like all things, it's for the best," she said. Mader then reprised her role as Charlotte in the season six episodes "Recon" and "The End."
Reception.
The episode gained 11.862 million American viewers and 415,000 Australian viewers.
IGN's Chris Carabott felt Charlotte's death could have been explored further, but as there was so much happening in the episode not enough time was made for her death. Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" noted it was Jeremy Davies portrayal of Faraday's grief that made him care about her death. Cynthia Littleton from "Variety" said this was one of the few times Charlotte did not annoy her, as she acts as a translator for Jin, "finally dosomething worthwhile".

Camp Daggett

Camp Daggett is a not-for-profit children's summer camp in Petoskey, Michigan on Walloon Lake. The camp is open and staffed year 'round. It is not affiliated with any group or religious organization, but is independent. Daggett offers a High Ropes course, with an indoor and outdoor facility, team building activities, and more.
History.
In 1922 Walter J MacMillan was hired as the physical education teacher at Petoskey High School. Part of the duties as teacher was to run a boys summer camping program. In 1923 MacMillan held a ten-day boys camp south of present day Camp Daggett on Walloon Lake. In 1924 another ten-day boys camp was held, this time north of present day Camp Daggett. In 1925 Camp Daggett opened as a boys camp. The land was a gift from the Daggett Family.
In a Quit-Claim Deed dated 22 September 1924, the parcel in Charlevoix County, Michigan described as "Lot four, less five acres off the north side thereof, of section twenty-one, in township thirty-four north of range six west" was deeded to be held for a camp and it would be known as "Daggett Camp".
Summer camp.
The camp runs for eight weeks out of the summer, from the middle of June to the middle of August. The camp is made up of boys and girls with ages ranging from age 7–14. Campers may attend one week due to high demand to enroll. Campers arrive at 3:00pm on Sunday and leave at 9:00am on Saturday.
In a week at camp, campers will learn how to sail, canoe, kayak, and swim. They will also be involved in arts and crafts, nature and recreation classes. Activities vary according to age - for instance, older campers take part in a high ropes course and more team-oriented activities than younger campers. Each day culminates with a "Night Activity," a series of themed games and activities based on a common theme, such as Mario Party or Indiana Jones. Occasionally, a night activity consists of one large game that the whole camp participates in, such as Capture the Flag or "Gettysburg," a large water fight.
Campers sleep in cabins with approximately nine other children of similar ages in addition to a counselor and, occasionally, a counselor-in-training. Cabin groups take part in most activities together, along with their "brother cabin" or "sister cabin," the cabin group of the same age and opposite gender. One night out of the week, each cabin along with their brother or sister cabin will hike or canoe to one of several camping sites, a time when campers will learn how to put up a tent, cook food over a fire and bond with their fellow campers. Meals are served family style in Mac Hall, a lodge located in the middle of camp.

Desiderius Hampel was a "SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS" during World War II who commanded the 13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian) and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
Early life.
Desiderius Hampel was born 20 January 1895 in the town of Sisak, Austria-Hungary (modern-day Croatia). His father was an inspector on the Austrian Railway, and the family often had to move around Europe, living in different areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This had the benefit of teaching the young Hampel a number of languages. After he completed his primary school education, he was sent to a military school in Karlovac.
After graduation he joined the Army in October 1914, as a warrant officer in the 16th Hungarian Infantry Regiment "Freiherr von Giesl", and in December was sent to the front line.
World War I.
In April 1915, he was given command of a platoon and shortly after promoted to Leutnant and given command of the 14th Company. At the end of the year he was sent on a heavy machine gun training course at Bruck an der Leitha. 
When he returned to the front in November he was given command of the 4th Company of his regiment and was promoted to Oberleutnant in May 1917.
In September 1918, he was appointed as the second in command of the 36th Battalion fighting in Serbia until the end of the war when he became a prisoner of war in Serbia. He escaped from captivity just over a year later and made his way to Vienna and then Budapest.
Between the wars.
After he returned from captivity he started work on a farm and studied forestry between 1925 and 1928 at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. He then worked in the forestry industry until December 1937 when he rejoined the Hungarian Army and served in Budapest.
World War II.
Hampel served in Budapest until March 1941, and was then sent to the town of Csepel, in command of the area defences until December 1941 when he was dismissed from the army. He then joined the Croatian Home Guard with the rank of Major and was appointed as the intelligence officer for the IV Army Corps. In May 1942, after a request from Obergruppenführer Artur Phleps he joined the Waffen SS as a Sturmbannführer.
He was given command of the III Battalion, 1st SS Gebirgsjager Regiment until June 1943 when he was moved to command the Training and Reserve Battalion, 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. Next he was given a position on the staff of the newly formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). In November 1943 he was promoted to Obersturmbannführer and given command of the 27th SS Mountain Infantry Regiment of SS "Handschar".
In April 1944, he was promoted to Standartenführer and soon after given command of SS "Handschar", and in January 1945 promoted to Brigadeführer and Generalmajor of the Waffen-SS. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his command of the division near the end of the war in May 1945. Hampel escaped from a British prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.
Post war.
Desiderius Hampel survived the war and died on 11 January 1981 in Graz, Austria.

Cock o' the North (music)

Cock o'the North is a 6/8 military march, bagpipe tune and jig. The title comes from the nickname of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, who in 1794 raised the 92nd Regiment of Foot, which later became the Gordon Highlanders.
History.
The composer is unknown, but it first appeared in print in 1816 as a violin tune. It was later published in a collection of bagpipe music by Donald MacDonald in 1822, with the title of "Gairm n’an Coileach" (Scottish Gaelic: "The Cock’s Crow"). Some writers have noted a similarity to the 17th century English tune "Joan's Placket is Torn", which was mentioned by Samuel Pepys and is in John Playford's work, "The Dancing Master". A version of the tune as a reel, from the island of Whalsay goes by the name "Jumping John".
Military Use.
The tune has always been a march used by the Gordon Highlanders, although it did not become the official regimental march until 1933, when it replaced Hielan' Laddie.
Although strongly associated with the Gordons, it was used by other Highland regiments, too. 
At the Siege of Lucknow, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 12 year-old Drummer Ross of the 93rd Highlanders signalled the arrival of his regiment to the besieged garrison, by climbing the spire of the Shah Najaf Mosque and playing "Cock o' the North" on his bugle, while under heavy fire from the rebel forces.
In 1897, during an attack by the Gordon Highlanders on the Dargai Heights, which were held by Afridi tribesmen during the Tirah campaign, Piper George Findlater won the Victoria Cross for continuing to play a regimental march while wounded in both feet. The official statement did not give the name of the tune he played; some accounts state that it was "Haughs of Cromdale" which was the Regimental Charge-tune, others claim it was "Cock of the North". Finlater's own account says that he did not hear an order to play "Cock of the North", and played "Cromdale" on his own initiative.
Besides the Gordons, the tune is, or has been, an official march for the following units: 
"Aunty Mary".
A well known drinking or bawdy song using the "Cock of the North" tune is known as "Aunty Mary". There are a great number of versions of varying degrees of obscenity. They nearly all share the same first two lines. One of the milder versions runs:

Batuje

Batuje (; ) is a settlement in the Vipava Valley in the Municipality of Ajdovščina in the Littoral region of Slovenia.
Name.
Batuje was attested in written sources in 1060–83 as "Batauia" (and as "Buttavia" after 1086, "ze Butinach" and "ze Wutinach" in 1389, and "Watuiach" in 1523).

Conewago Mountains

The Conewago Mountains or Conewago Hills are a low range of mountains in northern York County, Pennsylvania. They run northeasterly across the county. They form the backdrop to Gifford Pinchot State Park and parallel Conewago Creek.
The Conewago Mountains played a role in the early colonization and settling of the region, with settlers north of the mountains being predominantly Scotch-Irish and those south of the range being mostly Germans from the Palatinate region. The mountains provided a source of timber and firewood, and small iron foundries dotted the valley below to smelt iron ore taken from the Conewagos. During the American Civil War, Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart crossed over the mountains at the hamlet of Mount Royal in Dover Township en route from the Battle of Hanover to Carlisle. Scores of farms in the region were raided for horses, and many farmers hid their livestock in the Conewago Mountains to secret them from the passing Confederates.
Today, the mountains offer scenic views of York County and several fine homes and studios dot the hillsides.
Geology.
The Conewago Mountains are underlain by Triassic conglomerate of the Gettysburg Formation.

<doc id="21422711" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21422711" title="Communist Party of Fiume">
Communist Party of Fiume

The Communist Party of Fiume () was instituted on November 1921, after the proclamation of the Free State of Fiume created by the Treaty of Rapallo. The Communist Party of Fiume was the smallest Communist Party in the world at the time. It was founded following the principles of the Third International, according to which each sovereign State had to have its own Communist Party organization.
Origins.
After 1918 the Socialist Party of Fiume, under the lead of Samuel Maylender became the Partito Socialista Internazionale di Fiume. In 1919, a local Communist Party, was founded independently (and almost single-handedly) by Albino Stalzer in 1919, by mobilising the local dockers. Stalzer and Schneider founded also a Cooperativa dei Lavoratori del Porto, whose influence proved to be much greater that that of the Communist Party itself. In 1920 both had a difficult existence during the occupation of Fiume led by the Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio.
Albino Stalzer however proved instrumental in providing working class support to the autonomists of Riccardo Zanella. After the autonomist victory at the elections for the Constituent Assembly on 24 April 1921 the local Fascio staged a "coup d'état". In opposition, the Camera del Lavoro (controlled by the Socialists) proclaimed a general strike, but when its leaders Antonio Zamparo and G. Holly were arrested by dictator Riccardo Gigante a cessation of the strike was proclaimed. Thanks to the Cooperativa dei Lavoratori del Porto the strike continued "motu proprio", forcing the “Exceptional Government” of “Dictator” Gigante to resign and allow the entry of the Alpine troops in Fiume, as requested by the Italian plenipotentiary Carlo Caccia Dominioni.
The "Cooperativa dei Lavoratori del Porto" of Stalzer proved to be the main organised force of the opposition to the “dictator Gigante”, and this was the single most important action done by the leftist organisations in the Free State of Fiume. Moreover, it had clear autonomist underpinnings: what was contested was not only the fascist organisation of the putsch, but its Italian annexationist character.
The normalisation of the situation that followed to the inauguration of the Zanella government in October 1921 enabled the holding of a Fiume Socialist Congress in November, where (as happened in Italy) a Communist Party was formed. The Party originated from a split within the Socialist Party in Fiume, following on from the secession of the Italian Communists from the Socialists in Livorno on 13 November 1921. On 11 November 1921, the Socialist Party of Fiume joined officially the Communist International.
The “old Socialist Party of Fiume” had to discuss the Twenty-one Conditions of Moscow, which had not been discussed at the previous congress since at that time (22 August 1921), in Fiume reigned a “regime of terror”, when the party's “best comrades” were expelled and persecuted. At the Socialist meeting old members were reintegrated into the party. Among them was Árpád Simon, a Hungarian Jew who escaped to Fiume after the failure of the Hungarian Soviet Republic of Béla Kun and was proclaimed Secretary of the Communist Party of Fiume. The Party accepted the leadership of Lenin and proclaimed him honorary president of the party.
The meeting illustrated the division between two factions: the Communists and the Unitarians. The unitarians adopted Lenin's "Twenty-one Conditions" but stated its will to preserve the old name of "Socialist Party", and omitted the intention to eliminate the reformers and the centrists.
After the elections where the communist faction prevailed, a “mozione della frazione comunista” was passed: it implied adhesion to the Third Communist International, the adoption of the new name of "Partito Comunista di Fiume, (sezione della III internazionale Comunista)", the adoption of organization and tactics from the second Congress of the Communist International, subordination to the international direction centres, and the adhesion of local labour organisations to the Red International of Labour Unions.
The party declared its will to participate in the elections but only whilst keeping its “revolutionary purpose" of overthrowing “bourgeois democracy” well in mind.
Simon declared that the Socialist Party ceased to exist and in its place the Communist Party of the Free State of Fiume (Partito Comunista dello Stato libero di Fiume) was constituted. The unitarian socialists were put on a defensive: although they accepted the 21 points and promised not to infringe the unity of the United Proletarian Front,
given the “incommensurable difficulties” of organizing a proletarian party in a bilingual environment, the name Socialist Party had to be retained.
The party issued several articles on the "Lavoratore" from Trieste and "Lo Stato operaio" from Milan, not a single one being published in the Yugoslav communist press, since the organization turned to Italy for its inspiration and guidelines.
On 28 November the Executive Committee of the Partito Comunista d’Italia sent a salutory letter to the Partito Comunista di Fiume. Again, the relationship is always with the PCI, the Yugoslav party is never mentioned.
The funeral of Cesare Seassaro, was the only mass meeting ever organised by the Communist Party of the Free State of Fiume, where several speakers participated. The Young Communist International was represented at the meeting by a speaker – the Italian delegate Secondino Tranquilli, later known as Ignazio Silone.
Notably, the Communist Party of Fiume had direct official relationships with the Partito Comunista d’Italia, while the Yugoslav Communist party is never mentioned. The contacts with the Hungarian Communists were of an informal nature, but definitely important, and continued well into the 1920s. The main party cadres came from Hungary after the end of the revolution. Ella (Gabriella) Seidenfeld was the liaison of the Partito comunista di Fiume with the Communist Party of Italy and later became long-time companion of author Ignazio Silone.
In a letter sent by the Communist Party of Italy to the Federazione gioventù comunista di Fiume it is transparent that the Partito comunista di Fiume is considered by the Communist Party of Italy as a "trait d'union" with the Yugoslavs.
Nevertheless, as for the Fascists, for the Communist Party of the Free State of Fiume the biggest enemy was Albino Stalzer.
Aftermath.
The Partito comunista di Fiume showed some activity in 1922: in January it publicly announced its birth via a public announcement, and at the beginning of 1922 the Statute of the Partito comunista di Fiume was published ("Mozione comunista" and the "Statuto del Partito comunista di Fiume").
In the "Preamble" the Party proclaimed its full adhesion to the revolutionary stances and principles of the II International. The Party was organized in sections along city districts. Each section elected an Executive Committee, that nominated the various commissions (evaluation of candidatures, Communist Youth etc.). The Central Committee had 15 members who nominated the executive committee of 5 members assumes the direction of the communist organ propaganda. The Congress was the sovereign manifestation of the Party. Article 54 allowed for the possibility of the members of the Socialist Party to enter the Communist Party of the Free State of Fiume, within one month.
After the fascist putsch that struck down the Zanella government, the secretary of the Triestine section of the Italian Communist Party, Cavaciocchi, arrived immediately in Fiume, where in an interview with the "Vedetta d'Italia" he implicitly expressed solidarity with the fascist action against the “bourgeois” Zanella.
Again; it was Stalzer who protested the fascist violence, which he denounced in a paper titled "L’Ultima ora", and later with a manifesto and some clandestine leaflets where he denounced the curious solidarity between the fascists and the local communists. That was his last action, before leaving for Portorè where he joined Zanella in his exile, later living an isolated private life on the edge of misery and oblivion.
In September 1922, in a second public announcement, the Communist Party of Fiume condemned publicly the “Primo Partito comunista di Fiume” led by Albino Stalzer, with the charge that the party was close to the “bourgeois autonomist party” (solidale col partito autonomo (borghese) di Zanella) and for his solidarity with Zanella in Portorè.
On 10 October 1922 the delegates of the Communist Party of Fiume were nominated for the IV Congress of the Third International and the II Congress of the Red International of Labour Unions. The secretary of the C.C. of the Partito comunista di Fiume, the Hungarian Jew, Arpad Simon, was elected and proposed Stefan Popper (a Hungarian Jew) as representative of the Partito comunista di Fiume at the conference. If he was to refuse, the Italian communist party delegation at the conference had the full mandate to represent the Communist Party of Fiume .
Progressively, as the fascists extended their power in the city, the activity of the Communist Party of Fiume dwindled. The press releases and reports of the party during the 1923 are defensive acts written after some of the members of the Communist Party of Fiume or simple sympathizers were attacked or arrested.
The last ones were published in the Milanese paper “Lo Stato Operaio”, after the devastation of the "Il Lavoratore" offices in Trieste. With the "communique" of the Executive committee, dated November the 1st 1923, the Milanese paper become (as it was for Italy) the official press organ for the Communist Party of Fiume.
Dissolution.
The last action of the Communist Party of Fiume was a "Manifesto", directed against the annexation of the City to Italy. The document dated 9 November 1923, is the last act of the party.
The slogans of this proclamation are almost entirely autonomist.
Distrust in the League of Nations was openly proclaimed, the invoked the action of the proletariat of Italy, Yugoslavia and asked for the protection by Soviet Russia.
The "Manifesto" had to be signed also by the Italian P.C.d'It and by the Yugoslav Nezavisna radnička partija Jugoslavije.
The answer provided by the P.C.d'It was very disappointing for the Communist Party of Fiume, since they deemed any action as hopeless.
Neither did the Yugoslav Communist Party do anything to oppose the Treaty, as it did not oppose the annexation of Fiume to Italy. In the meanwhile, the faction of the autonomist Communists led by Stalzer went to Zanella and was widely opposed by the Partito comunista di Fiume. The Communist Party of Fiume, before its dissolution was definitely connected to the P.C.d'It, subordinated to the local section in Trieste, that acts as its main organizational and ideological support.

Harry van Bommel

Henricus (Harry) van Bommel (born June 24, 1962 in Helmond) is a Dutch politician, anti-globalization activist and former educator. As a member of the Socialist Party (Socialistische Partij) he has been an MP since May 19, 1998. He focuses on matters of foreign affairs and the European Union.
Biography.
Born in the province of North Brabant, he grew up in Heino, which is a village in the province of Overijssel. Van Bommel was a teacher of Dutch and English before entering politics, having attended the University of Amsterdam to study political science.
He joined the Socialist Party in 1986, eventually joining its executive committee overseeing students, where he remained until 1994. In that year, he was elected to the Amsterdam City Council, having been elected to the Amsterdam East district council in 1990.
In May 1998, Van Bommel became a member of the Dutch House of Representatives for the Socialist Party. Van Bommel's work as a Socialist Party member has, since 1994, included focus on educational policy and on international affairs. In the former capacity, he contributed to the "Alles Kids?" report on diminishing opportunities for youth.
Gaza demonstration 2009.
Following the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip late 2008-early 2009, took the SP MPs Van Bommel and Sadet Karabulut on January 3, 2009 in Amsterdam part in a demonstration against the actions of Israel, chanting the slogan "Intifada, Intifada, Palestine free". This led to criticism of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the Party for Freedom (PVV) and the Centre Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI), which suggested that this was a call to violence. Also, SP leader Agnes Kant said: "I would not have done, because it leads to misunderstandings." Van Bommel denied that he wanted to incite violence. According to him intifada can be understood as "civil disobedience". The incident was reason for the Rabbi Raphael Evers of the "Dutch Israelite Religious Community" (Nederlands Israëlitisch Kerkgenootschap - NIK) to require that van Bommel would not be present at the Auschwitz Memorial in Amsterdam on January 25. The Dutch Auschwitz Committee - the organizer of the meeting - said, however, that Van Bommel was welcome and called the case "a bloated affair." But eventually, Van Bommel let to known that he would not be present because he didn't want "that commotion about his presence at the expense of the actual memorial".
On January 3, 2009 Van Bommel was videotaped at a public rally calling for an against Israel. Radio Netherlands Worldwide reported that the event launched widespread criticism. He was accused of "incitement to hate, violence and discrimination against Jews" in a complaint to the Dutch Ministry of Justice by prominent attorney, and the lawyer of the Dutch politician Geert Wilders in his ongoing trial (2011), Bram Moskowicz. According to Ha'aretz, in an online video Van Bommel's voice can be heard while protesters chant "Hamas, Hamas, send the Jews to the gas." Van Bommel told Haaretz he "did not hear the calls," and would "have left had he heard them."

<doc id="21422806" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21422806" title="Great Recession in Europe">
Great Recession in Europe

The European recession is part of the Great Recession, which began in the United States. The crisis spread to Europe rapidly and affected much of the region with several countries already in recession as of February 2009, and most others suffering marked economic setbacks. The global recession was first seen in Europe, as Ireland was the first country to fall in a recession from Q2-Q3 2007 - followed by temporary growth in Q4 2007 - and then a two year long recession.
Eurozone.
The Eurozone recession has been dated from the first quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. In the eurozone as a whole, industrial production fell 1.9 percent in May 2008, the sharpest one-month decline for the region since the exchange rate crisis in 1992. European car sales fell 7.8 percent in May compared with a year earlier. Retail sales fell by 0.6 percent in June from the May level and by 3.1 percent from June in the previous year. Germany was the only country out of the four biggest economies in the eurozone to register an increase of activity in July though the increase was sharply down. Economic analysts from RBS and capital Economics say the decline raises the risk of the eurozone entering a recession in 2008. In the second quarter, the eurozone's economy was reported to have declined by 0.2 percent.
Ireland.
The global recession was first seen in Europe, as Ireland was the first country to fall in a recession from Q2-Q3 2007 - followed by temporary growth in Q4 2007 - and then a two year long recession. Republic of Ireland in the first quarter of 2008 reported a contraction in GDP of 1.5 percent, its first economic contraction since it began reporting by quarter and first recorded contraction since 1983. However, Ireland's Central Statistics Office reported growth in GNP of about 0.8 percent, Ireland's government considers GNP a better measure of the economy. Analysts have predicted Ireland's economy will contract further in the rest of the year. A report from NCB Stockbrokers predicts gross national product will fall by 1 percent in 2008 and by 0.4 percent in 2009 due to a decline in multinationals hit by the global economic slowdown. An economist from NCB said non-residential investment would fall by 5 percent in 2008 and by 12 percent in 2009.
Ireland's GDP saw a contraction in the second quarter by 0.5 percent making Ireland the first member of the eurozone to enter a recession. The government is being advised by Merrill Lynch, the American broker that ran out of capital in September 2008. In January 2009 it was forced to nationalise its third largest bank, Anglo Irish Bank and to announce recapitalisation of its top two banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland. In February 2009, the government announced record unemployment levels in the country, with its highest monthly increase in 40 years and 1,500 people being laid off daily. 
Ireland exited the recession in the 3rd quarter of 2009 posting a 0.3% growth in its economy, due to recent heavy budget cuts by the Irish government. However, although they technically exited recession, the Irish economy still has a lot of hurdles to overcome if it is to return to normality.
Spain.
Spain's Martinsa-Fadesa, a construction company, has declared bankruptcy as it failed to refinance a debt of €5.1 billion. The two banks with most exposure to Martinsa-Fadesa are reportedly Caja Madrid, at €900m, and Banco Popular Español, at €400m. Spain's finance minister Pedro Solbes has said it would not bail out the company. In the second quarter in Spain house prices reportedly fell 20 percent. In Castilla-La Mancha some 69 percent of all houses built over the past three years are still unsold. Deutsche Bank said it expects a 35 percent fall in real house prices by 2011. Spain's premier, Jose Luis Zapatero, blamed the European Central Bank for making matters worse by raising interest rates. More than 98 percent of home loans in Spain are priced off floating rates linked to Euribor, which has risen 145 basis points since August. Housing accounts for over 10 percent of Spain's economy. The Bank of Spain is concerned about the health of smaller regional lenders with heavy exposure to the mortgage market.
Although Spain has avoided recession in the first half of 2008, unemployment in the country has risen by 425,000 over the past year, reaching 9.9 percent. Car sales in Spain fell 31 percent in May. Spain's factory output slumped 5.5 percent in May. The country's business lobby Circulo de Empresarios warned of a "high probability" that Spain's economy would fall into recession in the second half of 2008 due to the housing collapse. Spain had a 7.9 percent decline in retail sales in June compared to the previous year, the largest drop since Spain began registering the results and the seventh consecutive monthly decline. This included a 17.9 percent drop in retail sales of household goods. June food sales in Spain fell by 6.8 percent.
Morgan Stanley issued a major alert on the health of Spanish banks and the Spanish economy in a report, saying, "A momentous economic slowdown is now under way. We believe the deterioration in Spain is just in the beginning stages. The bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009." Morgan Stanley also warned there was 40 percent chance of a 0.5 percent contraction of the Spanish economy in 2009, with a risk of an even more extreme 1.4 percent contraction in 2009. According to Spanish automobile manufacturers' association ANFAC new car sales fell 27.5 percent in July from the same time in 2007, the third consecutive monthly drop of over 20 percent. Spain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 10.4 percent in 2008 and to 12.5 percent in 2009. Spain's second largest bank BBVA predicted the unemployment rate could reach 14 percent in 2009. Spain's Purchasing Managers Index for the manufacturing sector in July fell to a new low suggesting a deep recession. In the second quarter Spain's economy grew by 0.1 percent, the lowest gain in 15 years.
As of December 2009, Spain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 20 percent in 2009. It's predicted a 25% rate, due to the way the tally is carried out by the government. According to Spain's Finance Minister, the "Spain faces its deepest recession in half a century".
Germany.
In Germany officials had warned the economy could contract by as much as 1.5 percent in the second quarter because of declining export orders. The economy of Germany indeed contracted in both the second and third quarters putting Germany now in a technical recession. Although the idea was fought for a moment Angela Merkel and the German government approved a €50 billion strong rescue plan to protect the German economy of the crisis, making of it Western Europe's biggest rescue plan for now in this crisis.
Germany's industrial output was down 2.4 percent in May, the fastest rate for a decade. Orders have now fallen for six months in a row, the worst run since the early 1990s. The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce warned of up to 200,000 job losses in coming months. German retails sales fell 1.4 percent in June more than any expectations. The German economy declined by 0.5 percent in the second quarter.
Greece.
In 2012 Greece entered its 5th year of recession. In 2011 Greece's GDP shrunk by a further 6.8%, leaving total economic output now 16% below the pre-crisis peak. Eurostat's current forecasts also show Greece's economy declining further in 2012, by an estimated 4.4%
Italy.
In Italy, Fiat announced plant closures and temporary layoffs at factories in Turin, Melfi and Sicily. Car sales in Italy have fallen by almost 20 percent over each of the past two months. Italy's car workers' union said; "The situation is evidently more serious than had been understood." On 10 July 2008 economic think tank ISAE lowered its growth forecast for Italy to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent and cut the 2009 outlook to 0.7 percent from 1.2 percent. Analysts have predicted Italy had entered a recession in the second quarter or would enter one by the end of the year with business confidence at its lowest levels since the September 11 attacks. Italy's economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008.
France, Benelux countries.
Other eurozone members saw a decline in their economies in the second quarter as well; France by 0.3 percent, Finland by 0.2 percent while the Netherlands showed zero growth in the second quarter. However the final estimates released by the INSEE, France's statistical agency, showed the French economy grew by 0.14 percent during the third quarter thus barely avoiding a technical recession. In the first quarter of 2009, France fell into recession, the last developed nation in Europe to do so.
In order to fight the economic crisis, French president Nicolas Sarkozy announced a €26 billion rescue plan which will amount to an additional €15.5 billion in addition to the normal budget for 2009 and will increase France's public deficit to 4%. It is similar, to an extent, to Barack Obama's proposal to stimulate the U.S. economy by investing in the nation's vital infrastructure. Further proposals include tax rebates for small businesses as well as easing restrictions on building permits and government contracts particularly with construction and civil engineering.
This is due to the "prime à la casse" program where buyers received a rebate of up to €1,000 for scrapping their polluting old vehicles and purchasing new environmentally friendly/ fuel efficient cars. As a consequence, car sales in France in December 2008 were 30% higher than in December 2007 although on the total 2008 year the sales was down 0.7%. Because the French new cars market fared better than most as well as increased sales in South America, French brands, particularly Renault, now have bigger shares of the world's market despite selling fewer cars in 2008 than in 2007. Another highly exposed industry is naval construction, an order concerning a packet boat for NCL was already cancelled.
In order to fill the blank in the construction planning the French government is expected to order soon a third Mistral BPC, as well as smaller ships, for the French navy to DCNS. This is part of the Sarkozy's rescue plan. DCNS also won its biggest export contract ever when the Brazilian government placed a €7 billion large order to the company. The order concerns four Scorpène class submarine with a conventional propulsion and a fifth one with a nuclear propulsion, as well as a naval shipyard and a naval base.
The French cooperative bank Caisse d'Epargne suffered a €600 million derivatives trading loss in October 2008, which it blamed partly on the high market volatility at the time. The group of employees responsible for making the unauthorised trades were dismissed. French banks have also been affected to some point by the fraud set by Bernard Madoff. Most importantly Natixis, an investment bank, potentially lost €450 million in the process and BNP Paribas could lose €350 million. Neither Natixis or BNP Paribas directly invested in Madoff's but through bonds issued by the US treasury they could face such loses. It is to be determined if all of these are effectively lost, which ones can be recovered and what can be saved by legal procedures. Other groups like AXA, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and Groupama could also face loses to some point.
On 28 September 2008, Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis was partially nationalized with a cash infusion from the Benelux countries amounting to €11.2 billion. Fortis' troubles started in the beginning of the year with an announcement that it faced around $1.5bn of losses in the American sub-prime catastrophe. In June, the company announced a selloff of assets to raise €5 bn to improve the liquidity of the organisation. This, however, proved insufficient. On 6 October 2008, it was announced the French bank BNP Paribas would take over 75 percent of Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66 percent in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder.
However the Belgian government was accused of pressuring shareholders and collapsed over the controversy thus delaying the operation. A new proposition was made on 30 January 2009 with slightly different terms. BNP Paribas would take over 75% of Fortis' banking activities in Belgium and only 10% of the insurance activities in return of what the Belgian government would take 11.7% of BNP Paribas. This agreement would come with a warranty from the Belgian government that it would cover up to €5 billion if more toxic assets were to be discovered. On 30 September 2008 the Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments said they would invest €6.4bn into keeping Dexia, Belgium's second largest bank, afloat.
In May 2008 industrial output fell in the Netherlands by 6 percent.
On 19 March 2009, the INSEE announced worse contraction than previously said, predicting a −2.9% set back of the croissance, and a jobless rate up to 8.8 as soon as June 2009.
Portugal.
In the summer of 2010, Moody's Investors Service cut Portugal's sovereign bond rating down two notches from an Aa2 to an A1. Due to spending on economic stimuli, Portugal's debt had increased sharply compared to the gross domestic product. Moody noted that the rising debt would weigh heavily on the government's short-term finances. Earlier in the year, Portugal was one of the countries identified in the European sovereign-debt crisis as concern spread over increasing government deficit and debt levels in certain countries.
Also in 2010, the country reached a record high unemployment rate of nearly 11%, a figure not seen for over two decades, while the number of public servants remained very high.
International financial markets compelled the Portuguese Government led by Prime Minister José Sócrates, to make radical changes in economic policy, like other European governments had done before. Thus, in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other Eurozone partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for public servants. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact three percent limit.
In November 2010, risk premiums on Portuguese bonds hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to reign in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent – a level the Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions.
A report published in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments had encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This had funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.
On 23 March 2011, José Sócrates resigned following passage of a no confidence motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.
On 6 April 2011, the resigning Prime Minister announced on the television that the country, facing a status of bankruptcy, would request financial assistance to the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, like Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done before.
In order to accomplish the European Union/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's sovereign debt crisis, in July and August 2011, the new government led by Pedro Passos Coelho announced it was going to cut on state spending and increase austerity measures, including public servant wage cuts and additional tax increases.
Rest of Europe.
Denmark showed a contraction of 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2008 following a contraction of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Revised data for Denmark, however cancelled the early recession, as GDP ended at +1.0% in Q4 2007 followed by -1.4% in Q1 2008 and +1.5% in Q2 2008. So according to revised data, the Great Recession only started in Denmark in Q3 2008. Estonia similarly saw an economic contraction of 0.9 percent in the second quarter, following a 0.5 percent contraction in the first quarter, but with the revised data showing no recession before Q3 2008. Latvia's gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent in the second quarter following a fall of 0.3 percent in the first quarter.
Sweden's economy showed zero growth in the second quarter of 2008. The entire economy of the European Union declined by 0.1 percent in the second quarter. A European Commission forecast predicted Germany, Spain and the UK would all enter a recession by the end of the year while France and Italy would have flat growth in the third quarter following second quarter contractions. Economists at Switzerland's second-largest bank predict a recession in 2009.
Chairwoman of the Association of Estonian Food Industry, Sirje Potisepp, warned the Estonian food industry would probably face bankruptcies citing two major beverage companies in Estonia filing for bankruptcy. Ratings agency Fitch warned Ukraine could be headed for a currency crisis as economic fundamentals deteriorate and the country enters another period of political uncertainty. Fitch said the current account deficit was likely to widen further as prices of gas imports rise and prices of its steel exports fall and said Ukraine was likely to need to borrow more at a time when global debt markets have ground to a virtual standstill. Ukraine's central bank chief, Petro Poroshenko, said he saw no need to intervene to protect the currency. Only a few countries retained their high GDP predictions for the year 2008, and can be mentioned Romania and Slovakia. Despite high economic growth in 2008 (8.7%), Romania is touched very hard by the crisis, analysts forecasting a contraction of 8–9% for 2009, as the new government established in the late 2008 is unable to take any anti-crisis measures.
Poland.
Poland is the only member of the European Union to have avoided recession, meaning that in 2009 Poland created the most GDP growth in the EU. As of December 2009 the Polish economy had not entered recession nor contracted, while its International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2010 GDP growth forecast of 1.9 per cent is expected to be upgraded. In the second quarter of 2010, growth was at least 3.1 per cent. As of 30 August 2010, the EU's GDP growth forecast for Poland in 2010 stands at 2.7 per cent, outperforming the EU average of 1 per cent. Poland has one of the lowest external debt rates in the European Union, at just over 320 billion, 46% of its GDP.
Iceland.
The Icelandic króna has declined 40% against the euro during 2008 and has experienced inflation of 14%. Iceland's interest rates have been raised to 15.5% to deal with the high inflation. This loss of currency value has put pressure on banks in Iceland, which are largely dependent on foreign debt. On 29 September 2008 Iceland's Glitnir was effectively nationalized after the Icelandic government acquired 75% of the bank's stock. According to the government the bank "would have ceased to exist" within a few weeks if there had not been intervention.
Iceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde in a television address on 6 October 2008 said credit lines to Icelandic banks had been cut off and that "the Icelandic economy, in the worst case, could be sucked with the banks into the whirlpool and the result could be national bankruptcy" and that the government was looking to other countries for sources of liquidity. Iceland's parliament responded to the crisis by approving a bill giving the Government wideranging powers over the banks, including the ability to seize their assets, force them to merge or compel them to sell off their overseas subsidiaries. The parliament went on to seize control and nationalize Iceland's second largest bank, Landsbanki, on 8 October 2008. The Parliament also extended a £400m loan to the nation's largest bank, Kaupthing, in hopes that it would strengthen the institution's balance sheet.
On 8 October 2008 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the UK government would launch legal action against Iceland, whose government announced that they had no intention of compensating any of the estimated 300,000 UK savers after the nationalization of Landsbanki and its online brand, Icesave. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the UK government would foot the entire bill, estimated at £4bn, and that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki. The following day, Darling used the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 as the basis for seizing the assets of Landsbanki Islands hf, an Iceland-based bank. Icelanders launched an on-line petition drive to protest this action, which is seen as comparing Icelandic banks with Al-Qaida.
Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink at least 10 percent as a result of the crisis, putting Iceland by some measure in an economic depression.
On 27 January 2009 the government collapsed.
Hungary.
On 10 October 2008, the Forint dropped by 10%. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced on 16 October that it was bailing out Hungary with a 5 billion euro (US$6.7 billion) loan facility, just days after the Hungarian Finance Ministry said it was seeking consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about a possible support package. The ECB's unprecedented move in bailing out a non-euro state underlines the crisis unraveling in Hungary and its possible impact on the rest of Central Europe. Several players will be affected, but at particular risk are the Austrian banks which invested so heavily in the region. A potential serious hiccup of the Austrian banks could mark a significant blow to Europe's already troubled banking system.
Hungary, which joined the European Union in 2004, has been hit hard by the current financial crisis due to its heavy dependence on foreign capital to finance its economy and has one of the biggest public deficits in the EU. Prior to the international bailout, the government had feared the worst, including a collapse of the national currency, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány said.
In November Hungary has received a $25 billion cash injection from the International Monetary Fund to save it from financial collapse. In December, the IMF transferred $5 billion and the ECB $2 billion.
Bulgaria.
On 10 June 2009 Bulgarian authorities declared the country was officially in recession with its economy shrinking 4.2 percent from January to June.
United Kingdom.
The economy of the United Kingdom has also been hit by rising oil prices and the credit crisis. Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of Citigroup, said he believes that house prices in Britain will keep falling for another two years. The Ernst & Young Item club predicted growth of only 1.5 percent in 2008, slowing to 1 percent in 2009. They also predicted consumer spending would slow to only 0.2 percent, and forecast a two-year drop in investment. The Institute of Directors’ quarterly business opinion survey showed business optimism at its lowest level since the survey began in 1996.
Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, John Gieve said inflation would accelerate "well over" 4 percent while economic growth is "slowing fast." Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said there may be "an odd quarter or two of negative growth," following the first quarter of 2009. Gieve said he couldn't rule out the UK economy heading into a recession, adding the economy was "quite a long way" from the end of the slowdown.
Nationwide, the UK's biggest building society, warned the UK could head into a recession after house prices in July 2008 fell 8.1 percent from the previous year. Housing prices declined by 1.7 percent in July, double the decline recorded in June. Standard & Poor's said on 30 July 2008 that 70,000 homeowners were in negative equity and it could rise to 1.7 million or about one in six homeowners in the UK based on an expected 17 percent decline into 2009. The Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals fell by a record of nearly 70 percent.
In Northern Ireland, house sales saw a fall of some 50 per cent according to a survey by the University of Ulster/Bank of Ireland and housing prices fell on average by 4 percent. British manufacturing activity declined by the most in almost a decade in July, the third consecutive month of declines.
The number of companies that went into administration in May–July 2008 was 938, an increase of 60 percent compared with the same period in 2007. The number of company liquidations in the second quarter of 2008 rose to 3,689, a 16 percent increase and the highest quarterly figure in five years. House builders expected the number of houses built in 2008 in England and Wales to be the lowest since 1924. The declines were seen as an indication the United Kingdom had a high chance of entering a recession. Factory production in the UK dropped 0.5 percent in June 2008 when twelve out of 13 categories of factory production fell. The economic output of the UK was reported to have increased by just 0.2 percent in the second quarter 2008, the joint-slowest pace since 2001.
The value of sterling relative to other currencies dropped by around 30%.
The Office for National Statistics later gave a revised number saying growth in the British economy was at zero, the worst since the second quarter of 1992. The current slowdown has ended 16 years of continuous economic growth, the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century. A report from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the period from May to July 2008 and 0.2 percent from June to August 2008.
A voter backlash due to the personal financial effects of the global credit crunch was widely attributed by politicians of the United Kingdom Labour Party, which had been in power since 1997, as the reason their political fortunes took a dramatic downturn through May 2008, with a succession of defeats in by-elections and the London Mayoral election, and the worst opinion poll result in their history. Political opponents countered this apparent excuse by pointing to the fact that the incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who had taken office in June 2007 just before the crisis broke, had been the country's 'Iron Chancellor', and had allegedly not ensured the country had sufficient monetary reserves to be able to lower taxes and ease the burden on voters, despite overseeing one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in the country's history. In August 2008 the party also faced calls to impose a windfall tax on the utility companies, who were reaping record profits due to the fuel crisis, perceived as in bad taste given rising food and fuel prices.
On 17 September 2008, news emerged that the banking and insurance group HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) was in merger talks with Lloyds TSB about creating a UK retail banking giant worth £30bn. The move received the backing of the British government which stated that it will over-rule any claims from the competition authorities.
According to the Office for National Statistics unemployment claims in August 2008 increased by 32,500 to reach 904,900. The wider Labour Force Survey measure found joblessness rose by 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the largest increase since 1999.
In September 2008, British bank Bradford & Bingley's £20 billion savings business was acquired by Spanish bank Grupo Santander. While its retail deposit business along with its branch network will be sold to Santander. The mortgage book, personal loan book, headquarters, treasury assets and its wholesale liabilities will be taken into public ownership.
From 1 December 2008, the UK Government made the decision to cut VAT from 17.5% to 15% for 13 months in an attempt to encourage a big spend from UK shoppers before Christmas.
On 4 December 2008, the Bank of England cut interest rates from 3% to 2%, which amounts to the lowest level since 1951.
On 8 January 2009, the Bank of England reduced rates even further, from 2% to 1.5%, the lowest level in the its 315-year history.
On 23 January 2009, Government figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK was officially in recession for the first time since 1991; with a 1.5% fall in gross domestic product during the final quarter of 2008 being the sharpest for 28 years.
On 5 February 2009 interest rates were cut further from 1.5% to 1%.
A February 2009 research on the main British insurers showed that most of them are not considering officially raising insurance premiums for the year 2009, in spite of the 20% raise predictions made by The Daily Telegraph or The Daily Mirror. However, it is expected that the capital liquidity will become an issue and determine increases, having their capital tied up in investments yielding smaller dividends, corroborated with the £644 million underwriting losses suffered in 2007.
On 5 March 2009, the Bank of England cut interest rates yet again, from 1% to 0.5%. The same week, it announced that it would begin a policy of quantitative easing, printing up to £150 billion of new money.
Figures published in March 2009 by the Bank of England revealed that over $1 trillion in foreign holdings had been withdrawn from UK banks between spring and the end of 2008, representing a huge loss of confidence in UK financial institutions.
By November 2008, unemployment had risen to over 1.8 million (compared to just over 1.5 million at the start of the year) and by March 2009 had surpassed 2 million, the highest for 13 years. It was feared that unemployment could surpass 3 million in 2010 – a level not seen since the 1980s. However, the end of the recession in the United Kingdom was declared on 26 January 2010, and the subsequent peak in unemployment has been just over 2.5million.
A report by the ONS produced in March 2009 stated that the UK economy shrank by 1.6 percent during the last quarter of 2008, with a 1% drop in household spending. A further decline of up to 4% GDP during 2009 was predicted.
In April 2009, it was reported that first quarter GDP had shrunk by 1.9 percent, with a prediction of a 4.1 percent drop for the year. The largest contributor to this figure was manufacturing output, which fell by 6.9 percent over the quarter.
In May 2009, Standard & Poor's cut its rating outlook for the UK to negative. Official figures also showed that British public borrowing hit a record high for the month of April, the first month of the new tax year – net public borrowing came in at £8.5bn in April 2009, compared to April 2008's figure of £1.8bn
In June 2009, the figure for the first quarter GDP drop was revised downwards from 1.9 to 2.4 percent, with economic output falling 4.1% from the previous year. Revised figures also showed that the recession began in Q2 of 2008, rather than Q3 of 2008 as previously reported.
In the 3 months to May 2009, the unemployment rate showed a record quarterly rise of 281,000 to stand at 2.38 million – equivalent to 7.6% of the working population. In the three months to June, the number of job vacancies fell to a record low of 429,000, down by 35,000 from the previous quarter.
By the end of June 2009, the public sector debt stood at £798.8 billion, equivalent to 56.6% of GDP, the highest percentage since records began in 1974. This compared to £641.4 billion or 44.4% of GDP in June 2008. The figure is expected to rise still higher when the costs of bailing out RBS and LLoyds Bank are added.
By the start of August 2009, UK unemployment had hit 2.44 million, the highest since 1995. The Bank of England announced that due to the deepening recession in the UK, it would be extending its quantitative easing program to a new total of £175 billion. In November 2009, The Bank of England announced it would be adding a further £25 billion in continuation of quantitative easing in assisting the UK economy through the recession.
In December 2009, it was revealed that the UK's unemployment total was just shy of 2.5 million – another monthly rise and the highest level for 15 years – but the number of people claiming unemployment benefit had actually fallen by more than 6,000. By this stage, the UK was one of the last major economies still in recession. However, on 26 February 2010 it was revealed that the UK economy had grown by 0.3% within the last quarter of 2009 and the UK was out of recession.
However, many economists were still unsure of the situation – the relatively small drop in unemployment benefit claimants could be attributed to seasonal jobs, and with a general election imminent, the government had every reason to present the best economic picture possible. Other factors which could have produced an artificially high growth rate included the end of the "cash-for-clunkers" car replacement scheme, and the ending of a VAT cut from 15% to 17.5% in January causing many consumers to push forward their purchases. In addition, £200 billion had been pumped into the economy via QE, and the central bank rate had been held at almost 0% for most of the year. Thus although official figures showed that the UK had indeed exited recession fears of a double-dip recession remained. According to the IMF, the UK economy had grown slower than that of Portugal or Italy in 2010.
Romania.
Romania's economy has been one of the hardest hit in Europe. The country's trade deficit fell by more than 60 percent during the first half of 2009, but not because of exports taking off, but due to business bankruptcies and unemployment decreasing consumption.
Russia.
From 1999 until the autumn of 2008 Russia's economy grew at a steady pace, which most experts attributed to Putin's policies, a sharp rouble devaluation of 1998, Boris Yeltsin-era structural reforms, rising oil price and cheap credit from western banks. After Vladimir Putin's first term as president (during most of which Mikhail Kasyanov held prime-ministership), some analysts described Russia's short-term economic growth as impressive and maintained that Putin was "at least partially responsible for it": a series of fundamental reforms had been implemented, including a flat income tax of 13 percent, a reduced profits tax, and new land and legal codes.
In October 2008 Russia emerged as one of the countries hardest-hit by the global economic crisis, the stock market crash having been precipitated by Vladimir Putin's verbal attack on Mechel in July that year and Russian peacekeepers' aid to the South Ossetian Republic in August.
In 2008, Russia's benchmark RTS share index lost 72.4 percent, ranking it as an unusual performer of all major emerging markets.
In January 2009, Russia's State Statistics Service released data, according to which the Russian industrial production slumped in December 2008 by 10.3 percent after falling 8.7 percent in November that year.
However, the Russian main stock exchange index has doubled by autumn 2009, compared to the end 2008, and, by the end of 2009, has almost reached the pre-crisis levels.
Sweden.
Sweden has not been severely affected, and no banks or financial institutions have had real trouble. However, some effects have been visible, mostly based on distrust and similar psychological mechanisms. The stockmarket has declined heavily, because of influence from New York and other markets. Some banks, especially Swedbank had invested heavily in US housing bonds.
The banks did not trust each other well and the difference between the interbank interest rate and the state interest rate has gone up at least 1%. The housing loan interest rates have gone up even further. The global sales especially of cars has gone down, forcing the Swedish car industry to lay off staff and contractors. The increased fear of enduring recession and the increased financing costs have lowered company investments and private consumption.
Sweden entered recession after a two consecutive quarter of economic contraction. The Swedish GDP contracted by 0,1% during both the second and third quarters of 2008. Sweden's economy sank into recession in the third quarter of 2008. In October retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in the month, and household consumption fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter. The Riksbank offered 60 billion kronor ($7.71 billion) in loans to financial firms at an auction, after having opened credit facilities to maintain the liquidity in the banking sector. At the beginning of December, the government launched a financial stability package to rev up the economy, while the central bank, urged by the OECD, cut down its interest rates to 2%
Ukraine.
Ukraine was hit heavy by the economic crisis of 2008, analysts say the plights of Ukraine are slumping steel prices, local banking problems and the cutting of Russian gas supply in January 2009. Key industries such as metallurgy and machine building are laying off workers, and real wages have started to fall for the first time in a decade.
Norway.
The Norwegian government pension fund suffered an investment loss of $92 billion during 2008. However, the overall value of the fund rose due to oil sales and currency movements.
European Economic Recovery Plan.
In November 2008, the European Commission presented the European Economic Recovery Plan, In reality, the plan is a series of national measures to be implemented by each government, without much coherency between the policies. The measures included incentives to investment, tax cuts and social measures.
Electromobility.
Electrification of transport (electromobility) figures prominently in the Green Car Initiative (GCI), included in the European Economic Recovery Plan. DG TREN is supporting a large European "electromobility" project on electric vehicles and related infrastructure with a total budget of around €50million as part of the Green Car Initiative.

Ōmura Sumihiro

Biography.
Sumihiro was born at Kushima Castle, the ancestral Ōmura residence in Hizen, as the 10th son of Ōmura Sumiyoshi, the 10th daimyo of Ōmura. When his elder brother, Ōmura Sumiaki became 11th daimyo of Ōmura in 1846, Sumihiro was officially adopted as his son and heir. Sumiaki was sickly, and retired from his duties in December 1846, and Sumihiro became the 12th daimyo of Ōmura on February 21, 1847.
Sumihiro was an active ruler, interested in both "rangaku" and classical learning, and concerned with the direction the country was taking into the unsettled Bakumatsu period. In 1862, he formed an alliance with neighboring Hirado Domain. Sumihiro was considered a strong Tokugawa loyalist, and in 1863 was entrusted with the important position of Nagasaki bugyō, but defected after only a year to become a supporter of the "Sonnō jōi" movement.
During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, he commanded his forces as part of the Satchō Alliance in support of Emperor Meiji, and fought against the Tokugawa remnants of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei in northern Japan.
In June 1868, in return for his loyalty to the new government, the revenues of Ōmura domain were raised to 30,000 "koku." However, with the abolition of the han system later that year, he surrendered his office to the central government and was appointed domain governor until Ōmura domain was absorbed into Nagasaki Prefecture in July 1871.
He was awarded Third Court rank on his deathbed in January 1882, and was posthumously raised to Second Court rank in 1903. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.
His son, Ōmura Sumio was elevated to the rank of viscount ("shishaku") in the new "kazoku" peerage system in 1884, and further elevated to count ("hakushaku") in 1891. However, as he had no son, he adopted his son-in-law, the son of Shimazu Tadahiro to be his heir.

Great Recession in Asia

While beginning in the United States the Great Recession spread to Asia rapidly and has affected much of the region.
East Asia.
Mainland China.
In China, the International Monetary Fund predicts GDP growth for 2008 will be 9.7% and drop to 8.5% in 2009. A struggle was underway to see who would swallow the losses on US Agencies and Treasuries. On November 9, 2008 China announced a package of capital spending plus income and consumption support measures. Four trillion yuan ($586 billion) will be spent on upgrading infrastructure, particularly roads, railways, airports and the power grid; on raising rural incomes via land reform; and on social welfare projects such as affordable housing and environmental protection. So far at least 670,000 small and medium-size enterprises have been closed; leaving mainly the large-size enterprises (which may or may not contain companies who have outsourced their workplaces away from the United States - leaving at least five million people there unemployed).
Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong economy officially slid into recession in the final quarter of 2008. The economy is predicted to grow at 2 percent in 2009. Hong Kong is an advanced tertiary economy built on services, retail, tourism, transport and financial industries. Hong Kong's manufacturing industry is located in Guangdong province which employs over 11 million people. The Hang Seng Index has lost over 60 percent of its value, property market lost over 40 percent in value and unemployment is at a record high of 4.8 percent.
Taiwan.
Taiwan announced billions of dollars in spending and tax cuts due to declining growth and a 26 percent slump in the stock market in 2008. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers raised concerns about global exposure to the assets and stock of Lehman Brothers and the potential for the bankruptcy to cause further tightening of credit. Taiwan, despite reporting few losses from the subprime mortgage crisis, was said to have Lehman-related exposure for its companies and retail investors totaling $2.5 billion. To increase purchasing power, the ROC government has issued the ROC consumer voucher.
Japan.
In Japan exports in June declined for the first time in about five years falling by 1.7 percent. Exports to the United States and European Union fell 15.4 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. The decline in exports and increase in imports cut Japan's trade surplus $1.28 billion a decline of 90 percent from the previous year. An economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland said the decline means the Japanese economy most likely declined in the second quarter. Taro Aso, secretary-general of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, said he believes Japan had entered a recession.
Japan's economy declined by 0.6 percent in the second quarter of 2008. This was later revised to a decline of 0.7 percent. Japanese exports grew 0.3 percent in August 2008 compared to a year before down from 8 percent the previous month. Exports to the U.S. fell 21.8 percent, the biggest decline on record, and exports to Europe fell 3.5 percent. Two Japanese banks appeared on the list of major Lehman creditors. On November 17, the Japanese Economy Minister announced that the nation was officially in a recession.
South Korea.
By September 2008, the crisis threatening the GSEs (US mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) began to have consequences in Asia. The foreign exchange reserves of South Korea's central bank contained many depreciating "Agency bonds" from the GSEs, threatening a currency crisis and leading to depreciation of the South Korean won against the US dollar and other major currencies. Samsung Electronics has been reported to be posting a decrease in sales for the first time since the 1997 Asian financial crisis that home appliances saw a decrease in the domestic market of up to 20 percent since mid-June compared to the previous year. Domestic auto sales also saw a decrease in the second quarter. Auto exports also posted a loss and exports of home appliances were also reported to be in decline.
South East Asia.
Malaysia.
In January 2009, Malaysia has banned the hiring of foreign workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass unemployment amid the global economic crisis.
It was announced that some foreign companies would fire workforce in Malaysia. In 2009 GDP contracted 1.7%.
Philippines.
Unlike the other economies in the region, The Philippines was the only one of a mere handful of countries in the whole world to have recorded a positive economic growth in 2009 and averted the effects of economic recession. However, it did not mean that the country experienced no effect of the on-going world financial crisis. The economy was based on the remittances of the Overseas Filipino Workers, most of them working in affected countries like the United States.
Middle East.
Gulf Co-operation Council.
Booming and then Decreasing oil prices will affect Persian gulf countries.
United Arab Emirates.
Real estate prices in Dubai have decreased substantially.
Lebanon.
Lebanon is one of the only seven countries in the world to have scored profits in 2008. Given the regular security turmoil it has faced in the past, its banks have adopted a conservative approach. The strict regulations imposed by the central bank were crafted to make the Lebanese economy immune to political crisis; and so far, this has applied to the global economic crisis as well. The Lebanese banks remain, under the current circumstances, high on liquidity and reputed for their security.
Moody's has recently shifted Lebanon's sovereign rankings from stable to positive acknowledging its financial security. Moreover, with a Beirut stock market increase of 51%, the index provider MSCI, ranked Lebanon as the world's best performer in 2008. Analysts are, nonetheless, skeptic about the future indirect effects of the crisis, but so far, the direct consequences have proved to be positive.
South Asia.
Bangladesh.
Bangladesh economy is not affected by the global recession. Bangladesh's economic growth and exports remain quite strong.
India.
India's economy benefited from recent high economic growth which declined greatly due to the global economic crisis. Economic growth in India during FY2008-09 stood at 6.7%. The global crisis had less impact of India because exports account for only 15% of India's GDP, less than half the levels of major Asian economic powers such as China and Japan. However, unlike other major Asian economies, India's government finances were in poor shape and as a consequence, it was not able to enact large-scale economic stimulus packages. Despite this, from June 2008 to June 2009, industrial production in India grew by 7.1%.
Though he ended up being wrong, the former Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram once boasted that he expected India's economy to "bounce back" to 9% during FY2009. India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government will take measures to ensure that the economic growth bounces back to 9%. The Asian Development Bank predicted India to recover from weakening momentum in 4-6 quarters. At the G20 Summit, India called for coordinated global fiscal stimulus to mitigate the severity of the global credit crunch. India said that it would inject US$4.5 billion into the financial system to help exporters.
Some analysts pointed that India's growing trade with other Asian countries, especially China, will help reduce the negative impact of the crisis. Analysts also said that India's high domestic demand and large infrastructure projects will act as a buffer reducing the impact of the global downturn on its economy. Economists argued that India's financial system is relatively insulated and its banks do not have significant exposure to subprime mortgage. In an editorial, the "New York Times" praised the strong regulations placed on the Indian banking system by the Reserve Bank of India.
In May 2009, India reported an economic growth rate of 5.8%, beating most forecasts. In second quarter of 2009 the Indian economy grew by 7.9% and gave indications that the Indian economy would scale a growth rate of 7% or above in 2009 and 8-9% in 2010. In the 3rd Quarter of 2010, the economy had bounced back with a growth rate of 8.8%.
Pakistan.
In Pakistan the central bank's foreign currency reserves, when counting forward liabilities is said to only amount to as little as $3 billion, sufficient for a single month of imports. Corruption and mismanagement have combined with high oil prices to damage Pakistan's economy. Pakistan's rupee has lost more than 21 per cent of its value in 2008 and inflation is at 25 per cent. The government has failed to defer payments for Saudi oil or raise favorable loans. President Asif Ali Zardari claimed Pakistan needed a bailout worth $100 billion which he was expected to ask for at a meeting in Abu Dhabi in November. Ratings agency Standard and Poor's rates Pakistan's sovereign debt at CCC +, only a few ratings above the default level, warning the country may be unable to cover about $3 billion in upcoming debt payments.
This led a change in economic managers,and politically elected finance minister Naveed Qamar was replaced by a financial advisor, Shaukat Tareen, a former banker belonging to Citigroup on October 8, 2008. The new finance advisor led the Pakistani delegation to IMF-World Bank meeting in USA with a hope to obtain a loan from the World Bank which has been stopped now due to reservations from IMF on World Bank for releasing this nature of Loan to any country.
the situation in the Pakistan is seems to be revealed to progress. as in the budget for 2013-2014 taxes has been implemented to recover the income of the government through masses.
Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka too is affected with the global recession, as the demand for their major products such as garments, tea, rubber, coconut based products and agricultural products are at a downturn. At the moment, tea is severely affected and the country is experiencing 35% drop in the exports presently. Also, the tourist industry has downsized; last year, there was a 7% downsize to the industry, primarily due to the loss of European tourists.

Great Recession in the Americas

North America was one of the focal points of the global, Great Recession. While Canada has managed to return their economy nearly to the levels they enjoyed prior to the recession, the United States and Mexico are still under the influence of the worldwide economic slowdown. The cost of staple items dropped dramatically in the United States as a result of the recession.
North America.
U.S..
The United States entered 2008 during a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a 5-year record. In September, 159,000 jobs were lost, bringing the monthly average to 84,000 per month from January to September 2008.
Canada.
Canada was one of the last industrialized nations to enter into a downturn. GDP growth was negative in Q1, but positive in Q2 and Q3 of 2008. The recession officially started in Q4. The almost 1-year delay of the start of the recession in Canada relative to the U.S. is largely explained by two factors. First, Canada has a strong banking sector not weighed-down by the same degree of consumer-related debt issues that existed in the United States. The United States economy collapsed from within, while the Canadian economy was being hurt by its trade relationship with the United States. Second, commodity prices continued to rise through to June 2008, supporting a key component of the Canadian economy and delaying the start of recession. In early December 2008, the Bank of Canada, in announcing that it was lowering its central bank interest rate to the lowest level since 1958, also declared that Canada's economy was entering in recession. The Bank of Canada has since announced that it has two consecutive months of GDP decline (Oct -0.1% & Nov -0.7%). The country's unemployment rate could rise to 7.5% in the next two years, according to the latest OECD report.
On July 23, 2009, the Bank of Canada officially declared the recession to be over in Canada. However, the true economic recovery did not begin until November 30, 2009. The Canadian economy would expand at an annualized rate of 6.1% in the first quarter (January–April) of 2010, surpassing analyst expectations and marking the best growth rate since 1999. Economists had expected annualized GDP growth of 5.9% in the last quarter, up from 5% in last year's fourth quarter (September–December 2009). The growth in the first quarter is the third straight quarter of economic expansion in Canada, coming on the heels of three consecutive quarters of contraction. March growth came in at 0.6%, ahead of the 0.5% estimate. 215,900 new jobs have been created in the winter and early spring months of 2010 alone - in the traditional period of time where the Canadian economy is at its most stagnant.
Even with the steps taken to create jobs in the Canadian economy, its recovery remains fragile and job cuts can still be seen in areas that specialize in manual labor.
Mexico.
Despite the solid financial system of Mexico, the effects of the financial crisis originated in the United States impacted Mexico's export sector by a significant amount considering that 85% of the country's exports go to the United States. Reduced demand, the highest unemployment rate in almost a decade and the depreciation of the Mexican peso caused analysts to revise growth estimates officially from 1.8% to somewhere closer to 0% for 2008.
The recession did not show up until 2009, but the recession already slowed down in 2008. The country had a positive growth of 1.5% in 2008 compared to a 3.3% in 2007, by 2009 the economy had shrunk by 6.5%, a percentage bigger than that of the 1994-1995 crisis and the largest in almost eight decades and registering an inflation of 3.57%
Economic recovery from the historic downturn started in the late 2009 with exports rising 22.8 percent. The economic prospects for 2010 in the early 2009 were of a positive growth of 3.5 and some saw a steady recovery by the second quarter of 2010. At the end of 2010, the OECD revealed an estimated growth of 4.5 percent while the Mexican government estimated a growth of over 5 percent and the creation of 730 thousand jobs.
The estimated growth for 2011 range from 3.9 to 4.8. Despite the sustained growth in 2010, it was not enough to cover up the loss of 2009.
South America.
As it mainly consists of commodity exporters, South America was not directly affected by the financial turmoil, even if the bond markets of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela have been hit.
On the other hand, the continent experienced a tough agricultural crisis at the beginning of 2008. Food prices have increased a lot, due to a lack of arable land. One of the main reasons for the loss of agricultural land was the high value offered by the production of biofuels. Food prices, rising since 2002, ascended from 2006, reaching a peak during the first quarter of 2008. In one year the average price of food rose by about 50%.
Then South American countries were affected by both the global slowdown and the decrease in food prices due to the declining demand. In June 2008, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) declared it expected a 4% growth for 2009. However at the end of the year it predicted that the year 2009 would put an end to six years of prosperity during which Latin America has benefited from high raw materials prices. Production in the region is likely to decline and unemployment to increase. However, the Center for Economic and Policy Research has estimated that the region may be able to cope with the global downturn with the right macro-economic policies, as these countries no longer depend on the U.S. economy.

Allison Harvard

Allison Elizabeth Harvard (born January 8, 1988) is an American model, artist, actress, and Internet celebrity, best known as the runner-up of both cycle 12 of "America's Next Top Model" and "America's Next Top Model: All-Stars". Harvard has appeared on the cover of magazines such as ONE, WeTheUrban, and one of the Philippine's leading fashion megazines, "Mega".
Early life.
Harvard was born in Houston, Texas and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. She attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge before transferring to the University of New Orleans, where she studied art during the spring semester. Her artwork is featured in the 2007 novel "The Story Told at Night" by Liza Kuznetsova.
In 2005, before her appearance on "America's Next Top Model", Harvard gained notoriety as an Internet meme on 4chan, where she became known as Creepy Chan.
Career.
"America's Next Top Model".
After being contacted through email by a casting agent who had seen her look online, Harvard successfully auditioned for cycle 12 of "America's Next Top Model". During the audition process, Harvard stated that she thought nosebleeds were pretty, and that she was fascinated by blood.
Harvard was called first by Tyra Banks four times, in episodes two, ten, twelve and thirteen (the first part of the finale). Harvard was in the bottom two twice. In episode four, she landed in the bottom two with contestant Nijah Harris because she was said to have over-analyzed her shoot. In episode seven, she landed in the bottom two with contestant Tahlia Brookins because of her lackluster commercial and her one-dimensional look, leading the judges to question her versatility.
During the finale episode of "America's Next Top Model", Harvard gave a convincing CoverGirl commercial and was hailed for her improvement from the previous commercial. In the final runway walk, Harvard was deemed the most improved despite being deemed the worst walker out of the bunch at the beginning of the competition. Despite her improvements and strong look, Harvard lost the competition to Teyona Anderson, making Harvard the runner-up.
In 2011, Harvard participated in cycle 17 of "America's Next Top Model", the first "All-Stars" edition of the show, where she was the runner-up for a second time.
Like all the other contestants on Cycle 17, Harvard was given a branding word: "unique". During her time on the show she developed her own perfume called "Honey Blood" and performed in a music video for her song "Underwater".
After "America's Next Top Model".
In June 2009, Harvard signed with the Los Angeles-based Nous Model Management, but is no longer included on the agency's current roster. Since "America's Next Top Model", Harvard has modeled for KarmaLoop.com, walked at the 2012 New York Fashion Week for Gemma Kahng and Malan Breton, and was featured in a spread for ONE Magazine. She has also modeled for Chromat and Richie Rich.
In June 2009, she made an Internet video with fourfour titled "Fake Blood", and was "interviewed" by Winston, the resident cat at fourfour. Harvard is the face of Michael Cinco's "Impalpable" perfume, with international male model Tierry Vilson and walked in the Philippine Fashion Week 2012 with fellow "All-Stars" contestant Dominique Reighard in the Michael Cinco and Rajo Laurel for Bench fashion shows. Harvard was on the cover of the fifth issue of online publication WeTheUrban. In mid-2012, she appeared in promotional photos for G Fine Body Art, a beauty brand that is set to launch glittery body art services at salons and spas starting later in fall 2012.
In celebration of Bench's twenty-fifth anniversary, Harvard walked the runway at Bench Universe: The 2012 Denim & Underwear Show in September 2012, along with Reighard and this time with "America's Next Top Model, Cycle 18" winner Sophie Sumner.

He moved to Torquay United in October 1982, making his debut at left-back in place of Mark Smith in the 3–1 win at home to Northampton Town on 16 October. He played 19 league games before being released at the end of the season. He returned to Australia and rejoined Blacktown City, regularly being shortlisted for PFA Players of the Season.
In February 1986, O'Donnell returned to the UK and joined Bath City. He played regularly for Bath until leaving in May 1987 when he joined Basingstoke Town.

Phoebe Washburn

Phoebe Washburn (born 1973) is an American installation artist who lives and works in New York.Washburn is best known for producing large-scale installations: assemblages of garbage, detritus, cardboard, scrap wood, and, more recently, organic matter such as sod or plants.
Career.
She holds a BFA from Tulane University and an MFA from School of Visual Arts. Her work has been exhibited around the world at Institute of Contemporary Art 2007, Deutsche Guggenheim 2007 and Whitney Biennial 2008. She is represented by Zach Feuer Gallery in New York.
Washburn is a process-based artist. She creates installations with help of assistants, due to the colossal size and labor-intensive methods she requires. Processes are architectural in nature including stacking, blinding, nailing, etc. The pieces tend to look organic, mirroring the processes, but also have that haphazard, precarious appeal as they are often stacked up with chairs or other props. The overall resulting work is reliant on the gallery space. Washburn dubs this 'spontaneous architecture' and continues by adding:
"My sculptures depend a lot on the spaces where they are shown because they often are anchored into the wall but chance is definitely more of a factor in the final product than is any predetermined design. I just let the structures evolve by repeating the same action again and again. The process has a slightly neurotic element in that it involves adding little behavior habits. As silly as it sounds, I often feel as if my assistants and I are beavers building a dam. The shapes are less about form than they are about the activity involved in amassing and assembling the forms."
A sample installation, "Vacational Trappings and Wildlife Worries" (exhibited during the summer of 2007 at Philadelphia's Institute of Contemporary Art) involved the creation of a "barrel-vaulted walkway made from hundreds of scrap-wood pieces" featuring several niches containing water, shrimp, snails, aquatic plants, and small objects, yiedling what Washburn called a 'poor man's aquarium'. 
An earlier work, "Heavy Has Debt", (exhibited in 2003 in Grinnell, Iowa), was a "massive, shingled wall of debris," produced largely from mounted cardboard.

2005 Holden Performance Driving Centre V8 Supercar Series

The 2005 Holden Performance Driving Centre V8 Supercar Series was an Australian touring car series held for V8 Supercars. It was the sixth series held for second tier V8 Supercar teams. The season began on 18 March 2005 at Wakefield Park and finished on 27 November at Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. The season consisted of seven rounds held across four different states. The series was expanded for 2005, incorporating the previously stand-alone support race at Bathurst 1000 into a series round and adding a finale on the support program of the Bigpond Grand Finale.
Dean Canto, driving for Dick Johnson Racing's two car team, dominated the expanded series, winning ten races, and five of the seven rounds, which made Canto the first multiple-champion of the series and directly led to a full-time return to V8 Supercar Championship Series with Garry Rogers Motorsport. Series runner up Paul Cruickshank Racing driver Warren Luff failed to score a win, staying in touch with Canto through consistency. Adam Macrow was the other multiple race-winner, taking victory four times, but some unlucky results saw him finish fourth in the points race behind Gary MacDonald. Shane Beikoff, Lee Holdsworth and Dale Brede took the remaining wins with Race 2 at Bathurst declared a no result after a multi-car collision blocked the track after just six laps.
Teams and drivers.
The following teams and drivers have competed during the 2005 Holden Performance Driving Centre V8 Supercar Series.
Results and standings.
The season consisted of seven rounds across four different states. Rounds 2-5 consisted of three races. The second race of each weekend saw the finishing order of race 1 reversed to form the grid, a 'reverse grid' race. Rounds 1, 6 and 7 consisted of a pair of races. Points were awarded for all cars who finished each race in finishing order. Points may have been offered beyond the 24th position but at no point during the season did more than 24 cars finish a race. Round 2's pair of races carried 50% more points than a single race elsewhere in the season.

Sir Richard Neave, 1st Baronet

Sir Richard Neave, 1st Baronet (22 November 1731 – 28 January 1814) was a British merchant and a Governor of the Bank of England.
Life.
Neave was the son of James Neave and Susanna Trueman. He developed considerable interests in the West Indies and the Americas and was chairman at various times of the Ramsgate Harbour Trust, the Society of West Indian Merchants and the London Dock Company, as well as a director of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Neave was a friend of George Read of Delaware who wrote to warn him in 1765 that the British government's attempts to tax the colonies without giving them direct representation in Parliament would lead to independence.
Neave lived in Bower House in Havering-atte-Bower but sought to elevate himself from merchant to country gentleman and purchased Dagnam Park in 1772. Neave had the original Dagnams demolished, probably between 1772 and 1776 and replaced by a red-brick Georgian house nine bays wide by four deep with a curved central three-bay projection to the south front. He was a director of the Bank of England for 48 years, made Deputy Governor in 1781 and Governor from 1783 to 1785. In 1794 he was appointed High Sheriff of Essex. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and in 1785 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was created a baronet on May 13, 1795.
Family.
Neave married Frances Bristow in 1761. He and his wife were painted, in a double portrait, by Thomas Gainsborough around 1765 (private collection). Their daughter Frances married Beeston Long; in 1806, both Neave and Long served as Vice-presidents of the London Institution.
The second daughter Catherine Mary married Henry Howard.

John T. Hudson (1811 - April 16, 1887) was an American politician from New York.
Life.
He lived in Buffalo, New York.
In November 1846, he was elected on the Democratic and Anti-Rent tickets a canal commissioners. Under the Act of May 6, 1844, there were two canal commissioners to be elected to a four-year term beginning on February 1, 1847, but at the same State election the voters ratified the New York State Constitution of 1846 which extended the terms of the incumbent commissioners until the end of 1847, calling for a new election in November 1847. Thus Hudson could not take office for his elected term. However, shortly before the State election, Commissioner Jonas Earll, Jr. had died, and Hudson was appointed on December 3, 1846, by Governor Silas Wright to fill the vacancy and remained in office until the end of 1847.
In 1854, he was appointed by President Franklin Pierce Collector of Customs at Buffalo.

Commercial Slip

Buffalo, New York's Commercial Slip is a re-excavated and restored portion of the western terminus of the Erie Canal. The area is located in the Erie Canal Harbor development and is adjacent to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park.
History.
The Slip was a remnant of Little Buffalo Creek, which flowed into the Buffalo River just before the larger stream entered Lake Erie. The Commercial Slip formed one boundary of Buffalo's infamous Canal District, and was filled in when the district was marked for urban renewal in the 1950s. By that time, the New York State Thruway and the Skyway had been built over the Canal district, and the Commercial Slip was buried and forgotten.
Rebirth.
In the late 1990s, public authorities began showing an interest in reviving Buffalo’s Erie Canal heritage. Initially, plans called for re-creating some buried elements of the Canal. However a public outcry, with pressure from citizens’ groups and the local media, convinced the planners to excavate and restore actual portions of the district, including the Commercial Slip. 
Completed in 2008, Phase 2 of inner harbor plan laid out by the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation consisted of:

Today, the Slip is a vibrant focal point on Buffalo’s waterfront, offering a look back into the City’s storied Canal Street days.

Alvis Pelides

The Alvis Pelides was an unflown British air-cooled radial aero engine first developed in 1936. The Pelides Major was a projected but unbuilt development as were the Alcides, Alcides Major and the Maeonides Major, the Alvis aircraft engine range taking their names from Greek mythology.
Design and development.
The Pelides was the first aero engine of Alvis design, the company had previously built the French Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major under license. With the two companies working closely together the 14 cylinder radial layout of this engine retained metric dimensions but substituted metric screw threads with British fasteners such as BSF and Whitworth. Material specifications were different as were the detail design of internal parts such as the crankpin. The Pelides passed a 50 hour Air Ministry type test in 1937 where it produced 1,065 hp (794 kW) but no aircraft application was found and only 15 engines were built. The onset of the Second World War caused the abandonment of any further development of the Pelides and its related designs.
Variants (projected).
Pelides Major.
The Pelides Major was a projected but unbuilt version retaining the same dimensions as the Pelides but with improvements to the supercharger.
Alcides and Alcides Major.
The Alcides of 1937 was another projected medium supercharged two row radial engine but was planned to have 18 cylinders with a displacement of 3,314 cu in (54.24 L) and a power output of 1,300 hp (969 kW). Again the Alcides Major was an improved fully supercharged version.
Maeonides Major.
Also designed in 1937 was the unbuilt supercharged Maeonides Major, effectively a smaller version of the Pelides with a displacement of 1,158 cu in (19 L) and a power output of 650 hp (485 kW).

Great Recession in Africa

As a direct result of the late 2000s recession, some economies in Africa have been primarily affected by reduced global demand and lower prices of commodities such as oil, platinum, nickel, gold, and copper. South Africa was the first African country to fall in recession. Other countries like Morocco and Egypt, which benefited from their previous high economic growth experienced a great decline due to the global economic crisis without falling in recession.
South Africa.
Moody's Investors Service warned on July 7, 2008 that South Africa could slip into a recession by the turn of the year. Moody's cited electricity shortages, high interest rates, soaring inflation, a slumping housing and vehicle market and lower business and consumer confidence indicators. Growth in South Africa's real gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2008 slowed to 0.39%. CPIX inflation, the monetary-policy inflation target measure, rose 10.9% on a year-on-year basis in May, its highest level since November 2002. South Africa's National Treasury criticized the statement by Moody's saying, "It's not possible that we'll end up in recession." He added that the government may revise lower its 4 percent growth forecast for the year following growth of 5.1% in 2007. Car sales in South Africa dropped an annual 22 percent in June due to higher interest rates.

The Potomac Handicap was an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in the latter part of September at Havre de Grace Racetrack in Havre de Grace, Maryland. Open to three-year-old horses, it was raced on dirt at a distance of a mile-and-a-sixteenth.
First run at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, it was restricted to two-year-olds and run at a distance of one mile. The 1918 running was won by Calumet Farm's two-year-old colt, Be Frank, ridden by Lavelle Ensor. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3D61539E13ABC4850DFB6678383609EDE] The following year the race moved to the Havre de Grace Racetrack and was changed to an event for three-year-olds and set at a distance of a mile-and-a-sixteenth. 
The Potomac Handicap was won by four National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame inductees including 1919 U.S. Triple Crown winner Sir Barton and Man o' War who won the 1920 edition. Despite being assigned highweight of 138 pounds, Man o' War set a new Havre de Grace track record for a mile-and-a-sixteenth.

Rock Ethos

Rock Ethos Launched in 2008, is an annual rock music festival which aims to promote anti-piracy. The festival’s mission also revolves around encouraging bands to present original songs instead of cover versions. Indian rock bands are allocated 45 minutes to perform their original compositions at the festival. In an attempt to recreate an international rock festival experience, Rock Ethos offers a carnival atmosphere with bungee jumping, paintball contests, and food and refreshment zones serving as added attractions.
Rock Ethos 2008.
Venue: Palace Grounds, Bangalore
Date: Sunday, 10 February 2008
Time: 11am to 10pm
The day-long, entry-free rock carnival had India’s 13 biggest rock bands performing back-to-back for 45 minutes each. The three-dimensional stage had two huge 14 feet guitars and two kick drums with a diameter of eight feet as stage backdrop. The bands did their tuning in the green room from where they could directly step up to the main stage and start playing instead of doing the tuning on the main stage and annoying the audience. There were well-established old metal heads such as Mother Jane to the relatively new, nevertheless talented bands, including Inviktus. Dispelling all myths about low-energy levels in original Indian Metal compositions, college bands such as Illuminati displayed remarkable screen presence and technical expertise. While Bhoomi lived up to all expectations with old-school metal numbers “Uncultured” and “Dead Time Stories”; Mother Jane, the closing act, delivered a tight performance with some fantastic classical stunts woven into the lead guitar pieces, thereby performing the perfect swan song to a memorable evening. Almost all performers lauded the fact that Rock Ethos was the first to ever encourage them to play their original compositions.
Rock Ethos 2009.
Venue: Palace Grounds, Bangalore
Date: 14 & 15 March 2009
Time: 11am to 10pm
Rock Ethos, the first ever Indian metal fest featured original rock music of Bangalore has been unanimously hailed as 'one day indigenous India's Woodstock'. Descending on delirious rock fans in all its electrifying impact, it stirred up India’s rock scene into a blaze of frenzy that left the city asking for more.
Venturing into unexplored territory of showcasing exclusively original rock music, the event proved to be a smash hit as proved by the huge crowd that thronged Palace Grounds for the 10-hour Indian rock cornucopia.
Rock Ethos ’09 keeps the spirit of rock flying high with a two-day festival replete with double the number of rock bands. Stage effects, lighting and sound will reach for hitherto un-scaled heights, in keeping with the promise of creating a memorable impact each consecutive season. In no way subjacent to an international rock fest, Rock Ethos 09 ushers in an energetic mood, refreshing spirits jaded with negativism of recent times.

Great Recession in Oceania

Australia.
Australia avoided technical recession due to a number of factors: the country's low levels of public debt allowed government stimulus spending; its proximity to the booming Chinese economy and the related mining boom kept growth ticking over throughout the worst of the global conditions. In fact, sources such as the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia had predicted Australia was well positioned to weather the crisis with minimal disruption, sustaining more than 2% GDP growth in 2009 (as many Western nations went into recession). In the same year the World Economic Forum ranked Australia's banking system the fourth best in the world, while the Australian dollar's 30% drop was seen as a boon for trade, shielding the country from the crisis and helping to slow growth and consumption.
Some analysts had predicted the continuing decline of trade in 2009 could put the economy into recession for the first time in 17 years. However these initial fears were proved largely unfounded as the Australian economy avoided recession and the unemployment rate peaked at a much lower rate than had been predicted.
New Zealand.
New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's quarterly survey showing New Zealand's economy contracted 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2008 and Treasury figures suggested the economy also contracted in the June quarter putting New Zealand in a technical recession. The Treasury says the economy could recover in the second half of the year under the impact of high dairy prices boosting farmer incomes and cuts to personal tax rates, which come into effect on Oct. 1. About 23 financial companies in New Zealand have filed for bankruptcy in a year. Housing starts in New Zealand fell 20 percent in June, the lowest levels since 1986. Excluding apartments, approvals dropped 13 percent from May. Approvals in the year ended June fell 12 percent from a year earlier. Second-quarter approvals dropped 19 percent. The figures suggest a decrease in construction and economic growth. House sales fell 42 percent in June from a year earlier. The New Zealand Treasury concluded that the country's economy had contracted for a second quarter based on economic indicators, putting New Zealand in a recession. New Zealand's central bank cut rates by half a percent arguing the economy was in recession. New Zealand's GDP declined by 0.2 percent in the second quarter putting the country in its first recession in a decade.
The economy emerged from recession in mid-2009, with the second-quarter GDP report showing the economy grew by 0.1 per cent on the March quarter.

Palácio das Laranjeiras

The Palácio das Laranjeiras () is the official residence of the Governor of the State of the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The palace is located within Guinle Park, a park in the Laranjeiras neighbourhood of the city of Rio de Janeiro.
Formerly the residence of one of the wealthiest Brazilian families, the palace was purchased by the Brazilian Federal Government in 1947 to host visitors, such as foreign Heads of State or Heads of Government. At that time, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil. In 1974, the Federal Government ceded ownership of the palace to the State of Rio de Janeiro.
Before becoming the official residence of the State Governor, the Palace was a Presidential Residence. Its use as an official residence of the President began in the Presidency of Jucelino Kubitschek, who opted to only use the seat of the presidency, Catete Palace, as a workplace. President Kubitschek used Laranjeiras Palace as his main residence until the transfer of the Federal Capital to Brasília.
From the transfer of the seat of the Government to the new Capital City of Brasília in 1960 until 1974, when it was ceded to the Rio de Janeiro State Government, Laranjeiras Palace remained an official palace of the Presidency of the Republic, for use as a residence and workplace of the Nation's chief executive when the President was in Rio de Janeiro. During the first decade after the founding of Brasília it was very common for presidents to travel to Rio de Janeiro and to spend a considerable amount of time in the city. Although no longer the Capital, in the 1960s Rio de Janeiro was still home to all foreign embassies, and the city of Brasília was not regarded as a good place to live, as many services had not yet been established in the new Capital. Therefore, during the sixties, several important official acts of Government took place in Laranjeiras Palace. In the 70's, however, use of the Palace by the presidency declined as the city of Brasília grew, leading to the decision by the Federal Government to hand over the palace to the State Government of Rio de Janeiro.

Vern Mullen

Vern Elmo Mullen (February 27, 1900 - September 14, 1980) was a professional football player from Taylorville, Illinois.
College scandal.
After high school, Mullen split his college time between the University of Illinois and West Virginia Wesleyan College. In 1921, Mullen served as a ringer for his hometown Taylorville team against a team from rivial Carlinville, who was also using ringers from Notre Dame. He left college to play in the game with nine other Illinois players. Taylorville's plan was to use its regular team in the first half and substitute the Illinois players in the second half. However Mullen, being a hometowner, would play the entire game. After two scorelss quarters, Mullen broke through the line to block a Carlinville punt and returned it 50 yards to the Carlinville two-foot-line. This later set up a score. Taylorsville would go on to win the game 16-0 and an estimated $50,000-$100,000 in winnings. The game was well-publicized, however the college players' participation wasn't revealed until late January 1922. The nine Illinois players were banned from further intercollegiate competition. The eight Notre Dame players were expelled from school. This incident led to a revision of the eligibility rules and codes in the Big Ten Conference and the appointment of a full-time commissioner.
Pro football.
Mullen made his NFL in 1923 with the Canton Bulldogs, where he helped the team win the NFL Championship. He then played for the Chicago Bears from 1924 until 1926, before traveling crosstown to play for the Chicago Cardinals. He finished his career with the Pottsville Maroons in 1927.

Walter of Albano

Walter of Albano or Gualterio (died 1101) was the cardinal-bishop of the Diocese of Albano in Italy from 1091 to 1101. He served as papal legate to England in May 1095, where he secured the recognition of Pope Urban II by King William II of England. He also brought a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to the newly elected Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury.
Early career.
Walter was appointed a cardinal by Urban in 1091 and was one of Urban's supporters in the papal curia.
In 1095 the papacy was disputed between two claimants, Clement III and Urban. King William had not recognized either, but Anselm, prior to his election as archbishop, had recognized Urban, and wished to go to Urban to receive his pallium. William would not allow Anselm to go to Rome nor acknowledge any pope until the king had chosen which pope to recognize, and called the Council of Rockingham to persuade Anselm to wait, but the council did not settle matters to the king's satisfaction. In order to resolve the situation without relinquishing his royal right to choose the pope acknowledged by England, the king sent two clerks to Rome to negotiate with Urban about English recognition and the pallium for Anselm. They set out after the Council in February 1095, and returned to England with Walter by 13 May 1095.
Legate in England.
Walter did not meet with Anselm when he landed at Dover, instead going directly to meet the king. Walter was authorized to give the king "all that he wanted" in return for William's recognition of Urban. The king's chief negotiator was William de St-Calais, the Bishop of Durham. The medieval writer Hugh of Flavigny said that Walter expressly conceded that no more papal legates would be sent to England without William's permission, for the length of William's life. Papal approval of the king's acts in the dispute was also granted. William then attempted to get the legate to depose Anselm, but was unsuccessful. Hugh also accused Walter of taking a bribe and attempting to get Anselm to swear fealty to the pope and Saint Peter. In the end, a compromise was reached, which limited the ability of the papacy to interfere in the English Church in exchange for the king's recognition of Urban.
When time came to give Anselm his pallium, the first suggestion that the king give it to Anselm was rejected by the archbishop, and a compromise was reached where Walter put the pallium on the high altar at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 May 1095, and Anselm took the pallium from the altar. Walter remained in England to collect Peter's Pence, a traditional payment from the English bishoprics to the papacy. Anselm and the legate did not get along well from the start, for Walter said that Anselm's election as archbishop had been made by schismatics, throwing doubt on Anselm's fitness. Relations between Walter and Anselm were further strained later in the summer when the legate wrote a letter to Anselm relaying some accusations against the archbishop made by some of the English bishops. Although Walter attempted to discuss church reform with Anselm, Anselm gave the excuse that because an invasion from Robert Curthose was expected, the archbishop was unable to talk with the legate due to Anselm's military obligations. Another reason Anselm gave was that nothing could be done about a church council in England without the king's approval.
Later career.
Walter left England sometime in the summer or autumn of 1095. He took with him to Rome a letter from Anselm and a small gift for Urban. He was in Rome on 14 August 1099, and probably helped elect Pope Pascal II on 13 August 1099. He died in 1101.

Pavia Cathedral

The Cathedral of Pavia () is a church in Pavia, Italy, the largest in the city and seat of the Diocese of Pavia. The construction was begun in the 15th century on the site of two pre-existing Romanesque, "twin" cathedrals (Santo Stefano and Santa Maria del Popolo). The cathedral houses the remains of St. Sirus, first Bishop of Pavia, and a thorn from the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ.
The marble facing of the exterior was never completed. Until recently, next to the cathedral stood the Civic Tower (Torre Civica), known in 1330 and enlarged in 1583. It collapsed on March 17 1989.
History.
The cathedral was begun in 1488 under architect Cristoforo Rocchi, soon replaced by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo and Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono. The original project, with a nave and two aisles flanked by semicircular niches and a large central dome, was influenced by Bramante, some details of it later appearing in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Also Leonardo da Vinci is known to have contributed to the project.
In 1521 the altar area was completed by a pupil of Da Vinci, named Gianpietrino Rizzi. By the 17th century, the presbytery had been completed but only in the following century was the tambour built, while the dome itself and the facade had to wait for the 19th century. The dome was designed by Carlo Maciachini and completed in 1885, but partially collapsed that same year. In the 1930 the construction continued with the two arms of the transept, for which the original plan was followed, although using reinforced concrete (in order to save the remains of the medieval Santa Maria del Popolo). The arms are still missing part of the internal marble decoration.
Overview.
The church is on the Greek Cross plan: it therefore has the same length and width at the transept (c. 84 m). Such size 
makes it one of the largest edifices with central plan in northern Italy.
The central dome, with an octagonal plan, is 97 m tall, with a total weight of some 20,000 tons. It is the fourth in Italy in size, after St. Peter's Basilica, the Pantheon and the Cathedral of Florence.

José Antonio Saravia, José Antonio Sarabia, (Villanueva del Fresno, Spain, 1785 - Resident in Russia since about 1812 - General of the Russian Army 1843 - Kamianets-Podilskyi, now in Ukraine, 2 April 1871), was General Inspector of the Russian Military Academies under the Tsars Nikolai I and Alexander II. He married at Kremenetz, now Kamianets-Podilskyi, Larisa Ivanovna, losing there three children and his wife. 
It seems he got another younger brother or half brother named Manuel José Saravia y Perdigos, Manuel José Sarabia y Perdigos, (Oliva de Jerez, Spain, 1790–1852) who fought also in Spain after the age of 18, against Napoleon after 1808, became a lieutenant in a Spanish Naval Expedition in Napoleonic Denmark, the same than his brother, being also integrated as his brother in the Russian Army after Borodino battle as his brother in 1812, became a General of the Russian Army in 1824, aged 34, under Tsar Alexander I, Emperor of Russia from 1801 to 1825, much earlier than that José Antonio, and is reported as dying in 1852, much earlier also than his elder brother/half brother José Antonio. 
Curiously enough, Oliva de Jerez, where Manuel José was born and Villanueva del Fresno where José Antonio was born, both in the Province of Badajoz, near Olivenza, are nearby and there is a gap of only 5 years between both persons.
It seems that the second name of José Antonio was also Perdigos, but we know mostly about rumours mentioning him as born of a single mother and being adopted by his grand parents, named Perdigos.

Bhubing Rajanives Palace (, ; also spelled "Phuping" or "Phuphing") is a Royal Residence located Doi Buak Ha, Muang District, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. It was built in 1961 to accommodate the royal family during state visits to the north of the country. There is also a guesthouse for receiving foreign dignitaries. It is built in the mountains overlooking Chiang Mai, to take advantage of the cool mountain air. The rose gardens are particularly famous (Suan Suwaree), and many flowers are grown here that could not otherwise be grown in Thailand.
The palace was built in central Thai architectural style called “Ruean Mu” (Group of Houses). The building sits on stilts. The upper floor is the royal residential area while the ground floor houses the royal entourage. The building master plan was designed by Prince Samaichalerm Kridagara while the building was designed by Mom Rachawongse Mitrarun Kasemsri. The construction of the Palace was undertaken by the Crown Property Bureau, under the supervision of Prince Samaichalerm Kridagara, assisted by Mom Rachawongse Mitrarun Kasemsri and Mr.Pradit Yuwapukka. General Luang Kampanath Saenyakorn, the Privy Councilor was assigned to lay foundation stones on 24 August 1961 at 10:49 hrs.
The construction took 5 months to complete. The first royal visitors to stay at the Palace were King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark on their royal visit to Thailand in January 1962

Beck – Levande begravd () is a 2009 film about the Swedish police detective Martin Beck directed by Harald Hamrell.
It is the 26th film in the series of chief inspector Martin Beck, with Peter Haber in the role of Beck and Mikael Persbrandt as Gunvald Larsson. It is directed by Harald Hamrell. The producer is Lars Blomgren and production company is Filmlance. Recording began in September 2008. In the movie is also Stina Rautelin, Ingvar Hirdwall, Måns Nathanaelson, Rebecka Hemse and Jessica Zandén.
Plot.
In a playground in the centre of the urban idyll, the police find a buried wooden box containing a famous and well-respected prosecutor. Martin Beck and his police team initially suspect a highly criminal MC-leader of the attack, but one pretty soon has to re-evaluate the case once the MC-leader is found murdered in a similar wooden box. Soon, more wooden boxes are found and the police realize that they are part of a cat and mouse game with a crazy serial killer. The investigation soon shows that there is a vague connection between the victims in the shape of a 9 year old event, but what Martin Beck does not suspect is that his own life too is at stake, as the murderer has chosen him as the next victim.
File-sharing controversy.
On December 17, 2013, the previously obscure, government-subsidized B-movie gained international notoriety for its role in what is possibly the world's largest illegal file-sharing court fine.

Cephalopod eye

Cephalopods, as active marine predators, possess sensory organs specialized for use in aquatic conditions. They have a camera-type eye, which consists of a lens projecting an image onto a retina. Unlike the vertebrate camera eye, the cephalopods' form as invaginations of the body surface (rather than outgrowths of the brain), and consequently they lack a cornea. Unlike the vertebrate eye, a cephalopod eye is focused through movement, much like the lens of a camera or telescope, rather than changing shape as the lens in the human eye does. The eye is approximately spherical, as is the lens, which is fully internal.
The crystalins used in the lens appear to have developed independently from vertebrate crystalins, suggesting a homoplasious origin of the lens.
Most cephalopods possess complex extraocular muscle systems that allow for very fine control over the gross positioning of the eyes. Octopuses possess an autonomic response that maintains the orientation of their pupils such that they are always horizontal.
Polarized light.
It has been documented that several types of cephalopods, most notably squid and octopuses, and potentially cuttlefish, have eyes that can distinguish the orientation of polarized light. This sensitivity is due to the orthogonal organization of neighboring photoreceptors. To illustrate, the vertebrate eye is normally insensitive to polarization differences because visual pigment in rods and cones is arrayed semi-randomly, and is thereby equally sensitive to any orientation of the e-vector axis of the light. Because of their orthogonal organization, the visual pigment molecules in cephalopod eyes have the highest light absorption when aligned properly with the light e-vector axis, allowing sensitivity to differences in polarization. The precise function of this ability has not been proven, but is hypothesized to be for prey detection, navigation, and possibly communication among the color-changing cephalopods.

Col, Ajdovščina

Col (; archaic "Podvelb", , ) is a settlement on the edge of a karst plateau overlooking the Vipava Valley in the Municipality of Ajdovščina in the Littoral region of Slovenia. A Roman road led through the settlement. Its location overlooking the valley on the main route leading inland was used in the Middle Ages and later as a checkpoint between the Littoral region and Carniola.
Name.
The settlement was first attested in written sources as "Zoll oder Podgweld" and "Zoll oder Podgwelb" in 1763–1787. The Slovene name "Col" is borrowed from Middle High German "zol" (modern German "Zoll") 'toll' or 'customs duty'. Col is located on the border between the historical Habsburg crown lands of Carniola and Gorizia and was a collection point for tolls. Col was originally known as "Podvelb" (; literally, 'below the arch') in reference to a castle that formerly stood near Saint Leonard's Church.
Church.

Michael Homer

Michael J. Homer (February 24, 1958 – February 1, 2009) was an American electronics and computer industry executive who played major roles in the development of the personal computer, mobile devices and the Internet.
Life and career.
Homer was born in San Francisco on February 24, 1958 and was awarded a bachelor's degree at the University of California, Berkeley.
He was hired by Apple Computer in 1982, where he served as the technology adviser to the firm's chief executive, John Sculley. He followed with a position as marketing vice president at GO Corp., an early pioneer in creating software for mobile computers and personal digital assistants that did early work in pen-based computing.
After Go closed in 1994, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Go's main venture capital backer, made the connection for Homer at Marc Andreessen's Netscape Communications Corporation. Homer was a vice president at the Netscape in the 1990s at the dawn of the World Wide Web. There, Homer developed the company's initial business plan and played a pivotal role in obtaining the private financing necessary to allow the company to progress to its 1995 initial public offering. He developed marketing plans for Netscape in 1994 at a time when few people had ever heard of the Internet. During the period where Microsoft challenged Netscape's early browser dominance with its Internet Explorer product, Homer headed the firm's marketing department as it faced bitter competition from Microsoft, a challenge that ultimately resulted in an antitrust suit. Homer helped argue that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power in the operating system market to push out Netscape's browser in favor of its own.
Following AOL's acquisition of Netscape in 2000, Homer founded Kontiki, a peer-assisted content delivery technology company, that was purchased by VeriSign in March 2006 for $62 million, with a proviso that the rights to use the firm's technology would be donated to the non-profit Open Media Network. Homer fostered the early growth of a series of technology firms, including roles in the development of Google, Tellme Networks and TiVo, and sat on the board of Palm, Inc.
Illness.
In 2007, persistent memory problems he had been experiencing led to a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a very rare and incurable degenerative neurological disorder. Several people close to him created "Fight for Mike", an organization that raised $7 million used to fund research in the neurology department of the University of California, San Francisco towards study and potential cure of the disease. The team at UCSF includes Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his discovery of the prion, misshapen proteins that trigger CJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease"). The team at UCSF was studying the use of Quinacrine, long used as an antimalarial drug, in the treatment of CJD.
Homer died at age 50 on February 1, 2009 in Atherton, California. He was survived by his wife, three children, his mother and sister. The science center at Sacred Heart Preparatory (Atherton, California) is named after him.

Hans Hanke

Hans Hanke (Johannes Reinhold Hanke) (13 March 1912 — 13 August 1981) was an "SS-Obersturmbannführer" (lieutenant colonel) in the Waffen SS during World War II. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded by Nazi Germany to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Early life.
Hans Hanke was born on the 13 March 1912 in Gleiwitz, Silesia, and had at one time been a theology student. He joined the Allgemeine SS in 1933 and the Waffen SS in 1935.
World War II.
Hanke served during the Polish Campaign and then in the subsequent campaigns in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Balkans, the USSR, Croatia, and South West Hungary. He was awarded his first combat decoration during the Battle of France in June 1940.
Service with SS "Handschar".
Training.
Hanke joined the staff of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) as a SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) in May 1943 and commanded the all-German divisional signals battalion during its formation and training. He was generally well-liked by his soldiers who considered him approachable but demanding in terms of combat readiness and unit discipline. The battalion conducted its initial training at a SS training facility in Goslar, Germany.
In July 1943, the division concentrated in southern France for further training, and the signals battalion was garrisoned in Mende with divisional headquarters. In September 1943, while the division was still training in southern France, a mutiny occurred in the divisional pioneer battalion garrisoned at Villefranche-de-Rouergue. Immediately following the mutiny, the divisional commander declared martial law in the city and Hanke was appointed city commandant. In November 1943 he was promoted to "SS-Sturmbannführer".
Battalion and Regimental command in Bosnia.
In March 1944, just as the division was returning to north-east Bosnia, Hanke was appointed as the commander of the 2nd battalion of the 28th Regiment of the division (II/28). During Operation "Save" in mid-March 1944 he led II/28 as it stormed Partisan positions at Čelić, and in October 1944 his actions during this assault were included in a recommendation for an award of the German Cross in Gold.
Three months later he was appointed to command the 28th Regiment and in late June, in response to a Partisan incursion into the division's 'security zone', he forced marched his old battalion, II/28 from Vlasenica to Šekovići where they drove off a Partisan attack then counterattacked and pushed the Partisans south. His leadership in this action was also included in the recommendation for an award of the German Cross in Gold.
In August 1944, Hanke commanded elements of the 28th Regiment that scattered the Partisan 11th Border Division west of Vlasenica and then engaged in an 18 hour battle with Partisan forces holding Debelo Brdo near Šekovići which killed 121 Partisans for the loss of 18 men. These actions were also included in his recommendation for the German Cross in Gold.
Kampfgruppe Hanke.
In October 1944, due to widespread desertions, about 70% of the Bosnian Muslims of the division were disarmed and transferred elsewhere. The desertions were partly due to the constant fighting the division had been doing since March 1944, and also due to the move of much of the division from the 'security zone' in north-east Bosnia to Zagreb. Due to advances by the Soviet Red Army and its creation of two bridgeheads over the Danube, elements of the seriously under-strength division were sent to Batina to assist in throwing the Soviets back across the Danube.
A task force, known as "Kampfgruppe Hanke", was formed under Hanke's command. The task force consisted of three infantry battalions, one battalion of the divisional artillery regiment and elements of the divisional pioneer battalion. The task force arrived in Beli Manastir by rail on 14 November 1944, and were deployed in the blockade position near Zmajevać. Hanke set up his headquarters in Kneževi Vinogradi. The divisional reconnaissance battalion, which had been thrown into the fighting a month earlier, joined the task force, but even with these reinforcements the length of the front line was too long for more than a series of company-strength strong points. Until 20 November, when the Soviets placed pontoon bridges across the Danube and sent three divisions across at Batina, the task force was engaged in a continuous and bitter defensive fighting which caused heavy losses.
On the night of 21 November, the fresh Soviet 113th Rifle Division crossed the Danube and in the next 48 hours rolled straight over the top of "Kampfgruppe Hanke" which was driven back to Kneževi Vinogradi with only 200 of the original 1200 men remaining. The task force was placed under the command of the Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister and withdrew from the blocking position on 26 November and took up positions in Siklós, Hungary. The task force was soon withdrawn from the line and sent to Barcs to be re-united with the rest of the division.
Retreat to Austria and surrender.
Hanke remained as commander of the 28th Regiment until the end of the war, being promoted to "SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer" in January 1945. The division withdrew in stages to the Reich border, with Hanke's regiment fighting its last battle at Kiesmanndorff on 19 April, and their sector of the Reich Defence Line remained quiet until the capitulation on 6 May. The division then spent the period 8–12 May marching west towards Anglo-American forces in the hope of surrendering to them rather than the Soviets. Most of the division surrendered to the British.
Hanke survived the war, and was a prisoner of war with the US Armed Forces in Nurnberg-Langwasser.
Awards.
Hanke was awarded the Iron Cross (Second Class) in June 1940 and the Iron Cross (First Class) in July 1941. He was also awarded the Croatian Iron Trefoil (Second Class). He was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 28 February 1945 as a "SS-Sturmbannführer" in the 28th Regiment of the 13th SS Division. Just prior to the end of World War II in Europe he may also have been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
Postwar life.
From 1955 Hanke was employed by the Kurt Jacques Company, Rheinhausen, of which he eventually became manager/director. In the late 1960s, he worked as a project engineer at the construction of Ashuganj Power Station in Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). He died in Goslar on 13 August 1981.

Ocoee Whitewater Center

The Ocoee Whitewater Center, near Ducktown, Tennessee, United States, was the canoe slalom venue for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The Olympic race course was built in the dry riverbed of the Upper Ocoee River. The Upper Ocoee is the section between Ocoee Dam #3 and its downstream powerhouse. The Middle Ocoee is the section between Ocoee Dam #2 and its downstream powerhouse. The same river in Georgia, upstream of the lake behind Dam #3, is called the Toccoa River. The river was narrowed by two-thirds, and natural boulders were moved and cemented into place to create the drops and eddies needed for a slalom course. It is the only in-river course to be used for Olympic slalom competition. A visitor center, parking lot, and suspension foot bridge were part of the Olympic construction project.
Today, the course is watered only on summer weekends, for use by guided rafts and private boaters. The hanging slalom gates have been permanently removed. Because the river rarely has water, the Center, now operated by the U.S. Forest Service, serves primarily as a site for hiking, mountain biking, conferences, weddings, and receptions. It receives about 300,000 visitors a year.
Olympic slalom course.
River flow through the Ocoee Whitewater Center is controlled by Ocoee Dam #3, two miles (3 km) upstream. Its hydroelectric power plant is located downstream from the Center, fed by a tunnel and penstock which carry all the water used for power generation, bypassing the section of river where the Whitewater Center is located. Consequently, all water for the Olympic course must be released directly into the river from Dam #3, bypassing the tunnel and penstock and forfeiting the production of 30 megawatts of electricity. This makes the Ocoee Olympic course the world's most expensive to operate, and is the chief reason it is no longer used for slalom training and competition. Only the commercial rafting industry can afford the water.
For 54 years, from 1942, when the dam was built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, until 1996, when the Olympic Games came to Atlanta, the Upper Ocoee, a section of Ocoee riverbed between Dam #3 and its powerhouse, was dewatered except during flood control releases, usually during the winter and spring. For twenty years from 1976 to 1996, whitewater rafting on the Middle Ocoee just downstream, between Dam #2 and its powerhouse, had attracted attention to the area. The availability of the Upper Ocoee as a dry construction site during the summer greatly aided the creation of an Olympic slalom course in the riverbed.
A 1-to-10 scale model of the riverbed, with water, was constructed outdoors near the base of Ocoee Dam #1 to test the effect of the proposed course design. The 1.9% slope of the river (99 ft/mile, 19 meters/km) is typical of Olympic courses, but, because the narrowed river is still much wider than a typical artificial slalom channel, the required streamflow (1560 cubic feet/second, 44 m³/s) is two to three times greater than usual.
Construction of the course was a pivotal event in the history of Olympic whitewater. The first Olympic whitewater competition took place during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, using the world's first artificial slalom course, the Eiskanal in nearby Augsburg, as the venue. Because of the expense of course construction, the next four Summer Olympic Games were held without whitewater events. In 1992, for the Barcelona games, an artificial slalom course, Parc Olímpic del Segre, was constructed in the nearby Pyrenees mountains, using natural streamflow supplemented by pump-driven recirculation. 
After 1992, because of construction expense, the future of Olympic whitewater events was once again in question. Had they not been included in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, they might have been dropped forever, but Ocoee established whitewater as a permanent feature of the summer Olympics. Every host city since 1996 has built a whitewater stadium powered entirely by electric pumps (which consume electricity at the rate of about three megawatts, one-tenth the net electricity cost of the Ocoee course).
The Whitewater Center today.
Whitewater rafting on the Middle Ocoee, downstream from the Whitewater Center, first became a thriving industry in 1976, when the wooden flume between Dam #2 and its powerhouse was shut down for renovation. The power generation system for Dam #2 is similar to that for Dam #3. In both cases water is drained from the lake behind the dam and transported with little loss in elevation to a penstock and powerhouse several miles downstream. From Dam #2 the water travels through an above-ground wooden flume, rather than through a tunnel. In both cases, the riverbed between the dam and powerhouse, which drops about in elevation, is deprived of all the water used in power generation. 
From 1913, when Dam #2 and its flume were completed, until 1976, when the flume was shut down for repair, the section of river below the flume was waterless most of the time, especially in summer. In 1976, the sudden appearance of water in the long-dry Middle Ocoee river attracted private canoers and kayakers and commercial rafting operators, who by 1983, when the flume was put back in service, had enough political clout and money to strike a deal with TVA for regular recreational releases during the summer months. Thirteen years later, when the 1996 Olympic Games came to the Upper Ocoee, recreational releases were scheduled for the upper section of the river as well.
According to a 13-year agreement now in force, the Upper Ocoee, below Dam #3 and flowing past the Whitewater Center, has mid-day water 34 days a year, on summer weekends. The Middle Ocoee, below Dam #2, has water 106 days a year and contains 26 Adventure Class rapids. On the days when the Upper Ocoee is also watered, the Middle Ocoee has water into the early evening (its own release plus the extra water from upstream). Most rafting activity takes place on the Middle Ocoee, which has a 1% slope of 50 ft/mile (9.5 m/km). Rafting down the Upper Ocoee, and through the steeper Olympic course, is offered as a more challenging alternative.
Hiking, biking, and camping.
The Tanasi Trail System Mountain Bike Trail offers 30 miles (48 km) of trails centered on the Whitewater Center. The Thunder Rock Campground is located at Powerhouse #3, one mile (1.6 km) west (downstream) of the Center. The Ocoee Scenic Byway (U.S. 64) provides access to the center and is usually open year-round. The westbound lanes of the road were originally constructed as the parking and staging area for the Olympics, later allowing it to become a divided highway at this point to handle summertime traffic.

Economy of the Han dynasty

The Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) of ancient China experienced contrasting periods of economic prosperity and decline. It is normally divided into three periods: Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD), the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD), and Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The Xin regime, established by the former regent Wang Mang, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from Chang'an to Luoyang. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.
The Han economy was defined by significant population growth, increasing urbanization, unprecedented growth of industry and trade, and government experimentation with nationalization. In this era, the levels of minting and circulation of coin currency grew significantly, forming the foundation of a stable monetary system. The Silk Road facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with foreign countries across Eurasia, many of which were previously unknown to the people of ancient China. The imperial capitals of both Western Han (Chang'an) and Eastern Han (Luoyang) were among the largest cities in the world at the time, in both population and area. Here, government workshops manufactured furnishings for the palaces of the emperor and produced goods for the common people. The government oversaw the construction of roads and bridges, which facilitated official government business and encouraged commercial growth. Under Han rule, industrialists, wholesalers, and merchants—from minor shopkeepers to wealthy businessmen—could engage in a wide range of enterprises and trade in the domestic, public, and even military spheres.
In the early Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but they began to rely more heavily upon commercial exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying tenants of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential nobles, landowners, and merchants. The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BC severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The wealthy landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants—upon whom the government relied for tax revenues—military manpower, and public works labor. By the 180s AD, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.
Monetary system and urbanization.
Urbanization and population.
During the Warring States period (403–221 BC), the development of private commerce, new trade routes, handicraft industries, and a money economy led to the growth of new urban centers. These centers were markedly different from the older cities, which had merely served as power bases for the nobility. The use of a standardized, nationwide currency during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) facilitated long-distance trade between cities. Many Han cities grew large: the Western Han capital, Chang'an, had approximately 250,000 inhabitants, while the Eastern Han capital, Luoyang, had approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The population of the Han Empire, recorded in the tax census of 2 AD, was 57.6 million people in 12,366,470 households. The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the city walls and gatehouses. The total urban area of Western-Han Chang'an—including the extensions outside the walls—was . The total urban area of Eastern-Han Luoyang—including the extensions outside the walls—was . Both Chang'an and Luoyang had two prominent marketplaces; each market had a two-story government office demarcated by a flag and drum at the top. Market officials were charged with maintaining order, collecting commercial taxes, setting standard commodity prices on a monthly basis, and authorizing contracts between merchants and customers.
Variations in currency.
During the early Western Han period, founding Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC) closed government mints in favor of coin currency produced by the private sector. Gaozu's widow Empress Lü Zhi, as grand empress dowager, abolished private minting in 186 BC. She first issued a government-minted bronze coin weighing , but issued another, weighing , in 182 BC. The change to the lighter coin caused widespread inflation, so in 175 BC Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) lifted the ban on private minting; private mints were required to mint coins weighing exactly . Private minting was again abolished in 144 BC during the end of Emperor Jing of Han's (r. 157–141 BC) reign. Despite this, the bronze coin was issued by both central and local commandery governments until 120 BC, when for one year it was replaced with a coin weighing . Other currencies were introduced around this time. Token money notes made of embroidered white deerskin, with a face value of 400,000 coins, were used to collect government revenues. Emperor Wu also introduced three tin-silver alloy coins worth 3,000, 500, and 300 bronze coins, respectively; all of these weighed less than .
In 119 BC, the government issued the bronze "wushu" (五銖) coin weighing ; the coin remained the standard currency in China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). During the brief interruptive Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of Wang Mang (45 BC – 23 AD), the government introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (including bronze knife money, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased the value of coin currency. Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the "wushu" coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) in 40 AD at the instigation of Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the exclusive right to mint coins. Although the issue of central government coinage was transferred to the office of the Minister of Finance (one of Nine Ministers of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.
Gary Lee Todd (Ph.D. in History from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Professor of History at Sias International University in Xinzheng, Henan, China) provides the following images of coins issued during the Western Han and Xin periods on his website:
Circulation and salaries.
Merchants and peasant farmers paid property and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with a portion of their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.
From 118 BC to 5 AD, the government minted over 28,000,000,000 coins, with an annual average of 220,000,000 coins minted (or 220,000 strings of 1,000 coins). In comparison, the Tianbao period (天寶) (742–755 AD) of the Tang dynasty produced 327,000,000 coins every year while 3,000,000,000 coins in 1045 AD and 5,860,000,000 coins in 1080 AD were made in the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD). Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han, as many wages were paid solely in cash. Diwu Lun (第五倫) (fl. 40–85 AD), Governor of Shu Province (modern Sichuan), described his subordinate officials' wealth not in terms of landholdings, but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10,000,000 coin cash. Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace.
Angus Maddison estimates that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change until the beginning of the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.
Taxation, property, and social class.
Landowners and peasants.
After Shang Yang (d. 338 BC) of the State of Qin abolished the communal and aristocratic well-field system in an effort to curb the power of nobles, land in China could be bought and sold. Historical scholars of the Han dynasty like Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC) attributed the rise of the wealthy landowning class to this reform. The "Han Feizi" describes these landowners' use of hired labor in agriculture, a practice dating back to the 3rd century BC, possibly earlier. Some landowners owned small numbers of slaves, but many relied on peasant tenant farmers who paid rent with a portion of their agricultural produce. More numerous than tenants, small landowner-cultivators lived and worked independently, but often fell into debt and sold their land to the wealthy. The court official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BC) argued that if the average independent landowning family of five could cultivate no more than of land and produce no more than of grain annually, then natural disasters and high taxation rates would force many into debt, to sell their land, homes, and even children, and to become dependent upon work as tenant farmers for the wealthy.
Officials at the court of Emperor Ai of Han (r. 7–1 BC) attempted to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally, but were unsuccessful. When Wang Mang took control of the government in 9 AD, he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King's Fields (王田). This was a variation of the well-field system, where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate. Within three years, complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform. After Gengshi (r. 23–25 AD) and Guangwu (r. 25–57 AD) restored the Han dynasty, they relied on the service of great landholding families to secure their position in society. Many of their government officials also became wealthy landowners.
By the late Eastern Han period, the peasantry had become largely landless and served wealthy landowners. This cost the government significant tax revenue. Although the central government under Emperor He of Han (r. 88–105 AD) reduced taxes in times of natural disaster and distress without much effect upon the treasury, successive rulers became less able to cope with major crises. The government soon relied upon local administrations to conduct relief efforts. After the central government failed to provide local governments with provisions during both a locust swarm and the flooding of the Yellow River in 153 AD, many landless peasants became retainers of large landowners in exchange for aid. Patricia Ebrey writes that the Eastern Han was the "transitional period" between the Western Han—when small independent farmers were the vast majority—and the Three Kingdoms (220–265 AD) and later Sixteen Kingdoms (304–439 AD), when large family estates used unfree labor.
The Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 AD, the slaughter of the eunuchs in 189 AD, and the campaign against Dong Zhuo in 190 AD destabilized the central government, and Luoyang was burnt to the ground. At this point, "... private and local power came to replace public authority."
The Han Chancellor and King of Wei Cao Cao (155–220 AD) made the final significant attempt to limit the power of wealthy landowners. Cao Cao established government-managed agricultural colonies for landless commoners; in exchange for land and cheap equipment, the farmers paid a portion of their crop yield. In the 120s BC, Emperor Wu had attempted to establish agricultural colonies in the northwestern frontier of the newly conquered Hexi Corridor (in modern Gansu). 600,000 new settlers farmed on these state lands using seeds, draft animals and equipment loaned by the government. An imperial edict in 85 AD ordered the local governments of commanderies and subordinate kingdoms to resettle landless peasants onto state-owned lands, where they would be paid wages, provided with crop seeds, loaned farming tools and exempted from rent payments for five years and poll taxes for three years. The edict also allowed peasants to return to their native counties at any time. Subsequent governments of the Three Kingdoms established agricultural colonies on these models.
Tax reforms.
Because small landowning families represented the mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants to return to their land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.
Towards the end of the Han dynasty, the land tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by increasing the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.
Though requiring additional revenue to fund the Han–Xiongnu War, the government during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners. To increase revenue, the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants, confiscated land from nobles, sold offices and titles, and established government monopolies over the minting of coins, iron manufacture and salt mining. New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats, carts, carriages, wheelbarrows, shops and other properties. The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BC from 120 coins for every 10,000 coins-worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2,000 coins-worth of property owned. Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown, except for that of liquor. After the government monopoly on liquor was abolished in 81 BC, a property tax of 2 coins for every was levied on liquor merchants.
The sale of certain offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by Empress Dowager Deng Sui—who reigned as regent from 105–121 AD—to raise government revenues in times of severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the Qiang people in western China. The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the eunuch-dominated government of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 AD), when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of being filled by vetted candidates who had taken Imperial examinations or attended the Imperial University.
Conscription.
Two forms of mass conscription existed during the Han period. These were civilian conscription ("gengzu" 更卒) and military conscription ("zhengzu" 正卒). In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes, all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty-six were required to undertake mandatory conscription duties for one month of each year. These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.
At the age of twenty-three years male peasants were drafted to serve in the military, where they were assigned to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army ("Nanjun" 南軍), while the Northern Army ("Beijun" 北軍) was a standing army composed of paid career soldiers.
During the Eastern Han, peasants could avoid the month of annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in commutation ("gengfu" 更賦). This development went hand in hand with the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.
Merchants.
There were two categories of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who had to resort to peddling were to be exempted from taxation.
Itinerant merchants were often wealthy and did not have to register. These itinerant merchants often participated in large-scale trade with powerful families and officials. Nishijima writes that most of the biographies of "wealthy men" in the "Records of the Grand Historian" and "Book of Han" were those of itinerant merchants.
In contrast, registered marketplace merchants had a very low social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants were not allowed to own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.
Crafts, industries, and government employment.
Private manufacture and government monopolies.
Iron and salt.
At the beginning of the Han dynasty, China's salt and iron enterprises were privately owned by a number of wealthy merchants and subordinate regional kings. The profits of these industries rivaled the funds of the imperial court. A successful iron or salt industrialist might have employed over a thousand peasants, causing a severe loss of agricultural tax revenue to the central government. To restrict the power of the industrialists, Emperor Wu had nationalized the salt and iron industries by 117 BC.
The government also instituted a liquor monopoly in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC in an effort to reduce government intervention in the private economy.
The Reformist Party supported privatization, opposing the Modernist Party, which had dominated politics during the reign of Emperor Wu and the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.
Wang Mang preserved these central government monopolies. When Eastern Han began, they were once again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs. Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 AD) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 AD, but abolished them in the last year of his reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership. The Han first learned how to get salt from the ocean but eventually figured out a way to drill salt from the ground
Grain.
The grain trade was a profitable private enterprise during the early Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the "equable marketing system" (also known as the "ever-normal granary system") in 110 BC. The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue. The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57–75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD, when he believed that the government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.
Ebrey argues that although most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost an important source of revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.
Government workshops.
Han government workshops produced common, luxury, and even artistic funerary items, such as the ceramic figurines and tomb tiles which adorned the walls of underground tombs. Imperial workshops were operated by the Minister Steward, whose ministry controlled the treasury and the emperor's private finances.
The "Office of Arts and Crafts", subordinate to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, bronze mirrors, vessel wares, and other goods. "The Office of Manufactures", also subordinate to the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and armor. Textiles and clothing worn by the emperor and royal family were made in the "Weaving House of the West" and "Weaving House of the East"; the latter was abolished in 28 BC, and the "Weaving House of the West" was renamed the "Weaving House".
Workshops located in the commanderies made silks and embroidered fabrics, silver and gold luxury items, and weapons. One workshop, in modern Anhui province, had a shipyard where battle ships were built. Although the government used the labor of state-owned slaves, corvée laborers, and convicts in its workshops, they also hired skilled craftsmen who were well-paid.
Han lacquerwares were privately made as well as being manufactured in government workshops. Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item, such as a lacquered cup or screen. Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the clan name of the family who owned them. Others were inscribed with the titles of the owner, the specific type of the vessels, their capacities, the precise day, month, and year of manufacture (according to Chinese era names and their lunisolar calendar), the names of the floor managers who oversaw the items' production and the names of the workers who made them. Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made and the name of the workshop. Bronze calipers from the Xin dynasty, used for minute measurements, had an inscription stating that it was "made on a "gui-you" day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the Shijian guo period." The calipers date from 9 AD. Han lacquerwares bearing the imperial mark of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists, in places such as Qingzhen (in Guizhou), Pyongyang (in North Korea), and Noin Ula (in Mongolia).
Public construction projects.
The Court Architect was charged by central government with overseeing all imperial construction and public works projects, including the building of palaces and tombs.
During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were organized into work teams consisting of over a hundred thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over a total of five years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the spirits of the emperor's ancestors. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation. Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), respectively.
Nineteen stone inscriptions survive commemorating the building of new roads and bridges by the Eastern Han government. Archaeological excavations at Chang'an show that wooden bridges were built over the defensive moat and led to the gatehouses. Roadways also needed periodic repairs; in 63 AD the route leading from the Qilian Mountains, through Hanzhong (modern southern Shanxi), and towards the capital Luoyang underwent major repairs. For this project, 623 trestle bridges, five large bridges, 107 km (66 mi) of new roadways, and 64 buildings—including rest houses, post stations, and relay stations—were built. Those commissioned with military authority also built bridges. For example, during his campaign against the Xiongnu in the Ordos Desert in 127 BC, the general Wei Qing (d. 106 BC) had a new bridge built over the Wujia River (a former tributary of the Yellow River) in today's Inner Mongolia. He used this bridge to move troops and supplies for an attack on the Xiongnu, northwest of modern Wuyuan County (五原县). Ebrey writes:
There were, of course, numerous reasons for maintaining roads. A unified political system could be maintained only as long as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.
Domestic trade.
Traded goods and commodities.
Han-era historians like Sima Qian (145–86 BC) and Ban Gu (32–92 AD), as well as the later historian Fan Ye (398–445 AD), recorded details of the business transactions and products traded by Han merchants. Evidence of these products has also emerged from archaeological investigations.
The main agricultural staple foods during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including "prunus salicina" and "Prunus mume"), peach, apricot, and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, owl, Chinese Bamboo Partridge, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and various types of fish were commonly consumed meats.
The production of silk through sericulture was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing was too expensive for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.
Common bronze items included domestic wares like oil lamps, incense burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron goods were often used for construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, adze, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, scratch awls, and nails. Iron was also used to make swords, halberds, arrowheads and scale armor for the military.
Other common goods included: consumables (liquor, pickles and sauces, sheep and pigs, grain, yeast for fermentation, bean relish, dried fish and abalone, dates, chestnuts, fruits and vegetables), raw materials (cattle hide, boat timber, bamboo poles, dyes, horns, cinnabar, raw lacquer, jade, amber), clothing and clothing materials (silk fabrics, fine and coarse cloth, sable and foxskin garments, felt and mats, deerskin slippers), eating utensils (bronze utensils and chopsticks, silver, wood and iron vessels, ceramic wares), art objects (lacquerware, ceramics), elegant coffins (made of catalpa, locust, juniper, and lacquered wood), vehicles such as light two-wheeled carts and heavy oxcarts, and horses.
In addition to general commodities, Han historians list the goods of specific regions. Common trade items from the region of modern Shanxi included bamboo, timber, grain, and gemstones; Shandong had fish, salt, liquor, and silk; Jiangnan had camphor, catalpa, ginger, cinnamon, gold, tin, lead, cinnabar, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shell, pearls, ivory, and leather. Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd-century AD tomb in Wuwei, Gansu (along the Hexi Corridor fortified by the Great Wall of China), evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers.
... fourteen pieces of pottery; wooden objects such as a horse, pig, ox, chicken, chicken coop, and a single-horned animal; seventy copper cash; a crossbow mechanism made of bronze; a writing brush; a lacquer-encased inkstone; a lacquer tray and bowl; a wooden comb; a jade ornament; a pair of hemp shoes; a straw bag; the remains of an inscribed banner; a bamboo hairpin; two straw satchels; and a stone lamp.
Estate management and trade.
In the early Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which prohibited those involved in agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade. These laws were largely ineffective, since wealthy landowners and landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates. Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 AD), a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government's secretariat, started a winery business in his home to pay for his father's funeral. His fellow gentry criticized him, claiming the practice was immoral, but not illegal.
Cui Shi's book "Simin yueling" (四民月令) is the only significant surviving work on agriculture from the Eastern Han period, though about 3,000 written characters of the "Fan Shengzhi shu" (氾勝之書), dated to the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (33–7 BC), still survive. Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship, festival and religious holiday celebrations, conduct for family and kinship relations, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times to buy and sell certain types of farm-produced goods.
The following table is modelled on Ebrey's "Estate and Family Management in the Later Han as Seen in the Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People" (1974). Ebrey writes: "... the same item was often bought and sold at different times of the year. The rationale for this is very clearly financial: items were bought when the price was low and sold when it was high." The specific amounts for each commodity traded are not listed, yet the timing of sale and purchase during the year is the most valuable information for historians. Missing from Cui Shi's list are important items which his family certainly bought and sold at specific times of the year, such as salt, iron farm tools and kitchen utensils, paper and ink (the papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun in 105 AD), as well as luxury items of silk and exotic foods.
There was mass unemployment among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary evidence shows that those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.
Bricks lining the walls of the tombs of wealthy Han were adorned with carved or molded reliefs and painted murals; these often showed scenes of the tomb occupant's estate, halls, wells, carriage sheds, pens for cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs, stables for horses, and employed workers picking mulberry leaves, plowing crop fields, and hoeing vegetable patches.
Small and medium-sized estates were managed by single families. The father acted as the head manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house in exchange for a third or a half of their crop yield.
Foreign trade and tributary exchange.
Prior to the Han dynasty, markets close to China's northern border engaged in trade with the nomadic tribes of the eastern Eurasian Steppe. The heqin agreement between the Han and nomadic Xiongnu stipulated the transfer of tributary goods from China. The exact amount of annual tribute sent to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BC is unknown. In 89 BC, when Hulugu Chanyu (狐鹿姑) (r. 95–85 BC) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement, he demanded an annual tribute of or 10,000 "dan" of wine, or 5,000 "hu" of grain, and 10,000 bales of silk. These amounts of wine, grain, and silk were considered to be a significant increase from earlier amounts of tribute, which must have been much less. Besides these arrangements, the most common commercial exchanges between the Xiongnu and Han merchants consisted of the trading of Xiongnu horses and furs for Han agricultural foodstuffs and luxury items, most notably silk. By means of the black market, the Xiongnu were also able to smuggle Han iron weapons across the border.
The Han established a diplomatic presence in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states. The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored as a means to pay for food and lodging. Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and established a Protectorate there, Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court. The Arsacid court sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now Burma sent elephants and rhinoceroses. Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.
The Han court received tributary submission from the Xiongnu leader Huhanye (呼韓邪) (r. 58–31 BC), an important rival to Zhizhi Chanyu (r. 56–36 BC, died at the Battle of Zhizhi). Huhanye's tribute, exchange of hostages, and presence at Chang'an in the New Year of 51 BC were rewarded with the following gifts from the emperor: of gold, 200,000 coins, 77 suits of clothes, 8,000 bales of silk fabric, of silk floss, 15 horses, and of grain. However, this is the only occurrence of rewarded gifts that present materials other than fabric. As shown in the table below, based upon Yü Ying-shih's "Han Foreign Relations" (1986), the gifts consisted only silk after 51 BC, and the Xiongnu leader's political submission was guaranteed only for as long as the Han could provide him with ever greater amounts of imperial largesse of silk with each succeeding visit to the Chinese court.
The establishment of the Silk Road occurred during Wu's reign, owing to the efforts of the diplomat Zhang Qian. The increased demand for silk from the Roman Empire stimulated commercial traffic in both Central Asia and across the Indian Ocean. Roman merchants sailed to Barbarikon near present-day Karachi, Pakistan, and Barygaza in present-day Gujarat, India to purchase Chinese silks (see Roman trade with India). When Emperor Wu conquered Nanyue—in what is now Southwest China and northern Vietnam—in 111 BC, overseas trade was extended to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as maritime merchants traded Han gold and silk for pearls, jade, lapis lazuli, and glasswares.
The Book of Later Han states that Roman envoys sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180 AD), following a southern route, brought gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD) in 166 AD. This Roman mission followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Han diplomat Gan Ying to reach Rome in 97. Gan Ying was delayed at the Persian Gulf, by Arsacid authorities, and could only make a report on Rome based on oral accounts. Historians Charles Hucker and Rafe de Crespigny both speculate that the Roman mission of 166 AD involved enterprising Roman merchants instead of actual diplomats; Hucker writes:
Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 A.D. claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
The main trade route leading into Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west was the central node of international trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. "vitis vinifera") were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia have been found in Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn Period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.
