2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final

The 2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final was the ultimate football match of the 2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship, contested by Laois and Westmeath over two games in Croke Park, Dublin. The first game finished level so a replay occurred. Westmeath won their first ever title at senior level, leaving Wicklow and Fermanagh as the only other counties yet to achieve this. The season also saw the emergence of Denis Glennon.
Pre-match.
Westmeath had only ever before appeared in two Leinster Senior Football Championship finals in their history: in 1931 and 1949. They went into the 2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship bidding to win their first ever title at senior level, with the only other counties still to achieve this being Wicklow and Fermanagh.
Westmeath midfielder Rory O'Connell was banned for 12-weeks for stamping on Offaly's Pascal Kellaghan during Westmeath's Leinster Senior Football Championship win on 23 May 2004. This threatened O'Connell's participation in the final. Kellaghan submitted a letter saying the offence had not happened.
Reaction.
Commentators hailed Westmeath's win as monumental, with the "Irish Independent"s Eamonn Sweeney, 'Richard Stakelum famously greeted Tipperary's first Munster title in sixteen years with the words, "The famine is over." What Westmeath have endured makes the famine of other counties look more like minor spells of peckishness. There was a song a few years back which described the failures of the English soccer team as "thirty years of hurt." Thirty years? How about one hundred and twenty years of hurt. And those years never stopped Westmeath dreaming either.' Colm O'Rourke said it was "one of the greatest days ever in Croke Park and must have given rise to the biggest street party ever in Westmeath capital Mullingar last night".
Aftermath.
Westmeath player David Mitchell later joined Longford.

Blood Lake

Blood Lake is a 2006 pornographic horror film written by Erin Gilmer, and directed by C.L. Gregory.
Plot.
A group of friends (Andy, Roger, Tricia, Max, Nell, Charlotte and Nicole) head to some lakeside cabins for the weekend. Arriving at the cabins, the septet find a "blood book" that tells the story of Preacher Jacob, a priest who took over the nearby town's congregation in 1896. Jacob had his followers commit mass suicide, under the belief that he could resurrect them as a new, perfect race enlightened by their deaths. Max and Nell go off to have sex, but before they do so Max skims the blood book and reads an incantation aloud, summoning the homicidal spirit of Preacher Jacob.
The first of the group to be killed is Roger, who Preacher Jacob axes in the back. The preacher then captures Nicole, ties her to a tree, and hacks her to death with the axe. Next, Sam is garroted with a rope, and Nell has her throat slit in the shower. Tricia realizes what is going on, and tries to get help from Andy and Charlotte, but the two are kept sealed in their cabin by a supernatural force until Tricia is scared off by Preacher Jacob, who Andy and Charlotte spot, and conclude is connected to the blood book. Andy and Charlotte decide to barricade themselves in the cabin until sunrise, and pass the time by having sex.
Later, Charlotte goes to wake Andy up, but finds Preacher Jacob in his bed. The preacher kills her, and goes after the wounded Andy (who has the blood book) and Tricia. Preacher Jacob chases Andy and Tricia to a dock, strangles Andy, and is seemingly destroyed when Tricia sets the blood book on fire. Tricia gets in one of the cars and drives away, but as she leaves the campgrounds, Preacher Jacob appears in the vehicle, and attacks her.
Reception.
AVN said the film's sex scenes were passable, but that it suffered from an incoherent script, sloppy editing, painfully bad acting, and dull dialogue.
Adult DVD Talk gave "Blood Lake" an overall grade of a half star out of five, and stated the photography was terrible, the editing laughably inept, and the acting and gore non-existent. X Critic awarded the film one star out of five, and criticized every aspect of it, writing that it is "one of the worst hardcore releases in recent years" and that it felt "half completed, over edited and devoid of anything that makes terror and twat the least bit interesting".

1932 Freeport hurricane

The 1932 Freeport hurricane was an intense tropical cyclone that primarily affected areas of the Texas coast in August of the 1932 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the second storm and first hurricane of the season, developing just off the Yucatán Peninsula on August 12. While moving to the northwest, the storm began to quickly intensify the next day. It rapidly intensified from a Category 1 hurricane to a Category 4 with winds estimated at and an estimated central pressure of shortly before making landfall near Freeport, Texas, early on August 14. After landfall, the hurricane began to quickly weaken before dissipating over the Texas Panhandle.
The storm caused heavy rainfall inland, peaking at in Angleton. Record rainfall rates were also reported in some areas. Power outages were reported in Galveston and San Antonio. The storm caused $7.5 million in damages, mostly to crops, and 40 deaths.
Meteorological history.
The Freeport hurricane was first noted by ships on August 12 as a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico. However, it was suggested in later research that the disturbance may have originated from a low-pressure area between Belize and Honduras on August 11. Steadily moving to the northwest, the storm began to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 13, and soon after reaching major hurricane strength later that day. A report remarked that the storm was "phenomenal" due to the fact that previously the storm had "seemed to be of only moderate intensity" while near land before rapidly intensifying. 
The storm eventually reached winds of , making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane proceeded to make landfall early on August 14 just east of Freeport with winds of . A ship just offshore of the coast reported a minimum pressure of , but the official estimate for the hurricane's landfall intensity was set to given the fact that the system was still rapidly intensifying at the time. Due to the storm's small size, it quickly weakened to tropical storm strength later that day. The storm finally weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating the next day over the Texas Panhandle. 
Preparations, impact, and aftermath.
In preparation for the storm, 150 vehicles evacuated out of Freeport, while water craft were taken up the Brazos River as far inland as possible. 100 families in Caplen and Gilchrist were also evacuated. The 38th division of the Texas National Guard, stationed in Palacios, was alerted due to the oncoming storm. 
Heavy rainfall occurred across the coast and further inland due to the storm. Four locations set 24-hour rainfall records for the month of August, the highest of which was set near Angleton, recording of rain on August 13. Angleton also faced a water shortage after its pumping station was destroyed. The remnants of the storm produced as much as of rain in Oklahoma.
Occupants in four vehicles were rescued by the United States Coast Guard near San Luis Pass. In Wharton, 800 birds went missing in the heavy rain. Galveston suffered primarily wind damage in the form of unroofed structures and broken windows. The Galveston Causeway was flooded by the heavy rain, preventing access from Galveston Island to the mainland. Several other roads were blocked by fallen trees. 
The city was also affected by a power outage after the storm caused loss of power and damaged communication lines. In addition, communication lines in San Antonio were damaged.
At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11 planes were damaged when a hangar collapsed, resulting in losses of $250,000. Hermann Park was also affected by the storm, where nine goats began to roam within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb. 35 convicts were freed from the Ramsey Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27 others missing.
After the storm, the American Red Cross brought supplies to areas affected by the hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work. Several other local relief committees also brought supplies to affected areas. An estimated $2 million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton. The storm was estimated to have killed 40 people and caused $7.5 million in damage.

Friar's Balsam (horse)

Friar's Balsam (1885–1899) was an English Thoroughbred racehorse. He was the outstanding British two-year-old of 1887, when he was unbeaten in seven races. He was a sick horse when a beaten favourite in the following year's 2000 Guineas, but returned in the autumn to beat Minting in the Champion Stakes. Friar's Balsam was retired to stud where he had some success as a sire of winners. He was trained at Kingsclere by John Porter for Lord Alington and Sir Frederick Johnstone.
Breeding.
Friar's Balsam was a chestnut colt foaled in 1885. His conformation was not perfect, as he was described as being "very much over at the knee". Friar's Balsam's sire was the Epsom Derby winner Hermit. His dam, Flower of Dorset, was sired by Breadalbane out of the Park Hill Stakes winner Imperatrice, the founder of Thoroughbred family 2-k.
Racing career.
1887: two-year-old season.
Friar's Balsam began his racing career in the New Stakes at Ascot. In a field of seven that included Seabreeze and Ayrshire he won easily. After this race his owners Alington and Johnston refused an offer of £10,000 for him. He followed the New Stakes up with a win in the Hurstborne Stakes at Stockbridge. His next start came in the July Stakes, where he beat Seabreeze by ¾ length. His registered his fourth successive win in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood, carrying a ten pound weight penalty. At the same meeting he also won the Molecombe Stakes in a walkover. After a break won the Middle Park Plate beating a field that again included Seabreeze. His seventh and final start of the season came in the Dewhurst Plate, where he won carrying a ten pound penalty.
1888: three-year-old season.
Friar's Balsam had been the favourite for the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby throughout the winter and spring. A small field of six went to post for the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Tom Cannon, Friar's Balsam was the 1/3 favourite, Ayrshire was at 100/12 and Orbit was 100/8. Friar's Balsam began near the rear, but he never came to the front and was in trouble a long way from the finish. He eventually finished fifth, with Ayshire winning easily by two lengths. He had looked beaten only a quarter of a mile into the race and it was later found that an abscess in his mouth had burst in the opening stages. He was then taken out of the Derby.
His first race back after the 2000 Guineas was the Lancashire Plate, where he finished unplaced and the race was won by Seabreeze. He started the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in a field that included Minting. Minting started favourite the 60/100 favourite, with Friar's Balsam at 5/2. After the start he settled in third place of the six runners. In the closing stages Friar's Balsam and Minting drew rapidly clear of the others before they had even been asked for an effort. With Friar's Balsam in a slight lead Minting tried to close, but could not and Friar's Balsam beat him by half a length without being extended, the two being well clear of the rest.
1889: four-year-old season.
At the end of the 1888 season Friar's Balsam underwent an operation. His only run as a four-year-old was in the Royal Stakes at Kempton Park, where he finished unplaced behind Ayrshire.
Stud record.
At stud Friar's Balsam sired Balsamo who won the valuable City and Suburban Handicap. He also sired Mother Siegel who was the dam of 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby winner Minoru. Another of his daughters, Grand Marnier, was the grandam of the Derby winner Grand Parade. Friar's Balsam's son Voter became a leading racehorse in North America, winning the Metropolitan Handicap. Voter in turn sired Ballot, who was rated the best older horse in America in 1908 and 1910. Friar's Balsam died in 1899 at the age of fourteen.

Otto Lipmann

Otto Lipmann (6 March 1880 – 7 October 1933) was a German psychologist, an expert in vocational guidance, and one of the pioneers in the use of counseling for the selection of a profession.
Biography.
Otto Lipmann was born in Breslau on March 6, 1880. His parents were Emo Lipmann and Hulda Wendrina. In 1904, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Breslau. Over the years, Lipmann contributed to several fields of psychology, especially industrial psychology, with the development of the first selection tests for aviators in Germany, and also for typesetters, industrial apprentices, telegraphists and academic workers, amongst others. He also introduced the principles of vocational guidance in that country, and was the first psychologist to employ statistics in his works, which include “Psychische Geschlechts Unterschiede”, “Wirtschafts psychologie und psychologische Berufsberatung”, “Die psychologische Analyse der höheren Berufe” y “Grundriss der Arbeitswissenschaft und Ergebnisse der arbeitswissenschaftlichen Statistik”.
In 1906, along with psychologist William Stern, Lipmann founded the Institute for Applied Psychology in Berlin, and in 1908, the Journal of Applied Psychology (“Zeitschrift für angewandte Psychologie”). In 1920, along with Curt Piorkowski, he founded the Institute of Professional and Business Psychology, which was in charge of the development of psychological tests of professional skills and vocational guidance. As a consequence of the rise of the National Socialist party in Germany, on October 1, 1933, Lipmann was discharged as an editor of the Journal of Applied Psychology. That same year he was forced to turn down a job offer from the University of Berlin, an opportunity he had considered due to his declining finances.
Lipmann married Gertrude Wendrina, with whom he had two children, Hans and Emily Marta (born on July 6, 1907). On October 7, 1933, Lipmann died of an unexpected heart failure. In 1937, his daughter Emily emigrated from Germany, and so did his wife one year later. Gertrude died in Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1941. Emily married Vladimir Kaplun and they had three daughters, Katherine, Helen and Irene.
Science of Work.
Lipmann proposes a distinction between “capactiy-to-work” and “preparedness-to-work”. The former is defined as “an individuals maximal performance under ideal conditions”, while the latter is related to the “willingness-to-work”, which involves the worker’s motivation and satisfaction, and can be increased with compensation systems and fair promotions, for example.
As to vocational guidance, Lipmann says that psychological counseling –carried out through tests, questionnaires and analysis of professions– is more effective if it’s based on personality traits, which helps determine a suitable profession for each individual. He also proposes a classification for professions: lower, middle, and high. Since these classifications are based on the characteristics of the individuals, their boundaries are not fixed. For example, a worker can elevate a middle profession to a higher artistic level if he performs his tasks with creativity and imagination. At the same time, high professions can be subjective (imagination plays an important role) or objective (things are perceived without the influence of feelings or imagination).
Lipmann was very critical of the scientific management approaches of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Lillian and Frank Gilbreth. He believed that loss of efficiency was related to the lack of interest from the workers, and feared that technological advances would damage the link between the worker and his work, generating more dissatisfaction.

1960s decor

1960s décor refers to a distinct style of interior design which became prominent in the 1960s and early 1970s. Dark greens, yellows, pinks, and orange hues (such as pea green, drab, peach, and saffron) were very popular for wallpaper, carpets, curtains, sofas, chair seats and cushions, often with patterns or bright flowers. English designer David Hicks was an important influence on interior design in the 1960s inspired by bright colours associated with India. Hicks was influential in designs "with psychedelic patterns and acid-edged colors" which became extremely common in the period 1967-1973 especially. The psychedelic designs came at a time when the hippy movement and "flower power" was at its height. At the same time, Dorothy Draper, Manhattan's top interior designer in the 1960s, used 'dull' white and 'shiny' black as one of her favorite combinations.
The "Retro Modern" style is associated with the decades of the 1950s and 1960s. As a furniture material, polypropylene, whose color could be matched to paint chips, came into its own during the 1960s. Foam molding, mostly used as upholstery cushions, became a basic structural unit for furniture in the early 1960s. In the 1960s, large areas, such as sofas, beds, carpets, drapes and wallcovers, were covered in vibrant colors. Employing "psychedelic intensity", the colors and styles were influenced by India, Spain, and the Mediterranean.
Many hotels and restaurants retain their décor from the 1960s or specifically employ sixties style features to give them a more nostalgic sensibility. Pink or orange paintwork or bedspreads and curtains which were fashionable in the 1960s, however, are often considered to be "hideous" or "painful" today and unappealing to many. As Paul Evans put it, "For many the popular image of 1960s home design was of ephemerality and excess, of plastic or paper chairs and lurid carpets and wallpaper." 1960s television series such as "The Avengers", "Batman", "The Man from U.N.C.L.E", "Bewitched", "The Saint", and "Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)" provide fine examples of the type of décor popular during this period and are an important aspect of the look of the productions; for the latter orange hues are even used in the title design.

<doc id="36659758" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36659758" title="ChefVille">
ChefVille

ChefVille is a multiplayer restaurant simulation social network game created by Zynga. The game was announced at Zynga's June 2012 Unleashed event, debuted August 2012 on Facebook, and was released Oct. 3, 2012 on Zynga.com. Within the first month of its release, "ChefVille" had become the No. 1 Facebook game. As of early October 2012, "ChefVille" had more than 4.8 million daily active users (DAU) and more than 45 million monthly active users (MAU). 
History.
"ChefVille" is Zynga’s second game in the restaurant genre following "Café World", a Facebook game with 456,000 DAU and 2.4 million MAU as of early October 2012. The main differences are that "ChefVille" players interact with the environment outside their virtual restaurant and earn real recipes as they progress in the game. "ChefVille" is available for free in 17 languages on Facebook.
Gameplay.
"ChefVille" players act as chef, restaurant owner, designer and manager with the goal of creating a ‘dream restaurant.’ Players customize restaurants to specific themes, such as a 1950s diner or an Italian restaurant, and they mix and match food types while cooking and serving. Players also choose the restaurant décor, from sushi stations and cold stations to woks and grills, and cook menu items that correlate with their cooking equipment. 
Similar to other Zynga ‘ville’ games, players are given tools needed to build their restaurants. Players cook dishes using various appliances, such as a brick oven for cooking pizza. As the game progresses, players help friends by sharing needed recipe ingredients, by dining in their friends’ restaurants, and by helping friends build their restaurants. Players can also purchase food and ingredients with actual currency. 
With "ChefVille"’s ‘Game to Table’ feature, players who master a dish can receive a recipe for that dish by email. At the time of launch, the game included more than 200 in-game recipes, 50 of which players could earn. Game recipes include Confit de Canard with Potatoes au Gratin, Miso Soup, Bruschetta and Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise. "ChefVille" recipes are created by Zynga Executive Chef Matthew Du Trumble and his team of 15 company chefs. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and his wife contributed a Spaghetti Bolognese recipe to the game. Players also have the ability to show off their own recipes in the game. 
"ChefVille" takes place on a map segmented into a grid, with new areas unlocked as players meet milestones or spend actual currency. Recipe ingredients are obtained from raw materials acquired from visiting spots on the map, such as a butcher for fresh beef, a milk truck for fresh milk, and a breadbox for bread. 
Currency.
"ChefVille" players earn rewards and receive help from friends for free. They can also use actual currency to buy recipe ingredients or borrow food from friends by dining in their restaurants. 
Partnerships.
On September 19, 2012, Zynga and Food Network announced a promotion in which celebrity chef Robert Irvine appeared as a virtual avatar within the game. For two weeks, virtual Robert Irvine guided ChefVille players through a series of quests and helped players enhance their in-game restaurants.

Tarbelli

The Tarbelli were an Aquitani pre-Roman tribe settled in what today is southwestern France, in the region between the river Adour and the Pyrenees. The capital of the Tarbelli people was "Aquae Tarbellicae", present-day Dax. They were the ancient inhabitants of Labourd, in the Northern Basque Country, in the present-day French department of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques.
Their historical territory today corresponds very well with the extension of the Lapurdian dialect of the Basque language. The Tarbelli, like all other Aquitanians, spoke an archaic form of the Basque language, known as Aquitanian language, whose dialects are unknown.
History.
The Tarbelli are mentioned by Roman authors; Julius Caesar names them "Tarbelli quatuorsignani", "Tarbelli of the four banners", which means the Tarbelli were actually a confederacy of four different tribes. They lived in small territory in what today is the southwest of France, between the river Adour and the Pyrenees, this region being the traditional province of Labourd, of the Northern Basque Country.
Their capital city was "Aquae Tarbellicae", present-day Dax, with Orthez being also an important Tarbelli city. They are presumably related to other Aquitani tribes, as the Vascones, among others. During the Roman times, the Tarbelli territory was part of a greater region called "Novempopulania".

It's better than it was but it's back". MacDonald compared the styling of the songs to previous albums saying, "For those of you who prefer "Albatross", there are 3 songs you will gravitate to. For those of you who like "The Silver Cord", there are probably 5 songs you will gravitate to. For those of you who like when we stretch the boundaries a bit, there are another 4 tracks you'll probably be ecstatic about.".

Mr. Farmer

"Mr. Farmer" is a song by American rock group The Seeds, written by vocalist Sky Saxon and produced by Marcus Tybalt. It was released as a single in 1967 and peaked at number 86 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The song was banned on many radio stations during the time of its release because of its drug references.
Lyrical content and recording.
Written by Sky Saxon, "Mr. Farmer" depicts the tale of a man who becomes dissatisfied with city life and moves to the country, buys five acres, and spends time watering crops. 
Though Saxon attempted to disguise the lyrics to make the song's message appear anti-drug, the song was widely interpreted as a tribute a marijuana growers and was banned on many radio stations. 
Keyboardist Daryl Hooper later recalled discussing the song's bassline with Harvey Sharp, who had often played bass with the band in studio. Because the Seeds did not employ a bassist during live performances, Hooper used the left-hand bass on a Wurlitzer during small club performances, and later used a Fender Rhodes bass for larger shows.
Reception.
"Mr. Farmer" was released as a single in February 1967 and peaked at number 86 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. 
Music historian Domenic Priore compared the song's piano sound to that of early Pink Floyd records. 
Author Harvey Kubernik called the song a "punk-pop classic", and writer Malcolm Russell described it as a "tight groover".
Other appearances and versions.
"Mr. Farmer" appeared on the 1987 compilation "More Nuggets: Classics From The Psychedelic Sixties Volume 2" and was featured on the 2000 soundtrack to the film "Almost Famous". 
Sky Saxon revisited the song on his 2008 solo album "The King of Garage Rock". 
Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock recorded a cover version of the song on their 2012 album "Wake Up Where You Are".

The United States federal government defines and delineates the nation's metropolitan areas for statistical purposes, using a set of standard statistical area definitions. As of 2013, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined and delineated 388 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and 541 micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs) in the United States and Puerto Rico. Many of these 929 MSAs and μSAs are, in turn, components of larger combined statistical areas (CSAs) consisting of adjacent MSAs and μSAs that are linked by commuting ties; as of 2013, 524 metropolitan and micropolitan areas are components of the 169 defined CSAs. 
Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are defined as consisting of one or more adjacent counties or county equivalents with at least one urban core area meeting relevant population thresholds, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core, as measured by commuting ties. A metropolitan statistical area has at least one urban core with a population of at least 50,000.

FS Class ETR 240

The ETR 240 (; meaning Fast Electric Train, series 240) is an Italian electric multiple unit (EMU) introduced in the 1980s.
Development.
In the 1930s, the Italian state railways, Ferrovie dello Stato, electrified the main line Milan-Bologna-Florence-Rome-Naples and needed a fast train to use on it and on other newly electrified ones. The first ETR 200 was built by Società Italiana Ernesto Breda, (now AnsaldoBreda), in 1936, with three cars on four bogies, two of which had a single T 62-R-100 motor while the others were provided with two similar motors each. The ETR 200 entered in service in 1937. In the early 1960s the remaining sixteen ETR 200 units were converted to ETR 220 by adding a fourth car and other changes. The ETR 240 entered in service in the late 1980s and remained in service until the late 1990s and were used for charter trains up and in the Civitavecchia-Rome line.

Supporting electrolyte

A supporting electrolyte, in electrochemistry, according to an IUPAC definition, is an electrolyte containing chemical species that are not electroactive (within the range of potentials used) and which has an ionic strength and conductivity much larger than those due to the electroactive species added to the electrolyte. Supporting electrolyte is also sometimes referred to as "inert electrolyte" or "inactive electrolyte".
Supporting electrolytes are widely used in electrochemical measurements when control of electrode potentials is required. This is done to increase the conductivity of the solution (to practically eliminate the so-called IR drop), to eliminate the transport of electroactive species by ion migration in the electric field, to maintain constant ionic strength, to maintain constant pH, etc.

Kampala wedding massacre

The Kampala wedding massacre occurred at a wedding party in Naguru, Kampala, Uganda on June 26, 1994. When wedding guest Irene Ati declined a request by ASV soldier Richard Komakech to dance with him, he began rioting and was expelled from the festivities. The drunken private went to fetch a semi-automatic rifle and returned about ten minutes later. He first killed Irene Ati and then started shooting randomly at the guests. 14 people died on the spot and 12 more later died in hospital, while 13 others were seriously wounded. Komakech eventually turned the gun on himself and attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, though he suffered only wounds to his forehead and pretended to be dead until police arrived. Although officers tried to prevent the guests from lynching him, Irene Ati's father managed to break through the police cordon and killed Komakech by smashing in his skull.

Florence Bridge

The Florence Bridge is a bridge that carries Illinois Route 100 and Illinois Route 106 across the Illinois River just east of Florence, Illinois, hence the name. The bridge is the middle of the three crossings on IL 100, with the other two in Hardin (South of Florence) and Beardstown (North of Florence). From its opening in 1929 until 1991, it carried US Route 36 and IL 100. In 1991, Interstate 72 and the Valley City Eagle Bridges were completed six miles upstream, and US 36 was signed onto I-72, with the old route signed as IL 106 (IL 100 was not rerouted). The bridge was rehabilitated in 1981, and again in 2004. The second time, the bridge was closed due to the need to replace the deck. Traffic was detoured to I-72. In 2012, the bridge's lifting mechanism that allows barge traffic to pass under the bridge had serious problems, and continued use could affect the structural integrity of the span. Therefore, the span was raised and the bridge closed for 9 months for repairs, using I-72 as a detour. The bridge reopened on April 22, 2013.

<doc id="36660238" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36660238" title="MV Daronia">
MV Daronia

MV "Daronia" was a 1930s British oil tanker owned by Anglo-Saxon Petroleum, a British subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. She was launched in July 1938 by Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn on Tyneside in England and was completed in February 1939. She was one of a class of 20 similar tankers built for Anglo-Saxon.
In 1944 "Daronia" survived being hit by two German torpedoes, and in 1958 she survived being hit by a bomb in an air raid by the CIA. Shell withdrew "Daronia" from service in 1960 and she was scrapped in November of that year.
Torpedoed and repaired.
On 18 August 1944 "Daronia" left the Port of Durban, Union of South Africa, in ballast and with a partial deck cargo of empty oil drums and general cargo. She was part of Convoy DN-68, sailing northwards in the Indian Ocean for dispersal further up the coast of East Africa. At 1941 hrs on 20 August "Daronia" was between South Africa and Madagascar at a position of 31.10°S, 38°E when the "Kriegsmarine" Type IXD U-boat commanded by "Korvettenkapitän" Jürgen Oesten hit her with two torpedoes. These did not sink "Daronia" and she returned safely to Durban, where she arrived on 26 August remained for the remainder of the War. After the War she was repaired and in February 1946 she was returned to service.
Bombed by the CIA.
On 28 April 1958 "Daronia" was in Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo when a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, attacked the Shell oil terminal there. The Invader bombed a larger tanker, Eagle Oil and Shipping's , setting her on fire and sinking her, and then attacked "Daronia".
"Daronia" and her sister ships had unusually high ventilators for their mid-ship pump rooms. The B-26 dropped a bomb that hit her port ventilator, but instead of exploding it bounced off towards her starboard ventilator and then fell harmlessly into the sea. "Daronia" had a full load of petrol, so if the bomb had detonated the effects would almost certainly have been devastating.
As a consequence "Daronia" left Balikpapan that same day for the safety of Singapore, taking with her 26 of "San Flaviano"s rescued crew. A further 24 crew from "San Flaviano" followed a few days later on another Anglo-Saxon tanker, . Shell also evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore and suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan.
In June 1958 both the Indonesian and UK governments claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels. In fact only the radio operator was from the Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi. The B-26, its bombs and its pilot, former USAAF officer William H Beale, Jr were sent by the CIA as part of US covert support for the rebellion. The CIA pilots had orders to target foreign merchant ships in order to drive foreign trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and destabilising the Indonesian government of President Sukarno. Shell's suspension of operations and partial evacuation of personnel was exactly what the CIA attack was intended to achieve.
For some months previously, UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd had supported US policy to supply Permesta. On 6 May 1958, more than a week after the CIA sank "San Flaviano" and hit "Daronia", Lloyd secretly told US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that this was still his position. On 18 May, Indonesian forces shot down a different Permesta B-26 and captured it its CIA pilot, Allen Pope. Nevertheless, in June 1958 both Indonesia and the UK publicly claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels, concealing the CIA involvement of which both governments were well aware.
Withdrawal and scrapping.
"Daronia" remained in Shell service until 1960. In November of that year she was scrapped in British Hong Kong.

Conroy Virtus

The Conroy Virtus was a proposed American large transport aircraft, designed by John M. Conroy of the Turbo-Three Corporation for use by NASA to transport the Space Shuttle. While the project was seriously considered, it proved impractically large, and the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft was developed instead.
History.
The Space Shuttle was originally designed to utilize on-board turbofan engines for propulsion within the atmosphere, both upon re-entry and for ferry flights between landing sites, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range, or contingency landing sites such as Easter Island, to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. When the air-breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. One early design for a shuttle carrier aircraft was proposed by John M. Conroy, developer of the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy oversized cargo aircraft, in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center; named Virtus, a contract was issued for design and development work in 1974.
Expected to cost US$12.5 million each, Virtus was a twin-fuselage design powered by four large jet engines; it was intended for these to be Pratt & Whitney JT9D turbofans. Conroy proposed extensive use of 'off the shelf' military parts in the design to reduce costs; this included the use of fuselages from Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers to form the aircraft's main fuselage pods, added to the new-design wing and tail section. The Space Shuttle Orbiter would be carried under the center section of the Virtus aircraft's wing, between the fuselages; other large cargos, including the Space Shuttle external tank, the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, or dedicated cargo pods, could be alternatively carried.
The Virtus design was tested in the NASA Langley wind tunnel; while the results of the wind tunnel tests were considered promising, the drawbacks of such a large design, including the cost of developing an entirely new aircraft, flight testing the design, and the sheer size of the aircraft requiring the development and/or expansion of infrastructure to support it, militated against further development of Virtus. The Lockheed Corporation, which had proposed a twin-fuselage version of its C-5 Galaxy airlifter to carry the Shuttle, also saw its proposal rejected for the same reasons. A more modest conversion of existing C-5s was proposed, and nearly taken up by NASA, but it was determined that having aircraft continually available was preferable to being restricted by the United States Air Force on the use of C-5s, and Boeing's proposal for a conversion of the 747 airliner was selected, becoming the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. A proposed commercial version of the Virtus design, named Colossus, also failed to gain any further interest, and the Virtus design was abandoned.

Public Interest Registry

The Public Interest Registry is a Reston, Virginia-based not-for-profit created by the Internet Society (ISOC) in 2002 to manage the .ORG top-level domain. It took over operation of .ORG in January 2003 and officially applied for the .NGO domain in May 2012. The organization is involved in internet policy, education and security issues, like the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol, domain tasting, DNS filtering and internet adoption in third world countries.
History.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) circulated a request for proposals in May 2002 for a new organization to manage the .ORG domain. The Internet Society (ISOC) put forth one of eleven proposals ICANN received. ISOC won an endorsement within ICANN and was recommended to the selection committee in a preliminary report. At a public ICANN meeting in Bucharest in 2002, ISOC CEO Lynn St. Amour and Afilias CTO Ram Mohan presented ISOC's proposal to manage the .ORG registry. The proposal included the creation of a separate entity, called the Public Interest Registry, to oversee the .ORG domain. Its board of directors is appointed by ISOC. Afilias was selected as the back-end technical provider for .ORG under contract with the Public Interest Registry. The largest domain transfer in history occurred on January 1, 2003, when ICANN had VeriSign delegate 2.6 million domains to the Public Interest Registry. An Internet Society Vice President, David Maher, became the chairman. The following month, Ed Viltz became the organization’s first CEO.
On June 23, 2010, The Public Interest Registry implemented the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol for .ORG. DNSSEC is intended to prevent cache poisoning attacks by making sure internet users arrive at the URL they intended. The implementation began in test environments in mid-2009. The protocol was implemented by PIR's technical partner Afilias during the tenure of former CEO, Alexa Raad, who played a role in creating the DNSSEC Industry Coalition. Raad resigned from the Public Interest Registry in late 2010. The non-profit had an interim CEO, until it recruited former Afilias executive Brian Cute as its third chief executive officer on January 14, 2011.
After the 2011 tsunami in Japan, the Public Interest Registry waived renewal fees for Japan-based .ORG domains to prevent domains from expiring due to intermittent internet access.
Domains.
.ORG.
.ORG is the third largest generic top-level domain of the Domain Name System used in the internet. .ORG domains have been registered by the Public Interest Registry since 2003. Craigslist.org and Wikipedia.org are among the more popular .ORG users. Since 2009, the Public Interest Registry has published a bi-annual report called “The Dashboard” on the number of registered .ORG domains. There were more than 8 million registered .ORGs in 2009, 8.8 million in 2010, and 9.6 million in 2011. The Public Interest Registry registered the ten millionth .ORG domain in June, 2012.
The Public Interest Registry promotes and publicizes the .ORG domain. While .ORG is an open domain, the Public Interest Registry wants more people to view .ORG as a domain for communities and entities that serve the public good, rather than being perceived as directed to non-profits. In 2010, the Public Interest Registry launched “WhyIChose.org” as part of campaign to promote the .ORG domain extension.
It conducted a survey of consumers in 2011 on how domain names are perceived by internet users. The survey found that 81 percent of Americans still rely on an organization’s website before Twitter or Facebook. It also suggested .ORG sites were seen as more trustworthy. Respondents were more likely to turn to .ORG websites in a crisis, more likely to post content on .ORG sites and to trust information on a .ORG domain. It also found that younger age groups were almost twice as likely to register a .ORG as Americans age 55-64.
.NGO.
In June 2011, ICANN expanded the internet’s naming system to allow applications for new top-level domain names. The Public Interest Registry declared publicly an interest in the .NGO domain in August 2011 and applied for it in May 2012. It also applied for an equivalent domain, .ONG, which stands for “Organisation Non Gouvernementale” in French, and is also recognizable in Spanish, Italian and other romance languages. Unlike the .ORG domain, .NGO will require validation of the registrant’s non-governmental status. Non-governmental organizations told the Public Interest Registry they needed a closed domain that validated the legitimacy of websites accepting online donations to avoid fraud. The Public Interest Registry plans to use the funds from selling .NGO domains to develop an “NGO Community Program” to reach out to NGOs in developing nations. It also intends to create a directory service of NGOs to support their SEO and visibility, and develop a closed community for NGOs to learn from each other.
Advocacy.
The Public Interest Registry often supports ICANN on policy and privacy issues on the internet. In 2003, The Public Interest Registry wrote a letter to ICANN supporting its opposition of wildcard redirection services that automatically redirect internet users to correct spelling errors and typos. The letter supported ICANN’s request for VeriSign to voluntarily suspend a DNS wildcard service called Site Finder and asked ICANN to make a policy against similar services across the internet. The Public Interest Registry and other organizations opposed the move by VeriSign, because automatic redirects may affect spam filters and mail servers that rely on error messages from non-existent domains.
The Public Interest Registry reduced domain tasting by charging fees to registrants that cancel 90 percent of their domains in less than five days. In 2007, ICANN used that as a model for a similar proposal to curb domain tasting through non-refundable fees. The Public Interest Registry supported ICANN’s expansion of top-level domain names. The CEO, Brian Cute, commented that internet users will still gravitate towards established domain names, but new domains will target specific communities. The Public Interest Registry has also urged ICANN to address privacy implications of the WHOIS database. The organization is critical of the security of DNS filtering techniques and supports the DNSSEC protocol. It also shuts down .ORG-based phishing scams.

Peter Toms (painter)

Peter Toms RA (fl. 1748, died 1 January 1777) was an English painter, specialising in depicting drapery for the works of other artists. He was a foundation member of the Royal Academy.
Life.
Toms was the son of an engraver, William Henry Toms, of Masham Street, Westminster. Apprenticed to the portraitist Thomas Hudson, he became a drapery-painter, and worked for Francis Cotes for several years. After Cotes' death, he was employed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Zoffany amongst others. He also held the post of Port Culis Pursuivant. at the College of Heralds. 
According to Edward Edwards:Among the pictures which he did for Sir Joshua, are some very excellent; and candour must allow, that many of Sir Joshua's best whole-lengths are those, to which Toms painted the draperies: Among these was the picture of Lady Elizabeth Keppel, in the dress she wore as bride-maid to the Queen ; for which he was paid the sum of twelve guineas, a very slender price in proportion to the merit of the piece, but Sir Joshua was not remarkably liberal upon these occasions, of which circumstance Mr. Toms did not neglect to complain.
James Northcote, though he considered Toms "a very good drapery painter" felt that his rather heavy manner was out of sympathy with Reynolds' style.
Toms was a foundation member of the Royal Academy in 1768. He exhibited three works at the academy: "An allegorical picture". in 1769, "A portrait; half length" in 1779 and "The burdock and other wild plants; a specimen of a work to be published" in 1771.
Despite his success as a drapery painter, his heavy drinking and a lack of prudence in other respects, kept him poor, and prevented his advancement in the College of Heralds. He attempted suicide by cutting his own throat; the wound did not however prove fatal and he survived for several years, dying in poverty at his lodging in Rathbone Place in London, on 1 January 1777. He was buried in the cemetery of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.
He married Mary, daughter of Robert Hogg, of Kincardine. She died about three years before him, and was buried at Marylebone, the parish in which he lived many years.

<doc id="36660516" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36660516" title="Murder of Tia Sharp">
Murder of Tia Sharp

The murder of Tia Sharp was a high-profile English case in which a 12-year-old girl, Tia Sharp (30 June 2000 – 2 August 2012), was reported missing from the home of her grandmother in New Addington, London, in August 2012.
When police discovered her body in the loft of the house seven days later, they arrested Christine Sharp and her partner Stuart Hazell on suspicion of murder. Hazell is a former boyfriend of Tia's mother. Hazell was charged with Tia's murder on 12 August.
Five days into his trial at the Old Bailey in May 2013, Hazell changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the judge setting a minimum term of 38 years.
Disappearance.
Hazell told police that Tia had left the house on 3 August 2012 to travel to Croydon, five miles away, to buy shoes in the Whitgift Centre. On 7 August, Tia's uncle, David Sharp, made a televised plea for her safe return. Fifty-five sightings were reported by members of the public, but none were substantiated. Eighty police officers were assigned to the search, and 800 hours of CCTV footage were collected.
Investigation.
On 10 August, a body was discovered in a black bed sheet in a black bag in the loft of Tia's grandmother Christine Sharp's home, after police searched it for the fourth time. Police launched a search for Hazell, and later that day arrested him at Cannon Hill Common, Morden, on suspicion of murder, after a tip-off from a member of the public. It was later announced that two further arrests had been made: Christine Sharp, on suspicion of murder, and her neighbour, Paul Meehan, on suspicion of assisting an offender.
Meehan and Sharp were subsequently bailed. Commander Neil Basu, the officer in charge of the investigation, apologised to Tia's mother for the delay in finding her daughter's body. He blamed human error and said that a review would be undertaken "to ensure such a failing is not repeated".
Late in the evening of 11 August, Hazell was charged with the murder of Tia Sharp. He appeared before Camberwell Green magistrates' court on 13 August via video-link. No plea was entered and the case was committed to the Old Bailey for trial, with a first appearance on 15 August, also via video-link, and a preliminary hearing set for 19 November.
He was remanded in custody to Belmarsh prison where he was kept in isolation for his own safety.
A post-mortem on the body was begun on 10 August, and paused later that day. By 16 August, the post-mortem had still not been completed, but at an inquest into the death, which opened that day, it was confirmed that the body was that of Tia Sharp. The post-mortem later concluded without establishing the cause of death. Experts told "This is Croydon Today" that the delay in finding the body will have made it much harder to establish the cause of death, and that without a cause of death the prosecution will find it much harder to build a case. However, detectives suspected and it was widely reported that Tia Sharp was smothered, although this was not officially proven to be the cause of death.
On 23 August police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe addressed his force's failure to find Tia's body. He said that the error could not be attributed to a single officer. He wanted "to understand what processes and management decisions we've made that led to that failure." He hoped to have answers within a few weeks, and again apologised to Tia's family.
Tia Sharp was cremated on 14 September, after a private family funeral.
Court proceedings.
It was announced on 26 November that Stuart Hazell would face trial in May 2013. 
On 7 December, the Metropolitan Police announced that Tia Sharp's grandmother would not face charges.
On 5 February 2013, Meehan was charged with wasting police time. He appeared at Croydon magistrates' court on 28 February 2013, where he denied the charge against him and was released on bail for a one-day trial on 29 July. 
Hazell pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court on 8 March 2013.
The trial of Stuart Hazell began on 7 May 2013 before Mr Justice Nicol. On 13 May, Hazell changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment on 14 May with a tariff of 38 years, meaning he will be 75 years old before he is eligible for parole. 
On 5 August 2013, Paul Meehan was found guilty of wasting police time and sentenced to five months in prison. 
Aftermath.
In June 2013, Steven Carter announced that he was going to be a father again as his girlfriend was pregnant.
In July 2013, Tia's biological father Steven Carter said he backed a plan for websites to be told to block certain search terms and warn people when they try to view illegal content.
In November 2013, partly in response to the murders of Tia Sharp and April Jones, the search engines Google and Bing modified their systems to block results from searches aimed at producing child abuse images.

Peter Reardon

Peter Reardon is a recording artist, music producer and professional audio equipment manufacturer. Peter grew up in Houston, Texas, where he was heavily involved in the "punk" rock scene of the 1980s. Peter began his own musical career in the middle of the decade as the singer for the little-known band Crowd Control where he first explored song writing and developed his own stage presence. Peter was hired by the infamous Rap-a-Lot records and was an engineer and\or mixer on several Geto Boys records as well as a number of solo projects for individual band members. For his efforts at Rap-A-Lot, he earned his first gold record from the RIAA. Peter continued to work with Rap-A-Lot through the early 90's until leaving for Los Angeles to pursue other recording opportunities.
The 90's saw Reardon producing and engineering for a large variety of bands in the U.S. and Mexico. Peter was for a time president of Waxploitation records. During the 90's, he created several of his own pieces of recording equipment. This eventually led him to found Shadow Hills Industries around the year 2000. Subsequently, he moved the company and himself back to Texas settling in the Austin area.
On October 13, 2011, Reardon made a little seen appearance outside industry conferences when he was interviewed on Pensado’s Place. In the interview Peter discusses his past work, his philosophy on creating equipment and music production. Peter also discusses his affinity for secrets and how he has the ability to allow the company that sells his equipment to deal with customers allowing him to use the company website to do something other than sell product. Dave Pensado goes on to say that Shadow Hills equipment has become an industry standard.

Saint Cyllin

Saint Cyllin was a legendary, and possibly historical British king of the 1st century AD, early Christian saint and the last pendragon of Great Britain. His existence is based on very limited evidence.
Richard Williams Morgan claimed that a reference to him as a son of Caratacus was found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant and used this as evidence of early entry of Christianity to Britain; ""Cyllin ab Caradog, a wise and just king. In his days many of the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain, and many godly men from the countries of Greece and Rome were in Cambria. He first of the Cymry gave infants names; for before, names were not given except to adults, and then from something characteristic in their bodies, minds, or manners.""
Reference to Saint Cyllin is also given in Iolo Morganwg's "Third series" of forged Welsh Triads. He is also discussed in the works of Rice Rees, Jane Williams, Sabine Baring-Gould and John Williams (Ab Ithel) as brother of Saint Eigen and father of King Coel. He is also noted in a manuscript giving the genealogy of Taliesin from the collection of Thomas Hopkin of Coychurch along with one from the Havod Uchtryd collection where he is called Cynan, a name often associated with Conan Meriadoc.

Among the Sleep

Among the Sleep is a first-person survival horror adventure video game developed by Krillbite Studios for Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Linux. Among the Sleep was released on 29 May 2014 in North America and Europe.
Plot.
The story begins as a two-year-old toddler is having his birthday celebration at home with his mother (voiced by Cia Court). The celebration is interrupted by a visitor at the front door who is hidden from the player, but the story suggests it is the player's father, with whom the mother has separated. The conversation is muffled and, partly, kept from the player as the mother raises her voice, refusing the father's request to see his son. The mother's angry tone frightens the toddler, whose fear is presented as blurred vision. Quickly, the mother returns with a gift. It is suggested to be from the father, but the mother doesn't tell who the gift is from. Instead, she carries the child and gift upstairs to the two-year-old's bedroom, a place of bright, warm colours and streaming sunlight. Before the present is opened, the telephone rings, and the mother leaves her son in his bedroom to play alone. The gift is revealed to be a hand-me-down teddy bear, which appears to be alive in the two-year-old's eyes. The bear (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) introduces himself as Teddy and has a friendly, curious nature. After a few minutes playing together, they go into the closet, where the toddler's imagination translates the closet into a much larger, dark room filled with long, black coats. Teddy explains that if the child gets scared in the dark, he can hug Teddy to feel more safe. The small adventure is ended by the mother finding them; she tells the child, gently, to 'stop hiding from mummy' and puts the two-year-old to bed. The toddler wakes in the night to find Teddy being taken by an invisible entity, and the cot is overturned, again by an unseen hand. The player leaves the bedroom, and rescues Teddy from drowning in a washing machine. The bear says that 'something is not right', and that they need to find mother, who is somehow missing.
The search translates into a journey through environments created by the child's imagination. The landscapes' eerie design and monstrous threats suggest a psychological insight into the child's coping with his parents' break up, as well as the mother's abusive treatment. Teddy instructs the player to find four memories the child had of happier times with his mother, that will lead them to her. The memories take the forms of four objects the child associates with his mother: Her pendant from her necklace shown at the start of the game, the music box she plays to put him to sleep at night, a story book, and the boy's toy pink elephant.
Recurring themes found in the imaginary places include the child's toys, items from the family home, places the child has presumably visited, bottles of alcohol implicitly telling that the mother has a drinking problem, drawings made by the child (some showing the parents fighting over ownership of their son, and others of the mother scaring the toddler), and a shadow-like monster that torments the player. The troll-like monster is an echo of lullaby "Trollmors vaggsång", hummed by the mother to lull the child to sleep.
After the last memory is found, the child and Teddy are captured by a coated monster and in the ensuing struggle, Teddy's arm is torn off. With all of the memories found, the child exits the closet and is back in his own room. He heads downstairs to find his mother crying in the kitchen, a damaged Teddy in one hand, a wine bottle in the other, revealing that the "monster" during the game was the mother losing her temper during her drunken moments. When the player attempts to retrieve the bear, the mother knocks her child over and shouts at the player to 'get away' before showing signs of remorse. The mother apologizes and tells the toddler she 'didn't mean to', and that 'it's all too much', implying that she was struggling as a single mother.
There is a knock at the front door that the mother doesn't react to; instead, she continues crying. When the toddler goes to the door, it opens and reveals a glowing white light, representing happiness and safety, with the player meeting the unseen father off-screen.

Edwin Pugh

Edwin William Pugh (1874 - February 5, 1930) was an English writer. He published 33 books, primarily novels and short story collections, and focused on working-class "cockney school" storylines. After positive reviews of his first two books, "A Street in Suburbia" (1895) (a collection of short stories, published when he was 21 years old) and "The Man of Straw" (1896), he quit his job as a clerk to write full-time. After a few years of good fortune, however, Pugh's working class output lost favor, and he struggled with poverty for the rest of his life. He died in London on February 5, 1930.
The Modernist Journals Project finds that "Pugh's fiction largely goes unread today, and those critics who have read him generally accuse him of sentimentality and melodrama." He also wrote literary criticism praising the works of Charles Dickens.

<doc id="36660844" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36660844" title="Bernard Gates">
Bernard Gates

Bernard Gates (The Hague, 23 April 1686-North Aston, 15 November 1773, aged 87) was an English composer, and a bass singer employed by Handel in his oratorios. He was director of the choir at Westminster Abbey from 1740 to 1757. Surviving music, in a conservative style, includes six anthems and a morning service.
Life.
He was the second son of Bernard Gates, gentleman, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. His name appears in the list of children of the Chapel Royal in 1702. At the end of 1708 he was sworn a gentleman of the Chapel Royal in the place of J. Howell, who died on 15 July in that year. He held the sinecure office of tuner of the regals at court, and was a member of the choir of Westminster Abbey. 
At some time before 1732 Gates was made master of the children of the Chapel Royal. On 23 February 1732 Handel's "Esther" was performed at Gates's house in James Street, Westminster, by the children of the chapel. The same singers sang the work at a subscription concert at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, and again at the room in Villiers Street, York Buildings.
In 1734 Gates seceded from the Academy of Vocal Music, taking the children of the chapel with him. He had been a prominent member of the society from its inauguration. Gates sang one of the airs in the first performance of the "Dettingen Te Deum" in 1743. John Hawkins states that says that Gates introduced into the Chapel the system of solmisation by hexachords.
Death.
In 1737 (10 March) Mrs. Gates died, and in 1758 Gates moved to North Aston, Oxfordshire. He died there on 15 November 1773, and was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey on the 23rd of the month. The inscription on his monument, a source for his family information, gives his age as eighty-eight. A tablet to his memory was put up in the church of North Aston, at the expense of his pupil, Thomas Sanders Dupuis.
Family.
Gates married before 1717, since on 6 June of that year his eldest child, a daughter named Atkinson, was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey. This unusual Christian name, which was borne by another daughter of Gates (buried 1736), was derived from a Mrs. Atkinson, who had been laundress to Queen Anne, and who had brought up Mrs. Gates, and made her her heiress.

Murād Mīrzā

Murād Mīrzā (?-1574, Arabic مراد ميرزا) was the 36th Imam of the Nizari Ismaili Shia community. He was a politically active Imam, possibly alongside the Nuqtavi Shia group, and had a large following in Persia, Sind and parts of India.
Capture and execution.
Murād Mīrzā did not always operate from the Nizari base of Anjudan. As a result of his activeness, he acquired followers in Kashan and other central Persian areas. In 1573, due to the threat posed by the Imam, the 2nd Safavid monarch, Shah Tahmasp, ordered the governor of Hamadan, Amir Khan Musilu, to go to Anjudan to capture Murad Mirza. Amir Khan proceeded to Anjudan, and while killing a large number of the Imam's followers and taking much booty, was unable to capture him. However, the Imam was soon captured and imprisoned, but again escaped, this time with the aid of a sympathetic high-ranking Safavid official named Muhammad Muqim. With the help of his followers from Fars, Makran and Sind, the Imam was able to escape to Kandahar. However, while in Afghanistan, he was once again captured by the Safavids. This time there would be no escape, and after being brought before Shah Tahmasp he was executed alongside Muhammad Muqim in 1574.

Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (CMAFS) at the Rocky Mountains' Front Range is 1 of 4 military installations in the region of Colorado Springs, Colorado (cf. Fort Carson, Peterson AFB, Schriever AFB, USAFA). Near the west of the station are the Cheyenne Mountain antenna farm on the private summit and Pike National Forest farther west (104° 52' West longitude) which has the USGS-defined Cheyenne Mountain summit.
Structures outside of the nuclear bunker include the parking lots and roads, a heliport , and buildings such as a racquetball facility, the fire station (), and both the portals for the blast tunnel. A military gate limits NORAD Road usage from the State Highway 115 interchange, and perimeter signs have warnings, e.g., for state-park hikers (a state-park road intersects with NORAD Road). A fence with warning signs extends on the west side near the Robber's Roost summit.
History.
The installation was construction for NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker at the site. After formation of Space Command in 1982, base services (civil engineering, recreation, etc.) were provided by Air Force Space Command units as part of the "Peterson Complex". The entire installation at Cheyenne Mountain was designated an Air Force Base ("Cheyenne Mountain AFB") by September 1991 and an Air Station ("Cheyenne Mountain AS") by February 1995.
By 2002 the installation was named "Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station".[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Cheyenne+Mountain+Air+Force+Station%22&tbs=nws:1,ar:1&source=newspapers#q=%22Cheyenne+Mountain+Air+Force+Station%22&hl=en&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1994,sbd:1&tbm=nws&ei=QosqUPLlJoLfyAHA34DQCQ&start=60&sa=N&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=1ab4ea18c414424a&biw=1600&bih=737] The Combat Operations Center was placed on "warm standby" by 2008 and in 2011, the fire station building was added to the GNIS.

The Wizard of Karres

The Wizard of Karres is a novel by Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint, and Dave Freer that was published by Baen Books in 2004, as a sequel to The Witches of Karres by James H. Schmitz.
The book uses the same characters as the original novel, and starts about where the original ended. The story describes how Captain Pausert is found to have klatha (psionic) powers that increase over the course of the story, where he is called a witch, a "hot witch", and finally a wizard.
Plot Summary.
After safely arriving at the planet Emris at the end of the previous story, Captain Plausert is asked to transport the Natherby sprite Hantis on an important mission so that she can meet with the Empress. Accompanying him is Goth, the Leewit, Hulik do Eldel, and Vezzarn from the original story, along with Pul, Hantis' talking grik-dog. They quickly learn that several groups are after them, presumably attempting to learn the secret of their Sheewash drive, which they have used when they need to escape from a difficult situation.
They eventually learn that their mission is to prevent a plague of nanites from taking control of people. They are being hunted by the ISS (secret service) which is under the influence of the nanites, the remaining gang of Agandar the pirate who is after the drive, and Sedmon, the Daal of Uldune (a planet that caters to pirates and others who have covert needs) who is also after the drive. They land on Vaudevillia, a planet for carnivals, and join up with Petey, Byrum and Keep, "The Greatest Show in the Galaxy." Eventually Agandar's lieutenant catches up with them, and is killed in a sword fight during a Shakespearian play. The Daal of Uldune arrives shortly later, reveals that he has been trying to help them, agrees to fund the carnival, and travels with them.
At one point, Plausert and his group (except Hulik) separate from the carnival and are taken back in time to meet one of Hantis' ancestors. The same nanite plague is happening in that time period, and Plausert is able to stop the plague from spreading. Upon returning to their own time, they are able to meet the empress and stop that plague as well. Plausert learns that the witches of Karres deliberately did not teach him how to use his klatha powers because he had the inherent ability to exceed their capabilities if allowed to learn on his own.

Buddy Richard en el Astor

Buddy Richard en el Astor () is a live album by Chilean singer Buddy Richard. The album was recorded in late 1969 at the Teatro Astor (Astor Theatre) in Santiago with collaborations by the Orchestra of Horacio Saavedra. "Buddy Richard en el Astor" was the first live album ever recorded and released by a Chilean artist. The album was ranked 12th in the Rolling Stone's "Los 50 Mejores Albumes Chilenos" (Best 50 Chilean albums) list.
Background, recording and release.
The late 1960s were a successful time for Buddy Richard, a singer from Graneros, whose professional career started earlier that decade. Some of his songs, including "Quiera Dios" ("May God Want To"), "Amor Por Tí" ("Love for You"), and "Con Mi Bombo y Mi Chinchín" ("With My Drum and My Rattle") sold very well and received high airplay in Chilean radios.
In late November–early December 1969, Buddy Richard performed his greatest hits at the Teatro Astor in Santiago, in a concert which was broadcast via radio and television. Thirty-eight orchestral performers from the Orquesta de Horacio Saavedra (Orchestra of Horacio Saavedra) collaborated.
Following his performance at the Teatro Astor, Buddy Richard began a national tour to promote the first live album ever recorded by a Chilean. The album was very popular and sold well. "Buddy Richard en el Astor" "became a point of reference" to other Chilean artists, which included José Alfredo Fuentes and Gloria Simonetti.
On 31 March 2003, the album was re-issued in compact disc format under the title "Buddy Richard y la orquesta de Horacio Saavedra en vivo" (Buddy Richard and the Orchestra of Horacio Saavedra Live) by Warner Music Chile. Four years later, in April 2008, "Buddy Richard en el Astor" was ranked the twelfth best Chilean album ever by the "Rolling Stone" magazine.

List of DuPont Experimental Station inventions

The DuPont Experimental Station is the main research and development site of DuPont. It is a major component of the DuPont Historic Corridor, a section of Delaware Route 141 that traces the history of both the Du Pont family and the DuPont company. The site map is shown in the Figure and the buildings are numbered. The map is not fixed in time in that not all of the building shown existed in the same time frame. Some were demolished before other were built.
The site was initiated along the banks of the Brandywine River so the lowest numbers are in the lower left of the map. Expansion has taken place toward the upper right, slowly displacing the DuPont Country Club, so those are the more modern buildings and the more recent history of the site. Each of the business units of the company have had research facilities at the Experimental Station, so the inventions listed below reflect the nature of the research carried out in each building.

Central Executive Committee of the Pakistan Peoples Party

The Central Executive Committee of the Pakistan Peoples Party of Pakistan (Urdu: سنٹرل ایگزیکٹو كميٹى; otherwise known as Core Committee, is an apex and "De jure" supreme governing authority of Pakistan Peoples Party— a centre-left and democratic socialist political party. The central committee directed and supervised all party policies and government activities (if only in power) at central government and provisional level. Its executive officer consists of chairman (as well co-chairman at present) and numbers of presidents, vice-presidents, and vice-chairmen. The central committee may appoints many of the most powerful people in the country, including general-secretaries, presidents, vice-presidents of the party.
In party's hierarchy, the central executive committee is the highest and powerful governing authority and it has final jurisdiction over all the party decision. During the times of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, it acted as the highest party authority and had control over the enforcement of all economic, scientific, industrial, public and social policies in the country. During the 1980s, it served as the ground base and the ideological headquarter of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD) to take down the anti-Soviet and far-right US-baked military dictatorship of General Zia-ul-Haq. The number of its members are vary and the central executive committee does not have any limitations as it goes to the membership of the party. The central committee coordinates activities between Federal Councils and Provisional Presidium and Secretariat Generals at the provisional levels. It is the highest organ of Party's structural leadership and plays a minor role in government policy formations and enforcement. The central executive committee is currently headquartered in the People's Secretariat at the Parliament House where executive and finals decisions are made and enforced as party's policy. However, when party is in the opposition, it usually headquartered in 70 Clifton in Karachi where the party leadership usually gathered and meet there for its strategies for the coming elections.
The Secretariat-General of the Central Executive Committee.
The Secretariat-General of the Central Executive Committee is currently headquartered in the People's Secretariat at the Parliament where the key decisions are made by the vice-chairmen and co-chairman. The central executive committee (CEC) is chaired and directed by an elected and designated chairman (or either co-chairman) who convened all the party meeting at higher level, usually chairman's decision is considered final decision. As of current contemporary situation, President Asif Ali Zardari is the serving co-chairman and currently assisted by three appointed vice-chairmen, eight provisional presidents and eight secretariat-generals of the party, all of them are appointed by the co-chairman.

Rise of the Triad (2013 video game)

Rise of the Triad is a first-person shooter developed by Interceptor Entertainment and published by Apogee Software. It was released on July 31, 2013. The game is a revival of the original "Rise of the Triad", which 3D Realms published as Apogee Software Ltd. in 1995.
Gameplay.
The gameplay has been touted as a throwback to classic first person shooters of the 1990s such as its predecessor. It features non-linear level design, a high rate of player movespeed, multiple playable characters and an arsenal of over the top explosive weaponry. The game consists of 20 levels (plus four secret levels) spread across four episodes as well as an online multiplayer component which features Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes.
Plot.
The plot is nearly identical to that of the original "Rise of the Triad: Dark War" wherein a team of special operatives, known as the H.U.N.T. (High-risk United Nations Task-force) is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate terrorist activity taking place. When their boat is destroyed by patrols, the team soon learns that the 'Triad' plans to nuke nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return from whence they came, are left to fight their way into the heart of the island to put a stop to the Triad's activities once and for all.
Development.
Development of "Rise of the Triad" began in January 2012. Originally planned as an HD remake, Interceptor instead decided to assemble a global virtual team to begin a full re-imagining of the original. The game was revealed for the first time at QuakeCon 2012 and released one year later at QuakeCon 2013. It is said development was completed on an extremely tight budget and that much of said budget went toward acquiring licenses for Apogee's Rise of the Triad IP and Epic's Unreal Engine 3. Interceptor announced that the game became profitable within its first week of sales.
Reception.
The game has so far received an average review score of 68/100. While critics enjoyed its adherence to classic FPS speed, gameplay and difficulty; they also found the first person platforming, level design coupled with an unforgiving checkpoint system to be more frustrating than challenging and concluded that some elements were perhaps better left in the past. However, quicksaves have since been introduced using a patch.

Polen Special

The Polen Special, is a homebuilt racing aircraft built to become the fastest four cylinder aircraft in the world.
Development.
The Polen Special, (Also known as the Polen Special II) development started in October 1967 by Dennis Polen and Darryl Usher. The project to build a fast single seat racer larger than Formula One limitations began as a retractable gear Midget Mustang modification. After reviewing engine installation shortcomings, a clean sheet design was started. The Polen Special was then designed around a Piper Comanche engine and cowling, which also had design issues with engine canting and required cowling modifications for a single engine installation. A new clean sheet Lycoming IO-360 installation came afterward. Two sets of retractable landing gear were built and tested, but were sold to other homebuilders. Over time, the RayJay turbocharger was removed due to hunting and composite ailerons were installed. The aircraft was sold by Polen to Richard C. Keyt and has been modified several times to increase efficiency and safety. A composite rudder replaced the all-metal rudder that fluttered to destruction at 2500 engine RPM and a modern turbocharger was installed. Keyt and partner Jack Zimmanck formed the Polen Company to develop aircraft technologies with the Polen Special as a flying testbed. A design modification called the "Stage 3" is underway incorporate further improvements.
Design.
The Polen Special is a low-wing monoplane with retractable conventional landing gear. The retractable gear is hydraulically operated from a T-33 sequencing valve with electric powered gear doors. The fuselage and wings are all aluminum with flush riveting. The ailerons and elevators use push-pull tubes, with cable control for the rudders. The aircraft is specifically designed to fly at high altitude on IFR routes with the pilot using supplemental oxygen to achieve maximum speed with the turbocharged engine.

Kartinah

Kartinah is a now-lost 1940 romance film from the Dutch East Indies that was written directed by Andjar Asmara. The film, Andjar's directorial debut, follows a nurse and her superior as they fall in love in the Air Raid Preparation team. Produced by The Teng Chun's New Java Industrial Film, "Kartinah" was heavily subsidised by the country's government and through product placement. Although it was a critical failure, the new actors signed with the studio for "Kartinah" gave New Java Industrial Film increased production capabilities.
Plot.
Suria (Astaman), a commander at the Air Raid Preparation team (, or LBD), has fallen in love with the nurse Kartinah (Ratna Asmara), who serves with the LBD. However, he is married to Titi (Tante Han), a woman who has lost her sanity. Although Suria's uncle (R. Inoe Perbatasari) suggests that Suria take Kartinah as a second wife, Kartinah refuses, as she considers herself a modern woman and not bound by traditional practices.
In an airstrike, Titi is heavily wounded; the presence of danger jolts her mind enough that she regains her sanity. She explains that she and Suria have long been sleeping in different beds, and expresses hope that Kartinah will be willing to take him as her husband. Kartinah and her childhood friend, Dr. Rasyid (Rasjid Manggis), try unsuccessfully to save Titi's life. Afterwards Kartinah agrees to marry Suria.
Production.
Andjar Asmara, who directed "Kartinah", had previous experience as the editor-in-chief of the film magazine "Doenia Film" (1929–1930) and dramatist for the theatrical group Dardanella. He was invited to direct by The Teng Chun, an ethnic Chinese film producer and head of Java Industrial Film; Andjar also wrote the film's script. Several cast members were drawn from the Dardanella troupe, including Astaman, Ali Yugo, and M. Rasjid Manggis, while R. Inoe Perbatasari had formerly worked with Andjar's troupe Bollero. "Kartinah" was Andjar's directorial debut and the film debut of several of its actors.
Andjar and his wife, Ratna, were each given 1,000 gulden for their work, Andjar as director and Ratna as an actress. The couple also received a 10 per cent share of the net profits. This fee, twice that earned by stars for other studios, was made possible by a subsidy from the LBD. Funds from the LBD and Department of Internal Affairs were also used in production, allowing for the filming of expensive effects and scenes, including one with a large fire and the first airstrike in the country's cinema. Despite this, the Indonesian sociologist A. Budi Susanto notes that the film put its love story first, leaving the role of the LBD in the background. Further funds were drawn from product placement: a Singer sewing machine and two local magazines.
"Kartinah" was originally meant to be titled "Kartini". However, this proved controversial owing to the title's reminiscence of the female emancipation figure, Kartini. Filming began in early 1940 and received the attentions of numerous local groups, who visited the set. The film was in black-and-white.
Release and reception.
"Kartinah" was released in late 1940, during a time of increased intellectualism in local films. Although audiences had high expectations, the academia were later critical of the film; they considered it as nothing more than entertainment, not having any educational value. However, the influx of new talent led Java Industrial Film to expand into different areas, creating subsidiaries for action and mystery films.
The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Dušan Zbavitel

Dušan Zbavitel (7 May 1925 – 7 August 2012) was a world-renowned Czech Indologist.
Life.
Dušan Zbavitel studied Indology with Professor Vincenc Lesný at Charles University in Prague in 1945–1948. After defending his CSc (Candidate of Sciences) dissertation in Bengali literature (1954), he started as a researcher at the Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He remained there until being forced out for political reasons in 1971 during the period of Communist "normalization" that followed the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. After 1971, he worked as a freelance translator, and in 1978 he started as a teacher of Sanskrit and Bengali at the School of Languages in Prague. He was active as an author and translator until the last days of his life. He translated from Sanskrit, Pali, Bengali, English and German.
Literary oeuvre.
Zbavitel specialized in Bengali literature, winning international acclaim in this field. His most quoted literary works include a study of East Bengal folk ballads ("Bengali Folk Ballads from Mymensingh and the Question of their Authenticity") and a comprehensive history of Bengali literature ("Bengali Literature") published in 1976 in the prestigious publication "History of Indian Literature" edited by Jan Gonda. In addition to these monographs, the international research community has praised Zbavitel’s numerous magazine articles (of which he wrote more than 100) such as a series of papers on Rabindranath Tagore, the beginnings of modern Bengali drama and studies of "baromasi", a specific genre of medieval and folk Bengali literature. Zbavitel’s prominence in this field is highlighted by his appointment first as a team member for the project "The Dictionary of Oriental Literature" and then as editor-in-chief of its second volume devoted to south Asian literature, which was published in London in 1974.
Zbavitel is the Czech Republic’s best known Indologist. He published a prolific amount despite being out of favor with Czechoslovakia’s totalitarian regime. He authored or co-authored many specialized and popular books and initiated and edited a great number of collective works that still represent the best of Czech Indology. Zbavitel left an indelible trace on Czech culture with his erudite translations from the languages of India, amounting to dozens of books and countless magazine and journal contributions.
Zbavitel educated several generations of Czech Indologists. While still just a researcher at the Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he taught Bengali at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University (1950–1968). He was not permitted to continue for political reasons after 1968, and was only able to return after the fall of the Communist regime (1989). In 1990, he rejoined the faculty, teaching the history of Sanskrit and Bengali literature, ancient Indian poetry and Hinduism and leading courses in the advanced reading of Sanskrit and Bengali texts. He also authored language textbooks and other pedagogical texts.
Zbavitel also translated from English and German. In total, he wrote or translated over 200 books.
Awards and honors.
Zbavitel received many awards at home and in India for his research and translations. He received the Tagore Memorial Award from the Government of West Bengal for his "History of Bengali Literature" in 1977, the title "Lokaratna" for his contribution to folklore research (1981) and the "Rabindratattvacharya" award for his studies on Rabindranath Tagore (1987). In 2006, he received India’s third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan, for his lifetime achievements. His Czech and Czechoslovak awards included the State Award for Translated Work in 2004.
International and Czech Bengalists together published a special edition of the journal "Archiv Orientální" on the occasion of Zbavitel’s 75th birthday.

Bible translations into Uto-Aztecan languages

Uto-Aztecan languages are divided into two groups, Northern and Southern Uto-Aztecan languages. They are spoken in the southwestern United States, north and central Mexico, and in Central America.
Northern Uto-Aztecan.
Ute/Southern Paiute.
Luke's gospel was completed in 2006 and published by Wycliffe Bible Translators.
Shoshone.
Beverly Crum published her translation of Mark into Shoshone in 1986. This was published by the U.S. Center for World Missions
Comanche.
Mark was translated into Comanche language (Uto-Aztecan languages) by Elliot Canonge of Wycliffe Bible Translators, and was published by the American Bible Society in 1958 as "Mark-ha tsaatü narümu'ipü̲."
Northern Paiute.
John and Joy Anderson of Wycliffe Bible Translators published a translation into Northern Paiute of Mark's gospel in 1977 and the whole New Testament in 1985.
Hopi.
The four gospels was published in 1929 by the American Bible Society. The New Testament was first published in 1972. It seems to mainly have been the work of Jonathan Ekstrom and Starlie "Elsie" Polacca.
Southern Uto-Aztecan.
Nahuatl.
Shortly after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, Alonso de Molina translated the "Doctrina christiana" into Nahuatl, which was printed in 1546. The Spanish priest Bernardino de Sahagún attempted to translate the whole Bible into Nahuatl in order to make the Nahua understand the Word of God, but this was forbidden by the Inquisition in Sevilla on 10 May 1576.
It was not until the 20th century that the whole New Testament was translated into this language, when Protestant missionaries, at that time mainly from North America, started to translate the Scriptures into several Native Central American languages. Since then, according to the Summer Institute of Linguistics, the New Testament has been translated into 11 varieties of Nahuatl – Northern Puebla Nahuatl (1979), Sierra Puebla Nahuatl [azz (1979), Tetelcingo Nahuatl (1980), Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl [nhe (1984), Western Huasteca Nahuatl (1986), Guerrero Nahuatl [ngu (1987), Michoacán Nahuatl (1998), Central Huasteca Nahuatl [nch (2005), Northern Oaxaca Nahuatl (2006), Southeastern Puebla Nahuatl [npl (2011), and Zacatlán-Ahuacatlán-Tepetzintla Nahuatl (2012) –, and the whole Bible into the three varieties Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl [nhe (2005), Western Huasteca Nahuatl (2004), and Central Huasteca Nahuatl [nch (2005).
The Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl translation of the whole Bible and most of the Nahuatl translations of the New Testament have been accessible on internet Bible portals since about 2012.
The Protestant Nahuatl Bible translations have been criticized by representatives of the Catholic Church as “full of doctrinal und cultural errors”. After a workshop of Nahuatl-speaking Catholics, mainly priests, from various regions of Mexico, the bishop of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, announced in August of 2012 the formation of a catholic National Nahuatl Commission for a single translation of the whole Bible into Nahuatl, which is to be understood by the speakers of different Nahuatl varieties. However, a date for completion has not been mentioned.
Nawat/Pipil.
The Bible is presently being translated into the Pipil or Nawat language, spoken by a minority in El Salvador. This translation is being done by Alan R. King, a linguist with "Ne Bibliaj Tik Nawat". The Bible is being translated from the original languages. The New Testament is complete, and work is ongoing on the Old Testament.
O'odham.
The New Testament in the O'odham language (Uto-Aztecan family) of the O'odham of the Sonoran Desert of southeastern Arizona and northwest Mexico was translated by Dean and Lucille Saxton of Wycliffe Bible Translators. Work is being done on the Old Testament.
Pima Bajo.
Portions, 1994

Kit, the Arkansas Traveler

Kit, the Arkansas Traveler or Kit, the Arkansas Traveller (or, in its initial version, Down the Mississippi) is a stage play written in 1868 (and later reworked) for the American actor Francis S. Chanfrau. It is one of the landmarks of that century's American genre of border drama.
Creation.
Chanfrau conceived a drama to star himself, and in 1868, he paid $300 to Edward Spencer, generally understood to have been for fulfilling (under the title "Down the Mississippi") Chanfrau's commissioning of such a work. Thomas B. DeWalden did further work on the play, and it opened in Buffalo, N.Y. in the first third of 1869. (By that time it had the title that names the lead character, offering the publicity benefit of evoking the decades-old fiddle tune "The Arkansas Traveler" and a dialogue of the same sort that had generally been associated with the tune; both of those are indeed features of the version that would be taken to New York City.) It was poorly received, however, and Chanfrau prevailed on his friend, theatrical entrepreneur Clifton W. Trayleure, to make further revisions.
The New York opening in May 1871, giving author credit to Spencer and DeWalden, was successful, and he logged some 300 performances across the country, generally crediting either Spencer alone, or Spencer and Trayleure jointly.
Plot.
In the drama, Chanfrau played the hero Kit Redding. His wife and daughter are kidnapped by the villain, a frontier outlaw, in a prologue, or First Act. Between acts, years pass (depending on the performance, 12 years, 20, or perhaps other intervals), including the Civil War, and Kit mourns but grows rich.

<doc id="36661538" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36661538" title="Dawson v. Delaware">
Dawson v. Delaware

Dawson v. Delaware, was a United States Supreme Court decision that ruled that a person's rights of association and due process, as granted under the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, cannot be infringed upon if such an association has no bearing on the case at hand.
Background.
Early in the morning of December 1, 1986, David Dawson and three other inmates escaped from the Delaware Correctional Center at Smyrna. Dawson stole a car and headed south, while the other escapees stole another car and headed north. After burglarizing one home in Kenton, Dawson entered the home of Richard and Madeline Kisner. Dawson tied up Mrs. Kisner, who was at home alone preparing for work, and stabbed her 12 times before taking her car and some money. He was found the next day sleeping in a different stolen car in Milford.
The Delaware Superior Court found Dawson guilty of first-degree murder and several other crimes on June 24, 1988. During the penalty phase, the prosecution planned to present evidence that Dawson belonged to the prison's chapter of the Aryan Brotherhood, including expert testimony about that group, to prove that Dawson's membership was relevant to his crimes. Eventually, Dawson agreed to a stipulation that the Aryan Brotherhood was a white racist group that had its roots in a California prison gang of the same name, in return for the exclusion of expert testimony about the group. The jury concluded that the aggravating factors in the case, including Dawson's prison record, his escape from prison, the fact that he committed the murder adjunct to a second felony, and his association with the Aryan Brotherhood outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court of Delaware upheld the death sentence.
Opinion.
In writing the Court's opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted that the Constitution does not erect a "per se" barrier to the admission of evidence of a person's beliefs and associations during sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment. Rehnquist cited "Barclay v. Florida", , for which he wrote the Court's opinion as an Associate Justice, as a case where such beliefs were material in establishing the murderers' motives. In "Barclay", Elwood Barclay and four other black men, looking to start a race war, killed white hitchhiker Stephen Orlando in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, in 1974. The Supreme Court of Florida imposed the death penalty on Barclay and co-defendant Jacob John Dougan. In 1985, however, the court reversed itself by ordering that Barclay's sentence be commuted to life in prison with eligibility for parole in 25 years and that Dougan be re-sentenced. Dougan was sentenced to death again in 1987 and remains on Florida's Death Row. 
Rehnquist noted that because of the narrowness of the stipulation regarding the Aryan Brotherhood that the Delaware trial court agreed to – that is, because the trial court "did not" seek to provide evidence that the chapter Dawson was associated with was engaged in or endorsed racist activities, or was engaged in or endorsed any other violent or unlawful acts – it violated Dawson's rights under both the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Rehnquist also noted that even if the Aryan Brotherhood chapter "did" hold racist beliefs, elements of racial hatred were absent in this case. Both Dawson and Kisner, the woman he murdered, were white. The Court vacated the sentence against Dawson and remanded the case.
Concurrence.
In his concurrence, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun agreed with the Court's opinion, but specifically noted that the Court did not "require" harmless error review on remand. In the next-to-last paragraph of the Court's opinion, Rehnquist noted that the question of harmless error was not before the Court with regard to the admission of the Aryan Brotherhood stipulation. Blackmun agreed with Rehnquist that the issue of harmless error was best left for Delaware to consider.
Dissent.
In his dissent, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas declared that he believed the Aryan Brotherhood stipulation spoke directly to Dawson's character, and as such the stipulation had relevance at sentencing as an aggravating factor. Thomas noted that even if the prosecution did not introduce specific evidence of the Aryan Brotherhood chapter's activities, the jury could reasonably conclude that Dawson had engaged in some sort of illegal or forbidden activities during his membership in the gang. Thomas cited a 1985 report from the U.S. Department of Justice about prison gangs to illustrate their deviant nature, and the U.S. Court of Appeals case "Jones v. Hamelman" to illustrate that expert testimony was unnecessary to describe a prison gang once its existence was noted.
Thomas believed that the Court was imposing a double standard on the prosecution in this case and future cases by allowing Dawson to present mitigating character evidence during sentencing without explaining such evidence explicitly while not allowing the prosecution to do the same.
Rehnquist acknowledged Thomas's points in the opinion. He wrote that while the state was certainly free to submit aggravating evidence, the stipulation in and of itself could not be viewed as "bad" character evidence in its own right. Rehnquist went further by noting:
Aftermath.
David Dawson was sentenced to death a second time on April 2, 1993. He was executed by lethal injection on April 26, 2001.

He became one of the most successful personalities of South East Europe starting from nothing in 1993, when established its first company. That makes Samir Mane not only one of the most influential businessmen in Western Balkans but a story of success for Albania
Biography.
Samir Mane was born in the southern Albanian city of Korça on 24 December 1967. He was a student of the Faculty of Geology and Mining at Tirana University when the communist system in Albania collapsed. In this new social, economical and political situation he emigrated in Austria looking for a better life.

The beginnings of Mr. Mane business activities started in in 1993 in Vienna where Mane founded Alba Trade. Having started with the trade of electronic devices, soon the Balfin Group, created by Samir Mane managed to create the largest network of electronics stores in Albania, Neptun and then extending the network in the neighboring countries as well. Neptun's chain of stores was positioned from the beginning in 1993 as the main electronics player in the Albanian market supplying the demand with the best brands and latest technology. Today this business created from Mr. Mane counts 14 stores in Albania and more than 17 in Kosova, Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia.

Classical guitar in Cuba

From the 16th to the 19th century.
The guitar (as we know it today or in one of its historical versions) has been present in Cuba since the discovery of the island by Spain. As early as the 16th century, a musician named Juan Ortiz, from the village of Trinidad, is mentioned by famous chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo as “gran tañedor de vihuela y viola” (a great performer of the “vihuela” - a guitar ancestor - and the viol). Another “vihuelista”, Alonso Morón from Bayamo, is also mentioned in the Spanish conquest chronicles in the 16th century.
During the 17th century, Serafín Ramirez mentions a guitarist named Juan Navarro; and in 1722 we find small groups of guitars and “bandolas” in Santa Clara to entertain the population. We also find around this period of time some groups composed by guitars, “bandolas”, flutes and “pífanos” in Santiago de Cuba, which performed during the festivities of San Juan and Santiago Apóstol.
At the end of the 17th century (around 1680) Lucas Pérez de Alaíz, a guitarist from Burgos, Spain, served as Chapel Master of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral.
Domingo and Bartolomé Tamé offered lessons of guitar, singing and violin from 1819 to 1820 in Santiago de Cuba, where also professors Manegat and Bisbé, from Barcelona, taught guitar and singing. In the same city, the Catalan musician Juan Casamitjana offered guitar and singing lessons between 1832 and 1836, and guitarists Francisco Peralta and Juan Antonio Betancourt (disciples of Manegat) acquired great reputation. Also Fabricio Calzado Portuondo became famous as a guitarist and singer in Santiago de Cuba.
A disciple of famous Spanish guitarist Dionisio Aguado, José Prudencio Mungol was the first Cuban guitarist trained in the Spanish guitar tradition. In 1893 he performed at a much acclaimed concert in Havana, after returning from Spain. Mungol actively participated in the musical life of Havana and was a professor at the Hubert de Blanck conservatory.
Other Cuban guitarists from the 19th century are: Joaquín Inciarte (Santiago de Cuba) and Fernando Costa (Camaguey).
The 20th century and beyond.
Severino López was born in Matanzas. He studied guitar in Cuba with Juan Martín Sabio and Pascual Roch, and in Spain with renowned Catalan guitarist Miguel Llobet. He also studied musical composition in Barcelona. After returning to Cuba he founded a music academy in Havana, which he abandoned to establish his permanent residence in Santiago de Cuba. López composed many pieces and numerous transcriptions for the guitar, including one of the famous “La Comparsa” of Ernesto Lecuona. He was the professor of renowned Cuban guitarists José Rey de La Torre and Vicente González-Rubiera (Guyún). Severino López is considered the initiator in Cuba of the guitar school founded by Francisco Tárrega in Spain.
Other important Cuban guitarists from the first half of the 20th century were Ezequiel Cuevas, Francisqueta Vallalta and Félix Guerrero (Sr.).
Clara Romero (1888–1951), founder of the modern Cuban School of Guitar, studied in Spain with Nicolás Prats and in Cuba with Félix Guerrero. She inaugurated the guitar department at the Havana Municipal Conservatory in 1931, where she also introduced the teachings of the Cuban folk guitar style. She created the Guitar Society of Cuba (Sociedad Guitarrística de Cuba) in 1940, and also the “Guitar” (Guitarra) magazine, with the purpose of promoting the Society’s activities. She was the professor of many Cuban guitarists including her son Isaac Nicola and her daughter Clara (Cuqui) Nicola.
After studying with his mother, Clara Romero, at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, Isaac Nicola (1916–1997) continued his training in Paris with Emilio Pujol, a disciple of Francisco Tárrega. He also studied the vihuela with Pujol and researched about the guitar’s history and literature.
After returning to Cuba, Nicola engages on a period of performing activity which concludes in 1957, with a concert where he premiered the famous Danza Característica by Leo Brouwer. From now on, he devotes himself entirely to teaching, assisted by other dedicated collaborators, such as professors Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola (his own sister) and Marianela Bonet.
Nicola proceeded to restructure his mother’s method and also added much of his own. He established the basis for a comprehensive guitar didactical system that, including the contribution of many others, was going to be applied to the academic formation of several generations of Cuban guitarists.
Two other important Cuban guitarists from that period of time were: José Rey de La Torre (1917–1944) and Juan Antonio Mercadal (1925–1998). Both of them traveled extensively as guitar performers and established themselves in the US. Rey de la Torre settled in California, while Mercadal became a resident of Miami, Florida, where he founded the Guitar School at the University of Miami.
The modern Cuban Guitar School.
After the Cuban revolution in 1959, Isaac Nicola and other professors such as Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola, Marianela Bonet and Leopoldina Núñez were integrated to the national music schools system, where a unified didactical method was implemented. This was a nucleus for the later development of a national Cuban Guitar School with which a new generation of guitarists and composers collaborated.
Maybe the most important contribution to the modern Cuban guitar technique and repertoire comes from Leo Brouwer (b. 1939). The grandson of Ernestina Lecuona, sister of Ernesto Lecuona, Brouwer began studying the guitar with his father and after some time continued with Isaac Nicola. He taught himself harmony, counterpoint, musical forms and orchestration before completing his studies at Juilliard School and Hartfod University.
According to renowned Venezuelan guitarist Alirio Díaz, “Brouwer is an important part of this process, of the creation of today’s music, for which he has opened new ways and introduced the avant-garde in the guitar and repertoire.” 
Other guitarists that collaborated with the foundation of the modern Cuban Guitar School are: Jesús Ortega (b. 1935) and Idelfonso Acosta (b. 1939).
Leo Brouwer has defined the modern Cuban Guitar School as follows: “The Cuban Guitar School is the sum of technical elements, a repertoire and a sensibility from the guitarists and creators toward this instrument, the guitar.” 
The new generations.
Since the 1960s, several generations of guitar performers, professors and composers have been formed under the Cuban Guitar School at educational institutions such as the Havana Municipal Conservatory, the Escuela Nacional de Artes (National Art Schools (Cuba)), and the Instituto Superior de Arte. Other guitarists, such as Manuel Barrueco, a concertist of international renown, developed their careers outside the country. Among many artists related to the Cuban Guitar School, we can mention the following names: Carlos Molina (guitarist), Sergio Vitier, Efraín Amador Piñero and Flores Chaviano, as well as: Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Martín Pedreira, Lester Carrodeguas, Mario Daly, José Angel Pérez Puentes and Teresa Madiedo. A younger group may include guitarists: Rey Guerra, Aldo Rodríguez Delgado, Pedro Cañas, Leyda Lombard, Marco Tamayo, Ernesto Tamayo, Rene Izquierdo, Miguel Bonachea, Joaquín Clerch and Yalil Guerra.
Compositions for guitar.
Numerous Cuban composers, many of them guitarists themselves, have contributed to create a body of work that may support the didactic and aesthetic efforts of the Cuban Guitar School. Before 1959, some composers such as Amadeo Roldán, José Ardévol, Joaquín Nin Culmell, Natalio Galán and Harold Gramatges began composing music for the classical guitar.
Apart from Leo Brouwer, that may be considered the most important Cuban composer for the guitar during the 20th and the 21st century, other composers have also written original compositions, didactical music and transcriptions for the instrument. A list of composers may include:Carlos Fariñas, Jesús Ortega, Nilo Rodríguez, Flores Chaviano, Efraín Amador Piñero, Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, José Angel Pérez Puentes, Martín Pedreira, Julio Roloff and Yalil Guerra.

Benson Mines

Star Lake, New York, a village in the southern St. Lawrence County, is geographically isolated at 60 miles from the nearest city. In the 1950s, the town became home to the largest open pit iron-ore mine in the world. The ore body at Benson Mine was discovered in 1810 by engineers conducting a survey for a new highway from Albany to Ogdensburg. The mine is actually located in the Town of Clifton, just east of the CDP limits of Star Lake.
History.
The engineers noticed the spinning of their compass needles due to the large quantities of magnetic ore under their feet. In 1889, the Magnetic Iron Company began developing the Star Lake ore body, which sat under some three-thousand acres of land. Production of ore halted in 1893 with a depression in the iron ore industry, but resumed in 1900. In 1910, the Benson Mines Company bought the site from the Magnetic Iron Company and continued operations on and off until 1918. At the onset of World War II, Benson Mines reopened when Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation leased the site. The U.S Department of Defense built ore processing facilities and the iron-ore was shipped to Pittsburgh for use in the war effort. The mining operation expanded significantly in the 1950s, and was renamed the New York Ore Division, although control remained in the hands of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation. At its height, the company employed 840 workers in 1960.
With the economic prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s the Company took a leading role in community development. The company published a magazine called Men and Steel, which provided “general information about different parts of the plant… *as well as+…personal interest stories, *and+ weddings births, deaths, anniversaries, and other family news…” In 1952, the magazine highlighted the Company’s financial contributions to town projects, which included construction of the Central School building, water system, housing project, and hospital.
Mining.
The ore body at Benson Mine is composed of magnetite and non-magnetite ore. The average percentage of iron in both magnetite and non-magnetite ore was about 23%., less than the 40% at Chateauguay. Iron-ore deposits that contained 50% or more iron were depleted in the United States by the mid-1940s. The ability to concentrate “non-magnetite ores by gravity processes” at Benson mines ensured its economic expansion because these processes enabled lower grade iron ore to be used in steel -making. In 1952, a gravity plant was built, which allowed non-magnetic ore to be processed on site. Ore was extracted using open pit mining methods. Holes were bored in the ground and filled with explosives. “About two gross tons of crude ore… *were produced+ per pound of explosive used.” A four ton ball on a crane smashed the ore into smaller pieces, which were then loaded onto a dump truck and transported to the Coarse Crushing Plant, which broke the ore into pieces three-inches in diameter. A conveyor belt then took the ore to the Fine Crushing Plant, which reduced it in size to “one and one-half inch in diameter.” The ore was sometimes crushed into even smaller pieces of “five eights of an inch” before it was sintered, concentrated, and transported to steel manufacturing centers. Sintering merges ore with coke so it is easier to process in steel facilities. 
On average, the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation shipped about 1 million tons of iron ore sinter each year to steel plants in Pittsburgh and Aliquippa, PA, and Cleveland, OH using the New York Central Railroad. Trains left from the Watertown Junction, traveled to the Benson Mine to pick up ore, returned to Watertown, and then continued on to Syracuse, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Ohio. The iron from Benson Mines was used in the steel production for Chrysler cars.
The process of open pit mining, which eliminated the need for costly underground mining, and “the relative softness of the rock, which simplified crushing and extraction…” served to the mine’s advantage; however, the “low iron-content of the ore…*and+…the remoteness of the mine from navigable water, necessitating relatively costly rail transportation” eventually hampered the mine’s financial success. Also, increasing pressure from foreign competitors, which were selling duty-free iron-ore products to the United States, caused the entire U.S steel industry to decline and collapse throughout the 1960s.
Closing of Mine.
The Benson Mine was a staple of the local economy. It employed hundreds of workers and supported over 1,900 people near the end of its operations. The mine also paid over 400,000 dollars each year in taxes, which helped to maintain local infrastructure and services. When the Benson Mine closed in August 1978 more than 365 people lost their jobs, and Star Lake slipped sharply into economic decline. The number of students enrolled in local schools dropped from 1,400 in 1978 to 625 the following year.

Mamiya C

The Mamiya C series is a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras manufactured by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm as well as a leaf shutter. A flash sync terminal is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.
Models.
While the basic shape remained the same, the bodies increased with size over time. The C22 and C220 models were aimed at amateurs and had less features, but were also lighter than the C33 and C330 models. Two models were made with Mamiyaflex on the nameplate attached to the viewfinder.
Lenses.
Lenses for the Mamiya C series have been grouped by users into three different series based on the appearance and model of the shutter: first chrome, second chrome, and black. Most lenses can be used on most bodies, but some combinations won't allow for automatic shutter cocking. The first chrome series had Seikosha-MX shutters with speeds from 1 s to 1/400 s. The second chrome series had Seikosha-S shutters with speeds from 1 s to 1/500 s, plus Bulb. A few chrome shutter lens had a Seikosha-SLV shutter. The black series had Seiko shutters, except for the 80 mm lens which had a Copal shutter.
Accessories.
The Mamiya C series were marketed as system cameras, and over time a wide array of accessories were offered. Not all accessories are fully compatible with all camera bodies.

Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski

Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski (, ; 5 February 1859, Nakhchivan – 1929, Shusha) was a Russian Imperial officer and later an Azerbaijani statesman. He was the brother of General-Adjutant Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski and father of Major General Jamshid Nakhchivanski.
Early life and military career.
Jafargulu Khan was born into a princely family, descending from the rulers of the Nakhchivan Khanate. His father was a Major General of the Russian Imperial army and his mother was the daughter of the khan of Maku. In 1867, young Jafargulu was signed up for the Page Corps. Upon graduating in 1877, he was promoted to cornet in the Her Majesty's Uhlan Life Guard Regiment based in Peterhoff. In April 1878, he was sent to a regiment stationed in the Caucasus and participated in the Russian occupation of Erzurum during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). In the later years, he participated in Central Asian campaigns of the Russian army, after which he was promoted to Staff captain. For his participation in these military operations, he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus (third degree, 1880), Order of Saint Vladimir (fourth degree, 1881) and Order of Saint Anne (third degree, 1882), as well as medals in conmemoration of the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 and for the siege of Geok Tepe.
In 1885 he was elevated to captain of cavalry and retired. In 1903, he was appointed mayor of Nakhchivan. From 1912 to 1917, he was honorary magistrate of Erivan.
Political activity.
Following the disintegration of the Russian Empire, Azerbaijan and Armenia, now both independent, quarrelled over the region of Nakhchivan. When in December 1918 it became clear that the British Chief Commissioner Sir John Oliver Wardrop's peace plan would assign Nakhchivan to Armenia instead of Azerbaijan, Nakhchivanski initiated an Azeri revolt, leading to the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Aras, composed of the former uyezds of Nakhchivan, Sharur-Daralagez and Surmali, with its capital in the city of Nakhchivan. Nakhchivanski became the head of the new republic, which in essence was de facto controlled by Azerbaijan. In May 1919, in the midst of the Armenian–Azerbaijani War, Armenia advanced its troops into it and managed to capture the city of Nakhchivan by June 1919. There it clashed with regular Azerbaijani troops, which reinstalled Azerbaijan's control over the city within a month. On 10 August 1919, the Armenians were forced to sign a peace treaty.
In summer 1920, in the aftermath of the Soviet annexation of Azerbaijan, the Armenians of Nakhchivan revolted. The Soviet Army entered Nakhchivan and quickly suppressed another the revolt. Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski was arrested by the Bolsheviks allegedly for "spreading anti-Soviet propaganda". He was incarcerated in Baku and claimed innocence in the petitions he sent to the Temporary Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan. His appeal was discarded; he was found guilty and transferred to a prison in Shusha, where he died in 1929.

Hermano Pablo

Paul Edwin Finkenbinder, known as Hermano Pablo (September 24, 1921 - January 27, 2012) was an American Christian evangelist who was involved in radio and television evangelical broadcasting in Latin America. He created and for many years ran the program ""Un mensaje a la conciencia"" ("A Message to the Conscience"). He and his wife Linda traveled extensively across Latin America conducting seminars, conferences and evangelistic crusades.
Early years.
Finkenbinder was the son of Frank and Aura Finkenbinder, both missionaries, and was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He grew up speaking both English and Spanish. He studied at Zion Bible Institute in East Providence, Rhode Island and at Central Bible College in Springfield, Missouri. He married his wife Linda in 1942, and was ordained by the Assemblies of God in 1947.
El Salvador.
After a short time in New Mexico, Finkenbinder and his wife moved to El Salvador in 1942. He began a radio ministry, Latin American Radio Evangelism, in 1955, and in 1960 added a television program, which reportedly had 100,000 weekly viewers in El Salvador.
California.
After 21 years of living and evangelizing in El Salvador, Finkenbinder and his family relocated to Costa Mesa, California, where they established the ministry headquarters in 1964. He would remain in California for the duration of his life, although he continued to travel extensively throughout Latin America in support of crusades and special evangelistic events. After a dispute relating to interdenominational organizations, he withdrew from the Assemblies of God in 1972, but returned to the denomination in 1988.
He received an honorary doctorate from Southern California College in Costa Mesa (now Vanguard University of Southern California) in 1993. 
In 1997 the program was reported to air "on more than 2,000 radio stations and in more than 27 countries". Around that time, Finkenbinder decided to retire from the ministry, which was taken over by Charles Ray Stewart and his wife, also named Linda. The ministry states that all the airtime on both radio and television are donated, and estimates that the current value of radio and TV airtime donated has been as high as $64 million.
Death.
On January 25, 2012, Finkenbinder and his wife celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. Later in the evening, however, he complained of a severe headache, and he was taken to the hospital where he slipped into a coma. He died in the morning hours of January 27, 2012.

Trois grandes études

Trois grandes études (Three Grand Études), Op. 76, is a set of three piano études composed by Charles-Valentin Alkan in 1838 and published in 1839. Although they have the highest opus number of any Alkan work, the etudes were actually composed when he was only 25. Featuring some of his most difficult writing, the first two études are for left hand only and right hand only, respectively. The third requires both hands to play in unison two octaves apart.
"Fantaisie" in A-flat major.
The first étude, "Fantaisie" in A-flat major, is for the left hand only. It features tremolos, numerous dense sequences of chords, and large jumps.
The first known performance was by Ferrucio Busoni in Berlin in 1908. A typical performance lasts 9 minutes.
"Introduction, Variations et Finale".
The second étude, Introduction, Variations et Finale, is for the right hand only. The longest and most difficult of the three, it features rapid cadenza-like flourishes along with many of the same technical challenges found in the first étude.
The first public performance is not known. A typical performance lasts 15–25 minutes.
"Mouvement semblable et perpetuel".
The third and final étude, Mouvement semblable et perpetuel, for both hands together, is quite different from the previous two études. It consists of a continuous stream of sixteenth notes duplicated two octaves apart.
A typical performance lasts 5 minutes.
Recordings.
Recordings of the "Trois grandes études" have been made by Stephanie McCallum (1985), Ronald Smith (1987), Laurent Martin (1993), Marc-André Hamelin (1994), Albert Frantz (2012), and Alessandro Deljavan (2013). The third etude was also recorded by Bogdan Czapiewski in 1983 and Vincenzo Maltempo in 2012.

Wizard101

Wizard101 is an MMORPG created by KingsIsle Entertainment. Players take on the role of students of Wizardry to save the Spiral, the fictional universe in which the game is played, and battle a variety of creatures by casting spells using a turn-based combat system similar to collectible card games.
The game also has a sister game called "Pirate101".
Development.
The fictional universe of the Spiral is divided into several worlds, each of which has multiple areas. Upon character creation, only some areas of Wizard City are opened to access. As the player progresses, more worlds become available that they can quest in, until they reach the max level of 100. Each of these worlds have their own templates and story-lines. They are listed in order of the player's access. They are first granted access to Wizard City, Krokotopia, Marleybone, MooShu, Dragonspyre, Celestia, Zafaria, Avalon, Azteca, and Khrysalis. There are also optional side worlds of Grizzleheim/Wintertusk, Wysteria, and Aquila which can be accessed at predetermined levels by players, 20 for Grizzleheim, 40 for Wintertusk, 25 for Wysteria, and 30 for Aquila. Players advance in the game by crowns, or by purchasing memberships that grant unlimited access to all areas for a limited time.
There are also pets that can cast spells to help the wizard in battle. You can train these pets at the pet pavilion in Wizard City completing quests.
The game holds a rating of "Everyone 10+ (E10+)" from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board for crude humor and mild fantasy violence. Although its target audience is 8 to 16-year olds, the game appeals to all ages.
Storylines.
Malistaire Drake Arc.
The main storyline revolves around the player's character, a novice wizard, joining the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts (it is hinted that the character is from Earth when it is stated by Ambrose that they are "from a world that does not even believe in magic"). Upon arrival, before even beginning with his or her enrollment, the new wizard comes face to face with the main antagonist in the game, the previous Death teacher, Malistaire Drake. The player then finds that he has been causing havoc in Wizard City, haunting the streets with undead creatures.
Malistaire Drake, while the player attempts to defeat the creatures, has moved on to attempt to steal the Krokonomicon, a powerful source of necromancy, so that he might make his wife, Sylvia Drake, rise again. The Krokonomicon has been taken along with the sarcophagus it was in from Krokotopia to the world of Marleybone for research purposes by the Marleybonians, and the player character follows Malistaire to Marleybone, chasing down Meowiarty in the process.
Upon arrival of the great city the player has to go to track down the sarcophagus. But the player has to wait until the mayor approves. He doesn't approve because the cities streets are unsafe due to a recent gang uprising. The player finally catches up with Malistaire in Big Ben Clocktower but it is too late.
Malistaire has fled the world with the Krokonomicon and heads to the next world, Mooshu. You go directly to the emperor to gain the Dragonspyre key, but Malistaire has been there and retrieved it and has caused the emperor to become very ill. The player must go around the world to gather ingredients to heal him and defeat the evil demons, The War Oni, Plague Oni, Death Oni, and Jade Oni.
After he is healed he gives the player a key to go to Dragonspyre. On arrival, Dragonspyre has been laid to ruins. The Dragon Titan (the large dragon on top of the Great Spyre) had destroyed the world in fire and chaos. After completing the Atheneum, Necropolis, and Dragonspyre Academy sub-zones the player confronts Malistaire for the final time on top of the Great Spyre. He unsuccessfully attempts to command the Dragon Titan to raise his wife, Sylvia, from the dead. The player goes into combat and defeats him once and for all. Malistaire is killed and becomes a ghost. His wife welcomes him to the spirit world and they vanish into the afterlife.
Morganthe Arc.
After defeating Malistaire, a new antagonist is discovered. Before the player meets the new antagonist, they travel to the sunken world of Celestia. Celestia was sunken by the storm titan because he was furious with the war between Morganthe's forces, known as the Morgantine Army, against the ancient Celestians. After the players explore the dungeons of the Stellarium, Lunarium, and Solarium, and explore the areas of Celestia they find Morganthe, the Umbra Queen, in the Solarium. She tells the player, "The Mirror will break, The Horn will call, From the shadows I strike, The skies will fall," and she flees the world with the secrets of Astral Magic.
The player discovers that she has traveled to the world of Zafaria, in search for her Deck of Shadows. After overcoming the forces of the Shadow Queen from the Lion tribes of the Savannah, the city of the Zebra warriors in Zamunda, and the Elephant cities of Waterfront and Stone Town and finding the missing students, the player discovers she has traveled to Mirror Lake with the relics that the Forces of Light gave to the Lions, Zebras, Elephants, and Gorillas. She destroys Mirror Lake after recovering her spell deck.
The player then travels to the world of Avalon, the home world of Merle Ambrose, his pet owl Gamma, and Morganthe in search for the Sword of Kings, the legendary blade of Avalon once held by King Artorius. After the player travels the expansive world of Avalon, through the large forest of the Weirwood, the castle's village of Caer Lyon, the grounds of Castle Avalon, Lake Nimue, and the castle Catacombs, they face Morganthe in this world - as a young woman - in Ghost Avalon. After the player battles her, they travel to Castle Avalon to retrieve the Sword of Kings to slay the Pendragon and restore the land. Once the player discovers the Pendragon is the once-thought late King Artorius cursed by the Horned Crown that Morganthe tricked him into wearing (the crown isn't part of the prophecy), they give King Artorius a potion and the land is restored.
After Avalon, players rediscover the lost world of Azteca. This is the oldest world in the Spiral, believed to be destroyed by the comet Xibalba ten years ago. When the player reaches Azteca, they soon learn the land is in trouble, with a recent rising of the undead similar to what Malistaire did in Wizard City, Krokotopia, Marleybone, Mooshu, and Dragonspyre. In addition, Morganthe appears to be in control of the dread comet Xibalba, threatening to destroy the ancient world. She has risen Malistare from the dead for a terribly important cause. After reaching the final pyramid, the Pyramid of the Falling Star, the players find Morganthe and her Dark Servant with Huracan Vicious sky (The Huracan Horn, the real horn in the prophecy). After he calls a portal to Xibalba, the players pursue Morganthe - however, it's too late. It is revealed that she already completed the ritual to send Xibalba into Azteca, while the players were helping the citizens of Azteca, and it can't be redirected. She sends her Servant (later to be revealed as Malistaire the Undying) to defeat the players once and for all. The players defeat Malistaire the Undying who is then hurled into the Spiral. The players inform Merle Ambrose on what Morganthe has done. She heads to Khrysalis (the home world of the Shadow Web), to learn the Song of Creation from the nine Lords of Night so that she can rewrite the Spiral to her own vision.
After players tell Merle about their journey and failure to save Azteca from Xibalba and Morganthe, he asks to gather the Council of Light and sends players to free the Lords of Night from Morganthe's clutches by entering Khrysalis in the last hope to stop Morganthe once and for all. Upon arrival in Khrysalis, Zaltanna the Mirrormask immediately spots you, demanding that players prove themselves before entering. Players must defeat two bosses solo in order to proceed through the Penumbra Barrier. After they get through, players find a Burrower by the name of Dyvim Whitehart. After saving him from Roze the Mousehunter, he tells players about Bastion and how Morganthe cast a spell on it in the final days of the Siege of Bastion to cast any living thing into crystal. He then tells players he will aid them to get to the Last Wood, but first they must get through the Moon Cliffs. The Moon Cliffs were once the spiritual center of the Burrowers in the Old Times, but now is one of the most dangerous places in Khrysalis since Morganthe corrupted the Eclipse Tower (which was once home to pure Moon Magic) with Shadow Magic. After going through the Moon Cliffs, players reach the Last Wood, the home of the Burrowers since the Fall of Bastion. After you help as much as you can, players head to Tyrian Gorge. Then, after causing trouble to distract the Umbra Legion from their tasks, you head back to Last Wood. Then many quests later after restoring Bastion to its ancient glory – restoring the Eclipse Tower, restoring balance between the Burrowers and the Bees, learning Shadow Magic, and a few more surprises – players travel to Fort Rachias, the final area of Khrysalis Part 1 to get a Dying Star Shard to help them cross the Starfall Sea to Morganthe's Shadow Palace. Fort Rachias is controlled by Ghost Dog, one of Morganthe's Elite Warlords. After defeating Ghost Dog, players retrieve the Star Shard and report to Zaltanna the Mirrormask. Soon after the events that happened in Khrysalis Part 1 (Bastion to Fort Rachias), you arrive at Crescent Beach. Though Fort Rachias has fallen due to Ghost Dog being defeated, Morganthe's Umbra Legion still has a tight grip on Crescent Beach. Attempting to look for someone to sail you across the Starfall Sea to the other side, you find someone named Taylor Coleridge. He sailed Morganthe across the sea when she first came to the world and before the sea was dangerous. After the sail across the Starfall Sea, you arrive at the Ruined Alcazar which was once known as the Radiant Alcazar or the Alcazar of Radiant Judgement. After visiting the past (Radiance Reborn) experiencing what the Alcazar once looked like and exploring Morganthe's Memories and Dreams, you head to the Mantis City of Sardonyx. After your deeds in Sardonyx, you go to the Kondha Desert in search for the Solar Arc. In the Solar Arc, you come across new Shadow Magic known as Shadow Creatures. After the Kondha Desert comes The Hive. The Hive is the main home for the Arachna and the Umbra Legion. Defeating several bosses, you finally come to Morganthe's Shadow Palace. After defeating the Roots of Morganthe's Tree of Creation, you arrive at the Galleries. After defeating Morganthe's warlords and freeing the Lords of Night, you arrive in Morganthe's Chamber. Once you confront Morganthe, she threatens you and turns into a gigantic Shadow Spider and forces you to fight her 4 forms each having symbols of a different school (Sun, Moon, Star, and Shadow). After the final confrontation of Light and Shadow, Morganthe threatens to strike the player with all her power, though in the process backfires with backlash instead of an attack and shatters the glass she is standing on. Morganthe ends up falling into the Spiral and is believed to have been defeated once and for all.
You then report to Zaltanna the Mirrormask in Bastion. Then you find an NPC known as Old Cob standing in Khrysalis. He then announces he will send war to Polaris, Empyrea, and Mirage. He then tells the player to say hello to Merle and Bartleby for him and says he will now write a new prophecy due to Morganthe's Prophecy being foretold. The Player returns to Merle in Wizard City and tells him about the battle between the player and Morganthe. He then seems upset that she is gone due to her being his first student in Avalon and Ravenwood. He then says that Old Cob could be trouble though we would have to wait what tomorrow brings.
Known worlds.
Mentioned/Possible Worlds.
Some of these worlds have been mentioned or exist in Wizard101's sister game Pirate101. Most of these worlds are mentioned in Wizard101, however not guaranteed to be true and most are just rumors:
Payment model.
The game offers a choice of either subscription or "Free-to-Play" with microtransactions. Free-to-Play customers can purchase access to different areas of content using in-game currency called "Crowns". Such areas only need to be purchased once, but other actions in the game may be necessary before accessing them. Crowns also can be used to buy in game exclusive items and access PvP tournaments. The fee for PvP tournaments vary depends on whether the player has existing member subscription. Crowns can be purchased by a game card or from the online store.
If a player decides to begin a subscription, they are not only free to roam about all playable worlds during their timed subscription days but are also able to participate in ranked PvP matches, Ranked Pet Derby races, buying Castles and Lands (or after reaching Level 15), advanced Crafting, Gifting capabilities, True Friends, faster Energy regeneration, larger backpack, larger friends list and faster Crafting timers. Also outside of the game, players will gain the ability to post on the Wizard101 Message Board.
Also, certain areas and dungeons in Wizard101 can be rented for a certain period of time such as the 6-hour rentals for Mount Olympus, Atlantea, and Tartarus in Aquila. PvP and Pet Derby can be rented as well. A certain amount of crowns per match or a certain amount per day(24 Hours).
Game mechanisms.
Magic schools.
All enemies, spells, and most of the equipment are assigned a magic school, which determines many of their properties. Every wizard has a school of focus, chosen during character creation. A short personality quiz can be taken at character creation, which will suggest a school of focus, which players can accept or modify. The possible focus schools are the Elemental Schools (made up of Fire, Ice, and Storm), the Spirit Schools (made up of Life, Myth, and Death), and the Balance School. The three astral schools of Star, Moon, and Sun and the new Shadow Magic cannot be chosen as focus schools, but rather are learned as secondary schools. A wizard's focus school determines which spells he or she will learn, what equipment they can use, their base stats, and gives access to school-specific quests and pets. Each school has specific advantages and disadvantages, but the schools are (at least in theory) balanced overall: Storm focuses on damage (with the strongest spells in the game); Ice deals with defense; Fire works with damage-over-time attacks, which deal damage over three rounds of gameplay; Myth can summon many minions and can eliminate enemies' shields; Life's main goal is healing themselves and others; Death is for stealing health from enemies and using half the stolen energy to heal themselves; Balance supports the other six schools while leveling out the playing field. When players cooperate in fights, it is often advantageous to have representatives of different schools, but each school is fully capable of solo play. Every wizard also has the opportunity to learn spells outside the focus school, but must use a limited currency ("Training Points" gained every 4 levels until level 20, where it becomes every 5 levels) to buy these spells (in addition to Star, Moon, Sun and Shadow Magic spells) - this means that no single wizard can learn every spell. Along with the main schools of magic, astral and shadow magics have their own effects. Shadow is a school specially built for amazing effects to help your wizard through difficult times. Shadow Spells such as Shadow Shrike add effects such as Pierce and Damage, While Shadow Spells such as Shadow Seraph add a large heal boost. The Star school focuses on what are called by many wizards "auras". These increase the casters stats for 4 rounds or 5 rounds if the aura is cast as a pet may-cast. The Sun school focuses on enchants that boost the spells they are used on. They can increase damage dealt, increase accuracy, make blades/traps more effective, mutate cards into new spells, and increase healing ability. The Moon school is a school of magic that focuses on "polymorphing" into a different creature for 6 rounds. This changes gear, health, appearance, and even school of the caster.
Combat.
Combat pitches up to four players against up to four computer-controlled enemies or other players, using spells from their deck to defeat them. A victory awards the player with experience and various items, including equipment which primarily serves to increase combat statistics (e.g. damage, accuracy, health).
The combat sequence is turn-based. The player chooses a card from a deck they have assembled from the cards they have, and clicks on the target, damaging the opposing player or enemy, restoring their own health (or health of their allies), or strengthening or weakening allies or opponents. Some cards (or "spells") do more than one of these things, or something else entirely (e.g. summoning a computer-controlled minion to assist the player who summoned it).
Certain creatures or players(with certain weapons) can interrupt another player's/creature's turn by either a cheat, may-cast pet, or one of the Khrysalis may-cast wands making figuring your strategy out a little more complicated.
Wisps.
Wisps are floating orbs of light that fly around in an area. Red wisps restore some health and Blue Wisps restore some mana when you catch one. The amount of health or mana restored by each wisp differs on different wizards depends on the total health or mana of the particular wizard. Additional wisps cannot be caught once the player is full of health and mana. Red wisps are only found in monster-infested areas of the worlds, while blue wisps are more commonly found in the safe areas of the world, but can be seen in other locations. If a player is in a safe area, their health regenerates slowly over time.
Player housing.
KingsIsle released a player housing feature named "Castles/Houses" on May 6, 2009, enabling players to edit and customize their own virtual space. Some houses can be bought in various locations around the game, often for gold, but sometimes for crowns, while others can be gained from Gift Cards. Housing tour feature had been introduced, enabling players to visit and rate houses that had been inserted in tour list.
Another addition to the housing world of Wizard101 is the ability to build their own castles, players are given a plot of land (currently only the Midday Estate, Meadows at Dusk and the Night Garden) where they are able to place blocks to create their own houses. Currently the only way to obtain these Plots of Land and Building Blocks is through the Arcane Builders Bundle. 
Player interaction.
Due to its young core audience, Wizard101 restricts player interaction when compared to other games in the massively multiplayer online genre. There are three different types of chat: Menu Chat, Open Chat and Text Chat. In Text Chat, what a player types can be seen by every other wizard in the area either from a word bubble on top of the speakers head or in the chat box. Private Chat is when a wizard wishes to speak in private to another wizard. This appears on the screen in a transparent box to the left. The age of the player directly correlates to the communication allowable. When typed, words that appear in white are words that everyone is able to view. Yellow words can only be seen by players who have their account set to "Open Chat". Open chat is obtained when a player has a credit card and they are 18 years or older. Red words are not allowed and can be seen by no one, not even the player themselves. If an adult chatter types yellow words, young wizards will see ellipses (...) in place of the word.
Aside from the different levels of chat filters available depending on player age, duels between players are available only in a special player versus player arena designated for the purpose. The PvP arena can be found upon entry to Unicorn Way from the Commons in Wizard City. The PVP arenas are also found in SOME crowns houses and all of the Bundle houses. (This is your private arena, and can only be used when you and other players are in your home.)
Rewards for combat or completing a quest are distributed automatically among the party, so players need not fight for spoils. Players may trade a special type of spell card called a treasure card, which is a spell card that can be rearranged by clicking the golden card icon in their spellbook and then can be used in battle when the player discards cards and then clicks draw. These cards can only be used once, and can be used by any school of Magic. This spell will disappear from the player's treasure deck once it is used. So far the players are currently unable to trade items between one another (it is possible, however, to trade items to one's other wizards on the same account, through the use of a shared bank).
Online safety features.
Several features have been implemented to protect younger players in the online world. Parents must activate controls for players under 13, including setting levels for interaction with other players in the world. Three different levels of chat are available. At the most restricted level, players select from a menu of pre-defined phrases, and players using this option can only see menu chat from other players. At the next level, players may type what they want, as long as the words are available in the game’s dictionary. If a word is not present in the dictionary, or part of a forbidden phrase, such as asking another player’s age, it will not be visible. If players know each other outside the game, they can use a true friend code to allow less-restricted chat inside the game. However, it is still subject to some restrictions. Additionally, players choose names for their characters from a list that allows selection of a first name and a one- or two-part surname. You can also choose to not have a surname, and just have a first name. Names for in-game pets can also be selected from a list, though pets dropped from creatures or given as quest rewards are given randomly-generated names. Players must pay gold to change their names. The official game forums are filtered and moderated. Finally, at player request, KingIsle Entertainment added open chat for players aged 18 years and above, an age limit verified through credit cards, which allows everything except profanities to be said.
Other features have been designed with a pre-teens audience in mind, for example opponents in combat disintegrate or vanish, and there is no blood.
Development history.
According to a press release published in May 2008, the development of Wizard101 began in 2005, upon the founding of KingsIsle Entertainment under the creative direction of J. Todd Coleman. The game entered open beta on August 6, 2008, and it launched successfully on September 2, 2008. On August 25, 2010, it was announced that Wizard101 would be released in foreign territories later that year.
Wizard101 launched a European Beta version on December 15, 2010 and then released the game on February 15, 2011, in partnership with Gameforge. This eventually included releases of the game in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish, Greek and Turkish.
It was announced on August 17, 2011 that KingsIsle and Taomee Holdings Limited had an agreement to launch Wizard101 in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. This has been the company's biggest move since launching the game in Europe. Wizard101 Taiwan officially launched on April 27, 2012, with the others to follow.
Reception.
According to KingIsle Entertainment's press releases, the game has experienced a steady growth in the number of players: 2 million in April 2009, 5 million in September 2009, ten million players by June 2010, 15 million by January 2011, 20 million by July 2011, and 30 million by July 2013. In terms of reception, the game currently scores an average of 77.5% from ratings on GameRankings. GameShark reviewer Toni Dimayuga noted the game's overall ambiance and graphic setting as well as the overall fun nature of Wizard101 in the pro column, while the combat (in particular defeats) and the restrictive (at the time of the review) nature of chat were seen as the major minus points.

Škrilj, Kočevje

Škrilj (; in older sources also "Dolenje Zdihovo", ) is a village in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. It no longer has any permanent residents.
History.
Škrilj was a Gottschee German village. The village was laid waste in an Ottoman raid in 1491. In 1942 the village was the site of a civilian refugee camp for people that had fled into the forests from Italian occupation forces. During the Second World War three houses in the village were destroyed in aerial bombardment, but the remaining 13 survived. The village was gradually abandoned after the war; in 1953 four houses were still inhabited.
Church.
The church in the village was a chapel of ease dedicated to the Holy Cross and it dated from the beginning of the 17th century. The church stood at the top of a hill at the western edge of the village. It had a short rectangular nave and a narrow polygonal chancel walled on three sides. It was probably built in the first half of the 17th century. According to Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, the main altar was dedicated to the Holy Cross and the side altars to the Virgin Mary and Saint Margaret. After 1840 it became a vicariate to Zdihovo. The belfry was probably added at this time and a bell cast in 1844 was installed. The church still stood in 1950, but like many other churches in the region it was destroyed between 1953 and 1954. The church was also surrounded by a cemetery. Today only the threshold of the church and the remnants of a few gravestones remain.

Bunshinsaba (2012 film)

Bunshinsaba (Chinese title: 筆仙) is a 2012 Chinese horror film directed by Ahn Byeong-ki." The film has the same title as Ahn Byeong-ki 2004 film "Bunshinsaba", but contains an unrelated plot. The film is set in Beijing, where Xiao Ai (Mei Ting) has her horror novel rejected by her patient publisherfinds out her ex-husband, Qi Kun (Wu Chao), has been released from prison and is looking for Xiao Ai and her asthmatic son Xiao Xin (Zhu Jiangdi). Xiao Ai and Xiao Xin are offered an old house by her doctor where unexplainable events begin to happen.
Style.
Derek Elley of Film Business Asia commented that outside the fact that the characters were speaking Mandarin, that the film "looks exactly like a South Korean one — from its clean-looking shooting style, photography, editing, music and even immaculate wardrobe — and with its remote setting could just as well have been shot in South Korea as well." The Chinese title of the film translates to a type of ouija board game using a pen, but no such item appears in the film.
Release.
"Bunshinsaba" was released in China on July 12, 2012. The film grossed RMB32.0 million (US$5.01 million) in the first seven days of its theatrical run. Since the film's release, director Ahn Byeong-ki has become the first South Korean director to set up his own workshop (ByungKi An China Studio) in Mainland China. The film ended its theatrical run grossing RMB61 million (US$9.93 million). The film was followed up with a sequel "Bunshinsaba 2" in 2013.

National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union

The was a Japanese trade union, which was usually referred to as in Japanese. It merged with Tetsuro and other right wing unions to form JR-Soren (Japan Confederation of Railway Workers' Unions--JRU) now affiliated to RENGO (Japanese Trade Union Confederation).
History.
Founding.
Doro (National Railway Motive Power Union) split from the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro) in 1951. It was considered to be more left-leaning. Doro was a major union, along with Kokuro, representing workers who worked for Japanese National Railways (JNR).
Formation of Zendoro.
In 1974, the Doro national leadership expelled several branches in Hokkaido area that had not supported Doro's political campaign for the Socialist Party' National Parliament candidates. Expelled branches formed Zendoro (All Japan National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union).
Split with Doro-Chiba.
In 1979 the Chiba prefecture chapter of the union split off to form an independent union, which became known as Doro-Chiba. Doro-Chiba split off after its executive committee members had expelled by Doro national leadership because of their support to the struggle of farmers in Chiba Prefecture against the operation and expansion of Narita International Airport.
JNR privatization.
When privatization of JNR was proposed in the mid 1980s, JNR's unions including Doro were strongly opposed and campaigned against it. Doro, however, actively supported the privatization plan. JNR was privatized in 1987, and replaced by the Japan Railways Group (JR Group). As of 1985 Doro had 38,000 workers. 
Lists of workers to be employed by the new organizations were drawn up by JNR and given to the JR companies. There was substantial pressure on union members to leave their unions, and within a year, Kokuro's membership fell from 200,000 to 44,000. Workers who had supported the privatization, or those who left Kokuro, were hired at substantially higher rates than members of Kokuro, Zendoro and Doro-Chiba.
JNR dismissal lawsuit.
Dismissals.
There was a government pledge that no one would be "Thrown out onto the street", so unhired workers were classified as "needing to be employed" and were transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, where they could be assigned for up to three years.
Around 7,600 workers were transferred in this way, and around 2,000 of them were hired by JR firms, and 3,000 found work elsewhere. Mitomu Yamaguchi, a former JNR employee from Tosu in Saga prefecture who had been transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, later stated that their help in finding work consisted of giving him photocopies of recruitment ads from newspapers. 
This period ended in April 1990, and 1,047 were dismissed. This included 64 Zendoro members and 966 Kokuro members.
Settlement.
Many lawsuits and labor commission cases were filed over the decades from the privatization in 1987. 23 years after the original privatization, on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court settled the dispute between the workers and the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency, the successor body to the JNR Settlement Corporation. The agency said it would pay 20 billion yen, approximately 22 million yen per worker, to 904 plaintiffs. However, as the workers were not reinstated, it was not a full settlement.

Deeper Life Church shooting

On 7 August 2012, a mass shooting occurred at Deeper Life, an evangelical Christian church near Okene in Nigeria's central Kogi State. Three unidentified gunmen killed 19 people, including the church's pastor. The following day, in an apparent reprisal killing, three gunmen on motorcycles killed two soldiers and a civilian outside a mosque in Okene.
Background.
Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group whose goal is to institute sharia law throughout Nigeria, has become more active and more skilled in carrying out attacks since clashes with security forces in 2009. Since then, it has claimed responsibility, or been blamed for, numerous attacks on Nigerian government and civilian targets. Most attacks have been in the primarily Muslim north of Nigeria, though the group's name has been used to claim other bombings, such as the attacks against the United Nations headquarters and the main police building in the capital city of Abuja. The group itself has since splintered, with some members allied to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and some expecting terms of agreement similar to southern Nigeria's MEND.
Shootings.
Church shooting.
The attack took place on 7 August 2012, at the Deeper Life Bible Church in the town of Otite, which is on the outskirts of the city of Okene in Kogi State. Three men, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, entered the church as a Bible study session was about to begin. One of the men switched off the generator that provided lighting in the church. The other two men then fired into the darkness with their assault rifles. Fifteen people were killed outright and four more died later from their wounds.
No group claimed responsibility for the shooting. Although the Islamist group Boko Haram has attacked Christian churches before, the attack was further south than the group's usual area of operations.
Mosque shooting.
On 8 August, three gunmen on motorcycles shot dead two soldiers outside a mosque in Okene. A civilian was also killed by crossfire. The soldiers were on patrol outside the mosque and were fired upon at the end of a prayer session.
Reactions.
As the attacks occurred around Okene, on the border between Nigeria's mostly Christian south and mostly Muslim north, they were described as "worrying" for religious tensions in Nigeria. Security forces were deployed to the area and national police chief Mohammed Abubakar ordered 24-hour surveillance on all churches and mosques in Kogi State's central area. Nigerian soldiers and police officers searched for the gunmen through the night following the shooting.
Idris Wada, the Governor of Kogi State, announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of the state. He said, "The perpetrators of the heinous crime are wicked, devilish, ungodly and deserve no place in a sane society. But they will not get away with it this time. We will spare no resource at our disposal to fish out the perpetrators and smoke terrorism out of our state." Wada also visited the Ohinoyi of the Ebira people to express displeasure at the situation in his territory.
Investigation.
Residents of the Okene area alleged that in the days following the shooting, police had conducted house-to-house searches, beating a number of civilians. Some citizens were reported to have fled the city. A police spokesman denied any violence had taken place. Several former politicians from the Okene area were brought to Lokoja for questioning related to the attacks.
On 9 August, police announced that they had arrested two men and one woman suspected of perpetrating the church shooting. The three were reportedly arrested following a gunfight with police in Ibillo, Edo State.

<doc id="36662060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36662060" title="Cyclone Ofa">
Cyclone Ofa

Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa (JTWC designation: 13P, also known as Hurricane Ofa) was considered to be the worst cyclone to affect the Samoan islands since the 1889 Apia cyclone. The system was first noted on January 27 near Tuvalu, as a shallow tropical depression that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone. The cloud pattern slowly organized, and on January 31, while located east of Tuvalu,Ofa attained cyclone intensity. Moving slowly southeast, Ofa developed storm-force winds. It attained hurricane-force winds on February 2. Cyclone Ofa reached peak intensity on February 4. Shortly after, its peak Ofa began to weaken over a less favourable environment. Ofa was declared an extratropical cyclone on February 8, though the system was still tracked by meteorologists until February 10.
Ofa produced gales or high winds or gales on many islands, resulting in widespread damage due to a combination of storm surge and high seas. In all, eight people were killed and damage totaled to . The worst effects were recorded in Samoa, where seven people were killed. Roughly 200 people were evacuated, and 10 to 20 others were injured through the islands. Extreme damage to crops and trees was also recorded. Elsewhere, Ofa was blamed for the lowest ever recorded pressure on the island of Niue, along with considerable damage.
Meteorological history.
Towards the end of January 1989, a surge in the Northern Hemisphere's trade winds and the Southern Hemispheres monsoon, led to the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and the Australian monsoon trough becoming active after a prolonged period of dormancy. As a result two shallow tropical depressions were spawned; one over the Coral Sea that went on to become Cyclone Nancy, while the other was first noted within the SPCZ over Tuvalu on January 27. Over the next two days the system developed little and remained slow moving, near the Tuvaluan atoll of Funafuti. During January 30, the depression moved towards the north-east and started to organize, as pressures near the systems center rapidly falling. During the next day the system subsequently started to curve south-eastwards and away from Tuvalu, before the United States Naval Western Oceanography Center (NWOC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 13P during January 31. At 19:17 UTC on January 31, Fiji Meteorological Service's Nadi Tropical Cyclone Warning Center named the system Ofa, after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. As it was named the system was located about to the east of Tuvalu and had started to curve more towards the south-southeast. During February 1, as Ofa started to affect Western Samoa, the NWOC reported that Ofa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).
TCWC Nadi subsequently reported during the next day that the system had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. Ofa passed about to the west of the Western Samoan Island of Savai'i between 10:00 and 18:00 UTC during February 3. Early the next day as the system started to accelerate towards the south-southeast towards the island nation of Niue, the NWOC estimated that Ofa had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 215 km/h (130 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Later that day TCWC Nadi also estimated that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Early on February 5, Ofa started to show signs that it had started to weaken, as it passed about to the west of Niue. Over the next day the system slowly weakened as it moved southwards, before late on February 6, TCWC Nadi passed the primary warning responsibility for Ofa to the New Zealand Meteorological Service, after the system had moved below 25°S. The system subsequently weakened very quickly and started to transition into an extratropical cyclone, as it encountered strong upper level winds and cooler waters. The system completed this transition during February 8, before the remnants were last noted during February 10 after they had performed a small clockwise loop.
Preparations, impact and aftermath.
Cyclone Ofa affected seven different island nations and caused gales or much stronger winds in six of those countries which resulted in damage ranging from moderate to very severe. Storm tide from the cyclone which is the combined effect of storm surge and high tide caused havoc in several countries and was the major cause of destruction. Overall the system killed at least eight people while it was estimated that the overall damage would amount to over with damage totals of at least and in Western and American Samoa.
Tuvalu.
On January 30, TCWC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert as it was possible, that the system could produce gale force winds over the islands within 36 hours. A gale warning was subsequently issued for the islands of Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Niulakita and a strong wind warning for the rest of the archipelago. As the system developed over the islands during February 1, winds gradually increased, with strong to gale force winds experienced in the archipelago. The system subsequently had a major impact on the island nation, along with the Samoa depression that affected the islands a few days later. The majority of the islands reported damage to vegetation and crops, such as bananas, coconuts and breadfruits. Staff housing and a chapel on a government secondary school campus were up-roofed and collapsed, while a supermarket building collapsed as a result of heavy swells. On Vaitupu Island around 85% of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed, while residential homes were also destroyed on the islands of Niutao, Nui and Nukulaelae. On Funafuti sea waves flattened the Hurricane Bebe bank at the southern end of the airstrip, which caused sea flooding and prompted the evacuation of several families from their homes. In Nui and Niulakita there was a minor loss of the landscape because of sea flooding while there were no lives lost. After the systems had impacted Tuvalu, a Disaster Rehabilitation Sub-Committee was appointed to evaluate the damage caused and make recommendations to the National Disaster Committee and to the Cabinet on what should be done to help rehabilitate the affected areas. Emergency food aid and other humanitarian relief assistance was received from donors and the Red Cross. The total cost of reconstruction in the island nation was estimated, as exceeding .
Wallis and Futuna.
Early on February 2, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for Wallis Island, as Ofa was expected to pass close enough to the island to cause gale force winds on the island. Later that day the system passed about to the east of Wallis, and produced gale force winds on the island for a brief pierod. There were no casualties reported on the island, while sea flooding caused some minor damage to villages roads.
Tokelau.
During February 2, a gale warning was issued for the whole of Tokelau by TCWC Nadi, as Ofa started to affect the island with heavy rain, high seas and strong to gale force winds. Ofa caused extensive damage to the islands public buildings, after sea walls around the atolls of Nukunonu, Atafu and Fakaofo were washed away by high seas. Around 80% of the breadfruit and coconut trees were destroyed or damaged by the winds, while an inundation of water associated with Ofa was responsible for washing away or contaminating topsoil. The whole population of Swains Island was made homeless, after their homes suffered extensive damage. The island also suffered from a complete loss of agricultural crops including bananas, pawpaws, breadfruits and taro. No deaths or serious injuries were reported within the island nation. About a week after the system had affected Tokelau, the Royal New Zealand Air Force delivered urgently needed supplies via airdrop, before further assistance from New Zealand arrived by sea.
Western Samoa.
Cyclone Ofa affected Western Samoa between February 1-4, with heavy rain, huge waves, sea spray, storm surge and wind gusts exceeding . This created an impact on the island nation that had not been encountered in over 100 years, while the entire population was left in a state of shock. Ahead of Ofa affecting Western Samoa, TCWC Nadi issued various gale and storm force wind warnings for Samoa, however due to communication and various other problems some of these warnings did not reach the Apia Observatory. Some of the warnings that did get through were distorted and contained strong wind warnings, rather than storm force wind warnings. As a result it was not known what was broadcast to the public who were warned to expect strong winds rather than storm force winds and thus TCWC Nadi was left with no doubt, that the correct precautionary measures may not have been taken. 
During February 2, (February 1, Samoa Standard Time (SST)) the meteorological stations at the Apia Observatory and the Faleolo Airport started to report gale force winds. During that day rain became heavy and widespread, before as the winds picked up most communications with the island nation were lost. At the height of the storm the only means of communication with Western Samoa, was through a Polynesian Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft that was standing at Faleolo Airport. The Apia meteorological office was hit by high sea waves at 21:45 UTC (10:45 SST) and had to be abandoned due to rising floods before being completely destroyed a few hours later.
American Samoa.
Despite passing about to the west of Pago Pago, Cyclone Ofa affected American Samoa between February 3–5 with wind gusts of up to , which caused widespread and extensive damage to the territory. Ahead of the cyclone affecting the island nation, a gale warning was issued by TCWC Nadi for the American territory, while forecasting that very heavy rain, high seas and damaging sea swells would impact the area.
On February 4, within the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, the Lieutenant Governor Galea'i Peni Poumele placed the whole of American Samoa under a state of emergency. Upon his return from an international conference the Governor Peter Tali Coleman subsequently wrote to the United States President George H. W. Bush on February 7, asking him to declare the islands a federal disaster area and asked for money to help the American territory rebuild and recover from the Cyclone. The President subsequently declared the islands a major disaster area on December 9, which enabled Samoans to claim federal aid.
Tonga.
During February 2, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu islands, while issuing the rest of Tonga with tropical cyclone alerts and a strong wind warnings. During February 3, as the system moved towards Tonga, TCWC Nadi predicted that it would pass about to the east of Niuatoputapu, at about 1100 UTC February 4, (0000 , February 5). As a result TCWC Nadi issued a hurricane warning for Niuatoputapu and gale warnings for the rest of the Tonga. Ofa subsequently moved more towards the southeast than expected and passed about to the east of Niuatoputapu. As a result the Haapai and Tongatapu island groups did not receive any gale force winds from the system, while Niuatoputapu only experienced storm force winds from the system. Severe damage to houses, church buildings, coconut plantations, food crops and other vegetation, was reported on the islands of Tafahi and Niuatoputapu. Over 70% of the housing in Niuatoputapu was completely destroyed, while the roofs of the remaining 30% were partially or completely damaged. On Niuafo'ou a moderate amount of damage was reported, but was generally confined to crops and vegetation. One death was attributed to Ofa on Niuafo'ou, while overall the system caused about in damage to Tonga.
Niue.
Early on February 4, the island nation of Niue was placed under a gale warning, as gale force winds or stronger were forecast to occur over the island nation during the next day. A hurricane warning was subsequently issued later that day, after the system had accelerated towards the south-southeast and started to affect Niue. As winds on the island picked up the Telecommunications Center shut down its operations, while the satellite on the island was taken down. Radio New Zealand subsequently broadcast Special Weather Bulletins for Niue on air, after being requested to by TCWC Nadi and NZMS. The island was affected by hurricane force winds for several hours during February 5, as Ofa's eye passed about to west of the island. At around 03:00 UTC Niue recorded what was its lowest ever recorded pressure of . Very high seas which reportedly were several meters high, swept over the islands northern and western coasts, with virtually all of the landings to the sea washed away or badly damaged. Considerable damage was recorded to the islands hospital, hotel, roads, houses, churches and other facilities for public use. Due to the damage to the power lines, electricity was out for about 24 hours. Most of the islands private water supply tanks were contaminated by salt water and declared unsuitable for drinking. There were lives lost or significant injuries reported, while the total loss on the island from the cyclone was estimated at around . Within the aftermath of the cyclone the Royal New Zealand Air Force flights brought in emergency medical supplies, generators, water and fuel pumps, and food to Niue while a New Zealand navy vessel, the Endeavour, delivered additional foodstuffs, as well as building and plumbing materials, two weeks after the storm.

Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange designed around securely exchanging information which is a process made possible by certain principles of cryptography. The first cryptocurrency to be created was Bitcoin in 2009. Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies are specifications regarding the use of currency which seek to incorporate principles of cryptography to implement a distributed, decentralized and secure information economy.
Overview.
When comparing cryptocurrencies to fiat money, the most notable difference is in how no group or individual may accelerate, stunt or in any other way significantly abuse the production of money. Instead, only a fixed amount of cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is bounded by a value both prior defined and publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the Federal Reserve System, governments control the value of currency by printing units of fiat money or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. However, governments cannot produce units of cryptocurrency and as such, governments cannot provide backing for firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in a decentralized cryptocurrency. The underlying technical system upon which all cryptocurrencies are now based was created by the anonymous group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto for the purpose of creating an economy within which the practice of fractional reserve banking would be fundamentally impossible.
Hundreds of cryptocurrency specifications now exist; most are similar to and derived from the first fully implemented cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Similar protocols include Proof-of-stake, a common authentication protocol forked from the Proof-of-work authentication protocol used by Bitcoin. Within cryptocurrency systems the safety, integrity and balance of all ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners, who are usually members of the public, handling cryptocurrency transactions for a small fee. Miners use resource-intensive computer software to help secure a particular cryptocurrency's network by increasing that network's ability to solve mathematical equations which the network directly uses to impede fraud. Subverting the underlying security of a cryptocurrency is mathematically possible, but the cost may be unfeasibly high. For example, against Bitcoin's proof-of-work based system, an attacker would need computational power greater than that controlled by the entire community of miners in order to even have
of a chance, which means directly circumventing Bitcoin's security is now a task well beyond even a technology company the size of Google.
Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually introduce new units of currency, placing an ultimate cap on the total amount of currency that will ever be in circulation. This is done both to mimic the scarcity (and value) of precious metals and to avoid hyperinflation. Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies are less susceptible to seizure by law enforcement. Existing cryptocurrencies are all pseudo-anonymous, though additions such as Zerocoin and its distributed laundry feature have been suggested, which would allow for anonymity.
History.
The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. It also had a much faster transaction time compared to Bitcoin, making it more usable as a currency. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid. Many other cryptocurrencies have been created though few have been successful, as they have brought little in the way of technical innovation.
Publicity.
Central bank representatives have stated that the adoption of Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin pose a significant challenge to central banks' ability to influence the price of credit for the whole economy, they've also stated that as trade using Cryptocurrencies become more popular, there is bound to be a loss of consumer confidence in fiat currencies.
Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated "widespread use cryptocurrency would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy, He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy.
Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin launched the first Bitcoin ATM in the United States on February 20, 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.
The Dogecoin Foundation, a charitable organization centered around Dogecoin and co-founded by Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer, donated more than $30,000 worth of Dogecoin to help fund the Jamaican bobsled team's trip to the 2014 Olympic games in Sochi, Russia. The growing community around Dogecoin is looking to cement its charitable credentials by raising funds to sponsor service dogs for children with special needs.
Legality.
Cryptocurrencies are legal in all countries except Iceland, due primarily to Iceland's freeze on foreign exchange. Controversy over the misuse of cryptocurrency has also led to restrictions in certain countries – regulators in China banned the handling of Bitcoins by financial institutions during an extremely fast adoption period in early 2014. In Russia, though cryptocurrencies are perfectly legal, it is illegal to actually purchase goods with any currency other than the Russian ruble.
On March 25, 2014 the IRS ruled that Bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes as opposed to currency. This means Bitcoin will be subject to capital gains tax. One benefit of this ruling is that it clarifies the legality of Bitcoin. No longer do investors need to worry that investments in or profit made from Bitcoins are illegal or how to report them to the IRS.
Some cryptocurrency have legal issues such as Coinye, an altcoin that used, without permission, rapper Kanye West as its logo. This altcoin has been compared to the popular Dogecoin. Upon hearing of the release of Coinye, originally called Coinye West, attorneys for Kanye West sent a cease and desist letter to the email operator of Coinye, whose name remains unknown. The letter stated that Coinye was willful trademark infringement, unfair competition, cyberpiracy, and dilution and instructed Coinye to stop using the likeness and name of Kanye West.
Arrests.
There have been very few arrests in the United States related to Bitcoin. This is primarily due to the difficulty of tracking Bitcoin payments. The arrests that have been made are all on charges of using Bitcoin to launder money. The most notable case was the arrest of Charlie Shrem, the CEO of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange backed by the Winklevoss twins.
Florida has taken a firm stance against money laundering through Bitcoin with its recent arrest of three money launderers. The launderers were purportedly using the website localbitcoins.com to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in Bitcoin. They were apprehended after an undercover agent asked to purchase Bitcoin with the intent of buying stolen credit cards online.
Though not directly related to cryptocurrency, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013 for running an illegal drug trafficking website, The Silk Road, that used Bitcoin as the only payment option. Ross William Ulbricht was arrested on charges of alleged murder-for-hire and narcotics trafficking violation and identified him as the founder and chief operator "Dread Pirate Roberts." Bitcoins are the only currency accepted on the site, because they are traded electronically and are difficult to trace to individuals. But Bitcoin accounts also lack protections that most bank accounts have, including government-backed insurance.
Fraud.
On August 6, 2013 Magistrate Judge Amos Mazzant of the Eastern District of Texas federal court ruled that because cryptocurrency (expressly Bitcoin) can be exchanged for government issued currencies, cryptocurrency could be considered real currency. This ruling allowed for the SEC to have jurisdiction over cases of securities fraud involving cryptocurrency.
GBL, a Chinese Bitcoin trading platform suddenly shut down, and up to $5 million worth of Bitcoin disappeared with it. Subscribers were unable to log into the Chinese bitcoin platform on October 26, 2013 and as much as $5 million disappeared.
In February 2014 cryptocurrency made national headlines due to the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declaring bankruptcy. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customer's Bitcoins likely due to theft. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 Bitcoin, or about 7% of all the Bitcoins in existence. Due to this crisis, the price of a Bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.
Proof-of-work schemes.
The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are SHA-256, which was introduced by Bitcoin, and scrypt, which is used by currencies such as Litecoin. The latter now dominates over the world of cryptocurrencies, with at least 480 confirmed implementations.
Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include Blake-256, CryptoNight, HEFTY1, Quark, SHA-3 (Keccak), scrypt-jane, scrypt-n, X11, and X13.
Some cryptocurrencies, such as Peercoin, use a combined proof-of-work/proof-of-stake scheme, while others such as Nxt exclusively use proof-of-stake.
List of cryptocurrencies.
This is a list of cryptocurrencies. By May 2014 there were more than 275 cryptocurrencies available for trade in online markets.

Static in Transmission

Static in Transmission is the 8th studio album by the Canadian new wave band Spoons. Released in early 2011 on CD and iTunes, it is their first album of new material in 23 years since 1988's "Vertigo Tango".
Background and writing.
After playing the new song "Imperfekt" live at a 2010 concert in Toronto, the band was approached by Universal music to record an album of all new material. Following this, the band released a promo CD single for "Imperfekt", b/w "Breaking In" in July 2010. Two additional new songs from the album were previewed online in Dec. 2010.
In an Dec. 2010 interview, Gordon Deppe explained "It wasn't until we recorded Imperfekt that I thought we had something. At a Spoons rehearsal, everyone went, 'wow, what's that.' And seeing that reaction got me excited. I am very self-doubting when I do anything creative, but the moment I get a little spark and some affirmation, I go, 'okay,' and will write more." According to Deppe, the remaining songs were written in a six-month period in 2010 and roughly in the order they appear on the album.
The album was recorded at Producer Jeff Carter's studio in Guelph, Ontario using the PreSonus recording system. The music video for the first single "You Light Up" was filmed in Toronto, Ontario.
Cover art.
The cover for the CD features a picture of Sandy Horne and Gordon Deppe and numerous symbols and signs including Morse code, circuit diagrams and even hieroglyphics. Fans who purchased the album were challenged to find secret codes that would unlock two additional bonus downloads on the band's official website.

26 Years (film)

26 Years () is a 2012 South Korean film based on the popular 2006 manhwa serialized online by cartoonist Kang Full. It is the fictional story of five ordinary people (a sports shooter, a gangster, a policeman, a businessman, and head of a private security firm) who band together in order to assassinate the man responsible for the massacre of innocent civilians in Gwangju in May 1980.
Plot.
The story deals with one of the most tragic and critical events in South Korean history. On May 18, 1980 in the city of Gwangju, state troops were ordered to open fire on civilians, killing and wounding thousands. Former president Chun Doo-hwan is believed to have given the order, and although he is not named explicitly in the film, the target of the assassination attempt is clearly meant to represent Chun, who was convicted in 1996 of crimes related to the Gwangju Massacre, but later pardoned by President Kim Dae-jung.
26 years later in 2006, five people who consider themselves as some of the biggest victims of the massacre, plot a top-secret project to exact revenge by assassinating the man responsible. Kwon Jung-hyuk is a newly recruited policeman who lost his family in the massacre; he is now responsible for the cars that have access to the target's house. Kwak Jin-bae is a young gangster from an organized crime group whose father was also killed. Olympic sharpshooter Shim Mi-jin, a CEO from a large company and the director of a private security firm are also involved. As a former president, "that man" lives under police protection in an affluent district of Seoul, but through a combination of ingenuity, skill, and well-placed money they are able to draw within shooting distance of their target.
Production.
Kang Full's webtoon illustrated the brutal suppression by the dictatorial administration of the time, putting emphasis on the overcoming of interpersonal and societal barriers.
In 2008, the film was originally set to be directed by Lee Hae-young based on his own adapted screenplay titled "29 Years", with Ryoo Seung-bum, Kim Ah-joong, Jin Goo, Chun Ho-jin, and Byun Hee-bong cast in the lead roles. But the production came to a halt once investors pulled out from funding the film ten days before filming began because of its controversial politically sensitive content, and rumors were rife that the pressure had originated from the conservative government.
After nearly four years of languishing in pre-production limbo due to financial difficulties, online donations poured in from 15,000 individuals amounting to (US$646,000), with singer Lee Seung-hwan contributing another (US$923,000), toward the film's (US$4,246,000) production cost. Another investor was television personality Kim Je-dong. The crowdfunding enabled the production to finally begin filming Lee's script with a new cast and director on July 19, 2012. Filming wrapped on October 10, 2012. The film's ending credits roll for more than 10 minutes, as they include all 15,000 donors' names. Director Jo Geun-hyun said at the movie's press conference, "When one does something terribly wrong and hurts others, they should at least apologize. And even if he or she chooses not to, they should be punished for what they’ve done. This is common sense, not some political idea."
Box office.
The film debuted at the top of the box office, selling 1,108,714 tickets in only a single week on release. It reached 2.5 million admissions in mid-December 2012, resulting in a total of nearly 3 million in January 2013.
Awards and nominations.
2013 Baeksang Arts Awards
2013 Buil Film Awards

Loring Air Force Base Double Cantilever Hangar

The Loring Air Force Base Double Cantilever hangar (officially known as Building 8280) is the largest structure at the former Loring Air Force Base, now the Loring Commerce Centre. The hangar measures approximately by and appurtenances cover . It was built with the capability of holding five B-36 Peacemaker, or six B-52 Stratofortress aircraft. The main hangar building was built in 1954 at a cost of $4.6 million.
Description.
The hangar was constructed as one of the first hangars at Loring Air Force Base, which had opened two years prior to the opening of the hangar. The building was constructed with the goal of giving the Strategic Air Command crews a place to sustain an aircraft's condition should behavior by the Soviet Union warrant an attack. It also had the added benefit of protecting the crews from the harsh Maine weather. Having the capability to house five B-36 Peacemaker aircraft was critical, as the base was originally designated to host over one hundred of these aircraft. It was also one of the first double-cantilever hangars built for the Strategic Air Command, due to a new demand for a larger and more efficient space, in contrast to the World War II-era buildings which they inherited on many other bases. The building has an ejected caisson foundation designed to ensure stability in the harsh conditions of northern Maine. The foundation consists of 260 diameter concrete caissons that extend down to limestone bedrock at a depth of . Longitudinal arched steel trusses that are cantilevered at both ends from the shop supports in the center allow maximum vertical clearance. The north and south walls of the hangar each have a set of six doors that, when fully open, form a wide opening that accommodates the full wingspan of a B-36.
Post-closure usage.
After the 1994 closure of Loring Air Force Base, many of the buildings were evaluated for historical significance in the "Loring AFB Historic Building Inventory and Evaluation". The hangar was one of a handful of structures on the base that were listed for possible future inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its historic nature. This view was concurred by the Maine State Historic Preservation Officer and the Air Force's recommendation of the Historic American Buildings Survey. The hangar is one of several Loring AFB buildings that have new uses as components of the Loring Commerce Centre.

Chitrasena (Mahabharata)

Chitrasena, a minor character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, was a Gandharva king who taught song and dance to Arjuna. He resided in Indra's palace along with his fellow Gandharvas and Apsaras. He also routed the army of Duryodana and Karna in a minor skirmish that took place before the Kurukshetra War.
As Arjuna's teacher.
Chitrasena is introduced in the epic in the Vana Parva, as a teacher of music by Indra. Indra foresaw that Arjuna would have to spend one year at King Virata's palace as a eunuch, during which time he would need the knowledge of music and dance. He wanted Arjuna to be trained by the king of the Gandharvas, Chitrasena. Chitrasena began his classes soon and the two also became good friends.
When Urvashi cursed Arjuna to remain a eunuch for life, it was Chitrasena along with Indra who mediated with her to reduce the tenure of her curse to a single year. Chitrasena was able to achieve this by narrating to her the story of the Pandavas and the bravery of Arjuna.
Skirmish with Kauravas.
In another incident in the Mahabharata, Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni, the 99 brothers of Duryodhana, and their wives, with a medium-sized army, were camping at the Dwaitavana in order to track down the Pandavas and jeer at them during their exile. They reached the forest and were taken in by its splendour. Duryodhana planned to swim in the beautiful lakes of the forest along with his wives. But Chitrasena was already camping there along with his Gandharva family and did not want mortals to invade his territory.
Duryodhana was enraged when Chitrasena's soldiers denied him an entry into the beautiful lakes of the Dwaitavana. He gathered his army and along with Karna and others, launched a savage attack on the Gandharvas. Karna fought with Chitrasena , with the latter being thoroughly dominated by the former. When Chitrasena realized that he would not able to defeat or kill Karna, he tried to capture the women of the Kauravas. Karna realized his intentions and took away the all the women to safety. After Karna had gone, Chitrasena made Duryodhana his prisoner. 
Some soldiers went to the place where the Pandavas were residing and requested them to free Duryodhana. Yudhisthira ordered his brothers to rescue Duryodhana from the Gandharvas. The 4 Pandavas reluctantly hurried off and fought with Chitrasena's army, with Arjun fighting Chitrasena with celestial weapons. Arjuna requested Chitrasena to release Duryodhana. On his request, Chitrasena released Duryodhana. Arjuna also introduced Chitrasena as his dance teacher to his brothers. 
Duryodhana was so embarrassed, by this incident, that he wanted to commit suicide, but was halted by Karna, who had returned after taking the Kaurava women to safety. Karna subsequently swore to kill Arjuna and vowed never to drink wine until he kills him.

Col du Bonhomme

The Col du Bonhomme ( ; ) is a mountain pass in the Vosges Mountains of France. The pass connects Kaysersberg (Haut-Rhin) with Saint-Dié-des-Vosges (Vosges) (east – west) and is also crossed by the Route des Crêtes (north – south). The pass takes its name from the nearby village of Le Bonhomme, 6 km to the east.
History.
Between 1871 and 1918, the pass was a border crossing between Lorraine (France) and Alsace, which had been ceded to Germany under the Treaty of Frankfurt. A stone marking the former border is situated 100 m south of the pass on D148 (Route des Crêtes).
During World War I, the pass was the scene of fighting between French and German soldiers. On 8 September 1914, the commander of the French 41st Infantry Division, 69-year old General Bataille, and six of his men were killed in a German artillery attack. A memorial to the General and his men stands at the pass.
Details of climbs.
From the east, the climb starts at Ammerschwihr, passing through Kaysersberg and Le Bonhomme en route. From this direction, the total ascent is 22.1 km long climbing 714 m at an average percentage of 3.2%, with a maximum of 7.4%.
From the west, the climb starts at Saulcy-sur-Meurthe passing through Fraize. This climb is 20 km long, at an average of 2.8%, climbing 564 m. The maximum gradient is 6.5%.
The pass can also be reached from Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines via the Route des Crêtes (D48), passing Col des Bagenelles () and Col du Pré de Raves () en route, with the highest point reached at , 3.5 km before the Col du Bonhomme. The total distance is 18.4 km gaining 589 m in height at an average of 3.2%. The central section, the last 7 km before the Col du Pré de Raves averages 6.5%.
Tour de France.
The climb over the pass has been used in the Tour de France cycle race, the first time being on the penultimate stage of the 1949 tour, an individual mountain time trial won by Fausto Coppi.

German Central Library for the Blind

The German Central Library for the Blind (), abbreviated DZB, is a public library for the visually impaired located in the city of Leipzig, Saxony, Germany. Its collection of 72,300 titles is amongst the largest in the German speaking countries. The institution consists of a lending library, a publishing house, and a research center for barrier-free communication. It also has production facilities for braille books, talking books, and braille music. The DZB publishes about 250 new titles annually. Founded in 1894, the DZB is the oldest library for the blind in Germany.
History.
A private association, the Society for the Procurement of Large-print Books and Work Opportunities for the Blind (), was established in Leipzig in 1894 to provide blind persons with literature and employment. It was set up in a bookseller's house and grew into the first library for blind persons in the German Empire. Soon afterward the society established its own publishing house and printing press. A charitable foundation, the "Verein zur Förderung der Deutschen Zentralbücherei für Blinde", was established in 1916 to support and promote the library. By this time over 5,000 braille volumes were available and it had 1,200 regular users.
Following World War I, the number of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The Great Depression forced the library into a rigid austerity, resulting in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the commercial publishing house "Druckhaus Klepzig" on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set up at an alternative site at Döbeln in 1944.
In the immediate aftermath of World War II the DZB moved to new quarters on the Weißenfelser Straße with a collection of 1,802 books. Through a decision of the provincial government on 7 November 1946 the library was declared a public institution. By 1949 the library's collection had reached 10,000 volumes. In 1952 DZB came under the auspices of the East German Ministry of Education and in 1955 it was subject to the Ministry of Culture. In 1954 the library moved into the building still in use today in Gustav-Adolf-Straße (Gustavus Adolphus Street).
Following German reunification the DZB became an agency of the State Ministry of Science and Arts of the new Free State of Saxony.
Collection.
As of December 2011 the library holds some 72,300 titles. A research section holds books, periodicals and monographs on visual impairment. In addition, the DZB regularly publishes 18 different journals in Braille and in audio versions. The DZB's collection includes:
Each year the DZB produces about 250 new titles. It has a staff of 77 employees, 15 of whom are persons with disabilities.
Braille music facilities.
The "DaCapo" project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Health, began at the DZB in 2003 to produce specialty sheet music for the blind. The goal is not only to make musical scores more widely available to the visually impaired, but also to improve career opportunities for blind musicians. The DZB's research center is also developing processes for the computer-assisted production of sheet music in Braille and as well as transmission services.
The "MakeBraille" rendering service accepts digital musical notation files over the Internet in CapXML and MusicXML formats to produce sheet music in Braille format, available for private, non-commercial uses only.

Graben Tour

The Graben Tour () is a mining history footpath in the north of the former district of Freiberg in the German Free State of Saxony. It follows the course of an old mining water channel, in the valley of the Bobritzsch, from Krummenhennersdorf to Reinsberg. 
History.
The name of the walk is derived from the artificial water channel or "Kunstgraben" that was laid here between 1844 and 1847 to supply water for the mining industry, "Graben" being German for "ditch". The channel was used to make water available for overshot wheels ("Kunsträder") and reversible wheels ("Kehrräder") at the 4th Shaft ("IV. Lichtloch") and the two Schwamkrug turbines at the 5th Shaft ("V. Lichtloch"), which were used to transport the rock extracted from the "Rothschönberger Stolln" mine and for water management.

Singarasa

Singarasa was a local chieftan holding the title of Maha-Samantha (prince of a subjugated region), who had his headquarters at Arasikere, Hassan district, Karnataka, India, in the 12th century CE. He was a popular chieftan of his time, and several places in Karnataka are named after him, for example Singatagere (Arasikere taluk), Singanamane (Bhadravathi taluk), Singanagadde (N.R. Pura taluk) and Singasandra. Several chieftans with the same or similar names ruled various parts of Karnataka from the 10th century CE onwards.
Mahasamantha.
Singarasa ruled Arasiyakere (present-day Arasikere) when Vira Ganga Bittideva was king at Dorasamudra, the capital of the Hoysala Empire. Singarasa was the son and successor of Nagavarma; Bhutarasa was Singarasa's son and successor.
Relocated to Kanakatte.
An inscription dated 1132 states that Singarasa was relocated from Arasikere to Kanakatte, where he built a temple named Bettadakalideva for Shiva by installing a linga. He also built another temple, which he named Singeshwara after himself, as was the prevailing practice.

Boris Solotareff

Boris Solotareff (October 23, 1889 – July 1966) was a Russian painter. He was active in Munich, Switzerland, and France, but spent the majority of his career in New York where he became a naturalized American citizen in 1949. Solotareff made use of a variety of styles; according to the "Benezit Dictionary of Artists", his "work was in the mainstream of Eastern European Expressionism, with influences of Art Deco from the time when he lived in Paris." Solotareff's paintings have been exhibited widely, including the "Cinquantenaire Du Symbolisme" exhibition at the Bibliothèque Nationale (1936), the Vendome Galleries (New York, 1938), and the "Exhibition of oils and water colors" at the Charles Barzansky Galleries from October 1–20, 1940.
Biography.
Born in Bender, Bessarabia, Solotareff began his art studies at the Russian art school in Odessa, Ukraine. This went on until he turned 18 in 1907 when the artist moved to Munich, Germany enrolling at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste. After seven years in Munich, Solotareff moved to Lausanne, Switzerland. In the six years he stayed there his style underwent a change from the German Impressionist style that inspired his Munich paintings to one more influenced by Fauvism. In describing two of Solotareff's paintings from that period, "Meadow of Wild Flowers" and "Farm in Lausanne", James Gardner wrote "The paint has been thickly applied in elongated, energetic jabs that sway and pulsate in every direction like schools of fish. But only the surface seems agitated. Farther down there is the deep and reassuring calm that seems best to typify the Russian artist's sanguine disposition". 
The year 1920 found Solotareff traveling in France and Italy before settling in Paris where, under the influence of Pablo Picasso and Marie Laurencin, he began to paint in a more neo-classical style. While in Paris, Solotareff was a member of the Salon des Indépendants. In 1937, the artist moved to New York, where he lived and painted for the rest of his life.

Morrell Park community

Morrell Park is an aboriginal community, located within the town of Broome in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.
History.
The Morrell Park area (Lot 82) was originally developed by Mr John Morrell for use as a citrus and cashew nut plantation in the 1970s. The Aboriginal Lands Trust subsequently purchased Lot 82 and called for applications fromIndigenous people interested in establishing horticultural projects based upon single family enterprise and leases were issued. Over subsequent years it was found that the conditions were unsuitable for horticulture, and the area evolved into a rural residential area with blocks leased from the ALT to around 23 families.
Governance.
Morrell Park is not a traditional community in that blocks are individually leased, and as such no community association exists to represent their interests. Individual lease holders negotiate directly with service providers.
Town planning.
Morrell Park Layout Plan No.1 was prepared in accordance with State Planning Policy 3.2 Aboriginal Settlements, and was endorsed by the community on 1 December 2005 and the WAPC on 6 March 2007. The map-set can be viewed at http://www.planning.wa.gov.au/CommunityLayoutPlans/2706.asp

Spanish National Center for Biotechnology (CNB)

The National Center for Biotechnology (CNB) forms part of the Spanish National Research Council(CSIC), the largest public research institution in Spain.
The CNB was founded in 1992 to promote research in advanced biotechnology and molecular biology, and to act as a link between basic research and industrial applications.
Mission.
The mission of the CNB is the generation of excellent scientific knowledge and its application to solving human and animal health issues, environmental, and agricultural challenges, whilst collaborating with industries and ensuring the transfer of technology.
The CNB is committed to the training of highly qualified personnel. It offers biotechnology-oriented counselling to companies and public institutions as well as an important communication of its scientific activity in specialized journals and press media.
The most relevant missions of the CNB are the following:
Research.
The CNB is a multidisciplinary research centre whose greatest efforts are concentrated in the areas of structural biology, molecular biology, virology, microbiology, plant biology, immunology and oncology, and systems and synthetic biology.
The CNB is a multidisciplinary research centre whose greatest efforts are concentrated in the areas of structural biology, molecular biology, virology, microbiology, plant biology, immunology and oncology, and systems and synthetic biology. In all cases, special emphasis is placed on transforming the knowledge generated into applications to benefit mankind.
Specific projects focus on structural biology of large macromolecules, genomics and functional proteomics, development of biocomputing tools, control of cell growth and cancer, mechanisms of aging and apoptosis, development of animal models for chronic autoimmune diseases, infectious and cancer-like diseases, construction of vaccines for humans and farm animals, development of tools to improve plant productivity and resistance to environmental stress, development of new processes for environmental recovery based on microorganisms, production of antibiotics and hydrolytic enzymes, and discovery of immunomodulatory compounds.
Finally, an overarching Program on Systems and Synthetic Biology provides computational and materials tools for modelling complex biological phenomena and reprogramming them in a biotechnological direction.
Technology Transfer.
As a biotechnology center, the CNB also has important biotechnological production, and over the 2005-2009 period signed 225 research contracts with companies around the world (amounting to 37.4 M€).
During the same period, 87 patents were applied for, of which 33 were for new inventions; another 33 were applications for entry into the international PCT phase and the rest (21) mainly for European and US applications. Out of these, 13 patents have been licensed.
Likewise, five biotechnology companies have been established by CNB scientists during the 2005-2009, some of them in the CNB spin-off incubator. All this gives a clear idea of the institute’s biotechnological edge. The CNB is a member of ASEBIO (the largest Spanish biotechnological business association) and maintains regular contacts with other members in search of common matters of interest; these include a number of joint grants for which companies and the CNB have applied to different government agencies. Of these, 12 projects were granted from 2005-2009 in programs such as PETRI and PROFIT (amounting to 1.87 M€).
Organization.
It is currently one of the largest Spanish research institutes, with a total staff of 676 (December 2011), of which 381 are scientific staff (65 PIs, 10 research associates, 113 PhD students and 198 postdoctoral scientists), and 236 technical and administrative staff.
The CNB is currently divided in five departments:

SS Egypt

SS "Egypt" was a passenger liner that sunk after a collision with the , on 20 May 1922 in the English Channel. 252 people were rescued from the 338 passengers and crew on board at the time. A subsequent salvage operation recovered most of the cargo of gold and silver.
Early career.
The "Egypt" was built at Greenock on the River Clyde and launched in 1897. She generally worked on the United Kingdom to India route but served as a hospital ship during the First World War.
The Final Voyage.
"Egypt" departed from Tilbury, Essex on 19 May 1922 carrying just 44 passengers as well as a cargo of gold and silver bullion and gold sovereigns worth over £1 million (around £200 million at the 2012 gold price). 
The voyage proceeded normally until the early morning of the 20 May when fog was encountered. As a safety measure Captain Collyer greatly reduced the speed of the ship. The "Egypt" remained in fog until the afternoon when the navigator was able to sight landmarks on the French coast and fix the ship's position.
After continuing the voyage for several hours a dense fog bank was suddenly encountered at around 7 o'clock. The engines were stopped but almost immediately afterwards a fog whistle was heard. A ship emerged through the fog and within seconds the other ship (the ) crashed into the port side of the "Egypt". The "Seine" had a strengthened bow for ice-breaking and this penetrated deeply into the "Egypt" before the ships drifted apart.
An SOS was transmitted and replies were received from the and but the "Egypt" sank in less than 20 minutes before either ship arrived. Most of the passengers and crew were able to abandon ship in the lifeboats which were picked up by the "Seine".
The Salvage.
With such a valuable cargo salvage attempts soon began but the wreck of the "Egypt" was not located until 1930. She was found to be lying upright in a depth of making the recovery extremely difficult with the technology of the time. Giovanni Quaglia (From the Genoese company "Società Ricuperi Marittimi" (So.Ri.Ma.)) was in charge of the operation and decided to use a diver in an armoured suit to direct the placing of explosives to blast through the ship to expose the strong room. The diver was then used to direct a grab which picked up the gold and silver. The salvage continued until 1935 by when 98% of the contents of the strong room had been recovered.

William Felton (coachmaker)

William Felton was a London coachmaker from 36 Leather Lane in Holborn, and 254 Oxford Street near Grosvenor Square, and noted for his 1796 illustrated two-volume ""A Treatise on Carriages; comprehending Coaches, Chariots, Phaetons, Curricles, Gigs, Whiskies, &c Together with their Proper Harness in which the Fair Prices of Every Article are Accurately Stated."" William Felton wrote in the book's introduction that he had no literary pretensions, but rather that his aim was to produce an authoritative guide to the construction, maintenance and repair of horse-drawn coaches. The "Monthly Review" agreed that it was not a literary masterpiece, but praised it for its encyclopaedic treatment of the subject. "The Sporting Magazine" in its sixth issue was equally complimentary about Felton's "Treatise". 
Richard Trevithick's 1803 London Steam Carriage was the first steam-powered vehicle designed for transporting passengers around London, but was never a commercial success. The carriage was carried by ship from Falmouth to London and arrived at Felton’s carriage works in Leather Lane in April 1803. Felton constructed the body, designed to accommodate eight people. The driver steered the front wheel using a tiller, with the engineman on a low step behind the coach. In July 1803 it was driven for some ten miles to Paddington then back through Islington with 8 passengers, and as a precaution streets were closed to other vehicles. On one of the vehicle's test runs it tore down 7 yards of garden railing, causing London's first motor accident. 
In the 1980s a full-size replica of the London steam carriage was constructed. It was driven on the streets of Camborne on 28 April 2001, and in July 2003 retraced some of the original route between the Felton works in Leather Lane and St Cross Street. A plaque marking the route was unveiled. ""William FELTON’s carriage works was close to this spot. In 1803 he built a carriage powered by a steam engine designed and supplied by Richard TREVITHICK, the great Cornish engineer. The carriage made several trips from here with up to about 8 passengers. In July of that year, one trip was made via Greys Inn Lane, Dorset Square and Tottenham Court Road to Paddington, returning the same day via Islington. This was the first self-powered vehicle to run in the streets of London and the world’s first self-powered road people carrier. The London Steam Carriage heralded the age of the car. This plaque was unveiled by Francis Trevithick Okuno, descendent of Richard Trevithick, on July 6th 2003"”.
In the 1806 publication ""A List of Bankrupts with their Dividends and Certificates, &c. &c. for the last Twenty Years and Six Months from January 1, 1786 to June 24, 1806 inclusive"", William Felton's name is entered on 3 December 1803. The 1823 edition of ""Kent's Original London Directory"" lists W. J. Felton of 6 Long Acre Street as being a coachmaker.

Set It Off (band)

Set It Off are an American pop-punk/symphonic rock band based in Tampa, Florida. They gained a following through vocalist Cody Carson's YouTube following on his channel rockmaniac89 and were subsequently signed by Equal Vision Records after releasing a string of successful extended plays.
History.
Formation (2008).
Cody Carson met Dan Clermont in high school when the two were in the marching band together and became friends. Austin Kerr and Zach Dewall were in a band together prior to the formation of Set It Off. They played local shows with the band that Carson was in at the time. Then, Carson left for Ohio to attend the Oberlin Conservatory of Music as a classical clarinet student. In his first year, after exchanging a series of YouTube videos with him, Carson asked All Time Low's frontman Alex Gaskarth if he could sing Coffee Shop Soundtrack on stage at their at-the-time upcoming concert at the Cleveland House Of Blues via a YouTube video, to which Gaskarth agreed. That performance helped Carson confirm his dream of starting a rock band, and not long after Carson then dropped out of college using his school money to come back and start up the band. Dewall and Kerr were amongst the first to follow. Dan Clermont also joined the band. James was the band's original drummer but left and was replaced by Blake Howell on drums. Blake soon left the band and was replaced by Benji Panic (Benjamin Panico) on drums; however, they have since parted ways so that Ben could pursue his GED and later to start his own photography studio. The current drummer for the band, whom they found through the internet, is Maxx Danziger.

Equal Vision Records will match the band’s donation amount, doubling the total amount for the organization.
“We’re honored to be working with VH1 Save The Music. If it wasn’t for the music education program in my high school, Set It Off would not exist,” states founding member and frontman Cody Carson. “I would not have met our guitarist, Dan Clermont, I wouldn’t have been directed toward Oberlin Music Conservatory, and I wouldn’t end up with even half of the musical knowledge I possess now. More people need to be able to experience the unity, leadership skills, and work ethic taught by being involved in music education programs in schools. Set It Off strongly endorses this organization for these, among many other, reasons. We’re so excited to raise money for them and help spread the word about the importance of music education.”
The album debuted at the 174 position on the Billboard 200, 4 on the Top Heatseekers, and 38 on the Independent Albums chart.
Music Videos.
Set It Off has 7 music videos released for the songs Pages and Paragraphs, Hush Hush,@reply, Horrible Kids, Breathe In, Breathe Out Swan Song and Partners In Crime. Official lyric videos have also been released for the songs I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, Swan Song, and Kill The Lights.
Touring.
Set It Off is primarily a touring band and most of their year is filled traveling and putting on shows to further expand their fanbase in order to reach out to more people through their music. The band has currently played in over 19 tours. Set It Off is also accompanied on tour by their merch guy Marshall Travers, and tour manager, Andrew Cramb. Cramb attended private school with several members of the band and has been on tour with them since 2009. However Cramb has backed down from this position after graduating college. In 2013, Set It Off toured Europe with Yellowcard. Set It Off played Warped Tour 2013 from 6/15-7/3, 7/6-8/4. They are also currently looking forward to touring with We Are the In crowd for the Reunion Tour in February, March, and April of 2014.
Second Studio Album (2014 - Present).
On the 2nd of January, Equal Vision Records released a video on their YouTube page, announcing that Set It Off would be recording a new album with John Feldmann, which would be released sometime in 2014
Musical style and influences.
In the beginnings of the band, Set It Off fit more into a synth pop punk genre. Now the band has matured and define themselves as orchestral pop punk, however the majority of the orchestral string sounds are programmed and sequenced synthesizers added during production rather than traditionally recorded acoustic instruments. The band's influences include, Fall Out Boy, Four Year Strong, My Chemical Romance, All Time Low, New Found Glory, A Day To Remember, Forever The Sickest Kids, Relient K, and We The Kings.
In 2008, lead singer Carson declared All Time Low as his favorite band. He has also credited New Found Glory's Jordan Pundik as the artist who most influenced his lyrical style.

Philippe Neerman

Philippe Neerman (1930–2011) was a Belgian industrial designer and President of Industrial Design Planning Office Philippe Neerman & Co. N.V.\S.A. He was known for his application of ergonomics in public transportation systems and his work on major projects such as the Royal Library of Belgium, the Royal Castle of Laeken, and the Royal Palace of Brussels. He also participated in the international Design Biennale Interieur in Courtray, Belgium. He mainly focused on transportation and made designs for metros and trams including the Euro Tram, the Brussels Metro, and the Metro in Barcelona. His work has been incorporated into a diverse collection of museums, including the Ghent Design Museum.
Early life.
Neerman was born in 1930 in the Belgian Congo to a Belgian father and a French mother. He grew up in Brussels in an artistic family but made many trips to France during his childhood, including during the World War II era. In Ghent, Belgium, he studied interior design, furniture design and management.
Career.
Neerman graduated from L'École de la Cambre in 1953. After his studies, Neerman moved to Kortrijk, where he worked for a company named De Coene, a Belgian art decore and design firm. He was involved with setting up the Brussels Design Centre after beginning his work with De Coene and claims to be the originator of the Centre. As he indicated himself in the mid-1950s several fellow designers were won over to the goal of having a Brussels-based DC. During the end of his career at De Coene, he designed the "Philips Chair" for the company’s home office in Eindhoven. He was commissioned in 1955 by the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs to set up the Institute of Industrial Aesthetics and the Design Centre.
Neerman created his own company in 1967 and was among the first European industrial designers to adapt ergonomic studies to the design of public transportation while working on projects such as the Metro of Brussels, and the Metro of Lyons & Marseille. After working on numerous transportation system projects, he began to concentrate on different transportation systems such as buses, trains, people movers, and tramways. During that time, he also focused on interior and furniture design for different buildings.
Neerman was a professor at the National Higher Institute of Architecture and Urbanism in Antwerp until 1995.
Publications.
Neerman's works have been incorporated in different publications such as journals and books, including the le Soir, Tram, and Bouwen voor de natie.
Personal life.
Neerman married Denise Kinet in 1952 and had 2 sons, Olivier Neerman and Johan Neerman. Johan took over the family business in 1999.

Wince

Wince (foaled 28 April 1996) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from June 1998 to May 1999 she ran nine times and won four races. After winning twice from six starts as a two-year-old, she won the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury. On her next appearance Wince won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. On her only subsequent appearance she finished unplaced in the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later. At the end of her three-year-old season she was retired from racing to become a successful broodmare.
Background.
Wince, a large, powerful bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock, on her left foreleg was bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdulla's Juddmonte Farms. Wince was sired by Selkirk an American-bred miler who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. As a breeding stallion, Selkirk's progeny include fifteen Group One winners including Cityscape Dubai Duty Free, Leadership Gran Premio di Milano and Kastoria Irish St Leger. Her dam, Flit, won one minor race and was a full sister to the American racemare Skimble (Dahlia Handicap).
Wince was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Kieren Fallon.
Racing career.
Wince began her career by finishing third in a five furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 1 June. A month later she was moved up to seven furlongs and recorded her first win in a maiden at Kempton Park. Wince was then moved up to Listed class and finished second to the favourite Fairy Queen in the Star Stakes at Sandown Park. The filly's second win came at Chester in August when she started at odds of 4/9 and won the six furlong Combermere Stakes by four lengths. Wince then returned to Listed class for the Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket in October. She started 5/2 favourite but after Fallon struggled to obtain a clear run in the closing stages she finished fifth of the ten runners behind the 33/1 outsider Snittenby. Despite her defeat, Wince was made 9/4 favourite for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes two weeks later. After being in touch for the leaders for most of the way, she made no impression in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Hula Angel. Her performances had been promising, but did not suggest that she was a likely classic winner. Timeform expressed the opinion that Wince was unlikely to stay beyond seven furlongs.
Wince thrived over the winter of 1998/9 but only became a contender for the 1000 Guineas after her stable's leading filly, Bionic, was ruled out of the race by injury. On her three-year-old debut, Wince was sent to Newbury to contest the seven furlong Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the Guineas. Fallon restrained the filly in the early stages before sending her into the lead a furlong from the finish to win by one and a half lengths from the Mill Reef Stakes winner, Golden Silca. Sixteen days after her Newbury win, Wince started 4/1 favourite in a field of twenty-two fillies for the 1000 Guineas. The filly had been the subject of heavy betting support after a trial gallop in which she had finished a close second to the stable's leading colt Enrique, who then finished runner-up in the 2000 Guineas. As the Rowley Mile course was being redeveloped, the race was run on the Newmarket July course for the first time since 1945. The runners split into two groups, with Fallon positioning Wince towards the rear of the group nearest the stands. In the last quarter mile, Wince moved forward under a strong drive from Fallon and took the lead of the stands-side group a furlong from the finish. Despite drifting left towards the centre of the course, she prevailed by half a length from Wannabe Grand, with Valentine Waltz, who had raced on the opposite side of the course, a short head away in third. The win gave Henry Cecil his sixth win in the race equaling the 20th century record set by his father-in-law Noel Murless.
On her next appearance, Wince started 5/4 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Fallon attempted to challenge the leaders in the final quarter mile, but Wince made no progress and finished fifth behind Hula Angel, who beat Golden Silca by a neck. After the race, Wince was examined by racecourse vets who found no serious injury, but Cecil reported that the filly "wasn't quite sound". Before she could run again, Wince later sustained a joint injury to one her hind legs which ended her racing career.
Assessment.
Timeform rated Wince at 94+ as a two-year-old and 117 at three.

Parazoanthus swiftii

Parazoanthus swiftii, commonly known as the golden zoanthid, is a species of coral in the order Zoanthidea which grows symbiotically on several species of sponge. It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean.
Description.
The golden zoanthid is a colonial coral that grows in small irregular groups and linear rows that wind over the surface of its host sponge. It does not have a calcareous skeleton but the polyps are connected by a membranous basal connection. The polyps look like small sea anemones and are orange or bright yellow and about in diameter. They have a slender column and up to twenty six long, thin, pale yellow tentacles. As much as half the surface of the sponge may be covered by the coral, which may consist of up to 200 polyps.
Distribution and habitat.
The golden zoanthid is common in the Caribbean Sea and round the Bahamas. It is also known from Jamaica, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is mostly found at depths between but occasionally occurs in shallower water. It is always found colonising a sponge, often the brown tube sponge ("Agelas conifera"), the green finger sponge ("Iotrochota birotulata") or the pink or brown "Topsentia ophiraphidites". It usually occurs in sandy or silty locations.
Biology.
The golden zoanthid often contrasts vividly in colour with its host sponge, which would be expected to advertise its presence to potential sponge predators. It contains toxic substances that may deter fish such as the rock beauty ("Holacanthus tricolo") from eating the host sponge. The golden zoanthid may also benefit from living on a sponge in that the sponge is a filter feeder and actively draws in a current of water through its pores. It can only cope with the most minute particles and the polyps may be able to capture the bigger food items wafted along in the current.
The size of a golden zoanthid colony is increased by budding. New polyps generally grow at the ends of the rows.

Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya

The Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya is the council of Baptist churches and missions in Sri Lanka.
History.
The Baptist denomination in Sri Lanka began in 1812, with the arrival of Rev. James Charter a missionary from the Baptist Missionary Society of the United Kingdom, a colleague of the legendary pioneer of the Modern Missionary movement Rev. William Carey. During early days church planting & evangelism of Ceylonese was done by the missionaries of Baptist Missionary Society with its head quarters in Britain. The first Baptist church was established in Grandpass Colombo and expanded to other areas of the Western, North Western, and Central regions of the island. The missionaries began establishing schools in the regions where they had already planted churches. These schools were also used for worship and other evangelical programs.
In 1887 Sri Lanka Baptist Mission was founded and worked along side of Baptist Missionary Society of Great Britain. In 1894 the Ceylon Baptist Union was formed. In 1924 the Baptist Missionary Society took a decision to gradually withdraw financial support and personnel from Sri Lanka. This marked the movement by which local leadership began to assert itself and the Baptist community became self supporting and take on a more truly Sri Lankan image. This gave birth to the Ceylon Baptist Union representing the local Baptist congregations. In 1944 the Lanka Baptist Mission and Ceylon Baptist Union were amalgamated to form the Ceylon Baptist Council. In 1957, soon after the social transition that was set in motion and a swing towards emphasis on the national languages the name was changed to Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya a literal translation of Ceylon Baptist Council to Sinhala in keeping with national trends in the country by an act of parliament. In 2012 Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya is celebrating its 200th anniversary since its beginnings in 1812.
Today.
At present, the Sangamaya has 25 member churches with a total congregation of approximately 7000, and in addition many mission stations. Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya coordinates the sharing of resources among Sri lankan Baptist churches and is the central point which appoints pastors to all these churches. All members churches of the Sangamaya are mission oriented, responding to the spiritual and social needs of their respective communities.
Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya includes four main departments also identified as auxiliaries:
They represent the respective groups among the Baptist population. These auxiliaries organize various programmes and activities under the guidance of the Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya to promote Christianity and strengthen belief in Jesus among the Sri Lankan Baptist community.
Fellowship.
Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya is in fellowship with other denominations in Sri Lanka through the National Christian Council (NCC), while being a member of the Baptist World Alliance, which represents the World Community of Baptist. It is also affiliated to Asian Region of Baptists represented by the Asian Baptist Federation. Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya's membership in the Christian Conference of Asia and the World Council of Churches (through NCC) links it with the Christian churches in the East and churches affiliated to the World Council of Christians.

Anna de Brémont

Anna de Brémont, (c.1856–1922), born Anna Dunphy, was an American singer, novelist, poet and journalist. She spent much of her life in England; a period in South Africa provided the material for some of her books.
Life.
She was born Anna Dunphy in New York in around 1856, and moved to Cincinnati with her mother, following her father's death. She was at one time principal singer in the choir of Cincinnati Cathedral and later a contralto soloist at Henry Ward Beecher's church in Brooklyn. She married Count Leon de Bremont, a French medical doctor in New York, and moved to Europe after his death in 1882. In London she met theatrical promoter Brandon Thomas, who set up a literary and musical tour for her, in the course of which she visited India, Australia and South Africa.
In London in 1888 she was initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn, alongside Oscar Wilde's wife Constance. She later wrote a memoir about Wilde and his mother. In the May of the same year she appeared at the Globe Theatre in London in "the Countess de Bremont's Matinee", playing Rosalind in the forest scenes from "As You Like It". The "Era" said "her style was decidedly unsatisfactory". In 1893, in the course of a review of three volumes by de Bremont, published under the general title of "The World of Music", the "New York Times" reported that "it is said that this quondam light of Cincinnati now coruscates amid the incandescents of the Mrs. Leo Hunter circle of London."
She spent some time in South Africa. On her departure from the country in June 1890, it was reported that she had a novel based on her experiences there in progress, and had begun preparing a lecture on life in the Transvaal, focussing on the social effects of the discovery of gold. "The Gentleman Digger" was published the next year, its characters thinly disguised versions of real people.
In 1894, while working for "St Paul's" magazine in London, she wrote to the librettist W.S. Gilbert requesting an interview. He replied, saying that he would cooperate in return for a fee of 20 guineas. She wrote back saying that she anticipated "the pleasure of writing Mr Gilbert's obituary for nothing". Gilbert retaliated by sending letters to the press which referred to "a lady styling herself the Countess de Brémont". She sued Gilbert for libel, claiming that he had implied that she had no right to her title. Gilbert told the court that he had no knowledge of de Brémont except for the letter, and the jury found in his favour.
She was in London during the First World War, where her experiences of German air-raids inspired her novel "The Black Opal". She died in Earls Court in 1922 and was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Kensal Green Cemetery.

Badminton cabinet

The Badminton cabinet is a monumental piece of 18th-century furniture that twice set the record for most expensive piece of furniture ever sold.
The Badminton Cabinet, or Badminton Chest, was commissioned by Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort, at the age of 19. It took thirty experts six years to make, and came to be named after the Duke's country seat, Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England, where it remained until it was auctioned by his descendants in the late 20th century.
The ebony cabinet is over 12 feet tall and shows scenes rendered in pietre dure—inlaid finely cut, polished and coloured stones, including in this case a number of semi-precious stones. The clock face set at the top of the cabinet is marked with fleurs-de-lis.
The Badminton Cabinet became the highest-priced piece of furniture in the world when it was auctioned for £8.58m million in 1990, and set the record again when it was auctioned again in 2004, this time for £19 million.

Aslan Byutukayev

Aslan Byutukayev () also known as Emir Khamzat and Abubakar is a Chechen insurgent commander in the Caucasus Emirate, the commander of the Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs and a close associate of Caucasus Emirate leader Dokku Umarov.
Until 2010 Emir Khamzat was a little-known field commander. But in the summer of that year there was a dispute between Dokku Umarov and several commanders of the Chechen wing of the Caucasus Emirate - Tarkhan Gaziyev, Muhannad, Aslanbek Vadalov and Hussein Gakayev that led to Byutukaev’s rapid promotion to commander of Chechnya’s Southwestern Front. He also succeeded the slain Said Buryatsky as leader of the Caucasus Emirate’s unit of suicide bombers, the Riyad-us Saliheen.
In January 2011 Byutukaev trained Magomed Yevloyev, the suicide bomber who carried out the bombing of Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow. Shortly before the bombing, Dokku Umarov, Byutukaev and Magomed Yevloyev filmed a video claiming responsibility for the attacks.
In March 2011 it was reported that Aslan Byutukaev had been killed in an airstrike by the Russian Air Force in Ingushetia, along with the deputy leader of the Caucasus Emirate, Supyan Abdullayev. However, while the rebels confirmed the death of Abdulayev, the death of Byutukaev was denied.
On June 2011 in a video released on the internet, a silent Byutukaev appeared at the side of Dokku Umarov as the latter claimed responsibility for the assassination of Yuri Budanov, a former Russian Colonel who kidnapped, murdered and allegedly raped an 18-year-old Chechen girl.
In July 2011 at a meeting of the Caucasus Emirate’s Sharia Court, Umarov appointed Byutukaev his deputy in the newly created Western Sector of Vilayat Nokhchicho.

Melanizing agents

Melanizing agents are drugs that increase sensitivity to solar radiation and promote re-pigmentation of de-pigmented areas of skin. Furocoumarins stimulate melanocytes and induce their proliferation on activation by light. Melanizing agents sensitize the skin to sunlight. As a result, erythema, inflammation and pigmentation occurs.
Drugs.
Psoralen is a natural drug obtained from the fruit of "Psoralea corylifolia". Methoxsalen and Trioxsalen are synthetic psoralens. These drugs can be used either topically or orally.
Topical therapy.
The drug solution is painted on the vitiliginous lesion and exposed to sunlight for around one minute. It is then occluded by a sunscreen ointment. The treatment should be undertaken for many weeks to obtain observable results. Longer exposure to sunlight might cause blistering of skin, so the therapy should be undertaken in the direct supervision of a physician.
Oral therapy.
It is done in alternate days. After 2 hours of taking the oral dose of 20 mg/day of a psoralen, skin is exposed to sunlight. Eyes, ears and other normally pigmented areas should be protected while spending time in the sun.

Beautiful Creatures (2013 film)

Beautiful Creatures is a 2013 American romantic fantasy film based upon the novel of the same name by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. The film was adapted for the screen and directed by Richard LaGravenese and stars Alden Ehrenreich, Alice Englert, Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, Emmy Rossum, Thomas Mann, and Emma Thompson.
The film was released February 14, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment.
Plot.
In Gatlin, South Carolina, Ethan Wate awakens from a recurring dream of a girl he does not know. In voice-over narration, he describes his enjoyment of reading banned books, his despair of his small-town existence, and his dreams of leaving for college. Arriving for his first day of junior year, Ethan notices newcomer Lena Duchannes, who resembles the girl he has been dreaming about. The other students do not take kindly to her and spread gossip regarding Lena's reclusive uncle, Macon Ravenwood, and suggest that her family includes devil worshippers. Overhearing these whispers, Lena tenses, and the classroom windows shatter, amplifying the fears and suspicions of the class and the townspeople at large that she is a witch.
On a drive home, Ethan nearly runs over Lena, whose car has broken down. He gives her a ride home, and the two bond over their shared love of poetry and having both lost their mothers. Ethan drops Lena off but later finds a locket and returns to the mansion to give it to her as a present. Touching the locket triggers a shared flashback to the American Civil War, after which Ethan awakens at his home. Macon disapproves of their love and fondness of each other, and conspires with Ethan's family friend, Amma, to keep the two separated. However, Ethan continues to pursue Lena until she confesses that she and her family are "casters" capable of performing magical spells that change the weather or create illusions. On her sixteenth birthday, Lena's true nature will steer her towards either the light or the dark; Lena fears the latter, as it entails being consumed by evil and hurting those she loves. Ethan insists she is responsible for her own choices and reassures her that she is a good person.
Matters are complicated by the arrival of two immensely powerful dark casters who aim to push Lena to the dark: Ridley, Lena's provocative cousin/childhood friend, and Sarafine, Lena's mother, who has possessed Mrs. Lincoln, the mother of Ethan's friend Link. Sarafine foresees that Lena will become an even more powerful caster and intends for Lena to use her newfound power to purge the Earth of humans, leaving casters to rule in their wake. Lena and Ethan use the locket to re-experience the whole flashback, which reveals their ancestors, caster Genevieve Duchannes and mortal Confederate soldier Ethan Carter Wate were in love. Ethan Carter was shot in battle, and Genevieve revived him using a forbidden spell that caused her to go dark and curse all the Duchannes family's women. They consult with Amma, who is in a seer/keeper of a caster library beneath the town library. The most ancient of these books, the "Book of Moons", reveals the secret to undoing the curse: someone Lena loves has to die. Unwilling to take Ethan's life, Lena has a final moment together with Ethan in which Lena makes it snow and then erases all his memories of their time together.
Ridley seduces Link and gives him a bullet to use in an upcoming Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Honey Hill which will take place on Lena's birthday. During the reenactment, Link and Ethan agree to "kill" each other so they can ditch the reenactment. While at the ceremony for her 16th birthday, Lena feels the shock of the curse being broken and runs off to Ethan, clutching his dying body as Ridley and Sarafine encourage her to surrender to grief and accept the dark. Lena lashes out in anger, sending lightning strikes through the crowd of reenactors until Ethan transforms into Macon, who had previously disguised himself as Ethan to become the needed sacrifice. His dying words encourage Lena to "claim yourself"; she then causes the moon to disappear, so it cannot claim her for the dark. Lena allows Ridley to flee and pulls Sarafine from Mrs. Lincoln's body, using her power to seal Sarafine's spirit away.
Six months later, a still-amnesiac Ethan stops by the library to visit Amma before leaving for an NYU college tour with Link. He apologizes to Lena for not having got to know her during their time in Gatlin. When he inquires if a "banned book" by Charles Bukowski (which she had shared with him when they first met) is any good and Lena asks him to define good (the same reply she gave the first time he asked), Lena then presents it to him as a "getting out of Gatlin present". As Link drives away, Ethan reads a passage in the book that he had earlier associated with Lena, while Lena is revealed in the caster library to be a half light/dark caster. As they drive past the town line, Ethan glimpses the town's burned welcome sign and remembers everything. The car skids to a halt, Ethan gets out of the car and yells Lena's name. She hears him call, and is freed of her dark side before the screen fades to black.
Production.
Alcon Entertainment purchased the rights to "Beautiful Creatures" in 2009, with director Richard LaGravenese signing on soon after to write and direct the movie. Casting for the film began in late 2011, and in February 2012, Viola Davis was cast as Amma. Soon after, Jack O'Connell and Alice Englert were announced to be playing the lead characters of Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes. O'Connell later dropped out of the film due to a scheduling conflict, with Alden Ehrenreich assuming the role of Ethan. Further casting included Emma Thompson as Sarafine and Mrs. Lincoln and Jeremy Irons as Lena's uncle Macon Ravenwood. Of the character of Lena, Englert stated that "Lena is like most girls when you feel massively insecure".
Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin April 23, 2012, in New Orleans, and took place, said LaGravenese, beginning "I think, April 16th, and then we shot until June 26th, and then post[-production] was for me from July 5th to December 17th." LaGravenese chose to incorporate practical special effects along with computer-based ones for certain scenes, as Emmy Rossum described: "hen we walked on to the stage and realized the chandelier does actually move, the chairs did actually spin, the table did actually spin... it was all very exciting." On September 19, 2012, the first trailer for "Beautiful Creatures" was released.
Camille Balsamo played Genevieve Katherine Duchannes in a sequence cut from the film, LaGravenese said:
Distribution.
Release.
"Beautiful Creatures"' release date was originally scheduled to be on February 13, 2013, but distributor Warner Bros. later pushed the date to Thursday, February 14, 2013. The film was still released in Sweden on the 13th, a day before the film's North American release date. The film held its official US premiere on February 11, 2013, in New York City.
Home media.
"Beautiful Creatures" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on May 21, 2013. In its first month in release, the film sold around 428,792 copies in both DVD and Blu-ray formats combined, bringing in a consumer revenue of $7,377,859. As of June 16, 2013, the film has grossed an estimated $10,151,643 in DVD and Blu-ray sales.
Reception.
Box office.
The film grossed $10,124,912 during its opening weekend (including its Thursday release date), under-performing based on media expectations.
While the film was considered to be a flop domestically, only grossing $19,452,138 by the end of its North American domestic theatrical run (against a $60 million production budget) it did better internationally, where it has grossed $40,600,000. As of April 21, 2013, the film has grossed a worldwide total of $60,052,138, barely recouping its production budget, making it a loss.
Critical reception.
The film has received average reviews from critics; it has a 46% rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 169 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: "Charming romantic leads and esteemed supporting cast aside, "Beautiful Creatures" is a plodding YA novel adaptation that feels watered down for the "Twilight" set". 
On Metacritic, the film received a score of 52% based on 40 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.
Owen Gleiberman, in "Entertainment Weekly", gave the film a "B-", writing, ""Beautiful Creatures" is arriving in a market-place full of "Twilight" junkies still eager for their supernatural teen-romantic fix, and the film's concept couldn't be clearer: It's "Twilight" with the sexes reversed. This time it's the boy who's the mortal: moody, bookish Ethan, the outsider in his sleepy small town." Gleiberman added that though the film "is lushly pictorial and not-too-badly acted... the audience, like Ethan, spends way too much time waiting around for Lena to learn whether she's a good girl or a bad girl."
The film review website "ScreenRant" called the film "a choppy and melodramatic experience with very little payoff beyond the central love story. Worse yet, overlooking the usual on-the-nose dialogue about eternal love and sacrifice, this tale of star-crossed sweethearts is especially cheesy and unconvincing – even when compared to similarly heavy-handed young adult novel-turned-movies. Fans of the supernatural romance sub-genre will get about what they expect..."
David Denby of "The New Yorker" wrote that the movie "is a classic example of the confusions and the outright blunders that can overtake talented people who commit themselves to a concept driven purely by the movie marketplace... Alas, the satirical energy and Ethan's bright talk dissipate after a while." He praises a scene from the Civil War flashback which "appears as Ethan and Lena are watching a movie in a local theatre, but only they can see it" as "an interesting idea that I wish LaGravenese had pursued as a parallel narrative. This kind of movie, however, demands not interesting ideas but whooshing spectacle and madly redundant climaxes and a soundtrack filled with thuds and a shouting female chorus."
Scott Mendelson of Forbes magazine called the film "shockingly good" and encouraged viewers who missed it to check it out on video.
Cinemascore audience polls gave the film a B grade.

Open to Export

Open to Export is a community-driven service for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) looking for support to grow internationally by exporting from the UK. The service is delivered by hibu in partnership with UK Trade & Investment (UKTI). Open to Export comprises a website – http://opentoexport.com – which allows UK-based companies to work together and share information, advice and support about export market opportunities and means of entry. The information, answers, advice and articles on Open to Export are all composed by the site’s users, community and key contributors.
History.
The site launched in beta in May 2012, during this time Open to Export limited the business sectors to technology, and the overseas markets to the US and India. Since then, the site has broadened the range of advice available: "The new service also offers market-based information on issues including legislation, company registration, finance, market research, product development and transport and logistics"
The site officially launched in October 2012. At the time of launch Lord Green, Minister of State for Trade and Investment, said: "Supporting more small and medium-sized enterprises to export is a key part of the government’s plan for growth," and went on to say "Half of the UK's exports, by value, already come from SMEs. Open to Export will provide practical assistance, advice and support to other businesses looking to make that crucial first step to sell into foreign markets." 
Local councils across the UK have also started backing the project, with Manchester and Cambridgeshire featuring information on their websites.

<doc id="36663946" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36663946" title="Ferrer block">
Ferrer block

The Ferrer block is a corner block of 15 of the 80 centésimos green 1856 'Diligencia' (Suns) postage stamps, and is regarded by many philatelists as the most important item of Uruguayan philately. Fred Melville, speaking philatelically, called it "one of the seven wonders of the world". It is the largest known multiple of this issue of which only a few blocks are known to exist. Most of the plating information about this issue has been derived from this one block.
The 'Diligencia' stamps.
The postal services in Uruguay organised by the stagecoach companies, issued on October 1, 1856 the so-called 'Diligencia' (stagecoach stamp). This issue was intended for correspondence carried by stagecoach. There were three values:
The stamps were issued in sheets of 35, printed on white woven unwatermarked paper at the Mège Lithograph Workshop of Mège y Willems Printing Ltd in Montevideo.
Largest known multiple.
The 80 centésimos green corner block of 15 is a multiple from the top right of an unused sheet of 35. It includes positions 3-5, 8-10, 13-15, 18-20, 24-25 and 30. Plating of the 'Diligencias' was made possible by the slightly shifted alignment of transfers and the common characteristics of this sheet.
This multiple originates from a complete sheet originally owned by Dr. Wonner. The ‘Soto Hermanos’ philatelic dealers broke it up into several blocks in the 19th Century. Subsequently it was part of the collection of Vicente Ferrer (who named it), Wonner, Charles Lathrop Pack, E.J. Lee, Alfred Lichtenstein, Roberto Hoffmann, Norman Hubbard, Gene Scott and Tito Giamporcaro.
Significance.
The block enabled Pack to establish new concepts on the plating of this issue, which were improved by E.J. Lee. Most plating of this issue has been derived from this block and it is considered the foundation upon which the technical philately of Uruguay is built.
In September 2009 it sold at Investphila in Switzerland for EUR 432,000, including fees.
