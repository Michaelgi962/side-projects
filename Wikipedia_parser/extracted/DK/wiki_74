Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America

Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America are a particular kind of ethnic stereotypes found both in North America, as well as elsewhere. Indigenous peoples of the Americas include Inuit, Iñupiat, Cup'ik/Yup'ik peoples and American Indians, commonly called Native Americans or First Nations (in Canada). This article primarily discusses stereotypes present in Canadian and American culture. There are more numerous and varied stereotypes about indigenous peoples than about any other ethnic group in the Americas. While some of the worst portrayals of natives as bloodthirsty savages have disappeared, oversimplified or inaccurate portrayals remain, particularly in movies, which are the main source of popular images not only in the Americas but world-wide.
The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order educate them as Euro-Americans.
"Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as "noble savages", "ignoble savages" or, most recently, simply as "casino-rich", native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted." - Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee), professors of Native American Studies at the University of Minnesota 
Ethnic terminology.
The first difficulty in addressing stereotypes is the terminology to use when referring to indigenous peoples, which is an ongoing controversy. The truly stereotype-free names would be those of individual tribes. Based upon the practical need to have a way to refer to people with common issues is the use of American Indian or Native American in the United States, First Nations or Canadian Indian in Canada. The Inuit and Eskimo peoples (never referred to as Indians) are distinct and have their own unique stereotypes.
All global terminology must be used with an awareness of the stereotype that "Indians" are a single people, when in fact there were, and continue to be hundreds of individual ethnic groups native to the Americas. This type of awareness is obvious when Euro-Americans refer to Europeans with an understanding that there are some similarities, but many differences between the peoples of an entire continent.
American Indians / Native Americans.
Stereotypes may be grouped with regard to different characteristics: physical, cultural, and historical.
Physical characteristics.
Native Americans are perceived as having one identical look, one certain shade of skin color as well as having only straight, black hair.
The assertion that Native Americans cannot grow facial hair is a common misconception and stereotype.
The common explanation for this "miracle" is that they tear out their beards until they stop growing at all. To a large extent, these stereotypes are based on famous stories by Karl May ("Winnetou"), a German teacher who wrote innumerable novels about Native Americans in the 19th century. Interestingly, May had never seen Native Americans with his own eyes.
An example of physical stereotyping guiding behavior is described by David Treuer: during the 2012 campaign for US Senate in Massachusetts, supporters of Sen. Scott P. Brown used the tomahawk chop and war whoops to express their derision of his opponent Elizabeth Warren for claiming Cherokee and Delaware ancestry. "To mock real Indians by chanting like Hollywood Indians in order to protest someone you claim is not Indian at all gets very confusing." Brown addressed the issue as being based upon Warren's lack of any documentation for her heritage. In a debate he stated that “Professor Warren claimed she was a Native American, a person of color -- and as you can see, she is not”.
Cultural misconceptions.
The Media Awareness Network of Canada (MNet) has prepared a number of statements about the portrayals of American Indians, First Nations of Canada and Alaskan Natives in the media. Westerns and documentaries have tended to portray Natives in stereotypical terms: the wise elder, the aggressive drunk, the Indian princess, the loyal sidekick, obese and impoverished. These images have become known across North America. Stereotyped issues include simplistic characterizations, romanticizing of Native culture and stereotyping by omission—showing American Indians in a historical rather than modern context.
Native Americans were also portrayed as fierce warriors and braves, often appearing in school sports teams' names until such team names fell into disfavor in the later 20th century. Many school team names have been revised to reflect current sensibilities, though professional teams such as American football's Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Redskins, baseball's Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians, and ice hockey's Chicago Blackhawks continue. Some controversial upper-level Native American team mascots such as Chief Noc-A-Homa and Chief Illiniwek have been discontinued; others like Chief Wahoo and Chief Osceola and Renegade remain. A controversy over the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo was resolved in 2012.
The use of Geronimo as the code name for Osama bin Laden in the operation that killed him is seen by some Native Americans as the continued stereotyping of Indians. 
Native American women are perceived as being sexually available and willing to have intercourse with any and every man. Such misconceptions lead to murder, rape and violence of Native American women and girls by non-Native men.
There is the stereotype that American Indians and Alaskan Natives live on reservations when in fact only about 25% do, and a slight majority now live in urban areas.
There is an assumption that Indians somehow have an intuitive knowledge of their culture and history, when the degree of such knowledge varies greatly depending upon the family and community connections of each individual.
Religion.
Indians are stereotyped as having no religion (being "heathen", not Christian).
Native Americans are perceived as worshiping objects and beings they consider sacred.
Substance abuse.
Because of the high frequency of alcoholism among some Indians and reservations, a stereotype has been applied to all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment for substance abuse by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.
Historical misconceptions.
There are numerous distortions of history, many of which continue as stereotypes.
There is an assumption that Indians lost possession of their land because they were inferior, when the reality is:
One stereotype held by non-Indians is that Indians receive special privileges that other American citizens do not. This view is based upon failure to understand the nature of the relationship between Native tribes and the American Federal government. Tribes signed treaties that grant certain rights in exchange for the cession of land, therefore, many of these "privileges" are considered treaty obligations. So education and health care have been "bought and paid for" by Native ancestors.
There is the myth that Indians are a dying race, i.e. "The Vanishing Red Man", when in fact census data shows an increase in the number of individuals who were American Indians and Alaska Natives or American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races.
Today, Native Americans are perceived as becoming rich because of gaming revenues. Not all tribes own tribal gaming operations/establishments and many tribal groups have issues on not everyone of their tribal ancestry being able to obtain paychecks if they can't prove their tribal membership roll.
Inuit stereotypes.
Inuit or Eskimo people are usually dressed in parkas, paddling kayaks, carving out trinkets, living in igloos, going fishing with a harpoon, hunting whales, traveling by sleigh and huskies, eating cod-liver oil and the men are called Nanook in reference to the documentary "Nanook of the North". Eskimo children may have a seal for a best friend.
Eskimos are sometimes shown rubbing noses together in greeting ritual, referred to as Eskimo kissing in Western culture, and only loosely based on an authentic Inuit practice known as kunik. They're also often depicted surrounded by polar bears, walruses and inaccurately, with penguins, which only live in the Southern hemisphere and not in the Arctic. Sometimes Eskimos themselves are depicted living on the South Pole, which is again wrong for the same reason.
Effect of stereotyping.
Stereotypes harm both the victims and those that perpetuate them, with effects of the society at large. Victims suffer the emotional distress; anger, frustration, insecurity, and feelings of hopelessness. Most of all, Indian children exposed at an early age internalize stereotypes, resulting in lower self-esteem, contributing to all of the other problems faced by Native Americans. Stereotypes become discrimination when the assumptions of being more prone to violence and alcoholism limit job opportunities. This leads directly to Indians being viewed less stable economically, making it more difficult for those that have succeeded to fully enjoy the benefits in the same way that non-Indians do, such as obtaining credit. For those that maintain them, stereotypes prevent learning the truth about Indians and the true history of the United States.
Research also demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot on the tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A study was first done at the University of Illinois, and then replicated at The College of New Jersey with the same results. Students were given a paragraph to read about Chief Illiniwek adapted from the University of Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot were more likely to express stereotypical views of Asian-Americans. Although Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics (as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian-Americans included negative characteristics, such as being "socially inept". This was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.
In Alabama, at a game between the Pinson Valley High School "Indians" and McAdory High School, the latter team displayed a banner using a disparaging reference to the "Trail of Tears" for which the principal of the school apologized to Native Americans, stated that the cheerleader squad responsible would be disciplined, and that all students would be given a lesson on the actual history of the Trail of Tears. Native Americans responded that it was an example of the continuing insensitivity and stereotyping of Indians in America. A similar sign was displayed in Tennessee by the Dyersburg Trojans when they played the Jackson Northside Indians.
Overcoming stereotypes.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) made efforts to improve the portrayals of Aboriginal people in its television dramas. "Spirit Bay", "The Beachcombers", "North of 60" and "The Rez" used Native actors to portray their own people, living real lives and earning believable livelihoods in identifiable parts of the country.
Unfortunately the mainstream media makes a lot of money making movies that play along with stereotypes; while accurate portrayals may be critically acclaimed they are not often made or widely distributed.

I've Got a Life

"I've Got a Life" is a single released by pop music duo Eurythmics released from the 2005 "Ultimate Collection". It is written by Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart and produced by Stewart.
Recording.
The song was one of two newly recorded tracks included on Eurythmics' second greatest hits package "Ultimate Collection" and the only one of the two released as a single (the other newly recorded track being the song "Was It Just Another Love Affair?"). The song is an electronic dance tune with uplifting lyrics of empowerment. Its music video featured Lennox and Stewart performing the song in front of many television screens showing scenes from videos spanning their Eurythmics career. Lennox also reprised her "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" image by performing the song in a man's suit (her hair was not shaved and colored orange, however). The music video for the song is directed by Matthew Rolston.
Chart information.
"I've Got a Life" returned Eurythmics to the Top 40 in the UK singles chart for the twenty-fourth time, hitting number fourteen. The song was released as a digital download in the United States, although dance remixes were issued on vinyl to nightclub DJs. The track spent three weeks at number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart at the end of 2005 and reached number thirty-one on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart.

Bicast leather

Bicast leather (also known as bi-cast leather, bycast leather or PU leather, sometimes described as split leather) is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term "PU leather") that is applied to the surface and then embossed. Because it is only used for the backing, the leather portion of this material is generally not visible in finished goods made from Bicast. Bicast was originally made for the apparel industry for glossy shoes, and recently was adopted by the furniture industry. The resulting product has an artificially consistent texture that is easier to clean and maintain, as is the case with most plastic materials.
Production and features.
The use of terms like "leather", "genuine leather" or "100% leather" in relation to this bicast treatment is considered a misrepresentation and therefore not permitted in some countries, e.g., Denmark and New Zealand. Furniture made with bicast exhibits none of the characteristics associated with aniline leather; it will not develop a patina or suppleness nor otherwise "improve with age". With constant use the polyurethane layer may crack and split free of its backing, and abrasion may cause large unsightly marks.
Modern technology permits up to four horizontal layers being taken from a single hide. The leather used in the backing of bicast is a thin layer, remaining after other layers have been removed for traditional leather work.
Furniture manufacturers say that the main benefit of bicast leather is its price. Lower grades of leather can be used during the manufacturing process, and treating with polyurethane gives a uniform shine and a long-lasting "like new" appearance. Bicast leather looks best, they say, on furniture with taut seat cushions and pillows. It can easily be cleaned with a damp cloth. New bicast leather furniture can have a slight chemical smell, but this typically dissipates about a week after the piece is exposed to air.

SEC Rule 144A

Rule 144A. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") provides a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for certain private resales of minimum $500,000 units of restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), which generally are large institutional investors that own at least $100 million in investable assets. When a broker or dealer is selling securities in reliance on Rule 144A, it may make offers to non-QIBs through general solicitations following an amendment to the rule in 2012.
Since its adoption, Rule 144A has greatly increased the liquidity of the securities affected. This is because the institutions can now trade these formerly restricted securities amongst themselves, thereby eliminating the restrictions that are imposed to protect the public. Rule 144A was implemented in order to induce foreign companies to sell securities in the US capital markets. For firms registered with the SEC or a foreign company providing information to the SEC, financial statements need not be provided to buyers. Rule 144A has become the principal safe harbor on which non-U.S. companies rely when accessing the U.S. capital markets.
Since 1990, the Nasdaq Stock Market offers a compliance review process which grants Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) book-entry access to 144A securities. Nasdaq launched an Electronic Trading Platform for 144A securities called PORTAL.
Rule 144A should not be confused with Rule 144, which permits public (as opposed to private) unregistered resales of restricted and controlled securities (within certain limits.)

Demonstration Hall

Demonstration Hall is a structure on the campus of Michigan State University. It was built in 1928 with offices, classrooms, and a riding arena for the Military Science department as a replacement for the Armory (built 1885, razed 1939). Exhibitions of agricultural stock and implements were held here, as well as athletic events. It served as the ice rink for the MSU hockey team from 1949 until Munn Ice Arena was completed in 1974. 
Today it continues to act as a drill hall for ROTC as well as providing rehearsal space and equipment storage for the Spartan Marching Band. The Bike Project is housed in the basement. Additionally, the arena that formerly held an ice rink now holds an indoor hard rink, used for both rollerhockey and indoor soccer.
Demonstration Hall is located at the south end of Demonstration Field, home to the practices of the Spartan Marching Band. Demonstration Field also plays host to the Sparty Spring Party, hosted each spring by the University Activities Board and Residence Halls Association. During Sparty Spring Party, the field is often the site of a large outdoor concert. The stage faces north, which allows the backstage area to connect to Demonstration Hall, and allows rooms in the hall to be used by artists and workers, and can serve as a green room.
The north end of Demonstration Field is home to "The Spartan". Demonstration Hall serves as the backdrop for most views and pictures of the statue. When the statue area was reconstructed in 2005, the old checkered windows on the north side of Demonstration Hall were replaced with matching glass so that the building was a more aesthetically pleasing backdrop to the new statue. In 2008 the building's multipurpose room was renovated into a marching band rehearsal space called Band Hall.

Global Rights

Founded in 1978, Global Rights is an international human rights capacity-building non-governmental organization (NGO) that works side by side with local activists in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to promote and protect the rights of marginalized populations. Through broad-based technical assistance and training, they strengthen partners to document and expose human rights abuses, conduct community outreach and mobilization, advocate for legal and policy reform, and provide legal and paralegal services. Over their 34-year history, Global Rights has worked in scores of countries to help local leaders and organizations to address human rights abuses and to lift their struggles out of isolation and onto regional and international stages, where institutions such as the United Nations and Organization of American States develop and enforce human rights standards.
At the core of their programming is a deep commitment to increase access to justice for poor and marginalized groups, promote women’s rights and gender equality, and advance ethnic and racial equality. In addition to this, they have two special initiatives—lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex rights and natural resources and human rights—that allow them to explore new program areas while targeting populations that fit within their core programming.
Global Rights is governed by a seventeen-member board of directors comprising senior lawyers, journalists, and academics and operated by a 70-member staff, two-thirds of whom work outside the United States.
How They Work.
Their headquarters in Washington, D.C. oversees their network of five field offices, located in Afghanistan, Burundi, Morocco, Uganda, and Nigeria. Through them, Global Rights also runs programs in Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Tunisia, and at the regional level in Latin America. Their headquarters and field-based staff collaborate closely on program design and implementation. Their field offices, in turn—staffed almost entirely by nationals— identify and establish partnerships with promising local nongovernmental organizations and provide training and technical assistance to them over the long term to boost their ability to provide legal and paralegal services and advocate for the basic human rights of the poor and marginalized within their communities.
Global Rights is unique among U.S.-based international human rights organizations in that they have a long-term field-based presence in the countries in which they operate and work on the ground to build local capacity. They work this way for two reasons. First, they believe that local knowledge and expertise is essential to successful administration. Their local partners know the communities in which they work, are familiar with their cultures and traditions, and often are already active in promoting the legal rights of the poor and marginalized. Second, Global Rights recognizes that long-term, systemic change can occur only if stakeholders themselves are involved. By transferring knowledge and skills to local partners, Global Rights ensures that they can continue work even after their training has come to an end.

HMS Conqueror (1881)

HMS "Conqueror" was an ironclad battleship of the Victorian Royal Navy, whose main armament was an armoured ram.
She was the first ship of the "Conqueror" class to be laid down, her only sister-ship being , which was completed some two years later. At the time of her design it was thought that ramming attacks were the most effective offensive manoevre against armoured warship, as the armour of the period was, for a short time, able to defend against the majority of contemporary guns extant. This belief was reinforced by the action at the battle of Lissa, when the Austrian battleship "Ferdinand Max" rammed and sank the Italian "Re DItalia". The Italian ship was at the time a stationary target, a detail which it appears did not receive, in naval architects minds, the attention it deserved.
The smaller guns were intended for use against small targets which could evade the ram and were not worth using the heavy artillery for. The torpedo tubes - six was the greatest number carried to date by a battleship - were placed aft and were intended for use against a target placed by accident or design astern of "Conqueror", when the main armament would be valueless.
Service history.
She was commissioned on 5 July 1887 for the Jubilee Review. She went into reserve at Devonport, becoming tender to the gunnery school "Cambridge" in 1889. She took part in manoevres on six occasions, and was not otherwise ever out of sight of land. She paid off in July 1902, and remained swinging at anchor at Rothesay until being sold in 1907.

Gareth Howell

Gareth Howell (born 6 January 1981) is a British racing driver, and multiple British Touring Car Championship race winner from 2000 to 2008.
He drove his first kart aged 4 and began his racing career aged 8. He is a former British karting champion and European Cup winner, who finished 8th in the World Finals in 1995 from 35th on the grid setting fastest lap on the way. During his karting career he raced alongside Jenson Button, Dan Wheldon, and his Zip Kart team mates Anthony Davidson and Gary Paffett.
At the age of 10, he told a TV programme that he wanted to race in the BTCC (not mentioning Formula One, which is a bigger draw for most star-struck youngsters).
At age 16 he graduated to the Fiesta si Championship and in 1998 moved up to the BTCC supporting Ford Credit Fiesta Championship. In 1998 he became the youngest race winner in the 20 year history of the Championship aged just 18. He was then runner up in the 2000 championship and winner of the Junior Cup. His prize involved a test for the works Ford Mondeo BTCC super touring team, where he recorded a faster laptime that his Fiesta peers. He made occasional appearances in the 2000 season for GR Motorsport in a Ford Focus, running in the Production class, which was known as Class B at the time. 2001 was his first full season, being part of a four-car GR Motorsport entry into the Production Class. He finished fifth overall in his class, having taken a race win in round 16 of the series at Snetterton.
In 2002 he graduated to the main division of the championship, driving an MG ZS for Team Atomic Kitten run by established touring car outfit West Surrey Racing joined by fellow debutant Colin Turkington.
Despite outperforming and outscoring Turkington, at the end of the season he was dropped from the MG program because of funding, and found himself without a full-time drive for the 2003 season. He managed to secure a number of outings during the year, including at Silverstone as team-mate to Gavin Pyper at GA Motorsport, piloting a Vauxhall Astra Coupé. He completed the final 4 two-race rounds of the championship for Team Dynamics, also in a Vauxhall, scoring 2 Independent's Cup wins.
He was planned to race for Dynamics in 2004, but after Vic Lee's team closed, Dan Eaves and his Halfords sponsorship replaced him. Howell sat out the 2004 and much of the 2005 seasons due to a lack of finance. Keen to remain with the team, he held Dan's pitboard for most of 2004.
He finally made his series return at Knockhill for Team Dynamics towards the end of 2005. He drove the team's third Honda Integra DC05 in three race weekends alongside the team's existing drivers Matt Neal and Eaves, setting pole position and taking his debut BTCC win at Silverstone, where he also set fastest lap (and holds the lap record on the National Circuit. He had hoped to continue for Team Dynamics into 2006, but because of lack of funding he instead only raced in the final four rounds of the season.
At the final meeting of 2006 on the Silverstone National Circuit, Howell qualified on pole, and won the first race, before battling through the field in the third race for another victory.
For 2007, Howell wanted a full-time drive. He signed to drive a SEAT Toledo for Motorbase Performance, scoring the team's best result in finishing 5th in a 3 year old car. He left the team mid-season, explaining that "It’s a vicious circle. We needed to develop the car through testing to get further towards the front and out of the midfield melee, but we came back from each round with so much damage that then took all the time between races to repair. We'd then go out and experience the same problem all over again."
He started 2008 without a drive, but joined BTC Racing as their test and reserve driver early in the season. He races at Thruxton and Oulton Park in place of regular driver Stuart Oliver, in the same SEAT as he drove in 2007, however he scored no points and was eliminated from both meetings before the final races.
In 2008, Howell worked with Lipscomb Abarth racing an Abarth 500.
On Saturday 3 April 2008 at Oulton Park, Howell won the first ever Zing Trofeo Abarth 500 GB with a gap of 2.693 seconds.
Away from racing, since 2010 Howell has worked as test driver for Mclaren Automotive, developing their supercar range.
He is married to Laura, and has a young daughter.

Vincent Askew

Vincent Jerome Askew (born February 28, 1966) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round (39th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft. A 6'6" guard-forward from Memphis State University, Askew played in nine NBA seasons for eight different teams. He is a cousin of rapper Teflon Don.
College career.
Askew was a Frayser High School graduate before enrolling at Memphis State University. He was a key player on the Tigers' 1984-85 squad that reached the Final Four. Askew was one of the more complete players on the team, capable of banging down low one possession and running the point the next.
After the Final Four season, Askew found himself in the midst of a debate on NCAA regulations when he briefly considered transferring to Kansas.
In October 1986, Vincent Askew was involved in a possible transfer to the University of Kansas. He did not transfer, and re-enrolled at Memphis State University in the fall of 1986. While Askew was visiting the Jayhawks, then-coach Larry Brown provided Askew with a plane ticket to fly back to Memphis to see his dying grandmother. The purchase of the plane ticket violated NCAA rules and Kansas was served with NCAA sanctions because of their recruitment of Askew, mainly involving “improper recruiting inducements totaling at least $1,244 to the above-mentioned young man.”
NBA scouts saw in Askew the kind of versatile, durable talent that would keep him in the NBA for years. Askew left after three seasons with the Tigers, a decision many scouts met with raised eyebrows.
NBA career.
Askew was picked by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round (39th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft. He was waived after 14 games, then spent three weeks with the Washington Bullets, and then drifted into the Continental Basketball Association.
He was brought back to the NBA by the Golden State Warriors to finish the 1992 season, then he went to the Sacramento Kings for part of a season, then drifted to the Seattle SuperSonics. For four years in Seattle, he contributed about six points, four rebounds, and two assists per game. Then, he was traded to the New Jersey Nets, played one game there, then was traded to the Indiana Pacers. Larry Brown, then of the Pacers, described his trade for Askew as "I don't know of too many guys in the league who are better defenders than him, and not everybody is as unselfish. He doesn't worry about minutes, doesn't worry about shots, he just worries about winning."
He also had stints with the Denver Nuggets and the Portland Trail Blazers, where he was waived for a final time in 1997-1998 season.
Askew was described as a 6-foot-6 do-everything team player who played in the post and the perimeter and was a steady defensive stopper who built a reliable jumper late in his career. The most he has ever scored in an NBA game is 21 points. In his NBA career, Askew played in 467 games and scored a total of 3,313 points. He averaged 7.1 points, 2.5 rebounds, 2.2 assists in 20 minutes per game.
Professional career outside the NBA.
Askew is the only player to be named Most Valuable Player in two straight years (1990 and 1991) in the Continental Basketball Association. He also had a stint in the World Basketball League.
Askew also played in Italy for Serie A team Arimo Bologna (1989) and Serie A2 teams Emmezeta Udine (1990–1991) and Sidis Reggio Emilia (1992).
After the NBA, Askew had some difficulties establishing himself. European basketball records indicate that at least three times he signed with various teams but refused to play with them, ending in August 2001 when he signed a contract with Roseto but did not come to Italy. Askew, according to an undated Euroleague scouting report, “is an NBA veteran that has finally, according to many, reached maturity. Vincent still has a lot of basketball left in him and wants to show the basketball people in Europe that he is indeed a reliable person.”
Retirement.
Upon his release from Portland in 1998, Askew returned to his hometown of Memphis, completed a degree in marketing and did some scouting for Memphis coach John Calipari, which piqued his interest in coaching.
He confided in George Karl, his long-time mentor from his Sonics days, and was told to go overseas. Askew went to Europe where he coached in an Italian league for three years.
Askew took the head coaching job at Elliston Baptist Academy in Memphis but was embattled to leave the job. Allegations that he had used ineligible players had landed the school in hot water with the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, potentially costing them a chance to play in the postseason, and Askew's players were not pleased with his abrasive coaching methods.
In 2004, Askew accepted the head coaching position at Rossville Christian Academy. Askew again stirred some controversy by recruiting players, which is a clear Mississippi Private School Association (MPSA) violation, but Askew did lead the RCA Rebels to the Class A State Championship.
In 2005, he contacted the ABA expansion team Tacoma Navigators' owner Michael Tuckman. Askew got a chance to hone his raw coaching skills, while the Navigators, which plays its home games at Mount Tahoma High School, marketed its coach as a former Sonic.
On August 14, 2008 at 8:13 am US/Eastern, Askew was accused of having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Ramada Inn in the 7600 Block of Kendall Drive. Askew was employed by Gulliver Preparatory School in Miami, Florida in 2007. Askew was a candidate to be a basketball coach at Gulliver, however he was just a student supervisor at the time of the incident. Police said Askew told the girl he was recruiting players for the girls' basketball team.

European Parliament election, 2009

Elections to the European Parliament were held in the 27 member states of the European Union (EU) between 4 and 7 June 2009. A total of 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were elected to represent some 500 million Europeans, making these the biggest trans-national elections in history. An additional 18 observers ("virtual MEPs") were (supposed to be) pre-elected.
Overview.
The majority of MEPs were elected on Sunday 7 June, but because of traditional polling days varying from country to country according to local custom, some countries held their elections in the three preceding days:
In seven EU member-states, other votes occurred alongside the elections to the European Parliament: a general election in Luxembourg; local government elections in Latvia, part of the United Kingdom, parts of Germany, Italy, Malta, and Ireland (as well as two by-elections in Dublin South and Dublin Central); regional elections in Belgium; and a referendum on reforming the monarchical rules of succession in Denmark that would give women the same rights through equal primogeniture.
This was the first European Parliament election that Bulgaria and Romania participated in at the same time as the other member states. When they joined the EU in 2007, they held elections for MEPs outside the normal electoral calendar.
Polls.
A poll sampling nineteen national polls predicted the following results: EPP 265 MEPs, PES 195 MEPs, ALDE 95 MEPs, GUE–NGL 40 MEPs, Greens-EFA 35 MEPs, UEN 35 MEPs. The remaining 70 MEPs were not predicted, but about 20 were expected to be gained by far-right or Libertas candidates. IND/DEM was predicted to fade away due to Libertas' expected success.
A prediction by political scientists Simon Hix (London School of Economics), Michael Marsh (Trinity College Dublin) and Nick Vivyan (London School of Economics) foresaw little change in the distribution of seats, predicting 249 seats for the EPP, 209 for the PES, 87 for ALDE, 58 for UEN or the European Conservatives, 48 for GUE–NGL, 39 for Greens–EFA, 17 for IND/DEM (resulting in its dissolution) and 29 NI; Libertas was not expected to win any seats. A later prediction saw 262 seats for the EPP, 194 for the PES, 85 for ALDE, 53 for UEN or the European Conservatives, 40 for GUE–NGL, 50 for Greens–EFA, 23 for IND/DEM (resulting in its dissolution) and 29 NI.
Apportionment of seats.
At the previous election member states were granted a fixed allocation of seats for election as determined under the provisions of the Treaty of Nice (current allocation is in the 2007 column below). The admission of Bulgaria and Romania midway through the previous Parliament's term had increased the overall size of the assembly to 785, and under the terms of the Treaty of Nice it was mandated that the seat allocations be modified for this election, dropping 49 seats to keep the overall size of the Parliament down.
It had been the stated desire of the member-state governments to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon before the election so that its articles governing the European Parliament could enter force as of this election. However, this was blocked by the Irish rejection of the treaty in a referendum. Under Lisbon, there would be a somewhat different allocation of seats, with fewer seats eliminated, leading to a slightly different distribution totalling 751 MEPs. If the Lisbon Treaty is subsequently ratified, it is planned to give the additional seats to the "increasing" countries already before the next elections, bringing the number of MEPs to 754 for a transitional period until 2014.
To have the additional MEPs ready at hand, 18 "phantom MEPs" were supposed to be elected at the election (which, however, did not happen in France). These were expected to get observer status in the European Parliament and full payment from the day the Lisbon Treaty enters into force (which did not happen either), but only become full members of parliament after an additional protocol is ratified. The latter will require a decision by the European Council.

Campaign.
Many of the national parties running in the election are affiliated to transnational pan-European political parties known as political parties at European level. Those pan-European parties are EPP, PES, ELDR, EFA, European Greens, AEN, PEL, EDP and EUD. The question of which was the first to campaign transnationally is the subject of some debate, with the European Greens stating that they were the first in 2004.
New parties that aspire to pan-European status during the 2009 elections include Newropeans, Europe United, Europe – Democracy – Esperanto and Libertas Party Limited. The role for pan-European political parties has been expanded by changes enacted by the European Commission in 2007 under the direction of Margot Wallström.
Four incumbent European Commissioners will run as candidates in the election: Viviane Reding (Luxembourg, information society & media, Christian Social People's Party/EPP), Louis Michel (Belgium, development & humanitarian aid, Reformist Movement/ELDR), Danuta Hübner (Poland, regional policy, Civic Platform/EPP), Meglena Kuneva (Bulgaria, consumer protection, National Movement for Stability and Progress/ELDR). Ján Figeľ (Slovakia, education, training & culture, Christian Democratic Movement/EPP) was tipped to but ultimately did not run. He is bound to become the new chairman of his party instead.
Kuneva later decided not to take up her seat in the European Parliament.
Issue-based campaigns.
These divide into EU-wide and nationally based campaigns, often by non-governmental organisations focussed on specific policy areas. They are designed to influence MEP candidates, those with a strong interest in the issue, and voters in general. Examples of nationally based campaigns include those of the Royal College of Nursing and British Overseas NGOs for Development.
Media coverage.
The European Parliament, National broadcasters, the EBU, with the cooperation of the Communication Commissioner, Margot Wallström, are jointly working to make the 2009 election more interesting to the public and increase turnout. Previously, diverse news media in the European Union, and the fact that the election takes place over several days, have made it hard to attract viewers. The media consortium is hoping to focus the 2009 election more towards the EU level and the European Parliament itself, hoping to make the election more interesting and cosmetically appealing for television viewers. Members of the European Parliament (MEP) also started initiatives in late 2007 to make the election more interesting to voters in a bid to increase turnout.
From 1 April Parliament started putting up election posters, internet banners and billboards encouraging people to vote, with messages such as "How much should we tame financial markets?" to demonstrate the role of Parliament. The same 10 posters, designed by Berlin-based advertising company Scholz & Friends Group, were translated into all 23 languages and have been deployed across the whole of the EU. However, some posters are put up more in countries where the issues they present are of more significance and the most posters will be put up in those countries which had the lowest turnout in 2004. The end slogan is "Use your vote in the European Parliament Elections" with the date of the election in that country. The entire campaign costs 18 million euros, or 0.05 euros per eligible voter, with Germany, Spain and Italy donating some advertising space free of charge.
Role of the Treaty of Lisbon.
It had initially been foreseen that the Treaty of Lisbon would have entered into force by the time of these elections, making them the first to be held under its provisions. However, primarily because of the No vote in the referendum in Ireland, the framework established by the Treaty of Nice will be used again. Amongst other differences, the number of MEPs to be returned depends upon which rules are in effect: while 736 MEPs will be elected under the Nice rules, this number would have increased to 751 if the Lisbon Treaty were in force.
A further change that Lisbon would have brought was an increase to the powers of Parliament, including powers over the appointment of the President of the European Commission. It had been suggested by some that political parties could run with candidates for the Commission President; with leaders now linking the post to elections and that convention having been enshrined in the Constitution, further encouraging the possibility.
In 2007, it emerged that current Commission President José Manuel Barroso would likely seek a second term, which he confirmed on 19 July 2008, and he received the backing of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In beginning to formalise the emerging party-political nature of the office, in early 2009 the centre-right People's Party backed Barroso as their candidate and the centre-left socialists opposed, however they did not put forward their own formal candidate.
Results.
The national results as of 8 June 2009 are as follows. (based on predictions, to be confirmed)
Full members.
736 members with full voting rights (the groups used are the groups they had been associated with directly prior to the elections):
NB: "Adjusted" figures restate group numbers to proportionately reflect the reduction of the Parliament's size by 49, and to reflect the following political group movements announced prior to the election: DIKO (CY) from ALDE to Other; ODS (CZ) from EPP to Other; FF (IE) from UEN to ALDE; AN (IT) from UEN to EPP; PD (IT) from PES and ALDE to Other; PiS (PL) from UEN to Other; and Conservatives/UCUNF (UK) from EPP to Other.
Note:Postal votes missing from Slovenia. Complete results were supposed to be announced on 15 June
Observers.
18 additional seats were designated to be filled by "observers" when the Lisbon treaty goes into force, to account for new seat distribution with the Lisbon Treaty. On 23 June an intergovernmental conference (IGC) of EU member states amended a protocol attached to the Lisbon treaty on transitional arrangements. Those transitional arrangements were originally envisaged as taking the total number of MEPs from 785 to 751 for the 2009 elections. The amended text says that the protocol “shall enter into force if possible on 1 December 2010”. Germany is allowed to retain its three additional MEPs until the next elections in 2014.
The member states entitled to observer seats were supposed to make provisions before the 2009 elections for who would get the additional seats in the European Parliament. However, this was not done by France. This created a limbo for the observers elected from other countries, since all observers are supposed to start their work at the same time. In December 2011, they took their seats.
The following is a list of all observer seats
Note that this table already includes the grouping changes announced by the parties and reflected in the section below.
Group changes.
Traditionally, realignment between the different political groups and European political parties occurs in the runup to the election and in the time between the election and the first sitting of the European Parliament, when the political groups are constituted; the first sitting of the EP elected in 2009 is set for 14 July 2009.
New rules regarding the minimum number of members needed for a political group will come into effect following the 2009 election. The PES and EPP–ED had initially proposed to raise the limit for groups in the EP from 20 MEPs and one fifth of member states to 30 MEPs and a quarter of member states, which would effectively close down UEN (only MEPs from six countries) and I/D (only 22 MEPs). All five smaller groups (UEN and I/D plus ALDE, Greens–EFA and GUE–NGL) protested against these proposed changes. The proposal was voted down 15 to 14 in committee, and in an eventual compromise, new rules were approved in plenary on 9 July 2008 which require 25 MEPs from at least a quarter of the member states (i.e. seven member states). Although UEN and I/D still fail to meet the basic requirements of the new rules, the adopted compromise also included a provision allowing the continued existence of a group which had fallen below the threshold, but only if it still had members from at least a fifth of the member states and only if it had been founded at least a year before dropping below the threshold; if there is "sufficient evidence" of the abuse of this provision, it need not be applied.
Union for Europe of the Nations.
The Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) was a parliamentary group which traced its ancestry back to its origins as a Gaullist ideological alignment. It was not reconstituted following this election. The associated Alliance for Europe of the Nations (AEN) party lost MEPs to other groupings.
The largest single contributor of MEPs to the UEN group, the Italian National Alliance, merged with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to form the People of Freedom (PdL) in 29 March 2009. The combined party belonged to the EPP and the MEPs elected in 2009 sat in that parliamentary grouping. This move came after a series of attempts by National Alliance to abandon more staunchly national conservatism and Eurosceptic parties and move towards the moderate European centre-right, including a previous application for EPP membership.
Ireland's Fianna Fáil joined the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) in 16 April 2009. Fianna Fáil has long been a proponent of European integration and was openly uncomfortable about its European affiliation, with former leader Bertie Ahern often distancing his party from the right-wing positions of his groupmates and describing UEN as purely a "technical arrangement." Fianna Fáil very nearly joined ALDE during the group reshuffle after the 2004 European elections, and had also previously explored seeking membership in ELDR.
Other significant sources of the group's MEPs were Poland's Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland party and Latvia's For Fatherland and Freedom party subsequently joined the European Conservatives and Reformists group.
European Democrats.
The European Democrats group, which had previously sat with the European People's Party's parliament group was dissolved after the election. The group's three political parties: the United Kingdom's Conservatives and Ulster Unionists and the Czech Civic Democrats, left to found the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists. The group's only other MEP, an Italian from the Pensioners' Party, failed to win reelection.
Socialist Party.
The Italian Democratic Party was founded in 2007 from two parties in the Olive coalition decided to merge: Democrats of the Left and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy a socialist and a liberal party respectively. The merged resulted in disagreements over which European political party the Democratic Party would belong to, with many former members of the Daisy party objection to member of the Party of European Socialists (PES). Eventually it was agreed that the party would sit with the PES in the European Parliament but not join the party. The new parliamentary grouping was originally going to be called the "Alliance of Socialists and Democrats for Europe", but this name was too similar to the name of the liberal group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, so the name was changed to Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).
The Democratic Party (DIKO) of Cyprus, which had previously sat with Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe joined the S&D after the 2009 elections but remained outside of a pan-European political party.

The two largest groups in Parliament, the EPP-ED and PES, agreed to share the post of President of the European Parliament as they have done for all but two terms of Parliament. The first half of the term was taken by Jerzy Buzek MEP of the EPP, who was the first MEP from Eastern Europe to hold the post. He passed it over to Martin Schulz MEP, the current leader of PES. The deal got support form The ALDE group (their candidate Graham Watson dropped out from the race).
The other official candidate was Eva-Britt Svensson, nominated from EUL-NGL. She campaigned with the slogan "a different voice". She was the first MEP from Sweden to candidate to the position.

Donna Nelson

Dr. Donna J. Nelson is a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma. Nelson specializes in organic chemistry, which she both researches and teaches. Nelson's career has focused on five primary areas of research generally categorized in two areas, "Scientific Research" and "America's Scientific Readiness". Within Scientific Research, Nelson's areas have been: (1) mechanistic patterns in alkene addition reactions and (2) Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) functionalization and analysis. Under America's Scientific Readiness, she focuses on (3) science education, which includes classroom innovations and correcting organic chemistry textbook inaccuracies, (4) ethnic and gender diversity among highly-ranked science departments of research universities, and (5) improving the presentation of science and images of scientists to the public, such as serving as a science advisor to the AMC television show "Breaking Bad."
Education and Career Milestones.
Nelson was born in Eufaula, Oklahoma. She earned her bachelor of science degree in chemistry at the University of Oklahoma. She then obtained her PhD in chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin with Michael J. S. Dewar and did post-doctorate work at Purdue University with 1979 Chemistry Nobel Laureate Herbert C. Brown. After her post-doctorate studies at Purdue, Nelson joined the University of Oklahoma as a faculty member. She was a Faculty Fellow in the University of Oklahoma Provost’s Office from 1989 to 1990. Nelson was a Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003 and in 2010. She was an assistant to American Chemical Society President Ann Nalley from Nalley's election in 2004 through 2007.
Scientific Research.
Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) Reactions
In 2005, Nelson began applying to Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) reactions the knowledge gained from her earlier research on the effects of substituents upon reactions of alkenes. She applied nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to examine the effects of substituents upon SWCNT reaction and association with a variety of classes of organic molecules, such as alcohols, amines, ketones, aldehdes, and nitro compounds. By doing this, she pioneered the application of NMR to functionalized and pristine SWCNT characterization and analysis.
Reactions of Alkenes
As a physical organic chemist, Nelson developed a new synthetically useful technique for gathering mechanistic information on addition reactions of alkenes. The investigations often permitted selection of one mechanism from several which are proposed. The technique has helped determine mechanisms of important addition reactions of alkenes, such as hydroboration, oxymercuration, bromination, the Wacker process, and the Wilkinson's catalyst reaction.
America's Scientific Readiness.
Science Education.
Improving Organic Chemistry Textbooks.
In 2011, Nelson examined comprehensive undergraduate organic chemistry textbooks in use at that time, in order to determine consistency in cyclohexane conformation across the texts and with research literature; they recommended changes to remedy inconsistencies in cyclohexane conformer nomenclature and structural drawings across the textbooks. She and her students continue to evaluate currently-used undergraduate organic chemistry textbooks in order to identify other content at odds with research literature and characteristics which are most conducive to learning.
Classroom Innovations.
Nelson utilized her teaching assignment of large sections of organic chemistry to develop and evaluate learning devices for her students. The devices use a visual, rather than oral or written, presentation; two were adopted by publishers to accompany their major organic chemistry textbooks. She also surveyed students in order to determine factors which influence students to select or remain in science majors. Nelson's research results and materials from an education project, designed by Oklahoma high school students and involving precipitate-forming reactions conducted in microgravity on board the STS-40, are the subject of a permanent educational exhibit demonstrating the scientific method, at the Oklahoma Air and Space Museum.
Research on Diversity in Science.
From FY2001 to FY2004, Nelson surveyed tenured and tenure-track university faculty members of the "top 50" departments in each of 14 science and engineering disciplines (chemistry, physics, mathematics, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, political science, sociology, economics, biological sciences, and psychology). Data were collected about race/ethnicity, gender, and rank, and are complete populations, rather than samples, so they accurately reveal the small number or complete absence of underrepresented groups. Data for all disciplines were obtained simultaneously and by a consistent protocol and are therefore comparable across a large number of disciplines. These became known as the Nelson Diversity Surveys.
That first study revealed that generally, women and minorities are significantly underrepresented on these faculties. For example, the first survey, completed in FY2002, showed that there were no black, Hispanic, or Native American tenured or tenure track women faculty in the top 50 computer science departments. For chemistry and chemical engineering faculties, her additional national origin data revealed that, recently, more immigrants have been hired as faculty than American females and American minorities combined. Analogous surveys were carried out for top 100 departments in each of 15 science and engineering disciplines, including earth science, in FY2005 and in FY2007.
Nelson's diversity research has been cited by dozens of newspapers, magazines, and journals, including "Nature", "The New York Times", "The Christian Science Monitor", and CNN. The Government Accountability Office used Nelson's data for its July 2004 report to Congress on Title IX, specifically women's access to opportunities in the sciences. Nelson has also written about diversity in the STEM fields for outlets, such as PBS and the Association for Women in Science.
Image of Science and Scientists in Society.
Science Advisor to AMC TV Series "Breaking Bad.
Nelson is a proponent of scientific accuracy in television, film, and other moving media, as well as promoting the intersections of scientific communities and the public. She is one of the science advisers for the AMC TV series, Breaking Bad. After a plea for scientific help from the show's creator, Vince Gilligan, Nelson volunteered to advise the show in regards to organic chemistry. Dr. Nelson checked scripts and provided dialogue for the television show Breaking Bad. She also drew chemical structures and wrote chemical equations which were used as props. According to executive producer/creator Vince Gilligan, "Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-god chemists. We have a [chemist named Dr. Donna Nelson at the University of Oklahoma who is very helpful to us and vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Association based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us." 
During a set visit in Albuquerque on May 12, she was filmed for a cameo appearance as a nursing home attendant, but the scene was cut.
Hollywood Chemistry" Symposia.
In order to span the science and entertainment communities, she organized a "Hollywood Chemistry" symposium at the March 2011 ACS National Meeting at Anaheim, CA. The symposium was so well-received that she was asked to organize a second symposium for the August 2011 ACS National Meeting at Denver, CO, "Science on the Hollywood Screen."
Big Bang Theory, Ig Nobel Award, and Other Contributions.
She participated in the "Geek of the Week" program of David Saltzberg, by visiting the set of The Big Bang Theory in March 2013 and again in March 2014.
In the 2011 Ig Nobel Awards, she gave a 24/7 presentation on her SWCNT research, in which she gave a technical talk appropriate for scientists to describe the work in 24 seconds, followed by 7 words which would clarify the work to all laypeople. The seven words were "SWCNT analyses should be shaken, not stored." She gave advice on background, terminology, pronunciation, and the retrosynthesis and total synthesis of haplophytine to writers and actors in the first stage production of Triangle at the Lyric Theatre.
Native Americans and Diabetes.
She collaborated with Native American tribes to determine incidences in, effects of, and attitudes toward diabetes in Oklahoma Native Americans.
Awards and Honors.
Nelson has received a number of honors and awards. These include being named American Chemical Society (ACS) Fellow (2010), Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame, (2013) ACS Oklahoma Chemist of the Year (2012), Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century (2006), American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS Fellow (2005), and Minority Health Professions Foundation Hall of Fame Inductee (2005). She has also received the ACS Nalley Award (2011), ACS Israel Award (2011), a Guggenheim Fellowship (2003), a National Organization for Women “Woman of Courage” Award (2004), a Ford Foundation Fellowship (2003), a Fulbright Scholarship (2007), a SACNAS Distinguished Scientist Award (2006), a National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE Leadership Award (2006), Oklahoma Outstanding Professor Award (2005), Sigma Xi Faculty Research Award (2001), and NSF Special Creativity Extension (1989).
Nelson has written more than 100 peer-reviewed publications, and has given hundreds of invited presentations to national meetings of professional societies and organizations, universities, and radio and TV programs, such as "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" and "Marketplace Morning Report". The "Journal of Organic Chemistry" cover of February 4, 2005, and the ACS's Division of Organic Chemistry Calendar cover of September, 2006, each featured her research. The Chemical Heritage Foundation (2009), Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (2004), and JustGarciaHill (2003) each collected her history to add to their collections of prominent scientist biographies.

Cheri Gaulke

Cheri Gaulke (born 1954) is a visual artist most known for her role in the Feminist Art Movement in southern California in the 1970s and her current work on gay and lesbian families. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Minneapolis College of Art and Design and a Master of Arts degree (in Feminist Art/Education) from Goddard College.
In 1975, Gaulke moved to Los Angeles and became involved with the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building. At the Feminist Studio Workshop, Gaulke studied with Suzanne Lacy and focused primarily on performance art. There she created a character she called Cinderella, who Gaulke describes as not conforming to any specific sex or gender role and thus "in a constant state of transformation." In addition to her solo work, Gaulke collaborated with Anne Gauldin to produce The Malta Project, in which the two performed rites related to female spirituality at prehistoric temples throughout Malta. Gaulke has been a co-founder of two collaborative feminist performance groups: Feminist Art Workers (1976–81), co-founded with Nancy Angelo, Candace Compton, Vanalyne Green, and Laurel Klick, and Sisters of Survival (SOS), co-founded in 1981 with Nancy Angelo, Jerri Allyn, Anne Gauldin, and Sue Maberry.
Though Gaulke has moved away from performance, the feminist art strategies that she helped to innovate in the 1970s in southern California continue in her work. Her art continues to be a vehicle for social commentary and as a way to tell the stories of individuals and groups under-represented in society. She works in a variety of media, but mostly video, installation art, artists' books, and public art. Such projects have included a video in collaboration with lesbian and gay teens, a photographic wall installation about lesbian and gay families, a video installation with Latino teenagers about the L.A. River, and a video installation about kids’ perspectives on a river in North Carolina. Gaulke has completed three public art projects—a Metro-Rail Station in Los Angeles that tells stories about an oft-ignored urban river, an outdoor sculptural piece for a library in Lake View Terrace, and three stainless steel and glass glowing “Pillars of Community” for the City of Lakewood, California.
In 1991 Gaulke was an Artist Book Resident at Women's Studio Workshop in Rosendale, NY. While a resident, Gaulke published "Impedement", a handmade artist's book that investigates the abuse of women’s footwear and feet through the ages, from the ancient Chinese foot binding to high heeled shoes of the present. Personal and historical narratives illustrate the results of cultures’ persisting foot fetish. Nested within the book is a pop-up which presents the reader with a packet of “seeds” for change. "Impedement" was published as an edition of 200.
Gaulke has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, and the Brody Arts Fund. She has exhibited her work in numerous formats all over the world, including exhibitions at the Los Angeles Art Association (LAAA) and Museum of Modern Art as well as on buses and in churches.
In 1986 she received the Vesta Award from the Los Angeles Woman's Building for Contributions to Performance art, and she was honored with a mid-career fellowship from the Cultural Affairs Department (COLA grant) in 2004-05. In 2013, she received the Art as a Hammer Award from the Center for the Study of Political Graphics.

Providence St. Mel School

Providence St. Mel School (PSM) is a private, coeducational P-12 school in East Garfield Park, Chicago, Illinois. The school currently has 594 students and 50 teachers.
History.
The school was created in 1969 with the merger of two schools, Providence High School and St. Mel High School. In 1978 the Archdiocese of Chicago tried to close down the school by withdrawing its support. The administrators of the school and community members were determined to operate the school on its own, without the support of the Archdiocese, so principal Paul J. Adams met with Sister Loretta Schafer, general superior of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The Sisters had founded Providence High School in the 1930s under Mother Mary Raphael Slattery and still owned the Providence-St. Mel property, which Schafer transferred to Adams free of charge. In the fall of 1978, Providence St. Mel reopened as a private independent school. A middle school was added in 1983 and in 1987 and 1993 elementary school grades were added.
When the Archdiocese of Chicago moved to close the last Catholic high school on the West Side in 1978, the principal, parents and students of Providence-St. Mel came together to help maintain the school.
During the spring of 1978, they fought back. Principal Paul J. Adams III embarked on a fight that would cement his place in history as one of America’s modern-day freedom fighters.
“The School That Wouldn’t Die” was born and the nation would soon know about Providence St. Mel, its trials and its remarkable success rate. Numerous articles would be written and stories told about a school, a man and his students. The 1970s movie "Cooley High" was filmed there.
Today, Providence St. Mel is home to more than 600 students from all walks of life. Since 1978, 100 percent of its seniors have been accepted to college.
In 1982 and 1983, President Ronald Reagan visited Providence St. Mel School to acknowledge its noteworthy achievements. In 1993, Oprah Winfrey donated $1,000,000 to Providence-St. Mel. 
A charter school was added in Chicago's Englewood community area during Fall 2006 and is known as Providence Englewood. It currently houses grades 1-5 and plans to add higher levels soon.
The October 2006 issue of Chicago magazine, ranked Providence St. Mel as one of the most outstanding elementary schools in the metropolitan Area. Providence-St. Mel earned a place on the Chicago magazine "A+ Team," the list of select 115 public and 25 private elementary and middle schools.

<doc id="5967040" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967040" title="Socialist Youth League (United States)">
Socialist Youth League (United States)

The Socialist Youth League was the youth group affiliated with the Workers Party, a splinter Trotskyist party led by Max Shachtman. The parent group changed its name to the Independent Socialist League in 1950. In February 1954, the Socialist Youth League merged with the faction of the Young People's Socialist League and changed its name to Young Socialist League. The YSL merged with a later incarnation of the YPSL in August 1958, around the same time that the ISL was merging into that group's parent body the Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.
History.
The SYL was established in 1946, just after World War II ended. During the war the Workers Party had concentrated mostly on colonizing basic industries and organizing wildcat strikes, but after the war ended this strategy foundered, as the expected post-war wave of labor radicalism failed to materialize. The groups press began to concentrate more on campus activism in the late 1940s. and 1950s. By the early 1950s the SYL represented one of the few viable left-wing groups on Americas campuses. The other organizations that had briefly become popular on campus in the late 1940s - Young Progressives of America, American Veterans Committee, Labor Youth League - had all been discredited as either Communist Party USA or Communist Party USA influenced. The SYL filled this void and became the most visible Leftists group on campus. 
In contrast to the low brow style of the CPUSA, the Shachtmanites attempted appeal to intellectuals and "elite culture". The SYL catered to a Bohemian milieu, the beginnings of the Beat movement. Writers like Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti would frequent SYL and YSL meetings. In one instance, while Shachtman was delivering a lecture on Dadaism a disgruntled Dadaist threw a bowl of potato salad at him, an event commemorated in Ginsberg's "Howl".
The SYL made attempts to infiltrate and take over other groups in the 1940s and 1950s. It was most successful within the YPSL. The SYL recruited Michael Harrington and Bogdan Denitch within the YPSL, partially on the basis of their opposition to the Korean War, which the Socialist Party supported. In 1954, as noted above, they were able to merge the YPSL with the SYL to form the Young Socialist League. (The Socialist Party subsequently reformed the YPSL.) The new organization had a total of 83 members. Nevertheless it was still one of the most visible leftist groups on campus in the mid-1950s. They also attempted infiltration of the Student League for Industrial Democracy where they organized a "Red Caucus" which took over the CCNY Evening Session chapter and attempted to steer the group in a more "disciplined" direction. After a two year upheaval which strained the resources of the SLID they were eventually kicked out. In 1955 they succeeded in taking over the New York regional office of Students for Democratic Action, an affiliate of Americans for Democratic Action. They were only prevented from capturing the national organization when the ADA threatened to cut off the group's funding.
Meanwhile, the ISL was making overtures to merge with the Socialist Party, which itself had merged with the Social Democratic Federation to form the Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation in January 1956. Proponents of the merger in both groups cited the youth groups as an important selling point. The revived YPSL had fewer than 100 members, while the YSL, by the late 1950s, had three times as many. A merger would give the party an appreciable youth section for the first time in a decade. While the merger was hotly debated at the SP-SDFs convention in May 30 -June 1, 1958 and then voted upon by the membership that summer, the YPSL and YSL merged in convention in late August. The ISL itself however was dissolved, its properties bequeathed to the SP-SDF and its members requested to join as individuals.
At the time of its dissolution the Young Socialist League had approximately 250 members in 15 chapters, including at Columbia, Oberlin, Antioch, Boston University and the University of Washington. A left group within the YSL, consisting of about a quarter of its membership led by Tim Wohlforth rejected the merger and went into the Socialist Workers Party affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance, where they would eventually form the germ of the Revolutionary Tendency and, from that, the Spartacist League.
It published the magazine "Anvil", in which Hal Draper was to publish an early version of his pamphlet The Two Souls of Socialism in 1960.

Columbus Circle (Syracuse, New York)

Columbus Circle is a neighborhood and plaza in the downtown section of Syracuse, New York. Columbus Monument was designed by the Syracuse-born architect, Dwight James Baum in 1895. Columbus Circle is home to Syracuse's two cathedrals, the Episcopalian St. Paul's Cathedral and the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. As well as County Court House and the County's John H. Mulroy Civic Center, home of the Onondaga County Government.
History.
The small park was originally a traffic circle surrounded by Victorian era homes. Columbus Circle was first known as Library Circle (1895) and later as St. Mary's Circle (1901). It was designed in 1895 by Dwight James Baum and is located at Onondaga Avenue, East Jefferson Street and Montgomery Street in Syracuse, New York.
Columbus statue.
Over the years, many properties that bordered the circle were razed and a new courthouse and library were constructed. The traffic circle underwent several design changes, the most significant, in 1934, when the statue of Christopher Columbus and associated fountain were erected. At that time, the circle was paved over which closed the area to through traffic. 
The new features were added by laborers during the Depression-era Works Progress Administration (WPA) program and completed in May 1936. The new Columbus Park was dedicated soon after.
The statue, sculpted by Lorenzo Baldo, is surrounded by buildings designed by renowned architects such as Archimedes Russell, Melvin King, James Randall and Michael O'Connor. The circle is listed in both the "National Register" and "Local Preservation District".
Recent years.
Columbus Circle is host to many events including the annual "Arts & Crafts Festival".

SS Columbus (1924)

The Columbus, laid down before the start of World War I, was originally to be named "Hindenburg". However, her then-sister, originally named "Columbus", was handed over to the White Star Line after the war as part of reparations in 1920. The Allies allowed the Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL), her owners, to keep the remaining ship. NDL decided to give her the name of her departed sister, now the British "Homeric". Construction, which had been held up by the war, resumed at Schichau Shipyards in Danzig, Germany.
Construction and maiden voyage.
Material shortages caused by the war delayed her completion until 1924. She made her maiden voyage in April of that year. At the time, she was the German merchant marine's largest, fastest ocean liner. She measured 32,354 gross tons, was long and carried 1,650 passengers: 400 in First Class, 600 in Second and 650 Third Class passengers. She was one of the first liners to have an outside swimming pool installed on her top deck, as well as a platform for night-time dancing. She had triple-expansion steam engines which drove her at a rather modest 18 knots. Nevertheless she was quite popular and convinced NDL that larger passenger liners were feasible.
Later career.
With the building of the "Bremen" and "Europa", the "Columbus" was supplanted as the queen of the NDL fleet. In 1928, she was given a refit to make her resemble her younger, larger and faster running mates. This included the addition of two larger smokestacks and replacement of the reciprocating engines with geared turbines, increasing her speed from 18 knots to 20 knots. She spent the winter months cruising the Caribbean.
At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, "Columbus" was on one of these cruises when she was ordered to return to Germany at once. The Royal Navy was on the lookout for enemy ships. Putting her passengers ashore at Havana, Cuba, her captain and crew spent two months evading the British by taking refuge in several South American ports.
On 19 December the British destroyer HMS "Hyperion" sighted "Columbus" about 400 miles off the coast of Virginia. The still neutral American heavy cruiser "Tuscaloosa" was also in the area, and silently observed the two ships. Rather than surrender the ship, her crew scuttled her, and she burned and sank. Her passengers and crew, 567 men and nine women, were taken aboard "Tuscaloosa" as rescued seamen, not as prisoners of war as they would have been had the British picked them up. "Tuscaloosa" took all personnel to New York City. After the end of war many returned to Germany.

Killer Shrike

Killer Shrike is the name of two fictional characters in Marvel Comics.
Publication history.
He first appeared in "Rampaging Hulk" #1 (January 1977) and was created by John Warner and John Buscema.
Fictional character biography.
Simon Maddicks.
Simon Maddicks was born in Williamsburg, Virginia. He began his career as a soldier in the United States Army. However, after that, not even Maddicks recalls much about his own past for some reason. When he was selected to be a special agent of the Roxxon Oil Company, Maddicks became a mercenary and professional criminal, more specifically a special agent in covert operations. He was sent to the Mutagenics Laboratory of the Brand Corporation, where he underwent extensive conditioning which increased his human abilities. He also underwent surgery which implanted a miniature anti-gravity generator in his spine. Roxxon later gave Maddicks his super-villain costume and the codename "Killer Shrike".
For his first mission, Roxxon sent him to infiltrate the subversive organization called the Conspiracy, which Roxxon learned about through major purchases of technology from the Brand Corporation. The Conspiracy sent Killer Shrike to capture a monster known as Goram. Unfortunately for Killer Shrike, the plan was thwarted by the super-hero known as Ulysses Bloodstone who short-circuited the villain's electrical weapons, badly injuring him. Feeling sorry for Killer Shrike's condition, Bloodstone's agents sent the villain to a New York hospital, where he lay comatose for several weeks.
Upon awakening from the coma, Maddicks was contacted once again by Brand scientists, led by Dr. Stephen Weems. Weems, better known as the villain Modular Man, sought revenge against his enemies Spider-Man and Beast. In return, the Modular Man promised Shrike information about his past. In battle with Spider-Man and the Beast, Weems was killed before he could uphold his end of the bargain. Shrike escaped and was soon contacted by agents of the Brand Corporation. They helped restore his memory, and assigned him to undercover work as bodyguard to Brand president James Melvin. His costume became controlled by the Will-o'-the-Wisp, and he was forced to abduct Dr. Marla Madison to reconstitute the immaterial Wisp. In the end, he was defeated by Spider-Man. With Brand's public dissolution, Killer Shrike became a free agent.
With other superhuman adventurers and criminals, Killer Shrike was later captured and imprisoned by the Locksmith. He was freed by Spider-Woman. He later robbed a bank, but was defeated by Spider-Man. He then attempted a theft of a power booster from the Tinkerer after commissioning him to build it for him, but was again defeated both by Spider-Man and a failsafe function the Tinkerer installs in his products to deal with such situations.
During the events of the "Acts of Vengeance", Killer Shrike attacked Moon Knight, alongside the second Ringer and Coachwhip. He shot down the Mooncopter, seriously injuring Moon Knight's pilot Frenchie and then escaped. Killer Shrike was later hired by Surge, and battled the She-Hulk alongside Grey Gargoyle and Dragon Man but was defeated. 
Ever since, Killer Shrike was most often seen getting beaten up by several super-heroes, most often the Hulk. Killer Shrike was briefly a member of the Cardinal's team of flying super villains known as Air Force. Killer Shrike was oddly absent when the team was blackmailed by Night Thrasher into providing relief for Rwandan refugees. In "New Warriors" #54 Killer Shrike appears to have been murdered by the Soldiers of Misfortune. This was probably an art error as Oriole not Killer Shrike was with the team when blackmailed by Night Thrasher.
In the Secret War miniseries, Killer Shrike's powers got updated by the Tinkerer. Unfortunately, this still was not enough for Maddicks to gain a victory, as he was soon afterward defeated by the Avengers, and apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D..
Killer Shrike was later apprehended by Baron Zemo and forced to join the Thunderbolts, for so far unclear reasons.
Killer Shrike later made a cameo at the Bar With No Name.
Killer Shrike was beat up by Moon Knight and attacked in the hospital by the Black Spectre.
Killer Shrike later appeared as a member of the Shadow Council's Masters of Evil. Killer Shrike is present when Max Fury and the Masters of Evil capture John Steele after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the Serpent Crown and the Crown of Thorns.
Killer Shrike II.
After Killer Shrike sold his original costume to Roderick Kingsley, Kingsley sold the costume to an unnamed criminal. Killer Shrike was present with Hobgoblin (who was actually Roderick Kingsley's butler Claude) when he led his forces into battle against the Goblin King's Goblin Underground. After Hobgoblin was killed by Goblin King, Killer Shrike was among the villains that defected to the Goblin Underground.
Following Spider-Man's victory over the Goblin King, Killer Shrike was seen with the former Hobgoblin henchmen at the Bar with No Name where they encounter Electro.
Powers and abilities.
Extensive conditioning and surgery by Brand Corporation scientists enhanced Simon Maddicks's strength and other physical abilities. He is capable of flight by means of a surgically implanted anti-gravity generator at the base of his spine, activated by a neural link. Besides that, he has extensive training and experience in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, and proficiency with hand weapons including guns and knives. Killer Shrike wears body armor, an armored suit made of an insulated steel alloy mesh capable of protecting him from flight turbulence and small caliber weapons fire. His major weapons system is the twin power-blasters worn on his wrists, with titanium talons capable of slashing flesh, wood, cinderblock, and light metals, and of discharging high-frequency electrical bolts.
Other versions.
Ultimate Marvel.
The Ultimate version of Killer Shrike made a cameo in "Ultimate Spider-Man" #72, trying to rob Roxxon Energy Corporation Industries of their supply of Adamantium - but was apprehended by Spider-Man. This version was a deranged, desperate man who seemed to almost froth at the mouth; Spider-Man himself referred to him as 'Steroid-Boy with a Laser Tag Fetish'. It was later revealed that he was an employee of the Ultimate Tinkerer hired specifically to bother Donald Roxxon as vengeance for firing him.

McDowell Grove Forest Preserve

McDowell Grove Forest Preserve, located in Naperville, state of Illinois, is a preserve on the West Branch of the DuPage River.
The Preserve was used as a work camp for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) from 1933 to 1938 and during this time, many projects were accomplished, including dredging the McDowell's lagoon and building of a limestone dam on the West Branch. The camp had military style barracks for housing of the 3,800 men who lived and worked in the camp during the five-year period.
The Preserve was the site of a secret radar training school during World War II. Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army took over the old Civilian Conservation Corps camp located in McDowell Grove, just northwest of Naperville, to construct a camp for the training of radar technology, operation and maintenance.
The U.S. Army Signal Corps quietly recruited highly intelligent young men for the classified work with the promise of a commission and a draft deferral. Because the students wore civilian clothes, they were sometimes accused of being conscientious objectors by townsfolk who could not be told what took place within the secret compound.
McDowell Grove is now part of the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, which acquired the camp (Camp McDowell) in 1946 as open space and features hiking trails, picnic sites, fishing on the shores of Mud Lake and the West Branch of the Dupage River and boating which can let paddlers access the West Branch of the DuPage River near the Fawell Dam. They can reach the put-in and take-out sites via a gravel access road off Raymond Drive.

Epigonus telescopus

Epigonus telescopus, the black cardinal fish, is a species of deepwater cardinalfish found in most temperate oceans worldwide, at depths of between though mostly between . It can reach a length of TL though most specimens do not exceed TL. It has been reported that this species can reach an age of 104 years.
Description.
The black cardinal fish is a shallow-bodied fish with large eyes and a blunt snout and slightly projecting lower jaw. The dorsal fin is in two parts and has seven or eight spines and nine to eleven soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and nine soft rays. The general colour of this fish is purplish-brown or black and living specimens are iridescent.
Distribution and habitat.
The black cardinal fish is a deepwater bentho-pelagic fish that is found on continental slopes, undersea ridges and seamounts in the northern Atlantic, ranging from Iceland to the Canary Islands and the Corner Rise Seamounts. It is also found in the southeastern Atlantic, including the Walvis Ridge off southwestern Africa, the Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
Fisheries.
The black cardinal fish is subject to commercial fisheries, primarily around seamounts. Based on the FAO fishery statistics, the annual catches worldwide ranged between 1,355 and 4,353 tonnes in 2000 to 2009, most of the fish being taken from the Southwest Pacific (FAO Fishing Area 81).

History of the Jews in Finland

Finnish Jews are Jews who are citizens of Finland. The country is home to approximately 1,500 Jews, who mostly live in Helsinki. Jews came to Finland as traders and merchants from other parts of Europe.
History.
The first Jew said to have settled on Finnish soil was Jacob Weikam, later Veikkanen, in 1782, in the town of Hamina, which was at that point under Russian rule. During that time, most of Finland was included in the Kingdom of Sweden. In Sweden, Jews were allowed to reside in a few towns—all of them outside the territory that is now modern-day Finland. In 1809 Finland became part of the Russian Empire, as an autonomous Grand Duchy, but Swedish laws remained in force, meaning Jews were still unable to settle in Finnish territory.
Despite the legal difficulties, during the period of Finnish autonomy (1809–1917) Russian Jews established themselves in Finland as tradesmen and craftsmen. As Jews were in principle prohibited from dwelling in Finland, almost all these Jews were retired soldiers from the Imperial Russian army. Being cantonists, forced into the Russian army in childhood, they were required to serve at least 25 years. After their term expired, they had, however, the right to remain in Finland regardless of Finnish ban on Jewish settlement, a right forcefully defended by the Russian military authorities. It was only after Finland declared its independence, in 1917, that Jews were granted full rights as Finnish citizens.
World War II.
Finland's involvement in World War II began during the Winter War, the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland prior to Operation Barbarossa. A total of 204 Finnish Jews fought in the Finnish Army during the Winter War, of whom 27 were killed. Finnish Jews were among those made refugees after the Red Army conquered Karelia. Finnish national anger at the outcome of that war led to Finland's involvement in the Continuation War (1941–1944). While Germany launched Barbarossa, Finland simultaneously resumed hostilities against the Soviet Union. This resulted in democratically-ruled Finland fighting alongside Nazi Germany. Because Finland was not a totalitarian state dominated by the Nazi party, Finnish Jews were not subject to the mass persecution and genocide of the rest of Europe. As Finland was never invaded by Germany, Finland's Jews did not meet the same fate as Jews in Russia, where the genocide was perpetrated by or under the cover of the occupying Wehrmacht. Approximately 300 Finnish Jews fought in the Continuation War. As Finland's forces had substantial German Army forces supporting their operations, the Finnish front was almost certainly unique in having a field synagogue operating in the presence of Nazi troops.
Approximately 500 Jewish refugees arrived in Finland, although about 350 moved on to other countries. About 40 of the remaining Jewish refugees were sent for work service in Salla in Lapland in March 1942. The refugees were moved to Kemijärvi in June and eventually to Suursaari Island in the Gulf of Finland. It was believed that there they would not be able to have easy contact with influential Finnish Jews .
In November 1942, eight foreign Jewish refugees were handed over to Nazi Germany, a fact for which Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen issued an official apology in 2000. According to author Martin Gilbert, these eight consisted of Georg Kollman; Frans Olof Kollman; Frans Kollman's mother; Hans Eduard Szubilski; Henrich Huppert; Kurt Huppert; Hans Robert Martin Korn, who had been a volunteer in the Winter War; and an unknown individual. No further foreign Jewish refugees were deported from Finland after protests by Lutheran ministers, the Archbishop, and the Social Democratic Party.
Also around 1942, an exchange of Soviet POWs took place between Finland and Germany. Approximately 2,600–2,800 Soviet prisoners of war of various nationalities then held by Finland were exchanged for 2,100 Soviet POWs of Finnic nationalities (Finnish, Karelian, Ingrian, or Estonian) held by Germany, who might have volunteered in the Finnish army. About 2000 of the POW handed over by Finland joined the Wehrmacht. Among the rest there were about 500 people (mainly Soviet political officers) who were considered politically dangerous in Finland. This latter group most likely perished in concentration camps or were executed. Based on the a list of names, there were 47 Jews among the extradited, although they were not extradited based on religion.
Later in the war, Germany's ambassador to Helsinki Wipert von Blücher concluded in a report to Hitler that Finns would not endanger their citizens of Jewish origin in any situation. According to historian Henrik Meinander, this was realistically accepted by Hitler.
Yad Vashem records that 22 Finnish Jews died in the Holocaust, all fighting for the Finnish Army. Two Jewish officers of the Finnish army and one female Lotta Svärd member were awarded German Iron Crosses, but they refused to accept them.
Today.
During the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, about 28 Finnish Jews, mostly Finnish Army veterans, fought for the State of Israel. After Israel's establishment, Finland had a high rate of immigration to Israel (known as ""aliyah""), which depleted Finland's Jewish community. The community was somewhat revitalized when some Soviet Jews immigrated to Finland following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The number of Jews in Finland in 2010 was approximately 1,500, of whom 1,200 lived in Helsinki, about 200 in Turku, and about 50 in Tampere. The Jews are well integrated into Finnish society and are represented in nearly all sectors. Most Finnish Jews are corporate employees or self-employed professionals.
Most Finnish Jews speak Finnish or Swedish as their mother tongue. Yiddish, German, Russian, and Hebrew are also spoken in the community. The Jews, like Finland's other traditional minorities as well as immigrant groups, are represented on the Advisory Board for Ethnic Relations (ETNO).
There are two synagogues: one in Helsinki and one in Turku. Helsinki also has a Jewish day school, which serves about 110 students (many of them the children of Israelis working in Finland); and a Chabad Lubavitch rabbi is based there.
Antisemitism.
Historically, antisemitic hate crimes have been rare, and the Jewish community is relatively safe. However, there are have been a few antisemitic crimes reported in the last decade; the most common types include defamation, verbal threats, and damage to property.
In 2011, Ben Zyskowicz, the first Finnish-Jewish parliamentarian, was assaulted by a man shouting antisemitic slurs. In November 2012, a security officer in the Helsinki community said that six to ten antisemitic incidents were taking place every month, and advised Jews to avoid wearing their kippahs in public.
According to writer and Finnish resident Ben Sikorski, there is an increase in anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic bias in the country. Sikorski gave a number of examples in his interview with Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld in July 2013. The "Helsingin Sanomat", Finland's largest subscription newspaper, published a cartoon depicting a scene from 1943 of a German guard holding a bar of "Free Range Jew soap." Another example of anti-Semitism was journalist Kyösti Niemelä writing in the Helsinki University paper "Yliopisto" that a Holocaust denier could teach a university class on Jewish history. His argument was that even high school teachers can talk about controversial issues without revealing their ‘political opinions.’ He thus reduced Holocaust denial to a ‘political opinion.’” A third example of anti-Semitism was the Finnish hypermarket chain Prisma, with 64 stores nationwide, promoting the book "Jewish Domination" by racist American anti-Semitic politician David Duke. Also, Sikorski states that he witnessed Muslims giving the Nazi salute or shouting ""Allahu Akbar!"" ("Allah is great!") during pro-Israel rallies. In addition, according to The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism (CFCA), there were two more anti-Semitic incidents in Finland during 2013: A "Jew-list" was found at a neo-Nazi's house; and a group of youngsters passed the Jewish community of Helsinki, while one of them did the Nazi salute with his right hand.

Maratea

Maratea is a town and "comune" of Basilicata, in the province of Potenza. It is the only town of the region on the Tyrrhenian coast and because of its beautiful scenery and coastline it has been called "the Pearl of the Tyrrhenian". Owing to the considerable number of its churches and chapels it has also been described as "the town with 44 churches".
Geography.
Maratea is the only town of Basilicata on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It has approximately of rocky coastline, with more than twenty beaches. One of the main characteristics of Maratea is the variety of its landscapes, varying from breath-taking sea views to wooded hillsides and majestic mountains which sweep down to the sea creating steep cliffs.
The Grotta di Maratea, or the Cave of Wonders, was discovered in 1929 by men building the Highway 18 from Calabria.
The centre of the town (called "Maratea Borgo", meaning "Maratea's Old Town") is situated on the northern slopes of Mount San Biagio; other villages in the comune include Acquafredda, Cersuta, Fiumicello, Porto, Marina, Castrocucco (situated on the coast), Castello, Santa Caterina, Massa and Brefaro (situated on the overlooking hills). The principal vegetation comprises oaks, pines, rosemary, holm oaks, carob trees and wild fennel.
Maratea has a small harbour, which can accommodate up to 200 boats.
History.
Based on archeological findings, the first settlements in the Maratea region date back to the Paleolithic era. In the 15th–14th century BC a village grew up on top of the little headland called "La Timpa". This was a small trading center, and its existence is documented until 2nd century BC, when the Romans conquered Lucania.
During the Roman era, the region continued to be a trade center: on the seabed near "Santo Janni island" dozens of ancient anchors have been found, and these are now on display in the local museum.
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, southern Italy became part of the Byzantine Empire, starting from the Gothic Wars (6th century). From the 7th century, the Tyrrhenian Sea came under the control of the Saracens, (Sicily became a Muslim emirate in the 9th century), who sacked numerous towns. So, for safety reasons, the local inhabitants moved to the high ground of "Mount San Biagio", where they built the so-called "Castello", a little fortified urban centre.
In 732 a ship, fleeing the religious persecution of Leo III the Isaurian, brought the sacred remains of Saint Blaise to Maratea, who thereafter became the patron saint of the town. The remains of the saint are still kept in the Maratea's Basilica, which is built over an ancient temple of Minerva.
In 1077 Maratea, together with the rest of Southern Italy, was conquered by the Normans.
In the 11th-12th century, since the "Castello" could no longer accommodate the increasing population, some of the people of Maratea decided to found a new urban centre, historically called the "Borgo" (a word that means "village" in Italian). Today the ancient "Borgo" is the principal urban centre of Maratea. In view of the risk from Saracen attacks, the "Borgo" was situated behind Mount San Biagio, so that it could not be seen from the sea.
In 1282 the War of the Sicilian Vespers began, in which the houses of Angevins and Aragon fought for control of the Kingdom of Naples. The war ended in 1302, but the dispute continued for another century. Between 1302 and 1496, thanks to its loyalty to the royal house, Maratea was awarded numerous grants of autonomy. The "Castello" was put under siege in 1441, by Lauria (a nearby town), and in 1495 by Angevins soldiers. On both occasion it resisted successfully.
From 1566 to 1595, six guardhouse-towers were built along the coastline, to protect the new villages that had developed in the meantime: "Acquafredda", "Cersuta" and "Porto".
On 2 May 1676 the village of the "Borgo" was besieged by 160 bandits. However, the guards of the "Castello" killed the bandit leader and captured the remainder of the gang.
In the 18th century Maratea entered a period of progress and prosperity; on April 12, 1734 the first hospital of Basilicata was opened in the town. Many of the so-called 44 churches were built during this period.
When Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself King of Naples, Maratea was one of the few cities which did not accept French supremacy. In August 1806 the nearby town of Lauria, whose citizens also refused to acknowledge Napoleon, was set on fire by general André Masséna. Alessandro Mandarini, mayor of Maratea and commander of its castle, believing that Maratea would be the next target, evacuated the inhabitants to Sicily. Since Mandarini had been promised relief from the English army, he remained, with only 1,000 men, to defend the castle and the town. After three days under siege, Mandarini, who did not receive any help by the English, was forced to surrender (December 10, 1806). In token of their great admiration for the brave resistance, the French spared the lives of the rebels, but ordered them to pull down the walls of the castle. The latter was slowly abandoned during the 19th and 20th century.
After the return of the House of Bourbon to the throne of Naples, a movement developed that would have brought about the political unification of the peninsula. In 1848, one of its leaders, the revolutionary Costabile Carducci, was killed after years of being hunted by the Neapolitan militia.
In 1861, Italy was finally united. However, at this time Maratea suffered extreme poverty, in common with the rest of Basilicata. Many of its inhabitants emigrated to the United States or to Venezuela, and with their economic help Maratea was connected to the railway network in 1894, built its first aqueduct in 1902, had electrical connection from 1924, and tarred roads connected the "Old Town" with the outlying districts on the coast in 1930.
Thanks to the help of Stefano Rivetti, an Italian industrialist, in the 1950s the economic situation of Maratea improved: factories (a wooden-mill and an industrial estate) and many hotels were opened.
Main sights.
The Statue of Christ.
The statue of Christ the Redeemer, or the Christ of Maratea, was built of pure Carrara marble in 1965 by Bruno Innocenti, a sculptor from Florence. It is located on the top of Monte San Biagio, right in front of the basilica.
The 44 Churches.
Maratea is called "the town with 44 churches" for the number of its churches and chapels.
In the outlying districts are the rest of the churches which complete the list:
Other.
Maratea's territory is also home to six coastal watchtowers, dating to the 16th-17th centuries.
"Frazioni".
Maratea has two urban areas: one is located on the top of the mount San Biagio, called "Castello"; the other one is called "Borgo", situated on the north hillside of the same mountain.
Plus, the "comune" has several little villages, spread across the region.

<doc id="5967149" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967149" title="U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia">
U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia

U.S. Route 52 skirts the western fringes of the U.S. state of West Virginia. It runs from the Virginia state line near Bluefield, where it is concurrent with Interstate 77, in a general northwest and north direction to Interstate 64 at Kenova. There it turns east, overlapping Interstate 64 for five miles (8 km) before splitting off onto the West Huntington Expressway into Ohio via the West Huntington Bridge. Despite having an even number, US 52 is signed north–south in West Virginia. In some other states along its route, it is signed east-west. The West Virginia segment is signed such that U.S. 52 north corresponds to the general westward direction of the highway, and "visa-versa".
Most of the route is being upgraded to a high-speed four-lane divided highway, but not to interstate standards. It has been designated as part of the Interstate 73 and Interstate 74 corridors. From Interstate 77 south of Bluefield to near Williamson, the new highway has been referenced to as the King Coal Highway; from Williamson north to Kenova, it is the Tolsia Highway.
West Huntington Expressway.
The West Huntington Expressway is a controlled access elevated highway that crosses the west end of Huntington WV. It was constructed in 1965 and originally signed as West Virginia Route 94. The first segment to open was a stub from Interstate 64 to Jefferson Avenue in West Huntington in the fall of 1965. This included a bridge over a CSX railroad mainline. In the early 1970s, the expressway was extended northward across what is now the Nick Joe Rahall II Bridge across the Ohio River to U.S. Highway 52/State Route 7 in Ohio.
Tolls were collected at the Ohio River bridge until the mid-1980s. The expressway has four lanes from Interstate 64 to the U.S. Route 60 interchange, where it drops to two lanes for the remainder of the highway, which includes the Ohio River bridge. The expressway was renumbered U.S. Route 52 in 1979 when that federal highway was re-routed out of downtown Huntington to a new alignment on I-64 west to the Tolsia Highway south of Kenova.
Tolsia Highway.
The Tolsia Highway is defined as running from Interstate 64 at Kenova to Corridor G (US 119) north of Williamson. Portions of the highway have been completed.
In 1998, US 52 south of the Interstate 64 interchange in Kenova was upgraded to four-lane highway standards to the Tri-State Airport Access Road. In 2001, the four-lane highway was extended southward approximately two miles to a stub interchange with West Virginia Route 75, removing a steep downgrade with a large sweeping curve.
Also in 1998, the Prichard, West Virginia bypass was opened to traffic with one interchange and one at-grade intersection. This four-mile (6 km) bypass includes very large rock cuts and a long and winding grade down a hill. In 2001, the four-lane highway was extended northward for one mile (1.6 km), removing some grades and curves along US 52. The extension was completed in 2002 at a cost of $9,613,889.26. New signage was installed in late 2002 to replace orange construction signs that date to the construction of the bypass.
Before the eastern bypass was built, US 52 inside Prichard involved two alignments. U.S. 52 originally took the path of West Virginia Route 152, approximately east of the current alignment. In the mid-1960s, state funding was secured to upgrade most of county route 1, which ran along the Big Sandy River and Tug Fork River. The upgraded county route 1 was renumbered as US 52 in 1979. A western bypass of Prichard was constructed in the mid-1970s and partially abandoned in 1999, when the new four-lane alignment east of the community was constructed.
In 2001, the Crum segment of the Tolsia Highway opened to traffic. The highway begins just north of Crum, touching down at an incomplete diamond interchange with US 52 and heads eastward towards county route 2. It has at-grade intersections with county route 52-47 and county route 52-31 along with a side road at the eastern terminus that takes traffic to county route 2. There are stubs for future bridges and ramps. Signage along this segment is minimal, with only a handful of arrows to designate the route. While the highway was built to four-lane standards, it is only striped for two.
In late 2002, Senator Robert C. Byrd received $20 million in funds to jump-start construction on the northern half of the King Coal Highway. The money would be used to speed up construction on the link between Huntington and Prichard, serving several industrial parks and relieving two-lane US 52 of coal-truck congestion.
In 2003, survey and design of five miles (8 km) of four-lane US 52 upgrades from Prichard north to Cyrus were completed. This includes an interchange and five bridge structures. Estimated cost of construction is $90 million.
Total design work for 2003-2004 on the Tolsia Highway totals over .
Future projects.
The unfunded six-year transportation plans, released by the West Virginia Department of Transportation in 2005, has listed the Tolsia Highway as under several contracts. The six-year priority plans also list several Tolsia Highway projects with funding estimates and details.
Williamson Bypass.
U.S. 52 enters Kentucky twice along the Williamson, West Virginia bypass, preventing the blasting of several hillsides in West Virginia. It was completed in 1996 as part of the Corridor G (U.S. Route 119) project. The speed limit in West Virginia is but abruptly drops to in Kentucky.
The Tolsia Highway is expected to meet the King Coal Highway at West Virginia Route 65 and Corridor G (US 119).
Delbarton Connector.
The Delbarton Connector is part of the King Coal Highway, and will act as a four-lane expressway connecting US 119/US 52/Corridor G north of Williamson to the King Coal at Delbarton. Right-of-way acquision will commence in 2007, with construction beginning in 2008. It is also referred to as the Williamson Connector.
King Coal Highway.
The King Coal Highway is defined to run from West Virginia Route 65 and Corridor G (US 119) near Belo, West Virginia to Interstate 77 at its US 52 interchange near Bluefield. Interstate 66, Coalfields Expressway (US 121) and the Shawnee Expressway will connect to the King Coal Highway.
The travel time, currently over 120 minutes from Williamson to Bluefield, will be reduced to 87 minutes. South of Ikes Fork, a two-hour trip to Bluefield will be reduced to 44 minutes.
Interchanges and intersections proposed for the King Coal Highway include:
Work has progressed on the four-lane upgrading of US 52 in Mercer County just east of Bluefield. On November 24, a contract totalling $2,057,914 was let to move approximately of dirt and to grade and drain .22 miles from the recently completed $27 million interchange with Corridor Q (US 460) east of Bluefield to US 19 just north of James P. Bailey Lake. Six buildings will be demolished. This is the first of several projects that will extend the King Coal Highway to West Virginia Route 123 (Airport Road) north of Bluefield. Extending this project east, another contract was awarded December 15 and totals $1,371,251. The contract calls for more than of excavation to grade and drain .18 mile of the King Coal Highway from county route 25 just north of the US 460 interchange to south of the old Raleigh-Grayson Turnpike. 36 buildings will be demolished. A future contract will include a bridge over US 19 which will cost $15 million.
Work is set to begin on a stretch of roadway in Raleigh county at a cost of $12.2 million. This includes paving, guardrail installation, pavement marking, and signing operations for this segment.
Design work is being commenced on a segment of the King Coal Highway from Horsepen Mountain to Isaban and from the Mercer County Interchange to West Virginia Route 123/Airport Road. The work being done on a section of highway near Horsepen Mountain is being done by mining companies that will save taxpayers over $20 million.
The total cost for both the Tolsia and King Coal Highways will be over $2 billion.

Noepoli

Noepoli is a "comune" in the province of Potenza, in the southern Italian region of Basilicata. This ancient Lucanian village is situated in an idyllic position in the Sarmento Valley, at the heart of the Pollino National Park.
History.
Originally an Onotrio-Lucanian centre from the 8th to the 4th century BC, the village took on the name of Noia during the medieval period when it became a centre of learning for Greek Basilian monks. 
With the advent of the Normans during the 11th century, Noepoli became a Lordship of Count Alessandro of Chiaromonte as testified in a document which ratifies his donation from the S. Onofrio Monastery to the Cersosimo Church (1093). 
In 1404, it became an autonomous fief, but under the Aragonese it passed to the Del Balzo family and then to the Princes of Sanseverino of Salerno (15th century). 
In 1863, the village took on its present day name of Noepoli.
Events.
Religion plays a big part of social life in the area, with many religious festival involving the whole village and bringing the locals together. These include: Traditional Annual Fair on 5 April; Feast of Sant’Antonio on 13 June; Feast of the Madonna of Constantinople on 4–6 August (the largest and best known local event, with procession of votive altars and tarantella dance around the village); Feast of the Madonna del Rosario on 20 and 21 October; Pheasant and Chestnut Festival in November; Wine Festival on 8 December; Madonna of Pantano: Procession on Easter Monday; Feast on the 2nd Sunday in May; Fiaccolata on 7th and Feast on 8 September.

Salo Wittmayer Baron

Salo Wittmayer Baron (May 26, 1895 - November 25, 1989) was an American historian of Polish-Austrian Jewish ancestry and the most noted historian of the Jews of his generation. Baron taught at Columbia University from 1930 until his retirement in 1963.
Life and career.
Baron was born in Tarnów, Galicia which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but is now in Poland. Baron's family was educated and affluent, part of the Jewish aristocracy of Galicia. His father was a banker and president of the Jewish community of 16,000. Baron's first language was Polish, but he knew twenty languages, including Yiddish, Biblical and modern Hebrew, French and German, and was famous for being able to give scholarly lectures without notes - in five languages. Baron received rabbinical ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Vienna in 1920, and earned three doctorates from the University of Vienna, in philosophy in 1917, in political science in 1922 and in law in 1923. He began his teaching career at the Jewish Teachers College in Vienna in 1926, but was persuaded to move to New York to teach at the Jewish Institute of Religion by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise in New York.
Baron's appointment as the Nathan L. Miller Professor of Jewish History, Literature and Institutions at Columbia University in 1929 is considered to mark the beginning of the scholarly study of Jewish History in an American university.
According to Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Baron "was undoubtedly the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th century."
"In 1933, Jeannette Meisel, a graduate student in economics, consulted him about a dissertation she was writing. They married in 1934, and Jeannette Baron became a collaborator in his scholarly work.
"He and his wife, in their heyday, were a kind of partnership," Mr. Hertzberg recalled. "She helped with every one of his books, and they signed a couple of monographs together."
"Their magnum opus was "A Social and Religious History of the Jews" (Columbia University Press), which began as a series of lectures, turned into a three-volume overview of Jewish history published in 1937 and finally grew into a revised version"
"Well into his 90's, Professor Baron labored on volume 19, and he had projected at least two more volumes carrying the account of Jewish life through 1650." 
Baron opposed the " conception of Jewish history," sometimes identified with Heinrich Graetz, a great 19th-century Jewish historian who found the main elements of Jewish experience through the ages to be suffering and spiritual scholarship. In a 1975 interview, Baron said "Suffering is part of the destiny the Jews, but so is repeated joy as well as ultimate redemption."
Professor Baron also strove to integrate the religious dimension of Jewish history into a full picture of Jewish life and to integrate the history of Jews into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived.
On April 24, 1961, Professor Baron testified at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Baron explained the historical context of the Nazi genocide against the Jews. He further explained that in his birthplace, Tarnow, there had been 20,000 Jews before the war but, after Hitler, there were no more than 20. His parents and a sister were killed there.
In addition to his scholarly work, Baron was active in organizational efforts to maintain and strengthen the Jewish community both before and after World War II. From 1950 to 1968, he directed the Center of Israel and Jewish Studies at Columbia University. He received more than a dozen honorary degrees from universities in the United States, Europe and Israel and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964.
He died in New York City aged 94. The Salo Wittmayer Baron Chair of Jewish History, Culture and Society at Columbia University was created in his honor.

Percy Malcolm Stewart

Sir Percy Malcolm Stewart, 1st Baronet (9 May 1872 - 27 February 1951), was an English industrialist and philanthropist.
Stewart was born at St Leonards, Sussex, sixth of eight children of Halley Stewart. He entered his father's business in 1891. The cement business in which the family was interested - B. J. Forder & Son Ltd - became part of the British Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd in 1912, and Stewart became a managing director. He had remained managing director of the brick division of B. J. Forder & Son until it was amalgamated into The London Brick Company in 1923, and Stewart became chairman of its board. He became chairman of the board of the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd (APCM) in 1924 and remained in that position until 1945 when he became company president. He was thus chairman of the two of the largest monopolistic companies in British industry.
Sir Percy Malcolm Stewart and his father, Sir Halley Stewart, believed in good working and living conditions for employees. They developed the model village of Stewartby in Bedfordshire from 1926 onwards. As a special commissioner appointed by Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government of 1934, he helped devise schemes to reduce unemployment. In 1937 he was created a baronet.
During the 1930s, the hamlet of Wooton Pillinge, Bedfordshire, near the largest concentration of brickworks, was rebuilt as a model village for brick workers, and renamed Stewartby.

San Martino d'Agri is a picturesque hill town and "comune" in the province of Potenza, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata. It is a town of less the 800 people most of the year, but in August the population swells to around 2,000 when "Sammartinesi" return for the "Festa della Madonna della Rupe", some coming from as far as North America and South America. San Martino d'Agri is on the peak of a hill at 666 meters above sea level. At one point in the town's history, there was a major mudslide ("frana") that wiped out most of the town, however it recovered. Atop the hill stands a medieval castle, which was first owned by the "barone". However, after the "barone" was overthrown, there was a massive earthquake that destroyed much of the town. The castle was later renovated and divided up into sections for different families' housing. In the late mid-1900s, a section was abandon and wasn't renovated until 2003. That part, as well as another is currently owned and still being renovated.

History.
San Paolo Albanese was founded in approximately 1534 by ethnic Albanians refugees or Arbëreshë, from Corone, Morea in Greece which was occupied by the Ottoman Turks.
In the early 1900s, the town and much of Southern Italy saw a wave of emigration to the United States and South America. Immigrants initially clustered in the New York Metropolitan Area but can be found distributed throughout the US.
The population dropped during the late 19th, and late 20th century from 1,430 in 1861, 968 in 1911, 911 in 1961, to 306 in 2011.
From 1936 to 1962, the village was called Casalnuovo Lucano. 
With the opening of Albania in the last 20th century, Albanians again started coming to Italy. Politicians in the two countries have been working to build relationships between the communities.
Culture.
Language.
The Albanian language continued to be used as the primary language even after the establishment to the Foundation of Italy in 1870.During the 19th century, the dynamism of the Graeco-Albanian schools of Calabria and Sicily served to generate intense cultural development among the Albanian communities of southern Italy. Numerous Albanian intellectuals, for example, played an active part in the cultural renaissance of the southern regions of Italy and in the political movement of the Italian Rissorgimento. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of newspapers and magazines in Albanian. 
The late fifties marked the start of a certain cultural revival of Albanian, thanks to the founding of the Associazione Italiana per i Rapporti Culturali Italo-Albanesi, which published the journal Rassegna di Studi Albanesi from 1961 to 1963. Other cultural activities for the promotion of Albanian were the magazines Zgjimi, which disappeared in the late sixties, and Shêjzat, which was published from 1957 and 1974, the creation in 1969 of the Unione delle Comunità Italo-Albanesi and the founding of the Lega Italiana di Difesa della Minoranza Albanese in Cosenza in 1981, the celebration of the Settimane della Cultura Albanese in 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1981 and of the Prima Settimana della Cultura del Cossovo in Italia in 1980.
Today, however, Albanian in Italy has all the characteristics of the subordinate language in a diglossia situation. There is no organized Albanian cultural movement - apart from the AIADI (Associazione degli Insegnanti Albanesi d'Italia) - covering all of the areas inhabited by Albanian communities; cultural and linguistic initiatives always result from individual ideas which are subsequently supported by particular defenders of the language and certain local public authorities, ideas such as the literacy classes and courses in Albanian culture organized in some villages in 1987 by Education Office No 19 for Castrovillari with assistance from the EC.

East (novel)

East (also known as North Child in the UK and Australia) is a 2003 novel by the author Edith Pattou. It is an adaptation of an old Norwegian folk tale entitled "East of the Sun and West of the Moon" and is an ALA Top Ten Best Book for Young Adults. The novel is written in a style similar to that of Brian Jacques, including the use of a change in point of view in each chapter.
Plot.
When Arne married the superstitious Eugenia, he agreed to have seven children with her, one for each point of the compass, excluding North. Each direction foretells a different personality and Eugenia believes North is wild and uncontrollable. Also, Eugenia was told years before by a skjebne-soke ( a fortune teller) that any North Child she had would die crushed beneath an avalanche of ice and snow. Her favorite child, East-born Elise, dies young and Eugenia has another child to replace her, Rose. Rose feels out of place in her family, So when an enormous white bear mysteriously shows up and asks her to come away with him--in exchange for health and prosperity for her ailing family--she readily agrees. The bear takes Rose to a distant castle, where each night she is confronted with a mystery. In solving that mystery, she loses her heart to a polar bear, discovers her purpose of life, and realizes her travels have only just begun.
Reviews.
"East" is a deftly woven tapestry that melds traditional fairy tale motifs of both Beauty and the Beast and East of the Sun and West of the Moon, with the haunting icy lore of medieval northern lands. Told in a changing chorus of voices, including that of Rose, her hopeful brother Neddy, her regretful father, the charmed white bear, and the Troll Queen whose selfish wish is the catalyst that seals Rose’s fate, East will enchant any and all who venture within its pages. It is a tale for the Ages, and for all ages. Highly recommended. (Ages 12 and older) --Jennifer Hubert Review at "Fantastic Fiction"
"Pattou's writing pitches readers gracefully between myth and fantasy..." --School Library Journal 
"Readers with a taste for fantasy and folklore will embrace Pattou's lushly rendered retelling...Handsomely evoking a landscape filled with castles, trolls, shamans and spellbound princes, the story will exercise its audience's imagination." --Publishers Weekly
"Rose is a sturdy character inside and out...and the pace does pick up in the second half — but only fitfully does this achieve the intensity of feeling or vividness of setting that drives the best of the recent flurry of retold romances." --Kirkus Reviews
"The story itself is gripping, endlessly so...Pattou certainly has made a successful fantasy out of a simple fairy tale: each character has a fleshed-out personality and the details of such work as map making and sailing ships among the icebergs come to life as she describes them." --KLIATT

Air Forces of the National People's Army

The Air Forces of the National People's Army (German: "Luftstreitkräfte der Nationalen Volksarmee") was the Air Force of East Germany. As with the Landstreitkräfte, the Volksmarine, and the Border troops, it was a military branch of the National People's Army (NPA).
The name "Luftstreitkräfte" applied originally to the air corps of the German Empire between 1910 and the end of World War I in 1918. However, the West German air force adopted the name "Luftwaffe" as used by the Third Reich air force from 1935 to the end of World War II.
At the end of November 1953, a reorganisation of air units saw air units transferred from the Ministry of the Interior directly to the Deputy Minister and Chief of the People's Police. The air regiments were reorganized into the Aero Club 1 (Cottbus), 2 (Drewitz) and 3 (Bautzen), which in turn were divided into two sections. Starting in 1954, additional Z-126 and M-1D from Czechoslovakian production were made available. 
On 1 March 1956 the air force was officially established as part of the National People's Army, following the GDR's entry into the Warsaw Pact alliance. Initially the air force (LSK), with its headquarters at Cottbus, was separate from the "Luftverteidigung" (Air Defence, headquartered at Strausberg (Eggersdorf). It was intended to establish three fighter divisions, an attack aircraft division and an anti-aircraft division. However, eventually only the 1st and 3rd Aviation Divisions and the 1st Flak-Division were created. On 1 June 1957 there was a merger of the two administrations in Strausberg (Eggersdorf), and the new headquarters was renamed the Kommando LSK/LV.
Organization.
Kommando Luftstreitkraefte/Luftverteidigung (Kdo LSK/LV).
A decisive number of military units and formations have been under direct control of the Kommando LSK/LV, the "Air Force Staff" and the "Air Force Command" of the NPA, with its HQ in Strausberg.
1st Luftverteidigungsdivision (1st LVD).
The 1st LVD (en: 1st Air Defence Division), with its HQ in Cottbus, was in charge to provide air defence throughout the southern territory of the GDR. The following units were subordinated to that particular division:
3rd Luftverteidigungsdivision (3rd LVD).
The 3rd LVD (en: 3ed Air Defence Division), with its HQ in Trollenhagen, was in charge to provide air defence throughout the northern territory of the GDR. The following units were subordinated to that particular division:
FO FMTFK.
All fighter-bomber aircraft, transport aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft and transport helicopters were under the control of the FO FMTFK (roughly translates into: "Lead unit of the Frontal and Military air units", "Führungsorgan der Front- und Militärtransportfliegerkräfte"). The following units were part of the FO FMTFK: 
Insignia.
A diamond-shaped symbol identified NSK aircraftdivided into vertical black, red and gold stripes corresponding to the horizontal fesses or bars on the GDR state flag. The centre of the diamond portrayed the GDR coat of arms: a hammer and compass surrounded by a wreath of yellow grain. The symbol differentiated the Luftstreitkräfte from the West German "Luftwaffe", which displays a stylised Iron Cross similar to the emblem on German aircraft during World War I.
Uniforms.
The uniforms of the two German air forces were also different: following an older German tradition, LSK/LV uniforms were the same stone gray worn by army personnel, modified by distinctive blue insignia (similar in style, but not colour, to World War II Luftwaffe ranks) and piping. West German uniforms, on the other hand, were blue with yellow insignia and more closely modelled on those worn by "Luftwaffe" personnel during World War II.
Aircraft.
Starting in 1953, East Germany received An-2, La-9, Yak-11, and Yak-18 aircraft and the MiG-15 in 1956 which were provided by the Soviet Union. The first MiG-21s were delivered in 1962. The 1970s saw the introduction of the MiG-23, while Su-22 fighter-bombers were delivered in the 1980s. The latest addition was the MiG-29 in 1988. The inventory also included Soviet-built helicopters along with trainers and other light aircraft manufactured in Czechoslovakia. 
The East German Air Force was unique among Warsaw Pact countries in that it was often equipped with the most advanced Soviet fighters, instead of downgraded export models. As an extension of the Soviet 16th Air Army deployed in East Germany, the "Luftstreitkräfte" was expected to play a front-line role in any war with NATO. As a result, it was under closer Soviet control than the air forces of other Warsaw Pact states. 
After German reunification in 1990, the "Luftwaffe" assumed control over "Luftstreitkräfte" equipment and enlisted some of its personnel. Many of the GDR's military aircraft were obsolete or incompatible with NATO technical standards, and were sold to other countries. However, the "Luftwaffe" did retain the MiG-29 in both air defense and aggressor roles because of its excellent capabilities.

Georgia State Route 368

State Route 368 (SR 368) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is entirely within Elbert County and connects the Elberton area with South Carolina. It was originally built in 1940 as SR 82 and was redesignated as SR 368 in 1970.
Route description.
SR 368 begins at an intersection with SR 77 (Hartwell Highway) north of Elberton and travels to the northeast, through unincorporated and generally rural areas of the county. The highway crosses the backwaters of Lake Russell, before crossing over the main channel of the lake and terminating at the South Carolina state line. There, the roadway continues as South Carolina Highway 184.
SR 368 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.
History.
The highway that would eventually become SR 368 was built in 1940 as SR 82. This highway was on a more eastern alignment than the current route. By 1942, the entire route was paved. In 1943, the highway was shifted to its current alignment. In 1970, the entire length of SR 82 was redesignated as SR 368.

Esophageal hiatus

In human anatomy, the esophageal hiatus is a hole in the diaphragm through which the esophagus and the vagus nerve pass. It is located in the right crus of the diaphragm and fibres of right decussate inferior to the hiatus.
It is located approximately at level of the tenth thoracic vertebra (T10). 
The esophageal hiatus is situated in the muscular part of the diaphragm at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and is elliptical in shape. It is placed superior, anterior, and slightly left of the aortic hiatus, and transmits the esophagus, the vagus nerve, the left inferior phrenic vessels, and some small esophageal arteries from left gastric vessels. The right crus of the diaphragm loops around forming a sling around the esophagus. Upon inspiration, this sling would constrict the esophagus, forming an anatomical sphincter that prevents stomach contents from refluxing up the esophagus when intra-abdominal pressure rises during inspiration.

Aortic hiatus

The aortic hiatus is a hole in the human diaphragm. It is the lowest and most posterior of the large apertures.
It is located approximately at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12).
Structure.
Strictly speaking, it is not an aperture in the diaphragm but an osseoaponeurotic opening between it and the vertebral column, and therefore behind the diaphragm (Meaning that diaphragmatic contractions do not directly influence the Aorta or aortic supply).
Occasionally some tendinous fibers prolonged across the bodies of the vertebræ from the medial parts of the inferior ends of the crura pass posterior to the aorta, and thus convert the hiatus into a fibrous ring.
The hiatus is situated slightly to the left of the mid line, and is bound anteriorly by the crura, and posteriorly by the body of the first lumbar vertebra.
Structures passing through.
Through it passes the aorta, the azygos vein, and the thoracic duct; occasionally the azygos vein and hemi-azygos vein passes through the right crus.

Texas State Highway 158

State Highway 158 or SH 158 is a state highway running from near Goldsmith, Texas eastward to Ballinger, Texas.
History.
SH 158 was designated by 1933 on a route starting at Robert Lee travelling through Bronte then turning northeast, terminating at Abilene. The route was slowly built, being completed in 1939. In the 1939 general redescription, an additional non-connected section was added, beginning 20 miles west of Robert Lee in Sterling City and travelling west through Garden City and Midland, terminating just west of Goldsmith. 
In 1948, the section from Bronte to Abilene was transferred to U.S. Route 277, and was instead rerouted southeast to Ballinger, replacing State Highway 109 from Bronte to Ballinger. SH 109 was originally designated from Smithville to Yoakum on a route that became SH 95 by 1933. The two disconnected portions were finally connected in 1969 when Farm to Market Road 387, completed in 1959, was redesignated.

The Utilikilts Company

The Utilikilts Company is an American kilt company that was founded by Steven Villegas and Megan Haas in April 2000. Villegas created his first kilt in the late '90s as a comfortable alternative to pants meant to offer the most freedom of movement while working on his motorcycle. Created from an old pair of military pants, Villegas was so fond of his creation he wore it quite often around town. He was approached by his first customer, "a bouncer that you wouldn't want to mess with", at a local bar.
That first encounter encouraged him to produce more kilts, and sell them at the Fremont Street Market, in Seattle, where he met co-founder, Megan Haas. Villegas and Haas soon formed the Utilikilts Company, establishing both a brick-and-mortar and web based storefront for the product. Haas left the company in 2005.
Commercial success.
Utilikilt's commercial success is primarily from word of mouth, as the company does not pay for product placement or commercial endorsement and eschews professional models in favor of photos of actual customers. Despite this low-key approach, they grew from sales of 750 kilts their first year to over 11,000 three years later. The company received a big boost in recognition after Richard Hatch donned a Utilikilt on-screen in "".
The Utilikilt was also used as part of the costume for the O.Z. rebels in the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries "Tin Man" (2007)
The character Lafayette wears a Utilikilt in the premiere episode of HBO series "True Blood".
A Utilikilt is the featured prop promoting gender equality in Linda Biggs' artwork, "One of the Boys."

Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos

Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos (June 9, 1760, hacienda Ciénega del Rincón Jalisco—October 4, 1808, Mexico City) was a New Spain lawyer and politician and a proponent of independence from Spain. He was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities for his advocacy, and died in prison. He is considered one of the "protomartyrs" of Mexican independence.
Born at the hacienda of Ciénega del Rincón in what is now the Municipality of Ojuelos de Jalisco in the State of Jalisco but was then under the jurisdiction the village of Santa María de los Lagos (nowadays Lagos de Moreno); from the religious point of view, the hacienda of Ciénega del Rincón, belonged to the Parish Church of the actual city of Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes. Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos studied in the College of San Ildefonso in Mexico City, graduating as a lawyer. He was a student of the American and French Revolutions, and of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His friend and comrade Licenciado Juan Francisco Azcárate y Ledesma later described him as a "true scholar" ("sabio").
In 1808, he was a member of the "Cabildo" (city council) of the "ayuntamiento" (city government) in the capital of the viceroyalty. He was a Criollo by virtual of his birth in America, and a prominent member of the Criollo party in government. Criollos were prominent in the agitation for autonomy or independence from Spain, and this agitation was increasing. The Cabildo of Mexico City was composed of professional men, Criollos. It is possible that Primo de Verdad was also a member of one of the secret societies working for the independence of the colony, but that is not known with certainty.
Independence of Mexico.
On March 19, 1808, King Charles IV of Spain was forced to abdicate by Napoleon. News of the abdication was received in Mexico on July 11, 1808. The way now seemed open for the Criollo, party to achieve autonomy for New Spain. An old Spanish law was invoked that in the absence of the head of state, sovereignty reverts to the people, expressed through their representatives in the Cortes. The application of this law would allow a legal route for New Spain to weaken its ties with Spain. This was arguably an attempt to "preserve" the monarchical constitution in the face of foreign aggression, rather than a subversion of it.
On July 19, councilmen Azcárate y Ledesma and Primo Verdad presented a plan to form a provisional, governing junta for an autonomous New Spain, with Viceroy José de Iturrigaray at its head. The justification for this was that the mother country was now occupied by foreign troops, and the royal family was being held prisoner. The plan was accepted by the viceroy and the Cabildo, but not by the Audiencia. (Just as the Cabildo was dominated by liberal Criollos, the Audiencia was dominated by conservative "Peninsulares", large landowners and wealthy businessmen born in Spain.)
On August 9, 1808, at a meeting of Notables called to debate the situation, Primo de Verdad spoke in favor of popular sovereignty. Some of the oidores (members of the Audiencia) spoke in rebuttal, declaring the proposal seditious and subversive. Inquisitor Bernardo Prado y Ovejero declared it heresy and anathema. The Notables adopted an intermediate position — New Spain would recognize no supreme authority other than the king of Spain, now considered to be Ferdinand VII.
On August 31, 1808, the crisis took a sharper turn with the arrival of Juan Gabriel Jabat, representative of the Junta of Seville, and a message from the Junta of Asturias. Both juntas requested New Spain's recognition as the legitimate government of Spain, thus providing evidence of the lack of "any" legitimate government in the country.
On September 1, 1808, Melchor de Talamantes, a Peruvian priest and the intellectual leader of the Criollo party, delivered two tracts to the Cabildo, in favor of separation from Spain and the convoking of a Mexican congress.
On September 15, 1808, the Spaniards opposed to independence and popular sovereignty, headed by the rich businessman Gabriel J. de Yermo, staged a coup. Viceroy Iturrigaray was deposed and Primo de Verdad, Melchor de Talamantes and other members of the Criollo party were arrested. The viceroy was replaced with General Pedro de Garibay. Primo de Verdad and others were imprisoned in the jail of the archbishop, subject to trial. With this seizure of power, Yermo and the Peninsulares initiated a "half century of uprisings and coups d'état", in both colonial and independent Mexico (Fuentes Mares, p. 81).
Death.
On October 4, 1808, Primo de Verdad was found dead in his cell, of suicide or murder. Circumstances suggested the latter and poison was suspected, but that was never proven. Today in Mexico Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos is revered as one of the protomartyrs of Mexican independence.

Alangium

Alangium is a small genus of flowering plants. The genus is included either in a broad view of the dogwood family Cornaceae, or as the sole member of its own family Alangiaceae. "Alangium" has about 40 species, but some of the species boundaries are not entirely clear. The type species for "Alangium" is "Alangium decapetalum", which is now treated as a subspecies of "Alangium salviifolium". All of the species are shrubs or small trees, except the liana "Alangium kwangsiense". "A. chinense, A. platanifolium", and "A. salviifolium" are known in cultivation.
The genus consists of small trees, shrubs and lianas, and is native to western Africa, Madagascar, southern and eastern Asia (China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines), tropical Australia, the western Pacific Ocean islands, and New Caledonia.
Most of the species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of east and southeast Asia. Five of the species extend well outside of this area. "Alangium platanifolium" extends from east Asia into Russia. "Alangium chinense" (sensu lato) extends from southeast Asia to Africa. "Alangium salviifolium" is the most widespread species, ranging from Africa to Australia, Fiji, and New Caledonia. "Alangium villosum" occurs from southeast Asia to Australia and the western Pacific Islands. "Alangium grisolleoides" is endemic to Madagascar and gives the genus a disjunct distribution.
"Alangium" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species in the Geometroidea-Drepanoidea assemblage including the Engrailed (Geometridae) and the subfamily Cyclidiinae (Drepanidae).
The name "Alangium" is a Latinization, derived from the Malayalam name "Alangi", which, in Kerala, refers to "Alangium salviifolium".
It was named in 1783 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his Encyclopédie Méthodique.
The wood, fruit, and pollen of "Alangium" are distinctive. Fossils of "Alangium" have been recognized from the early Eocene of England and the middle Eocene of western North America. In former times, "Alangium" was far more widespread than it is today.
Characteristics.
Differences from the other genera in Cornaceae include articulated pedicels, subulate bracts, bitegmic seeds and the single-seeded fruit. The entire or lobed leaves are alternate. The bisexual (rarely unisexual) nectariferous flowers are arranged in axillary cymes. The flowers have 4-10 small sepals and 4-10 linear petals. There are 4–40 stamens distributed in a single cycle. The ovary is inferior and bilocular (sometimes unilocular). The fruit is drupe.
A detailed description of "Alangium" can be found at Flora of China (journal). Detailed botanical illustrations are available for several species.
Taxonomy.
In 2011, a Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences showed that "Alangium" is sister to "Cornus". Since 1939, "Alangium" has been divided into four sections: Conostigma, Rhytidandra, Marlea, and Alangium. Some authors have raised Marlea and Rhytidandra to generic rank. The intergeneric classification of "Alangium" will require a few changes.
Traditional uses.
One species, "Alangium chinense" (), is considered one of the fifty fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.

Porcupine (comics)

Porcupine is any of three fictional characters in Marvel Comics.
Publication history.
The first Porcupine first appeared in "Tales to Astonish" #48 (October 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck.
Fictional character biography.
Alexander Gentry.
Alexander Gentry was originally a scientist who worked as a weapons designer for the United States Army. He conceived the idea of designing a battle-suit in imitation of a porcupine: it would be covered with quill-like projections for defense. Moreover, it would be able to shoot its quills, or gases, flames, chemicals, paralysis-inducing pellets, or weapons from quill-like tubes, at an opponent. Gentry spends months working overtime to create his porcupine battle-suit. He is proud of his achievement when the suit was finished, and believes his invention is worth a fortune. Yet Gentry also believes that the government would pay him, one of its employees, virtually nothing for his creation. Angrily, Gentry decides to keep the porcupine battle-suit and to use it to become wealthy through crime. Thus Gentry became the Porcupine, one of the first costumed professional criminals of his generation.
Hank Pym, who was then the original Ant-Man, and his partner, Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, soon defeat the Porcupine while he attempted to rob a bank. However, the Porcupine succeeds in escaping. After Pym had also assumed the superhuman powers and identity of Giant-Man, Porcupine returns for revenge. During the resulting battle, the Porcupine consumes what he thinks is a Giant-Man growth medium, but which instead shrinks him to microscopic size.
Eventually, however, the capsules' effect wore off, and the Porcupine, again at his normal size, is among the many costumed menaces assembled by Doctor Doom to disrupt the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm.
His self-confidence still shaken by his failures in battling Giant-Man and the Wasp, the Porcupine eagerly accepts the invitation of Count Nefaria, a powerful figure in the criminal Maggia, to join his group of costumed agents. Among Nefaria's agents are the original Eel, the Plantman, the Unicorn, and the Scarecrow, with all of whom the Porcupine would ally himself in the future as well. The Porcupine and the other costumed agents aid Count Nefaria in his attempt to hold much of Washington D.C. for ransom. However, the original X-Men thwarted Nefaria and his agents. Once again, the Porcupine succeeds in escaping being taken prisoner, and he blames the failure of the blackmail scheme on Nefaria and the other agents. Gentry comes to suspect that in fact, he himself was inadequate for the role of being a "super-villain" battling superhuman opponents.
It is not known what the Porcupine did between the end of this venture and his enlistment as a member of Batroc's Brigade. As a Brigade member, the Porcupine unsuccessfully battles Captain America. Months later, the Porcupine and his allies, the original Eel, the Plantman, and the Scarecrow, went to work for the masked criminal mastermind who calls himself the Cowled Commander on his crime spree. Once again, the Porcupine clashed with Captain America but is defeated.
Convinced that they were failures, Gentry and Leopold Stryke, who was the original Eel, seek guidance from the Celestial Mind Control movement, which was secretly masterminded by the alien Nebulon. Nebulon pits the Porcupine and the Eel against his foes, the costumed adventurers called the Defenders, who defeat them both.
The Porcupine was then employed by the android Zodiac to participate in a crime spree. Porcupine was then employed by Justin Hammer to battle Iron Man.
Later, the Porcupine and a small group of confederates invade a major Manhattan hotel to steal the valuables in its safe. This time the Porcupine errs by deciding to rob the wealthy attendees at a fashion show in one of the hotel's ballrooms. Unfortunately for him, the show as being given by fashion designer Janet van Dyne, who is also the Wasp. Moreover, Henry Pym, who now uses the costumed identity of Yellowjacket, is also present, as is Kyle Richmond, the adventurer called Nighthawk. The heroes swiftly defeat the criminals. Porcupine feels humiliation at being taken down by opponents the size of insects.
The Porcupine next turns up as one of a large assemblage of costumed criminals organized by the original versions of Libra and Sagittarius of the android Zodiac. This time the Porcupine is defeated by the Hellcat during a battle between a number of the criminals and a group of adventurers operating under the auspices of the Defenders.
The Porcupine goes to prison but was soon released by minions of billionaire Justin Hammer. The Porcupine agrees to provide Hammer with half the proceeds from his criminal activities in exchange for Hammer's financial support. The Porcupine is among the small army of costumed criminals whom Hammer sends to attack Iron Man when the latter turned up on Hammer's enormous "houseboat" headquarters. Iron Man succeeds in defeating all of these criminals. Porcupine is soon fired by Hammer.
Tired of his long string of defeats, Gentry believes his criminal career had become a joke. He decides to give up his career as a costumed criminal and live off the millions of dollars he expects to receive by selling his battle-suit. Gentry totally redesigns his porcupine battle-suit, making it far deadlier than before. He enters into negotiations with the subversive organization called the Secret Empire to sell them the suit. The Empire requested proof of the battle-suit's capabilities, so Gentry said he would prove it was the perfect combat suit by testing it in battle against Captain America, the ultimate soldier. Captain America and his ally Nomad defeat the Porcupine, and Gentry was returned to jail.
In prison, Gentry vows never to be defeated again, and to ensure that, he decides never to put on the Porcupine battle-suit again. Gentry is soon released from prison under unknown circumstances, and he sets about once more to try to sell the battle-suit. He fails to find any serious buyers. Gentry tries to sell it to the Secret Empire, but is attacked by Nomad.
When most of the heroes were missing due to them partaking in Beyonder's Secret Wars, Porcupine joined Batroc and some other villains in fighting Moon Knight and Guardsman.
Porcupine later joined a short-lived version of the Lethal Legion in their mass-attack on New York's superheroes. He was knocked aside by a thrown printer and hit by a stray blast from Unicorn.
Gentry then tries to sell the suit to AIM, HYDRA, the Kingpin, the Maggia, the Tinkerer, various others, and finally to the Serpent Society, but almost no one wanted it, and the few offers he did receive for it were insultingly low. Despairing, Gentry came up with the idea of selling the battle-suit to the Avengers to prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. Captain America was intrigued and, in talking to Gentry, learned that he knew how to contact the Serpent Society, whom Captain America had been trying to bring to justice. Captain America agreed to have the Avengers buy the battle-suit if Gentry helped get him to members of the Serpent Society. Gentry accepted Captain America's terms. Captain America's plan was for Gentry to pretend to have captured him and to offer the Serpent Society the opportunity to kill him. Gentry contacts the Society's leader, Sidewinder, and arranges to have some of the Society members meet him at a lower Manhattan construction site. Gentry, having reluctantly donned his Porcupine costume once more as part of the plan, pretended to guard Captain America, who was seemingly bound with chains. Four Society members soon appeared: Cottonmouth, Death Adder, Diamondback, and the Rattler. Captain America took the Society members by surprise, and the Porcupine began to flee. Diamondback, realizing that the Porcupine had set them up, went after him and threw two nitroglycerin-filled diamond weapons. The weapons exploded on impact, damaging his battle-suit but not harming him. Seeing his only valuable asset damaged, Gentry flew into a rage and attacked Diamondback. She again damaged his suit somehow, and as he tried to escape her, he tripped and fell, inadvertently impaling himself fatally on one of his quills. Gentry died believing that he would die the same way he lived, as a loser, despite Captain America's assurances to the contrary. In tribute to Gentry, Captain America had him buried in a grave reserved by the Avengers for those who have fallen in battle, and put his battle-suit on exhibit in Avengers Mansion, labeled "Battle Armor of the Porcupine – Honored Foe of the Avengers".
Roger Gocking.
A person using the Porcupine identity and battle armor appeared in "Daughters of the Dragon" #3. Porcupine and other villains are attacked by Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, who were seeking information in the bar. Porcupine is quickly felled and thrown into Doctor Bong.
During the "Civil War" event, he is apprehended alongside Eel in San Francisco by the three rookie "Beetles" and their leader, MACH-IV. This group forms Thunderbolts Team A.
The Porcupine appears again in "Thunderbolts" #107 alongside the likes of the Eel, Doctor Octopus, Boomerang, Whirlwind and others who in separate teams of the new Thunderbolts face massive hordes of empowered people. These were everyday people empowered by an out of control cosmic source of energy called the Universal Well Spring.
The Thunderbolts entry in Volume 12 of the "Marvel Universe A-Z Handbook" hardcovers reveals the new Porcupine's real name is Roger Gocking.
During Doctor Doom's war with Wakanda over their Vibranium supplies, Porcupine was employed by former Damage Control worker Walter Declun in Mexico to defend one of Doctor Doom's outposts there from the Dora Milaje and the Fantastic Four.
Billy Bates.
A relatively normal teenager before manifesting his powers, Billy inadvertently killed a group of human patrons at the Cafe Des Artistes who were harassing the mutant waitress Sylvie, on whom he had a crush. He took her “hostage” which led to a police standoff. Rather than allow the situation to become a catalyst for anti-mutant strife in Mutant Town, also because one of Billy's victims was one of the leading people of the Louisiana chapter of Purity, Alexei Vazhin hired Sashenka Popova to assassinate Billy Bates. Vazhin then paid Sylvie and her father off to keep them quiet about the incident.
While he never officially took the name "The Porcupine," Billy intended to use it as his superhero name.
Powers and abilities.
The original Porcupine designed a suit of battle armor for himself composed of steel and advanced plastics that enhanced his strength and durability. The armor is equipped with a wide variety of offensive and defensive weapons built in. The outer surface of the armor is covered with razor-tipped metal quill-like projections which can be fired at opponents. The armor's other capabilities include laser beams, concussive bombs, small rockets, tear gas, sleeping gas, smoke screens, acetylene torch flames, liquid cement, wheels giving off hypnotic lights, and high voltage blasts of electricity. The battle-suit included belt jets which allowed him to fly for short distances. Gentry was a skilled automotive mechanic, and had a masters degree in engineering.
The second Porcupine's armor gives him some resistance to physical and energy attacks. The helmet has a 6-hour air supply and has night vision lenses. The quills do damage when striking opponents. His boot jets allow him to fly for up to 10 minutes. The Porcupine can fire three bombs at once and fire three knock out gas bombs at once.
Billy's offensive morphing power allowed him to sprout razor tipped spikes from his face, body, and right arm. These spikes were retractable, distorting the skin tissue to appear as acne. He could fire these spikes as projectile bolts with lethal force. Billy could also distort his left arm into a misshapen, extended form with elongated fingers and claws.
Other versions.
House of M.
In the "House of M" reality, William Bates was killed by Shashenka Popova when she stabbed him when William was trying to prevent her from fleeing the scene of a Sapien League attack.

VXA

VXA is a tape backup format originally created by Ecrix and now owned by Tandberg Data. After the merger between Ecrix and Exabyte, VXA was produced by Exabyte Corporation. On November 20, 2006, Exabyte was purchased by Tandberg Data who has since stopped further development of the format.
How it works.
Exabyte and Ecrix describe the data format as "packet technology." Since VXA is based on helical scan technology, data is written across the tape from side to side in helical strips.
The novel part of VXA packet technology is that each stripe starts with a unique packet ID and ends with an ECC packet checksum. As each stripe is written to tape, it is immediately read back to verify that the write was successful.
If the write was not 100% successful the packet can be rewritten at another point on the tape without stopping. When the data is read back, the packets are reassembled into a "buffer" by their packet ID. The buffer has 3 additional ECCs to ensure data integrity.
Another aspect of VXA is that there are 2 read heads for each stripe, slightly offset in relation to each other to allow for more flexibility in reading tapes written by other drives. 
Due to the relatively slow tape speed inherent to helical scan technology, the drive is able to stop and start the tape much more quickly to avoid the need to backhitch. 
Market context.
The VXA format competes mainly against the DDS, and DLT-IV formats.
Overview.
VXA-3.
Exabyte released two different product lines based on VXA-3 technology, VXA-320 in 2005 and VXA-172 in 2006. VXA-172 drives are limited to 86 GB per tape cartridge, but can be unlocked (for a fee) to remove the limit. They are otherwise the same. VXA-3 was the first helical scan system in production to feature thin film MR heads.

Albi, Calabria

Albi is a "comune" and town in the province of Catanzaro in the east southeastern portion of the Calabria region of Italy. Its population was 1,105 (2001), the area is 28 km² and the density was 39/km² (2001).
Population history.
The population grew until the 1950s except for between the censuses of 1901 and 1911, the commune was to be rocked by emigration as the population fell over half since the 1950s census. Emigration was very large between the 1950s and the 1970s. Due to the racial tensions and subsequent battles, the city was the inspiration for the song "Albi, The Racist Dragon" by folk duo Flight of the Conchords. This may be a reference to the City of Albi much further north in Europe; in regards to the Albigensian Crusade?

Amato

Amato () is a "comune" and town in the province of Catanzaro in the Calabria region of Italy.
History.
Amato is one of the oldest towns in Calabria. It is mentioned by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who calls it "Portus Amati Fluminis" (harbour of the Amato River). It is also mentioned by the Roman Pliny the Elder in one of his books. He calls it "Sinus Lametinus" (Lametino Harbour).
It appears that the people of Amato originated from the ancient city of Lametia, on the promontory of the Gulf of Sant'Eufemia, near the mouth of the Amato River. It was one of the most thriving cities of old Calabria, which at that time was called Bruttium.
From an English publication entitled "Brief History of Amato", we learn that Amato existed many years before the foundation of Rome. From this book we also learn that at that time Amato was very industrious and had a population of about 20,000 people. Its economy was centered around the very important textile industry, with about 1300 looms at work. In fact even up to a few years ago many Amatese women had a loom and many of them were very capable weavers. Production of the silkworm was also a very popular activity.
That primeval but progressive town was destroyed by floods and everything was buried underneath a swampy cover. Many of its inhabitants perished, others relocated to other cities like Sant'Eufemia, Nicastro, Sambiase, Bella, etc. Few families relocated to the hills of the plateau of the Amato River where they built a new town, but kept the same name.
These people settled on the hills of: Piano di Amato, Lachi, Cutro, Amendola and Andressi. This entire area was later called UMBRI and even today it is known by the same name. UMBRI in Latin means "saved from the floods". And it was here that these people built the new Amato. Remains of two old churches San 'Nicola and Sant' Andrea and of a castle nearby are proof of the existence of Amato at this location. Also, during some excavation work a golden cross and golden chalice were found. Later on, two workers PIETRO PINGITORE and FRANCESCO ROMEO (both presently residing in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) found in this same area some very old coins. Unfortunately all these were misplaced by the public authority before experts had an opportunity to study them.
The inhabitants of this new town, alas, did not have an easy time at this new location. In fact they were afflicted with malaria, they were constantly attacked by pirates and bandits and inundated by floods. They did not give up. They just moved to higher grounds at the present location of AMATO. AMATO is located to the north of the Cantanzaro Isthmus at an altitude of 480 metres above sea level, between the gulfs of Sant'Eufemia and Squillace. This new town appears to have been built during the Middle Ages when the Normans came to the Amato Plains. In fact, thanks to the Normans the Amato Plains were fortified against pirate attacks. They built castles at Nicastro, Maida, Feroleto and one also at Amato still in existence today.
The First Inhabitants (1000-800 B.C.).
The Italias were the first established people of Calabria. Later came the BRETTI from Lucania. These occupied Calabria and called it BRUZIO. The Bruzi were very advanced culturally. They dedicated themselves to agriculture and to the raising of domestic animals. Later they started handicrafts and industries; promoted commerce and developed the exchange of their products with nearby people.
The Greeks (800-300 B.C.).
Between the 8th and 7th century B.C. the Greeks occupied the shores of Calabria. Their first colonies soon became very wealthy and thriving by limiting their activities to the exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural products. Later they occupied all of southern Italy and monopolized the entire commerce of the region. Thanks to the Greeks, Calabria became a very industrious and productive region. It was part of "MAGNA GRECIA".
The Romans.
During the war between the Romans and Pyrrhus, the Bruzi fought beside the army of Taranto against the Romans. The Romans defeated Pyrrhus, occupied Taranto and all other cities of Calabria, including Amato. During the second Punic war, Calabria was occupied
by Hannibal and the Bruzi once again fought against the Romans. Hannibal was defeated and Calabria was Roman again. Rome imposed some very harsh penalties to the inhabitants of Calabria and many cities were burned down and destroyed. Was it then that Amato was
destroyed? No one knows. The contributions of Amato during the Punic wars are not known. We do however know that Amato at that time was located at a very strategic location in the Gulf of Sant'Eufemia and therefore could have played a very important role.
Barbarians, Bizantini, Saraceni and Normans.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Italy, no longer guarded by the Roman Legions, was invaded by the Barbarians. The Visigoths attacked and occupied Rome and later moved towards Sicily. After the Visigoths we have the Heruli, the Ostrogoths and the Bizantini. In 827 southern Italy was invaded by the terrible Saracens who burned down and destroyed everything that opposed them. They used to attack the coast of Calabria, steal childlren, and sell them as slaves.
The Normans.
After the accord of Melfi, Pope Niccolo II gave to the Normans the government of Calabria and Puglia. The Normans were very democratic and enterprising. We owe to them the creation of the Abbey of Sant' Eufemia Lamezia, the construction of the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Dipodi, the fortification of the Amato Plains and the introduction of the sugar cane. Under Norman rule the Amato Plains enjoyed peace and prosperity. Under their rule Pope Callistro II personally visited all the towns of the Amato Plains. During this visit he inaugurated the Sanctuary of Dipodi, consecrated the Cathedral of Nicastro, the Church of Mileto and then he went to Catanzaro to consecrate the Church Maggiore.
After the Normans - Feudalism.
From the 1st half of the 1400, the history of Amato begins to be better documented. At that time the territory of Amato was given to the feudatory Francesco Rodio of Catanzaro by Alfonso I, King of Naples. Then it was transferred to Prince Marcantonio of Loffredo. In 1635 it was given to Donato A. Mottola by the King of Spain. Donato A. Mottola was given the title of "MARQUIS of Amato". After his death the territory Amatese was inherited by his son ORAZIO MOTTOLA who was also Baron of Joppolo, Coccorino and Monterosso.
In 1675 the territory of Amato ceased to belong to the Mottola family and was subdivided into small holdings. The entire area was first called The University of Amato and later Commune of Amato. With the subdivision of the territory, every resident of
Amato became a private landowner. Vast territories were granted to the wealthiest families: Anania, Caligiuri, Can-
tafio, Cianflone, Cosentino, D'Amico, Falvo, Fiorentino, Grande, Graziano, Jenzi, Lo Scerbo, Lo Schiavo, Mauro, Mazza, Mottola, Pallone, Papucci, Rossi, Todaro, Torchia. The Commune of Amato kept for itself the forestland. This was however contested by the Mottola family. This dispute was later resolved by the King Commissioner Angelo Masci. Under his ordinance the commune of Amato was granted two thirds of its claim, more specifically: Montagna Soprana and Montagna Sottana. The other one third was given to the Mottola family. The commune also received one half of the territory known as "Mugamero" with the other half remaining to the
Mottolas.
With the subdivision of the Amato territory, many residents became small landowners. However many were unable to survive from these little farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families. But by the 19th century the cycle reversed again. The family units began to disintegrate and larger farms became smaller units once again because of subdivisions amongst heirs.
The lands that the richer landowners did not cultivate themselves, when not needed for pasture, were given to share-croppers. These were responsible for the farming of the land and in return would keep 3/4 or 2/3 of the net production, depending on the crop. They were allowed to keep a pig, a goat, some sheep and chickens on the land to help them provide for their families. This procedure, good up to 1900, was improved by Dr. Giuseppe Caligiuri who in order to induce his share-croppers to cultivate more land put at their disposal a plough pulled by two oxen.
Dr. Caligiuri's initiative was not well received by the other "padroni". They believed that this new approach to farming would benefit more the share-cropper than it would benefit them. Instead of supporting this brilliant initiative, the other landowners closed themselves into a mean conservatism not well received by the sharecroppers.
Share-croppers were soon prohibited to raise their own animals even though located far away from the land of the "padrone". People had not been subject to these measures and such working conditions not even during feudalism. To make things worse, this happened at a time when farmers were anticipating greater assistance to increase productivity through modern farming machinery, selected seeds and fertilizers. Loss of freedom and the inability of the share-croppers to provide for their families induced them to one by one abandon the lands that they and their fathers before them had farmed for years and were deeply attached to. They left their lands; they left Amato and immigrated into more industrialized nations in search of a future for their children.
San Francesco di Paola.
Saint Francesco of Paola is the patron saint of Amato. In the central square of Amato stands a statue of the patron saint that protects the commune. It was erected thanks to Father Serafino Falvo and is the work of sculptor Ruggero Pergola of Pietrasanta, Lucca. It was inaugurated on May 28, 1966 with the participation of various religious and political figures and the Amatese citizenship.
Demographics.

Bainbridge State College

Bainbridge State College is a four-year state college of the University System of Georgia in Bainbridge, Georgia. For more than 30 years, Bainbridge College has provided higher education to the residents of southwest Georgia. The College is among the fastest growing in the State of Georgia, enjoying a 52 percent increase in enrollment since Fall 2001.
The college’s campus is located on of land just inside the Bainbridge city limits on U.S. Highway 84 East. The College is a community institution with no on-campus residence facilities.
A separate campus in Blakely, Georgia is Bainbridge College Early County (which was built in 1999 as Albany Technical College. The Early County Satellite Center was bought by Bainbridge College in 2006).
Students commute from the nearby towns of Attapulgus, Blakely, Brinson, Cairo, Camilla, Climax, Colquitt, Donalsonville, Iron City, Pelham, Thomasville, and Whigham. With the inclusion of Gadsden County to the College's service area, students from neighboring Florida communities also attend the College as in-state students.
It was established in 1970 with support of local citizens, including former Georgia governor Marvin Griffin, and its doors opened in 1973, during the Governor Jimmy Carter administration. Dr. Edward Mobley was the first President. He served from the beginning of the college until 1999, when Dr. Clifford Brock took over, for what proved to be a tumultuous relationship. Dr. Sherman Day was assigned as interim President upon Dr. Brock's exit and gave the college a sense of stability once again. Dr. Thomas Wilkerson became President in 2005.
The 1973 charter faculty consisted of:
Dr. Robert DuBay, Dean; Dr. R. Everett Langford, Chemistry and Geology; Dr. Ray Chambers, History.
On February 13, 2013, the Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia officially announced that Bainbridge College had been converted into a 4-year state college, and the name was officially changed to Bainbridge State College.

Aussie Elliott

Aussie Elliott (1914 – February 3, 1934) was a Depression-era outlaw and associate of bank robbers George Birdwell and Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd. Born in Oklahoma, Elliott was convicted of bank robbery in 1932 and sentenced to the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma eventually escaping on August 14, 1932. Soon after joining Birdwell and Floyd, the three robbed a bank in Sallisaw, Oklahoma of $2,530. Although identified by witnesses raiding a bank in Henryetta of $11,352 only six days later, several reports attributed the robbery to the Ford Bradshaw gang.
Along with Adam Richetti and Edgar Dunbar, Elliott robbed $3,000 from a bank in Ash Grove, Missouri on January 12, 1933 before fleeing to the home of Richetti's brother in Bolivar. Captured four months later in Creek County, Oklahoma on May 14, Elliott was imprisoned for five months before again escaping on October 28. Despite the extensive manhunt by authorities, Elliott refused to flee Oklahoma and, along with bandits Raymond Moore and Eldon Wilson, was eventually trapped by police near Sapulpa, Oklahoma and engaged in a gun battle resulting in the deaths of all three men as well as Sapulpa Police Chief Tom Brumley and Patrolman Charles Lloyd on February 3, 1934.

Carol Semple (born February 23, 1966) is an American professional fitness competitor. In regional, national and international competitions, she has won 15 titles.
Early life and setbacks.
Semple began gymnastics training at the age of 10. Her dream was to compete in Olympics gymnastics events. However, she was found to have Osgood-Schlatter disease, a childhood condition in which the bones grow faster than the muscles they support. This, along with the financial burden associated with training, ended her dream of Olympic competition. The severe injuries she suffered in an auto accident on May 23, 1983 meant she had to give up gymnastics entirely.
Career in fitness.
Semple worked as a fitness instructor at a local spa during her 20s. While training there, she became aware of the Ms. National Fitness competition and started training for it. She became the first to win the Ms. Fitness USA and the Ms. Fitness World back-to-back, and to win the Ms. Fitness USA and the Ms. Fitness World in the same year.

Badolato

Badolato is a "comune" and town in the province of Catanzaro in the Calabria region of Italy. As of 2007 Badolato had an estimated population of 3,275.
Territory.
The village of Badolato is 30 km from Catanzaro on Calabria's Ionian coast. Situated approximately 240 m above sea level, Badolato has several Byzantine churches arranged in the shape of a Latin cross, and many small alleyways characteristic of medieval towns. It is an agricultural center for the area on the Ionic side of the Calabrian mountain range, located on the north-western slopes of Mount St. Nicholas. It occupies a spur between two valleys which open out to the coastal plain below. Above the railway station is the town of Badolato Marina, situated on the SS106 Ionica state highway.
History.
During the Angevin era of the Kingdom of Naples, Badolato was controlled by local lords who took control from Pietro Ruffo, Count of Catanzaro. In 1454, Badolato became a barony held by the Toraldo family until 1596. It then passed to the Ravaschieri in 1596, to the Pinelli in 1692 and to the Pignatelli of Belmonte from 1779 to 1806. Severely damaged by the earthquakes of 1640, 1659 and 1783, the town was also hit by the floods of 1951.
Main sights.
Ruins of the perimeter walls of the Ravaschieri castle, said to date from the 17th century, still exist. The Church of Sant'Isidoro, in the village of the same name, bears traces of Byzantine frescoes. The Church of Sant'Andrea Avellino has two wooden busts of St. Andrew and St. Francis of Paola and valuable, sacred furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries.
In the church of Santa Caterina there is an ornate altar and a table depicting the Madonna and Child, both from the 15th and 16th centuries. In the Chiesa dei Riformati, there is a piece of the official altar of frà Diego de' Careri, 1644, a crucifix from the same artist and major works of art from the eighteenth century. The church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, along with the adjoining convent of Friars Minor, is of Baroque design.
Economy.
Badolato is known as a centre of oil production and wine, which are largely exported. Farm also produce grain and fruit. There are many companies the business of breeding cattle, sheep and goats, as well as the processing of dairy products. Until recently some families used hand looms for the production of blankets and scarves of wool and silk, and also distilled turpentine. There are also oil mills and shirt factories.
Increasingly tourism is becoming important with a number of the houses in the village being renovated or rebuilt as second homes of a high standard. Bed & breakfast services are operating in Badolato Superiore while in Badolato Marina a new development of second homes for the Danish market has joined the existing hotels and facilities.

WWF Rage in the Cage

WWF Rage in the Cage is a professional wrestling video game released on December 21, 1993 for the Sega CD gaming system. It is a spin-off of sorts of LJN's 16-bit WWF games, as the gameplay engine and graphical style are the same as in "WWF Royal Rumble" for the Super NES and Sega Genesis. 
Features.
"Rage in the Cage" was the first WWF game to feature actual video footage in the form of FMV clips seen in the game's opening video, as well clips of the wrestlers' signature moves that can be viewed on the wrestler select screen, and clips that play of the player's wrestler celebrating upon completion of the tournament mode. In addition, the game features audio introductions by Howard Finkel and rants between the competitors prior to the matches. However, for the game's music, developers did not take advantage of the CD format, as it resembles the synthesized music of 16-bit games from that period. "Rage in the Cage" features 20 wrestlers, the most seen in a WWF game up to that point (this number would not be surpassed until "WWF Attitude" was released six years later).
Gameplay.
Possesses punches and kicks, several grapple moves (executed via a "tug-of-war" style lockup system), running attacks, a move off the top turnbuckle, and a signature finishing move unique to that wrestler. Also available are illegal eye gouges and chokeholds, which can only be done outside the ring or if a referee is not present.
Several match variations are available for either one player versus the computer, or two players head-to-head. A One Fall match is a standard bout won by pinfall. In a Brawl match, there is no referee, no count-out, and illegal moves can be done at all times. The match ends only when one wrestler lacks the energy to continue. A Cage Match puts the wrestlers inside of a steel cage. There are no holds barred, and victory is achieved by escaping the cage. Also available is a one-player Tournament mode, where the player selects a wrestler and must defeat the rest in a series of One Fall matches to become WWF Champion. Upon completion, a FMV clip of the wrestler celebrating a victory is shown.
There are no tag team modes, despite the inclusion of tag teams in The Headshrinkers, Money Incorporated, and The Nasty Boys.

Brad Lohaus

Bradley Allen "Brad" Lohaus (born September 29, 1964) is an American retired professional basketball player who was selected by the Boston Celtics in the second round (45th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft. A 6'11" center-power forward from the University of Iowa, Lohaus played in eleven NBA seasons for eight different teams: the Celtics, Sacramento Kings, Minnesota Timberwolves, Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs, New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors.
High school and college.
Lohaus was a McDonald's All-American at Greenway High School in Phoenix, Arizona under varsity coach Pete Babcock, who went on to work for six different NBA franchises in various capacities, including general manager.
Lohaus played at Iowa from 1982 to 1987 under three different head coaches. He was recruited and played his freshman season under head coach Lute Olson. After Olson left for The University of Arizona, Lohaus reluctantly stayed at Iowa and played his sophomore and junior seasons under George Raveling (redshirting a year between seasons). He then flourished during his senior season under new coach Dr. Tom Davis as a shooting big man who defended the front of the Hawkeyes' fullcourt pressing defense. That year, the team reached the NCAA Elite Eight, ending with a school record 30 wins, with Lohaus averaging 11.3 points and leading the team in rebounds and blocked shots.
Professional career.
Lohaus was drafted by the Boston Celtics late in the second round; in 1987–1988 the team went 57-25 in the regular season, and bowed out to the Detroit Pistons in the hard-fought six-game Eastern Conference Finals. He was traded along with Danny Ainge to the Sacramento Kings for Joe Kleine and Ed Pinckney on February 23, 1989.
Lohaus was acquired by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA Expansion Draft, then traded on January 4, 1990 to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Randy Breuer, giving Lohaus the opportunity to further display his perimeter game and long-range shooting ability. He also completed his bachelor's degree at The University of Iowa the ensuing summer semester.
After that season, Lohaus played an additional four full seasons for the Bucks, scoring 314 three-point field goals (whereas he was 5 for 40 in his first 2½ seasons). The Bucks advanced to the playoffs twice in that timeframe.
He then played for the Miami Heat in 1994–1995 with former Iowa teammate Kevin Gamble, where Lohaus averaged 4.4 points per game. He spent his final three seasons with the Spurs, Knicks (via trade, with the Knicks getting Lohaus, J.R. Reid and a first-round pick in 1996, while the Spurs received Charles Smith and Monty Williams), Toronto (November–December 1996), a stint with the Italian team Scavolini Pesaro (October–December 1997), then back again with the Spurs in 1997–1998, later in the season and into the playoffs. During the lengthy NBA lockout in 1998–1999, Lohaus contemplated retiring and ultimately did not play professionally again.
In his NBA career, Lohaus played in 656 games over 11 years, scoring a total of 3,854 points, and converting 392 three-point shots (over 30% of his total points scored).
Lohaus appears in the video game "NBA Jam" as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks.
He has had a home in the Iowa City area since 1987, and is a scout with the Spurs organization, covering the midwest region, and also is a broker for commercial airplanes and airplane parts. He and his wife Anne have two sons, Wyatt and Tanner. He endowed a full athletic scholarship to the Iowa Hawkeyes basketball program in 1996, the first former student-athlete to do so in the school's history.

<doc id="5967468" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967468" title="Deltoid tuberosity">
Deltoid tuberosity

In human anatomy, the deltoid tuberosity is a rough, triangular area on the anterolateral (exterior-front) surface of the middle of the humerus to which the deltoid muscle attaches.
Variation.
It has been reported as very prominent in less than 10% of cases.
Development.
The deltoid tuberosity develops through endochondral ossification in a two-phase process. The initiating signal is tendon-dependent, whilst the growth phase is muscle-dependent.
Evolutionary variation.
In mammals, the humerus displays a wide morphological variation. The size and orientation of its functionally important features, including the deltoid tubercle, greater tubercle, and medial epicondyle, are pivotal to an animal's style of locomotion and habitat. In cursorial (running) animals such as the Pronghorn, the deltoid tubercle is located about a quarter of the way down the shaft, which allows for rapid but relatively weak limb flexion and extension. In natatorial (swimming) animals such as the North American River Otter, the tubercle is located nearly halfway down the shaft, which allows for powerful limb flexion and extension. The tuberosity can be very pronounced in fossorial (digging) animals, such as the Mountain Beaver.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the subdivisions of Wales formed in April 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, resulting in 22 principal areas.

<doc id="5967519" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967519" title="Dicyanoacetylene">
Dicyanoacetylene

Dicyanoacetylene, also called carbon subnitride or but-2-ynedinitrile (IUPAC), is a compound of carbon and nitrogen with chemical formula C4N2. It has a linear molecular structure, N≡C−C≡C−C≡N (often abbreviated as NC4N), with alternating triple and single covalent bonds. It can be viewed as acetylene with the two hydrogen atoms replaced by cyanide groups.
At room temperature, dicyanoacetylene is a clear liquid. Because of its high endothermic heat of formation, it can explode to carbon powder and nitrogen gas, and it burns in oxygen with a bright blue-white flame at a temperature of 5260 K (4990 °C, 9010 °F), which is the hottest flame of any chemical. This high flame temperature is also the result of the absence of hydrogen, and, therefore, water, as a combustion product. Because of its high specific heat, water vapor as a combustion product tends to lower the flame temperature of hydrogen-containing compounds. The endothermic dissociation of water at high temperatures above 2000 °C also prevents flame temperatures from rising above 3000 to 4000 °C.
Synthesis.
Dicyanoacetylene can be prepared by passing nitrogen gas over a sample of graphite heated to temperatures between 2673 to 3000 K.
As a reagent in organic chemistry.
Dicyanoacetylene is a powerful dienophile because the cyanide groups are electron-withdrawing, so it is a useful reagent for Diels-Alder reactions with unreactive dienes. It even adds to the aromatic compound durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) to form a substituted bicyclooctatriene. Only the most reactive of dienophiles can attack such aromatic compounds.
In outer space.
Solid dicyanoacetylene has been detected in Titan's atmosphere by infrared spectroscopy. As the seasons change on Titan, the compound condenses and evaporates in a cycle, which allows scientists on Earth to study Titanian meteorology.
, the detection of dicyanoacetylene in the interstellar medium has been impossible, because its symmetry means it has no rotational microwave spectrum. However, similar asymmetric molecules like cyanoacetylene have been observed, and its presence in those environments is therefore suspected.

Media in Ethiopia

The mass media in Ethiopia consist of radio and television, which remain under the control of the Ethiopian government, as well as private newspapers and magazines. In comparison to the length of Ethiopia's over-2,000-year history as a sovereign nation, the media is a very recent phenomenon. 
__NOTOC__
Ten radio broadcast stations, eight AM and two shortwave, are licensed to operate in Ethiopia. The major radio broadcasting stations include Radio Ethiopia, Radio Fana(or "Torch") a private station, Radio Voice of One Free Ethiopia, and the Voice of the Revolution of Tigray. The single television broadcast network is Ethiopian Television, with 24 hours of broadcast and three regional stations, namely Addis TV, TV Oromiyaa (with two live studios), and Dire TV. In keeping with government policy, radio broadcasts occur in a variety of languages. 
Print media, because of high poverty levels, low literacy rates, and poor distribution outside of the capital, serve only a small portion of the population. The paucity of distribution is mirrored by a scarcity of diversity in the official press. Since the end of the civil war private newspapers and magazines have started to appear, and this sector of the media market, despite heavy-handed regulation from the governmen and the ups and downs of Ethiopia's economy, continues to grow. Despite increasing pressure from the current government at home, the much more affluent and cosmopolitan Ethiopian diaspora abroad has helped further the cause for a free press in Ethiopia, and has also catered to its many extranational communities with news services (both online and off) in both Amharic and English.
When the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) came to power in 1991, one of their first acts was to give the Ethiopian media far more freedoms than it had previously experienced, ending the censorship that had prevailed for decades under both the Derg and the imperial regime, these rights have since been reneged gradually, in particular since the elections in 2005. Despite this liberalization, the relationship between the EPRDF and the private press has been one of deep mistrust. Clampdowns on the private press occurred regularly in the 1990s, with the arrest of dozens of journalists who were accused of publishing false information, or violating other provisions of the 1992 press law. This law allowed government authorities to detain journalists without charge. According to Human Rights Watch, the high point of freedom for Ethiopian media was in period leading up to the 2005 elections. Following the controversial election, when there were many instances of disproportionate violence by authorities, many journalists were arrested, alongside member of opposition parties, and afterwards tried for "outrages against the constitution" and other crimes, a number of them "in absentia". Fines were also imposed on Ethiopian publishing houses.

Martinez was particularly concerned with issues surrounding women’s health. She passed legislation that obligates health insurance companies to provide women with contraceptive coverage. In recognition of this legislation, Martinez received the Profile in Courage Award from Planned Parenthood. Martinez targeted Illinois drivers with out of state reckless homicide and DUI convictions with the passage of a new law. This law ensures that convictions received in other states are included in Illinois driving records and subject to state laws regarding further prosecution of these offences. To help protect consumers from becoming victims of identity theft, Martinez helped pass a law that requires all insurance cards be issued without a Social Security number. 
In 2004, Martinez was awarded the Hillary Rodham Clinton Leadership Award presented to an elected official by the Illinois Democratic Women’s organization. Martinez is the Chairperson of the Pensions Committee and Vice Chairperson of the Housing and Community Affairs Committee.

In 2006, Martinez endorsed judicial candidate Ramon Ocasio III over the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed candidate, Ed Lechowicz, the son of former State Senator Ted Lechowicz, saying she did so to increase the number of Latinos on the Cook County judiciary.
2008 re-election campaign.
In 2008, Martinez faced a primary challenge from state representative Richard T. Bradley, who represented half of her district in the House. Bradley had originally announced his intention to seek re-election to the House but decided instead to challenge Martinez when Deb Mell announced her candidacy for his House seat. Martinez was re-elected, defeating Bradley and another candidate.

Dulce Ilusión

Dulce Illusion (1993) is a Venezuelan telenovela that was produced by and seen on Venezuela's Radio Caracas Televisión. It was written by Mariela Romero. This telenovela lasted between 198 and 92 episodes and was distributed internationally by RCTV International. This was the first telenovela to use Venezuelan cartoons with real people, in fact, it’s the only one in the history of Venezuelan soap operas, and the great success of this RCTV’s material is partly due to the big innovation of the cartoons. The animated characters were developed by the legendary animator Felix Nakamura and his team.
Synopsis.
A modern-day Cinderella meet her young Prince Charming in a unique series that weaves romance, dreams, fantasy, and evil... all in one unprecedented telenovela: Dulce Ilusión (Sweet Dream). The story begins in the midst of the tropics... where nature, in all its majesty, create and aura of wonder. Dulce María is born there - and heiress to her parent's lands and vast fortune. Through a twist of fate, however, her ruthless governess Zarina robs her of her rightful inheritance and raises Dulce María as a servant in her own home, convincing her that she had been born a penniless orphan. Despite her stepmother's cruelty, Dulce María grows to become a young woman full of optimism and innocence. Her genuine nature wins the hearts of many of the townspeople, specially the local children. Among these is Caraotica, an unforgettable boy with strange powers; in reality, Caraotica is an angel who inadvertently "fell" into the convent's backyard while on a mission from heaven to Villa del Mar. Sor Ada, the nun who educated Dulce María, becomes her confidante and greatest source of moral support. In her youth, Sor Ada had experienced everything from hunting tigers in the wild to singing classic love ballads, and thus instills in Dulce María a pronounced idealism and zest for life. It's no wonder, then, that Dulce María is regarded as a dreamer... a young girl who shares her dreams and adventures with imaginary characters: a lively lizard named Homero, symbol of emotion; the toucan Prometeo symbol of reason; and the coquettish canary Alicia Josefina, symbol of love. One day, Dulce María is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Juan Francisco, a recently graduated military cadet. This marks the beginning of a passionate love story; one which will be threatened by envy, jealousy, and blind ambition. However, with the help of Jacques Delfin, a mysterious and eccentric man who lives on a yacht off the coast of Villa del Mar, Dulce María and Juan Francisco will finally unravel the secret of her birthright and find true love.

Supraglenoid tubercle

The supraglenoid tubercle is a region of the scapula from which the long head of the biceps brachii muscle originates. It is a small, rough projection superior to the glenoid cavity near the base of the coracoid process. The term supraglenoid is from the Latin "supra" meaning above and "glenoid" meaning socket or cavity.
Clinical relevance.
Biceps tendonitis originates on the long head of the biceps brachii at the supraglenoid tubercle in 30% of cases. The symptom is generally anterior biceps instability but the disease can also be characterized by chronic anterior shoulder pain which radiates towards the lateral part of the elbow. In cases of Biceps Tendonitis steroids can be injected flouroscopically at the supraglenoid tubercle to reduce pain associated with the pathology.

Bill Meek

William M. Meek (1922 – ) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Kansas State University (1947–1950), the University of Houston (1951–1954), Southern Methodist University (1957–1961), and the University of Utah (1968–1973), compiling a career college football record of 78–88–7.
Early life.
Meek was born in Waterbury, Connecticut and his family moved to Birmingham, Alabama in his youth. In college, he earned three letters playing as a back-up quarterback for the University of Tennessee; he graduated in 1943.
Coaching career.
Meek had his first head coaching experience at age 22, with the Fort Benning Doughboy football club in 1944, while serving in the Army during World War II. Most of the starters on the team were members of the great Army teams of the early 1940s, and the team defeated all opponents except for a 0–7 loss to Auburn University. Marty Blake, later the NBA director of scouting, was one of the team managers. Following the war, Meek left the Army with the rank of captain.
Meek served as an assistant football coach throughout the remainder of the 1940s. From 1947 to 1950, he coached under Jim Tatum at the University of Maryland. During his tenure there, Meek was credited with the development of backs Ed Modzelewski and Bob Shemonski.
In 1951, Meek was offered the his first collegiate head coaching position at Kansas State with an initial salary of $8,000. Meek was offered the job even though he told the hiring committee at K-State that the program was a huge mess. His first season he posted a 1–7–1 record, typical for Kansas State at the time. When he learned after the season that an ineligible player had participated, he self-reported the violation to the NCAA and the school voluntarily forfeited the win and the tie. The following season, the squad went 1–9. Meek — who had already proven his integrity — accepted the services of several former Army players who resigned from the academy after violating the honor code in 1951. In 1953, Kansas State posted a 6–3–1 record, the first winning season at the school since Wes Fry's 1936 team. After starting that season 5–1, K-State also received its first national ranking, at #18 in the Coaches Poll on October 28, 1953. The following year was even better, with Kansas State posting a 7–3 record and playing for an Orange Bowl berth in their final game (they went on to lose at Colorado). Meek left Kansas State following the 1954 season, when the school refused to give raises to his assistants. Kansas State wouldn't have another winning record for 16 years.
In January 1955, Meek took over as the head coach at the University of Houston. In two years at Houston, from 1955 to 1956, Meek compiled a 13–6–1 record. In his second season, Meek led the Cougars to the Missouri Valley Conference championship and was named the Missouri Valley Coach of the Year.
In 1957, Meek took the job as head coach of the SMU Mustangs. During his tenure, from 1957 to 1961, he compiled a 17–29–4 record, while coaching All-American quarterback Don Meredith. By far his worst season at SMU was 1960, when his team went 0–9–1, with the only game decided by less than 10 points being a 0–0 tie with Texas A&M.
From 1962 to 1967, Meek worked as an assistant coach, including stints as Director of Pro Personnel for the Denver Broncos and as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys. Meek was offensive coordinator for Army during the 1966 and 1967 seasons.
In 1968, he took his final coaching job, as head coach for the University of Utah. Meek guided the team to a 33–31 record between 1968 and 1973, and his 1969 Utes squad posted an 8–2 record.

Pterinochilus murinus

The baboon spider Pterinochilus murinus, an old-world tarantula, was first described in 1897 by Reginald Innes Pocock. This species is found on the African continent, in Angola, as well as central, eastern, and southern Africa.
Among those who keep tarantulas as pets "Pterinochilus murinus" is known as "OBT," which means "Orange Baboon Tarantula" or "Orange Bitey Thing," and also as the "Pterror," a pun on its Latin genus classification: "Pterinochilus". These nicknames reference a particular orange color form that is prized in the hobby for its beauty and confrontational personality. It is also known as the Mombasa golden starburst tarantula.
This species is incredibly defensive and should not be held. The bite of this species, while not serious, is extremely painful. Moreover, the species is more than willing to inflict such a bite before presenting the typical threat display. Caution when dealing with this species is advised.
Description.
Female "P. murinus" can grow to 4–6 inches in size (measured from the tip of the front left leg, to the rear right leg), while males typically range from 3–4 inches. The spider's abdomen, carapace, and legs have the same basic coloration, though the legs typically have brightly colored rings. The carapace has a star-shaped pattern, with a fishbone pattern present on the abdomen. The eyes are clustered together on a raised part of the carapace (in common with all tarantulas). The body is covered with short hairs, with longer hair present on the legs.
There are currently 4 known colour variants of "Pterinochilus murinus":
TCF - Typical Colour Form,
UMV - Usambara Mountain Variant,
RCF - Red Colour Form,
DCF - Dark Colour Form.
These colour variants are found in different geographical locations, and the colouration is thought to be related to the type of soil present where each variant lives.
Distribution.
The Orange Baboon spider is found in Angola, as well as Central, Southern, and Eastern Africa. The species has also been recorded on the island of Zanzibar.
Behavior.
Like most old world tarantulas, the Orange Baboon spider digs a burrow, or uses a burrow that has been abandoned. They lay silk threads on the entrance to feel vibrations from other animals. Also, it has lots of hairs on it that detect motion in the air. The Orange Baboon spider has no urticating hairs, and is very defensive. It also is not a good choice for pet owners that have recently started, and has a painful and venomous bite.
As pets.
These spiders are not common in pet stores but are very popular in the pet trade. They need a 5- to 10-gallon tank. These spiders build a tunnel shaped web and need 10 to 20 cm of bedding. Feed them crickets, cockroaches, and grasshoppers. Though they can kill small vertebrates (mice, small lizards, birds, snakes). Overfeeding can cause a tarantula's organs to not develop properly, thus cutting short its life. It is not recommended that this species be fed beetles and beetle larvae (superworms, mealworms, etc.)
These spiders are attractive but are normally very aggressive and have one of the worst bites of all tarantula species, having been known to have a bite more painful than that of a rattlesnake. Although their venom may not kill a human, it is advised to avoid handling this species.

Antonino Giuffrè

Antonino "Nino" Giuffrè (born July 21, 1945) is an Italian mafioso from Caccamo in the Province of Palermo, Sicily. He became one of the most important Mafia turncoats after his arrest in April 2002.
Giuffrè was known in mafia circles as "Manuzza" (the Hand), because his right hand was crippled by polio. Other sources claim he lost his hand in a hunting accident. Giuffrè was trained as an agricultural sciences specialist. His rise in the Mafia ran parallel to the ascension of the Corleonesi clan headed by Salvatore Riina. He became the head of the mandamento of Caccamo and is a nephew of American Mob Boss John Stanfa from Philadelphia.
Pentito.
Antonino Giuffrè was arrested on April 16, 2002. He started feeding investigators information even before he agreed to turn state' witness (or pentito) in June, 2002. He is one of the most important mafia turncoats since Tommaso Buscetta in 1984. His collaboration has updated investigators' knowledge and provided a new interpretation for the sensitive issue of Cosa Nostra's relations with politics in the early 1990s. ""It's very simple: we are the fish and politics is the water,"" Giuffrè said.
Giuffrè has an encyclopaedic knowledge of Cosa Nostra's affairs over the past two decades, partly from having played host to Michele Greco 'the Pope' in the 1980s, when the supreme mafia boss was on the run and took refuge near Caccamo, Giuffrè's home town. Subsequently he became one of the right-hand man of Bernardo Provenzano who became the Mafia’s reference point when Salvatore Riina was arrested in January 1993.
Giuffrè became part of the "directorate" that was established by Bernardo Provenzano, according to Antonio Ingroia, a leading anti-Mafia magistrate in Sicily. This group "of about four to seven people" met very infrequently, only when necessary, when there were strategic decisions to make. Among the other members of the directorate were Salvatore Lo Piccolo from Palermo; Benedetto Spera from Belmonte Mezzagno; Salvatore Rinella from Trabia; Giuseppe Balsano from Monreale; Matteo Messina Denaro from Castelvetrano; Vincenzo Virga from Trapani; and Andrea Manciaracina from Mazara del Vallo.
Division within Cosa Nostra.
Giuffrè supported Provenzano in his new strategy of moderation accompanied by the steady infiltration of public institutions instead of the head-on attacks of the past under Riina. He was practically unknown to investigators until the pentito Balduccio Di Maggio revealed in 1993 who Giuffrè really was. The same day the police raided his house in Caccamo, but Giuffrè managed to escape through the backdoor. He had been a fugitive since then.
In 2002 a rift within Cosa Nostra became clear. On the one hand there are the hardline Corleonesi in jail – led by Totò Riina and Leoluca Bagarella – and the more moderate "Palermitani" – led by Provenzano and Giuffrè, Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Matteo Messina Denaro. Apparently the arrest of Giuffrè was made possible by an anonymous phone call that seems to have been made by loyalists to the Mafia hardliners Riina and Bagarella. The purpose was to send a message to Provenzano. The incarcerated bosses want something to be done about the harsh prison conditions (in particular the relaxation of the article 41-bis prison regime) – and were believed to orchestrate a return to violence while serving multiple life sentences.
Mafia and Forza Italia.
According to Giuffrè the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana) — whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia’s fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when the DC strong man in Sicily, Salvo Lima, was killed in March, 1992. "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," Giuffrè told the court. "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia."
According to Giuffrè, Marcello Dell'Utri — Berlusconi’s right-hand man and the man who invented Forza Italia — was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mobsters in exchange for electoral support. Giuffrè said that Bernardo Provenzano told him that they "were in good hands" with Dell'Utri, who was a "serious and trustworthy person" and was close to Berlusconi. ""Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very good contact point for Berlusconi"," Giuffrè said. Provenzano said that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.
Giuffrè said that Silvio Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with Stefano Bontade, a top Mafia boss, in the mid-1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire (Berlusconi became prime minister in 1994 and again from 2001 to 2006). Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore. Bontade’s contact at Berlusconi's villa was the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted mafioso who has been alleged to work there as a stableman. Giuffrè declared that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo bosses Filippo Graviano and Giuseppe Graviano — arrested in 1994 and jailed for life ordering the murder of Anti-mafia priest Pino Puglisi in their territory Brancaccio.
The alleged pact with the Mafia fell apart in 2002. Cosa Nostra had achieved nothing. There were no revisions of Mafia trials, no changes in the law of asset seizures and no changes in the harsh prison laws (41 bis).
Andreotti and Calvi.
Antonio Giuffrè has been a state witness in many important trials. He told an Italian court that former prime minister Giulio Andreotti was a key Mafia contact during his long political career. Giuffrè said Mafia bosses had asked Andreotti to shield them from magistrates.
Giuffrè is also giving testimony in the Roberto Calvi murder trial. He claims that Mafia bosses had been angry at the way Calvi had mishandled their money and ordered the hit. He named Giuseppe Calò as the man who organised the crime. "Within Cosa Nostra, we had some big laughs when we read in the newspapers that Calvi had committed suicide," Giuffrè said. "Cosa Nostra's problems get resolved in only one way: by elimination."
According to Giuffrè, the Mafia plotted to kill Giuseppe Lumia while he was the president of the Parliamentary Antimafia Commission (2000–2001). The plan to kill Lumia was decided at the very highest level of Cosa Nostra and had been approved by Provenzano. It was not carried out, however.

FATF blacklist

The FATF blacklist was the common shorthand description for the Financial Action Task Force list of "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs); i.e., countries which it perceived to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for offshore financial centres (or "tax havens") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as offshore financial centres. The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, designating countries to be added or deleted.
The term "non-cooperative" was sometimes criticized as misleading, as a number of the countries which appeared on the list simply lacked the infrastructure or resources to cope with relatively sophisticated financial criminals who try to operate there. Since 2008 the FATF has, at the behest of G20 leaders, installed a more analytical process of identifying jurisdictions deficient in their anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing regimes.

FATF Public Statement - 14 February 2014
Paris, 14 February 2014 - The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is the global standard setting body for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In order to protect the international financial system from money laundering and financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risks and to encourage greater compliance with the AML/CFT standards, the FATF identified jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies and works with them to address those deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.
Jurisdictions subject to a FATF call on its members and other jurisdictions to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the on-going and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/FT) risks emanating from the jurisdictions.
Jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan developed with the FATF to address the deficiencies. The FATF calls on its members to consider the risks arising from the deficiencies associated with each jurisdiction, as described below.
Kenya and Tanzania are now identified in the FATF document, "Improving Global AML/CFT Compliance: On-going Process" due to their progress in substantially addressing their action plan agreed upon with the FATF
November 2013.
A total of 15 countries were identified as jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.

History of the FATF blacklist (NCCT jurisdictions).
http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd
June 2000 report.
The plenary list, consisting of fifteen countries regarded as uncooperative in the fight against money laundering, was published in June 2000, viz:
The initial list met much criticism from professionals experienced in the offshore financial sector. The designation of the Cayman Islands as non-cooperative was thought to be harsh, particularly as the 2000 report itself acknowledged that "the Cayman Islands has been a leader in developing anti-money laundering programmes throughout the Caribbean region. It has served as president of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and it has provided substantial assistance to neighbouring states in the region. It has demonstrated cooperation on criminal law enforcement matters, and uncovered several serious cases of fraud and money laundering otherwise unknown to authorities in FATF member states."
June 2001 report.
The second FATF report, published in 2001 and including a supplemental report in September, denoted a further eight countries as non-cooperative:
June 2006 report.
The seventh list, published in June 2006, listed only the following country as non-cooperative:
June 2007 report.
FATF's Eighth NCCT Review (Annual Review of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories 2006–2007, dated 12 October 2007) listed no countries as non-cooperative. Myanmar (formerly Burma) was removed on 13 October 2006, Nauru on 13 October 2005 and Nigeria on 23 June 2006.
June 2009 report.
FATF issued a "Statement" on 25 February 2009 noting concerns and encouraging greater compliance by the following countries:
OECD "gray list".
Although its main focus is on tax crime, the OECD is also concerned with money laundering. Its work is designed to complement that carried out by the FATF. The OECD maintains a 'blacklist' of countries it considers uncooperative in the drive for transparency of tax affairs and the effective exchange of information, officially called "The List of Uncooperative Tax Havens". As of December 2009, no country is officially listed as a tax haven by the OECD.
On 22 October 2008, at an OECD meeting in Paris, 17 countries led by France and Germany decided to draw up a new blacklist of tax havens. The OECD has been asked to investigate around 40 new tax havens where undeclared revenue is allegedly hidden and which host many of the non-regulated hedge funds that came under fire during the 2008 financial crisis. Germany, France, and other countries called on the OECD to add Switzerland to a blacklist of countries which encourage tax fraud.
The OECD gray list reports monitor the implementation of the internationally agreed tax standard in select jurisdictions – tax havens or other financial centers of interest. The list of jurisdictions is divided in three parts.
Global forum compliance.
The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes reviews and issues reports on compliance of its member tax jurisdictions. The Global Forum's peer review process examines both the legal and regulatory aspects of exchange (Phase 1 reviews) and the exchange of information in practice (Phase 2).
As of November 2011 the phase one or combined (phases 1&2) reviews of 59 jurisdictions have been completed. The final phase two review is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2014.
Of the completed reviews, the following jurisdictions are not ready for phase two: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Botswana, Brunei, Liechtenstein, Panama, Seychelles, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Vanuatu.

Georgia State Route 371

State Route 371 (SR 371) is a two-lane south-to-north state highway in unincorporated Forsyth County in the north-central part of the U.S. state of Georgia. The route connects SR 9 in the south to SR 20 in the north. SR 371 serves as a connecting route for the residential neighborhoods between SR 9 and SR 20 to SR 400, the major south–north commuter route into and out of Atlanta. SR 371 is known locally as Post Road.
Route description.
SR 371 begins at an intersection with SR 9 (Atlanta Highway) northeast of Milton and first travels slightly to the northeast, then bends mostly north through the residential southwestern portion of Forsyth County, before reaching its northern terminus at SR 20 (Canton Highway) near the community of Ducktown. The area around the southern terminus of the route features Alpharetta mailing addresses, with the majority of the route located in the 30040 ZIP code.
While the short route has little statewide significance, it does serve as an important connector for local traffic in the area, as well as serving as a part of the commuter feeder route to SR 400. SR 371 is also utilized as a major school traffic connector for students of all ages, as both Vickery Creek Elementary School and Vickery Creek Middle School are located on the route itself, and West Forsyth High School is just off the route on Kelly Mill Road.
The Georgia Department of Transportation annual average daily traffic (AADT) numbers for the year 2011 show an average of 14,490 vehicles using the southern portion of the route (between SR 9 and Kelly Mill Road) on a daily basis, with 97% of this traffic made up by personal vehicles.
History.
The route makes its first appearance on Georgia highway maps in 1944, and SR 371 is signed as an extension of SR 141 from where SR 141 left its concurrency with US 19 and SR 9 and ran north to SR 20. From 1944, the route is shown as graded, but not yet surfaced. It was 1957 before the route, still signed as SR 141, is marked as having been finished with a hard surface. In 1972, the route was signed as SR 371.

Georgia State Route 370

State Route 370 (SR 370) is a south–north state highway located entirely within Early County in the southwestern part of the state of Georgia. It runs parallel to the Chattahoochee River for its entire length. The southern-most is part of the Blakely Highway. The rest of the highway is known as Great Southern Highway. The roadway's construction was began in the early 1960s. Later that decade, the Blakely Highway section was included as part of former SR 363. In 1970, the road was designated as SR 370.
Route description.
SR 370 begins at an intersection with US 84/SR 38 (Hugh D. Broome, Sr. Parkway) northwest of Jaken. Approximately north-northwest of the southern terminus, SR 370 intersects the western terminus of SR 273 (Paper Mill Parkway) and the eastern terminus of SR 273 Spur. Finally, the route curves to a nearly due north routing and meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 62 (Columbia Highway) in Hilton.
SR 370 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.
History.
The road that would eventually become SR 370 was built between 1960 and 1963 from its current southern terminus to approximately north of that. In 1967, this entire segment was designated as part of SR 363. In 1970, SR 370 was designated along its current length from approximately north of its current southern terminus to its current northern terminus. It is unclear if it ran concurrent with SR 363 south of the southern end of the segment. Between 1984 and 1986, SR 363 was decommissioned. Therefore, SR 370 ran along its current length.

Ralph Graham

Ralph Mevlin Graham (1910 – October 14, 2005) was an American football, basketball, and tennis player and coach. He served as the head football coach at University of Wichita, now Wichita State University, in 1942 and from 1946 to 1947, and at Kansas State University from 1948 to 1950, compiling a career college football record of 21–39–1.
Playing career.
Graham, a native of El Dorado, Kansas, played football at Kansas State University under head coach Bo McMillin. Known as "Rammin' Ralph", he was a first team All-Big Six Conference fullback each year from 1931 to 1933. He nearly led K-State to the Rose Bowl in 1931 before getting injured. Following his senior season, Graham was a starter in the East–West Shrine Game, becoming the first Kansas State football player to be named to an all-star game. Graham graduated as the all-time leading scorer at Kansas State, and held that record for 64 years until it was surpassed by kicker Martín Gramática in 1997.
Coaching career.
Upon graduation in 1934, Graham entered the football coaching profession as an assistant to McMillin, who moved from Kansas State to Indiana University that season. Graham remained an assistant football and basketball coach at Indiana until 1942, where he also earned a master's degree and was head coach of the tennis team. During this time, Graham was the top assistant for Branch McCracken's 1940 national championship basketball team.
Wichita.
Graham returned to Kansas in 1942 to serve as athletics director and head football coach at the University of Wichita, now Wichita State University. During his first season as head coach, Graham led Wichita to a 5–4 record, including a win over his alma mater. After taking the next three seasons off to serve in World War II, Graham returned to Wichita to coach two more successful seasons in 1946 and 1947. Following the 1947 season he led Wichita to the Raisin Bowl, played on January 1, 1948.
Graham was the 18th head coach for the Shockers. His overall coaching record at Wichita was 17 wins and 13 losses. This ranks him fifth at Wichita in terms of total wins and 11th at the school in terms of winning percentage.
Kansas State.
In the wake of his success at Wichita, Graham was hired as the 22nd head football coach at Kansas State in 1948. At the time he took the job, K-State was mired in a 26-game losing streak, the longest in NCAA history to that point. Graham managed to break the streak with a win in his third game. (The full 28-game streak is still the second longest in NCAA history.) In his second season, Graham started 2–0 and Kansas State beat Colorado in the second to snap a 22-game conference losing streak. However, the season fell apart after that point and the team finished 2–8. After coaching one more season, and posting a 1–9 record, Graham resigned from Kansas State following the 1950 season with a 4–26–1 mark during his tenure. Notably, the situation Graham inherited at Kansas State was so bad that this record represented an improvement over the prior three seasons. During his years at Kansas State, Graham also coached the school's tennis team.
Following his years at Kansas State, Graham left the field of athletics.
Racial integration.
Graham was a pioneer in integrating collegiate athletics in the region. While at Kansas State he supported African American Harold Robinson in his football career and awarded him an athletic scholarship. Robinson broke the decades-long "color barrier" in the Big Seven Conference playing for Graham in 1949. Robinson later compared Graham to Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who hired Jackie Robinson to integrate baseball in 1947. Integration was also a priority at Wichita, where one of Graham's best players was also African American—running back Linwood Sexton.

Tears of the Prophets

"Tears of the Prophets" is the 26th and final episode of the of the American science fiction television series "", the 150th episode overall. It was first broadcast in broadcast syndication within the United States on June 17, 1998. It was written by Ira Steven Behr and Hans Beimler, and directed by Allan Kroeker. The episode featured the death of Jadzia Dax and the final appearance of actress Terry Farrell in the show.
Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet-managed Bajoran space station "Deep Space Nine". In this episode, the Federation decide to move on the offensive against the Dominion. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is warned by the prophets not to leave the station, but decides to ignore their warning. As Starfleet attack a Cardassian star system, Dukat (Marc Alaimo), possessed by a Pah-wraith, arrives at the station. He mortally wounds Lt Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) and disables the Bajoran wormhole. After Dax's death, Sisko declares that he is leaving the station and returning to Earth.
The premise of the attack on the wormhole originated as a plan to end the seventh season of "DS9", and was again suggested for the end of season six when planning began for that season. The imminent departure of Farrell, who elected not to renew her contract, caused problems for the writers as they sought to include both elements into the episode. The episode raised themes of revenge and the conflict between military service and religion. Although the critical review was positive and the episode received a high level of press coverage due to the publicized death of Jadzia Dax, it was viewed by only 4.1 million viewers in the first broadcast, the joint-lowest figures for the season.
Plot.
Admiral Ross (Barry Jenner) informs Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) that Starfleet intends to go on the offensive in the war against the Dominion and intends to move to invade Cardassia. They evaluate the plans and decide to move against the Chin'toka star system. Meanwhile Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Lt Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) discuss their plans to have a baby with Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). Both Bashir and Quark (Armin Shimerman) mourn the fact that it means that Worf and Dax's marriage is solid and neither have a chance with her. They both visit the holosuite to see Vic Fontaine (James Darren) who counsels them on their loss. Sisko meets with General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) and the Romulans to discuss the plans for Chin'toka and discover that they need to attack immediately as the Cardassian-Dominion are about to improve the defences. The night before the attack, Sisko receives a vision from the prophets, who warn him not to leave the station. Sisko tells Ross about the vision, who responds that he must decide between his duty to Starfleet and the prophets.
Meanwhile, the Cardassian leader, Damar (Casey Biggs), receives intelligence about the Starfleet movements towards Chin'toka and orders his troops to speed up the deployment of weapon platforms in the system. Dukat (Marc Alaimo) arrives and discloses his plan to allow one of the enemies of the Prophets, the Pah-wraiths, to possess him. He reveals a Bajoran artefact, which he breaks. A red mist swirls around him and he is possessed by a Pah-wraith. The combined fleet arrives at Chin'toka just as the weapons platforms are activated. As the fleet is being destroyed, on board the USS "Defiant", Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) informs Sisko that the platforms can be taken offline if they find and destroy the central power source.
They discover it on a nearby moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but he hits her with bolts of energy from his hands and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his old self, apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the "Defiant" are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole is gone and all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says that he was able to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long enough to say goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth. He departs with his son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), leaving Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in charge of "DS9".
Production.
The concept of the attack on the prophets themselves had been first raised in a discussion between Rick Berman and Ira Steven Behr, and was suggested as a potential ending to a seventh series. When plans for season six were first discussed in September 1997, it was suggested once more. Screenwriter René Echevarria said that they wanted Sisko to suffer a setback, which featured an attack by the Dominion on the prophets. The idea was raised that the plot would follow on from those in the episode "". In that episode, a prophet and a pah-wraith each possess a person and battle on the station before being forced out of their hosts leaving a prophecy unfulfilled. It was that prophecy which the writers intended to follow up with "Tears of the Prophets".
"Tears of the Prophets" was the final episode of "Deep Space Nine" to feature actress Terry Farrell. Her contract on the show was set to expire after the sixth season and she elected not to sign a new contract for a further season. The day after her final scene was shot, she tested for the sitcom "Becker". She later said that she would have been happy with a recurring role during the seventh series of "Deep Space Nine" as she was tired of the long hours required of her in a main cast role. The writers felt that due to the ongoing Dominion War in the series, that there was no alternative other than to kill off the character. Farrell said of the exit of her character, "I don't feel cheated out of the character in the same way as I would have if the show had been cancelled, because I've gotten the opportunity to play her. And besides, it's Jadzia that's dying. Dax is living."
The departure of Farrell caused problems for the writers, as they initially were not sure how to combine their original vision for the final episode of season six, and include a suitable tribute to the character of Jadzia Dax. The initial plan had Dukat stealing an orb of the prophets, and intends to destroy it inside the wormhole. As with the final episode, Sisko and the "Defiant" were not at the station, but Jadzia had remained behind. She would have pursued Dukat into the wormhole and somehow died in the process. But it was the manner of the death which caused problems for the writers as they wanted something suitably heroic but not clichéd. In the first draft script by Hans Beimler and Behr, which was entitled "Tears of the Gods", Jadzia was killed by Dukat but managed to save the prophets in the process. Creative consultant Michael Piller felt that Jadzia's death was not a "worthy send-off" and felt rushed. The scene where Jadzia says goodbye to Worf was added, and Echevarria encouraged showing Jadzia dying on screen.
There were concerns about the number of steps required by Dukat to attack the wormhole, and it was Ron Moore who suggested the inclusion of the pah-wraiths once more. Echevarria then raised the idea of having Dukat possessed, as seen with Kira and Jake Sisko in "The Reckoning". The scene with Worf at the end of the episode was kept, and a death chant was written initially in English based upon the Native American chant "Only the Earth endures". It was subsequently translated into Klingon for the script, but Behr thought it was a shame that the audience would not be able to understand the meaning behind the words. The scene with Sisko and Jadzia's coffin was shot on a closed set, with Avery Brooks being the only actor on set in order to give a sense of intimacy to the proceedings.
They added the sense of acknowledging Sisko's failure because of the perceived reduction in the impact of the destruction of the prophets after the death of Jadzia. Brooks said of the scene that "I know about loss. It's one of the things that we experience as part of living, part of the consequences of living", but also said that the emotions were enhanced because they were going to miss Farrell. Whilst on set there was a suggestion by set director Laura Richarz that the coffin was the same prop as used for the photon torpedo which Spock's body was loaded into in ', Mike Okuda later explained that several new torpedo props were made for ' and so they could not be sure if the Spock torpedo was the one used or not.
Themes.
The episode deals with the themes of revenge in the case of Dukat, and also the conflicting nature of religion and military duty with Sisko. Dukat had been present on the station in the episode "Sacrifice of Angels" when it was retaken by the fleet of the Federation-Klingon alliance, and suffered a nervous breakdown following the death of his daughter Tora Ziyal. In the episode "", he escapes from Federation custody whilst en route to a trial for war crimes and vows revenge against Sisko and Bajor.
Reception and home media release.
"Tears of the Prophets" was first broadcast on June 13, 1998 in broadcast syndication within the United States. It received Nielsen ratings of 4.1 million. This placed it in fifteenth place in the timeslot, and was one of the least viewed episodes of the first season during the initial broadcast along with the previous episode "The Sound of Her Voice". Prior to the broadcast of the episode, there had been a great deal of publicity due to the imminent death of Jadzia Dax, which had not been held back as a surprise. The advertisements placed in magazines alluded to the fact, and the story had been picked up by the national press. Farrell's subsequent casting on "Becker" was also covered, as was her replacement by Nicole de Boer for the seventh and final season as Ezri Dax.
Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Michelle Erica Green called the episode "an episode of mythic proportion, with a tour de force performance by Avery Brooks" in her review for TrekNation. She praised the plot in the episode saying that "what Sisko really did was choose tactics over intuition, or perhaps intellect over spirituality...and it was the wrong choice. This is a stunning moment for Star Trek: an acknowledgement that there are forces in the universe which cannot be coerced, manipulated, or (as in the case of Q and the Organians) talked into submission by Starfleet captains." She hoped that the repercussions from the episode would lead into the seventh series. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website "Jammer's Reviews" thought that the episode took a while to get to the point, but then it delivered, using the death of Jadzia in a way to drop Sisko "into an abyss of despair". He thought that the melodrama in Jadzia's pregnancy and subsequent death was exaggerated, and that the manner of the death was random, but the context of the effects of Jadzia's death and the funeral scene "really works". While he was pleased with some of the characterizations in the episode, such as Jeffrey Combs as Weyoun, he felt that the scene with Quark and Bashir was unnecessary. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.
The first home media release of "Tears of the Prophets" was as a two episode VHS cassette alongside "The Sound of Her Voice" in the United Kingdom on December 28, 1998. It was later released on DVD in the United States and Canada as part of the season six box set on November 4, 2003.

<doc id="5967843" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967843" title="George Perles">
George Perles

George J. Perles (born July 16, 1934) is a former American football player and coach. He was a defensive line coach, defensive coordinator, and assistant head coach for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers from 1972–1982 and the head coach at Michigan State University from 1983–1994. Perles was elected to the MSU Board of Trustees in 2006.
Early years.
Perles was born in Detroit, Michigan on July 16, 1934. The only child of Julius and Nellie Perles, George grew up in Detroit and attended Western High School. Upon graduating, Perles and 17 of his high school friends jointly enlisted in the U.S. Army.
Michigan State.
After returning from active duty, Perles returned to Michigan where he enrolled at Michigan State University and played football under legendary coach Duffy Daugherty. Perles played the 1958 season before his playing career was cut short by a knee injury. Perles then started his football coaching career as a graduate assistant at Michigan State before moving on to the high school ranks in Chicago and Detroit, where his St. Ambrose High School team won their first Detroit City League Championship in 1961. Perles returned to Michigan State as defensive line coach under his mentor, Daugherty.
Pittsburgh Steelers.
In 1972, Chuck Noll, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, reviewed dozens of resumes and interviewed numerous candidates before deciding to offer Perles the position of defensive line coach. In Perles’ first season, the Steelers made the NFL playoffs for the second time in franchise history, the first since 1947, losing to the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game.
In 1974, the Steelers won the first of six consecutive AFC Central division championships and also their first Super Bowl. Perles became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers in 1978 and then assistant head coach under Noll in 1979. During Perles' ten years with Pittsburgh (1972–1982), the Steelers won a then-unprecedented four Super Bowls and became known as the team of the decade for the 1970s, largely on the back of their "Stunt 4-3" defense designed by Perles.
USFL.
In 1982, Perles was hired as the head coach of the Philadelphia Stars of the fledgling United States Football League (USFL). Perles worked for one year with the Stars during the development and formation of the league and the team, but broke his contract with the team prior to the start of the first season when he was offered the Michigan State head football coaching position. The Stars sued MSU for interfering with Perles's contract the case was settled out of court.
Return to Michigan State.
Perles returned to Michigan State University on December 3, 1982. In 12 years, he led the Spartans to two Big Ten Conference titles and seven bowl games. His best team was the 1987 unit, which won Michigan State's last outright conference title in the pre-championship game era and defeated USC in the 1988 Rose Bowl. 
NCAA sanctions.
During 1994–1995, an extensive external investigation conducted by the law firm of Bond, Schoeneck & King, PLLC. uncovered various infractions including grade tampering by an athletic department administrator. MSU president M. Peter McPherson fired Perles before the end of the 1994 season, and ordered the Spartans to forfeit their five wins for that season, resulting in Michigan State's second official winless season of the modern era. If not for the forfeited games, Perles would be the second-winningest coach in MSU history behind only his former boss, Daugherty.
In 1996, the NCAA accepted MSU's self-imposed sanctions and added additional penalties, including the loss of six football scholarships for 1996. While the NCAA found there was "lack of institutional control" within the football program during Perles' tenure, it cleared him of wrongdoing.
After coaching.
Motor City Bowl.
In 1995, Perles and former Michigan State University Sports Information Director, Ken Hoffman, founded and initiated the Motor City Bowl, a collegiate football bowl game in Detroit. In 2007, the Motor City Bowl enjoyed a record crowd of more than 63,000 people in its 11th game with Perles as chief executive officer and Hoffman as executive director.
MSU Board of Trustees.
In November 2006, Perles was elected as a Democrat to the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University. He began serving an eight-year term beginning January 1, 2007.
In May 2007, the MSU Board of Trustees voted to name the plaza adjacent to the Duffy Daugherty Football Building the George J. Perles and Sally A. Perles Plaza in honor of the couple’s $500,000 donation.

Hu Zongnan

Hu Zongnan (; 16 May 1896–14 February 1962), courtesy name Shoushan (壽山), native of Zhenhai, Ningbo. A general in the National Revolutionary Army and then the Republic of China Army. Together with Chen Cheng and Tang Enbo, he formed the triumvirate of Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted generals during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949, Hu served as the President's military strategy advisor until his death in 1962.
Campaigns against warlords.
Hu was in the first graduating class of Whampoa Military Academy (1924). One of Chiang Kai-shek's favourite students, he took part in the Northern Expedition as CO of 2nd Regiment, 1st Division, First Army. In May 1927 he was promoted to deputy CO of 1st Division while retaining command of 2nd Regiment. In November of the same year he was assigned as CO of the 22nd Division and led the division during the second Northern Expedition in April 1928. In August his division was downsized to the 2nd Brigade of 1st Division, and he served as CO of this brigade which Chiang thought highly of. In 1929 and 1930 he led his brigade in the Central Plains War to defend the central government against the regional warlords such as the Gui clique, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan. He was promoted and given command of a reorganised 1st Division upon his return. [http://www.mnd.gov.tw/English/]
He participated in Chiang's communist extermination campaigns, was given command of First Army in 1936, and took part in the Battle of Shanghai and Wuhan, variously leading the Seventeenth Army, 34th Army Group, 8th Military Region and 1st Military Region. Hu proved himself in these battles and along with Tang Enbai, Xue Yue, and others, Hu became one of the Kuomintang generals his enemy deeply feared and respected. However, Hu's glory on the battlefields was short-lived, and much to the delight of his Japanese enemy, Hu nearly vanished after these battles and rarely participated in the rest of war because he was put in charge of more than 400,000 Kuomintang troops by Chiang Kai-shek to blockade the communist base in Shaanxi. Hu Zongnan would have preferred to die for his country on the battlefields fighting the Japanese invaders, even the communist agents infiltrated his inner circle would have to admit that Hu had shown his eagerness to fight the Japanese from time to time, but as a professional soldier, he dutifully carried out his order given by Chiang Kai-shek by staying at this job for the rest of war.
During this time, Hu's rivalry with Chen Cheng continued while his friendship with Dai Li deepened, leading to Hu's engagement to Ye Xiadi (叶霞翟), who was a Juntong agent working under Dai Li and was introduced to Hu by Dai. Hu and Ye eventually married in 1948, when Hu was 52, almost two decade to Ye's senior.
Resumption of the Chinese Civil War.
After World War II, Hu Zongnan battled the Communist Party of China and in the early stage of the struggle, was once successful in taking Yan'an, the capital of the communist base in Shaanxi. However, Hu was unable to achieve any further significant victories because out of the original 400,000 troops he once commanded for most part of the war, a great portion was transferred to other commands after the war, leaving only 250,000 for Hu himself at the time. It was rumored that Hu's rivalries within Kuomintang around Chiang Kai-shek such as Chen Cheng were jealous of him and convinced Chiang to reduce Hu's power. With the death of his close ally Dai Li, there was nobody to defend Hu Zongnan in front of Chiang, and since Hu himself was in the distant land in the remote corner of China busy fighting the communists, he could not abandon his job and go to Chiang to explain himself in the political infighting within the Kuomintang. Although Hu Zongnan was a capable commander, he was nonetheless not a match for his communist opponent Peng Dehuai, and with the absolute numerical and technical superiorities, Hu's a quarter million troops not only failed to defeat the communist Peng Dehuai's 20,000 strong force, but after their initial success, also continuously suffered numerous defeats that greatly reduced Hu's strength. The loss of his troops was so great that in March 1950, when Hu retreated to Taiwan, he was by himself and did not have any troops left.
However, it must be said that Hu's defeat had much more to do to his political personality than his military capability. More importantly, Chiang Kai-shek's overconfidence, political zeal and infatuation with holding on to the land conquered like that of Hitler's also contributed greatly to Kuomintang's failure. The rugged terrain of the northwestern China favored the communists defenders and their guerrilla warfare and not suitable for the mechanized nationalist troops, a large number of which was needed to defend the newly captured regions. During Hu Zongnan's initial success, he was able to overrun the communists base in Shaanxi and forced the communists to evacuate most of their governmental bodies to the east of the Yellow River at a cost of merely losing 20,000 troops out of a quarter million total in the process, but in order to guard the newly conquered vast regions, the nationalist troops were dangerously overstretched and spread thin. For example, it would take 80,000 troops to capture and guard Yan'an, the former communist capital in Shaanxi, but the political symbolism was simple too much for Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to forsake, and as a result, the political zeal overrode the military practicality. Hu Zongnan was aided by Ma Clique Muslim cavalry when seizing Yan'an.
Another lethal curse on Hu Zongnan and his troops was Chiang Kai-shek's infatuation with holding on to the conquered land: the regions was simply too large and too rugged to be guarded by any relatively small but highly mobile mechanizied force, and thus a large number of troops must be stationed in the geographically isolated regions to guard these regions. The reasons that such a great force was needed were that the communists main force was not damaged in anyway during the nationalist campaigns and was still able to launch assaults on the nationalists, and Chiang Kai-shek's overconfidence caused him to believe that the 20,000 strong communist main force engaged in guerrilla warfare in its former base was not a threat, which proved to be fatally wrong. In order to achieve what Chiang had wished, a force much larger than 400,000 were needed, and 230,000 troops Hu had under his command certainly was not enough to do the job.
The American TIME magazine claimed Hu beat his chest like Tarzan when he was frustrated or angry. In March, 1948, at Ichuan Peng Dehuai led Communist forces to luanch a surise attack against Hu Zongnan's forces, influcting 20,000 casualties upon them, and drove all the way with 60,000 soldiers into southern Shanxi province to reach Sichuan, General Hu requested immediate help from Muslim Governor Ma Hongkui, who sent two Muslim cavalry divisions. They defeated the Communist forces at Pao-chi and inflicted 20,000 dead upon the Communists, expelling them into Gansu.
In 1949 the entire Kuomintang defences were falling apart. General Hu Zongnan ignored President Li Zongren's orders, and the Muslim General Ma Hongkui was furious at this. Hu also did not honor promises to Ma Honkui and the other Muslim Ma Clique Generals. Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Li Zongren to submit his resignation from all positions he held, then Ma Hongkui fled to Taiwan, and his cousin Ma Hongbin took charge of his positions.
Legacy.
Hu Zongnan, as a capable military commander was not unaware of these problems the nationalists had faced, but as a loyal subject of this superior, Hu could not challenge Chiang Kai-shek, especially when such actions would provide the false impression of him being holding and expanding his own power, leading the way to become a new warlord, since he was already been called the Northwestern King not only by the communists, but also his rivalries within the Kuomintang itself. Therefore Hu faithfully obeyed his orders given by Chiang Kai-shek and did not any opposition when his force was drastically reduced even though it needed to be greatly boosted if Chiang Kai-shek's intentions to be carried out, and eventually ended up in the inevitable defeats: it was merely after losing only a little more than 13,000 troops out of the total 230,000 in the three battles, the nationalists offensives in the former communist base had effectively ended because there was not enough troops to guard every newly conquered region and launching assaults on the communist main force at the same time. The communists were able to rest and regroup after these three battles and capitalize on this stalemate, eventually turning the table on the nationalist by decimating the Kuomintang force gradually, one small chunk at a time. Although Chiang Kai-shek would sent Hu Zongnan reinforcement which was eventually greater than what Hu had commanded during World War II, it did not help Hu's situation because such reinforcement was sent in small numbers one at a time, thus a decisive blow to the communist main force could not launched with numerical and technical superiority in a single strike. In contrast, the communists were able to concentrate their force to launch decisive blows to every nationalist garrison they engaged every time by achieving numerical superiority, taking out the Kuomintang units gradually. Hu Zongnan's failure was large not due to his military capability, but he was blamed by his rivals afterward. Another reason for Hu's failure was because that his most trusted assistant, Major General Xiong Xianghui was a communist spy. Xiong secretly joined communist party in December 1936 at Tsinghua University and under the direct order of Zhou Enlai, Xiong went to work for Hu Zongnan in December 1937. Xiong excelled in his work and since March 1939, he had become Hu's most trusted subordinate and named Xiong his secretary, a position Xiong held until May, 1947, when he was sent to USA by Hu Zongnan to study. It was not after Xiong left Hu did Hu discovered Xiong's true identity, and obviously, it was not Hu Zongnan's fault and Hu himself was fooled and thus a victim as well, but Hu's political enemy, such as those in Chen Cheng's camp, accused him of harboring communists, a charge later resurfaced after the nationalist had withdrawn to Taiwan, and Hu was cleared for both times. After the KMT fled to Taiwan, he served as governor of Zhejiang (Chekiang) from 1952, commanded the ROC defense in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis and retired from the army in 1955. He went on to serve as the President's military strategy advisor until his death on 14 February 1962. [http://www.generals.dk/]

Gianfranco Ferré

Gianfranco Ferré () (15 August 1944 – 17 June 2007) was a fashion designer also known as "the architect of fashion" for his background and his original attitude toward creating fashion design.
Background.
Born in Legnano, Italy, he received a degree in architecture in 1969 at the Politecnico di Milano university.
Ferré began his fashion career in 1970 by designing accessories, then worked as a raincoat designer in 1972-74. He started his own company Baila in 1974 and launched his signature collection for women in 1978. His first men's collection appeared in 1982, followed in 1986 by his first couture collection in Rome.
Ferré became Stylistic Director of Christian Dior in Paris in 1989, when he was chosen by owner Bernard Arnault to replace Marc Bohan. In 1996, it was announced that Ferré would end his engagement with Dior with the Spring 1997 collection for the label.
His own label is more relaxed and pared-down than Dior. Sophisticated white shirts have become the symbol of his personal signature in fashion design.
Ferré appeared to be extremely critical of trends and fashion gimmicks. He dealt with his demanding schedule, being responsible for a French top fashion brand and his own Italian label, by commuting between Milan and Paris in his private plane. Ferré had a lakeside home in Lake Maggiore, near Milan. 
Awards.
Ferré won a number of prestigious awards including the L'Occhio d'Oro during his career:
Economic data.
Ownership.
The Gianfranco Ferré S.p.A. is the holding company that coordinates the fashion business of the Ferré label. It was owned by Gianfranco Ferré (Creative Director) and Franco Mattioli (Chief Financial Officer) in equal shares until it was sold to IT Holdings in March 2002. Recently, Ferré announced that the group plans to become listed at the Milan stock exchange. In order to prepare for this movement Ferré started to rearrange the holding significantly. First step was the recruitment of experienced management personnel under the guide of Giuseppe Cipriano. Next step is the reduction of the number of subsidiaries from today 21 to four or five in the future. Another move is the acquisition of the apparel producer Dei Mattioli, which is owned by Franco Mattioli. Ferré also seems to be interested in acquiring some of his contractors, in order to have more control over the production.
Performance.
The company achieved total sales of 950 billion Lira ($589 million) in 1994, an increase of 15% over 1993, which had shown enjoyed a similar increase over 1992 sales. Ferré's 14 licences contributed 58% to total sales in 1994. In 1996, total sales were already at 1250 billion Lira ($811 million).
Exports.
70% of Ferré sales are achieved in export, where the US appears to be the biggest market with growing importance. Italy still holds 20% of the sales, but the success of the Ferré Jeans business in the US seems to shift the focus here. The Studio .0001 by Ferré line, produced by Italian garment manufacturer Marzotto, is basically targeted at the US market.
Distribution.
Ferré distributes in 17 exclusive boutiques worldwide (1994) and has over 250 sales points in total.
Production/licenses.
Though no longer under production, the Studio .0001 and Forma O were produced by Marzotto, one of the biggest Italian garment manufacturers. The sportswear collections Oaks by Ferré and Ferrejeans used to be manufactured by Italiana Manifatture S.p.A., but Ferré contracted those lines for the next ten years to Ittiere, who also furnish the bride collections of Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and others. The range of licenced products is wide, including shoes, stationery, luggage, home furnishings, and perfumes. The latest addition to this list is the license given to the Swiss watch manufacturer Swatch.
Most of the external licenses were eliminated in 2003, leaving only the Gianfranco Ferre mainline, Ferre diffusion, and GF Ferre younger/activewear labels.
Death.
Ferré died on June 17, 2007. The previous Friday, he had suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. Ferré was hospitalized at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, where he was pronounced dead a few days later.

<doc id="5967870" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967870" title="Serra da Estrela Natural Park">
Serra da Estrela Natural Park

Serra da Estrela Natural Park is situated in the largest mountain range in Portugal - the Serra da Estrela, and is the source of the rivers Mondego, Zêzere (tributary of the Tagus), and Alva. The park is the largest natural conservation area in Portugal and occupies about 1,000 km². More than half of its area is located above an altitude of 700 m. At 1,993 m it contains the highest peak in Continental Portugal (named Torre) and a ski resort (named Vodafone Ski Resort).
During the Quaternary period, the entire region was subjected to the action of ice and once this disappeared visible marks were left on the landscape. Valleys in the shape of horseshoes, ravines, polished rocks and lakes of glacial origin are just some of the formations that demonstrate the importance of the ice and snow in modelling the mountains.
Geography.
The central plateau, dominated by the 7 m "Torre" (Tower) and "Cântaros", location of the glacial valley of the Zêzere, contrasts with another mountain, the Videmonte plateau, which is still in the initial bed of the Mondego, dotted with isolated farms among fields of rye and pastures where cattle are bred. In the valleys to the south west, decorated by terraces and surrounded by the "Penha dos Abutres", are the villages of Loriga and Alvoco, which have developed on powerful rocky spurs. Finally, the north west slope stretches from below Seia to the land dominated by the castle of Linhares and the fields where maize is cultivated and vines are planted up the slopes to where the broom grows.
Fauna.
In terms of fauna, the presence of the bear is a thing of the past and even wolves only roam here sporadically. In addition to the wall lizard that is a feature of the region, other species include otters, genets, badgers, wild cats, water moles, red breasted bullfinches, Algerian wall lizards and midwife frogs.
Flora.
The natural vegetation appears in three separate sectors. Under 900m, in very clearly defined areas. Between 800/900m and 1600m is the domain of the black oak. From 1600m upwards, we find the juniper and the high pastures where the gentian, a plant in danger of extinction, can be found.
Human occupation.
The villages in the Serra da Estrela Natural Park area are mainly at the bottom of the mountains and date back to medieval times. However, before this other cultures left their mark on this area. One of the most notable examples of the Roman presence are the remains at "Famalicão" and "Folgosinho", of the road that connected Mérida to Braga. The route by which it crosses the mountain would certainly have caused difficulties in construction. The Arab influence is seen in the irrigation system and the fruit orchards while the Visigothic culture organized all rural space by applying the "Visigoth Code".
Economy.
Throughout the Natural Park, a traditional mountain economy is practised, centred on agriculture, shepherding of sheep and goats, particularly domestic sheep and the manufacture of Serra da Estrela cheese. The craftsmanship of the region is expressed in basket work using chestnut and wicker, weaving, embroidered cotton and smoked produce.

John Chalmers

John George Chalmers (August 17, 1874 – June 8, 1962) was an American football, basketball, and baseball coach. He served as the head football coach at Franklin & Marshall College (1902), the University of Iowa (1903–1905), Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, now known as Loras College, (1907–1914), and the University of Dubuque (1914–1924), compiling a career college football record of 100–47–8. Chalmers was also the head men's basketball coach at Iowa for one season (1904–1905), tallying a mark of 6–8, and the baseball coach at Iowa for two seasons (1904–1905) and at Columbia College from 1915 to 1921.
Background.
Born in New York, Chalmers was one of the most successful athletes in Lafayette College history. He graduated in 1902. In 1901, his coaching career began at Dubuque High School in Dubuque, Iowa. He led the D.H.S. football team to the state title in the championship game against West Des Monies High School; the final score read 12–0 in favor of D.H.S. Chalmers then served as athletic director at Franklin & Marshall College for a year before being hired to replace Alden Knipe as head football coach at the University of Iowa in 1903.
Coaching career.
Franklin & Marshall.
Chalmers was the head college football coach for the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He held that position for the 1902 season.His coaching record at Franklin & Marshall was 7 wins and 2 losses. As of the conclusion of the 2010 season, this ranks him #16 at Franklin & Marshall in total wins and #4 at the school in winning percentage (). He was hired from Lafayette College to replace John C. Hedges who had resigned the previous year.
Iowa.
Iowa had a 9–2 record in 1903 under Chalmers. Those nine wins were a school record that stood for 82 years. The record was tied in 1956 and 1983, but it was not until 1985 that an Iowa team surpassed Chalmers' nine wins in 1903.
The highlight of the 1903 season was a home victory over Illinois. The Hawkeyes had not yet won a home game against a Western Conference opponent, and Illinois had humiliated the Hawkeyes 80-0 in 1902. But the Hawkeyes pulled out a 12–0 victory in 1903, Iowa's first conference victory since 1900.
Iowa had a 7–4 record in 1904 and an 8–2 record in 1905. The 1905 team was led by captain Earle McGowan, one of the most prolific scorers in Hawkeye history. He scored 114 points in 1905, and the 1905 Hawkeyes shut out seven of their ten opponents. But losses to Minnesota and Chicago kept Iowa in the cellar in the Western Conference.
Chalmers served as Iowa's basketball coach during the 1904–1905 season, coaching the team to a 6–8 record. He also coached baseball at Iowa for two years in 1904 and 1905. Chalmers wanted to leave the university after the 1905 football season and begin his law practice in Dubuque. However, school officials convinced him to stay for one more year. Mark Catlin from the University of Chicago, the heir apparent to Chalmers as head coach, was hired that season to assist Chalmers. Although Catlin was actually an assistant coach, many Iowa records consider Catlin, not Chalmers, the official coach of the 1906 Hawkeyes.
TheWestern Conference meetings of 1905 led to two significant rule changes. Conference members were not allowed to play more than five games per season. Also, freshmen were now ineligible, and players were allowed a maximum of three years of eligibility. These rule changes were made in response to growing criticism over player injuries and deaths during games at that time.
These changes greatly hampered play in 1906. Conference players who were to be seniors were all ruled ineligible, because they had already played three years of competition. Players who were to be freshmen also sat out. Only players who were to be sophomores and juniors were allowed to play.
Iowa finished with a 2–3 record in 1906. Coaches Chalmers and Catlin worked well together but had contrasting coaching styles. Chalmers learned the eastern style of play at Lafayette, coaching players as individuals and devising conservative schemes to maximize their talents. Catlin learned the western style of play from Amos Alonzo Stagg at Chicago, coaching schemes rather than players and advocating an open, aggressive style.
Chalmers left Iowa with a record of 24–8 over three years. Official records indicate that he has the highest winning percentage of any Hawkeye coach that coached more than one year. However, Iowa won just one Western Conference game with Chalmers, the 1903 victory over Illinois.
Columbia and Dubuque.
Chalmers left Iowa for Dubuque in 1907. He set up his law practice, and he also became the first ever football coach at Columbia College. He coached Columbia from 1907 to 1914, compiling a 28–16–4 record. His 28 wins for official Columbia football squads has only been surpassed by current Loras coach Bob Bierie.
Chalmers, who considered coaching to be an enjoyable hobby, then became the first football coach in the history of the University of Dubuque. He coached football at that school from 1914–1924 and was also their first baseball coach from 1915–1921. The University of Dubuque has named their football field "Chalmers Field" in honor of him. In 1992, Chalmers was inducted into the University of Dubuque Athletic Hall of Fame.
Chalmers was a prominent lawyer and later a judge in Dubuque for 56 years.

William Townshend (colonial governor)

William Townshend (c. 1745 {some sources state 1762} - December 5, 1816) was a British politician and office holder, operating mainly in the colony of Prince Edward Island. One of his duties was Acting colonial Governor of Prince Edward Island between August 5, 1812 and July 24, 1813.
Early and Private Life.
Townshend's birthplace is unknown. His father was Richard Townshend of Wrexham (presumably Wrexham in Wales, though other evidence suggests a place in England, possibly Wexham, Buckinghamshire). 
He married Flora Stewart (b.1767 d.1843), the daughter of Chief Justice Peter Stewart, in c. 1790, and together they had eight children:
Threat of Government Scandal.
Much of William Townshend's early life is unclear, up until the point when he became collector of customs and naval officer for St. John's Island (today known as Prince Edward Island). Speculation states that Townshend may have obtained the appointment because of a family connection with George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, although others have said that Townshend had many connections with powerful officials in England.
Townshend arrived on the island in 1784 and was appointed to the Executive Council that December. Tension was soon built between Townshend and the island's colonial governor, Walter Patterson, who may have been angry that Townshend's appointment had come directly from the British Administration, Lord Sydney, the Home Secretary. 
Townshend had a secure place with the government of the colony, and was soon involved in Patterson's scheme to seize land from absentee landlords. Being a member of the council, he was present when legislation was passed on the land seizures, which had gone against the British government. A report was written and charges were brought to Townshend, as well as to many other officials. 
However, Townshend had still objected to the measures of the legislation, and had resigned. When the British Privy Council concluded its report in 1789, Townshend, who had resumed his seat in April 1787, was reported as being innocently drawn into the affair, and was permitted to keep his job, one of only a handful in the colony to do so. Governor Patterson, however, was removed from office in late 1789 and was replaced by Edmund Fanning. (Some sources show that Patterson was officially dismissed from office by Lord Sydney in the Spring of 1787.)
Collector of Customs.
As collector of customs, Townshend had his own bout of troubles in the colony. He crossed Governor Patterson in 1786 when he seized the property of merchants who had imported goods from the United States with Patterson's permission. Townshend was even accused of smuggling himself, by John Cambridge, a merchant, who had stated that Townshend had permitted smuggling from the Magdalen Islands. In 1788, an investigation by the commissioners of customs cleared Townshend of any wrongdoing. 
It is probable that the most important seizure ever conducted by Townshend was on Walter Patterson himself, in June 1788, when Patterson had already been ousted from office. Townshend arrived with soldiers on Patterson's farm, where the smuggling was taking place in the dead of night, making it illegal smuggling, but clashing broke out between the soldiers and about 25 of Patterson's men, mostly servants. However, the goods and the schooner used to transport them were eventually seized and sold off at the order of the Vice admiralty court. Townshend took part of several seizures over the following years, including property belonging to John Cambridge and other merchants. 
In 1791, Cambridge, other merchants and even some absentee landlords named Townshend as one of the men trying to form an illegal faction to rule the island. Townshend was also accused, among other allegations, of operating oppressive seizures. Townshend also accused the merchants of wrongdoing, and a stalemate was created between Townshend and the merchants. 
An investigation was later heard in London, where Townshend presented a detailed defense but it does not appear that he impressed the investigating committee. However, the following year, the charges against Townshend were dropped. The number of smuggling cases in Island courts considerably dropped over the following years.
When Fanning had first arrived on the island, in 1786, Townshend was found amongst those who wanted Patterson out of office. Fanning even praised Townshend to the British government, stating that Townshend was a very loyal servant to the measures of the government. This statement, together with Townshend's actions in exposing Patterson in 1788, may well be considered part of William Pitt's campaign to stiffen up Customs regulations and to clear up smuggling that had become rampant under Lord North's ministry. However, with the multitude of accusations brought against Townshend, it is clear that his actions were not well-received locally.
"Temporary Commander in Chief".
Later in life, Townshend wished to seek a more high-profile position within the government, but his attempts failed, and so did his health. However, in spite of illness, Townshend was named "Temporary Commander in Chief" (Acting Governor) of Prince Edward Island in 1812 following the removal of Governor Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres. Townshend was chosen for the job over senior councilor Thomas DesBrisay. William Townshend was so ill by the time he became Acting Governor, that he had to gather the strength to raise himself out of bed to sign in his new position. 
Townshend's short time in office, lasting less than a year, was very uneventful, for he mainly followed the instructions of the Colonial Office. By the time he was replaced by Charles Douglass Smith as Governor on July 24, 1813, Townshend was quite satisfied with what he had accomplished on Prince Edward Island. 
Illness overwhelming him, William Townshend died in 1816 on a visit to Plymouth, England.

Community of St. Francis

The Community of St. Francis (CSF) is a Franciscan Anglican religious order of sisters founded in 1905, and is the oldest surviving Anglican Franciscan religious community. As First Order sisters, the CSF is an autonomous part of the Society of St. Francis (First Order brothers), which also includes the Order of St. Clare (Second Order sisters), and a Third Order of secular members living as a dispersed community. Living under a Franciscan Rule, the sisters' primary vocation is prayer, study, and work in the context of community life. Some sisters serve as priests, and others live a solitary life.
History.
The community was begun in 1905 by Sr Rosina Eleanor Rice, who left another Anglican religious order, the Sisters of Bethany, to found CSF. After a short period in Hull, the sisters moved to Dalston in East London in 1908, where they supported themselves by working in the parish, caring for the sick and dying, and running a laundry. In the late 1950s their house came under a compulsory purchase order, and in 1962 CSF moved to a house in the hamlet of Compton Durville, near Yeovil in Somerset. There they ran a nursing home for elderly women for some years, before changing their ministry to one of hospitality. CSF grew considerably, and new houses were founded in other parts of the country. In 2010 the sisters closed their house at Compton Durville.
Structure.
The order is under the leadership of a Minister General, currently Sr Joyce CSF, who was elected in 2002. Under the Minister General the Order is divided into provinces, each governed by a Minister Provincial.
CSF European Province.
The European Province currently has the following houses of the Order:
CSF American Province.
The American Province, established in 1974, is currently located in a single house:
CSF Korea.
The semi-autonomous mission in Korea is not yet large enough to achieve provincial status, and the single convent at Gumi is part of the European Province, and under the authority of the European Minister Provincial.

Polyphosphazene

Polyphosphazenes include a wide range of hybrid inorganic-organic polymers with a number of different skeletal architectures that contain alternating phosphorus and nitrogen atoms. Nearly all of these molecules contain two organic or organometallic side groups attached to each phosphorus atom. These include linear polymers with the formula (N=PR1R2)n, where R1 and R2 are organic or organometallic side groups. The linear polymers are the largest group, with the general structure shown schematically in the picture. Other known architectures are cyclolinear and cyclomatrix polymers in which small phosphazene rings are connected together by organic chain units. Other architectures are available, such as block copolymer, star, dendritic, or comb-type structures. More than 700 different polyphosphazenes are known, with different side groups (R) and different molecular architectures. Many of these polymers were first synthesized and studied in the research group of Harry R. Allcock at The Pennsylvania State University.
__TOC__
Synthesis.
The method of synthesis depends on the type of polyphosphazene. The most widely used method for linear polymers is based on a two-step process. In the first step a cyclic small molecule phosphazene, known as hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, with the formula (NPCl2)3, is heated in a sealed system at 250 °C to convert it to a long chain linear polymer with typically 15,000 or more repeating units. In the second step the chlorine atoms linked to phosphorus in the polymer are replaced by organic groups through reactions with alkoxides, aryloxides, amines or organometallic reagents. Because many different reagents can participate in this macromolecular substitution reaction, and because two or more different reagents may be used, a large number of different polymers can be produced, each with a different combination of properties. Variations to this process are possible using poly(dichlorophosphazene) made by condensation reactions.
Another synthetic process uses a living cationic polymerization that allows the formation of block copolymers or comb, star, or dendritic architectures. Other synthetic methods include the condensation reactions of organic-substituted phosphoranimines.
Cyclomatrix type polymers made by linking small molecule phosphazene rings together employ difunctional organic reagents to replace the chlorine atoms in (NPCl2)3, or the introduction of allyl or vinyl substituents, which are then polymerized by free-radical methods. Such polymers may be useful as coatings or thermosetting resins, often prized for their thermal stability.
Properties and uses.
The linear high polymers have the geometry shown in the picture. More than 700 different macromolecules that correspond to this structure are known with different side groups or combinations of different side groups. In these polymers the properties are controlled partly by the high flexibility of the backbone, its radiation resistance, high refractive index, ultraviolet and visible transparency, and its fire resistance. However, the side groups exert an equal or even greater influence on the properties since they impart properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, color, useful biological properties such as bioerodibility, or ion transport properties to the polymers. Representative examples of these polymers are shown below.
Thermoplastics.
The first stable thermoplastic poly(organophosphazenes), isolated in the mid 1960’s by Allcock, Kugel, and Valan, were macromolecules with trifluoroethoxy, phenoxy, methoxy, ethoxy, or various amino side groups. Of these early species, poly[NP(OCH2CF3)2n, has proved to be the subject of intense research due to its crystallinity, high hydrophobicity, biological compatibility, fire resistance, general radiation stability, and ease of fabrication into films, microfibers and nanofibers. It has also been a substrate for various surface reactions to immobilize biological agents. The polymers with phenoxy or amino side groups have also been studied in detail.
Phosphazene elastomers.
The first large-scale commercial uses for linear polyphosphazenes were in the field of high technology elastomers, with a typical example containing a combination of trifluoroethoxy and longer chain fluoroalkoxy groups. The mixture of two different side groups eliminates the crystallinity found in single-substituent polymers and allows the inherent flexibility and elasticity to become manifest. Glass transition temperatures as low as -60 °C are attainable, and properties such as oil-resistance and hydrophobicity are responsible for their utility in land vehicles and aerospace components. They have also been used in biostable biomedical devices.
Other side groups, such as non-fluorinated alkoxy or oligo-alkyl ether units, yield hydrophilic or hydrophobic elastomers with glass transitions over a broad range from -100 °C to + 100 °C. Polymers with two different aryloxy side groups have also been developed as elastomers for fire-resistance as well as thermal and sound insulation applications.
Polymer electrolytes.
Linear polyphosphazenes with oligo-ethyleneoxy side chains are gums that are good solvents for salts such as lithium triflate. These solutions function as electrolytes for lithium ion transport, and they have been the focus of much research designed to incorporate them into fire-resistant rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery. The same polymers are also of interest as the electrolyte in experimental dye-sensitized solar cells. Other polyphosphazenes with sulfonated aryloxy side groups are proton conductors of interest for use in the membranes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
Hydrogels.
Water-soluble poly(organophosphazenes) with oligo-ethyleneoxy side chains can be cross-linked by gamma-radiation techniques. The cross-linked polymers absorb water to form hydrogels which are responsive to temperature changes, expanding to a limit defined by the cross-link density below a critical solution temperature, but contracting above that temperature. This is the basis of controlled permeability membranes. Other polymers with both oligo-ethyleneoxy and carboxyphenoxy side groups expand in the presence of monovalent cations but contract in the presence of di- or tri-valent cations, which form ionic cross-links. Phosphazene hydrogels have been utilized for controlled drug release and other medical applications.
Bioerodible polyphosphazenes.
The ease with which properties can be controlled and fine-tuned by the linkage of different side groups to polyphosphazene chains has prompted major efforts to address biomedical materials challenges using these polymers. Different polymers have been studied as macromolecular drug carriers, as membranes for the controlled delivery of drugs, as biostable elastomers, and especially as tailored bioerodible materials for the regeneration of living bone. An advantage for this last application is that poly(dichlorophosphazene) reacts with amino acid ethyl esters (such as ethyl glycinate or the corresponding ethyl esters of numerous other amino acids) through the amino terminus to form polyphosphazenes with amino acid ester side groups. These polymers hydrolyze slowly to a near-neutral, pH-buffered solution of the amino acid, ethanol, phosphate, and ammonium ion. The speed of hydrolysis depends on the amino acid ester, with half-lives that vary from weeks to months depending on the structure of the amino acid ester. Nanofibers and porous constructs of these polymers assist osteoblast replication and accelerate the repair of bone in animal model studies.
Commercial aspects.
The cyclic trimer, (NPCl2)3, is commercially available and has formed the starting point for most commercial developments. Prominent among these developments has been the high performance elastomers known as PN-F or Eypel-F, which have been manufactured for seals, O-rings, and dental devices. An aryloxy-substituted polymer has also been developed as a fire resistant expanded foam for thermal and sound insulation. The patent literature contains many references to cyclomatrix polymers derived from cyclic trimeric phosphazenes incorporated into cross-linked resins for fire resistant circuit boards and related applications.

Calendars in the Forgotten Realms

In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, years (usually described as the passing of winters or summers) are referred to by names, each name is not consistent across the Realms. This helps alleviate any confusion from multiple writers using different names for the same year. Each kingdom or city-state numbers years differently, usually to measure the reign of a dynasty or the current monarch, or since the founding of the country. The result is a hodgepodge of overlapping numbers that serve to confuse the ordinary person and frustrate the sage. The widespread differing year dates include the following:
Dalereckoning (DR): Dalereckoning is taken from the Year of Sunrise, when the Standing Stone was raised by the elves of Cormanthor and the human Dalesfolk. Since this time, humans were permitted by the Elven Court to settle in the more open regions of the forests. In some texts, primarily those which do not have direct ties to Dales history, Dalereckoning is called Freeman's Reckoning (FR). The calendar is widely used in Faerûn but has not spread beyond its shores. Dalereckoning is the most common year measurement and is used in all of the "Forgotten Realms" sourcebooks.
The current campaign date of the "Forgotten Realms" (4ed) is 1479 DR—as of the real-world year of 2009.
Cormyr Reckoning (CR): Cormyr Reckoning begins at the foundation of House Obarskyr, the dynasty that still rules that land. The 25-year gap between Cormyr Reckoning and Dalereckoning has caused much of the confusion regarding elder days. Timelines and calendars of the period often use DR designators, but place the founding of Cormyr at 1 DR instead of 26 DR. This is understandable, given that the two reckonings are from two nearby parties and spread by a third (the merchants of Sembia), but it causes learned sages to slam their heads violently against their desks trying to figure things out.
Northreckoning (NR): Used in the City of Waterdeep, Northreckoning dates from the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep. A more archaic system called Waterdeep Years (WY) dates from the supposed first use of Waterdeep as a trading post. This reckoning is now largely abandoned except in ancient texts.
Mulhorand Calendar (MC): One of the oldest calendars in use in the Realms, this ancient scheme of record-keeping dates from the founding of Skuld, the City of Shadows, reputedly by a Mulhorandi god.
Present Reckoning (PR): In an attempt to get a handle on the various number systems in use, a new type of reckoning has been implemented with the approval of such worthies as Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun of Waterdeep and Vangerdahast of Cormyr and carried abroad by the Harpers. All year-dates trace back to the Time of Troubles as Year 0.
The Names of years.
Every year has its own name in Dalereckoning. Year names are listed in Year Names in Dalereckoning.
Calendar of Harptos.
There are 365 days in the year, split up into twelve months of thirty days each with five holidays that fall between some months. The names of the months are given in both the formal names and the common ones. The seasons run like they do for the northern hemisphere; Hammer is like January and Flamerule is like July. Each week consists of ten days, called a tenday.
The holidays are Midwinter, Greengrass, Midsummer, Highharvestide and The Feast of the Moon. Midwinter falls between Hammer and Alturiak, Greengrass between Tarsakh and Mirtul, Midsummer is between Flamerule and Eleasis, Highharvestide is between Elient and Marpenoth, and The Feast of the Moon is between Uktar and Nightal.
Note: The holidays do not fall on the actual day the season changes. The 19th of Ches is the Spring Equinox, the 20th of Kythorn is the Summer Solstice, the 21st of Elient is the Autumn Equinox and the 20th of Nightal is the Winter Solstice.
Every four years, another holiday called Shieldmeet is added as a leap day immediately following the Midsummer holiday.

<doc id="5967955" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967955" title="Au Revoir Simone">
Au Revoir Simone

Au Revoir Simone is an electronic dream pop band from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, formed in late 2003. The group is composed of Erika Forster (vocals/keyboard), Annie Hart (vocals/keyboard), and Heather D'Angelo (vocals/drum machine/keyboard). The band's name comes from a line Pee-wee Herman says to a minor character (named Simone) in Tim Burton's 1985 film, "Pee-wee's Big Adventure".
History.
Au Revoir Simone began in the autumn of 2003 when Erika Forster and Annie Hart first became acquainted on a long train ride home to NYC from a weekend getaway with friends. Along the way they exchanged stories and ambitions, and discovered that they shared a common desire to form an all-keyboard band. When they returned to New York City, they began meeting regularly to play music. Heather D'Angelo started joining in at these informal bedroom band practices, which also included former member Sung Bin Park (keyboard/vocals). Soon after, they started playing shows around Manhattan and Brooklyn. In January 2005, Park left the band and the girls started anew as a trio. 
In 2006 they did a Take-Away Show video session shot by Vincent Moon, and toured the US, Canada and Europe with We Are Scientists. The following year, they went on a US tour with Peter, Bjorn and John. In 2007 they played a concert at Fondation Cartier in Paris for David Lynch's retrospective exhibition. The stage they performed on was a recreation of the set from his film "Eraserhead". 
Au Revoir Simone played at both the Treasure Island Music Festival and Monolith Festival in September 2007, as well as the Lovebox festival in London in 2009. At the end of 2009 the group embarked on their own headlining tour of Japan. In 2007, the band contributed a t-shirt design to raise money for Transportation Alternatives. In 2010, they created one of the first interactive music videos for their song "Knight of Wands." In true coloring book style, the video allows viewers to become a part of the creative process. 
The band's debut album was named after a tiny book that Hart received, titled "Verses of Comfort, Assurance and Salvation". The group felt that the name completely fit their music and the way it made them feel, so they chose it for the album title.
Musical style.
Au Revoir Simone's music has been described by London's "The Times" as "a collision between the Waitresses, Stereolab and Kings of Convenience, their music has power from what it holds back rather than spells out, and is just waiting to be fallen in love with (or to)." British "Vogue" has said, “Eschewing the typical guitar-heavy band set-up for old-school synthesizers and vintage drum machines, Revoir Simone create dreamy synth-pop. Their soft ethereal vocals laid over spare homemade drumbeats are reminiscent of Air and Stereolab." Pitchforkmedia.com has said their music is "feather-light electro-pop that's not to be taken lightly." 
David Lynch called the group's music "innocent, hip and new." "Spin" also reviewed the group: "Powered by vintage keyboards, a lockstep beat-box, and gorgeous, wide-eyed warbling, the Simones create make-out music for your inner android." "NME" said: "Au Revoir Simone onstage like the sisters from "The Virgin Suicides"—[its looks ranging from prim librarian, to hippy housewife to raven-haired art student. group excavates the lost corner, joining Ladytron and Camera Obscura: lush electronic hypno-folk that breezes from the speakers like chocolate melting over one of Latitude's many £5-a-crepe food stalls". In another "NME" article, the magazine noted, "Au Revoir Simone must have beamed in from a land where lace clouds breeze over crystal lakes and icicles grow from the warm earth. This New York three-piece's glorious synth-lead alt-folk will leave you crying on the stairs in the middle of the night." The group defined itself as playing "warm and electronic music with forthright female vocalists."
Musical influences.
According to the website of the band's European label, the group's musical influences could be "likened to a dutifully mined musical thrift store"; these diverse influences include Modest Mouse, Stereolab, The Mountain Goats, Louis Prima, Pavement, The Beach Boys, Björk, Broadcast, Belle & Sebastian, David Bowie, Bee Gees, and Billie Holiday. Forster harbors a love of German label Morr Music, specifically artists such as Guther, Lali Puna, and Ms. John Soda.
In popular culture.
The group performed "Stay Golden," "Sad Song," and "Dark Halls" live at a 2007 Robert Normand fashion show in Paris. "Sad Song" was featured in the 2007 German blockbuster movie "Keinohrhasen" (English: "Rabbits Without Ears") and later on the soundtrack of the 2011 movie "From Prada to Nada". Also in 2007, their song "Stay Golden" appeared in the French film "Anna M.". "The Lucky One" and "Don't See the Sorrow" were heard in the 2008 Japanese film "Kimi no Tomodachi" (English: "Your Friends"). In November 2008, Au Revoir Simone were featured in both the original and the Aeroplane remix of Friendly Fires track "Paris". In 2009, Au Revoir Simone's song "Another Likely Story" was featured on the 100th episode ("What a Difference a Day Makes") of "Grey's Anatomy". That same year, "The Lucky One" was the closing song in episode 12 of the third season of "Ugly Betty", was featured in the "Loyal and True" episode of series "The L Word", and served as the background music for a Cheerios cereal television commercial. In 2010, "Another Likely Story" was the closing song in the 10th episode ("I Can't Quit You Baby") of the first season of "Covert Affairs". The band's song "Crazy" was featured in the 2014 film "Vampire Academy" and its soundtrack. "Tell Me" was used in Nokia Lumia 620's commercial, "90210", "Teen Wolf" and "Ringer".

<doc id="5967961" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967961" title="Misclassification of employees as independent contractors">
Misclassification of employees as independent contractors

IRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) independent contractors are recategorized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as W-2 employees. The reclassification can result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and "back-taxes" for which the employer is generally liable. These amounts could cost a business large sums of money. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (formerly known as the General Accounting Office) reports that the IRS claims to lose millions of dollars in uncollected payroll, social security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance taxes because of misclassification of independent contractors by taxpayers.According to IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson in a statement made November 3, 2005, IRS audits of small businesses organized as corporations increased from 7,294 in 2004 to 17,867 in 2005. [http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,id=150358,00.html
Who is being classified?
Employers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS form W-2 and 1099, respectively. Employers pay different taxes (i.e. Social Security and Medicare taxes, unemployment taxes, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. However, these same taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. If an employer intentionally or mistakenly classifies an employee as an independent contractor, the employer is then at risk for being heavily fined and paying "back-taxes".
Being classified as an independent contractor also affects whether an employee can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no W-2 employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund, and since no one can file a claim for benefits, they don't have to worry about their accounts being charged any extra. So should a misclassified employee lose his job through no fault of his own, that employee has no recourse with the Department of Labor and no unemployment benefits upon which to fall back.
Employee vs. independent contractor.
According to the IRS, an employee is anyone who performs services for an employer if the employer can control what will be done and how it will be done. This was codified in revenue ruling 87-41, and is generally called "the twenty factor test". Independent contractors are defined so if the payer or employer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work done, and not the means and methods of accomplishing the result. There are also other categories such as non-employees, which include direct sellers.[http://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,id=128602,00.html
IRS Documents: Form SS-8, Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding.
If it is still unclear whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor the IRS Form SS-8 can be filed with the IRS.
Mitigating IRS reclassification risk.
One must determine if an evaluation of a worker’s classification is necessary. Independent contractors on an approved vendor list, or whose services are on an exempt services list, may not require an evaluation. Also, independent contractors immediately willing to become W-2 employees through a Portable Employer of Record will not require an evaluation. 
If the analysis is necessary, a qualified "Compliance Officer" attempts to produce an accurate judgment of the workers classification, and delivers his or her written recommendation to the employer.
A "Compliance File", including all necessary supporting documentation for the compliant independent contractor, is kept on file in the event of an audit.

Legio Maria

http://lejionmaria.blogspot.com/
Legio Maria (Latin, “Legion of Mary”) — also known as Legio Maria of African Church Mission, and Maria Legio — is a Spirit Initiated Church (SIC) or new religious movement initially among the Luo people of western Kenya, which is an extension of interpreted Third Secret of Fatima to a new, albeit African, context.The religious movement was initiated by repeated appearances of a mystic woman to several Roman Catholic members delivering messages about the incarnation of the son of God as a black man. These appearances are said to have begun around 1938, almost simultaneous with the beginning of Edel Quinne's lay catholic mission to Africa. By the early 1960s the movement had assembled a good number of catechists, acolytes, and believers in a spiritual return of Jesus Christ. The continuous expansion of this movement coupled with its belief in Simeo Ondetto as the returned Son of God led to theological tension, and eventual break with lay catholic movement, Legion of Mary. Legio Maria was legally registered in Kenya in 1966 as a church, expanded massively in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and eventually spread to many countries in Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Zaire, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria. In 1966, one of its founders, Mama Maria, died and was buried at Efeso Church, in Nzoia, Siaya County, while the principal founder, Simeo Ondetto died in 1991 and was buried in Got Calvary, in Migori County.
History.
Formation.
Legio Maria developed gradually and eventually separated from mainstream Roman Catholic in 1963. What is now legio Maria started from the catholic lay movement as far back as 1938-1940. Central to its formation are the local Luo myths about a mystery woman, min Omolo Ka-Nyunja, who walked Luo land during these years. A number of Legio Maria faithfuls believe that this woman was responsible for the mythical stories such as Nyamgondho Kombare in Gwassi, Homa Bay County,and Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay County. According to Tobias Oloo, a Legio Maria Deacon and researcher,"every religion has mythical elements and the Legio Maria movement's development relied massively on the crystallization of local myths with their beliefs". Apart from the myths that probably preceded legio maria, Deacon Oloo affirms that the Fatima Visitation of Virgin Mary was a key ingredient to the formation of Legio Maria. "As legios, we recognize the three Fatima mysteries. However, the most important for us is the third mystery which predicted the appearance of Our Lord in the 1960s. Though this mystery is controversial because the Roman Catholic did not reveal it for generations and what they eventually revealed is still contested by many Christians, we have faith that through the third mystery Mary promised the coming of Simeo Ondetto".
Demographics.
In 1963 a movement of dissatisfied Roman Catholics in South Nyanza Province left the Diocese of Kisii and formed the Legio Maria Church, or Legion of Mary Church, under the leadership of the Lodvikus-son of God Simeo Melkio Ondetto and an old mystic woman named Mama Maria. This mystic woman is the one Legio Maria adherents relate with the Fatima Secrets. She is believed to have called a number of Catholics to the new movement by visionary appearances, telling them to look forward to her son who had come to Africa. Her spiritual son, Simeo Ondetto, was then a catechist in Roman Catholic Church. Ondetto was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960s. By 1980 the church numbered 248,000 adherents. Government estimates at the time of the split from the Catholic Church stated that there were nearly 90,000 followers of Legio Maria. By 1968, it had become a member of the East African United Churches.
The Legio Maria Church was not the only church schism among the Luo people in the early years of Kenyan independence. Catholic missionaries had been working among the Luo for 61 years before the 1963 split. By 1966 there were 31 “distinct Luo separatist churches registered with the Kenyan Government.” Across Kenya, “by 1966 there were 160 distinct bodies with a total of 600,000 adherents, most of whom were formerly members of the Protestant or Catholic Churches,” with the Legion of Mary Church being the largest of the schisms from the Catholic Church. Today, estimates of the number of Legio Maria adherents range from 3.5 to 4 million or down to just over three million. In this regard, the Legio Maria Church is one of the most resilient and successful of the African Initiated Churches. While the Legio Maria Church began exclusively as a movement among the Luo people, it is now found all over Kenya and even has significant numbers of communities among the Turkana,Kalenjin, Kamba, Luhya of Kenya,and in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DRC, and Ethiopia. In 1979, the word "mission" was added to the church's official name, becoming the “Legio Maria of African Church Mission.”
Origins of the Movement.
According to Legio Maria leaders and researchers, the origins of the movement can be traced to the convergence of at least four separate events: the concealment by the Roman Catholic Church of ‘the third secret of Fatima;’ the visions of Mary to several people informing them of the coming of her son; Simeo Ondetto’s supernatural attributes that established him as a spiritual leader; the coming of the Holy Spirit at the home of John Baru in Suna Migori and the Spirit's declaration that Simeo Ondetto is an ' incarnated son of God'; and several miracles and wonders that accompanied the mission of Ondetto, Mary, and numberless Legio Prophets.
Reliance on Prophets.
Legio Maria had many notable prophets at its founding. According to Tobias Oloo,it is the massive number of prophets and prophetesses in Legio Maria that made it break into a formidable religious organization. Among the prophets that Oloo attributes the success of a young legio movement to are Tobias Oongo, Silvester Okweto, Sila of Yimbo, Siprianus Ochien'g, and Gaudencia Aoko. The name of Gaudencia Aoko has featured prominently as a founder and even a co-equal with Simeo Ondetto, but according to Tobias Oloo, this is a confusion. Oloo affirmed that Gaudencia Aoko achieved great feats for Legio Maria, but was in no way comparable to Simeo Ondetto. Born among the Luo of western Kenya, Aoko was only 20 when she joined Legio Maria. The death of her two children, apparently thought to be due to witchcraft pushed her to seek divine intervention from the 'budding prophet Simeo Ondetto' leading to her eventual conversion. Aoko was referred to Ondetto by her brother-in-law, Johanes Muga, and went to Ondetto to seek help. She was commissioned to pray for the sick with Rosary and to battle witchcraft by Simeo Ondetto and the old woman, Mama Maria. Going back to her homeland in Kano and stretching to Alego, Siaya, of Western Kenya, Aoko exorcised evil spirits, burnt amulets, and converted many people to the Legio movement. Tobias Oloo insists that it is the agility of the young Aoko that led to her being confused with the 90 year old legio maria founder, Mama Maria." Migori
The Third Secret of Fátima.
The Three Secrets of Fátima are related to a number of appearances of Mary to three shepherd children in 1917 at Fatima, Portugal. It was there that Mary revealed three secrets to the shepherds. The Catholic Church released the first two secrets in the 1940s but the surviving shepherd did not write down the third secret until 1944. She sealed the envelope and instructed the church to not open the secret until 1960. Yet, to the consternation of many, the church did not reveal the secret in 1960, leading to countless rumours and theories as to why the church would not want to reveal a statement or prophecy officially attributed to the Virgin Mary. The Legio Maria Church believes that Church officials in Rome refused to release the true secret because it revealed Mary's prophecy of a Black Christ for Africa. Schwartz recounts the theory:
Angry at Rome, Mary decided to ‘walk away from those people’. She determined apparitions no longer sufficed. She would tread on African soil as a person with her Son. Colorless in Heaven, both would become black Africans and bring her message directly to a more receptive audience. Legios declared ‘The Third Secret of Fatima’ was about the mission of the son of God in Africa,the coming of Legio, and the beginning of a new religious age.
In 2000, the Catholic Church released the official third secret of Fatima alongside a commentary on the meaning of the secret written by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Many groups, including the Legio Maria Church believe the church is continuing to cover-up the true secret revealed by Mary at Fatima.
Dead and Risen.
While at Sagegi in 1958, serving as a Catholic catechist, and living in the home of another catechist known as Petrus Pitalis Ogeka, Simeo Ondeto is said to have died for 3 days and came back to life with a mission-focused approach. After rising from death, Ondetto began to call himself the son of God. He was now preaching that he had gone to confer with God the Father about his mission and was freed to begin his mission. He describes a visit to heaven, chats with saints, angels, and God. Simeo Ondetto permitted the baptism of polygamists and the baptism of old Catholic converts without going through catechism training. He also said that he was sent to start a church called Legio Maria.
Appearances of the Virgin Mary.
According to early adherents of Legio Maria, the Virgin Mary began appearing among the Luo people in the late 1920s. In their accounts, they say that she first appeared as an extraordinary itinerary woman. At a time estimated to be around 1935, this woman was walking at Awendo market in South Nyanza, when an empathizing tailor known as Omollo who was the son of Nyunja of Alego, Udida, gave her a dress gift. This woman is said to have promised Omollo an eternal name among the Luos. From that day on she began calling herself the mother of Omollo. By the 1940s, this woman is claimed to have visited the Catholic parish of Nyandago and conversed with over five members of its clergy about the mission of Ondetto. However, priests at Nyandago mission discounted the supposed apparitions, stating that Mary could not appear as a Black African. Legio tradition tells of Mary and her son being incarnated as Luo in the beginning of the 1900s, with Mary entering into an earlier time period than Jesus. Mary wandered throughout Luo land during this time, performing healings and other miracles; the church was officially organised “when the 90-year-old Mary and her adult spiritual Son, Simeo Ondeto, were reunited in Suna, South Nyanza followed by the coming of the Holy Spirit(Mount the World Has Opened to the Light).” Schwartz recounts that the “Black Mary ‘returned to Heaven’ on 23 December 1966, and that those who met her claimed “direct personal experience of Mary’s disclosure of the meanings of the ‘Third Secret of Fatima,’” in which it was revealed that “the Virgin Mary brought a new liberating religion for the world through an African Mission!” At nearly 90 years of age, from 1963 to 1966, the mystical Mary could not reach many places. This resulted in the confusion of Gaudencia Aoko, a prophet, with Mama Maria, the harbinger who prepared the world for the coming of her son.
Birth and Early Life of Simeo Ondetto.
Born in around 1926 to Luo parents, Margaret Aduwo and Obimbo Misumba, the Black Son of God (Simeo Ondeto) grew up in Angoro village, Kano location, near the Nyanza-Rift Valley border. He was named Ondetto by his parents and later got baptised as Simeo after years of studying catechism. According to his brother, Nelson Owino Obimbo, a Legio Maria Cardinal Dean(2011), Simeo was an extraordinary child. Owino who is older than Ondetto lists around six childhood miracles performed by Ondetto while young. Ondetto left their home in Awasi as a young man, worked at Miwani Sugar Company in Western Kenya for a short duration before moving to Tanzania Mara to stay with his relatives there. Around 1955,Ondetto returned home in Awasi, only focused on a missionary life. To find a way of keeping him home, his parents called a meeting that resolved that the only way to keep him home was to have him get married. Ondetto declined the offer of a wife and instead kept a life of solitude and meditation. He moved to Sagegi to live with a catholic catechist before starting the Legio movement.
Gaudencia Aoko Fetters.
After joining the Legio movement, Gaudencia Aoko converted so many people. In Luo central Nyanza, she was the most visible figure of Legio Maria during its founding years. That she was the founder of Legio is often a confusion with Mama Maria, a 90-year old mystic woman who revealed visions to many Legions. When official church doctrine restricted Aoko's role to only a prophet and legio nun, without giving her the priestly position that she had occupied in the lives of the many people she converted, conflict set in. Aoko, felt females were not being given enough room. According to Deacon Tobias Oloo, Aoko's departure from Legio Maria was not a statement that she did not believe in Ondetto as God. In fact, Oloo affirms that Aoko continued to revere Ondetto even after her departure, using the images of Ondetto and Mama Maria on her worship altars and advising her followers to do so. Nonetheless, during her tense battles to retain her high position in Legio Maria,in 1968, Aoko went to a press conference and announced that she was the official founder of Legio, and expelled Simeo Ondetto and two other leaders of the church for giving themselves the titles of “God,” “Pope,” and “Cardinal.” This moment of decision is recognized as Aoko's spiritual downfall. She lost her charisma; went for a second baptism in Tanzania Mara by Mercellianus Orongo, another Legion who left the movement because of Ondetto's claims to be the son of God; and by 1971, Aoko was negotiating a return to Legio Maria as an ordinary worshiper.
Official Hierarchy.
The full official title for Simeo Ondeto became Baba Simeo Lodvikus Melkio, the eternal spiritual leader and mediator of Legio Maria.
The administrative duties of the church were put under a Pope. So far, there have been three such popes:
By 2010, there were differences in Legio Maria that led to the coronation of a cardinal, Romanus On'gombe, as a pope while Rafael Adika still claimed the position. The wage between the two leaders has taken legio Maria to the courts more than three times, and the differences still persist. According to Deacon Tobias Oloo, the differences will end soon. "Simeo Ondetto has foretold those differences and said that legio Marias unity will return under the fourth pope."
Under the popes are over 500 deacons, 350 priests, 60 bishops,21 arch-bishops, 17 cardinals. Currently, all these lower hierarchies swear allegiance to the different sides led by Adika and On'gombe. Some notable people on the On'gombe side are On'gawo Aloo (Cardinal Admin), Owino Obimbo (cardinal Dean), Romanus Odongo (Arch-bishop-Rongo), the late Susana nyar Ouma (Ondetto's cook), and Bishop Melkio. Notable people on Adika's side are Cardinal Atieno (cardinal admin), Maurice Akello (chief-Deacon), Elias Komenya, Mother Dorina (Ka-Baru, and Hellena nyar Rosari.
A parallel hierarchy to the male priesthood is the Legio Maria women priesthood that is led by Nuns (Mothers). Legio nuns are married women who are ordained. The lowest female rank in Legio Maria church is sisterhood, then mother (heads a mission), superior mother (heads a diocese), arch mother (heads an arch diocese), and Dean mother (head of legio mothers).
Below the clergy are church teachers and church administrators who are elected by the faithfuls. Prophets are also core to the Legio Maria mission because the church is Spirit Initiated.
Messianic Theology.
According to Legio Maria teaching Simeo Ondetto is the son of God sent to establish God the Father's dispensation. Legio Maria believes in dispensations or times when God has stepped into human history after the fall of man. The first is found in the Old Testament “when the High Priest Melchizedek appeared to Abraham. Melchizedek established a reign of a monotheistic awareness which ended with the arrival of Jesus. The dispensation established by Jesus was one of recognising the trinity, of individual salvation, and established universal barometer of religion which is love. Instead of the law, the second dispensation is characterised by love. The third dispensation is the reign of God established by Simeo Ondetto as Lodvikus, that is the son of God sent to show the glory of God to the World. In Legio Maria theology, the second person of the trinity has appeared in history three times: as Melchizedek Son of God to define the history of the human redemption by blessing God's chosen race through Abraham; as Jesus to conclude the mission of redemption, opening it and teaching the core element which is love; and as Simeo Lodvikus, to reveal the glory of life after death and the nature of God. To Legio Maria faithfuls, Simeo Ondetto, Jesus of Nazareth and Melchizedek are one and the same person incarnated during different dispensations of human history. 
Simeo Ondeto is known as the Lodvikus or The Glory of God, whose role is to bring the world to understand the hidden treasures of life after death and dramatise the reality of eternal life. According to Legio Maria the promise by Jesus to return has been fulfilled by the coming of Simeo. Legio Maria also seems not to believe in a final judgement of the whole world. They believe in immediate judgement of individuals immediately after death. This is supported by the long list of adored Legio saints. Some of the official Legio Maria saints include Timotheo Atila, Maria Ombwayo, Tobias Oongo, Petro Otieno, Mumbo Carilus and Angi Clement. Church leaders distinguish Messias Simeo Ondeto's mission as separate from that of Jesus. He was not sent to replace Jesus, for Jesus was a name given to the son of God when he accomplished a second dispensational mission. Instead, Messias Simeo Ondeto is God incarnated in another context, specifically for the third dispensation of the glory of God. Often, 1 John 4:1 is used as biblical support for the confession that God has again come into the flesh through Messias Simeo Ondeto, for “every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God…Therefore we say that Jesus has come in the flesh.
Finding Africa in the yoke of colonialism, Simeo is also talked of as a saviour from the oppression of colonialism and “healer and protector from the evils of witchcraft.” Simeo Ondeto is not seen merely God’s messenger, but as “the actual embodiment of God in history.”
In their affirmation that Messias Simeo Ondeto is the Black Messiah, the Legio Maria do not exclude the possibility and reality that the Messiah has been incarnated in multiple times and contexts. In interviews during her three years researching the Legio Maria Church, Nancy Schwartz relates,
most Legios insisted to me that theirs was not the only way to choose light and Heaven. The Baba Messias Ondeto had preached that ‘God is a polygynist’ who loves ‘all the houses in his home’. All religions, he had said, are akin to ‘branches of a tree that bears fruit’. Legios reiterated that black and white people could both get to Heaven, if they followed their faiths.
Thus, salvation is available through other religions and revelations of God. While the Legio are clear that God has provided specific revelations and even incarnations for different peoples of the world, this does not translate into an exclusivist position in which only adherents of Legio Maria will be with God in heaven. According to Schwartz, “most Legios affirmed that Heaven was a place where the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Mary, saints, angels and Old Testament prophets and patriarchs are without color, a place where there is nothing like Mzungu (European/white person) and African.” She concludes that the Legio Maria Church has “formulat their own version of an anti-racist black liberation theology,” which is very unique.
Practices.
Prayers and Worship.
The Legio Maria Church meets as individual congregations for regular prayer and worship. Often the congregations live together in community homes. The Church uses many Roman Catholic hymns in worship services, and employs both original Legio Maria songs and Catholic hymns in informal services, often accompanied with singing, teaching and prayers. Crosses, swords and other symbols are often carried by male adherents or worn around their necks. During worship, both men and women wear robes and women additionally wear head coverings. The robes and head coverings can be any number of colours, and some communities wear their robes at all times as a distinguishing mark of Legio identity. Candles are normally present in worship as representations of spiritual presence. The Legio, in addition to Legio-specific African saints, recognise most Roman Catholic saints.
Strict Holiness.
As an AIC, some aspects of African traditional religion and beliefs are incorporated into the church, including the early revelation to Simeo Ondeto that polygamists could be baptised into the church. In this sense, the church is more willing to accept some cultural practices, but this is balanced by a strict sense of holiness. According to Dirven, there are also “rigorous and legalistic taboos to drinking, smoking, dancing and wearing shoes in holy places — trumpeted as the essence of a strict moral code.”
Gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Essentially Legio Maria is a spirit reliant religious movement. All the adherents respect the spirit as the guide of Legio. Even while the Simeo Ondeto and the Black Mary were still alive, it was possible for them to be in one place in Kenya while teaching and visiting other adherents through spirit delivered teachings of glossolalia and holy spirit possessing prophets to convey messages from them . It is a very serious offence to falsify the retelling of encounters with the holy ones in a glossolalia. Such actions could lead to an official rebuke from the priest, or even a beating, called a "chwat", from one’s local community.
The spirit also provide direction for the individuals in regard to spiritual discipline practices and outward garments. While many AICs require adherents to exclusively wear white robes when worshipping, the Legio Maria church encourages adherents to listen for messages from angels in their dreams in regard to the color of robe they should wear. Schwartz recounts the varied meanings of these dream inspired colours:
The spirit can lead Legios to acquire robes of yellow, a range of blues, purple, green, red, brown and other colours that are associated with various spiritual gifts and patron saints. Black is for ordained male priests (padri, pl. pate) and church mothers (madha, padri madhako, pl. mathe, pate mamon). Legio priests and church mothers wear black robes at requiem masses and at graveside services held in family compounds. At happier times, black prayer beads are worn or carried by church mothers and priests as a metonym of power and ordained status. A few non-ordained men and women said they had the black beads on their house altars because a dream had directed them to get the beads and pray with them at home. The dream-bestowed black beads were a source of quiet pride to these Legios.
It is through the spirit that the Legio Maria adherents can also receive direction for the more mundane decisions in life.
Headquarters and Holy Site.
The Legio Maria headquarters and center is St. Joseph church of Got Kwer,in Suna Migori. It is referred to as “Calvary” by Legio Maria adherents. This village of about 600 is approximately 15 km west of the southwestern Kenya town of Migori. Baba Simeo Ondeto's tomb is in this church, and is viewable as a long, cloth-covered plinth with numerous devotional objects scattered around. Both are maintained by a local community followers. Other major Legio Maria's most recognised places are Effeso Nzoia where Mama Maria's remains were buried; Kodero; Jerusalem Amoyo in Kadem; St. Teresa Kariobangi in Nairobi; St. Peter Manyatta in Kisumu.
Continuity and Discontinuity with Christianity.
The Legio Maria of African Mission Church can be seen in both continuity and discontinuity with orthodox Christianity. While one of the main critiques of the Legio Maria Church from other Christians centres on the claim that Simeo Ondeto is the “Black Messiah,” there are many ways in which the Legio Maria are in continuity with the Catholic Church.
First, the Legio Maria church recognises salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox theology is that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As we have seen in the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.
Second, the Legio Maria church recognises an active spiritual realm that needs to be dealt with to respond to evil and illness. It is God who gives gifts to people for spiritual healing, sometimes through the saints. The Legio specifically recognise the Catholic saints Catherine of Siena and Bernadette of Lourdes in regard to spiritual healing. The Saints Samson and Julian, and the angel Michael help to “guide Legios with gifts for exorcism and battling witchcraft. In seeking guidance from these holy ones they are in continuity with Catholic theology, but this theology is applied to traditional religious understandings of evil and illness.
As stated above, the Legio Maria church is also in continuity with the Catholic Church in its use of Catholic hymns and the Catholic mass. Many Legio Maria communities still celebrate the Latin form of the mass. In addition, original Legio songs are added that reinforce the particularity of the Legio Maria church.
Another sign of continuity with the Catholic Church is that the Legio Maria include a white Catholic priest, Father Philip Chefa, among their saints. Serving at the Asumbi Roman Catholic mission station in the 1930s,
Chefa was said to have practiced a highly charismatic form of Catholicism that addressed his parishioners’ concerns. He had engaged in healing, exorcism, and the burning of paraphernalia associated with ‘witchcraft’ and indigenous spirit-possession. Chefa had treated people who later became Legios well. He had established a chapter of the Roman Catholic Legion of Mary for Luo in 1938.
Not only does the Legio Maria Church acknowledge the Catholic saints as their own, but they have included some European priests who worked in Africa among their cloud of saints.

African Orthodox Church

The African Orthodox Church is a primarily African-American denomination founded in the United States in 1921. It has approximately 15 parishes and 5,000 members, down significantly from its peak membership.
Beliefs.
The AOC holds to the historic three-fold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons, and lays strong emphasis on apostolic succession. The church celebrates the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. Its worship is liturgical, of Eastern and Western rites. The Nicene, Apostles', and Athanasian creeds are affirmed.
History.
The African Orthodox Church (AOC) was founded in the belief that black Episcopalians should have a denomination of their own. Episcopal rector George Alexander McGuire was consecrated a bishop on September 28, 1921, in Chicago, Illinois, by Archbishop (episcopus vagans) Joseph Rene Vilatte, assisted by Bishop Carl A. Nybladh who had been consecrated by Vilatte. This placed Bishop McGuire in apostolic succession, which was something he had greatly desired.
The new denomination was originally called the Independent Episcopal Church, but at its first conclave, or House of Bishops meeting, on September 10, 1924, the denomination was formally organized as the African Orthodox Church. Bishop McGuire was unanimously elected archbishop and enthroned with the title of "Archbishop Alexander".
McGuire served for several years as chaplain of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA), founded and led by Marcus Garvey. When Garvey decided in 1924 to relocate UNIA headquarters to the West Indies, McGuire left the UNIA and began to devote himself to the development and extension of his church. Soon Endick Theological Seminary was founded, as well as an order of deaconesses, and the "Negro Churchman" magazine began publication with McGuire as its editor.
The United States Census Bureau's "Religious Bodies", 1926 edition, first reported one denomination "which now has a thriving organization of congregations" derived from Vilatte, that "aspires to ultimate association with Eastern Orthodox Churches as a racial or national unit" and "does not desire any association with Old Catholic Churches"—the . It had its episcopal see in New York City but incorporated in Florida. It claimed 13 organizations, with a membership of 1,508 without a church edifice. There was no organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was 30.
Another denomination first reported in "Religious Bodies", 1926 edition, named the African Orthodox Church of New York (AOCoNY) also had its episcopal see in New York City and incorporated in New York. The was in a fellowship "strictly one of spiritual communion" with the and a distinct organization with "absolute independence." It claimed three organizations, with a membership of 717 with one church edifice. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was not reported.
The African Orthodox Church originally attracted mostly Anglican West Indian immigrants. It spread to the South in 1925 when McGuire started a parish in West Palm Beach, Florida. Two years later he consecrated an African Daniel William Alexander as Primate of the Province of South Africa and central and southern Africa. At this time McGuire was elected as patriarch with the title of Alexander I. The church then spread to British Uganda and British Kenya, where it grew to about 10,000. A congregation also developed in Nassau, Bahamas. Its greatest strength, however, was in New York City where on November 8, 1931, McGuire dedicated Holy Cross Pro-Cathedral, a remodeled house purchased by McGuire from funds obtained by mortgaging his own home.
In 1932 a bishop of the church went to Uganda and ordained Ruben Spartus Mukasa and one of his associates there priests of the African Orthodox Church. However, a few years later, Mukasa and his followers decided to align with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Mukasa went to Alexandria and was ordained by the patriarch there, while the African Orthodox Church lost its connection in Uganda.
McGuire died on November 10, 1934. He was survived by his wife, Ada Robert McGuire, a native of Antigua, and a daughter. At the time of his death the church had about 30,000 members, about fifty clergy and thirty churches located in the United States, Africa, Canada (e.g. St Philip's, Whitney Pier, Nova Scotia), Cuba, Antigua and Venezuela.

Get Together (The Youngbloods song)

"Get Together", also known as "Let's Get Together", is a song written in the early 1960s by American singer-songwriter Chet Powers (aka Dino Valenti).
The song is an appeal for peace and brotherhood, presenting the polarity of love versus fear, and the choice to be made between them. It is best remembered for the impassioned plea in the lines of its refrain, which is repeated several times in succession to bring the song to its conclusion.
Recording history.
The song was originally recorded as "Let's Get Together" by The Kingston Trio and released on June 1, 1964, on their album "Back in Town". While it was not released as a single, this version was the first to bring the song to the attention of the general public. The Kingston Trio often performed it live.
A version of the song first broke into the top forty in 1965, when We Five, produced by Kingston Trio manager Frank Werber, released "Let's Get Together" as the follow-up to their top ten hit "You Were on My Mind." While it did not achieve the same level of success as the other, "Let's Get Together" provided the group with a second top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when it peaked at #31. It would be their last hit record.
Judy Collins performed the song live at the 1966 Newport Folk Festival and her version was included on a later album compiling highlights of various Newport Festivals.
From 1967-1969, "Get Together" was a staple in Joni Mitchell's shows, often playing the song as an encore.
The 1960s band HP LoveCraft also made a cover of the song.
In 1967, The Youngbloods released their version of the song under the title "Get Together." It became a minor Hot 100 hit for them, peaking at #62. However, renewed interest in the Youngbloods' version came when it was used in a radio public service announcement as a call for brotherhood by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The Youngbloods' version, the most-remembered today, was re-released in 1969, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The Dave Clark Five reached #8 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1970 with their version retitled "Everybody Get Together."
Controversy.
Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the media conglomerate company Clear Channel Communications included The Youngbloods' version of the song on a list of "lyrically questionable" songs that was sent to its 1200 radio stations in the United States.
In popular culture.
The Youngbloods version of the song has been featured in several films, including "Purple Haze", "Forrest Gump", Stephen King's "Riding the Bullet", "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and most recently "".
In The Simpsons episode "Treehouse of Horror II" Lisa wishes for world peace and her wish comes true. All people on Earth start singing ""Get Together"" and dance in a large peace sign. 
The "South Park" episode Smug Alert contains a parody of the song which repeats the line "come on people now" several times.

Opus sectile

Opus sectile is an art technique popularized in the ancient and medieval Roman world where materials were cut and inlaid into walls and floors to make a picture or pattern. Common materials were marble, mother of pearl, and glass. The materials were cut in thin pieces, polished, then trimmed further according to a chosen pattern. Unlike tessellated mosaic techniques, where the placement of very small uniformly sized pieces forms a picture, "opus sectile" pieces are much larger and can be shaped to define large parts of the design.
Origin.
Although early examples have been found from Egypt and Asia Minor, the most prominent artifacts remain from 4th century Rome. A large set from the Basilica of Junius Bassus survived, depicting an elaborate chariot and other things. The popularity of "opus sectile" decoration continued in Rome through the 6th century, and affected areas as far as Constantinople (now Istanbul in Turkey). Particularly remarkable are a series of "opus sectile" glass panels, found in a possible sanctuary of Isis at the eastern Corinthian port of Kenchreai, in excavations carried out in the 1960s; they have scenes of famous authors like Homer and Plato, scenes of Nilotic landscapes, harbour-front cities and geometric panels.
Later uses.
Although the technique died in Rome with the decline of the Empire, it continued to be used prominently in Byzantine churches, primarily in floor designs. From Byzantium it was eventually brought back to Sicily and the Italian mainland, in the 12th century as the Cosmatesque style, concentrating on geometric patterns. There was a major revival from the Italian Renaissance in the form of pietra dura work, although this normally consists of much smaller compositions and it is used on furniture, mainly. Architectural work from later periods tends to be called Intarsia. 
In England, the technique was revived in the late 19th century by artists working in the Arts and Crafts movement. Charles Hardgrave, whose designs were executed by James Powell & Sons at the Whitefriars Glass Works, was a noted designer in this technique.

Triple fff Brewery

The Triple fff Brewing Company Ltd is a small independent brewer of real ale based in Four Marks, Alton, Hampshire, England, founded in November 1997, and producing award-winning bitters, milds and stouts. They own two pubs, the Railway Arms in Alton and The White Lion in Aldershot.
Triple fff launched in 1997 by Graham Trott,and his partner Frank. Graham was a jobber, then paint sprayer by trade, and Frank had a small business changing windows. They were keen home brewers. People liked their brews and when they discovered that you did not need to be a chemist to brew beer commercially, they decided to have a go. They installed a 5 barrel plant in one of the units vacated by the now closed furniture factory on Station Approach in the village of Four Marks, in which factory Trott worked. The station still operates on the steam heritage Watercress Line which runs ten miles between Alton and Alresford.
Graham and Frank took a musical theme for their brewery name as triple fff is the strong note; louder, louder, louder. Some people found the name amusing, and referred to their beer as: Frank's Flushing Fluid. Franks' share of the business was bought out after a few years by Graham, with the help of his mother-in-law Eileen, who also helped financially with cask purchasing and various other necessities.
The beer names also came from song titles of many of the 60s rock icons, Van Morrison, Led Zeppelin and Cream with Moondance (4.2%ABV), Stairway (4.6%ABV) and the Pressed Rat and Warthog (3.8%ABV). The psychedelic 60s did not spawn a song called Alton Pride (3.8%ABV) but that joined the lyrical portfolio and is our number one seller following its success at 2008’s Great British Beer Festival having been voted Supreme Champion Beer of Britain.
The year 2000 saw an expansion into an 18 Barrel plant and finally in 2006 the brewery became what it is today, a 50 Barrel system brewing over 31,000 pints a week.
The brewery produces high quality real ale and has won over 35 industry awards, including overall Champion Beer of Britain at the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Great British Beer Festival. They attribute their success to fine ingredients, including Maris Otter Barley malted in the traditional way at Warminster Maltings. Their beers include:
A recent venture has been to produce a beer from a recipe by Gilbert White, the famous naturalist born in 1720 in nearby Selborne. The recipe uses hops and smoked barley.

Clachan

A clachan (, or , ; , ; , ) is a type of small traditional settlement common in Ireland and Scotland until the middle of the 20th century. Originally kirktowns, today they are usually defined as small villages lacking a church, post office, or other formal building. Their origin is unknown, but it is likely that they are of a very ancient root, most likely dating to medieval times. A true clachan would have been a cluster of small single-storey cottages of farmers and/or fishermen, invariably found on poorer land. They were related to the rundale system of farming. According to David Lloyd, The Great Famine in Ireland (1845–49) caused such disruption to the social system that the clachans virtually disappeared. In some cases, they have evolved into holiday villages, or one or two houses have taken over, turning smaller houses into agricultural outhouses. The remains can be seen in many upland and coastal areas. Sometimes they are clustered in a dip in the landscape, to protect from Atlantic winds, other times they stretch haphazardly along main roads.
Etymology.
The word is composed of two elements, "clach/cloch" meaning "stone" and the masculine diminutive suffix "-an/-án". It originally denoted one of two things:
This should not be confused with the Scottish Gaelic plural of "clach" which is "clachan" "stones", a homograph but not a homophone as it is pronounced /kʰl̪ˠaxən/.
Examples.
In Ireland:
In the meaning of "causeway", the most prominent example in Irish is the Giant's Causeway, known in Irish as "Clochán an Aifir" or "Clochán na bhFomhórach".
In Scotland, clachans can be found in Argyll and Bute, Highland Perthshire and in the Highland Council region but also elsewhere, for example:

Javier del Granado

Don Francisco Javier del Granado y Granado (27 February 1913 – 15 May 1996), was a poet laureate and favorite son of Bolivia.
Born into a distinguished family with a rich literary pedigree, he spent most of his youth on his family's hacienda near Arani, in the department of Cochabamba, Colpa-Ciaco, a colonial-era estate in existence since the 16th century. A quiet life filled with the joys of living in the countryside greatly influenced his works, which combine epic imagery and storytelling with bucolic settings as well as rural and indigenous themes and the use, in addition to Spanish, of indigenous languages, primarily Quechua (the language of the Incas). In its turn toward native subjects as well as in its use of a formal battery of traditional forms, such as the ballad and the sonnet, his extensive body of poetry has been compared with that of Mexico's preeminent man of letters Alfonso Reyes.
Bolivia's leading poetic light achieved widespread acclaim and recognition, receiving a multitude of national and international awards over a career that spanned more than half a century. His death was marked by three national days of mourning, and his funeral was a state event. Bolivia has dedicated a plaza and two avenues (one of them, La Paz's longest boulevard) in his honour, and put up a monument to his memory.
Poet of the Bolivian Revolution.
Along with Víctor Paz Estenssoro and others, del Granado formed the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario. The MNR was at the forefront of the Bolivian Revolution of 1952, which radically changed the country, bringing about land redistribution, universal suffrage, and nationalization of the major tin mines.
Granado family.
He comes from an esteemed literary family that traces its noble roots back in colonial America to that outstanding humanitarian figure who was the Count of Cotoca. His father, Félix del Granado, a notable writer in his own right and rector of the University of San Simón, founded the Bolivian Academies of Language and History. His uncle, the Venerable Francisco María del Granado, a man of deep compassion and a deeply spiritual and holy bishop, was also a gifted orator and writer. Particularly dedicated in his concern and love for the poor and Native Americans, he was instrumental in steering the Catholic Church amid a critical era of anticlerical persecution during the 19th century. Bolivian human-rights lawyer Juan del Granado is also a member of this family.

Chinthe

The Chinthe (, ; , ; , ) is a leogryph (lion-like creature) that is often seen at the entrances of pagodas and temples in Burma and other Southeast Asian countries. The chinthe is featured prominently on the kyat, the currency of Burma. The chinthe is almost always depicted in pairs, and serve to protect the pagoda. They typically appear as animals, but are sometimes found with human faces.
Pagoda guardians.
The story of why chinthes guard the entrances of pagodas and temples are given as such: 
A princess had a son through her marriage to a lion, but later abandoned the lion who then became enraged and set out on a road of terror throughout the lands. The son then went out to slay this terrorizing lion. The son came back home to his mother stating he slew the lion, and then found out that he killed his own father. The son later constructed a statue of the lion as a guardian of a temple to atone for his sin.
The chinthe is revered and loved by the Burmese people and is used symbolically on the royal thrones of Burma. Predating the use of coins for money, brass weights cast in the shape of mythical beasts like the chinthe were commonly used to measure standard quantities of staple items.
Manussiha.
The manussiha ( "manothiha", "manuk siha"), a combination of Pali "manussa" (man) and "siha" (lion) is a half-lion half-man mythical creature that is symbolic of a guardian, usually found guarding the four corners of a pagoda. It has a human head and torso and lion hindquarters. It is comparable to the sphinx.
Relation to Second World War Chindits.
During the Second World War, the British Brigadier Orde Wingate was given command of forces charged with Long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines in Burma. At the suggestion of Captain Aung Thin of the Burma Rifles, Wingate decided to call this force "The Chinthes" - a name which became corrupted to "The Chindits" and is as such remembered in the annals of WWII.

She is the 9th highest scorer in Tennessee Volunteers women's basketball history (1,806). Shanna wore a No. 1 jersey during most of her junior year in honor of her teammate and best friend, Sidney Spencer, who missed the majority of the season after tearing her ACL.
WNBA career.
San Antonio Silver Stars.
On April 5, 2006, Zolman was drafted by the San Antonio Silver Stars in the second round (No. 16 overall) of the 2006 WNBA Draft. In her rookie season, Zolman played in all 34 regular season games finishing a solid rookie season averaging 6.6 points per game while playing 16.1 minutes per game. She ranked 13th in the WNBA in 3 Point Percentage (.378). She scored a career high 18 points against the Phoenix Mercury on August 12, 2006. The San Antonio Silver Stars finished 13–21 on the season, missing the playoffs.
During the 2007 WNBA season, Zolman played in all 34 regular season games, starting one, making her the only Silver Stars player to have appeared in every game for the last two seasons. She averaged 9.2 points, 1.4 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 0.41 steals per game. Zolman also tied a franchise record for 3-pointers made in a game after hitting 7 of 11 3-pt field goal attempts on Aug. 2 against the Phoenix Mercury (also ties for second in WNBA history).
On August 30, 2007, Zolman played a key role in the waning moments of the Phoenix Mercury's controversial victory over the Silver Stars in Game 1 of the WNBA Western Conference Finals. After Becky Hammon hit a three-point shot to tie the game with approximately three seconds left in regulation, Phoenix attempted to drive for a final basket. Phoenix guard Cappie Pondexter fell to the floor in the backcourt under defensive pressure from Zolman. Zolman was called for a reach-in foul with 2.1 seconds remaining, and in turn Pondexter made two free throws and Phoenix won the game, 102–100. ESPN announcers and many fans questioned the call, because video footage arguably indicated that Pondexter had merely slipped and Zolman had committed no foul. Additionally, the replay also showed that Shanna's jab step toward Pondexter is what caused Cappie to falter, and since there wasn't any contact made, the correct call should have been a traveling violation on Phoenix; in effect, a great defensive play by Shanna Zolman. Mercury fans, however, felt the call was appropriate. While most objective fans consider it to be one of the worst calls in WNBA history. The head official reviewed the call to determine how much time remained on the clock, but WNBA rules do not permit instant replay review of whether a foul was committed. At the post game press conference, Hammon stated that Zolman did nothing wrong and that the officials made a mistake. Lost in all this, is that Zolman came within an eyelash of sinking a 75 foot shot at the buzzer to make the issue moot. But, it bounced off the rim. Determined to make good, Shanna came out of the gate sizzling hot in Game 2, scoring 17 first half points including 5 three pointers. She finished the game with 20 points, including 6 three pointers, as the Silver Stars were defeated 98–92.
During the 2008 WNBA Preseason, Zolman tore the Anterior Cruciate Ligament in her left knee during May 12, 2008, contest with the Detroit Shock. Zolman injured her knee during San Antonio’s second offensive possession of the game. After the season-ending injury, Zolman had a successful surgery to repair the torn ligament. She made her return from injury on May 30, 2009 in a preseason game against the Detroit Shock. Crossley was traded to the Tulsa Shock on April 14, 2010. After playing for Tulsa in 2010, she suffered a torn ACL while playing in Turkey and underwent successful surgery on January 26, 2011. After rehabbing her knee Zolman was in the 2012 Shock training camp but was cut from the team after playing 10 minutes in one preseason game. Zolman then retired from basketball.
Personal Life off the court.
During the 2006 WNBA offseason, On October 14, 2006, Shanna married her college sweetheart, former University of Tennessee fullback Andrew David Crossley (b. August 4, 1980), whom she met at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. However and since they have been divorced, Shanna has decided to go back to her maiden name of Zolman.
Zolman is a strong believer in community service, she has volunteered her time with Race for the Cure, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Dogwood Arts Parade, the Toyota Literacy program and singing Christmas carols at area nursing homes.
Shanna is an active member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. She has served as the spokesperson for the 2006 Silver Stars 5K Run/Walk.
Beginning in 2008, Zolman created the All Things Basketball Camp, an annual event for 5th–12th grade girls in the San Antonio area. During the offseason, she resides in Seattle, Washington.
While announcing that she had retired from basketball, Zolman said that she would work with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes doing ministry and mentoring, and that the work had made the transition from playing basketball much easier than she had anticipated. "I love ministry and I love mentoring. It’s a huge passion of mine. I prayed that I would find something that I had a passion greater than basketball for and God had a plan for me."

Michael (Khoroshy)

Metropolitan Michael, (secular name Theodot Nykyforovych Khoroshy; 10 July 1885, Fyodorovka, near Chigirin, Russian Empire – May 5, 1977, Toronto) was a bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada from 1951–1977, and the Church's Metropolitan from 1973 until his resignation in 1975.
Ukraine.
Theodot Khoroshy began his early education in his village. Later he moved on to the pedagogical seminary in the town of Shamovka in the Kherson region of Ukraine. Following that, he studied at the Theological Seminary and the Faculty of History-Philology of St. Vladimir's Seminary in Kiev.
In December 1912, Bishop Nicodemus ordained young Theodot a deacon.
During the next few years, he translated the Liturgical Psalter into Ukrainian.
On April 24, 1920, Bishop Dimitrius (Verbitsky) ordained him a priest, and in the following months he was appointed Dean of a church in Ternivka, in the Cherkasy region.
After the formation of the non-canonical Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church joined its ranks.
Due to his clerical work, in 1923 Fr. Theodot was appointed the Dean of the Cathedral of Cherkasy.
At this time the Bolshevik occupation, clergy were pressured to deny their vocation, Fr. Theodot was a great soldier of Christ, and was unshaken. The communist authorities arrested Fr. Theodot in September 1929, after which he was condemned to eight years in concentration camps in the far north: first on the Kola peninsula on the White Sea, then the "Island of Death": Kond, and a year later to Solovky. In the fall of 1932 he was transferred to the camps of Ukhta-Pechersk for further punishment. Following his release in 1937, Fr. Theodot returned to the Donbas area in Ukraine and established himself in Kirovograd.
Episcopacy.
German Nazi occupation of Ukraine in 1941 bring relative religious freedom. In Kirovohrad, Fr. Theodot organized a Higher Church Government, and in March 1942 he was elected a candidate for the Episcopate. With the blessing of the Administrator of the Warsaw Metropolia in the freed Ukrainian lands, headed by Archbishop Polikarp (Sikorsky), Bishops Nikanor and Ihor, tonsured Fr. Theodot a monk on May 12, 1942. He was given the name "Michael and ordained into the episcopate as the Bishop of Kirovohrad at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Kiev.
In November 1942 Bishop Michael was elevated to archbishop of the Kirovohrad Diocese. Archbishop Michael was transferred to the Mykolayiv Diocese due to pressure from German authorities. By the conclusion of the war in 1945, Arcbishop Michael had travelled widely across Europe: to Odessa, Akerman, Galac, Vienna, Warsaw, and throughout Germany and Slovakia. He was allowed to continue his pastoral work for the Ukrainian Orthodox, particularly amongst captives, expatriated workers, and refugees. With the blessing of Metropolitan Polikarp, Archbishop Michael was given the responsibility to look after the Ukrainian Orthodox flock in Bavaria, with its headquarters in Munich.
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.
Within a few years, with Metropolitan Polikarp's blessing, the Consistory of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada invited Archbishop Michael to become her ruling bishop. On May 14, 1951, Archbishop Michael came to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (the Church's Headquarters). However, with the arrival of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) also in 1951, the UOCC decided to use the higher ranking bishop (Ilarion) as "Metropolitan of Winnipeg and the Central Diocese, Metropolitan of all Canada, and Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada." Archbishop Michael was instead assigned as "Archbishop of Toronto and the Eastern Diocese." Archbishop Michael was the first Bishop of Toronto. Under his guidance, nineteen new churches were constructed.
In 1970, Metropolitan Ilarion had become ill, and Archbishop Michael became "Acting Primate" of the UOCC. When Metropolitan Ilarion reposed in March 1972, Archbishop Michael was elected Primate of the Church and was installed as Metropolitan in 1973. However, during the XV Sobor in 1975, Michael resigned as Metropolitan, stating that he wished to remain as the head of the Eastern Diocese.
Metropolitan Michael died on May 5, 1977 in Toronto, at the age of 91. Buried in the Prospect Cemetery in Toronto.
Metropolitan Michael always had a keen concern for the spiritual education of his faithful and especially of the children. He wrote theological works, translated the Psalter, the Horologion (the Book of Hours), and a number of other works into Ukrainian. He also composed music for the services of vespers, matins, and the Divine Liturgy. He was a confessor of the Orthodox Faith and a zealous archpastor. Metropolitan Andrew (Metiuk) said at his graveside: "He was a great intercessor before our Lord God, and for his people and his Church."

Cheez Doodles

Cheez Doodles are a cheese-flavored cheese puff produced by Wise Foods which are similar to Frito-Lay's Cheetos. They debuted several years after Frito-Lay's snack in the 1950s. Originally developed and manufactured by King Kone Corp. of the Bronx (owned and operated by Morrie Yohai), it became the prevalent cheese puff snack on the East Coast. In the mid-1960s the company (now known as Old London Foods) was acquired by Borden and assigned to the Wise potato chip division. Cheez Doodles remain one of the strongest brands marketed by Wise, which is no longer part of Borden.
Like Cheetos, Cheez Doodles were produced in many varieties. The currently available versions include:
Wise recently made their Crunchy Cheez Doodles "cheezier," more akin to Cheetos' flavor.
They have recently entered pop culture as the preferred snack of ESPN NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith, and are the favourite snack of Lincoln Peirce's comic character "Big Nate".
Cheez Doodles were also featured in two episodes of the HBO series How to Make It in America's first season.

<doc id="5968131" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5968131" title="Waveshaper">
Waveshaper

In electronic music waveshaping is a type of distortion synthesis in which complex spectra are produced from simple tones by altering the shape of the waveforms.
Uses.
Waveshapers are used mainly by electronic musicians to achieve an extra-abrasive sound. This effect is most used to enhance the sound of a music synthesizer by altering the waveform or vowel. Rock musicians may also use a waveshaper for heavy distortion of a guitar or bass. Some synthesizers or virtual software instruments have built-in waveshapers. The effect can make instruments sound noisy or overdriven.
In digital modeling of analog audio equipment such as tube amplifiers, waveshaping is used to introduce a static, or memoryless, nonlinearity to approximate the transfer characteristic of a vacuum tube or diode limiter.
How it works.
A waveshaper is an audio effect that changes an audio signal by mapping an input signal to the output signal by applying a fixed or variable mathematical function, called the "shaping function" or "transfer function", to the input signal (the term shaping function is preferred to avoid confusion with the transfer function from systems theory). The function can be any function at all.
Mathematically, the operation is defined by the "waveshaper equation"
where "f" is the shaping function, "x(t)" is the input function, and "a(t)" is the "index function", which in general may vary as a function of time. This parameter "a" is often used as a constant gain factor called the "distortion index". In practice, the input to the waveshaper, x, is considered on [-1,1] for digitally sampled signals, and f will be designed such that y is also on [-1,1] to prevent unwanted clipping in software.
Commonly used shaping functions.
Sin, arctan, polynomial functions, or piecewise functions (such as the hard clipping function) are commonly used as waveshaping transfer functions. It is also possible to use table-driven functions, consisting of discrete points with some degree of interpolation or linear segments.
Polynomials.
A polynomial is a function of the form 
formula_2
Polynomial functions are convenient as shaping functions because, when given a single sinusoid as input, a polynomial of degree "N" will only introduce up to the "N"th harmonic of the sinusoid. To prove this, consider a sinusoid used as input to the general polynomial.
Next, use the inverse Euler's formula to obtain complex sinusoids.
Finally, use the binomial formula to transform back to trigonometric form and find coefficients for each harmonic.
formula_6
From the above equation, several observations can be made about the effect of a polynomial shaping function on a single sinusoid:
Problems associated with waveshapers.
The sound produced by digital waveshapers tends to be harsh and unattractive, because of problems with aliasing. Waveshaping is a non-linear operation, so it's hard to generalize about the effect of a waveshaping function on an input signal. The mathematics of non-linear operations on audio signals is difficult, and not well understood. The effect will be amplitude-dependent, among other things. But generally, waveshapers—particularly those with sharp corners (e.g., some derivatives are discontinuous) -- tend to introduce large numbers of high frequency harmonics. If these introduced harmonics exceed the nyquist limit, then they will be heard as harsh inharmonic content with a distinctly metallic sound in the output signal. Supersampling can somewhat but not completely alleviate this problem, depending on how fast the introduced harmonics fall off. Supersampling involves the following procedure:
With relatively simple, and relatively smooth waveshaping functions (sin(a*x), atan(a*x), polynomial functions, for example), this procedure may reduce aliased content in the harmonic signal to the point that it is musically acceptable. But waveshaping functions other than polynomial waveshaping functions will introduce an infinite number of harmonics into the signal, some which may audibly alias even at the supersampled frequency.

Robert May's School

Robert May's School is a coeducational secondary school with academy status, located in the village of Odiham, Hampshire, England. The school was founded in 1694 with donations from the will of Robert May, a local man. 
History.
In 1920, the Local Education Authority decreed that teachers' salaries should be increased and the Director of Education wrote to the Governors saying that he could not afford the ever-increasing financial support to the school. Following a report by an inspector later in the year that the school could soon face difficulties, the decision was taken to transfer complete control of the school to the County.
The start of the Second World War in September 1939 resulted in air raid shelters being dug, delaying the start of term. During the war, the school day had to end earlier, due to the blackout, and a total of 151 air raid warnings were sounded in the first year alone. An enemy bomb landed close to the school in 1940 but no-one was hurt.
The grammar school was closed down in 1950, despite vigorous local protests and a petition to the government carrying 1,000 signatures. Funding for building work on the school site was approved in 1952 and was completed in 1957, when the school was reopened as a Secondary Modern School with 265 pupils. A formal opening ceremony took place in 1958.
The school was reorganised again in the 1970s into a Comprehensive School, with new school buildings constructed by 1975. The new site was designed for 690 pupils and had a central courtyard, concert hall, office, dining area and kitchen, with separate blocks for craft workshops and music. In the first year the new school took in five hundred and three pupils. More buildings were constructed in 1978, linked to the rest of the building by walkways. More business studies and computer facilities, as well as a new library, were added in 1987. The Music block was rebuilt in 1993/94. A new English block followed soon after, as did a new Maths block in 2002, in order to allow the school to cope with its high intake. Following a successful application, the school then became a Specialist School in Science with Mathematics and Computing.
The school converted to academy status on 1 May 2012.
Demographics.
Pupils come from the surrounding area, including the villages of Upton Grey, Greywell, Hook, Hartley Wintney and Odiham. The vast majority of pupils are of white ethnicity and British backgrounds and there are very few pupils who speak English as a second language. The number of pupils eligible for free school meals or who have disabilities is below average.
Extra-curricular activities.
A wide range of free extracurricular activities are run after school hours on five days of the week, with special buses for pupils involved to return home afterwards. The choice available has been described as "exceptional" by a school inspection.
From Year 7, students can take part in exchange trips with partner schools in France and Germany, as well as other trips to ski resorts and residential trips such as recent trips to Iceland and an annual Italy Trip to Rome and Sorrento.
The school has run productions since 1921 and almost annually since 1977.

Émile Veinante (12 June 1907 in Metz – 18 November 1983 in Dury, Somme) was a French footballer and coach. 
Veinante was primarily a forward. He began his club career in 1916 with the youth squad at FC Metz, which was at that time (before the end of the First World War) still in German-controlled Alsace-Lorraine. He stayed with FC Metz until 1929, when he moved to Racing Club de Paris in the French first division from 1929–1940, with whom he won the French Double in 1936, winning the national championship and the cup title. He was named French player of the year in that year. He retired from professional club soccer in 1940.
Between February 1929 and January 1940 Veinante played 24 international matches for the French national team, scoring 14 goals. He appeared in the 1930 and 1938 World Cups, and as a reserve in 1934. In 1938, against Belgium, he scored a goal in the first minute of play.
In 1940 Veinante became manager of Racing Paris, until 1943. He also managed Racing Club de Strasbourg from 1945–1947 and 1948–49, OGC Nice in 1949–50, FC Metz in 1950–51, FC Nantes from 1951–1955, and RC Strasbourg again in 1960–61.

Brighton Centre is the largest conference and exhibition centre in southern England, and is regularly used for conferences of the British political parties and other bodies of national importance. The venue has the capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 delegates, although rooms in the building can be used for weddings and banquets. It has also been used as a live music venue since it was opened by the then prime minister James Callaghan on 19 September 1977.
The venue is situated in the centre of Brighton on the sea front and is within 200 metres of major hotels. In 2004, it was estimated that the centre generates £50 million in revenue for Brighton.
The second phase of redevelopment was completed in January 2012; a refurbishment of its main entrance resulted in a transformation of its outside façade. In addition to this, the venue’s restaurant, which is regularly used as a relaxation space for larger conferences, now features floor-to-ceiling windows with uninterrupted views of the seafront and new interiors.

Needle (comics)

The Needle is a comic book character. He is a mutant supervillain in Marvel Comics' main shared universe. Created by Mark Gruenwald, Carmine Infantino, and Al Gordon, the character first appeared in "Spider-Woman" #9 (December 1978).
Publication history.
The character's origin was recounted in his debut appearance in "Spider-Woman" #9.
Creator Mark Gruenwald brought the character back during his run on the "West Coast Avengers" as a member of the villain team Night Shift, which included other former Spider-Woman foes.
Fictional character biography.
After being mugged one night while leaving work, Josef Saint, an elderly tailor, lost an eye and his ability to speak. While recuperating, he discovered that he has the power to paralyze with his gaze. Seeking revenge, Saint assumed the guise of the vigilante the Needle. Armed with a yard-long needle, the mute villain attacked young men on the streets at night, sewing their mouths shut. After victimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jerry Hunt, the Needle incurred the wrath of Spider-Woman, the agent's girlfriend, and she took him out with a close-range venom blast. He was subsequently arrested.
With other superhuman adventurers and criminals, the Needle was imprisoned by the Locksmith, but then freed by Spider-Woman.
The Needle joined the Night Shift, and teamed with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates. Alongside the Night Shift, he tested Moon Knight to take over as the leader of the Night Shift. Later, alongside the Night Shift, he battled the West Coast Avengers. Alongside the Night Shift, the second Hangman, and Satannish, he battled the Avengers West Coast; his abilities had been enhanced by Satannish's black magic.
The Needle was later defeated by Armory.
Needle appears with the Night Shift, as part of the Hood's gang. They battle the Midnight Sons, and Needle impales Daimon Hellstrom with his needle, before Jennifer Kale knocks him off with a spell. He and the Night Shift are killed when the zombie virus mutates and becomes airborne. The virus cloud begins to rain blood, and reanimates the Night Shift as zombies. Dormammu assumes control of the Night Shift and uses them to fight the Midnight Sons. When Jennifer Kale and the Black Talon contain the virus within the Zombie (Simon Garth), the Night Shift members are apparently restored to normal, and the Hood teleports away with them.
Powers and abilities.
Needle has the ability to hypnotically paralyze a victim with his gaze, and is also gifted with enhanced agility and strength. The Needle is mute and mentally disturbed. He is an expert tailor.
The Needle is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and carries a needle-like weapon over long.
For a time, the Needle's powers were enhanced by Satannish, increasing his physical attributes to that of an athletic man, allowing his hypnotic gaze to work instantaneously, and rendering his weapon sharp enough to rend cinder block.

Premonitions (novel)

Premonitions is a young adult novel by Jude Watson, first published in 2005, in which a teenage girl has to cope with disturbing visions.
Plot summary.
Gracie knows when bad things are about to happen. Or sometimes when they have already happened. She begged her mother not to leave for a trip that ended with her dying when her car was hit by a truck delivering oranges, and now, living in Washington with her aunt Shay, Gracie has visions that involve her best friend Emily. Gracie would prefer that her psychic powers did not exist, but when Emily disappears, she has to use every vision she gets as a clue to solving the mystery.
The problem with Gracie's visions is that she does not know exactly what she is seeing. Sometimes she sees the past, sometimes the present, and sometimes she misinterprets her visions completely. Assisted by her cousin Diego, Gracie follows her visions in hopes of finding Emily. After a few false starts and a little research, she finds Emily's trail and is taken captive by Emily's kidnapper. Trapped in a guarded and gloomy house, Gracie begins to see the dark childhood of her kidnapper and his kins in unstoppable visions, the kidnapper is a madman who regrets not saving his ill sister Nell. This leads to the house being set ablaze by his enraged father and most of his brothers and sisters are killed in the fire including his dear sister Lizbet. This disillusioned madman wants to end this properly this time and so plans to die with his foster 'family'.
Characters.
Gracie: The main character who has psychic abilities. The book is from her point of view.
Shay: Gracie's aunt who, after a while, Gracie comes to like. She likes to cook and tries to make Gracie welcomed in her house.
Diego: Gracie's cousin, who until Emily disappears does not talk to Gracie much.
Supporting characters.
