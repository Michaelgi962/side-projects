Wetland methane emissions

As one of the most significant natural sources of atmospheric methane, wetlands remain a major area of concern with respect to climate change. Wetlands are characterized by water-logged soils and distinctive communities of plant and animal species that have evolved and adapted to the constant presence of water. Due to this high level of water saturation as well as warm weather, wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of atmospheric methane. 
Most methanogenesis, or methane production, occurs in oxygen poor environments. Because the microbes that live in warm, moist environments consume oxygen more rapidly than it can diffuse in from the atmosphere, wetlands are the ideal anaerobic, or oxygen poor, environments for fermentation. 
Fermentation is a process used by certain kinds of microorganisms to break down essential nutrients. In a process called acetoclastic methanogenesis, microorganisms from the classification domain archaea produce methane by fermenting acetate and H2-CO2 into methane and carbon dioxide. 
H3C-COOH → CH4 + CO2
Depending on the wetland and type of archaea, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, another process that yields methane, can also occur. This process occurs as a result of archaea oxidizing hydrogen with carbon dioxide to yield methane and water. 
4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O
Natural progressions of wetlands.
Many different kinds of wetlands exist, all characterized by unique compositions of plant life and water conditions. To list a few, marshes, swamps, bogs, fens, peatlands, muskegs, and pocosins are all examples of different kinds of wetlands. Because each type of wetland is unique, the same characteristics used to classify each wetland can also be used to characterize the amount of methane emitted from that particular wetland. Any waterlogged environment with moderate levels of decomposition create the anaerobic conditions needed for methanogenesis, but the amount of water and decomposition will affect the magnitude of methane emissions in a specific environment. For example, lower water tables result in lower levels of methane emission because any methane produced has to get past the multitude of methanotrophic bacteria that make their home in soil in order to make it to the atmosphere. Higher water tables, however, result in higher levels of methane emission because there is less habitable area for methanotrophic bacteria to live, and thus the methane can more easily diffuse into the atmosphere without being broken down. 
Often, the natural ecological progression of wetlands involves the development of one kind of wetland into one or several other kinds of wetlands. So over time, a wetland will naturally change the amount of methane emitted from its soil. 
For example, Peatlands are wetlands that contain a large amount of peat, or partially decayed plant life. When peatlands are first developing, they often start out as fens, wetlands characterized by mineral rich soil. These flooded wetlands, with higher water tables, would naturally have higher emissions of methane. Eventually, the fens develop into bogs, acidic wetlands with accumulations of peat and lower water tables. With the lower water tables, methane emissions are more easily consumed by methanotrophic, or methane consuming, bacteria and never make it to the atmosphere. Over time, the peatlands develop and end up with accumulated pools of water, which once again increases emissions of methane.
Pathways of methane emission in wetlands.
Primary productivity fuels methane emissions both directly and indirectly. Plants not only provide much of the carbon needed for methane producing processes in wetlands, but in addition, methane can utilize three different pathways provided by primary productivity to reach the atmosphere: diffusion through the profile, plant aerenchyma, and ebullition.
Diffusion.
Diffusion through the profile refers to the movement of methane up through soil and bodies of water to reach the atmosphere. The importance of diffusion as a pathway varies per wetland based on the type of soil and vegetation. For example, in peatlands, the mass amount of dead, but not decaying, organic matter results in relatively slow diffusion of methane through the soil. Additionally, because methane can travel more quickly through soil than water, diffusion plays a much bigger role in wetlands with drier, more loosely compacted soil.
Aerenchyma.
Plant aerenchyma refers to the vessel-like transport tubes within the tissues of certain kinds of plants. Plants with arenchyma possess porous tissue that allows for direct travel of gases to and from the plant roots. Methane can travel directly up from the soil into the atmosphere using this transport system. The direct “shunt” created by the aerenchyma allows for methane to bypass oxidation by oxygen that is also transported by the plants to their roots.
Ebullition.
Ebullition refers to the sudden release of bubbles of methane into the air. These bubbles occur as a result of methane building up over time in the soil, forming pockets of methane gas. As these pockets of trapped methane grow in size, the level of the soil will slowly rise up as well. This phenomenon continues until so much pressure builds up that the bubble “pops,” transporting the methane up through the soil so quickly that it does not have time to be consumed by the methanotrophic organisms in the soil. With this release of gas, the level of soil then falls once more. 
Ebullition in wetlands can be recorded by delicate sensors, called piezometers, that can detect the presence of pressure pockets within the soil. Hydraulic heads are also used to detect the subtle rising and falling of the soil as a result of pressure build up and release. Using piezometers and hydraulic heads, a study was done in northern United States peatlands to determine the significance of ebullition as a source of methane. Not only was it determined that ebullition is in fact a significant source of methane emissions in northern United States peatlands, but it was also observed that there was an increase in pressure after significant rainfall, suggesting that rainfall is directly related to methane emissions in wetlands.
Controlling factors on methane emission from wetlands.
The magnitude of methane emission from a wetland are usually measured using eddy covariance, gradient or chamber flux techniques, and depends upon several factors, including water table, comparative ratios of methanogenic bacteria to methanotrophic bacteria, transport mechanisms, temperature, substrate type, plant life, and climate. These factors work together to effect and control methane flux in wetlands. 
Overall the main determinant of net flux of methane into the atmosphere is the ratio of methane produced by methanogenic bacteria that makes it to the surface relative to the amount of methane that is either consumed by methanotrophic bacteria or oxidized and lost before reaching the atmosphere. This ratio is in turn affected by the other controlling factors of methane in the environment. Additionally, pathways of methane emission affect how the methane travels into the atmosphere and thus have an equal effect on methane flux in wetlands.
Water table.
The first controlling factor to consider is the level of the water table. Not only does pool and water table location determine the areas where methane production or oxidation may take place, but it also determines how quickly methane can diffuse into the air. When traveling through water, the methane molecules run into the quickly moving water molecules and thus take a longer time to reach the surface. Travel through soil, however, is much easier and results in easier diffusion into the atmosphere. This theory of movement is supported by observations made in wetlands where significant fluxes of methane occurred after a drop in the water table due to drought. If the water table is at or above the surface, then methane transport begins to take place primarily through ebullition and vascular or pressurized plant mediated transport, with high levels of emission occurring during the day from plants that use pressurized ventilation.
Temperature.
Temperature is also an important factor to consider as the environmental temperature—and temperature of the soil in particular—affects the metabolic rate of production or consumption by bacteria. Additionally, because methane fluxes occur annually with the seasons, evidence is provided that suggests that the temperature changing coupled with water table level work together to cause and control the seasonal cycles.
Substrate composition.
The composition of soil and substrate availability change the nutrients available for methanogenic and methanotrophic bacteria, and thus directly affects the rate of methane production and consumption. For example, wetlands soils with high levels of acetate or hydrogen and carbon dioxide are conducive to methane production. Additionally, the type of plant life and amount of plant decomposition affects the nutrients available to the bacteria as well as the acidity. A constant availability of cellulose and a soil pH of about 6.0 have been determined to provide optimum conditions for methane production and consumption; however, substrate quality can be overridden by other factors. Soil pH and composition must still be compared to the effects of water table and temperature.
Net ecosystem production.
Net ecosystem production (NEP) and climate changes are the all encompassing factors that have been shown to have a direct relationship with methane emissions from wetlands. In wetlands with high water tables, NEP has been shown to increase and decrease with methane emissions, most likely due to the fact that both NEP and methane emissions flux with substrate availability and soil composition. In wetlands with lower water tables, the movement of oxygen in and out of the soil can increase the oxidation of methane and the inhibition of methanogenesis, nulling the relationship between methane emission and NEP because methane production becomes dependent upon factors deep within the soil. 
A changing climate affects many factors within the ecosystem, including water table, temperature, and plant composition within the wetland—all factors that affect methane emissions. However, climate change can also affect the amount of carbon dioxide in the surrounding atmosphere, which would in turn decrease the addition of methane into the atmosphere, as shown by an 80% decrease in methane flux in areas of doubled carbon dioxide levels.
Human development of wetlands.
Humans often drain wetlands in the name of development, housing, and agriculture. By draining wetlands, the water table is thus lowered, increasing consumption of methane by the methanotrophic bacteria in the soil. However, as a result of draining, water saturated ditches develop, which due to the warm, moist environment, end up emitting a large amount of methane. Therefore the actual effect on methane emission strongly ends up depending on several factors. If the drains are not spaced far enough apart, then saturated ditches will form, creating mini wetland environments. Additionally, if the water table is lowered significantly enough, then the wetland can actually be transformed from a source of methane into a sink that consumes methane. Finally, the actual composition of the original wetland changes how the surrounding environment is affected by the draining and human development.

DFS Weihe

The DFS Weihe (English: "Harrier") is a German single-seat, high-wing, 18 metre wingspan, high-performance glider that was designed by Hans Jacobs in 1937-38. 
Design and development.
Jacobs designed the Weihe to be the pre-eminent performance glider of its era and indeed it captured many championships and set many records, until its performance was surpassed at the end of the 1950s. Even today it is considered one of the "classic sailplane designs".
The Weihe is of wooden construction with fabric covering on the wing trailing edges and the control surfaces. The spar is built from Baltic Pine, with a birch leading edge D-box, the fuselage and the fixed portions of the tail surfaces. The airfoil is a modified Gö 549-M.2 section. Early versions took off from a dolly and landed on a fixed skid, while later versions has a fixed wheel and skid undercarriage. Originally fitted with DFS-style airbrakes, some were later modified for Schempp-Hirth style brakes instead. The aircraft incorporates a unique rigging system which was widely copied in later gliders.
Initially the aircraft was produced by Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS) (English: "German Research Institute for Soaring Flight") and later by Jacobs-Schweyer. Post World War II it was produced by Focke-Wulf as well as in France, Spain, Sweden and Yugoslavia. Production of the Weihe totaled over 400 aircraft.
Operational history.
The Weihe won the World Gliding Championships in 1948 and 1950. It was used to set many world and national records, including the world record for altitude gain in 1959 of .
Dick Johnson won the US National Soaring Championships in 1959, flying a Weihe.

Cipotegato

The Cipotegato is the most universal tradition of Tarazona and takes place each year between 27 August and 1 September. The festivities in honor of the patron Saint Atilano, were declared of Regional Interest in 1998 and National Interest in 2009. Turasionense mythical character hooded and dressed as harlequin with the colors yellow, red and green. The main day of the fiestas of Tarazona, a few hours before noon, he stepped into the square through an open corridor through the crowd of friends and former Cipotegatos. Crossing the square, is pursued by the crowd that throws tomatoes. If he comes out victorious, it will be uploaded to the sculpture erected in his honor at the square. The Cipotegato is elected annually by drawing lots among the youth population.
History.
Tarazona had an annual tradition where, during fiestas, a prisoner from the local prison was given an opportunity to win freedom. The prisoner was given a stick with a string that ended in a ball (simlar to what the Cipotegato currently carries), and was instructed that if he could leave the town was he would be free. The prisoner was then released in the middle of the town square, where the townsfolk would pelt the prisoner with stones as the prisoner attempted to escape the town.

Berkeley APEC Study Center

The Berkeley APEC Study Center (BASC) is a research center at the University of California, Berkeley. Created in 1996 in response to an initiative by U.S. President Bill Clinton, the center undertakes research, disseminates information and facilitates discussion on APEC-related issues involving political, economic and business trends in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Berkeley center is part of the APEC Study Centers Consortium (ASCC), a network of over a hundred research institutions and university centers across twenty APEC member economies. In addition to the Berkeley center, sister APEC centers are headquartered at Columbia University, Brown University, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, Hong Kong University, Kobe University, Nankai University, and the University of Indonesia. For the past several years, the Berkeley center has served as co-chair of the U.S. Consortium of APEC Study Centers.
Since its establishment, the center has published over a dozen volumes related to trade and economy in the Asia-Pacific region. It sponsors conferences, symposia, and visiting lecturers. In addition to participating in ASCC conferences in Australia, Peru, Singapore, and Japan, the center has hosted conferences pertaining to the rise of China and the economic resurgence of Russia on the UC Berkeley and Stanford University campuses.
History and mission.
The University of California, Berkeley established the APEC Study Center in October 1996 at the request of the U.S. Department of State in response to the APEC Leaders' Education Initiative introduced by President Bill Clinton. The initiative was endorsed on November 20, 1993 by the leaders of the other APEC member nations at their historic meeting "held in a Native American-style long house on Blake Island, a state park in Puget Sound, in Kitsap County" near Seattle. This initiative called on institutions of higher education in the United States and throughout the Asia-Pacific region to collaborate on "Asia-Pacific policy research, and through exchanges, joint research, conferences and other contacts, to help establish an emerging region-wide network of personal and institutional relationships for all member economies." Conducting policy research on Asia-Pacific issues and exchanging ideas and technologies, students and scholars engaged in advanced studies of regional economic importance became the guidelines for BASC's research agenda.
BASC conducts multidisciplinary research activities that analyze political, economic and business trends in the Asia-Pacific region with a special emphasis on the APEC forum. The center also provides academic supports for the dissemination of APEC's mission and conducts "international conferences, colloquia, and outreach to the business and policy community." BASC is currently engaged in researching domestic determinants of East Asian regionalism and the effects of the rise of Russia, India and China on the U.S.-EU transatlantic alliance. Previous areas of research include Northeast Asian and Asian institutional architecture, bilateral trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific, EU transregionalism strategies, and strategies for international trade and politics in Latin America.
Staff and publications.
The center is directed by Dr. Vinod Aggarwal, an eminent international political economist. In addition to serving as directory, Aggarwal is a Professor in the Department of Political Science, an Affiliated Professor in the Business and Public Policy group in the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and Co-Chair of the U.S. Consortium of APEC Study Centers. Its project directors include Kristi Govella, Sara A. Newland, and Chloe Thurston.
Research affiliates include Professor Cédric Dupont of the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland; Professor Seung Joo Lee at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, Korea; Assistant Professor Min Gyo Koo at Seoul's Yonsei university, Professor John Ravenhill at Australian National University, and Professor Shujiro Urata at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.
Members of the center research, teach, write books, articles, blogs, and podcasts. BASC publications include a large number of books and journal articles, as well as an annual newsletter. The center's newsletter is available for download on its website. The center hosts a research blog that publishes commentaries by its staff and research affiliates. The center also has affiliates and alumni who participate in BASC projects each year.

Seaside Park is the traditional name of an event venue located at 10 West Harbor Boulevard in Ventura, California. This is the home of the Ventura County Fair. The beach front site is just downcoast of the mouth of the Ventura River. E.P. and Orpha Foster envisioned a miniature Golden Gate Park as John McLaren, the designer of that park was a family friend. They donated the original 65 acres to the County of Ventura, adding another 14 acres later. They wanted a beautiful gateway to Ventura, where families could walk and picnic, play tennis and enjoy family outings. 
The site is now owned by the State of California and is managed by 31st District Agricultural Association, a state special-purpose district in the Division of Fairs and Expositions of the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The Fair Board’s role is to set and approve policies for the organization. Members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the governor of California. They organize the annual Ventura County Fair, and run The Derby Club, the satellite horse racing facility.
Babe Ruth Field at this site served as the home of the Ventura Braves, Ventura Yankees and Ventura Oilers professional baseball teams. Although the original race track and grandstand are long gone, the Ventura Raceway is hosted at the fairground when the fair is not in season. Trade shows, concerts and other events are held throughout the year.

Association of British Muslims

The Association of British Muslims (ABM or AOBM) is an organisation of British Muslims. It claims to be the oldest such organisation, created in 1889 by Abdullah Quilliam.
History.
The Association of British Muslims claims to be the oldest organisation of British Muslims. According to the AOBM, it was first created in Liverpool, England, in 1889, as the "English Islamic Association", by Abdullah Quilliam, a 19th-century convert to Islam who founded one of England's first mosques in the same year, at about the same time that the Shah Jahan Mosque was built. The AOBM says that its name changed to the "British Muslim Society" in 1914 and to the "Western Islamic Association" in 1924. It declined in the late 1940s, was opposed by nationality-based organisations of British Muslims in 1969, and became the "Association of British Muslims" in 1975. The name "Association for British Muslims" has also been used since 1978.
Leadership.
, Daoud Rosser-Owen was caretaker Amir of AOBM. , Paul Salahuddin Armstrong was co-director of AOBM.
Public statements.
Minority rights.
In late 2010, the United Nations General Assembly "Resolution on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions", which previously opposed executions for several types of discrimination, including sexual orientation, was changed by the General Assembly to no longer exclude sexual-orientation based executions. AOBM criticised the change, stating, "Removing this clause at this time will send quite the wrong signal to those regimes that indulge in these barbaric practices, implying as it does that United Nations is no longer concerned at the maltreatment of people because of their sexual orientation or considers it to be a lesser matter." The Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association supported the AOBM's statement.
In February 2011, AOBM criticised homophobic stickers that appeared in East London. Co-director Paul Salahuddin Armstrong stated, "There is nothing in the Qur'an against LGBT people. Allah has honoured every son/daughter of Adam, so such a hateful message is not only morally and ethically wrong but actually unislamic."
Freedom of speech.
In February 2012, AOBM called for King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to drop charges of blasphemy laid against Hamza Kashgari for three tweets that he published, stating "Thought crime is no crime at all, ... Any state enforced penalty for perceived blasphemy runs contrary to the true spirit of Islam, and of our Prophet, peace be upon him, who was compassionate even to those who scorned him. ... No one should be legally prosecuted, imprisoned or detained for simply expressing themselves."

Sor Ye Ye

Sor Ye Ye is a 1967 musical film. The movie is a co-production between Spain and Mexico, starring Hilda Aguirre, Manuel Gil and Enrique Guzmán. The movie is loosely based on the novel "La hermana San Sulpicio".
Plot.
María (Hilda Aguirre) is a young orfant woman who lives with her wealthy aunt (Margot Cottens). María uses to sing in a night club along with her friends (who have a rock band named "Los Yakis Voladores"), and enjoys the night with them. One of her friends, Ernesto (Enrique Guzmán), is in love with her, although she doesn't seem to share the same feelings towards him. In fact, her multiple existential questions and a strange emptyness she feels in her life make her suddenly decide entering in a convent as a novice, breaking Ernesto's heart. However, with her happy, open and rebel nature, she doesn't seem to accustom herself to the life at the convent, and she has bigger problems with the novice headmistress, who uses to chastise her trying to lead her in the right direction. At the convent, which also works as a hospital for children, she meets a doctor (Manuel Gil) and she doesn't along with him because of the contrast between their personalities, although they have a mutual liking and respect in their own way. 
Meanwhile, the convent is going through finantial difficulties, and the nuns barely have enough to feed the children, so they are forced to suffer hunger themselves. María fixes the situation getting a "voluntary" donation from her aunt to supply the convent with food. Her aunt flew into a rage and demanded her to look for money elsewhere. And they desperately need money, first to operate a blind child, and then to prevent the closure of the convent itself. María decides, after asking permission from mother superior and the bishop, to go as a singer to the Sanremo Music Festival trying to win the first prize and the money to save the convent forever. However, she will have to compete there with Ernesto, who also wants to win the competition, and meanwhile, it seems that the doctor's feelings towards her are getting stronger, and María has increasing doubts about her religious vocation...
Controversy.
At the time of release, Hilda Aguirre was introduced as the main and only star of the film and as the song performer. Soon, that was proven to be false, because the singing voice was performed by a then unknown Estela Núñez, who at the time was forbidden to reveal she was the singer, and she was also forbidden to sing the songs in public. However, a couple of years later, Estela Núñez rose to stardom in Mexico, and later Enrique Guzmán revealed in an interview that Estela Núñez was the real singer of the film.

Niterói (magazine)

Niterói: Revista Brasileira (Portuguese for Niterói: Brazilian Magazine) was a magazine created in 1836 by three of the most proeminent Brazilian writers at the time: Gonçalves de Magalhães, Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre and Francisco de Sales Torres Homem. It was edited in Paris, France.
The magazine only lasted two issues before it became defunct.
Historical.
During the Regency period (1831–1840) of Brazil, the country saw a boom on the publication of periodicals. Due to the historical circumstances of the consolidation of institutions, the politics and the own national territory, most of the periodicals at the time had political themes. "Niterói", however, was an exception, since it discursed on sciences, arts and literature. It is now considered to be a forerunner of the Romantic movement in Brazil.
Editions.
The magazine discussed innumerous themes, from comets to the slavist economy of Brazil. In the first issue, Gonçalves de Magalhães published a manifesto named "Discurso Sobre a História da Literatura no Brasil", in which he exposed to the Brazilian nation the ideals of the then-new Romantic movement.
"Niterói"s initial print run was very limited, and the magazine's activity ceased down after Gonçalves de Magalhães was fired from his post at the Brazilian legation in France and had to return to Brazil due to divergences with its chief, Luís Moutinho.

Re Brumark Investments Ltd

Re Brumark Investments Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/28.html UKPC 28 is a New Zealand and UK insolvency law case, concerning the taking of a security interest over a company's assets and priority of creditors in a company winding up.
Facts.
Brumark Investments Ltd gave security over debts to its bank, Westpac. The terms were that its security was a fixed charge, but a floating charge when proceeds were collected (the same as drafted as in "Re New Bullas Trading Ltd"). Brumark was free to collect debts for its own account and to use proceeds in its business. Brumark went into receivership. The receivers collected the outstanding debts.
Fisher J held that uncollected debts were subject to a fixed charge, as the parties had agreed. So they were not subject to claims of preferential creditors. The NZ Court of Appeal overturned this and held that the fact Brumark could collect the debts for its own account (and hence remove them from the bank's security) made it a floating charge. So the preferential creditors had a prior claim.
Advice.
The Privy Council advised that it was indeed a floating charge. It said the court's task is not to ask whether the parties intended to create a fixed or floating charge, but to ask what rights the parties intended to create, and then decide as a matter of law whether it is fixed or floating. Lord Millett held that Nourse LJ's approach in "New Bullas" based on freedom of contract was 'fundamentally mistaken'. The process of construction required assessing what was intended, but this meant looking at the substance of the transaction, not its form. He noted that in "Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd" and "In re Keenan Bros Ltd" the proceeds of the book debts were not at the free disposal of the company - that is why these were fixed charges - the proceeds were not available to the company as a source of its cash flow.

Women's Library and Information Centre Foundation

The Women's Library and Information Centre Foundation (WLICF) is the first and only women’s library in Turkey. It was founded in Istanbul in 1989 and opened on April 14, 1990, mainly to assist research on the history of women. The library has assigned itself the mission of acquiring, protecting, and preserving the women-centred intellectual capital in Turkey with an emphasis on improving accessibility of information. 
The Foundation's Mission.
The Women's Library and Information Centre Foundation was founded in order to compile accurate and comprehensive information about the history of women in Turkey. The Foundation Bill states the library's purpose: "to gather knowledge about the history of women, to present this information in an organized way to those who do research today and to preserve the written documents of today for future generations." The Information Centre was founded by Professor Jale Baysal, Associate Professor Füsun Akatlı, Aslı Davaz, Füsun Yaraş, and Associate Professor Şirin Tekeli.
Preserving Women's History in Turkey.
In Turkey women have had limited access to education, public expression, and publications. This problem makes documenting women's history a source of empowerment for women. Information centres, archives, and libraries all over the world now document women's lives and contributions to facilitate research in women's studies.
Collections and archives.
The library has over 11,800 books , either written by women or on topics of interest to women. Reference information about these books is available in a computerized system.
The periodicals section consists of forty complete sets of titles of Ottoman and early Turkish Republic periodicals published between 1867 and 1928, 210 titles of women's periodicals published since 1928 and written with the new Turkish alphabet, and over 120 foreign language women's periodicals.
Two hundred and thirty boxes containing statutes of women's organizations, panel discussion texts, unpublished theses, miscellaneous information related to women, and statistics are classified under various topics. The ephemera section also preserves 631 doctoral and master dissertations.
The newspaper clippings collection contains articles, interviews, and tens of thousands of clippings from the majority of daily Turkish newspapers and periodicals published since 1990. There are over 280 boxes of material pertaining to women's activities and studies in Turkey and the rest of the world.
Activities organized by or held in the Library since its opening have been photographed and filmed. Information and documents about women from Ottoman times to the present are included in the visual archive classified by subject. This collection contains approximately 1,000 slides, 250 photographs, postcards, fifteen video tapes, ninety seven audio tapes and approximately 650 local and foreign posters. 
The Women Artists' Collection documents the works of past and living female artists in the fields of painting, sculpture, photography, marbling, engraving, illustration, graphic arts, and cartoon. Documents belonging to 842 artists are classified in this section, including slides of the work of eighteen artists. Artist files contain curriculum vitae, publications about the artist, the artist's own printed material (catalogs, invitations to exhibitions, posters and similar printed material), and photos. Artists with material in this collection include Hale Asaf, Tomur Atagök, Hale Tenger, Lütfiye Batukan, Aliye Berger, Zerrin Bölükbaşı, Nevin Çokay, Hamiye Çolakoğlu, Alev Ebuzziya, Neşe Erdok, Ramize Erer, Seniye Fenmen, Ayfer Karamani, Füreya Koral and Şükriye Işık.
The collection is made up of 2000 files on 951 female writers, including Asiye Hatun, Leyla Hanım, Şazi Şaziye, Şeref Hanım, Nigar Hanım, Yaşar Nezihe Hanım, and Fatma Aliye Topuz. There are thirty files pertaining to Halide Edip Adıvar, twenty-seven files pertaining to Erendiz Atasü, and forty-nine files about Adalet Ağaoğlu in the collection. These files are classified separately for the pre-Republican and the Republican periods. The files contain interviews with the writers, information on their work, newspaper and magazine articles, criticism, and promotional writing.
Over 1000 articles written in the field of women's studies in Turkish, English, French and German are available to researchers. Related entries may be found in a computer-aided retrieval system.
The nucleus of the material in this section was formed by the transcription of audio and video recordings of discussions held during the pilot project of Women's Oral History. These discussions were supported by the Turkish government's General Directorate of Women's Status and Problems. The collection contains audio cassettes of interviews and transcriptions made in 1994 by fourteen women born before 1923, photos taken during these interviews and video recordings of four of these women. Still in its early stages, this section is currently conducting interviews with the surviving first graduates of the Erenköy Girls Lycee in Istanbul, as well as professional women who have made important contributions to their respective fields.
Personal documents and records of women's organizations are preserved as a special collection and are open to researchers subject to the terms stated by the donors of the records. This collection contains more than 900 boxes of documents. Categorization of these documents is an ongoing process. The library and the archives are a reference institution and has no lending arrangement. The Foundation has published thirty six books related to its collections (bibliographies, catalogues, agendas, transcription of Ottoman women’s periodicals) and has organized more than 535 cultural activities in the form of seminars, symposiums, exhibitions, and conferences.

Freddie Brooks (sportsman)

Frederick George "Freddie" Brooks, OBE (1 May 1883 – 5 September 1947) was a Rhodesian sportsman who represented his country as both a cricketer and rugby union player. He also played a Test match for the England national rugby union team.
Brooks, although born in India, was educated at Bedford School in England. As well as captaining their cricket team and playing rugby, Brooks was also outstanding in athletics, becoming Public Schools champion in the 100-yard sprint, 110-yard hurdles, long jump and high jump. From 1900 to 1902, he played cricket for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship.
At the age of 19, Brooks was offered a civil service job in Rhodesia by William Henry Milton, the Administrator of the British colony. He had found out about the sporting abilities of Brooks by his two sons, rugby players Cecil and Jumbo, who were also students at Bedford School.
After immigrating to Salisbury, he impressed enough in his first season of club cricket that he earned the praise of former South African Test captain and Rhodesian resident H. H. Castens, who believed that Brooks "was good enough to play for South Africa". Brooks also won a Rhodesian tennis title and became the national record holder in high jump.
He took part in Rhodesia's inaugural first-class match, in 1905, against Transvaal in the Currie Cup cricket competition. Batting at three, Brooks top scored in the first innings with 61 of his team's 115 runs. In the second innings he opened the batting but made just one before being bowled by Richard Norden, who claimed 12 wickets for the match.
In 1906 he represented the Rhodesian rugby team in South Africa's Currie Cup as a wing three-quarter. He was considered unlucky to miss selection in the Springbok team to tour England in 1906/07 as he didn't meet the five-year residential qualification period, albeit by only a few months. Springbok vice-captain Paddy Carolin had wanted Brooks in the team and told him to come with them to England, at which time he would sent a telegram to the Rugby Board seeking permission to call up Brooks as a replacement player.
While in England, Brooks again played rugby for Bedford and was selected in the South vs North fixture, which was used as a trial for spots in the national team. He scored four tries and despite coming to the country to play for the Springboks, Brooks was named in the England team for a Test against the South Africans.
The match, which was played at Crystal Palace, finished in a three all draw, with Brooks scoring England's only points though a second half try.
He got further opportunities to play for England, against both France and England, but turned them down to get married back in Rhodesia.
When HDG Leveson-Gower's XI toured Rhodesia in the 1909/10 cricket season, Brooks was picked to make his second and final first-class appearance. After managing just 10 in his first innings, Brooks was again promoted from three to open the batting in the second innings and made 51.
His career in the civil service would see him made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, having served as Master of the High Court and Chairman of the Public Service.

Parroquia Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, Santiago

Parroquia Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, Santiago is Catholic parish in Santiago, Chile dedicated to Our Lady of Andacollo. The parish shares the same city block with Colegio de Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, a school administered, like the parish, by the Congregation of Holy Cross. Holy Cross Sisters serve in the parish as well.
"Our Lady of Andacollo" (), also known as the "Virgin of Andacollo" (), is a celebrated Catholic image of the Virgin Mary.
History.
In 1865, Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Andacollo was born as a chapel in honor of St. Vincent Ferrer to serve the people living to the west of the old downtown of Santiago, Chile. In 1890, a chaplain, Rev. Hernan Domeyko was assigned to the chapel. In 1901, the Archdiocese of Santiago gave permission for the construction of a church on the site of the old chapel. On Christmas Eve of 1902, the parishioners requested the construction of a church in honor of St. Vicent Ferrer and a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Andacollo. Rev. Malcolm Johnson, C.S.C. reported in 1987 that, in spite of extensive archival research, he could not uncover the reason for the change, but, from 1903 forward, the community would be referred to as the "Sanctuary of Our Lady of Andacollo."
By 1912, the Sanctuary had grown in importance to the neighborhood that it was necessary to give it the designation of parish with Rev. Ladislao Godoy as its first pastor. By 1917, the parish census had grown to between 25,000 and 30,000 parishioners over a span of 100 city blocks.
In 1943, Nicomedes Guzmán wrote his novel about the poverty of the neighborhood, ""La sangre y la esperanza"" Blood and the Hope, that frequently marks the presence of the parish in the life of the poor by the sound of the church's bells in key moments of the novel.
Formation of a Saint.
In 1913, the parish school had 180 students. That year, a night school was opened in addition to the day school, given that so many students worked during the day. During this same period, a student from a prestigious Jesuit school, San Ignacio, volunteered at the parish and school. That student worked in the office, as librarian, and as banker for the parish's students and its worker center. This student later enrolled in law school, focus on labor law, before entering the seminary with the Jesuits. Today, he is known as St. Alberto Hurtado. St. Alberto Hurtado was a champion of youth and the poor. His ministry with both began at Andacollo.
Service to the Poor.
From its inception, the parish served a large community of low-income persons. The needs always were greater than the resources. The parish responded creatively to remedy the massive needs. In 1906, a workers center was created. In 1911, the "Unión Protectora de Andacollo," a mutual benefit society or friendly society was formed. In 1915, the parish formed a conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.
Later, the parish was the seat of Catholic Action in Chile, a movement to bring Catholic social teaching into the public square.
On-going Service to the Poor.
Today, this tradition of service continues at Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Andacollo. The parish serves long-time residents of the neighborhood as well as a growing immigrant population from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. The parish has a dedicated meeting space for Alcoholics Anonymous. The parish has a thrift store as well as a soup kitchen for the elderly of the neighborhood. 
In 2011, FundaMor began a project attending to neighborhood children. FundaMor, the Congregation of Holy Cross' foundation that supervises homes for children in Chile, launched a "prevention" project in the parish. At no cost to the families, children from families with difficulties meet with a psychologist, a school psychologist, and a social worker to resolve family problems before the child would need to be removed from the home. Currently, the project attends to fifty children and has a waiting list.
Earthquakes.
The 1985 Santiago earthquake provoked extensive damage to the church. It struck, in fact, during mass, and, while all escaped the church safely, the church tower fell. Nine months after the earthquake, on December 3, 1985, restoration work commenced. Almost a year to the day later, on December 6, 1986, the church was rededicated in a celebration of the Eucharist, presided over by Cardinal Juan Francisco Fresno, then Archbishop of Santiago. In 1987, the parish set about restoring the office, meetings rooms, and soup kitchen. 
The 2010 Chile earthquake also rendered extensive damage to the church. For several weeks, the parish worshiped outdoors. Eventually, sufficient funds were raised to repair the interior of the church. The parish soup kitchen remains, needing significant structural reinforcement.
Vocations.
In addition to contributing to the formation of St. Alberto Hurtado, Archbishop Antonio Moreno Casamitjana, emeritus Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Concepción is a native son of the parish.

Teesside Wind Farm

Construction of the windfarm began in Feb. 2011 and was complete by June 2013. The wind farm was developed by EDF Energy (Northern Offshore Wind) Ltd., and is operated by Teesside Windfarm Ltd.; the owner (100%) is EDF Energy Renewables.
History and design.
In 2004 EDF was awarded a 20-year lease from The Crown Estate to develop a wind farm at Teesside during the first phase of UK offshore wind farm development. (See also Round 1 wind farm.) The wind farm site was located 1.5km offshore of Coatham Sands, Redcar in Cleveland, UK on a site; initial plans were to intall 3 rows of 10 turbines of rating 2.3-3.6 MW, with electrical power supplied to shore with landfall at South Gare / Coatham Sands with a land substation and control room at Warrenby; connection to the existing electrical grid was to be made to Northern Electric Distribution (NEDL)'s (see Northern Electric) electricity network at Lackenby
The windfarm was planned to operate at windspeeds between (start to full power), with automatic cut off at wind speeds over .
The wind farm received planning consent in Nov. 2007; a challenger of the consent decision led to a judicial review, which allowed the project to proceed in 2008; the project was further delayed by diffuclty obtaining financing for the project. The offshore substation received planning consent in Nov. 2008. and an agreement on connection to the NEDL grid was reached in Nov. 2009.
Construction of a 27 turbine wind farm using 2.3MW turbines began in Feb 2011, with commisioning initially expected for 2012. Turbine foundations were to be up to 5.5m diameter monopiles either drilled and/or piled upto a depth of 35m. Inter turbine electrical connections and the connection to shore were to be energised at 33kV.
The first turbine was installed by Jan. 2013, delayed by half a year from the original expected installation date; by April 2013 17 turbines had been installed with three turbines operational and connected to and supplying power into the UK electricity grid. Installation of the 27 turbines was complete by June 2013. The wind farm was officially opened in April 2014.
At the end of the 22 year Crown Estate lease the wind farm is expected to be decomissioned by the developer.

British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France

British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Cie Nationale Air France 1 WLR 758 is a UK insolvency law case, concerning priority of creditors in a company winding up.
Facts.
A number of airlines agreed to set up a clearing house to manage debt and credit accounts among themselves. Each airline in the group owed multiple and changing debts to one another, so to make settlements easier, participants were not meant to claim against one another, but simply enter their transactions in the clearing house, and then settle the balance at the end of each month. The clearing house fell under the authority of the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. British Eagle went insolvent, and owed money to the clearing house overall, but was a creditor to Air France. The liquidator attempted to recover the money from Air France and Air France argued it was bound by the clearing house scheme, and could only collect money after netting out the claims of creditors of British Eagle in IATA. So the liquidator challenged the legality of the scheme, as it purported to sidestep "pari passu".
Judgment.
The majority of the House of Lords (Lord Cross, Lord Diplock and Lord Edmund-Davies) held that the clearing house scheme could not put Air France in a better position than it would be, and could not have the effect of avoiding the insolvency priority rules, which would be against public policy. It was unlawful to attempt to contract out of (what is now) the Insolvency Act 1986 section 107. Therefore the majority in the House of Lords ruled in favour of the liquidators of British Eagle. 
Lord Cross of Chelsea gave the leading opinion.
Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest and Lord Simon of Glaisdale gave dissenting judgments.

<doc id="31029803" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31029803" title="Silent preaching">
Silent preaching

Silent preaching also called muta predicatio in Latin or muta predicazione in Italian is a term used in Catholic Art to describe the use of religious images as a method of conveying devotional messages, teachings and religious concepts, beginning around the Renaissance in Italy.
The "Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images" (also simply called his "Discorso") written by Gabriele Paleotti, the 16th century Archbishop of Bologna is also known as the "Catechism of images" for it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination, following the Council of Trent in which he was a participant. Paleotti's approach was much more artistic than the approach proposed by his contemporary and Trent participant Charles Borromeo in his "Instructions on Ecclesiastical Buildings" but Borromeo (who had considerable power) approved of Paleotti's methods and implemented them. While Borromeo's "Instructions" did include a chapter called "On Sacred Images and Pictures", his focus was mostly on architectural and design elements, rather than art. However, Paleotti's focus was "the transformation of Christian life through vision". 
Paleotti had great respect for his contemporary Filippo Neri and his style of oration and considered the use of "ordinary language" for preaching ("sermo humilis") as essential for reaching the masses. Paleotti also argued that dogmatic teachings, however precise, could not reach the heart of the public as easily as the visual arts and hence could not produce real change in the Church unless accompanied by art. Paleotti believed in the "nonverbal rules of language" that are deeply rooted in the human spirit and considered religious art as the key to the communication of devotions as well as doctrines. 
The use of religious "picture text" was growing in Europe within the same period and
Rosary meditation using "narrative images" gained so much popularity that at the end of the 16th century the most widely used rosary meditation in Germany was not a written one, but a picture text.
The use of "muta predicatio" continued well into the Baroque period where paintings came to be seen as imagistic writing and a form of visual language for instruction. Visual art thus came to act as the "literature of the layman" via the concept of "pictura-litteratura illiterata", i.e. pictures are the literature of the illiterate.
Art historian Pamela J. Huckins has argued that the Franciscan missions of Alta California into the 19th century also employed "muta predicatio" to use art to transcend the barriers of language and literacy. She suggests that specific images were employed in this period to instruct indigenous mission congregations about Christianity, as well as European culture, and to help the audience recall and relate to what was said during specific sermons.

Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd

Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd 1 WLR 676 is a UK insolvency law case, concerning a quasi-security interest in a company's assets and priority of creditors in a company winding up.
Facts.
Aluminium Industrie Vaasen BV was a Dutch supplier of aluminium foil. Romalpa Aluminium Ltd processed it in their factory. In the contract of sale, it said that ownership of the foil would only be transferred to Romalpa when the purchase price had been paid in full and products made from the foil should be kept by the buyers as bailees (the contract referring to the Dutch expression ‘fiduciary owners’) separately from other stock on AIV’s behalf as ‘surety’ for the rest of the price. But it also said Romalpa had the power to sell the manufactured articles in the course of business. When such sales took place, this would be deemed to be as an agent for AIV. Romalpa went insolvent, and the receiver and manager of Romalpa's bank, Hume Corporation Ltd, wanted the aluminium to be caught by its floating charge. AlV contended that its contract was effective to retain title to the goods, and so it did not need to share them with other creditors in the liquidation.
Judgment.
High Court.
Mocatta J held the retention of title clause was effective. Aluminium Industrie Vaasen was still the owner of the aluminium foil, and could trace the price due to them into the proceeds of sale of the finished goods, ahead of Romalpa’s unsecured and secured creditors. He said the following.
Court of Appeal.
Roskill LJ, Goff LJ and Megaw LJ upheld the decision, and that Aluminium Industrie Vaassen retained title to the unused aluminium foil.

The Chieftains in China

The Chieftains in China is an album released by the Irish musical group The Chieftains in 1985. In 1983 the Chieftains were the first Irish musicians to visit China and the first ever Western musical group to play on the Great Wall of China. The album was the end result of this trip and was recorded in China and Hong Kong by Brian Masterson of Windmill Lane Studios.
Background.
In 1980, diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in London attended Royal Albert Hall for "The Sense of Ireland" festival, where the Chieftains were performing. The diplomats had enjoyed the performance so much that they invited the band to visit China on a musical tour. As China had no embassy in Ireland at the time this was problematic.
When full diplomatic relations between Ireland and China were established in 1981, Moloney planned the trip with Chinese ambassadors and sent copies of Irish music to various Chinese orchestras. The Chieftains were one of the first groups from the West to visit China and became the first ever Western group to play on the Great Wall of China. While in China the group performed with various Chinese folk orchestras, as well as more impromptu performances with local musicians.
"The Chieftains in China" is a compilation of the songs played while the Chieftains visited China. It was released two years after the tour.
Legacy.
The final concert The Chieftains performed was filmed by Chinese television and broadcast to 700 million people. Leading Chinese politicians attended the performance and chieftains biographer John Glatt wrote that the tour cemented diplomatic relations between Ireland and China.
Sun Sheng, the vice chairman of the Musician's Association of China said of the visit,"I think through The Chieftains' music I have seen the images of the Irish people. Music knows no boundaries for it is a unique and comprehensive language."
The Chieftains returned to Ireland with a large collection of Chinese instruments that they planned to learn and incorporate into their music. Moloney told RTE Radio that he planned to use some of the Chinese music in film scores that he was composing.

Gilbert Davey (7 June 1913 – 6 April 2011) was a writer and radio enthusiast who introduced many youngsters to the rapidly developing fields of Radio and Electronics through his articles published in "Boy's Own Paper", and his books, in particular "Fun with Radio", first published in 1957, with updates ending in a sixth edition published in 1978. He also presented, beginning in September 1957, a six-part series on the BBC Television children's magazine programme called "Studio 'E'".
Though an amateur in the field (his real job was as an insurance official), Davey inspired many British youngsters to go on to make careers in the field of Radio and Electronics, by concentrating on a practical approach to building a progression of radio receivers, starting with a Crystal Set and moving through 'One valve', 'Two valve' and 'Five valve Superhet' designs. Many of the titles sound quaint today, but reflect the excitement that many felt about radio at a time when, despite the fact that broadcasting in Britain had existed for some thirty-five years, manufactured sets were still expensive acquisitions. In 1957 the Walkman, or iPod was an unimaginable dream; so that a 'Portable Cycle Radio' was a high status object of desire indeed for many a boy. In his introduction to 'Fun with Radio', Davey referred to Electronics as "a new modern industry which has rapidly assumed a position of importance in the industrial life of the world".
His designs used a variety of pre-war and post-war valve types such as the 1.4V DAF91, DL94 series, or the 2V HL2K, PM2HL, PM22A series, and generally required two batteries, one of which was a 90V 'HT' battery (an expensive item to be used sparingly). A mains two valve design used the war-surplus, metal-can enclosed, EF50 valves.
When transistors first became available to amateurs in the mid-1950s, Davey was initially cautious, believing that their initial high price and variable performance made them an expensive risk for young constructors. However he soon relaxed these reservations, and his first transistor radio design appeared in Boy's Own Paper in January 1957. The title "Make a Cold Valve Set" summed up the novelty of the transistor.
Davey's subsequent articles and books covered almost every aspect of radio, shortwave listening, high fidelity and electronics for the amateur. Transistor designs came to predominate, and Davey kept up with new developments such as modular construction and integrated circuits. However he never entirely forsook valves (vacuum tubes), recognizing their usefulness as an introduction to basic principles and their continued availability in many parts of the world.
Davey always kept in mind the problems faced by young hobbyists: lack of skill, tools and test gear, and availability of components. Some designs were revised several times over the years for the latter reason.
Davey's last book, Fun with Silicon Chips in Modern Radio, was published in 1981.

Inuit Sign Language

Inuit Sign Language (ISL, or IUR for "Inuit Uukturausingit"), also known as Eskimo Sign Language and Inuktitut Sign Language, is the indigenous sign language used by Inuit communities in the eastern Arctic, including Nunavut and perhaps northern Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Greenland. 
At least since the 18th century, hearing Inuit used some form of sign language for trade and communication between various Inuit languages, a similar role to that played by Plains Sign Language further south. This may have been IUR or at least its ancestor, as the region has a high incidence of congenital deafness. In the territory of Nunavut, for example, the incidence of hereditary deafness is six times that of southern Canada. The deaf are well integrated in the community, and there are perhaps two hearing people proficient in IUR for every deaf speaker, as in other communities with high rates of congenital deafness such as Martha's Vineyard. However, IUR is not (or no longer) used as a contact language among the hearing. Its speakers are the deaf and those hearing people they regularly communicate with; there are perhaps two hearing speakers for every deaf speaker of IUR. 
IUR is a threatened language. Those deaf who have been to school use American Sign Language; only about a third of the population (50 people ca. 2000) use IUR as their native language. The sign language of Greenland is reported to be "closely related", though with some ASL and Danish Sign Language loans. It is not clear how far west IUR extends.
Greenlandic Sign Language is known as "Kalaallisut Ussersuutit" in Inuit. Inuktitut Sign Language is "Inuktitut Uukturausiq, Inuktitut Tikuqqat," or "Tikurarniq Inuktitut". The formal name for the umbrella language is "Inuit Uqausiqatigiit Uukturausiq Uqajuittunut" "General Inuit Sign Language for Deaf".

Nelson Pit

Nelson Pit was a coal mine operating on the Manchester Coalfield from the 1830s or 1840s in Shakerley, Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, then in the historic county of Lancashire, England.
Originally named Shakerley Colliery, the pit was sunk on land leased from Ellis Fletcher and worked by Nathan Eckersley in 1851. In 1861 the colliery passed to William Ramsden who owned Messhing Trees Colliery half a mile to the south. A shaft was sunk to 840 feet and the pit produced house coal from the Trencherbone mine. The colliery was renamed after 1880. The shaft was deepened to the Arley mine at 1486 feet. Nelson Pit closed in 1938. Shakerley Colliery and Messhing Trees were owned by William Ramsden's Shakerley Collieries.
The colliery was isolated from the main roads and railway and access to it was via a toll road, Shakerley Lane, connecting it to the Bolton to Leigh turnpike which continued to charge tolls until 1948. After the opening of the Tyldesley Loopline in 1864, William Ramsden built a mineral railway to link his collieries to the main line east of the Tyldesley Coal Company's sidings. 
The colliery was the scene of a disaster on 2 October 1883; six men died when the cage rope broke.
The colliery was sold to Manchester Collieries in 1935 and abandoned in October 1938.

Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)

Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8) AC 214 is a UK insolvency law case, concerning the taking of a security interest over a company's assets and priority of creditors in a company winding up.
Facts.
BCCI made loans to a number of companies and had in its contract purported to take as security, in return for the loans, a charge over the money in the bank accounts these companies held with BCCI. In an earlier case, "In re Charge Card Services Ltd" Millett J had said it was "conceptually impossible" for a bank to have a charge over assets that were held in an account of its own, on the basis that a bank account is an intangible debt recorded in figures in the bank's own books, and a bank's debt to its customer was not something that the customer could 'own' and charge out. The liquidators of BCCI applied for directions about whether, when they were recovering loans from the main debtor companies they should set off the amounts in credit in the deposit accounts under the Insolvency Rules 1986 rule 4.90.
The High Court held that since the security agreements did not impose personal liability on the third parties for the loans, the companies had no right to set-off under rule 4.90. In the Court of Appeal Millet LJ gave the leading judgment and said ‘a man cannot have a proprietary interest in a debt or other obligation which he owes another.’ The charges were conceptually impossible. Yet they were nevertheless good security by reason of the contractual provision limiting the right to repayment and that there were no grounds for holding that they were ineffective unless construed as imposing personal liability.
Judgment.
Lord Hoffmann held that the charges were valid and not conceptually impossible. He referred to the general attributes of charges and went on. He said the right to claim payment of a deposit with a bank is a chose in action - a proprietary right. It can be granted to a third party. So a charge could be created over a deposit in favour of BCCI. He said as follows.

Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities

The Sinchon Museum of United States War Atrocities is located in Sinchon, North Korea, and is dedicated to preserving and displaying artifacts from the Sinchon Massacre, the alleged mass murder of Communist sympathizers and North Korean civilians by the U.S. military during the Korean War.
History.
The Sinchon Museum of United States War Atrocities remembers the deaths of over 35,000 people in a series of events occurring from October 17 to November 7, 1950 when the area was occupied by the United States.
The Institute for Korean Historical Studies, summarized in a Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation report, concluded that both Communists and anti-Communist vigilantes were engaging in wholesale slaughter throughout the area, and that the 19th Infantry Regiment took the city and failed to prevent the secret police that came with them from perpetuating the civilian murders, but did not participate themselves. Furthermore, when Communists retook the city, the population was again purged. Other sources have concluded that the "massacre" was caused by a local rivalry that used the fog of war as a pretense.
The museum complex consists of several buildings, an air raid shelter, and a gravesite. The museum is housed in the former Sinchon County Party Committee building. Photographs, paintings, and artifacts are displayed in 16 rooms in the main hall and in 3 rooms in hall number two.
Alleged American war atrocities against the Korean people is a primary theme of the museum. Chronicled are the events from the General Sherman incident, Christian missionary activities, the post-World War II occupation of Korea, and the Korean War.

Cyanea procera

Cyanea procera is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name Molokai cyanea. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Molokai. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This plant has been reduced to very low numbers. At one time it was thought to be extinct. By 1992 there were four plants known. By 2005 there was only a single plant of this species existing in the wild. Plant propagation efforts have not been successful.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a tree which looks superficially like a palm. It is known from montane wet forests on Molokai, a habitat with a dense, closed canopy and a shady understory. Associated plants include "Asplenium" spp., pilo ("Coprosma ochracea"), māmaki ("Pipturus albidus"), olonā ("Touchardia latifolia"), "Sadleria" spp., ōpuhe ("Urera glabra"), "Cheirodendron" spp., "Cibotium" spp., "Machaerina" spp., pua kala ("Cyanea sonenocalyx"), ōhā wai nui ("Clermontia arborescens"), "Cyrtandra" spp., and "Diplazium" species. The habitat is threatened with degradation and destruction by a number of forces, especially feral pigs and goats. Plants are damaged by slugs, snails, rats, and birds. They face competition from exotic plant species such as castor bean ("Ricinus communis") and banana ("Musa" spp.).

USS "SC-23", until July 1920 known as USS "Submarine Chaser No. 23" or USS "S.C. 23", was an "SC-1"-class submarine chaser built for the United States Navy during World War I.
"SC-23" was a wooden-hulled 110-foot (34 m) submarine chaser built at the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York. She was commissioned on 16 October 1917 as USS "Submarine Chaser No. 23", abbreviated at the time as USS "S.C. 23".
During World War I, "S.C. 23" served in the Group of submarine chasers.
When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920, "Submarine Chaser No. 23" was classified as SC-23 and her name was shortened to USS "SC-23".
Sometime in 1920, "SC-23" was destroyed by fire.

Southcrest, San Diego

Southcrest is a community in the southeastern section of the city of San Diego. It is bordered by Mountain View on the north and east, Interstate 5 and the neighborhoods of Barrio Logan and Logan Heights on the west, and Shelltown on the south. Major thoroughfares include National Avenue and 40th Street.
History.
Prior to the 1980's the Southcrest area was part of the neighborhood Shelltown and many residents still consider this area Shelltown. The neighborhood was to have been bifurcated by a planned freeway - California State Route 252 - which would have connected Interstate 805 to Interstate 5. This freeway has been deleted, and a portion of the previous right of way has been developed into the 252 Corridor Park. Many of the older homes in this area were destroyed in anticipation of the freeway and later replaced with track housing. The area was renamed Southcrest shortly after. 
Landmarks and facilities.
A portion of Chollas Creek runs through Southcrest on its way to San Diego Bay. 252 Corridor Park parallels much of the creekbed through the neighborhood. 252 Corridor Park has been renamed Southcrest Trails Park. San Diego’s Southcrest Trails Park is located between the Southcrest and Shelltown neighborhoods within the Chollas Creek floodplain, part of the smallest watershed in San Diego and containing the highest population density. The Park itself is located south of Boston Avenue and west of South 38th Street. The park is scheduled to be completed in December 2012

NEStalgia

NEStalgia is an indie video game, for Microsoft Windows operating systems, created by Silk Games. Described by developers as "Dragon Warrior 3 meets World of Warcraft", "NEStalgia" is a modern online role-playing game made to look and play like a classic role-playing video game from the 8-bit console era. "NEStalgia" was in development for 2 years before publicly launching on February 23, 2011. In the time following the public release the game was almost completely overhauled and remade, leading to its launch on Steam on April 15, 2014.
Gameplay.
The core gameplay follows the classic JRPG format (particularly Dragon Quest) with turn-based battles, random encounters, and many towns and dungeons to explore. There are 8 character classes in total, each with its own unique moveset. The focus of "NEStalgia" is a cooperative party system in which players join up to battle monsters and complete quests together.
In addition to the classic elements, the game has more modern MMORPG trappings such as world chat, a guild system, Player versus player combat, rare items and gear to find, a quest log, and a player auction house for item trading.
Development.
Self-described "hobbyist" developers, the Silk Games team is led by Ben Mallahan (Silk) and has been creating online games using the BYOND game creation system since 2001. "NEStalgia" was in development for two years, which included an 11 month public beta period. The game was launched on February 23, 2011.
Since release, "NEStalgia" has undergone many changes as the developers worked to take the game from being a hobby project to a full-fledged indie MMO. Notable changes include improved framerate, major graphical and interface upgrades, and a "companion" system that allows solo players to recruit and fight alongside most monsters in the game. Although "NEStalgia" is still developed and powered using BYOND, it became downloadable as a standalone game in June 2012.
"NEStalgia" was submitted to Steam Greenlight in August 2012. It was Greenlit in a batch of 100 projects on August 28, 2013, then launched on Steam on April 15, 2014.

Losin' Streak (album)

"Losin' Streak" was Ray Stevens' ninth studio album and his fourth for Barnaby Records, released in 1973. The second track is a re-recording of one of Stevens' songs that was included on his second album, "This Is Ray Stevens" (1963). Cover versions include the Everly Brothers' hit "Bye Bye Love" and singer/songwriter Freddie Hart's hit "Easy Lovin'." Both the album and the title track (the album's sole single) unfortunately failed to chart.
On interesting notes, Stevens would have a hit the next year that contained the word "streak," and this song became his biggest hit. That same year of the release of "The Streak," the third track from this album, "Inside," was released along with a non-album track entitled "Everybody Needs a Rainbow" as a double A-side single.
The front and back of the album each contain one photo of Stevens playing the piano and singing into a microphone at a recording studio.

Illingworth v Houldsworth

Illingworth v Houldsworth or Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association AC 355 is a UK insolvency law case, concerning the taking of a security interest over a company's assets with a floating charge. In the Court of Appeal Romer LJ held that a key to a floating charge, as opposed to a fixed charge was that the company can carry on its business with assets subject to the charge.
Facts.
The Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd had borrowed money from various guarantors, and in a trust deed of 23 April 1900, it said it was giving a floating charge to the guarantors to secure the money. Further guarantees were given to the guarantor's bank, the Bradford District Bank Ltd, and the guarantors were pressing for repayment. With debts still outstanding, the Association organised a further deal on 25 October 1902. Mr Frederick Illingworth, on behalf of the guarantors, agreed with the Association to have a charge over the company's book debts. It called this an "indemnity and specific security", and said that being assigned were “all and singular the book and other debts now owing to the association, and also all and singular the book and other debts which may at any time during the continuance of this security become owing to the association (but not including uncalled capital of the association), and the full benefit of all the securities for the said present and future book and other debts”. On 21 November 1902, Mr Illingworth appointed a receiver to call in the book debts (a large sum, amounting to £71,000). Receivers of the other creditors were quickly appointed on 25 November, and contended that the deed from 25 October 1902 was void, because it was not registered, as floating charges were meant to be, under the Companies Act 1900 section 14(1) (now CA 2006 section 860).
Judgment.
Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal held that the charge in question was floating, and so was void because it was not registered. Vaughan Williams LJ gave the first judgment. Romer LJ said a charge is "floating" if it (1) is a charge on present and future assets (2) the class of assets changes in the ordinary course of business, and (3) the company can deal with the assets in business as usual.
House of Lords.
The House of Lords affirmed Romer LJ's decision. Earl of Halsbury LC held the following.
Lord MacNaghten agreed. 
Lord James and Lord Lindley concurred.

Fun with Radio

Fun with Radio is a book by Gilbert Davey first published in 1957 by Edmund Ward Ltd (London). At a time when radio receivers were still very expensive, and portable radios still a rarity (transistors were just being introduced), the book introduced many youngsters, mainly boys, to radio construction, and in some cases a career in radio or electronics. Radio construction was, in the early years of broadcasting, a very popular hobby among boys. By the time he published 'Fun with Radio', Davey already had a huge following among readers of Boy's Own Paper, where he was said to be the most popular contributor on practical subjects among its readers, and in that same year he presented a series on BBC Television's 'Studio 'E" which reportedly brought him 26,000 letters within a few days of the first broadcast 
Gilbert Davey had a career as an insurance official, and was an amateur in the field of radio, but his enthusiasm and straightforward writing with clear detailed diagrams inspired many youngsters.
Six editions of the book were published, the final one in 1978. Davey also wrote "Fun with Short Wave Radio", "Fun with Transistors", "Fun with Hi-Fi", and "Fun with Silicon Chips in Modern Radio" (1981).

Inverneill House

Inverneill House is a country house in Argyll, western Scotland. It stands on the west shore of Loch Fyne, around south of Lochgilphead. Although the house is not listed, the walled gardens and mausoleum on the estate are protected as category B listed buildings.
The lands of Inverneill first came into Campbell hands in 1480 when the lands of Knapdale were granted to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll. In 1773, it passed to a branch of Campbell of Craignish: Sir Archibald Campbell became the owner of the estate. Though neither the largest nor the grandest of his several estates, it was Archibald's favourite, but he was unable to live on the land as he was appointed Governor of Jamaica and then of Madras in India, dying a few months after his return. It was his elder brother, Sir James Campbell of Killean, Perthshire, who first made a home at Inverneill, using it as a summer 'cottage' for his family.
The house was of a good size in those days, having dining and drawing rooms, 8 bedrooms, a housekeeper's room, servants' rooms, pantry, kitchen and scullery, as well as outhouses containing wash house, laundry and dairy. The walled garden with its high wall containing two turrets was reputed to be one of the finest in Scotland for fruit and vegetables of all kinds.
Lt Col. Duncan Campbell, 7th of Inverneill, added the three-storey wing around 1890. The house was occupied by the Campbell family until 1955 when it was sold, though the family continue to own Inverneill Island. The last two occupants were the Misses Olive and Una Campbell. Their sister Ysobel who had married and became Mrs. Stewart of Fasnacloich was the founder of the Scottish Country Dance Society and became its first Secretary. A country dance named "Inverneill House" was composed in her honour.

Harriet Hubbard Ayer

Harriet Hubbard Ayer (June 27, 1849, Chicago, Illinois – November 25, 1903, New York City) was an American cosmetics entrepreneur and journalist during the second half of the nineteenth century.
Biography.
Harriet Hubbard Ayer was a Chicago socialite. She became famous for having initiated the first cosmetic company in the United States and for fighting to maintain her business against male predators. She set the stage for later female cosmetic moguls.
Ayer was a victim of kidnapping and also suffered from madness, but was able to reinvent herself during the last seven years of her life as the highest paid newspaper woman in the United States. She was highly regarded as the author of articles about beauty, health, and etiquette for Joseph Pulitzer’s "New York World". Her essays were compiled into a popular book in 1899 that was reissued in 1974 and more recently in an abbreviated format in 2005.
She was a proto-feminist, and her articles influenced women across the United States and abroad. While Helena Rubinstein, Elizabeth Arden, Hazel Bishop, and Estee Lauder are held in high regard as early women entrepreneurs in the cosmetics field, Harriet Hubbard Ayer was one of the first to have a successful career in the beauty industry.
Early life.
Harriet Hubbard Ayer was a Chicago socialite who, by necessity, turned away from her privileged world to achieve wealth and success in business at a time when most genteel women did not work. On October 2, 1866, at the age of seventeen, she married Herbert Copeland Ayer, a man fourteen years her senior.
After separating from Herbert at the end of 1882 she took her two daughters, Hattie and Margaret, and moved to New York City. The collapse of the Ayer iron business in 1883, compounded by her mother’s dwindling inheritance, rendered Harriet almost destitute. These circumstances provided the critical motivation for her resolve to support herself and her daughters in the style to which they were accustomed. In desperation Ayer accepted a job as a saleswoman and interior designer for antique furniture store, Sypher’s. On one of her frequent business trips to Europe seeking treasures for clients, she discovered a chemist in Paris who created creams and perfumes. Eventually, she bought from him the formula for a face cream that reputedly had been used by the famous French beauty Madame Recamier (1777–1849), and created her own product.
First career.
In 1886, she launched Recamier Toilet Preparations, Inc., which she managed and marketed by incorporating her own name on the label and writing strategic, innovative advertising copy. These actions were dually audacious, especially the use of her family name and crest on her products. People of her class were appalled at such indiscretions, but Harriet understood that it actually encouraged women who aspired to a higher social status to purchase her products. Her products included creams, balms, scents, brushes, soaps and more which brought in over one million dollars a year. She used much of her earnings for interesting advertisements, paid endorsements by famous entertainers, and for advertorials. Her advertising acuity led to her commercial success.
Scandals.
Between 1887 and 1893, at the height of her career as the head of her cosmetics company, Blanche Howard, a finishing school mistress in Stuttgart, Germany, turned Ayer's daughters, who were enrolled there, against her. Ayer was publicly accused of scandalous behavior in five lawsuits in 1889, which were broadcast weekly in the newspapers. In her attempt to regain control over her children, she was drugged and isolated and eventually institutionalized in 1893 by her former husband, encouraged by James M. Seymour, who plotted to take over her business.
Every period in Ayer's life revolved around a difficult relationship with a man. Her husband Herbert Copeland Ayer turned out to be an alcoholic philanderer; a later partner, General E. Burd Grubb, left her for a younger woman; and the man who funded her business, James Seymour, proved to be a swindler and a rake.
Ayer's mental symptoms, a combination of “Melancholia” and addiction to doctor prescribed morphine for headaches, exhaustion, and insomnia, led to her commitment as a ‘lunatic.’ It took fourteen months for her to escape from the Bronxville Insane Asylum. While recovering from her ordeal and to regain the respect of her daughters and the community, Ayer gave dramatic lectures in 1895 documenting the intolerable conditions in asylums. Her career as a journalist commenced a year later, when in 1896 she was hired by the "New York World" to write and edit their new weekly woman’s section. Her articles and her book were in the vanguard for women seeking to improve themselves during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. 
It is Harriet Hubbard Ayer who inaugurated the beauty industry and women’s acceptance of cosmetic products that would change grooming habits forever. She anticipated modern American consumer culture and the identified women as consumers for whom shopping became a leisure activity and makeup a necessity. This was the beginning of a new identity for women as consumers to whom advertisers directed their promotions
Editor of the "New York World" women's pages.
Following her success as an entrepreneur, her articles and book about women’s health and beauty were in the vanguard, tapping into feminine desires that were far more than just health and beauty, but also dreams of transformation and social advancement. Although she did not belong to the emergent feminist movements of her day, she epitomized the independent woman, played a part in the new mass journalism, and paved the way for later women entrepreneurs.
When Ayer died of pneumonia and nephritis at the age of 54 in New York, she was the highest paid female journalist in the United States and was receiving 20,000 letters a year.

National Provincial Bank v Charnley

National Provincial Bank v Charnley 1 KB 431 is a UK insolvency law case, concerning the taking of a security interest over a company's assets and priority of creditors in a company winding up.
Facts.
Two creditors of the Fylde Bacon Curing Co were in dispute over who could seize the company’s property. The National Provincial Bank had a contract on 16 July 1921 that said it had a lease ‘demised’ for 996 years over ‘plant used in or about the premises’ in return for a loan. Charnley, an unsecured creditor who had already got judgment, argued that this did not include some company vans, because the word ‘demise’ suggested things concerning land. The bank claimed the vans should belong to it, because its charge was first, and its charge was duly registered under the Companies Act 1908 section 93 (now CA 2006 s 860).
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal held, Bankes LJ and Scrutton LJ giving the first two judgments, that the substance of the documents was that a charge was to be created, and the charge had been properly registered. Atkin LJ concurred and started his judgment with an outline of what a charge was. It being a matter of the parties’ intentions, a charge had been created.

British India Steam Navigation Co v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1881) 7 QBD 165 is a case relevant for UK commercial law and UK insolvency law case, concerning the definition of a debenture.
Facts.
The British India Steam Navigation Company had undertaken on paper to pay the holder £100 on 30 November 1882 and pay interest half yearly at 5% pa. The paper said these were “debentures”. Meanwhile, the Stamp Act 1870, a taxation statute, said that “debentures” were subject to a higher rate of stamp duty. The company then tried to argue that in fact these were not debentures at all, and merely a “promissory note”. AV Dicey and Herschell QC appeared for the Revenue.
Judgment.
Lindley J held that the instruments were debentures and therefore subject to stamp duty. They were debentures because they were documents that acknowledged a debt.

Cyanea recta is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common names upright cyanea and Kealia cyanea. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Kauai. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
A 1998 survey estimated up to 1500 individuals remaining in seven populations. These are in a few locations on Kauai, including the Makaleha Mountains. By 2008 one population apparently contained "several thousand" plants.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub growing up to 1.5 meters tall. The inflorescence bears purple-striped white or solid purple flowers. It grows in wet forest habitat in the understory of "ʻōhiʻa lehua" ("Metrosideros polymorpha").
The habitat is threatened with degradation and destruction by a number of forces, especially feral pigs and exotic plant species such as fireweed ("Erechtites valerianifolia") and Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta").

<doc id="31030216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31030216" title="Jerome Xavier">
Jerome Xavier

Jerome Xavier, born Jerónimo de Ezpeleta y Goñi (1549 – June 27, 1617), was a Spanish Jesuit missionary into the Mughal court of Akbar (1542–1605), and his son Jahangir. Grand-nephew of Saint Francis Xavier he chose to be called "Jerome Xavier".
Early life.
Jerome Xavier was born "in the castle of his father Miguel de Ezpeleta" in the northern province of Navarra, Spain in 1549. Xavier's great-uncle, Saint Francis Xavier, was a closer friend of Ignatius of Loyola, and co-founder of the Society of Jesus. 
On May 7, 1568 at the age of nineteen Jerome entered the Society of Jesus upon completion of a degree of Bachelor of Philosophy from the University of Alcalá. He spent the following years studying theology and philosophy before being ordained priest in 1575. Upon his ordination Xavier spent a number of years teaching "elementary subjects" in Villarejo de Fuentes in Cuenca, (central Spain), before being sent east, arriving in Goa in September, 1581.
Missionary work.
First years.
Upon arrival at the Portuguese Goa Father Jerome was "appointed as master of novices" but quickly had to relinquish the position due to illness "as a consequence of the difficult sea-voyage and the troubles of acclimatization". Following his recovery Xavier began work on a Portuguese translation of Father Alessandro Valignano's "History of the Jesuits in India". 
In early 1584 Xavier was installed as the Rector of the Bassein College, though poor health hampered his duty once again and forced him to be transferred to the "more favorable climate" of Cochin where he occupied the same position from 1586 to 1592. Around this time Father Xavier was appointed as the Superior of the Professed House of Goa, though election to his new position further strained tense relations between the Portuguese and Spanish in the Oriental colony. The tension of a Castillian ruling a Portuguese population was eased when Mughal Emperor Akbar, (1542–1605), called for the third mission of Jesuit priests to his court and Father Jerome was sent, by popular election, to Lahore where he arrived on May 5, 1595.
In the court of Akbar.
Father Jerome's arrival in Lahore was marked by the hospitality of Akbar who provided Xavier and his two companions, Father Emmanuel Pinheiro and Brother Bento de Góis, with lodgings in his own palace and "assigned a Muslim doctor to instruct them" in learning the Persian language". 
During the reign of Akbar, Father Jerome accompanied the Emperor on various expeditions through the Deccan Plateau witnessing the capture of the fortress as Asirgarh in January 1601. 
During the conquest Akbar moved his permanent residence to Agra providing stability that allowed Father Jerome to "devote much of his time to the creation of a Christian religious literature written in the Persian tongue". 
It was approximately during this time that more Jesuit missionaries began to arrive to replace Father Emmanuel and Brother Bento who had been sent to explore on the central route leading to China (the search of Cathay) and that the greatest accomplishment of Father Jerome and the Jesuits under Emperor Akbar was achieved. 
While Xavier was accompanying the army and his two original companions sent elsewhere he was notified by Father Francesco Corsi, (1573–1635), of the declining atmosphere of religious freedom in Lahore under the "intolerant attitude of the Viceroy" put in place by Akbar. Immediately Father Jerome requested that the Emperor send the more experienced Father Pinheiro back to Lahore as was as issuing a farmān "granting freedom of worship" to the Christians. This is significant largely because Akbar had denied previous requests by the missionaries to "strengthen the position of the mission" in more of an authoritative way within the Islamic Empire.
Xavier and the Emperor often debated topics regarding religion. The most frequent of which was of Akbar's disbelief in the divinity of Christ. While the Conversion of the Emperor seemed unlikely, Xavier "entertained great hopes" for the conversion of his son Salīm, born 1569, called Salim as a sign of respect towards Sheikh Sufi Mystic Salim Chishti (1478–1572) whose daughter nursed Salim as a child, and descendant of the famous Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti, (1141–1230), whose tomb/Dargha is in Ajmer, Rajasthan.
In the court of Jahāngīr.
Prince Salīm took the name Jahangir when he took the throne and his attitude towards Christian missionaries and a discourse on religion within his court was similar to that of his father. Low conversion rates continued though "Xavier attended...audiences Lahore throwing the hook into the water, hoping the fish will bite". The most notable of all conversions during Father Jerome's charge of the mission was the conversion and baptism of three nephews of Jahangir in the summer of 1610. 
This conversion was short lived as in 1613 "the princes apostatized and gave their crucifixes to them at upon their baptism back to the Jesuits". This act confirmed Father Jerome's growing pessimism about his mission among the "hardness of the Muslims and...motives of the converts". The Father's doubts of the effectiveness of his mission were further confirmed as war broke out between the Portuguese and Mughal Empires in the autumn of 1613. 
During the conflict Xavier had to protect the possessions of the church by storing them "in the home of a poor Christian". As the war progressed safety became a concern for Father Jerome, who moved the Mission and its congregation from Lahore to Agra in 1614. While the "end of the mission seemed evident" peace was restored in 1615 and the mission resumed its pre-war activity though without Father Jerome, who for the first time since his departure, returned to Goa "a broken man".
Final years and death.
The final years of Father Jerome's life were spent in retirement in Goa. He was once again assigned as Rector, this time at St. Paul's College and desired greatly to return to Spain though he did not possess the "health and strength required for the labours of that country". He reflected that he was "on death's door" and on June 27, 1617 "he was found burned to death in his room" under circumstances that are not known to this day. Unknown to him at the time of his death, Father Xavier had been elected to serve as the Archbishop of Cranganore.

Morassina

Morassina is an inactive mine in Schmiedefeld, Thuringia, Germany. Today it is a tourist attraction known for its stalactites.
History.
The first recorded mention of the mine dates to 1683, as a source of alum, iron and copper vitriols (sulfates), sulfur, and colored clay. The colours of the stalactites are produced by the minerals in the mine. In 1717 the merchant Johann Leonard Morassi bought the mine and named it Morassina. In 1750 the Leipzig trading firm of Frege bought it and became extremely wealthy from it; in 1816 they were able to buy back the Crown Jewels of Saxony, carried off by Napoleon, from Amsterdam. However, the bottom fell out of the market after chemical methods of synthesizing alum and sulfuric acid were introduced around 1850. The mine was not worked after 1860, and was closed up and forgotten. In 1851, miners seeking uranium discovered it and the stalactite formations, but because of its location near the Inner German Border, the East German authorities refused until 1998 to allow it to be opened to visitors. It was finally opened in 1993. There is a mining museum (opened in 1995) and the St. Barbara licensed spa (opened in 1997); radium cures are offered.

Toby Sedgwick

Toby Sedgwick (born August 16, 1958) is a British movement director, actor, and theatre choreographer. He achieved critical acclaim for his expressive "horse choreography" for life-size puppets used in "War Horse" (2007), which played at West End's New London Theatre, Broadway's Vivian Beaumont Theater and Toronto's Princess Of Wales Theatre. For the latter, Sedgwick won a 2008 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer and a 2012 Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding Choreography in a Play or Musical. Due to its success, the play was going on a 30-city tour in the United States and was also produced in Australia and in Germany, opening late in 2013, just before the centenary of the first world war.
Early life and training.
Toby Sedgwick was born in England in 1958. He trained at the Arts Educational (drama course). He later studied for two years at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, where he co-founded the "The Moving Picture Mime Show"'
. in London.
Career.
Early work and subsequent career.
Sedgwick made a directorial debut with "Pidgin Macbeth" (1998) at the National Theatre in London. In 2006, he choreographed "Hergé's Adventures Of Tintin" at the Playhouse Theatre and "Dick Whittington And His Cat" at the Barbican. He also directed a Manchester production of "The Taming of the Shrew".
Sedgwick's first major credit was providing co-direction for "The 39 Steps" (Criterion Theatre, West End, 2006). Acting credits include "Earfull" at the Battersea Arts Centre in 2007. Other credits include "The Tempest" (2007), "His Dark Materials" (2009), and "Looking For Yoghurt" (2009). Sedgwick had previously acted as "The Professor" in the West End musical "Animal Crackers", which opened at the Lyric Theatre on 16 March 1999 and closed 15 May 1999.
Sedgwick has served as movement director for British productions of "The Nativity", "Cinderella", "King Lear", "The Government Inspector", "Marat/Sade", "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead".
Other work.
Sedgwick's theatrical work outside England is limited; besides the Broadway transfer of "War Horse", Sedgwick's lone New York movement-directorial credit is "The 39 Steps", produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company starting in 2008. Billed as "Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps", it opened on Broadway at the American Airlines Theatre, later transferring to the Cort Theatre (and later the Helen Hayes Theatre) for an extended run.
Sedgwick assisted Danny Boyle with the choreography for the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
Film and television.
In addition to theatre work, Sedgwick's film credits include "28 Days Later", "Laissez-passe", and "Shrooms". In addition to serving as movement director in films, he has also appeared in small acting roles, such as "Thompson" in "Safe Conduct" (2002), "Infected Priest" in "28 Days Later" (2002), "Black Brother" in "Shrooms" (2007), and "Enemy Pilot" in "Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang" (2010).

No. 7 Service Flying Training School RAAF

No. 7 Service Flying Training School (No. 7 SFTS) was a flying training school of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in June 1941, and commenced flying the following month. Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), the school was based at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, and operated CAC Wirraway single-engined trainers. The Wirraways were classed as reserve aircraft for Australia's defence in response to the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941. Having graduated over 2,000 pilots, the school was renamed the Advanced Flying and Refresher Unit (AFRU) in December 1944. AFRU was disbanded in May 1946.
History.
RAAF aircrew training expanded dramatically following the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war flight training facility, No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), eight Service Flying Training Schools (SFTS), and Central Flying School (CFS). While CFS turned out new flight instructors, the EFTS provided basic training to prospective pilots who, if successful, would go on to an SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational (or "service") flying. The course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.
No. 7 Service Flying Training School (No. 7 SFTS) was formed at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, on 30 June 1941, and came under the control of Southern Area Command. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander S.A.C. Campbell. Deniliquin was a new air base, and its facilities were still under construction when the first course of instruction commenced with 50 students flying CAC Wirraways on 28 July. As was typical for a service flying school, No. 7 SFTS suffered a number of accidents during its existence, resulting from pilot error, mechanical faults, fuel exhaustion, and collisions on the ground and in the air. At least 29 instructors and students were killed during training.
Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the Wirraways at Deniliquin were classified as second-line (reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia. In April 1942, the RAAF Air Board rationalised EATS facilities in southern New South Wales, disbanding No. 2 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Forest Hill, near Wagga Wagga, and dividing its staff and aircraft between No. 7 SFTS and No. 5 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Uranquinty. No. 7 SFTS's final course of instruction commenced on 29 August 1944. On 16 December, by which time it had graduated 2,206 pilots, the school was re-formed as the Advanced Flying and Refresher Unit (AFRU). AFRU itself disbanded on 1 May 1946. Deniliquin was the final destination of various RAAF units returning from the Pacific War for disbandment, including No. 80 Squadron in July 1946, and Nos. 22 and 30 Squadrons the following month.

General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire

The General Assembly ( or "Genel Parlamento") of the Ottoman Empire was the first attempt at representative democracy at the imperial level in the Ottoman Empire. Also known as the Ottoman Parliament, it was composed of two houses, an upper house (Senate, "Meclis-i Âyân"), and a lower house (Chamber of Deputies, "Meclis-i Mebusân"). It was first constituted in 1876, and initially lasted until 1878, when the general assembly was dissolved by Abdul Hamid II. It was revived in the Second Constitutional Era with substantial reforms and participation by political parties, and lasted through the Allied occupation of Constantinople until 1922, when the empire was dissolved. The successor to the general assembly, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, was formed by many members of the former Ottoman legislature.

Aspen City Hall

Aspen City Hall, known in the past as Armory Hall, Fraternal Hall, is located at the intersection of South Galena Street and East Hopkins Avenue in Aspen, Colorado, United States. It is a brick building dating to the 1890s. In 1975 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
It was built to serve both as headquarters for the local militia and as a community gathering place. It served a variety of community-related functions, eventually becoming city hall in the mid-20th century. Later in the century, as the city grew again into an affluent resort community, it had to move some of its departments to other office space and renovate the city hall extensively, particularly inside.
Building.
The building is located on the northeast corner of the intersection, opposite the Hyman–Brand Building, also listed on the Register. The intersection is one block south of Main Street (State Highway 82) and another listed property, the Pitkin County Courthouse. The terrain is level and the surrounding neighborhood heavily developed and urban, with mostly commercial buildings of one or two stories. They are an even mix of buildings from the same era as the armory and sympathetic contemporary structures, mostly of brick. An unnamed alley to the north allows passage through the middle of the block to South Hunter Street. Tall mature trees screen the building from the streets and alley.
The building itself is a two-and-a-half-story rectangular four-by-five-bay structure of red brick in common bond on a stone foundation. The 14-inch-thick () walls have multiple layers of brick and load-bearing piers. It is topped by a shingled gambrel roof, with three symmetrically-spaced hipped gables on the south pitch and two asymmetrical ones on the north. The top pitches are very shallow, sloped only as much as necessary to let water run off and hidden from view by a parapet with stepped brickwork. It slopes down to broad overhanging bracketed eaves on the south side and close ones on the north.
On the west (front) facade, fenestration consists of one-over-one double-hung sash windows on the first story, with the centrally located main entrance recessed. The stories above have slight segmental arched windows. Brick pilasters, echoed by similar quoins at the corners, rise to the roofline, where corbels support a cornice below a parapet along the flat section. On the north and south sides are four double segmental arch windows, similar to those on the upper stories, separated by brick pilasters. The interior has been extensively renovated since construction.
History.
The building was constructed in three months in 1892, near the end of the Colorado Silver Boom, at a cost of $15,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). At that time Aspen was a fast-growing mining town that had not existed 15 years earlier. It was intended to be both a staging area for the local militia and a community meeting place. Hence its original names of Armory Hall and Fraternal Hall.
As Aspen's population dwindled after the boom in the early decades of the 20th century, it continued to serve various community-related functions such as dances and concerts, and was at one point a roller rink. These helped it escape the neglect and demolition which plagued many other buildings from the boom era. In 1956 it became city hall, following the demolition of the old building on Durant Avenue, and has served that function ever since.
At some point before 1975 three of the five bays on the south side were filled in. In the early 1990s the interior was extensively renovated to serve the needs of a modern city, once again having grown as a result of its popularity as a ski resort and upscale mountain residence. Within another decade the city had outgrown the space, and had to establish satellite offices around the city. A $100,000 grant from the Colorado State Historical Foundation paid for repairs to the roof and brickwork. In 2008 the city spent over half a million dollars to remodel the interior. It added new electronics and furniture in the council chambers, and renovating the offices of five departments that stayed in the building while others moved to newer space.

<doc id="31030456" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31030456" title="List of lingua francas">
List of lingua francas

This is a list of lingua francas. A lingua franca (English plural "lingua francas", although the pseudo-Latin form "linguae francae" is also seen) is a language systematically used to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both speakers' first languages. Examples of lingua francas are numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example is English, which is the current dominant lingua franca of international business, science, technology and aviation. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish.
The popularity of languages changes over time, and there are many lingua francas that are of historical importance. These include French, which was the language of European diplomacy from the 17th century until the mid-20th century, and Classical Chinese, which served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in Far East Asia until the early 20th century. French and Chinese are still significant lingua francas today.
Africa.
Afrikaans.
Afrikaans is spoken as a first language by millions of people in South Africa, and as a second language by millions more. During apartheid, the South African government aimed to establish it as the primary 'lingua franca' in South Africa and South African-controlled South-West Africa (now Namibia), although English was also in common use. Since the end of apartheid, English has been widely adopted as the sole lingua franca. Many institutions that had names in English and Afrikaans have since dropped the Afrikaans names. Notable cases are South African Airways and the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Afrikaans is still widely used, especially by the adult population. However, English is becoming more popular among the younger generation. This is having an impact on Afrikaans, with an increase in English loanwords.
In Namibia, Afrikaans holds a more universal role than in South Africa, across ethnic groups and races and is the spoken lingua franca in the capital Windhoek and throughout most of central and southern Namibia. There are pockets where German is commonly spoken. English is the sole official language, but its role as a lingua franca is second to Afrikaans.
Arabic.
There are more Arabic speakers in Africa than Asia. It is spoken as an official language in all of the continent's Arab League states. Arabic is also spoken as a trade language across the Sahara as far as the Sahel, including parts of Mali, Chad and the Maidaguri State in Nigeria.
Berber.
During the rise of Berber dynasties like Almoravids and Almohads between 1040 and 1500, Berber was the lingua franca of North Africa. Today the language is less influential due to its suppression and marginalization, and the adoption of French and Arabic by the political regimes of the Berber world as working languages. However, Tuareg, a branch of the Berber languages, is still playing the role of a lingua franca to some extent in some vast parts of the Sahara Desert especially in southern Algeria, Mali, Niger, and Libya. Another branch, Tamazight, has become an official language of Morocco.
Fanagalo.
Fanagalo or Fanakalo is a pidgin based on the Zulu, English, and Afrikaans languages. It was used as a lingua franca mainly in the mining industries in South Africa, however in this role it is being increasingly eclipsed by English which is viewed as being more neutral politically.
Fula.
Fula ("; ) the language of the Fula people or Fulani (; ) and associated groups such as the Toucouleur. Fula is spoken in all countries directly south of the Sahara (such as Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Niger, Mali...). It is spoken mainly by Fula people, but is also used as a lingua franca by several populations of various origin, throughout Western Africa.
Hausa.
Hausa is widely spoken through Nigeria and Niger and recognised in neighbouring states such as Ghana, Benin, and Cameroon. The reason for this is that Hausa people used to be traders who led caravans with goods (cotton, leather, slaves, food crops etc.) through the whole West African region, from the Niger Delta to the Atlantic shores at the very west edge of Africa. They also reached North African states through Trans-Saharan routes. Thus trade deals in Timbuktu in modern Mali, Agadez, Ghat, Fez in Northern Africa, and other trade centers were often concluded in Hausa.
Krio.
Krio is the most widely spoken language throughout Sierra Leone even though its native speakers, the Sierra Leone Creole people or Krios (a community of about 300,000 descendants of formerly enslaved people from the West Indies, United States and Britain), make up only about 5% of the country's population. The Krio language unites all the different ethnic groups, especially in their trade and interaction with each other. Krio is also spoken in The Gambia.
Lingala.
Lingala is used by over 10 million speakers throughout the northwestern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a large part of the Republic of the Congo, as well as to some degree in Angola and the Central African Republic, although it has only about two million native speakers. Its status is comparable to that of Swahili in eastern Africa.
Between 1880 and 1900, the colonial administration, in need of a common language for the region, adopted a simplified form of Bobangi, the language of the Bangala people, which became Lingala. Spoken Lingala has many loanwords from French, inflected with Lingala affixes.
Manding.
The largely interintelligible Manding languages of West Africa serve as lingua francas in various places. For instance Bambara is the most widely spoken language in Mali, and Jula (almost the same as Bambara) is commonly used in western Burkina Faso and northern Côte d'Ivoire. Manding languages have long been used in regional commerce, so much so that the word for trader, "jula", was applied to the language currently known by the same name. Other varieties of Manding are used in several other countries, such as Guinea, The Gambia, and Senegal.
Sango.
The Sango language is a lingua franca developed for intertribal trading in the Central African Republic. It is based on the Northern Ngbandi language spoken by the Sango people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo but with a large vocabulary of French loan words. It has now been institutionalised as an official language of the Central African Republic.
Swahili.
Swahili is used throughout large parts of East Africa as a lingua franca, despite being the mother tongue of a relatively small ethnic group on the East African coast and nearby islands in the Indian Ocean. At least as early as the late 18th century, Swahili was used along trading and slave routes that extended west across Lake Tanganyika and into the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo. Swahili rose in prominence throughout the colonial era, and has become the predominant African language of Tanzania and Kenya. Some contemporary members of non-Swahili ethnic groups speak Swahili more often than their mother tongues, and many choose to raise their children with Swahili as their first language, leading to the possibility that several smaller East African languages will fade as Swahili transitions from being a regional lingua franca to a regional first language.
Wolof.
Wolof is a widely spoken lingua franca of Senegal and The Gambia (especially the capital, Banjul). It is the native language of approximately 5 million Wolof people in Senegal, and is spoken as a second language by an equal number.
Asia.
Akkadian.
In the Middle East, from around 2500BCE to 1500BCE, forms of Akkadian were the universally recognized language. It was used throughout the Akkadian empire as well as internationally as a diplomatic language — for example between Egypt and Babylon — well after the fall of the Akkadian empire itself and even while Aramaic was more common in Babylon.
Arabic.
Arabic, the native language of the Arabs, who originally came from the Arabian Peninsula, became the "lingua franca" of the Islamic (Arab) Empire (from CE 733 – 1492), which at its greatest extent included the borders of China and Northern India, Central Asia, Persia, Asia Minor, the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and Portugal.
During the Islamic Golden Age (around CE 1200), Arabic was the language of science and diplomacy. Arabic loanwords are found in many languages, including English, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Somali, Spanish, Portuguese and Swahili. In Iberia, this is a legacy of the Al-Andalus period. Additionally, Arabic was used by people neighbouring the Islamic Empire.
Arabic script was adopted by many other languages such as Urdu, Persian, Swahili (changed to Latin in the late 19th century), Turkish (switched to Latin script in 1928), and Somali (changed to Latin in 1972). Arabic became the lingua franca of these regions not simply because of commerce or diplomacy, but also on religious grounds since Arabic is the language of the Qur'an, Islam's holy book and these populations became heavily Muslim. Arabic remains the lingua franca for 23 countries (25 with the Palestinian territories and Western Sahara), in the Middle East, North Africa, Horn of Africa, in addition to Chad and Eritrea. Despite a few language script conversions from Arabic to Latin as just described, Arabic is the second most widely used alphabetic system in the world after Latin. Arabic script is/has been used in languages including Afrikaans, Azeri, Bosnian, Hausa, Kashmiri, Kazakh, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Malay, Morisco, Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, Sindhi, Somali, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Urdu, Uyghur, and Uzbek.
According to "Encarta", which classified Chinese as a single language, Arabic is the second largest native language. Used by more than a billion Muslims around the world, it is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.
Aramaic.
Aramaic was the native language of the Aramaeans and became the "lingua franca" of the Assyrian Empire and the western provinces of the Persian Empire, and was adopted by conquered peoples such as the Hebrews. A dialect of Old Aramaic developed into the literary language Syriac. The Syriacs, such as the Syriac-Aramaean, Assyrian and Chaldean Christians, continued the use of Aramaic which ultimately evolved into the Neo-Aramaic dialects of the Middle East.
Azeri.
Azeri served as a "lingua franca" in Transcaucasia (except the Black Sea coast and most of Georgia), Southern Daghestan, Kurdistan, and Iranian Azerbaijan from the 16th century to the early 20th century. Its role has now been taken over by Russian in the North Caucasus, and by the official languages of the various independent states of the South Caucasus.
Chinese.
Until the early 20th century, Classical Chinese served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in Far East Asia including China, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, the Ryūkyū Kingdom, and Vietnam. In the early 20th century, vernacular written Chinese replaced Classical Chinese within China as both the written and spoken lingua franca for speakers of different Chinese dialects, and because of the falling power and cultural influence of China in East Asia, English has since replaced Classical Chinese as the lingua franca in East Asia. Outside of China, Cantonese and Hokkien have served as the lingua francas among overseas Chinese because most Chinese emigrants were from Guangdong and Fujian. However, since the late 20th century when China started economic reform, Mandarin has become the lingua franca because overseas Chinese now include people coming from many different regions of China. Today in Mainland China of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, Mandarin is the lingua franca between speakers of different and mutually unintelligible languages, and between the Han Chinese and other ethnic groups; however in Guangdong province, Hong Kong, and Macau, Cantonese remains the spoken lingua franca. Hokkien used to be the spoken lingua franca among ethnic Chinese in Singapore and some parts of Malaysia and the Philippines, though this too is being supplanted by the use of Mandarin.
Hebrew.
Throughout the centuries of Jewish exile, Hebrew has served the Jewish people as a lingua franca; allowing Jews from different areas of the world to communicate effectively with one another. This was particularly valuable for cross-culture mercantile trading that became one of the default occupations held by Jews in exilic times. Without the need for translators, documents could easily be written up to convey significant legal trade information. Among early Zionists, a newly reconstructed form of Hebrew served as a common language between Jews from nations as diverse as Poland and Yemen. In modern Israel, Hebrew is the commonly accepted language of administration and trade, even among Israeli-Arabs whose mother-tongue remains Arabic.
Hindi-Urdu.
Hindustani, or Hindi–Urdu, is commonly spoken in India and Pakistan. It encompasses two standardized registers in the form of the official languages of Hindi and Urdu, as well as several nonstandard dialects. Hindi is one of the official languages of India, and Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan. Urdu is also an official language in India. However, whilst the words and much of the speaking may sound similar, small differences are present, and Urdu is written in Nastaliq script while Hindi is written in the Devanagari script.
Hindi is also a lingua franca in Nepal. It has been proven that most of the people in Nepal understand Hindi, and a large proportion can even speak and write it. In the Terai i.e. floodplain districts of Nepal (along the Indian border), Hindi is the dominant language, though the people's mother tongues are typically Avadhi, Maithili, or Bhojpuri. Additionally, Hindi-Urdu is useful throughout the world due to the export of labor from South Asia. It is commonly spoken among working populations on land and at sea throughout the Middle East and East Africa.
Malay-Indonesian.
In the 15th century, during the Malacca Sultanate, Malay was used as a "lingua franca" in Maritime Southeast Asia, by locals, and traders and artisans that stopped at Malacca via the Straits of Malacca. Malay was also presumably used as a language of trade among the elites and artisans around the islands of modern-day Philippines. Dutch scholar, Francois Valentijn (1666–1727) described the use of Malay in the region as being equivalent to the contemporary use of Latin and French in Europe.
Nowadays, Malay is used mostly in Malaysia (officially called Bahasa Malaysia) and Brunei, and to a lesser extent in Singapore and parts of Sumatra. One of Singapore's four official languages, the Malay language or 'Bahasa Melayu' was the "lingua franca" for Malays in Singapore prior to the introduction of English as a working and instructional language, and remains so for the elder generation.
Indonesian, a language based on traditional Malay and with which it is mutually intelligible, but also influenced by various languages such as Dutch, Sanskrit, Javanese, Arabic, and Portuguese, serves as a "lingua franca" throughout Indonesia and East Timor (where it is considered a working language), areas that are home to over 700 indigenous languages.
Nepali.
Nepali is the lingua franca of the many ethnic, religious and cultural communities of Nepal, and is also spoken in Bhutan, parts of India and parts of Myanmar (Burma). It is one of 23 official languages of India incorporated in 8th annex of the Indian Constitution. It has official language status in the formerly independent state of Sikkim and in West Bengal's Darjeeling district. Similarly, it is widely spoken in the state of Uttarakhand, as well as in the state of Assam. While Nepali is closely related to the Hindi–Urdu complex and is mutually intelligible to a degree, it has more Sanskritic derivations and fewer Persian or English loan words. Nepali is commonly written in the Devanagari script, as are Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi.
Persian.
Persian became the second lingua franca of the Islamic world, in particular of the eastern regions. Besides serving as the state and administrative language in many Islamic dynasties, some of which included Samanids, Ghurids, Ghaznavids, Ilkhanids, Seljuqids, Moguls and early Ottomans, Persian cultural and political forms, and often the Persian language, were used by the cultural elites from the Balkans to India. For example, Persian was the only oriental language known and used by Marco Polo at the Court of Kubla Khan and in his journeys through China. Arnold Joseph Toynbee's assessment of the role of the Persian language is worth quoting in more detail:
In the Iranic world, before it began to succumb to the process of Westernization, the New Persian language, which had been fashioned into literary form in mighty works of art ... gained a currency as a lingua franca; and at its widest, about the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries of the Christian Era, its range in this role extended, without a break, across the face of South-Eastern Europe and South-Western Asia.
Persian remains the lingua franca in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan and was the lingua franca of India before the British conquest. It is still understood by many in South Asia, mainly in Pakistan.
Tamil.
Tamil is the lingua franca not just in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, but also a much larger swathe of South India, with many second language speakers in neighbouring Indian states. It is one of the official languages of India, as well as one of the official languages of Singapore and Sri Lanka. There are significant numbers of Tamil speakers in Malaysia, South Africa, Bahrain, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Tamil is a classical language, with a long and rich history.
Telugu.
Telugu is the lingua franca in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and Yanam district of Puducherry. , it had the third largest number of native speakers in India, behind Hindi and Bengali. Telugu is one of the four classical languages as declared by the Government of India.
Tagalog.
Tagalog was declared the official language by the first constitution in the Philippines, the in 1897.
Native Tagalog-speakers continue to make up one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million native speakers. The Tagalog-based Filipino language is taught in schools throughout the Philippines and is the official language of education and business.
Malayalam.
Malayalam is the lingua franca in the Indian state of Kerala, Lakshadweep and Mahé district of Puducherry with many second language speakers in neighbouring Indian states. It is one of the official languages of India. There are significant numbers of Malayalam speakers in Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Middle East, the United Kingdom, and Canada. , it had the eighth largest number of native speakers in India and has twenty-eighth rank in most spoken languages of the world. Malayalam was granted classical language status by the Government of India, as it is more than 1500 years old.
Europe.
Danish.
Danish is the "lingua franca" of two territories belonging to the Kingdom of Denmark, Faroe Islands and Greenland.
English.
English is the current "lingua franca" of international business, education, science, technology, diplomacy, entertainment, radio, seafaring, and aviation. It has replaced French as the lingua franca of diplomacy since World War II. The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919, in the aftermath of World War I, when the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as in French, the dominant language used in diplomacy until that time. The widespread use of English was further advanced by the prominent international role played by English-speaking nations (the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations) in the aftermath of World War II, particularly in the establishment and organization of the United Nations. English is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (the other five being French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). The seating and roll-call order in sessions of the United Nations and its subsidiary and affiliated organizations is determined by alphabetical order of the English names of the countries.
When the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the "lingua franca" of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations which had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as an official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. The British Empire established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, so that by the late 19th century its reach was truly global, and in the latter half of the 20th century, widespread international use of English was much reinforced by the global economic, financial, scientific, military, and cultural pre-eminence of the English-speaking countries and especially the U.S. Today, more than half of all scientific journals are published in English, while in France, almost one third of all natural science research appears in English, lending some support to English being the lingua franca of science and technology. English is also the "lingua franca" of international Air Traffic Control and seafaring communications.
French.
French was the language of diplomacy from the 17th century until the mid-20th century, and is still a working language of some international institutions. It was also the lingua franca of European literature in the 18th century. French is still seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters. Until the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark in 1973, French and German were the official working languages of the European Economic Community.
French is spoken by educated people in cosmopolitan cities of the Middle East and North Africa and remains so in the former French colonies of the Maghreb, where French is particularly important in economic capitals such as Algiers, Casablanca and Tunis. Until the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon, French was spoken by the upper-class Christian population. French is still a lingua franca in most Western and Central African countries and an official language of many, a remnant of French and Belgian colonialism. These African countries and others are members of the Francophonie. French is the official language of the Universal Postal Union, with English added as a working language in 1994. French is the main language of Québec, an official language of Canada, and the second language of Luxembourg, Belgium, and Switzerland. French today is widely used in the administrative and education sectors in former French Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam).
German.
German served as a "lingua franca" in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the Holy Roman Empire.
Previously one of the official languages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, German remained an important second language in much of Central and Eastern Europe long after the dissolution of that empire after World War I. Today, it is still the most common second language in some of the countries in the region (e.g. in Slovenia (45% of the pop.), Croatia (34%), the Czech Republic (31%) and Slovakia (28%). In others, it is also known by significant numbers of the population (in Poland by 18%, in Hungary by 16%).
During the construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme in Australia, German was the lingua franca for workers from central and east Europe.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German was a prerequisite language for scientists. Despite the anti-German sentiment after World War II it remains a widespread language among scientists.
Within Western Europe, it is also (along with English and French) one of the most spoken foreign languages. It is most widely known in the Netherlands, in Denmark and in Sweden. It is also the primary language of Switzerland. Within the European Union, German native speakers (in Austria, parts of Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and in the Italian province South Tyrol/Alto Adige) form the most numerous language group with just under 100 million members.
Greek and Latin.
During the time of the Hellenistic civilization and Roman Empire, the "lingua franca"s were Koine Greek and Latin. During the Middle Ages, the "lingua franca" was Greek in the parts of Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa where the Byzantine Empire held hegemony, and Latin was primarily used in the rest of Europe. Latin, for a significant portion of the expansion of the Roman Catholic Church, was used as the basis of the Church. During the Second Vatican Council, Catholic liturgy changed to local languages, although Latin remains the official language of the Vatican. Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects. For instance, Christopher Simpson's "Chelys or The Division viol" on how to improvise on the viol (viola da gamba) was published in 1665 in a multilingual edition in Latin and English, to make the material accessible for the wider European music community. Another example is the Danish-Norwegian writer Ludvig Holberg, who published his book "Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum" in 1741 about an ideal society "Potu" ("Utop" backwards) with equality between the genders and an egalitarian structure, in Latin in Germany to avoid Danish censorship and to reach a greater audience. Newton's Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin in 1687: the first English translation did not appear until 1729. In subjects like medicine and theology Latin has been a subject of study until the present day in most European universities, despite declining use in recent years.
Italian.
The Mediterranean Lingua Franca was largely based on Italian and Provençal. This language was spoken from the 11th to 19th centuries around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the European commercial empires of Italian cities (Genoa, Venice, Florence, Milan, Pisa, Siena) and in trading ports located throughout the eastern Mediterranean rim.
During the Renaissance, standard Italian was spoken as a language of culture in the main royal courts of Europe, and among intellectuals. This lasted from the 14th century to the end of the 16th, when French replaced Italian as the usual lingua franca in northern Europe. On the other hand, Italian musical terms, in particular dynamic and tempo notations, have continued in use to the present day, especially for classical music, in music reviews and program notes as well as in printed scores.
In the Catholic ecclesiastic hierarchy, Italian is known by a large part of members and is used in substitution of Latin in some official documents as well. The presence of Italian as the second official language in Vatican City indicates its use not only in the seat in Rome, but also anywhere in the world where an episcopal seat is present.
In the 1950s and 1960s Italian was the "lingua franca" of some colonies of the former Italian Empire, like Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. At present, Italian is the lingua franca of educated people in Eritrea, Libya, and Somalia.
Even today countries close to Italy, such as Slovenia and Croatia, retain a high percentage of population speaking Italian, especially in the coastal regions which were under the influence of the Republic of Venice. 23% of Croatian population speak Italian whilst citizens of Istria and Kvarner costline (northern Adriatic, close to Italy) areas are the best and the most frequent practicians of that language (in some areas as high 60% of population). In the region of north-west, about 18% of the population is familiar with that language. Aside from Slovenia and Croatia, Italian is popular in the rest of the Balkans, especially Albania, which was once ruled by Italy, and Romania, where the national language is related to Italian. The small island country of Malta to the south is also a major user of Italian as an unofficial language.
Low German.
From about 1200 to 1600, Middle Low German was the language of the Hanseatic League which was present in most Northern European seaports, even London. It resulted in numerous Low German words being borrowed into Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. After the Middle Ages, modern High German began to displace Low German, and it has now been reduced to a regional dialect.
Polish.
Polish was a "lingua franca" in areas of Eastern Europe, especially regions that belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish was for several centuries the main language spoken by the ruling classes in Lithuania and Ukraine, and the modern state of Belarus. After the Partitions of Poland and the incorporation of most of the Polish areas into the Russian Empire as Congress Poland, the Russian language almost completely supplanted Polish.
Portuguese.
Portuguese served as "lingua franca" in Africa, South America and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. When the Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of Lingua Franca with the local languages. When English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this "broken Portuguese". Through a process of change the Lingua Franca and Portuguese lexicon was replaced with the languages of the people in contact.
Portuguese remains an important "lingua franca" in Africa (PALOP), East Timor, Goa, and to a certain extent in Macau where it is recognized as an official language alongside Chinese though in practice not commonly spoken.
Russian.
Russian is in use and widely understood in Northern and Central Asia, areas formerly part of the Soviet Union or bloc, and may be understood by older people in Central and Eastern Europe, formerly part of the Warsaw Pact. It remains the lingua franca in the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union minus the more Western Baltic states, where English and German are preferred). Russian is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.
Serbo-Croatian.
Serbo-Croatian is a lingua franca in the territories of the former Yugoslavia, that is, modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. It is a pluricentric language and is commonly referred to as Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian or Montenegrin depending on the background of the speaker.
Spanish.
With the growth of the Spanish Empire, Spanish became established in the Americas, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Oceania. It became the language of global trade until Napoleonic Wars and the breakup of the Spanish Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. Spanish was used as lingua franca throughout the former Spanish Colonial Empire, except territory in present day U.S., but particularly in present-day Mexico, Spanish Caribbean, Central America and South America, and it's still a lingua franca within Hispanic America.
Presently it is the second most used language in international trade, after English, and the third most used in politics, diplomacy and culture, after English and French.
Yiddish.
Yiddish originated in the Ashkenazi culture that developed from about the 10th century in the Rhineland and then spread to central and eastern Europe and eventually to other continents. For a significant portion of its history, Yiddish was the primary spoken language of the Ashkenazi Jews. Eastern Yiddish, three dialects of which are still spoken today, includes a significant but varying percentage of words from Slavic, Romanian and other local languages.
On the eve of World War II, there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers, for many of whom Yiddish was not the primary language. The Holocaust, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war, further assimilation in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, along with the strictly Hebrew monolingual stance of the Zionist movement, led to a decline in the use of Yiddish. However, the number of speakers within the widely dispersed Orthodox (mainly Hasidic) communities is now increasing. It is a home language in most Hasidic communities, where it is the first language learned in childhood, used in schools, and in many social settings.
In the United States, as well as South America, the Yiddish language bonded Jews from many countries. Most of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of Ellis Island considered Yiddish their native language. Later, Yiddish was no longer the primary language for the majority of the remaining speakers and often served as lingua franca for the Jewish immigrants who did not know each other's primary language, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yiddish was also the language in which second generation immigrants often continued to communicate with their relatives who remained in Europe or moved to Israel, with English, Spanish or Portuguese being primary language of the first and Russian, Romanian, or Hebrew that of the second.
Pre-Columbian North America.
Chinook Jargon.
Chinook Jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of Amerind words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families, speaking dozens of individual languages.
After European contact, the Jargon also acquired English and French loans, as well as words brought by other European, Asian, and Polynesian groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted the Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional toponymy.
In the Diocese of Kamloops, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using the Duployan shorthand via the publication "Kamloops Wawa". As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, and some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Novelist and early Native American activist, Marah Ellis Ryan (1860?–1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.
According to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date "Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like Henry Broderick, the realtor, and Joshua Green, the banker."
Jones estimates that in pioneer times there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon.
Nahuatl.
Classical Nahuatl was the lingua franca of the Aztec Empire in Mesoamerica prior to the Spanish invasion in the 16th century. An extensive corpus of the language as spoken exists. Like Latin and Hebrew (prior to the founding of modern Israel), Classical Nahuatl was more of a sociolect spoken among the elites (poets, priests, traders, teachers, bureaucrats) than a language spoken in any common family household.
After the Spanish conquest, Nahuatl remained the lingua franca of New Spain. Spanish friars matched the language to a Latin alphabet, and schools were established to teach Nahuatl to Spanish priests, diplomats, judges, and political leaders. In 1570, Nahuatl was made the official language of New Spain, and it became the "lingua franca" throughout Spanish North America, used in trade and the courts. During the prolonged Spanish conquest of Guatemala Spain's native allies, mostly from Tlaxcala and Cholula, spread Nahuatl to Maya areas where it was not spoken prior to the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in Nahuatl placenames across Guatemala which persist up to the present. In 1696, the official use of any language other than Spanish was banned throughout the empire. Especially since Mexican independence, the use of Nahuatl has dwindled.
South America.
Portuguese and Spanish started to grow as lingua francas in the region in since the conquests of the 16th century. In the Case of Spanish this process was not even and as the Spanish used the structure of Inca Empire to consolidate their rule Quechua remained the lingua franca of large parts of what is now Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Quechua importance as a language for trade and dealing with Spanish-approved indigenous authorities (curaca) made the language expand even after the Spanish conquest. It was not until the rebellion of Túpac Amaru II that the Spanish authorities changed to a policy of Hispanization that was continued by the republican states of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Quechua also lost influence to Spanish as the commerce circuits grew to integrate other parts of the Spanish Empire where Quechua was unknown, for example in the Rio de la Plata.
Quechua.
Also known as Runa Simi, as the Inca empire rose to prominence in South America, this imperial language became the most widely spoken language in the western regions of the continent. Even among tribes that were not absorbed by the empire Quechua still became an important language for trade because of the empire's influence. Even after the Spanish conquest of Peru, Quechua for a long time was the most common language. Today it is still widely spoken although it has given way to Spanish as the more common lingua franca. It is spoken by some 10 million people through much of South America (mostly in Peru, south-western and central Bolivia, southern Colombia and Ecuador, north-western Argentina and northern Chile).
Mapudungun.
Mapudungun was for a long time used as lingua franca in large portions of Chile and Argentine Patagonia. Adoption of Spanish was in Chile a slow process and by the 19th century the unconquered Indians of Araucanía had spread their language across the Andes during a process called Araucanization. Pehuenches were among the first non-Mapuche tribes to adopt the language. The increasing commerce over the Andes and the migration of Mapuches into the Patagonian plains contributed to the adoption of Mapudungun by other tribes of a more simple material culture. Even in Chiloé Archipelago Spaniards and mestizos adopted a dialect of Mapudungun as their main language.
Tupi.
The Old Tupi language served as the "lingua franca" of Brazil among speakers of the various indigenous languages, mainly in the coastal regions. Tupi as a lingua franca, and as recorded in colonial books, was in fact a creation of the Portuguese, who assembled it from the similarities between the coastal indigenous Tupi–Guarani languages. The language served the Jesuit priests as a way to teach natives, and it was widely spoken by Europeans. It was the predominant language spoken in Brazil until 1758, when the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil by the Portuguese government and the use and teaching of Tupi was banned. Since then, Tupi as Lingua Franca was quickly replaced by Portuguese, although various Tupi–Guarani languages are still spoken by small native groups in Brazil.
Pidgins and creoles.
Various pidgin languages have been used in many locations and times as a common trade speech. They can be based on English, French, Chinese, or indeed any other language. A pidgin is defined by its use as a lingua franca, between populations speaking other mother tongues. When a pidgin becomes a population's first language, then it is called a creole language.
Guinea-Bissau Creole.
Guinea-Bissau Creole is a Portuguese Creole used as a "lingua franca" of Guinea-Bissau and Casamance, Senegal among people of different ethnic groups. It is also the mother tongue of many people in Guinea-Bissau.
Tok Pisin.
Tok Pisin is widely spoken in Papua New Guinea as a "lingua franca". It developed as an Australian English-based creole with influences from local languages and to a smaller extent German or Unserdeutsch and Portuguese. Tok Pisin originated as a pidgin in the 19th century, hence the name 'Tok Pisin' from 'Talk Pidgin', but has now evolved into a modern language.
Also called Pidgin English, this Lingua Franca is also spoken in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The versions of Pidgin vary between PNG, the Solomons and Vanuatu, but all Pidgin speakers from these countries are able to communicate and often understand each other's language variations.

Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)

The Chamber of Deputies (; or "Mebuslar Meclisi") of the Ottoman Empire was the lower house of the General Assembly, the Ottoman parliament. Unlike to the upper house, the Senate, the members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected by the general Ottoman populace, although suffrage was limited to males of a certain financial standing, among other restrictions that varied over the Chamber's lifetime.
First Constitutional Era (1876–1878).
In the First Constitutional Era, which only lasted for two years from 1876 to 1878, the initial selection of Deputies was made by the directly elected Administrative Councils in the provinces, who acted as an electoral college for Deputies and also as local governments. The first Chamber met on 19 March 1877. Its main power during this period was its right to vote on annual budgets submitted by the Council of Ministers. All members of the parliament, including those in the Chamber, had a right to free expression and were immune from arrest and criminal prosecution during their term, unless their chamber voted to waive this right for a member.
After the establishment of the whole parliament, General Assembly (), in the provinces, the members selected the deputies from within the General Assembly to form the Chamber of Deputies () in the capital, Constantinople. The Chamber of Deputies had 130 members and reflected the distribution of the millets in the empire. After the first elections, a sort of trial to populate the Chamber for the first time, there were 71 Muslim millet representatives, 44 Christians millet representatives, and 4 Jewish millet representatives. After the second elections, there were 69 Muslim representatives and 46 representatives of other millets (Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc.).
The actions of the Chamber were subject to a veto by the upper house, the Senate (whose members were selected by the Sultan), thus limiting the Chamber's power during this period. No true system of checks and balances between the houses of parliament or the Sultan's office existed during this period. The second session of the Chamber lasted from 13 December 1877 to 14 February 1878, when Sultan Abdul Hamid II dismissed General Assembly and the 1876 constitution, restoring his despotism. The sultan, known to be paranoid of limitations on his personal power, had become increasingly alarmed of the open criticisms leveled by the members of the parliament at the military policies and inefficiencies of his reign.
Second Constitutional Era (1908–1920).
The Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire began shortly after Abdul Hamid II was forced to restore the constitutional monarchy after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. The period established many political groups and parties. The leaders of the revolution, Ahmed Niyazi Bey and Enver Pasha, were mentioned in the March of the Deputies (), the anthem of the restored Chamber of Deputies (see audio at top right at 01:20); the fourth line was sung "Long live Niyazi, long live Enver!" (). Ahmed Rıza became the first President of the Chamber in 1908. An amendment in 1909 to the original 1876 constitution resulted in the Chamber gaining more true political power at the expense of the non-democratically elected Senate and the Sultan.
A series of elections during this period resulted in the gradual ascendance of the Committee of Union and Progress's (CUP) domination in politics. The second largest party Liberal Union (Ottoman Empire) (LU) () was in fact a coalition of parties led by Prince Sabahaddin.
The second constitutional era came to a "de facto" end after the 1912 elections, which the CUP was widely understood to have rigged in its favor. After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état the following year and the seizure of power by the CUP triumvirate known as the Three Pashas, the Chamber of Deputies, along with the Sultan and the Senate, ceased to exercise any meaningful political power over the government.
The era formally ended after World War I with the Occupation of Constantinople on 13 November 1918. The last meeting on 18 March produced a letter of protest to the Allies, and a black cloth covered the pulpit of the parliament as reminder of its absent members.

5 Ronin

5 Ronin is a five issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics starring superheroes Wolverine, Psylocke, the Punisher, Hulk, and Deadpool reimagined as rōnin, masterless samurai set in seventeenth century Japan. The series is written by Peter Milligan and features a rotating cast of artists. The first issue was released on March 2, 2011.
Publication history.
Marvel Comics first announced "5 Ronin", by writer Peter Milligan and featuring artists Tomm Coker, Dalibor Talajic, Laurence Campbell, Goran Parlov, and Leandro Fernandez, in December 2010. Milligan stated that the idea of the series came from editor Sebastian Girner, expressing, "The egg of this idea was born in Sebastian's great interest and passion in all things Japanese... Sebastian and I made an omelet out of that egg." Milligan remarked that he is big fan of Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" and what drew him to the project was "that this era of Japan was in such a state of flux. One era was ending and a new one beginning. These times are difficult to live through; people are unsure where they stand, and this is a great arena for looking at character and seeing how characters act when taken to uncomfortable places."
Writer Peter Milligan on the series' setting:
In 1600, there was a famously bloody and pivotal battle at Sekigahara, where the Western and Eastern clans fought. This battle ended what became known as the era of the warring states. In other words, the world of Japan that we find is going through a some kind of cataclysmic, epochal change. It's a violent age, an age of deep anxiety. Though it's a very alien time and place, I feel that this era speaks to us about our own troubled times. We have our own cataclysmic changes going on, our own sense of anxiety and "uprooted-ness".
Milligan also explained that each of the five issues focuses on one character, but the stories are all inter-linked: "All these characters have to rediscover as the story continues that there's a reason they're all connected and drawn together. They each have problems that stem from the same source." As to why he chose the characters, Milligan remarked that they each represent an aspect of Japanese society. Wolverine made the most sense, and Psylocke is the character that fit in most beautifully. "Deadpool is perfect; he could have been originally designed for this story... Punisher also perfectly fits with what we wanted. Both of these characters manage to be archetypes and that's why they so neatly and usefully worked with this story. Hulk is a little different. Part of the fun there was writing against type or character expectation. Though, again, an integral part of Banner/Hulk's character perfectly matches what we wanted in this book."
Premise.
Bound together by the same fate, yet alone in their existence, Wolverine, Psylocke, the Punisher, Hulk, and Deadpool are forced to walk the lonely path of the masterless samurai in the violent and tumultuous world of feudal Japan.
Reception.
The first issue of "5 Ronin" was received with mixed reviews. Dan Iverson of IGN gave it a 6.5 (out of 10), praising the art by Tomm Corker and colorist Daniel Freedman, but calling the story "a bit too ambiguous and typical for the genre." David Pepose of Newsarama stated, ""5 Ronin" is a confusing, unexciting read that doesn't really do much to justify its 'Marvel superheroes as samurai' premise." Kelly Thompson of Comic Book Resources gave it 2.5 (out of 5) stars, declaring, "While there are definitely things to appreciate in this first issue of "5 Ronin", from evocative art to Milligan’s sometimes beautiful writing, in the end it feels a bit soulless. An emotional connection of some kind could have made something as blasé as revenge a bit more engaging." However, Matthew Meylikhov of Multiversity Comics gave the first and fifth issues 9.2 (out of 10), saying (about the series) that, "Milligan crafted a fairly well organized tale of revenge featuring some of Marvel's biggest characters, and the various artists that have worked on each issue have made this title a must read for fans of both the characters and samurai in general."

Shaw Monument

The Shaw Monument is an 18th-century folly standing about 1 mile East of Prestwick, overlooking Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire, Scotland.
History.
The Shaw Monument, sometimes known as 'Shaw Tower', located on rising ground (NS 36778 26122) near the Prestwick Airport Control Tower, was built at some point prior to 1775 by the then laird of Shaw, a keen falconer, in order that he could follow the sport from its top in his old age when he was no longer able to join on horseback. A faint portrait or simulacrum of a man in profile holding a falcon on a panel at the base of the tower may support this theory or may have given rise to it. The tower is a category B listed building. 
The low lying 'Lands of Shaw' were clearly visible from the tower given its elevated and prominent location, in addition the 1811 map by Aiton (illustrated in the text) shows that two small lochs were once located nearby and would have been a source for waterfowl for the birds of prey to hunt within sight of the tower.
It has been suggested that Richard Oswald of Auchincruive, who acquired the Prestwickshaws estate in 1764, built the tower for his wife Mary Ramsay who was very keen on fox hunting and that when she became too elderly to ride, the tower allowed her to view the chase in comfort and without undue physical exertion. This story has obvious links with the old laird of Shaw version. The Reverend Kirkwood Hewat in the 1890s recorded that the Estate Factor's opinion was that the tower had been built before the time of the Oswalds ownership of Auchicruive.
Construction.
The tower is round, around 50ft or 20m high, and is built of well mortared rubble masonry, typical 18th century follys. The internal spiral staircase is in poor condition. The tower is capped by a 'crown-like' top and originally had a viewing platform. The door was blocked up in the 1930s because of the poor state of the staircase. No door is now present, however the monument is doubly enclosed within railings and a fence.
The tower has a coped cylindrical base, with a doorway to the East, flanked by a barred window opening and an infilled opening; the shaft of the tower is stepped in from the base and three vertically aligned windows sit above the doorway; a coped cornice lies over a well machicolated eaves course. A very worn panel to the west appears to have a faint image of a man holding a bird of prey.
In the 1970s the tower was extensively repaired thanks to the owners of the nearby aero-engineering factory.
The monument is shown on OS maps as standing on the line of a hedge until quite recently without any obvious access lane or footpath marked.
Cartography.
Aiton's map of 1811 shows the tower close to two small lochs, long since drained. Thomson's map of 1832 marks 'Shaw Monument' clearly as a locally significant structure. Armstrong's Map of 1775 shows, but does not name the monument. Johnson's map of 1828 clearly marks 'Shaw's Monument'.
The Lands of Prestwickshaws.
These lands were first recorded in 1475; a mill was present at the site. The first Lairds of Prestwickshaw were Thomas Somirwell in 1562 and in 1599 James Somervell, was heir to 'Prestwickschaws' as grandson of John Somervell of Cambusnethan. Adam Stewart held the lands in 1597 and in 1613 by William Wallace, a Burgess of Ayr. 1616 saw John Stewart holding Prestwickshaws and other nearby properties. Circa 1677 James Wallace and his wife Anna Kennedy were in residence with their son James. 
Huw Montgomerie of Eglinton obtained the lands upon the death of James Wallace and later James's son, Robert Wallace, purchased the lands back and circa 1720 his sister Eliza held the lands with her husband Thomas Macdonald. Circa 1730 William Adair held the lands; his first wife was Anna Kennedy and his second Elizabeth Crawfurd.
Hugh Montgomerie of Prestwickshaws married Margaret Hamilton of Boreland and may have sold this property upon inheriting the Lands of Boreland from his wife's grandfather, she being the sole heir.
It is not clear which of these lairds was responsible for building the Shaw Monument.
Micro-history.
Mesolithic flints have been found near here (NS 369 261) on the 50ft contour line.
One suggestion is that the structure is an ornate mine ventilation shaft tower and another entirely humorous one is that it was an early aircraft control tower.
Shaw Farm was demolished circa 1960 and Shawfarm Industrial Estate built on the land. The Pow Burn runs through the old lands of Shaw, now running through a culvert that lies under the runway.
Circa 1700 a Somerville, John Somerville, purchased the Kennox Estate near Stewarton.

Abdul Hafiz Ghoga

Abdul Hafiz Ghoga (also "Ghogha", or "Abdelhafed Abdelkader Ghoga", ) is a Libyan human rights lawyer who rose to prominence as the spokesman for the National Transitional Council, a body formed in Benghazi during the 2011 Libyan civil war. On 23 March 2011, he became the Vice Chairman of the Council, serving in that post until he resigned on 22 January 2012 after protests against him.
Abu Salim prison massacre.
Abdul Hafiz Ghoga was actively involved in legal representation for the families of people killed in the 1996 Abu Salim prison massacre.
2011 Libyan civil war.
Ghoga was a member of the National Transitional Council created during the 2011 Libyan civil war and acts as its spokesperson. Ghoga has argued that the Council is working for a unified Libya, rather than letting rebel-controlled areas separate from areas controlled by Muammar Gaddafi; ""There is no such thing as a divided Libya"". 
On 27 February, he said that the Council was not seeking foreign intervention. On 20 March, he announced that over 8000 people opposed to Gaddafi had been killed. He criticised a comment by Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa that was critical of the way in which the Libyan no-fly zone was implemented. Ghoga stated, "Today, when the secretary general spoke, I was surprised. What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya, what is the mechanism, Mr. Secretary General? If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation, what is the mechanism that you propose to us?"
Resignation.
In January 2012, he resigned as Vice Chairman of the Transitional National Council.

Cyanea remyi

Cyanea remyi is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name Remy's cyanea. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Kauai. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea", it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This plant was very poorly known before 1987, with only two specimens ever having been collected, and no more occurrences of the plant seen since 1916. Then, in 1987, the species was rediscovered when a population of up to 50 plants was found next to the Wailua River. This population was decimated by Hurricane Iniki in 1992, leaving few plants alive. In 2000, eight plants were observed, and in 2006 only a single individual remained. In the meantime other small populations were found, but several have since been destroyed in events such as flash floods. A 2010 report estimated as few as 24 individuals divided among three populations.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub growing up to 2 meters tall and appearing superficially palm-like. The inflorescence bears up to 13 deep purple flowers. It grows in wet forest habitat in the understory of "ʻōhiʻa lehua" ("Metrosideros polymorpha"), "ohe mauka" ("Tetraplasandra" spp.), and ʻōlapa ("Cheirodendron" spp.). The understory is thick with ferns, other "Cyanea" species, and many other species of Hawaiian endemic flora.
The habitat is threatened with degradation and destruction by a number of forces, especially feral pigs and exotic plant species such as Chinese ground orchid ("Phaius tancarvilleae") and Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta").

Bazna (pig)

The Bazna, also known as the Basner and Porcul de Banat, is a breed of domestic pig that started to develop in 1872 from crosses between the Mangalitsa and Berkshire breeds. The breed became officially recognized in 1958. Bazna pigs are found in the central area of the Transylvania region of Romania and are colored black with a white belt.
History.
The development of the Bazna breed started in 1872 from crosses between the Mangalitsa and Berkshire breeds. As the breed formed and developed, the Berkshire, Yorkshire, Angler Sattelschwein, Wessex, and Hampshire breeds were all used to help homogenize and better it. The Berkshire pigs that were used for this purpose came from England in 1885, and again after 1900.
The Bazna breed was officially recognized in 1958.
Upon formation, the breed was distributed to several towns in the Transylvania region of Romania: Mediaș, Sibiu and Făgăraș. After World War II, the breed was distributed further around the Transylvania region, and also to Banat.

La Vijanera

La Vijanera is a fiesta of festive nature that takes place in the town of Silió (Molledo), Cantabria (Spain) on the first Sunday of each year. Due to its popularity and tradition has been declared as Fiesta of National Tourist Interest.
The fiesta.
Originally, La Vijanera was celebrated in the valleys of Iguña, Toranzo, Trasmiera, Campoo and Polaciones but now the only place in the region where it is just Silió. The first carnival of the year in Europe is a colorful masquerade involving approximately 60 characters (all male), "la madama", "el mancebo", "los trapajones", "el oso" and "su dueño", "el pasiego", "el caballero", "la Pepa" or "Pepona", "el médico", "el domador", "el húngaro", "el viejo" and "la vieja", all dressed in a colorful and own function and symbolism.
But the real stars of the festival are los zarramacos because of the importance of their role. These are people dressed in sheepskins and weevils hats in addition to carrying the face painted black that will ward off the evil spirits during the year that jingling bells that are tied to the body. Its mission is to expel these spirits of the town coming up to the limits, tradition that points to much more ancient probably from the Roman times.
The second part of the celebration is to review the year end. The Vijaneros waiters gather at the town square and read some verses that, in popular language and tones ranging from jocularity to the cruelty, analyze what happened in the past year from local to international.
The fiesta ends with two acts, first produced "la Preñá", ie the calve or birth of the new year. After that, La Vijanera concludes with the death of the Bear, which symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the desire of good intentions for the new year.
As can be seen in this fiesta represents the desire to banish the last year and pave the way to the next year to begin with enthusiasm and good wishes. Perhaps because of this that the Roman god Janus is responsible for chairing La Vijanera. In fact, "Janus" in Latin derives from "Jauna", ie gate, so it may want to mean "gate between two years" if it consider the prefix vi-("bi"-, two).
As an incentive to the celebration itself, in recent editions has established a photography prize. On the other hand, are plans to build a Museum about the holiday in Silió, among other things contain images of the party. Both initiatives have been promoted by the Asociación de Amigos de la Vijanera, head of the organization and retrieval of this event for more than 25 years after his disappearance during the Franco dictatorship.

<doc id="31030642" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31030642" title="Multifocal motor neuropathy">
Multifocal motor neuropathy

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a progressively worsening condition where muscles in the extremities gradually weaken. The disorder, a pure motor neuropathy syndrome, is sometimes mistaken for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because of the similarity in the clinical picture, especially if muscle fasciculations are present. Unlike ALS, MMN is usually asymmetric. MMN is thought to be autoimmune. It was first described in the mid-1980s.
Unlike ALS which affects both upper and lower motor nerves, MMN involves only lower motor nerves. Nevertheless, definitive diagnosis is often difficult, and many MMN patients labor for months or years under an ALS diagnosis before finally getting a determination of MMN.
MMN usually involves very little pain however muscle cramps, spasms and twitches can often cause much pain for some sufferers. MMN is rarely fatal, but can lead to significant disability, with loss of function in hands affecting ability to work and perform everyday tasks, and "foot drop" leading to inability to stand and walk; many patients end up using aids like canes, splints and walkers.
Symptoms.
Usually beginning in one or both hands, MMN is characterized by weakness, muscle atrophy, cramping, and often profuse fasciculations (muscle twitching). The symptoms are progressive, often in a stepwise fashion, but unlike ALS are often treatable.
Sensory nerves are usually unaffected.
Wrist drop and foot drop (leading to difficulty walking) are common symptoms. Other effects can include gradual loss of finger extension, leading to a clawlike appearance. Cold & hot temperatures exacerbates MMN symptoms to such an extent, unlike other neuropathies, that it is being investigated as a diagnostic tool.
Treatment.
Although no treatment is required in some cases, multifocal motor neuropathy is normally treated by receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Steroid treatment (prednisone) and plasmapheresis are no longer considered to be useful treatments; prednisone can exacerbate symptoms. IVIg is the primary treatment, with about 80% of patients responding, usually requiring regular infusions at intervals of 1 week to several months. Other treatments are considered in case of lack of response to IVIg, or sometimes because of the high cost of immunoglobulin. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin is under study as a less invasive, more-convenient alternative to IV delivery.

C.W. Smith

C. W. Smith (born 1940) is a novelist, short-story and essay writer who serves as a Dedman Family Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at Southern Methodist University.
Early life.
C. W. Smith (full name Charles William Smith) was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and grew up in Hobbs, New Mexico. He received a B.A. in English from the University of North Texas in 1964 and an M.A. in English from Northern Illinois University in 1967. After teaching at Southwest Missouri State University, he moved to Mexico for a year to work on his first novel, "Thin Men of Haddam". Published by Viking/Grossman in 1973, the book won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters for the Best Novel by a Texan or about Texas and was recognized by the Southwestern Library Association for making a “distinguished contribution to an understanding of a vital social issue in the American Southwest.” .”
Career.
Smith has said that his goal since beginning his first novel has been “to document in a dramatic fashion the cultural conflicts of the American Southwest as well as the universal, existential dilemmas that arise from being human regardless of place and time.” In pursuit of that goal, his second novel, set in West Texas among oil field workers and small-town citizens, sought to portray the lives of young people trapped in circumstances too small for their aspirations. That novel, Country Music (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1975), was optioned by Playboy Productions. The novel was reviewed widely with largely, though not universally, positive notices: "Smith's portrait of a troubled young man searching for himself he knows not where...is alive, funny, sad, and as real as it can be." "The characters are convincing. The pace is unusually fast for a psychological novel. Smith is a writer of growing importance." "C.W. Smith’s technique has the impact of that of Claude Simon, the Provencal farmer-novelist who creates arresting amalgams of past, present, reverie and locale. Can’t do much better than that. "The New Yorker", on the other hand, posted that “This novel is easy to enjoy on a cartoon level, but only on that level…”
Largely on the strength of the two novels, Smith was awarded a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship at the University of Texas, where he spent a year working on short stories. He was then hired to adapt the novel to the screen and spend time in Los Angeles working with producers on a script while his family resettled in Indianapolis. When the family returned to Texas, Smith became a reporter and film critic for "The Dallas Times-Herald" and subsequently began teaching at Southern Methodist University. His third novel, "The Vestal Virgin Room" (Atheneum, 1983), focused on a pair of married itinerant musicians, Mid-Westerners, whose efforts to secure fame in Las Vegas results in a strain in a marriage already under stress due to the loss of their only child. The novel has been optioned by three different producers with three different scripts, one by playwright Jonathan Tolins (“The Twilight of the Golds”), and the latest by producer Ed Bates with a screenplay by playwright and screenwriter David Dean Bottrell (“Dearly Departed”).
Smith then embarked upon a long historical novel based loosely upon the life of an Osage who was called in the press in the 1920s and 1930s “the world’s richest Indian.” "Buffalo Nickel" was published in 1989 by Simon & Schuster after nearly a decade of writing and revision. "The destruction of native American cultures might be considered by some readers to be a literary dry hole. But this novel, about a Kiowa man who inadvertently becomes an Oklahoma oil millionaire, is a rich gusher of a novel - and consequently disproves any such notions….This is a big novel, in all senses - the characters and the incidents of their lives made memorably real." "Critic Bruce Allen, writing in USA Today, said that “Buffalo Nickel is a delightful rarity: an old-fashioned ‘good read’ which tells the life story of a likable and interesting character who truly grows and changes...The novel is a roomy, agreeably slow-paced picaresque whose serious themes (the abrading of Indian culture, the gradual disappearance of space and wilderness) emerge with haunting clarity from a prose that continuously suggests and dramatizes, never once breaking into sermon. "Buffalo Nickel" may well be the year's best novel.."
During the 1980s and 1990s, Smith wrote non-fiction as well as novels and short stories. He was, briefly, the ethics columnist for "Esquire" and the film critic for "Texas Monthly". As a freelance journalist and essayist, his work appeared in magazines and periodicals both scholarly and commercial. A cover article entitled “Uncle Dad” published by "Esquire" became a full-length memoir about his efforts to remain a part of his children’s lives after a divorce. The book, commissioned and published by Putnam, was also released under the author’s original title in a subsequent paperback edition by Berkley. His nonfiction work has been recognized through various awards: Special Merit Award for Feature Writing from the Penney-Missouri Foundation; the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism from the Texas Institute of Letters, and the award for Best Nonfiction Book by a Texan in 1987 from the Southwestern Booksellers Association.
In 1994, Texas Christian University Press began its long association with Smith’s works through the publication of his short-story collection, "Letters From the Horse Latitudes". Most of the stories in the collection were previously published, and his short fiction has appeared in "Mademoiselle, Vision, Southwest Review, Sunstone Review, Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Humanities Review, Quartet, Cimarron Review, American Literary Review, American Short Fiction," "The Missouri Review," and "descant". Writing about the collection in "The New York Times", Benjamin Cheever said, ”Set in Mexico and the American Southwest, Mr. Smith's stories have a rugged informality. Their sense of intimacy is so great that the reader feels he has uncovered a cache of personal letters or is overhearing a late-night conversation between friends. And yet, like the stories of O. Henry, each is cleverly contrived to capture some essence of life and also to make a point. Today most O. Henry stories read like antiques, dependent for their effects on credulous readers and illuminated with false optimism. But the world that Mr. Smith dramatizes is both contemporary and convincing." .” His stories have received the Frank O'Connor Memorial Short Story Award from "Quartet;" the John H. McGinnis Short Story Award from "Southwest Review", as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. An excerpt from his story “The Plantation Club” was included in, “Seeing Jazz: Artists and Writers on Jazz,” published by Chronicle Books in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (1997). His short story, “The Bundelays,” was performed by Judith Ivey as part of the Dallas Museum of Arts’ “Arts and Letters Live Series,” as well as at sister programs in Denver and Houston.
Smith’s next novel, "Hunter’s Trap" (TCU Press, 1996), was designed to be an oblique sequel to the earlier Buffalo Nickel and the second part of a projected trilogy treating the theme of Native American assimilation into Anglo-European culture after the defeat of the Plains tribes by the U.S. military in the last quarter of the 19th century. “Somewhat reminiscent of the stories of Jim Harrison…Smith's novel offers an evocative exploration of the values and character of a time, a place, and a man. It's also a novel that would grace the lists of fine trade publishers, but refreshingly, it comes to us from a university press. Here's hoping that many readers come to know this skillfully wrought tale and that its success encourages TCU Press to bring us more such books." (Booklist) "It's an eye for an eye - obsessive hatred, relentless pursuit and coldblooded revenge for irrevocable loss - in this hypnotic sequel to Smith's highly-praised western, Buffalo Nickel...The plot...moves inexorably to a stunning irony on the final page." ." "Beautifully bitter Depression-era revenge melodrama in which good guys lose, good women die, and virtue's reward is unreasonable tragedy." 
Smith returned to more contemporary settings in his subsequent novel, "Understanding Women" (TCU Press, 1998), a coming-of-age story that takes place in the late 1950s when its sixteen-year-old protagonist and narrator leaves his home in Dallas to spend a summer working for his uncle in the oil fields. The novel won the Jesse H. Jones Award from the Texas Institute of Letters from the Best Novel of 1998 by a Texan or about Texas and also received an award from the Border Regional Library Association as an “Outstanding Book About the Southwest,” and the book garnered a starred review in Booklist.
"Gabriel's Eye" (Winedale Publishing, 2001) utilizes Smith’s intimate knowledge of contemporary Dallas to focus upon the affair between a female teacher and her student at a local performing arts high school. While the book did secure mild praise from a reviewer in "Publisher’s Weekly", it went largely unnoticed in the press, although the Austin Chronicle gave it a full-length, somewhat mixed review. .
Smith once again embarked upon unearthing historical records to produce a lengthy tome based on the riots of 1943 in Beaumont, Texas, when war-time social and living conditions produced racial tension that flared into violent civil disorder when an African-American was falsely accused of raping the wife of an overseas sailor. The book, Purple Hearts (TCU Press, 2008) took seven years to write and went through thirteen drafts to reach its final form. Again, as was the case with his previous novel, the work went unnoticed, though scholar and critic Clay Reynolds has written fully of it. (See below.) The novel was a 2009 finalist for Best Novel award given by the Writers’ League of Texas. HIs short story "Caustic" (Southwest Review, Summer 2010) was given The Kay Catarulla Award for "best short story of 2010" by The Texas Institute of Letters.
Smith’s most recent novel, Steplings, was published in September 2011 by TCU Press. The novel is a coming-of-age story for a young man from a Dallas blue-collar suburb who allows his eleven-year-old stepsister to run away with him, setting off an Amber Alert that divides their newly married parents. Early reviews ran from mixed to very positive: “Slow, a little weak in the plot department, but rich in psychological insight and lit by occasional flashes of humor”; the two characters “make page-turning strides toward responsibility and maturity as they learn what an awesome task it is to take responsibility for each other";“Texas novelist C.W. Smith has received just about every literary award the state and region bestow, and his latest work, the sprightly and wise Steplings, will no doubt add to his reputation as a Lone Star star…. Steplings comes to a completely realistic, bittersweet conclusion that will disappoint readers who like their endings tied in neat bows. But Smith is no fantasist — he’s a writer who can be depended on to write life as he actually sees it, not as he (or we) might wish it were”; “Even though these kinds of relationship dynamics have been mined many times before, Smith's story rings true and never feels stale. A dash of international politics spices up the personal politics of Steplings in a way that isn't forced or incongruent. The only misstep is a brief glimpse into the life of Jason's girlfriend that reads like a long parenthetical to the real story – a story of bonds between siblings and spouses, parents and children, and the fallout when they pull in different directions”.
In addition to the awards described above, Smith has twice received Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. In April 2011 he was given The Lon Tinkle Award for "sustained excellence in a career" by the Texas Institute of Letters. He belongs to PEN, The Authors Guild, Writer's Guild of America West, and the Texas Institute of Letters.

God of Love (film)

God of Love is an American live action short film. The film's run time is approximately 18 minutes. It was written and directed by Luke Matheny, and produced by Gigi Dement, Ryan Silbert, and Stefanie Walmsley. The film was shot in black and white on the Red One camera by director of photography Bobby Webster.
In the film, a lounge singer and championship dart player named Raymond Goodfellow is desperately in love with a fellow band-mate, but she only has love for his best friend. The crooner prays daily to God for a way for his beloved to fall in love with him. One evening, his prayers are answered when he's given a box of magical darts with Cupid-like powers. Raymond decides to use the darts to make his own love connection.
The film is included as a special feature in the Blu-ray release of "127 Hours".
Plot.
Raymand Goodfellow rides on a country road on his motor scooter. His voice over explains “You can’t control who you fall in love with, or who falls in love with you. Love doesn’t make sense.”
The film flashes back to three months earlier to Ray’s time as a confident, self-centered lounge singer/dart thrower. Ray’s band consists of his friends Fozzie (guitar), Frank (stand-up bass) and the “love of his life” Kelly (drums). Before he joins the band onstage, Ray prays to God asking him for assistance in getting Kelly to love him. Despite Ray’s ongoing affection to her, she seems drawn to Fozzie who, claiming he's genuinely uninterested, is rejecting Kelly’s advances. 
After Ray’s crowd pleasing performance, he is informed by the bartender that someone has left a package for him. The package contains “love darts.” The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see. This attraction lasts for 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won’t. 
Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run. While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy Jersey Girl named Angela. The first man she sees is Ray’s quiet, low-key bandmate Frank. Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately. Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around. After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts “effective.”
Ray enlists Fozzie’s help in creating the “most romantic six hours” ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart’s initial power ends. Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her.
Ray goes to Kelly’s house and strikes her with a dart. As promised by the dart’s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him. They go on their date which goes perfectly. Towards the end of the six hours they kiss. When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves. It is clear that the love from the dart did not last.
Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women (and one man) who are completely in love with him for six hours. During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again. He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again.
The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time. Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly. Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him. Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly. The two instantly fall in love with each other.
A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment. He finds another mysterious box outside his apartment with a note that says “nice work.” He opens the box and finds Cupid’s bow and arrow.
The film flashes forward to three months in the future at the point the film began. The band continues but without Ray; Angela is the new singer. Frank & Angela and Fozzie & Kelly are still very much in love. Ray is many miles away driving on his motor scooter on the country road his bow and arrow tied to his back. He repeats “you can’t control who you love, or who loves you.” He ends by saying that love doesn’t make sense. He knows all this because “I am the God of Love.”
Awards.
Matheny won the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film at the 83rd Academy Awards for God of Love. Upon receiving the award, the 34 year-old New York University, Tisch School of the Arts student thanked his mother and told the audience, "Oh, I should have got a haircut!". Matheny also thanked the Filipino-Americans who helped him in the production of the movie.

Amandla Development

Amandla Development is a South Africa based NGO focused on empowering South African youth with equal access to education opportunities. Amandla means "power". Founded in 2009, Amandla Development builds capacity by working in education and collaborating with other NGOs and schools.
History.
The organization was founded by Scott Clarke, a Jamaican-American who attended Yale and NYU.
Amandla was founded in 2009 in response to the need in South Africa for local capacity development ensuring that populations previously oppressed by apartheid have the opportunity to participate in the growing economy on equal footing. Because apartheid systematically broke down family and community structures, there is little sense that communities outside of the more developed cities can create opportunity. Thus Amandla began with the question of “how can we develop internal capacity for these communities to create opportunity?” Amandla soon zeroed in on education as a major driver of opportunity and began this chapter of its work in early 2011. Prior to that the focus was on creating a model of capacity development that could bring community actors together to multiply their impact. Amandla was developing and experimenting with this model with MAGI (Multi-Agency Grants Initiative) until early 2011. Joining the impact multiplication concept with school improvement is Amandla’s niche.
Core values.
Its core values are based on Equipping, Empowering, and helping youth Excel.
Projects.
Amandla Development takes a holistic approach to developing capacity in communities to drive opportunity. As such, Amandla Development supports inclusive approaches that embrace the multiple levels on which complex social issues must be tackled.
Amandla works with important community actors to improve the support network for youth both in and out of school. Currently, Amandla is engaging stakeholders in the Philippi, Cape Town area.

The Left Shoe Company

The Left Shoe Company, previously Left Foot Company, is a made-to-measure male footwear manufacturer with offices in London, United Kingdom and in Helsinki, Finland. The company was founded in 1998 as The Left Foot Company. It was renamed and rebranded The Left Shoe Company in the fall of 2010.
Business model.
Because of the Made to measure 3D scanning method the shoes are available in a wide range of sizes and more personalized models. Normally, tailor made high quality shoes come at a high price, the delivery is around six months and the customer must revisit the shoemaker frequently. In contrast, 3-D measured shoes can be delivered in 4 weeks.
The company – or its retailers – does not carry any inventory or overhead. This puts The Left Shoe Company in the same retail market as regular Ready-to-wear shoes with the exception that they are made-to-measure
Once the 3D-scanning process is completed, the costumer is able to individualize his choice of shoes in accordance with the made-to-measure term, both in the store and on the website he can choose the sole, colour and leather to his liking.
The Left Shoe Company received recognition from management guru C. K. Prahalad in his book The New Age of Innovation.

Khamis Gaddafi

Khamis Gaddafi (27 May 1983 – 29 August 2011) was the seventh and youngest son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and the military commander in charge of the Khamis Brigade of the Libyan Army. He was part of his father's inner circle. During the Libyan civil war in 2011, he was a major target for opposition forces trying to overthrow his father.
Education and career.
At age three, Khamis Gaddafi was injured in the 15 April 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, suffering head injuries when the Bab al-Azizia military compound was attacked in retaliation for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing. He graduated from the military academy in Tripoli, receiving a bachelor's degree in military arts and science, further graduating from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow and the Academy of the General Staff Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. In 2008, Gaddafi visited Algeria, where he was received by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
In April 2010, he began a master's degree at the IE Business School (formerly known as Instituto de Empresa), in Madrid. However, he was expelled by the institution in March 2011 for "his links to the attacks against the Libyan population".
In early 2011, Gaddafi worked as an intern at AECOM Technology Corporation. According to Paul Gennaro, AECOM's Senior Vice President for Global Communications, Gaddafi was touring the United States in February 2011 as part of his internship, including visiting military sites and landmarks. This trip was cut short on 17 February after the Libyan civil war began, and Gaddafi returned to Libya. U.S. government officials later denied any role in planning, advising or paying for the trip.
Role in the Libyan civil war.
After hurrying back to Libya to aid his father in the civil war, Khamis Gaddafi commanded the assault on Zawiya, leading the Khamis Brigade, a special forces brigade of the Libyan Armed Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. The battle resulted in pro-Gaddafi forces retaking the city. He also assisted in suppressing anti-regime demonstrations in and around the capital Tripoli in late February-early March. His forces also took part in the Battle of Misrata. In June 2011, he was reported to be commanding pro-Gaddafi forces in Zliten by a soldier captured from his brigade who also reported that Khamis Gaddafi had told his troops to "take Misrata or I will kill you myself. If you don’t take Misrata, we are finished."
Rumors of death.
Libyan civil war.
13 March 2011: Alleged suicide attack on Bab al-Azizia.
On 20 March 2011, it was reported by the anti-Gaddafi Al Manara Media that Khamis Gaddafi had died from injuries sustained when pilot Muhammad Mokhtar Osman allegedly crashed his plane into Bab al-Azizia a week earlier. This was not confirmed by any independent news source. The crashing of the plane itself had also not been previously reported or confirmed by any other independent media except Al Manara and the Algerian "Shuruk" newspaper, which is closely connected to Al Manara, and with it there is a possibility of the reports being part of the propaganda operations by the opposition.
The pro-Gaddafi Libyan government subsequently denied that he was killed on 21 March. U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton stated that she was aware of reports that one of Gaddafi's sons had been killed in non-coalition air strikes, after hearing them from "many different sources", but that the "evidence is not sufficient" for her to confirm this. On 25 March 2011, Al Arabiya television reported that a source had confirmed the death of Khamis Gaddafi, though others including Al Jazeera continued to call it a rumour.
On 29 March 2011, the Libyan government showed footage of what it said was live footage of Khamis Gaddafi greeting supporters in Tripoli, in an attempt to refute the claims, though it had used false live images before and these images were not verified. On 9 June 2011, a captured pro-Gaddafi soldier in Misrata told the rebels that Khamis Gaddafi was alive in Zliten, and was leading the soldiers there.
5 August 2011: Airstrike in Zliten.
On 5 August 2011, citing spies operating among the ranks of forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, Mohammed Zawawi, a spokesman for the United Revolutionary Forces, told the Agence France Press news agency that Khamis Gaddafi had been killed overnight, stating that "there was a aircraft attack by NATO on the Gaddafi operations room in Zliten and there are around 32 Gaddafi troops killed. One of them is Khamis."
This report was officially denied by Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim. "It's false news. They invented the news about Mr. Khamis Gaddafi in Zliten to cover up their killing," Ibrahim told Reuters in Tripoli. "This is a dirty trick to cover up their crime in Zliten and the killing of the al-Marabit family." NATO was also unable to confirm the reports of Khamis's death. On 9 August, a man who appeared to be Khamis Gaddafi was on Libyan state television speaking to a woman who had allegedly been severely injured by a NATO airstrike.
22 August 2011: Reports of bodies in Tripoli.
On 22 August, Al Jazeera reported that the bodies of both Khamis Gaddafi and his father's intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi may have been discovered in Tripoli during the battle for the city. However, a rebel commander later stated that he believed Khamis Gaddafi was in Bab al-Azizia.
Senussi was found alive and captured in Mauritania on 17 March 2012, and was extradited to Libya on 5 September for trial.
29 August 2011: Airstrike near Tarhuna.
On 29 August, it was reported that anti-Gaddafi fighters 60 km south of Tripoli claimed that a NATO Apache helicopter had fired on Khamis Gaddafi's Toyota Land Cruiser, destroying the vehicle. A man who claimed to be Khamis Gaddafi's bodyguard said he had been killed. No visual confirmation was immediately available. Several days later, "The Guardian" interviewed a former guard being held captive in Tarhuna. His personal guard, Abdul Salam Taher Fagri, a 17 year old from Sabha, recruited in Tripoli, later confirmed that Khamis Gaddafi was indeed killed in this attack. He told the newspaper "I was in the truck behind him ... when his car was hit. He was burned." Three other guards being held in separate cells apparently gave similar accounts, leading their captors to believe the accounts of all four to be credible. Some accounts of the attack that reportedly killed Gaddafi suggested fire from a technical, rather than a helicopter, destroyed his vehicle.
The National Transitional Council claimed on 4 September that it was now certain Khamis Gaddafi was dead and had been buried near Bani Walid. In mid-September 2011, a report stated that Gaddafi was in Bani Walid, but had left the city and his men to their fate. However, the "International Business Times" reported on 15 September that Khamis Gaddafi was still presumed dead. On 15 October, the Syrian-based pro-Gaddafi TV station Arrai TV posted a message mourning his death on 29 August.
After the war.
At least one report published after the capture of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi asserted that the older Gaddafi told interrogators that Khamis Gaddafi was still alive and may be hiding in Tarhuna. On 25 February 2012, "Stratfor" reported the capture of Khamis Gaddafi by fighters from Zintan. This was denied by the NTC.
In April 2012, "New York Times" journalist Robert Worth met with former Tripoli Yarmouk prison captor Marwan Gdoura, who confessed that after the execution of around 100 prisoners he fled the city with some 200 loyalists under the command of Khamis Gaddafi, who was killed in gunbattle. Afterwards, he witnessed his older brother Saif al-Islam Gaddafi receiving condolences in Bani Walid.
20 October 2012: Siege of Bani Walid.
For over a year, it was believed that Khamis died on August 2011. On 17 October 2012, a report from Human Rights Watch said "Khamis Gaddafi, a son of Muammar who commanded the elite 32nd "Khamis" Brigade of the Libyan military, was killed on 29 August as he fled Tripoli, in what is believed to have been a NATO airstrike on his convoy. However, just three days later, Khamis Gaddafi was allegedly killed according to the new Libyan deputy Prime Minister's tweet during fighting in the town of Bani Walid on 20 October 2012, a year to the day Gaddafi's father Muammar was captured and killed by rebel forces in Sirte. A statement from the Libyan National Congress's spokesman, Omar Hamdan, claimed Gaddafi was killed "in battle", but gave no further details. His body was allegedly found after a day of heavy fighting between the town's pro-Gaddafi garrison and militias allied to the Libyan government.
A government spokesman denied that there was any official confirmation about the capture of Mussa Ibrahim to Agence France-Presse, and did not even talk about the rumor of Khamis Gaddafi's death. The Associated Press described the report of Gaddafi's death as an unconfirmed rumor. Musa Ibrahim, the former spokesman of Muammar Gaddafi, personally disproved the message on the arrest saying he was not even in Libya and denied the most recent reports on the death of Khamis. On 24 October 2012, government spokesman Nasser Al-Manaa retracted and apologised for false reports from the government and the National Congress regarding the killing of Khamis Gaddafi and the capture of Moussa Ibrahim.
On March 7, 2014, while reporting about the capture of Khamis' older brother Al-Saadi Gaddafi, "Daily Telegraph" journalist Robert Spencer repeated earlier claims that Khamis was killed while trying to flee the vicinity of Tripoli in 2011.

<doc id="31030823" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31030823" title="Mehek language">
Mehek language

Mehek is a Tama language spoken by about 6300 people in a somewhat mountainous area along the southern base of the Torricelli Mountains in northwestern Papua New Guinea. Mehek is spoken in six villages of Sandaun Province: Nuku, Yiminum, Mansuku, Yifkindu, Wilwil, and Kafle. Mehek is most closely related to Pahi, with 51% lexical similarity, and spoken approximately 20 kilometers to the southwest. Mehek is a fairly typical Papuan language, being verb-final, having a relatively simple phonology, and agglutinative morphology. There is very little published information about Mehek. The literacy rate in Tok Pisin, spoken by nearly everyone, is 50-75%. Mehek is not written, so there is no literacy in Mehek. Tok Pisin is primarily used in the schools, with 50% children attending.
Alternate Names.
Mehek is also known as Nuku, Me’ek, Driafleisuma, and Indinogosima The speakers themselves refer to the language as Mehek, which is the word meaning “no.” The alternate names derive from the primary village where it is spoken (Nuku), a phonological variant: epenthetic /h/ occurs word-initially before vowels or between identical vowels (Me’ek), and a phrase meaning “our language” (indinumgo suma).
Phonology.
The phonology of Mehek is relatively simple. It has a five-vowel system, much like many of the non-Austronesian languages of Papua New Guinea, in addition to two diphthongs. The consonant system is also fairly simple, containing 15 phonemes. Voiced stops are almost always prenasalized, though this effect is much weaker word-initially. The tables below list the consonant and vowel phonemes. In the list of vowels, the phones in parentheses are allophones.
Morphology.
Mehek is an agglutinating language with both prefixes and suffixes.
Verbs.
Mehek has medial and final verbs, only the latter of which take any morphological marking. In a given utterance, there can be any number of medial verb forms. They must precede the final verb and have the same subject as the final verb. Whenever a new subject is introduced, a new final verb form must be used (with a possible string of medial verbs preceding it). There are two past and two future tenses. The Recent Past and the Near Future apply to yesterday and tomorrow, respectively. The Distant Past and Distant Future are used for any day before yesterday or after tomorrow, respectively. The formula for a final verb is: stem+tense+person+interrogative. The interrogative marker is optional and consists of a suffix –a on the end of any verb form. The other suffixes are as follows:
Nouns.
Nominal morphology is fairly straightforward, each noun only taking a single suffix. Nouns can also appear in their base form. Every noun is specified for gender, masculine or feminine, though the respective gender affix is not obligatory. Living things have natural gender, while plants and inanimate objects have morphological gender. There are five possible affixes a singular noun can take. Nouns in the dual or plural can only be marked for number, and these affixes are obligatory where appropriate.
Pronouns.
Mehek pronouns occur in singular, dual and plural number and have different subject and object forms. Mehek also has a series of imperative pronouns which are distinct in the 1st and 3rd persons and are used in commands and suggestions (let’s...).
Possession.
Possession is indicated by the morpheme -ko-/-go-. This morpheme takes a prefix that agrees with the possessor in person and number and a suffix that agrees with the possessed in number only. (Gender agreement does occur in both, but only for 3rd person singular entities.) The prefixes are virtually identical to the verbal person suffixes, and the suffixes are identical to the noun suffixes.
Numerals.
The counting system is a restricted system, with only three morphemes combining in different ways to count as high as 24. In practice, though, any number above five will be given in Tok Pisin and numbers above ten are difficult for speakers to recall. The morpheme for “five” is related to the word for “fist.” Numbers above five are combinations of lower numbers up to 15, when a new term is introduced which can then be used for combinations up to 24. This term is related to the word for fist, but with the morpheme for “foot” (suwa) replacing the morpheme for “hand” (lesu). As an example of how the morphemes are combined, 14 is rendered as “5,” “5,” “4.”
Syntax.
The following are some brief facts about Mehek syntax and word order:

Ugandan Sign Language

Ugandan Sign Language (USL) is the deaf sign language of Uganda. Uganda was the second country in the world to recognize sign language in its constitution, in 1995. A "Ugandan Sign Language Dictionary" has been published. However, knowledge of USL is primarily urban, as access to education for the rural deaf remains poor. Nonetheless, USL is a highly valued element of group identity among the deaf community. 
The first Ugandan schools for the deaf opened in 1962, and several sign languages are reported to have merged in 1988, when sign was allowed in the classroom. This suggests that USL may be a creole of the local languages that the deaf students created informally in the different schools. There were also influences from ASL, BSL, and Kenyan Sign Language, the first two from the language of instruction in early classrooms, and the latter from deaf Ugandans who went to Kenya for higher education. 
Both the British two-handed manual alphabet and the American manual alphabet are used, with minor modifications. Finger-spelling and initialized signs using both alphabets are common among people who learned USL formally as children. Mouthing is also common with abbreviated syllables from both English and Luganda.

Savva Chevakinsky

Savva Ivanovich Chevakinsky () (1709 – aft. 1774) was a Russian architect of the Baroque school. He worked in St. Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo.
Chevakinsky was born into a noble family in the village of Veshki in the Novotorzhsk district of Tver province. In 1729 he entered the Naval Academy in St. Petersburg, from whence he was assigned to the Izmaylovsky Life Guards Regiment in 1734. At the request of the Admiralty board he was discharged for unauthorized absence from the Academy and apprenticed to the architectural company of Ivan Korobov, under whose direction he worked for seven years.
In 1739 Chevakinsky began his independent career. From 1741 to 1767 he was chief architect for the Admiralty Board. From 1745 to 1760 he was an architect at Tsarskoe Selo, supervising the reconstruction of the palace and surrounding park. Here Chevakinsky erected two buildings (a church and a hall) connected by galleries to the central part of the palace, erected the "Monbizhu" pavilion (which housed palace officials), and participated in the creation of the "Hermitage" pavilion".
Chevakinsky's largest building in St. Petersburg was the St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral (1753–1762) with a separate tiered bell tower (1756–1758). He also rebuilt the Kunstkamera, the museum of anthropology and ethnography established by Peter the Great.
Chevakinsky also designed large private homes. For the Sheremetev family, he built the Fountain House (1750–1755) on the Fontanka Embankment, which building now houses the Anna Akhmatova Literary and Memorial Museum. For the Shuvalov family, he built a mansion at the corner of Malaya Sadovaya Street and Italyanskaya Street (1749–1756, rebuilt in the 19th century), which building later housed the Imperial Ministry of Justice (1802 to 1917) and is today home to the Museum of Hygiene.
From 1755 to 1758 Chevakinsky was an architect for the Imperial Academy of Sciences. During those years he taught Vasili Bazhenov and Ivan Starov.
According to some sources, Chevakinsky died between 1774 and 1780; according to other sources, he died in 1783.

Mouthing

In sign language, mouthing is the production of visual syllables with the mouth while signing. Although not present in all sign languages, and sometimes not in signers at all levels of education, where it does occur it may be an essential (that is, phonemic) element of a sign, distinguishing signs which would otherwise be homophones; in other cases a sign may seen to be flat and incomplete without mouthing even if it is unambiguous.
Mouthing often originates from oralist education, where sign and speech are used together. Thus mouthing may preserve an often abbreviated rendition of the spoken translation of a sign. In educated Ugandan Sign Language, for example, where both English and Ganda are influential, the word for , Av", is accompanied by the mouthed syllable "nyo", from Ganda "nnyo" 'very', and , jO*v", is accompanied by "vu", from Ganda "onvuma". Similarly, the USL sign , t55bf, is mouthed "fsh", an abbreviation of English "finish", and , }HxU, is mouthed "df". 
However, mouthing may also be iconic, as in the word for (of food or drink) in ASL, UtCbf", where the mouthing suggests something hot in the mouth and does not correspond to the English word "hot".
Mouthing is an essential element of cued speech and simultaneous sign and speech, both for the direct instruction of oral language and to disambiguate cases where there is not a one-to-one correspondence between sign and speech. However, mouthing does not always reflect the corresponding spoken word; when signing 'thick' in Auslan, for example, the mouthing is equivalent to spoken "fahth".
In a 2008 edition of "Sign Language & Linguistics", there is a study that discusses similarities and differences in mouthing between three different European sign languages. It goes into detail about mouthings, adverbial mouth gestures, semantically empty mouth gestures, enacting mouth gestures, and whole face gestures.

Lawrence Rocks

The Lawrence Rocks are a group of two rocky islets, 6.8 ha and 1.5 ha in area, with an associated reef, 2.4 km south-east of Point Danger in western Victoria, Australia, and about 6 km south-east of the city of Portland. Geologically, the group is formed from the remnants of an extinct volcano, with the islets composed of basalt and tuff.
The islets were sighted by Lieutenant James Grant on 5 December 1800 from the survey brig HMS "Lady Nelson" and named
for Captain Effingham Lawrence, 
one of the Elder Brethren of Trinity House.
Fauna.
The rocks are protected as a nature reserve and are the site of a breeding colony of Australasian Gannets, the overspill from which led to the establishment of a sister colony at Point Danger. The group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA), because it supports over 10% of the world population of Australasian Gannets, being used by over 6000 birds. Other birds recorded on the rocks, and likely to breed there, include Little Penguins, Black-faced Cormorants, Crested Terns, Silver Gulls, Sooty Oystercatchers and small numbers of Cape Gannets. The rocks are also used as a haul-out site by Australian Fur Seals.

Newdigate-Reed House

The Newdigate-Reed House is a two-story log house built by the Newdigate family at the top of the hill near the Lexington-Maysville Turnpike. John Newdigate, a farmer, is listed as the landowner in 1854. Situated at the top of a steep hill leading out of Maysville, the house served as a convenient rest stop for merchants and wagon masters hauling goods from the docks at Maysville to points south.
Siding was applied to the log structure in the 1930s. The structure is asymmetrical with four windows on the upper story left side, one on the right side, and one to the right of the first floor entrance. The doorway with a one-story portico is slightly off-center. Stone chimneys on either end of the house are original.
The building was purchased by the Bierbower family in the late 19th century and sold to Stanley Forman Reed in 1910, Reed having just completed his law studies at at a number of Universities including Yale University, the University of Virginia, Columbia University and the University of Paris.
The future supreme court justice began the practice of law in Maysville in 1910 with the law firm of Worthington, Browning and Reed. Reed served as a Kentucky state representative between 1912 and 1916, sponsoring child labor and workman's compensation bills that were enacted in the face of significant opposition.
Although a Democrat, Reed was appointed by President Herbert Hoover to serve as general counsel of the Federal Farm Board in 1929. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Reed Solicitor General of the United States to defend the New Deal laws whose constitutionality had been challenged. Reed was successful in doing so. In 1938, Reed was nominated to fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy caused by the retirement of Justice George Sutherland. Reed was widely considered the best lawyer in government service and his nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.

Seminoe Dam

Seminoe Dam is a concrete thick-arch dam on the North Platte River in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The dam stores water for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation, and is owned and operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. It is the uppermost dam on the North Platte River and is located directly upstream from the Kortes Dam. It lies in a narrow, isolated canyon formed by the North Platte cutting through the Seminoe Mountains about northeast of Rawlins. The dam forms Seminoe Reservoir, which covers more than when full. Seminoe State Park is adjacent to the reservoir.
History.
This dam was first proposed in the 1930s as part of the Bureau of Reclamation's Kendrick Project, which would regulate the flow of the North Platte River in order to improve agriculture in the valleys surrounding Casper, Wyoming. Originally known as the Casper-Alcova Project, it was authorized by the National Industrial Recovery Act on June 16, 1933 in response to the Great Depression. The project was renamed the Kendrick Project on August 9, 1937 in honor of Wyoming politician John B. Kendrick.
In 1934, Winston Brothers Company and Associates won the construction contract of Seminoe Dam. Groundbreaking of the damsite was on February 20, 1936 with preliminary blasting and excavations. The diversion tunnel for the North Platte was completed on January 17, 1937 with one fatality, and by May of that year, a cofferdam was completed to a sufficient height to divert the river into the new channel. Concrete pouring began on January 19, 1938 and the last bucket was emptied on December 21, 1938; water storage began in April 2, 1939 when the outlet tunnels were closed. The dam's power station was finished and the entire project was declared operational on August 3, 1939. A total of two deaths and several serious injuries resulted from the construction, and a pair of active faults that cut across the canyon near the dam site had to be excavated and filled in.
When the project was first completed, it delivered water to just , but has progressed steadily, and by 1980 supplied irrigation water to in the Casper valley.
Recreation.
The Seminoe Reservoir is stocked with fish by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission, and is open to boating and fishing, although access to the shoreline is limited and sometimes difficult due to the lack of development and distance from major cities.

Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church (Mayville, Wisconsin)

The Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church is a church in Mayville, Wisconsin, United States, formed by German immigrants, who, in 1846, arrived in Wisconsin from Nahausen, Prussia. Immanuel is the second oldest congregation in the South Wisconsin District of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, and the oldest Lutheran congregation organized in Northeastern Dodge County.
The group officially organized as a congregation on May 24, 1847, with Pastor Geyer of Lebanon, Wisconsin, providing word and sacrament ministry. The congregation split – not long after its founding – on account of doctrinal controversy, and the two congregations (both retaining the name Immanuel) were distinguished from one another as the "lower church" and the "upper church" throughout much of their history. The lower church was also referred to as the "River Church" on account of its location on the banks of the Rock River, and the upper church was nicknamed the "Hochheim" congregation. The two congregations remained separate for 103 years. After the Hochheim church was twice destroyed by fire, the congregations amalgamated in 1957 at the "River Church" location.
Both congregations operated Christian Day Schools. The lower church founded in 1847, opened their dayschool in an official capacity in 1855. Immanuel Lutheran School, Mayville, Wisconsin has been in continual operation ever since.

Kepler-223

KOI-730 (KIC #10227020) is a G5V star with an extrasolar planetary system discovered by the Kepler mission. Preliminary studies indicate that the KOI-730 star system consists of 4 planets orbiting the star.
Unconfirmed planetary system.
An as-yet unconfirmed planetary system has been detected by the Kepler mission, containing four planet candidates. This system was initially believed to contain two co-orbital planets orbiting the star at approximately the same orbital distance every 9.8 days, with one permanently locked 60° behind the other in one of the two Trojan Lagrangian points. The two co-orbital planets were thought to be locked in mean motion resonances with the other two planets, creating an overall 6:4:4:3 resonance. This would have been the first known example of co-orbital planets.
However follow-up study of the system revealed that an alternative configuration, with the four planets having orbital periods in the ratio 8:6:4:3 is better supported by the data. This configuration does not contain co-orbital planets.
Fabrycky et al. give the radii as 1.8, 2.1, 2.8, and 2.4 Earth radii with orbital periods of 7.4, 9.8, 14.8, and 19.7 days, respectively.

Nanshan Temple () is a Buddhist temple located in the foothills of Mount Danxia (丹霞山) to the south of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China. It is one of the most important Chinese Buddhism temples on the Chinese mainland.
History.
Originally known as the Baoqu Institute (报劬院), the temple was built during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang during his "Kaiyuan" era (开元) and completed in 736 CE. In 968 CE during the reign of Emperor Taizu of Song it was repaired by the provincial governor Chen Wen (陈文) and renamed Chongfu Temple (崇福寺). Later on during the Ming Dynasty, its name changed once more to the current "Nanshan Temple".
Description.
Nanshan Temple is built in the typical style with the central axis divided into the Hall of the Four Heavenly Kings (天王殿), the Mahavira Hall (大雄宝殿) and a
the Monasterial Library for the storage of sacred Buddhist scriptures.

National RTI Awards

The National RTI Awards are annual, non-government awards to acknowledge those individuals in India who have "displayed exemplary commitment to the Right to Information Act". The awards have been instituted by Public Cause Research Foundation, and sponsored by NDTV, "Hindustan Times", "Dainik Jagran", and others. Some RTI activists who were killed receive posthumous awards.
The first RTI Awards were distributed at a ceremony held on 1 December 2009 in New Delhi and graced by the Honourable Vice President of India Hamid Ansari.
In its 2nd year (2010) the awards were renamed as PCRF-HT RTI awards. The scope of the six awards in four categories were altered to include "an Information Commissioner who enforced RTI Act strictly, two Public Information Officers who provided correct and complete information, and two citizens who used RTI and created public impact".
Categories.
At present the awards are awarded for 4 categories:
Winners.
The winners get a cash prize, a citation and a trophy. The cash prize was for year 2009 and 2010.
Winners for 2009.
2009 was the first year that these awards were conferred. The award ceremony was presided over by the Vice President of India M. Hamid Ansari who highlighted that the RTI Act had ""given a new meaning to citizen engagement with governance"". The following awards were conferred to the following performers in each category:
Winners for 2010.
The following winners were announced in December, 2010 for the year:
Special honours (for the killed).
Additionally, the Jury "specially honoured" the following 10 RTI activists who were killed while pursuing RTI activities:
The awards were presented in a ceremony in New Delhi on 20 January 2011.
Controversy.
The awards are not conferred by the Government, and India's RTI watchdog the Central Information Commission has decided not to accept awards from private groups for discharge of their duties.
The then Chief Information Commissioner of India Wajahat Habibullah blasted these "shamefully demeaning private awards" and said "We aren’t schoolkids, won’t accept demeaning RTI awards". Another Information Commissioner MM Ansari questioned the credentials of the activists behind the PCRF to grant these awards by categorizing them as an "eyewash".

Gustin House

The Gustin House is a municipal and provincial designated historic building located in the Nutana neighborhood of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The Trounce House, also a historic building, was relocated into the backyard of the Gustin House property in 1920. 
The Gustin House is a 1920s style residential home with a special piano studio that connects to the main living room in the by sliding glass doors, permitting the use of the combined space for performances. In 1928 a back extension was constructed permitting a second rear piano studio to be added,the first remaining in the living room at the front of the house inside the veranda, with a library between the rooms. Dr Gustin's summer-class students also used the piano in Grace-Westminster United Church across the street at the corner of Eastlake Avenue -- Westminster Church on 12th Street having closed in the mid-1960s.
Built for Dr Lyell Gustin (1895–1988), pianist and music teacher, the space was used to teach amateur and professional musicians over a period of 70 years. Between some 357 of the students taught by Lyell Gustin over 465 diplomas from Canadian and English music examining boards were awarded. 
In 1988, after the death of Lyell Gustin, the house was left to the University of Saskatchewan. Initially the university only intended to preserve the two Steinway pianos and portraits as a memorial, however the university was persuaded to sell the building and its other contents to one of his former students, Lloyd Rodwell, who donated the assets to the Gustin/Trounce Heritage Committee. 
The Committee now operates the home as an office to organize recitals in the city, while permitting it to be used to display artifacts of Lyell Gustin, for meeting space used by the local music community and hosting chamber music recitals.
Trounce House.
The Trounce House (1883) is the oldest known building in Saskatoon; one of a set of six originally built to house settlers from the Temperance Colonization Society. The home was built for John Conn, however he never lived in it. It was sold in 1884 to Harry and Bessie Trounce. In 1885 one of the three rooms was used as a retail store, making it the first retail establishment housed in a building within the city. The home was built from the first shipment of wood shipped to the Temperance Colonization Society that initially settled Saskatoon. In 1920 the building was moved from the front to the back of the current lot (permitting the Gustin House to be built in its place ) and converted into a garage.

Bruce Moon

Bruce L. Moon (born c. 1951) is an American Art therapist, educator, artist, and author. He is also a singer/songwriter who has recorded several albums. He is an Honorary Life Member (HLM) of the American Art Therapy Association (AATA), which is their most prestigious honor in the field of Art Therapy.
Education.
Bruce Moon attended high school in Sidney, Ohio. In June 1973, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Art Education from Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio where he first learned about the field of art therapy. He then worked at Harding Hospital in Worthington, Ohio, where he earned an AATA-approved Certificate of Clinical Internship in their Art Therapy Master's Equivalency program in March 1975. He attended Methodist Theological School in Delaware, Ohio, where he received a Master of Arts in Education in June 1976, and a Master of Divinity in June 1982. His formal education culminated in November 1997 with a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Creative Arts with a Specialization in Art Therapy from the Union Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio 
Work.
Bruce Moon has been the director of the graduate art therapy program at Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since 2001. Prior to this position, he was a professor and the director of the graduate art therapy program at Marywood University in Scranton, Pennsylvania from 1996 to 2001. He was also co-director of the graduate clinical art therapy program at Harding Hospital in Worthington, Ohio from 1988 until 1996, which is an affiliate of Lesley College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was also an adjunct faculty member and affiliation coordinator.
Bruce Moon is a licensed professional counselor in the state of Illinois, and a registered and board certified art therapist. He is a consultant to the Student Counseling Service at Mount Mary College, and has performed art therapy services pro bono at the Alternative Behavioral Treatment Center in Mundelein, Illinois since 2005. During that time Moon requested to work with those clients that were particularly resistant to engage in therapy. Moon also led a group for adolescent males who had committed a sexual offense. He ran a private practice in Worthington, Ohio from 1989 until 1996, providing individual art therapy services for children, adolescents, and adults. From 1986 until 1992, he was the Chief of Adjunctive Therapy of Harding Hospital's Child and Adolescent Division. He also worked as an arts specialist from 1973 to 1975 at the Worthington Community Counseling Service.
Works.
Moon has written a number of books, done presentations, continues to do research and make artwork.
Artwork.
Bruce Moon believes art making is a spiritual and sacred act; art is soul, and creating art creates the soul. His faith lies in creative expression as the best form of communication between the internal and external worlds, and between the self and God.
According to Moon, making art serves an existential purpose and can help people overcome feelings of emptiness and hopelessness. In art therapy sessions Moon focuses more on the processes involved and responding to the artwork, more than the product itself. He responds to artwork with conversation, bodily gestures, sound, spontaneous performance, and painting.
Bruce Moon's medium of choice is painting, as evidenced by the illustrations in his books. He tends to use his own imagery to accompany his writings. He pursues other modes of creative expression including performance art and poetry. He is a singer/songwriter, has recorded several albums, and regularly performs at small concert venues. "Bobby Wouldn't Speak" is a song Moon has recorded, and posted to YouTube, describing an adolescent boy with whom he worked who was the victim of abuse. Some other songs are "Love Called Him Like a River," "Roads Desire," "She'd like to be a Ballerina," and "Antoine's Got a Razor in his Heart." These are all songs about clients with whom Moon has worked and his way of conveying their stories. He is the co-editor of the book "Word Pictures: The Poetry and Art of Art Therapists" (2004), which is a unique collection of artwork, poems, and essays by art therapists and art therapy students.
Moon also displayed his artwork in exhibits across the country. He had an exhibit in November 2012 at the Marian Art Gallery at Mount Mary College called These Places Have Their Moments.
Presentations.
In the fall of 2012, Moon presented with his wife as keynote speakers at the Canadian Art Therapy Association national conference. Their presentation was called Collaboration and Connection: A Call to Art and held a workshop as well, called Art Therapy Couture: Presenting Our Best Professional Selves. During the summer of 2012, he spent time in Hong Kong and Taiwan where he was the keynote speaker at conferences at Hong Kong University and the Taipei Municipal Educators College in Taiwan.

Lu Yanwei

Lu Yanwei (盧彥威) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who controlled Yichang Circuit (義昌, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) from 885 to 898, most of that time as its military governor ("Jiedushi").
Background and seizure of Yichang Circuit.
Little is known about Lu Yanwei's background, as neither of the official histories of Tang Dynasty — the "Book of Tang" and the "New Book of Tang" — contained a biography for him. The first reference to him in the "Zizhi Tongjian" was in 885, when a mutiny at Yichang's capital Cang Prefecture (滄州) led to the expulsion of the previously military governor Yang Quanmei (楊全玫), who fled to neighboring Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing). The soldiers supported Lu to be their acting military governor. Then-reigning Emperor Xizong, however, did not make Lu military governor, instead commissioning the imperial guard officer Cao Cheng (曹誠) as military governor and Lu as the prefect of one of Yichang's three prefectures, De Prefecture (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong).
However, it appeared that Lu refused to allow Cao to report to Yichang, and continued to request a military governor commission; the imperial government repeatedly rejected his request. In 890, by which time Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong was emperor and was launching a general campaign against the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Lu's neighbors Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Luo Hongxin the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) petitioned the imperial government on his behalf again. The imperial government, already locked in a campaign against Li Keyong, decided to commission Lu as military governor.
As military governor.
In late 894, Li Keyong attacked and conquered Lulong. Lulong's military governor Li Kuangchou fled to Yichang. Instead of taking Li Kuangchou under his protection, however, Lu Yanwei was envious of the amount of wealth that Li Kuangchou brought from Lulong, and so attacked Li Kuangchou at Jingcheng (景城, in modern Cangzhou) and killed him, seizing his wealth and his followers, including his concubines.
As the years went by, Lu developed a reputation for being cruel and insolent in his relations with neighboring circuits. As of 898, he was locked in a dispute over the salt trade with Lulong's then-military governor Liu Rengong (whom Li Keyong installed). Liu sent his son Liu Shouwen to attack Cang Prefecture. Lu could not resist the attack, and therefore abandoned the city and fled to Weibo Circuit with his family. When Luo Hongxin refused to receive him, he further fled to Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). That was the last reference in history about Lu, and it is not known what his fate was once he fled to Xuanwu.

Ihmisten edessä (song)

"Ihmisten edessä" () is a Finnish-language pop song by Finnish pop singer Jenni Vartiainen. It was released by Warner Music Finland on 5 September 2007 as the second single from her eponymous debut album "Ihmisten edessä".
Written by Teemu Brunila, the lyrics to "Ihmisten edessä" talk about a couple's struggles with showing their romantic affection in public. The music video depicts the couple as two females, though Vartiainen, when interviewed by "City" magazine, said the song could be about any couple whose love is not accepted by the surrounding society. In 2008, Seta, the main Finnish LGBT organization, awarded Vartiainen and Brunila with its annual award, Asiallisen tiedon omena (the "Apple of Objective Information"), for the song. According to Seta, the piece is "an apposite evocation of the courage needed from LGBT people e.g. to hold hands in public".
"Ihmisten edessä" debuted at number 20 on the Finnish Singles Chart and peaked at number two on its fourth week, while charting for 33 weeks. The single topped the Download Chart on its seventh week. "Ihmisten edessä" has sold platinum in Finland with over 16,000 copies to date, was the sixth-best-selling single of 2008 and ranks currently 66th on the list of the best-selling singles of all time in the country.

Compounds of californium

Few compounds of californium have been made and studied. The only californium ion that is stable in aqueous solutions is the californium(III) cation. The other two oxidation states are IV (strong oxidizing agents) and II (strong reducing agents). The element forms a water-soluble chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride, oxalate or hydroxide. If problems of availability of the element could be overcome, then CfBr2 and CfI2 would likely be stable. 
The +3 oxidation state is represented by californium(III) oxide (yellow-green, Cf2O3), californium(III) fluoride (bright green, CfF3) and californium(III) iodide (lemon yellow, CfI3). Other +3 oxidation states include the sulfide and metallocene. Californium(IV) oxide (black brown, CfO2), californium(IV) fluoride (green, CfF4) represent the IV oxidation state. The II state is represented by californium(II) bromide (yellow, CfBr2) and californium(II) iodide (dark violet, CfI2).
Compounds.
Californium(IV) oxide (CfO2) is a black-brown solid that has a cubic crystal structure with a lattice parameter, the distance between unit cells in the crystal, of 531.0 ± 0.2 pm. Crystals of californium(III) oxide normally have a body-centered cubic symmetry. They convert to a monoclinic form upon heating to about 1400 °C and melt at 1750 °C. 
Californium(III) chloride (CfCl3) is an emerald green compound with a hexagonal structure that can be prepared by reacting Cf2O3 with hydrochloric acid at 500 °C. CfCl3 is then used as a feeder stock to form the yellow-orange triiodide CfI3, which in turn can be reduced to the lavender-violet diiodide CfI2. 
Californium(III) fluoride (CfF3) is a yellow-green solid with a crystal symmetry that gradually changes from orthorhombic to trigonal when heated above room temperature. Californium(IV) fluoride (CfF4) is a bright green solid with a monoclinic crystal structure.
Californium(II) iodide (CfI2) is a deep purple solid with a stable rhombohedral structure at room temperature and an unstable hexagonal structure. Californium(III) iodide (CfI3) is a lemon-yellow solid that has a rhombohedral structure and sublimes at ~800 °C.
Californium(III) oxyfluoride (CfOF) is prepared by hydrolysis of californium(III) fluoride (CfF3) at high temperature. Californium(III) oxychloride (CfOCl) is prepared by hydrolysis of the hydrate of californium(III) chloride at 280–320 °C.
Heating the sulfate in air at about 1200 °C and then reducing with hydrogen at 500 °C produces the sesquioxide (Cf2O3). The hydroxide Cf(OH)3 and the trifluoride CfF3 are slightly soluble.
Californium(III) oxychloride (CfOCl) was the first californium compound to be discovered.
Californium is the second-heaviest element for which an organometallic compound is known. Cp3Cf (Cp = C5H5) was prepared from reaction of Cp2Be and CfCl3 on microgram scale and characterized by X-ray crystallography.

The Hiker (Kitson)

The Hiker is a statue created by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson. It commemorates the American soldiers who fought in the Spanish–American War, the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine–American War. The first version of it was made for the University of Minnesota in 1906, but at least 50 copies were made, and were erected very widely across the United States. 
""The Hiker depicts a hero stripped of his parade uniform and shown as a soldier reacting to the challenges of the battlefield."" 
Original.
When she created The Hiker, Kitson already had a reputation for sculpting war memorial statues. For the title of her work, Kitson used the term that American soldiers in both the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War gave themselves: "hikers". Leonard Sefing, Jr., a Spanish–American War veteran from Allentown, Pennsylvania, was selected as the model for the statue after a photograph of him was entered into a national contest.
The original statue was unveiled at the University of Minnesota on Memorial Day, 1906. The statue stands in front of the armory at 15 Church Street. Also known as the "Student Soldier Memorial", it is a monument to the 218 University of Minnesota students who served in the Spanish–American War. The statue is tall and stands on a granite base, depicting a soldier clad in a period uniform with a campaign hat and a Krag-Jørgensen rifle. Today this statue, now missing its gun tip, is popularly known as Iron Mike.
Locations.
Kitson's work proved to be very popular, largely because of its realism and historical accuracy. In 1921, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, located in Providence, Rhode Island, bought the rights to the statue, and over the next 44 years Gorham cast at least 50 "Hiker" statues. The earliest installations tended to be in the northeastern United States, with post-World War II statues installed mostly in the South and West.
Because of the wide distribution of the statues, they have recently been used to study air pollution over the last century.

Notorious (ship)

The Notorious is a replica fifteenth century caravel. The ship has taken ten years to build, made entirely from reclaimed timber. It was launched at Martins Point, Port Fairy, Victoria, Australia on Monday, 7 February 2011. The Notorious was fitted with sails and conducted its first week long journey from Port Fairy to Geelong in January 2012.
Background.
The "Notorious" has been a project of Graeme Wylie and wife Felicite, who originally started the project 10 years ago. The inspiration for the ship was a local legend (or possible history) of the area where the Wylies lived, the Mahogany Ship. The story is that a Portuguese shipwreck had long been located in the area, and was still visible in the mid-1800s, but since has been covered over with sand.
Inspired by this legend, Wylie has spent twenty thousand dollars Australian, and thousands of manhours, working on the ship. The ship has been carefully built based on period drawings of caravelles, as well as advice from historians. The ship was known while under construction as the "Raven", but christened the "Notorious" when launched in February 2011 at Martin's Point in Port Fairy, Victoria. Wylie is a keen sailor and a professional cabinetmaker.
Construction.
The keel for the ship was laid in April 2002. The keel itself is made from ironbark salvaged from a road at the Breakwater in Warnambool, near where Wylie lives. The ribs of the ship were completed towards the end of 2003. By 2008 the ship was opened to the public at the construction site, while the planking was still being completed. The ship was largely completed by February 2011.
The ship weighs 55 tonnes, and is a replica Caravel, a type of ship used in the 15th century. It is 21 metres long, six metres wide and 17 metres high. Apart from the keel, most of the wood for its construction is recycled & reclaimed Monterey Cypress, and the ship is covered in 600 litres of tar.
The interior is an authentic period design, including a cooking fire. The ship has modern GPS navigation, a diesel engine and some other mod cons, all hidden behind timber panels.

Clark Bentom

Clark Bentom ( ) was an English missionary and surgeon, who was a missionary in Canada at Quebec City, Quebec, from 1800 to 1805.
Bentom had a congregation and conducted a Presbyterian-style ministry with varied success. He was not accepted by the established clergy in the city and was eventually jailed for performing baptisms, marriages and burials without authorization for civil registers.
His time in Quebec was notable in advancing the rights of non-Catholics and non-Anglicans to worship in freedom and be protected by law.

National History Bee and Bowl

The National History Bee and Bowl (NHBB) are nationwide history quiz competitions for high school, middle school, and elementary students in the United States. Both the National History Bee and the National History Bowl were contested for the first time in the 2010-2011 academic year. Students first compete at regional qualifying tournaments, from which the top students advance to the National Championships for the History Bee and History Bowl, which are held each spring. The competitions were founded in June 2010 by David Madden, a former 19-day champion on "Jeopardy!", who serves as Executive Director for both The National History Bee and The National History Bowl. At high school level tournaments of the National History Bee and Bowl, students also have the opportunity to compete in the National Qualifying Exam of the United States Geography Olympiad. Beginning in the fall of 2013, NHBB also introduced the United States History Bee, a competition for high school students focusing solely on American history.
The National History Bee and Bowl are sponsored by History, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who provide both outreach support as well as cash and other prizes at the respective NHBB National Championships.
National History Bee.
National History Bee High School Competition.
At the High School level, the National History Bee consists of two stages, the Regional Bees and the National Championships. Some Regional Bees are designated as State Championships - these, however, are still open to out of state students, and do not require any prior qualification. Three different sets of questions (A, B, and C) are used for the Regional Bees; students may thus compete up to three times in advance of the National Championships, as long as they have not yet played the designated question set that a Regional Bee is using. The High School level of The National History Bee is open to younger students, though the different levels of The National History Bee function completely separately regarding qualification for the National Championships. Additionally, the High School level features a Junior Varsity division, for students up through 10th grade. All questions used in the High School level of the National History Bee and the National History Bowl are written by HSAPQ, an outside company, though NHBB staff participate in the editing process.
Regional Bees feature three preliminary rounds of 30 questions each, followed by a 1, 2, or 3 stage final, depending on how many students are taking part. The placement of students is random for each round and in each round, contestants compete in a room with up to seven other students. As at all Regional and National competitions overseen by NHBB, students use a lockout buzzer system to ring in when they know the answer to a question. When the question is read, the contestant may interrupt the moderator to answer the question early, but if a student misses the question, they cannot ring in again. Students receive 1 point per question answered correctly. The first and second student to ring in incorrectly never receive a penalty, but if a third person buzzes in and answers incorrectly before the question is finished, they will be receive a one-point penalty, and the question is dropped. If a third person buzzes in after the question is read and answers incorrectly, they receive no penalty, but the question is still dropped. If a contestant reaches 8 points at any time during the round, they are no longer allowed to answer. Reaching 8 points results in the contestant receiving a bonus, with more bonus points possible if the 8-question limit is reached earlier in the game. 
Students whose total preliminary score is in the top half of the field at any Regional Bee qualify for the National Championships. The number of students who advance to the Regional Bee Finals, as well as the structure of the Regional Bee Finals, varies from event to event.
National Championships.
The first national championships were held at Parkersburg High School. Since 2012, the High School National Championships of The National History Bee have been held at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Arlington, Virginia on a Sunday in late April. There are six preliminary rounds of competition, with the top students then advancing to three final stages. The final stage of the Varsity Division pits four students against each other; the first to a certain number of points (10-15) wins. The final stage of the Junior Varsity Division pits two students against each other; the first to 15 is the champion. In 2013, approximately 190 students competed at the Varsity Division, and 140 competed in the Junior Varsity Division at the National Championships.
National History Bee Middle School Competition.
The National History Bee Middle School Competition was launched across the USA in the fall of the 2011-2012 school year. The Middle School level differs from the high school level by containing an additional official competition stage, the Online Regional Qualifying Examn (ORQE). Typically, the top 4 students at a school (often determined by an intramural competition) are allowed to take the ORQE although students may also register individually for it. The top 120 students within a region (for the 2013-14 year, there are 37 of these) then qualify for the Regional Bees, where they are seeded according to their ORQE results. In contrast with the High School Regional Bees, the Regional Bees at the Middle School level are not held at the same dates and sites as the Middle School level Regional Bowls. Furthermore, while High School level students may compete at up to three different Regional Bees, with no geographic restrictions on participation, Middle School (and Elementary School level students) may only compete at one Regional Bee, and the site is determined by geographic proximity to their school or homeschool association (or home in the case of students who have signed up independently).
The Regional Bees are structurally similar to the Regional Bees at the high school level, with three preliminary rounds in which all students compete followed by a final, although the scoring system differs slightly. The Regional Bees also feature competition on a lockout buzzer system with "pyramidal questions." These questions are of paragraph length and progress from more difficult clues to easier clues. Students can ring in with the buzzer at any time during the reading of the questions; thus rewarding students with deeper knowledge. 
National Championships.
In the inaugural 2011-2012 competition season, the winner of each Regional Bee won a trip to Washington, DC where the final rounds were held at Trinity Washington University and televised on HISTORY. The winning student, Tajin Rogers of McLean, VA won a $50,000 scholarship. Since 2012, HISTORY and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt have remained sponsors of all levels of NHBB by providing prizes at the National Championships and outreach assistance, though no further NHBB events have been televised to date.
For the 2012-2013 competition season, the format of the National Championships was changed so that the top 40% of finishers at the Regional Bees qualified for Nationals. Competitors though then had to cover their travel to the National Championship site in Atlanta, as well as pay an additional entry fee (which also mirrors the high school level). Approximately 400 students competed in the 2013 National Championships which was won by Jonathan Tran of Portland, Oregon. The 2014 National Championships will also be held in Atlanta along these lines. 
National History Bee Elementary School Competition.
The National History Bee was opened to elementary school-aged students for the 2012-2013 competition season. At the Elementary School level, the ORQE functions the same way as it does at the Middle School level. In 2012-2013, elementary school-aged students competed together with middle school-aged students at the Regional Bees. However, for purposes of qualifying for the National Championships elementary school-aged students only needed to finish in the top 40% of elementary school-aged students at any given site, not in the top 40% of all students combined. 
Beginning with the 2013-14 competition season, elementary school-aged students will also compete in a separate group of students at the Regional Bees, as long as entry numbers allow for this. The Regional Bees for the Middle School and Elementary School levels will still be held at the same times and locations, though.
National Championships.
The National Championships of the National History Bee Elementary School Competition are held at the same site on the same date as the Middle School National Championships. At the inaugural 2013 National Championships for the Elementary School Competition, approximately 50 students competed, and Foster Michaelis of Johns Creek, Georgia was the champion. Unlike at the Middle School or High School levels, the Elementary School National Championships features both buzzer-based play and various other competition elements, such as written and questions directed at single students.
The National History Bowl.
The National History Bowl is an entirely different competition from the National History Bee, as the competitors qualify and compete as teams in a buzzer-based format very similar to that used by standard high school quiz bowl tournaments. As with the National History Bee, the National History Bowl is contested at the High School (including separate Varsity and Junior Varsity Divisions) and Middle School level. As of 2014, there is not a separate elementary school level for the National History Bowl, though elementary school teams are welcome to compete at the Middle School level. 
National History Bowl High School Competition.
The National History Bowl is contested at the same sites as the National History Bee for the High School level, however, the Bee and the Bowl are held at different times during the day so that students can compete in both. The History Bowl, like the History Bee, is run on 3 sets of questions at the Regional level - the question set used (A, B, or C) is the same for both the Bee and Bowl at any given site. For the 2013-2014 competition season, approximately 105 Regional tournaments are being held across the USA. Typically, tournaments are held on Saturdays and last all day - some events are held on Sundays or Federal Holidays, or, more rarely, after school. National History Bowl High School level tournaments feature a Varsity and Junior Varsity division - JV teams may not carry 11th or 12th graders as players. A typical tournament will feature 5 rounds of preliminary matches with up to 5 playoff rounds then subsequently contested among the top teams in the preliminaries. Up to four students compete at any one time on a team, though teams at Regionals can carry two substitutes (there is no limit on substitutes at Nationals) and there is no minimum number of players a team needs to have.
The round format of the National History Bowl differs slightly from a traditional quiz bowl format. Each game is divided into four quarters, and there are no penalties for incorrect answers at any point within the game. However, if a student on one team buzzes in and answers a tossup question incorrectly, that student's teammates are prohibited from ringing in and trying to answer that particular question. As in the National History Bee, the tossup questions are "pyramidal," that is, they become easier towards the end of the question, which rewards depth of knowledge for students able to ring in early.
The first quarter consists of ten tossups, which are each worth 10 points. There are no bonus points for correctly answering the tossup question early, or bonus questions for getting the tossup question correct. 
The second quarter consists of eight tossups, also worth 10 points each. However, in the second quarter, if a team answers a tossup question correctly, they get a chance at a related bonus question worth an extra ten points if correctly answered. On the bonus questions, team members can confer with each other, in contrast with the tossups. If a team answers the bonus question incorrectly, the moderator simply reveals the answer; it does not then go over to the other team.
In the third quarter, teams are given a choice of three categories of questions to choose from, with the trailing team deciding first. Each team is given one minute to answer up to 8 short questions on that category, with each question being worth 10 points. If all questions are answered correctly, a 20 point bonus is added. Each question a team answers incorrectly in their category is given to the other team to answer for the same number of points, but only after the full 60 seconds are over. If time elapses, then only those questions that have been read (and answered incorrectly) are turned over to the other team; unheard questions remain unread to the other team.
The fourth quarter consists of eight relatively longer tossup questions. If students ring in early, they can earn 30 or 20 points, or 10, if they answer correctly at the end of the question. Ties are broken, so that each game ends in a win and a loss, but tiebreaker questions do not have a point value, for playoff seeding purposes.
National History Bowl High School National Championships.
Teams qualify for the National History Bowl High School National Championships by finishing with at least a .500 winning percentage in their preliminary matches at any of the Regional tournament sites. Teams may also qualify by winning a playoff game, if they enter the playoffs with a losing record. The National History Bowl High School National Championships are also held in conjunction with the History Bee High School National Championships (i.e. on the same weekend). At the High School National Championships, the majority of matches (including all playoff rounds) are held at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Arlington, VA, though roughly a third of the matches are contested at sites throughout Arlington and Washington, DC. These sites have includes embassies, museums of the Smithsonian Institutions, historic mansions, and other culturally significant sites. 
In 2013, 132 Varsity and 66 Junior Varsity teams competed at the National Championships. The winning Varsity team from Bellarmine College Preparatory consisted of a single student, Sameer Rai, who also won the National History Bee that year. At the National Championships, there are also separate National Championship titles awarded to the Small Schools (i.e. non-magnet public high schools with 1000 or fewer students) who advance the farthest in the tournament - this began in 2012 for the Varsity Division and 2013 for the Junior Varsity Division. There is not a separate draw for these teams.
The National Championships features seeded groups of 6 teams in the morning preliminary rounds who play a round robin over five games. The top three teams in each group advance to the Upper Bracket rounds in the afternoon, where they play another round robin over five games. The bottom three teams in each group play either 3 or 5 consolation rounds in the afternoon. The top Upper Bracket teams in the afternoon advance to a single elimination playoff, beginning on Saturday evening, and continuing into Sunday afternoon (after the History Bee preliminary rounds). The playoff matches at the National Championships are slightly longer than standard matches.
National History Bowl Middle School Competition.
Since 2011, the National History Bowl has welcomed middle school teams. High School level tournaments are always open to middle school participation in the Junior Varsity Division. Certain tournaments may also contain a separate middle school division, though beginning in 2013-2014, this has become rare, as a separate set of National History Bowl Regional tournaments are planned for middle school teams independent of high school participation. The round structure at the Middle School level is identical to the High School level, although the questions tend to be shorter. 
National History Bowl Middle School National Championships.
The National History Bowl Middle School National Championships were held in the Washington, DC area in 2012 and 2013. Beginning in 2014, they will be held in conjunction with the National History Bee Middle School National Championships. The structure of the National History Bowl Middle School National Championships has varied considerably over its first two years, and will be shifted again in 2014 to accommodate a greater number of participating teams. For the 2014 National Championships at the Middle School level, there is no required qualification process at the Regional level.
United States History Bee.
Beginning in the 2013-2014 competition season, NHBB also debuted a new High School level competition, the United States History Bee. This competition is distinct from the National History Bee, as it focuses solely on American history. It is not divided into Varsity and Junior Varsity Divisions. It is contested at approximately 30 Regional sites around the USA and also utilizes a buzzer system and pyramidal questions. Students may only compete once at any Regional site; if they finish in the top 50% of the four preliminary rounds, make the finals, or submit a wild card bid, they may qualify for the National Championships. The National Championships for the US History Bee are held at the same site as the standard High School National Championships on the Friday prior to the other events.

Lizzette Kattan

Lizzette Kattan, is a Honduran-born fashion editor that worked between Milan and New York from 1976 until 1986 for Harper's Bazaar Italy, Harper's Bazaar France, Uomo Harper's Bazaar and Italian Cosmopolitan. She collaborated with virtually every major photographer of that period and discovered many of today's most recognizable photographic talent. Once retired from the fashion world Lizzette started her diplomatic career as the Commercial Attache of the Honduran Embassy in Rome, in 1990, and eventually becoming the Consulate General of Milan in 2002 until 2007. She currently works as a freelance Stylist for international publications. 
Lizzette is fluent in English, French, Italian, and Spanish.
Early life.
Lizzette was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Her family relocated to New York City while in her teens. Her passion throughout her childhood was not fashion but oddly enough archeology. And thus she pursued a degree in Anthropology at Hunter College. Eileen Ford discovered Lizzette on the streets of New York and proposed to her to become a model. The decision to start a modeling career was met with some hesitation, as Lizzette never considered working in the fashion industry.
Career.
Fashion career.
Lizzette signed with Ford Models and started working in New York City. She traveled throughout Europe and worked for the likes of GQ, ELLE France, Italian Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar Italia. 
Her interest of being in front of camera waned during her short modeling career and she gradually pursued a job at Edizioni Syds, which owned Harper’s Bazaar Italia. She began her career organizing photo shoots for Italian Cosmopolitan. Her big break came in 1976 when she took over as the Fashion Director of Italian Cosmopolitan, a position she held until 1986.
Her powerful creative work gained momentum and she took over as the Fashion Director of Harper’s Bazaar Italia in 1978. Her greatest accomplishment was launching Men’s Harper’s Bazaar in 1979. The magazine was later renamed Harper’s Bazaar Uomo. She fostered many close ties with the greatest talents of that period such as Valentino, Gianni Versace, Ottavio Missoni and Calvin Klein. 
She aggressively pursued some of the best photographic talent in the industry collaborating on projects with Chris von Wangenheim, Albert Watson, Arthur Elgort and Patrick Demarchelier. Her most notable assets was discovering young photographers and allowing them to develop their talent. This opportunity gave way to some of the most recognizable names of today such as Herb Ritts and Steven Meisel. Meisel, an illustrator working at Women's Wear Daily, would later become synonymous with Italian – and American Vogue. During the same time she met and launched Gia Carangi's career booking her for back to back shoots for Harper's Bazaar Italia with photographer Chris von Wangenheim. 
In 1983 Harper’s Bazaar France opened its doors in Paris with Lizzette as the Editor-in-chief, a position she held until December 1985.
Lizzette retired from her positions at Harper’s Bazaar in 1986 to raise her two sons.
Diplomatic career.
In 1990 Lizzette became the commercial attaché of the Honduran Embassy in Rome. She was responsible for various publications attracting foreign investment from Italy. In 2002 Lizzette became the Consul general of Honduras in Milan, which serviced the region of Lombardy and Venice. This post was held until 2007. 
In effort to promote the country of Honduras Lizzette created a quarterly publication called “Honduran Highlights” which highlighted culture, tourism and investment opportunities. The publication existed from 1990 to 2007. 
Lizzette created the concept and help organize two museum exhibits in Europe. “Les Mayas au pays de Copan” was held at the Abbaye de Daoulas from the 5th of April and 7 September 1997. “I Maya di Copan – L’atene del Centro America” was exhibited at the Palazzo Reale in Milan from the 3rd of October 1997 to the 1st of March 1998.

Georgia Wing Civil Air Patrol

The Georgia Wing of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is the highest echelon of CAP in the State of Georgia. Georgia Wing headquarters are located.
Georgia Wing is abbreviated as "GAWG", and is often referred to by its members as "GA Wing".
Structure.
Georgia Wing is the highest echelon of Civil Air Patrol in Georgia. GA Wing reports to Southeast Region CAP, who reports to CAP National Headquarters.
Below the Wing level, Georgia is divided into Groups. Each Group conducts its own training and programs, as well as participating in larger scale training and events with the rest of Georgia Wing, Southeast Region, and National CAP organizations (e.g. professional development classes, emergency services training classes and exercises, cadet flight orientation events, and cadet and senior aerospace and leadership training events). 
Underneath each Group are numerous squadrons. Squadrons are the local level of organization, and squadrons typically meet weekly to conduct training. There are three types of Civil Air Patrol squadrons. A cadet squadron focus primarily on providing training and education (leadership, character development, aerospace education, and emergency services training) for cadets. A senior squadron is a unit dedicated to allowing senior members to focus on CAP's missions. Composite squadrons have both cadets and senior members working together.
Groups and Squadrons.
Group I.
Group I is responsible for operations in and around Northwestern Georgia.
Group II.
Group II operates around North Eastern Georgia.
Group III.
Group III operates in the Mid West area.
Group IV.
Group IV conducts operations in the Central area.
Schools.
Georgia Wing conducts a number of schools to support its three main missions (Emergency Services, Aerospace Education, and Cadet Programs). These schools provide instruction and hands on experience to members in a variety of areas, ranging from aviation to search and rescue.
Cadet Activities.
See http://www.ncsas.com/ for more information on post-Encampment special activity events.
Encampment
This school is normally a week long in-residence training program for cadets age 12-20, supervised by trained adult Cadet Programs Officers with USAF oversight. The encampment teaches basic cadets the fundamentals of followership and discipline in a fun environment that is both academic and applied, with hands on events. This course is typically held on a local military base (see CAPR 52-16, Chapter 9 for more detail) and typical activities may include supervised rappelling, orientation flights in military aircraft, tours of base units and facilities, etc. Encampment is NOT basic training; per CAPR 52-16 Ch.9, prospective encampment attendees must first complete promotion requirements for their first stripe (Curry Award) at their home unit, inclusive of passing physical fitness run/pushup/sit up/sit and reach standards, their first Leadership test, must have memorized the Cadet Oath, and must pass inspection for wear and grooming standards in both the USAF Blues and BDU uniform combinations. Encampment IS intended to provide cadets with a taste of military life (typically with military style accommodations, food, and formations) intended to foster leadership growth and personal development in a positive, military style advanced training environment. Encampment completion is required for promotion to Cadet Officer and is also the required gateway activity to qualify cadets to then attend National Special Activities (below). For more information, see http://capmembers.com/cadet_programs/activities/encampments.cfm
RCLS is also a typically week long course, offered for cadets in the grade of C/CMSGT and above per CAPR 52-16 (Section 8-7). RCLS is similar to Air Force ROTC's Field Training program, focusing on developing advanced cadets' leadership potential as indirect (officer role) leaders as opposed to direct (enlisted/NCO) leaders. This course involves both classroom instruction and applied leadership skills. and may be held within Georgia Wing or within a neighboring Wing of the Southeast Region.
Glider Flight Encampments are held throughout the nation, and instruct cadets in the principles of flight, culminating in several rides with qualified instructors in an unpowered glider.
Powered Flight Encampments instruct cadets in the basics of aviation. Cadets learn about ground and air procedures, as well as fly in CAP owned Cessna 172s and 182s. Cadets that do well during the program may earn their solo wings.
Other Schools.
Squadrons are the local unit of Civil Air Patrol, and this course covers material related to the successful operation of a Civil Air Patrol squadron.
Contact information.
Georgia Wing Headquarters is normally staffed between 0830 to 1700 Local time on business days, and occasionally on weekends and other times as required.

Luke Matheny

Luke Matheny (born December 23, 1976) is an American actor, writer, and director. Matheny is an Academy Award winner, receiving the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for "God of Love".
Early years.
Matheny was born in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of DiAnn and Mat Matheny, a pipe welder and furniture designer. He graduated from Wilmington's Concord High School in 1993 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1997 from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. 
He later worked as a reporter and copy editor for a variety of trade magazines and web sites in Chicago. His career includes stints as a synopsis writer for Netflix and as a story editor for the MTV series "Made".
In 1998 Matheny developed a plan with three friends to shoot a movie about three under-appreciated losers from Chicago who quit their jobs, move to Paris, and become street musicians. Matheny and his friends quit their jobs, moved to Paris, and started shooting the film in May 2001. The film premiered at the 2003 Wilmington Independent Film Festival. Matheny recalled, ""It was weird; we hit the ground and started casting people off the street. We were hanging out with Parisian models. It was like this weird Cinderella experience. At the end of it we were all completely broke and living with our parents. ... There're probably 33 funny minutes in it, but we really had no idea what we were doing at all. And at some point I decided that I really wanted to keep doing this.""
NYU, "Earano," and "God of Love".
Matheny moved to New York in 2004 and enrolled at NYU Tisch School of the Arts as a graduate student in the film program. His first student film at NYU was "Earano", a comic twist on "Cyrano de Bergerac", with the title character having unusually large ears instead of a large nose. "Earano" won the King Award for Screenwriting at the NYU First Run Festival and Best Student Short at the Dam Short Film Festival in Boulder City, Nevada. In its review of "Earano", "New York Magazine" wrote: "One of our favorites of recent years comes in the form of Earano, a charming and hilarious short film directed by and starring Luke Matheny, in which our lead hero has not a giant proboscis but two giant ears, and longs for a beautiful librarian (Emily Young), who has eyes for a hunky Ukrainian janitor."
For his thesis project at NYU, Matheny wrote, directed and starred in the Academy Award-winning film, "God of Love". The film is a comedy about a lounge-singing darts champion Raymond Goodfellow (portrayed by Matheny) "who finds his prayers are answered – literally – when he receives a mysterious package of passion-inducing darts." The catch is that the woman he loves, a drummer in his band, is in love with Ray's best friend, the guitarist in the band. Matheny funded "God of Love" with a combination of student loans, his savings and some production grants, and shot the film in 10 days. Matheny described the bohemian feel he sought to establish for the film as follows:"I'm a huge jazz fan, and I've always loved jazz photography from the 1950s and ’60s. I knew that the film would open in a kind of bohemian-ish jazz setting, so I thought that this kind of black-and-white visual treatment would give the movie an overall cool, romantic, nostalgic quality. And, of course, my cinematographer Bobby Webster was a key player in helping me bring that idea to life. We looked at lots of films that featured jazz scenes: 'I Want to Live!' and 'Paris Blues' were two visual touchstones, in particular. The French New Wave was an aesthetic influence, as well, in some of the film's montage scenes."
Academy Award.
On February 27, 2011, Matheny won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for "God of Love." The film had previously been rejected by Sundance and Slamdance. In a pre-Oscars interview, Matheny noted, "The Oscar nomination means a lot to me. I've been kind of a psycho Oscar fan my whole life and even, at one point, memorized every Best Picture winner -- which is still a pretty good party trick -- so to actually get a nomination is an amazing event in my life."
Matheny's acceptance speech was considered one of the highlights of the Academy Awards telecast. Descriptions of Matheny's appearance at the award ceremony ranged from the merely descriptive ("mop-haired," "bushy-haired,") to the critical ("somewhat shaggy-looking," "Brillo-headed," and "a vast black bouffant that makes him look like an untidy microphone.") and even laudatory ("follicularly fecund," the "God of Hair"). TV Guide rated him as the "Worst Groomed" nominee. At the start of his acceptance speech, Matheny, joked, "I should've gotten a haircut." He went on to thank his mother, who provided craft services on the film, the "great state of Delaware," and "the love of my life," the Russian-born composer, Sasha Gordon, who scored the film. The "Los Angeles Times" reported it was "safe to say he was out of his comfort zone during the star-studded event," and noted that Matheny admitted he was "standing behind Robert Downey Jr., trying to get on TV." "The Salt Lake Tribune" called him "a contender for the best acceptance speech." The "Calgary Herald" reported, "We didn't know who Luke Matheny was before he won an Oscar for Best Live Action Short for "God of Love", but we fell in love with him the moment the mop-haired director opened his mouth ... The young filmmaker's enthusiasm was infectious, and even the Hollywood elite applauded when Matheny thanked his mother ..."
Other works.
Matheny's first feature film, "A Birder's Guide to Everything", a coming-of-age comedy, was co-written with Rob Meyer, will be released by Focus World and Screen Media on March 21, 2014.

Yang Shouliang

Yang Shouliang (楊守亮) (d. 894), né Zi Liang (訾亮), was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who controlled Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) from 887 to 892. He was initially an agrarian rebel under Wang Xianzhi, but later came to serve under the imperial eunuch general Yang Fuguang, becoming Yang Fuguang's adoptive son. He was gradually promoted in the imperial guard ranks, and was eventually made the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Shannan West by Emperor Xizong. After his adoptive uncle Yang Fugong broke with Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong in 891, however, Yang Shouliang followed Yang Fugong's lead and resisted the imperial government. He was subsequently defeated by the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and executed.
Background.
It is not known when Zi Liang was born, but it is known that he was from Cao Prefecture (曹州, in modern Heze, Shandong). Both he and his younger brother Zi Xin (訾信) became followers of the agrarian rebel Wang Xianzhi. After Wang's death in battle, they followed another agrarian rebel, Xu Tangju (徐唐莒), in pillaging Hong (洪州, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) and Rao (饒州, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) Prefectures. When the imperial eunuch general Yang Fuguang pacified the region, he captured Zi Liang and Zi Xin and made them his adoptive sons, changing their names to Yang Shouliang and Yang Shouxin (楊守信).
As imperial guard officer.
Yang Shouliang's activities during the subsequent years under his adoptive father Yang Fuguang were not clear. By 886, when Yang Fuguang had died and Yang Fuguang's adoptive brother Yang Fugong was the most powerful eunuch at the court of then-reigning Emperor Xizong — which was then in exile at Xingyuan (興元, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), trying to fight off the rival claim to the Tang throne by Li Yun at the imperial capital Chang'an — Yang Shouliang was serving as the commander of one of the corps of the imperial guards, the Hubi Corps (扈蹕都); that summer, during the campaign against Li Yun and Li Yun's chief supporter Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Emperor Xizong commissioned Yang Shouliang as the military governor of Jinshang Circuit (金商, headquartered in modern Ankang, Shaanxi) and the controller (制置使, "Zhizhishi") of the capital region, with the goal of attacking north from Jinshang's capital Jin Prefecture (金州) to recapture Chang'an with the forces of the military governors Wang Chongrong the military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) (who had previously battled imperial forces but had returned their allegiance to Emperor Xizong by this point). It is unclear what progress, if any, Yang Shouliang actually made. Regardless, by spring 887, Zhu had been killed by his own subordinate Wang Xingyu; Li Yun fled to Wang Chongrong's domain and was executed by Wang Chongrong, ending his rival claim on the imperial throne. Yang Shouliang was thereafter made the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (headquartered at Xingyuan). (His adoptive brother/cousin Yang Shouzhong (楊守忠) succeeded him at Jinshang.)
As military governor of Shannan West.
One of the immediate concerns that Yang Shouliang had was with one of his subordinates, Wang Jian the prefect of Li Prefecture (利州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), whom Yang feared for his might in battle. Yang made several summons of Wang to report to the circuit headquarters at Xingyuan, but Wang, fearing that Yang would take actions against him, refused. Instead, Wang attacked Lang Prefecture (閬州, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), seized it, and claimed the title of defender of Lang. He also gathered more troops and supplies around him, making it even more difficult for Yang to exercise control over him.
By 888, Wang was locked in a campaign with Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and could not achieve victory over Chen. He petitioned then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor, who was supported by Yang Fugong), who had previously grudges against Chen and Chen's brother, the eunuch Tian Lingzi, whom Chen was protecting, for the imperial government to be involved in the campaign. The imperial government, in response, sent the chancellor Wei Zhaodu to command the campaign against Chen, while making Yang, Wang, and Wang's ally Gu Yanlang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) Wei's assistants in the campaign. However, Yang's actual involvement in the campaign, if any, was not clearly stated in historical accounts. (By 891, the imperial government had given up on the campaign, but Wang then proceeded and defeated Chen, seizing Xichuan Circuit.)
Also by 891, Emperor Zhaozong and Yang Fugong had had a falling out, as Emperor Zhaozong despised Yang Fugong for his control of the palace. Yang Fugong particularly had an enmity with Emperor Zhaozong's maternal uncle Wang Gui (王瓌), and when Emperor Zhaozong wanted to make Wang Gui a military governor, Yang Fugong initially refused, causing even more tension between Yang Fugong and Wang Gui. Yang Fugong thus devised a plan to get rid of Wang Gui. He had Wang Gui made the military governor of Qiannan Circuit (黔南). (It is unclear where the headquarters of Qiannan Circuit was located, and, as the modern historian Bo Yang noted, it could have been a circuit that merely existed on paper that Yang Fugong created to get rid of Wang Gui.) As Wang Gui went through Shannan West Circuit on the way to his post, he was taking a ferry across a river at Jibo Ford (吉柏津, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), Yang Shouliang had the ferry scuttled, such that Wang Gui and all his family and staff members drowned. Emperor Zhaozong knew that this was Yang Fugong's idea, and his hatred for Yang Fugong intensified. He subsequently tried to make Yang Fugong the eunuch monitor of the army of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), but Yang Fugong refused, claiming that he was ill and wanted to retire. Emperor Zhaozong subsequently approved of his retirement.
In Yang Fugong's retirement, he met often with Yang Shouxin, who was then the commander of the Yushan Camp (玉山營). This led to rumors and accusations that Yang Fugong and Yang Shouxin were planning a coup against Emperor Zhaozong. In winter 891, Emperor Zhaozong acted preemptively, ordering the imperial guard commanders Li Shunjie (李順節, who had previously been an adoptive son of Yang Fugong's with the name Yang Shouli (楊守立)) and Li Shoujie (李守節) to attack Yang Fugong's mansion. When the chancellor Liu Chongwang subsequently arrived to encourage the imperial guards to attack, the Yangs' guards abandoned them. Yang Fugong and Yang Shouxin fled to Shannan West Circuit, and there, they, along with Yang Shouliang, Yang Shouzhong, and other adoptive sons/nephews of Yang Fugong's Yang Shouzhen (楊守貞) the military governor of Longjian Circuit (龍劍, headquartered in modern Mianyang) and Yang Shouhou (楊守厚) the prefect of Mian Prefecture (in modern Mianyang) in rising against the imperial government.
In resistance to the imperial government and Li Maozhen.
Initially, Yang Shouliang tried to attack and seize Dongchuan, which was then under the rule of Gu Yanlang's brother and successor Gu Yanhui, but was repelled by the joint forces of Xichuan and Dongchuan. When he tried to go through Jin Prefecture to attack Chang'an, he was intercepted and repelled by Feng Xingxi at Jin. In spring 892, five nearby military governors — Li Maozhen of Fengxiang, Wang Xingyu of Jingnan, Han Jian of Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), Wang Xingyue (王行約, Wang Xingyu's brother) of Kuangguo Circuit (匡國, headquartered in modern Weinan as well), and Li Maozhuang (李茂莊, Li Maozhen's brother) of Tianxiong (天雄, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu) — apparently seeing this as an excellent opportunity to annex the Yangs' territory, submitted a joint petition requesting permission to attack the Yangs and requesting that Li Maozhen be put in command of the operations. Emperor Zhaozong, believing that if Li Maozhen took over the Yangs' territory, he would be even harder to control, ordered mediation, but no one accepted imperial mediation. Subsequently, Emperor Zhaozong felt compelled to agree with Li Maozhen's wishes, and so formally declared Li Maozhen the commander of the operations against the Yangs. Meanwhile, Yang Shouliang also entered into an alliance with Yang Sheng (楊晟), a former follower of Chen's and Tian's who was holding out at Peng Prefecture (彭州, in modern Chengdu) after their defeat, but the alliance did not yield results in subsequent battles with Wang Jian. Indeed, when Yang Shouliang sent his adoptive sons Yang Zishi (楊子實), Yang Ziqian (楊子遷), and Yang Zizhao (楊子釗) to aid Yang Sheng, the three of them, seeing that Yang Shouliang appeared to be headed for defeat, surrendered to Wang.
In fall 892, Li Maozhen captured Xingyuan. Yang Shouliang, along with Yang Fugong, Yang Shouxin, Yang Shouzhen, Yang Shouzhong, and another follower of Yang Fugong's, Man Cun (滿存), fled to Lang Prefecture. Wang Jian then sent his officer Hua Hong to attack them at Lang, and Hua defeated them but did not dislodge them. However, in fall 894, Li Maozhen attacked them at Lang and forced them to flee again — and this time, Yang Shouliang was only described as having fled with Yang Fugong and Yang Shouxin. They tried to go through Mount Shang (商山, in modern Shangluo, Shaanxi) to flee to Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) to join Hedong's military governor Li Keyong, but when they got to Qianyuan (乾元, in modern Shangluo), they were captured by Han's troops and delivered to Han. When Yang Shouliang saw that 800 of Han's guards were formerly his soldiers, he stated to Han, "They were among those whom I treated well. None of them was willing to die for me. For you, Lord, to keep them around merely wastes your textiles and food. It is better to kill them." Han agreed. Yang Shouliang then asked to get a chance to plead his case with Emperor Zhaozong, and Han delivered him, Yang Fugong, and Yang Shouxin to Chang'an. However, when Emperor Zhaozong interrogated Yang Shouliang, he could not say anything. Emperor Zhaozong then had them executed.

Library consortium

A library consortium is a group of libraries who partner to coordinate activities, share resources, and combine expertise. The International Coalition of Library Consortia is an informal discussion group of such consortia. Library consortia offer significant advantages to increasingly strapped libraries. The sharing of resources, and collaboration on shared goals often enable libraries to deliver higher quality services than they would be able to deliver on their own.
Inter-library loan is a system that allows for libraries to borrow and share materials across a wide variety of topics as well as vast geographic locations. It is the most common use of cooperation between libraries as well as within specific consortia. Consortia can grow into something that covers much larger ground than a simple inter-library loan agreement. Many consortia within the United States have ventured further and developed integrated library systems, or ILS. Examples of these integrated systems include; OhioLINK, comprising 88 academic libraries in Ohio, TexShare, and Northern Lights Library Network of Minnesota, which incorporates over 300 libraries within the state, Orbis Cascade Alliance in the Northwestern United States, The Alberta Library in Alberta, the MCIT Library Consortium in India, and the Abilene Library Consortium in West Texas.. 
There are many benefits for libraries that wish to create or join consortia. Though many have fees for entry, in the end the library finds itself saving a great deal on funding by sharing resources with other members of the consortia. Also, a single libraries collection will greatly increase much faster than staying solitary. Additionally, the creation and utilization of inter-library cooperation has the ability to greatly improve communication and relationships across vast fields and can encourage cross-discipline cooperation as well as collaborations.

Hannah (1849 shipwreck)

The brig Hannah transported emigrants to :Canada during the Irish Famine. She is known for the terrible circumstances of her 1849 shipwreck, in which the captain and two officers left the sinking ship aboard the only lifeboat, leaving passengers and the rest of the crew to fend for themselves.
Sailing career.
"Hannah" was built at Norton, New Brunswick, Canada in 1826 and registered at Maryport in 1840. She was owned by Samuel Shaw and others. Her captain was John Briggs. She brought immigrants to Canada during the Irish Famine, arriving in Quebec from Sligo with passengers in July 1847.
Shipwreck in 1849.
"Hannah" was transporting more Irish immigrants fleeing the famine from Warrenpoint and Newry to Quebec City, when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on 29 April 1849, resulting in, as well as can be ascertained, 49 deaths.
The "Hannah" set sail from Newry, Ireland on 3 April 1849 with a crew of 12 under its 23-year-old master, Curry Shaw, transporting mainly agricultural labourers and their families. The exact number of passengers is difficult to determine as the ship's list was lost, but it was around 180. According to the documentary "Famine and Shipwreck, An Irish Odyssey", ship's doctor William Graham later accused Shaw of several times slipping into the bunks of unmarried young women during the voyage.
The ship encountered "heavy winds, and a quantity of floating ice" on 27 April. At 4 am on the night of 29 April, the "Hannah" struck a "reef of ice" which punched a hole in the hull.
When they found that there was no hope of saving the ship, Shaw ordered the ship's carpenter to hammer shut the after hatch, trapping the passengers below, but another seaman wrenched it open. Shaw and his first and second officers then fled in the only lifeboat. Dr. Graham asserted that he swam after them, but was held at bay by Shaw swinging a cutlass.
The remaining crewmen helped the passengers onto an ice floe next to the bow. The ship sank in 40 minutes. A strong gale was blowing, and there was sleet. Some went down with the "Hannah", others slipped and fell into the water, while some who did make it safely to the ice later perished from the cold. Ann McGinn (or McGenn) found and gathered together her six children, only to have them all perish. John Murphy left his twin boys on the ice to search for his infant daughter. Miraculously, not only did he find her, but she survived being immersed in the frigid water. Sadly, however, the ice holding his boys drifted away. In all, 49 were ascertained to have died.
The barque "Nicaragua", under the command of Captain William Marshall, appeared the next day and picked up either 127 or 129 survivors. "The Guardian" of 11 June 1849 reported 49 dead and 127 rescued, a total of 176 – "the total number supposed to be embarked", but this may exclude the three officers who abandoned ship. The same article also lists 159 passengers and an unspecified number of daughters of an Ann Lennox. Captain Marshall compiled a slightly different list that includes ten passengers not found on the "Guardian"s tally and omits four that are. Marshall later transferred a number of survivors to other ships: 28 to the barque "Broom", 17 to the barque "Lord Byron", 22 to the barque "Aldebaran", and 20 to the "Port of Glasgow". He arrived in Quebec City with the remainder on 10 or 14 May. Dr. Graham later died in a Quebec hospital.
Shaw and the other two officers were rescued by the "Margaret Pollock" and reached Quebec. The "Ballina Chronicle" reported that a charge was laid against the three "of their being guilty of one of the most revolting acts of inhumanity that can be conceived." However, according to "Famine and Shipwreck, An Irish Odyssey", Shaw successfully defended himself by casting doubt on the testimony of Graham and others, and escaped punishment.
Documentary films.
A Northern Ireland documentary titled "The Ice Emigrants" deals with the tragedy and aired on the BBC in February 2011. Journalist Brian McKenna has produced another documentary of the incident called "Famine and Shipwreck, An Irish Odyssey", which was broadcast on 17 March 2011 on CBC Television.

Château Saint-Jeannet

The Château Saint-Jeannet is a notable French château located in the Côte d'Azur, about northwest of the city of Nice.
Nomenclature.
Prior to major renovations completed in 2009, it was known as the Château de la Gaude, because it is situated in the village of La Gaude, just south of Saint-Jeannet proper. However, as renovations neared completion, the name was changed to that of the more widely known Saint-Jeannet with the intention of increasing tourism to the area.
History.
Tradition holds that the site was used as a Templar fortress as early the 9th and 10th centuries. 
However, the earliest known construction on the château hill can only be dated to the 11th century. 
Written records of a château on the site date to the 13th century. Since that time, it has been effectively destroyed and rebuilt several times.
The most recent renovation recovered evidence of the design of that earliest fort, and has attempted to echo it in the placement of the road, outer walls, and observatory tower.
A book has been printed on the subject of the château's history, and it goes into much greater detail.

In 1969, Carver was elected to the Peoria City Council. After four years on City Council, Carver was elected Mayor of Peoria on April 3, 1973. He was re-elected on April 5, 1977. During his second term in office, he served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors 1979-80 and President of the National Conference of Republican Mayors In 1980, he was a candidate to be United States Senator from Illinois, but lost the Republican primary to Dave O'Neal. He was re-elected to a third term as Mayor of Peoria on April 7, 1981, and subsequently held that office until 1984.
On April 14, 1978, the United State Carter named Carver to a member of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernal Affairs, and on June 17, 1981, President of the United States Ronald Reagan named Carver a member of the President's Commission on Housing, a position he held until 1984. On August 11, 1984, President Reagan nominated Carver to be Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller). Carver subsequently held this office until 1988.
Upon leaving government service in 1988, Carver became the President of ZF Industries while continuing to own Carver Lumber Company. He became President and CEO of MST America in January 1995. From November 1998 to April 2000, he was President and CEO of RPP America. He was a member of the Board of Directors of Competitive Technologies, Inc. from 2000 to 2007.

Maxberg specimen

The Maxberg specimen () is a fossil of the prehistoric bird "Archaeopteryx", discovered in 1956 in Germany. It takes its name from the Maxberg Museum, where it was exhibited for a number of years.
The "Archaeopteryx" specimen is, as of 2011, one of only ten body fossils ever found, but has been missing since the death of its last known owner, Eduard Opitsch, in 1991. It is conventionally referred to as the third specimen.
History.
Discovery and the first owner.
The Maxberg specimen was discovered in 1956 by two workers, Ernst Fleisch and Karl Hinterholzinger, in a quarry between Solnhofen and Langenaltheim, Bavaria, eight decades after the previous discovery in 1874/1875, the Berlin specimen. The workers however did not recognise the significance of the find, mistaking it for an unimportant crayfish, "Mecochirus longimanatus", and the pieces remained stored in a hut for the following two years.
In 1958, Eduard Opitsch, owner of the quarry, allowed the fossil to be taken away by visiting geologist Klaus Fesefeldt who believed it was some vertebrate and sent it to the University of Erlangen where paleontologist Professor Florian Heller identified it correctly and further prepared it. Opitsch, described by contemporaries as having had a difficult personality, attempted to sell the specimen to the highest bidder remarking: "if such things are found only once every hundred years, nothing will be given away for free". The Freie Universität Berlin offered 30,000 Deutschmark; in response the Bavarian institutions tried to preserve the specimen for their own "Bundesland" by outbidding them. In negotiations with Princess Therese zu Oettingen-Spielberg of the "Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie und Geologie" Opitsch, though never demanding an exact amount, had already vaguely indicated a price of about 40,000 DM. The BSP was willing to pay this but hesitant to compensate for the fact that any sum would be taxed at 40% as company profits. The tax collectors did not allow an exemption to be made for this special case. As a result an irritated Opitsch in August 1965 suddenly broke off negotiations and declined all further offers.
Display and withdrawal.
For a number of years, the find was displayed at the local Maxberg Museum. In 1974 Opitsch allowed high-quality casts to be made on the occasion of an exhibition by the Senckenberg Museum dedicated to "Archaeopteryx", but immediately afterwards he removed it from public display altogether. Instead, he stored it in his private residence in near-by Pappenheim declining access to the specimen to all scientists. He rejected a proposal to further prepare the slabs.
Opitsch had become more defensive about the fossil after an announcement of another specimen in 1973. This was the Eichstätt specimen, which was much more complete and also transpired to have already been discovered in 1951, five years before the Maxberg. He felt that the large attention for this new specimen was intended to deprecate his own. Attempts were made to gain permission to show the specimen in exhibitions, but Opitsch always refused the requests. In 1984 Peter Wellnhofer, a renowned expert on "Archaeopteryx", attempted to gather together all specimens and experts on the subject in Eichstätt but Opitsch ignored his request and the conference proceeded without the Maxberg specimen — the London and Berlin specimens however were absent too, the former because seen as too valuable by the British Museum of Natural History, the latter as it was about to be displayed in a surprise exhibition in Tokyo, together with a visit of the Berlin "Brachiosaurus" to Japan.
Disappearance.
When Eduard Opitsch died in February 1991, the Maxberg specimen was not found in his house by his only heir, a nephew entering the building a few weeks after the death of his uncle who was the sole inhabitant. Witnesses claim to have seen the specimen stored under his bed shortly before he died. Opitsch's marble headstone at the cemetery of Langenaltheim depicts a gilded engraving modelled after the specimen, which led to the rumour that he had taken it to his grave. Another theory is that the specimen was sold secretly. The case of the lost specimen was even investigated by the Bavarian police after the heir reported it stolen in July 1991, but no further evidence of its whereabouts was found. Raimund Albersdörfer, a German fossil dealer who was involved in the 2009 purchase of the long-missing Daiting Specimen, believes, as do others, that the specimen is not lost but rather in private possession and will resurface eventually. As a result of all this the specimen has no official inventory number.
The disappearance of the Maxberg specimen has led to renewed calls to protect fossil finds by law. The laws in this regard would be a matter of the federal states in Germany. Bavaria, to this date, is the only "Bundesland" having no laws protecting such finds. However, the federal government has declared the Maxberg specimen a national cultural heritage, "national wertvolles Kulturgut", in 1995, meaning it cannot be exported without permission.
In 2009, the value of a high-quality "Archaeopteryx" specimen was estimated to be in excess of three million Euro.
Specimen.
The Maxberg specimen, like all "Archaeopteryx" exemplars except the so-called "Daiting", shows body feathers. The specimen was formally described in 1959 by Florian Heller. Heller had roentgen and UV-pictures made by the photographic institute of Wilhelm Stürmer. The specimen consists of a slab and counterslab, mainly showing a torso with some feather impressions, lacking both head and tail. The roentgen pictures proved that parts of the skeleton still remained hidden inside the stone. The fossil was studied for a time by researchers before Opitsch removed it from public exhibition, among them John Ostrom.
It was determined by a geologist that the quarry that produced the Maxberg specimen had also produced the London specimen, which was found almost one hundred years earlier, in 1861. However, the Maxberg example was found almost seven metres lower than the London one.

Roman Catholicism in Greenland

The Roman Catholic Church in Greenland is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. There are very few Catholics in this overwhelmingly Protestant territory. There are 50 registered Catholics and only approximately 4 native Greenlander Catholics out of a population of 57,000. They are part of the only Catholic parish in Greenland, in Nuuk, the island's capital. The whole island is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen, Denmark.
Catholicism was introduced to Greenland in the 11th century with the help of the King of Norway, establishing the first churches in the western hemisphere, and after much effort the people of Greenland received a bishop. The church thrived with the Norse colony which saw its peak in the 1300s, and had an active relationship with Scandinavia and the European continent; the church also participated in the European exploration of the Americas. The abandonment of the colony around 1450 ended any church presence in Greenland and the Protestant Reformation in Denmark effectively shut Greenland from any Catholic presence until the 20th century, when freedom of religion was declared and a small permanent Catholic presence reestablished.
History.
Middle Ages.
Catholicism was introduced to Greenland about 1000 AD. Leif Ericson, son of Eric the Red, visited Nidaros (modern Trondheim, Norway) and converted to Christianity while at the court of the Norwegian king. He then returned to his father's farm in Brattahlid, southern Greenland, and brought two priests sent by King Olaf Tryggvason. Some scholars have hypothesized that, like the catholic diocese in Iceland, Greenland may have had an unofficial bishop first, specifically "Eric the Bishop" who was sent to Greenland in the year 1112, though others claim he was a missionary bishop, and there is no record of his return. A Bishop named Erik Gupson was supposedly a member of an expedition in 1121 to re-locate the eastern coast of North America, which had been discovered 100 years earlier. The colonists were supposedly eager to have a bishop after Eric failed to arrive, and leading citizen Socke Thoresson sent Einar Sockesson to the court of the Norwegian king to request a bishop. After Sockesson brought gifts of ivory and walrus hide, and a "white bear" for the king, the king appointed Arnold, one of his chief clerks, to be Greenland's first bishop. The first diocese, titled Gardar, was officially established in 1124, and Greenland had the first known churches in the western hemisphere.
At the height of the settlement's extent, there were five thousand Norse Catholics in two settlements. Sixteen parishes and churches were founded along with several monasteries and a convent for Benedictine nuns. Churches built in Greenland were not independent properties owned by the church, but were built on farmland given by local farmers and other chief villagers, and collected a part of the tithes given to the church and sent them to the archbishop in Nidaros. Attempts were made in nearby Scandinavian countries to take control of the local churches, and Norway's control of Greenland in 1261 may have put pressure on local churches to become independent, just as they had in Norway. Bishop Arnes in 1281 contributed to Peter's Pence and the expenses of the Crusades with walrus tusks and polar bear hides, and tithing continued in later years by selling raw materials for gold and silver. The introduction of Christianity is thought to have caused a major cultural break from the past, introducing many mainland European ideas and practices, such as the building of large churches and cathedrals, and this connection was maintained by the fact that the bishops appointed to Greenland were from Scandinavia, and not locals. At least until 1327, the Vatican made an official receipt of six years worth of tithes from Greenland. Sixteen to eighteen bishops held the title of Bishop of Gardar during the diocese history, though few are thought to have actually resided in Greenland. In 1341, the bishop of Bergen sent a representative named Ivar Bardarson, who returned to Norway with detailed lists of all church properties, which is thought by some to indicate the church was attempting to become more independent in Greenland.
Reformation era.
Around the year 1450, the Norse departed or died out from starvation and fighting with the Inuit, and the church ceased to exist there. In 1519, Pope Leo X named Vincent Peterson Kampe bishop of Gardar. In a letter sent in that year on June 20, Kampe was named the bishop "in titulum", and the letter also stated that the diocese itself was vacant because of "the unfaithful". Also on the same date, the Pope stated that Gardar had been deprived of a bishop for 30 years. It is therefore thought by some experts that the bishop was treated as the head of the diocese until 1530, and after that as just a title. When he died in 1530, no further bishops were appointed to the Greenland diocese. For many years, it was thought that the diocese of Gardar was not really occupied by a Catholic bishop, but was a title given to a bishop who may not actually have been in Greenland. After the last Norse colony in North America was destroyed, the Catholic Archbishop of Trondenheim, Eric Walkendorf attempted to send assistance, but to no avail. The Viking populations are thought to have been absorbed by native Eskimos and Catholicism extinguished.
Modern times.
Greenland was part of the "Apostolic Prefecture of the Article Pole" based in Norway from 1855 to 1868. Since that time, Greenland has been part of the Danish Catholic Church hierarchy, first the Apostolic Prefecture of Copenhagen, which was raised to a Vicariate Apostolic, and later a full Catholic Diocese. The territory was under the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Copenhagen in the early 20th century. Catholic priests have been visiting Greenland since 1930, after the bishop of Copenhagen, Benedictine Theodore Suhr, received permission from the Vatican to ask permission of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate to missionize there. Catholic priests have also served with the United States military as chaplains in the 20th century. State enforced Lutheranism was kept in place until 1953 when religious liberty was declared. In the summer of 1980, the Little Sisters of Jesus established a fraternity in Nuuk with three sisters. Denmark has requested UNESCO acknowledge the ruins of the episcopal residence at Gardar as part of a World Heritage Site. In 2007, a global environmental summit was held in Nuuk at their Catholic church, which was attended by Catholic, Orthodox and United Nations officials, with the approval of Pope Benedict XVI.

Leahy-Smith America Invents Act

The Leahy–Smith America Invents Act (AIA) is a United States federal statute that was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on September 16, 2011. The law represents the most significant change to the U.S. patent system since 1952, and closely resembles previously proposed legislation in the Senate in its previous session (Patent Reform Act of 2009).
Named for its lead sponsors, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), the Act switches the U.S. patent system from a "first to invent" to a "first inventor to file" system, eliminates interference proceedings, and develops post-grant opposition. Its central provisions went into effect on September 16, 2012 and on March 16, 2013.
Provisions.
First to file and grace period.
The law switched the U.S. rights to a patent from the previous "first-to-invent" system to a "first inventor-to-file" system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. The law also expanded the definition of prior art used in determining patentability. Actions and prior art that bar patentability under the Act include public use, sales, publications, and other disclosures available to the public anywhere in the world as of the filing date, other than publications by the inventor within one year of filing (inventor's "publication-conditioned grace period"), whether or not a third party also files a patent application. The law also notably expanded prior art to include foreign offers for sale and public uses. Applicants that do not publish their inventions prior to filing receive no grace period.
Proceedings at the U.S. Patent Office for resolving priority contests among near-simultaneous inventors who both file applications for the same invention ("interference proceedings") were eliminated, because priority under the Act is determined based on filing date. An administrative proceeding—called a “derivation” proceeding, similar to that currently used within some interference proceedings—is provided to ensure that the first person to file the application is actually an original inventor, and that the application was not derived from another inventor.
The AIA refers to the new regime as "First-Inventor-to-File (FITF)". This new regime operates differently from the "First-to-Invent" (FTI) regime previously in effect in the U.S. and the various "First-to-File" (FTF) regimes in place in the rest of the world. Different outcomes can occur under each of these three different regimes, depending on whether and how two different inventors publish or file patent applications.
Opposition procedures.
The Act revised and expanded post-grant opposition procedures. The Act retained existing ex parte reexamination; added preissuance submissions by third parties; expanded "inter partes" reexamination, which was renamed "inter partes" review; and added post-grant review.
Additional changes.
The America Invents Act included the following changes:
Savings from small entity (prior to act, based on small entity fees & includes 15% surcharge), to micro entity (post act):
% Net Savings for the new Micro Entity over Prior Small Entity Inventor = "42%"
Legislative history.
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced similar bill in the United States Senate on January 25, 2011, with seven co-sponsors (also members of the Judiciary Committee) that include Senators Coons (D-DE), Grassley (R-IA), Hatch (R-UT), Klobuchar (D-MN), Kyl (R-AZ), Lieberman (I-CT), and Sessions (R-AL). The Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bill, and the United States Senate passed it March 8, 2011, by a vote of 95–5. H.R. 1249: was passed by the House Judiciary Committee on April 14, 2011, by a vote of 32-3.
The House of Representatives passed their version of the Act () on June 23, 2011 by a vote of 304-117, with sixty-seven Republicans and fifty Democrats voting against the bill.
On September 8, 2011, the Senate approved the House version by an 89-9 bipartisan vote. On September 16, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law at a ceremony at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Northern Virginia.
Policy debate.
Proponents of the bill argued that it may even the playing field by removing the tricks a well-funded infringer can currently use against a startup owning patented technology.
Proponents of the bill suggested that technology companies are subject to an unprecedented wave of patent lawsuits, stifling innovation and creating an overburdened and lethargic patent system. Advocates for the America Invents Act argued that it will create jobs, bolster innovation, streamline the patent system, reduce patent litigation, and keep the U.S. competitive globally.
Opponents of the Bill contended that it will lead to results similar to other nations' patent systems on which the bill is modeled — market incumbents will become further entrenched, the rate of startup formation will fall to levels in other countries, and access to angel and venture capital will fall to the levels of other countries, as described in the Impact of the Changes section below. A startup that relies on patents for protection from competitive risk, would, under the AIA, lose the protections of the previous regime to assemble the capital, strategic partners, and time for R&D and testing. The startup, exposed to the risk of copying by an established player in the marketplace, will be unable to attract venture capital, and so will lack the financial resources necessary to commercialize the startup’s invention and grow the company. The weakening of patent protection diminishes incentives for investments and development.
In addition, opponents of the bill pointed out that the proposed revisions create greater options for accused infringers, and weaken the rights of patentees, and that patent reform should remain in the hands of the court system. Opponents argue that patent reform should be confined to administrative reforms at the USPTO. The time, effort and money that will be spent after issuance under the AIA on "inter partes" review and post-grant review would be better spent improving initial examination. According to patent attorney and reexamination specialist Taraneh Maghame, “the root of the problem trying to be addressed by the reexamination process could be better solved if quality patents are issued in the first instance.”
First Inventor to File and grace period.
Proponents of the AIA submitted that it would simplify the application process and bring U.S. patent law into better harmony with the patent law of other countries, most of which operate on the "first-to-file" system. Proponents also claimed that it would eliminate costly interference proceedings at the USPTO and reduce U.S. applicants’ disadvantages in seeking patent rights outside of the United States.
Opponents contended that a "first inventor-to-file" system favored larger firms with well-established internal patenting procedures, patent committees and in-house attorneys over small business inventors. They claimed that, in a novel and perverse way found in no other country, the Act would weaken patent protection only in America. Opponents also submitted that it would (i) cause loss of patent rights due to new prior art published after the invention date but before the filing date, (ii) weaken the current grace period so it cannot be relied on, compelling inventors to behave as if there were no grace period, (iii) replace "interferences" with costly derivation proceedings, which are generally even more expensive than interferences, (iv) create a “race to the Patent Office” with every new idea, increasing the number of patent applications filed, with the attendant costs in attorney fees and diversion of company personnel to patent application preparation, (v) increase examination backlogs at the USPTO, (vi) do nothing to reduce U.S. applicants’ costs of acquiring patents outside of the U.S., and (vii) decrease average patent quality.
It was found that the proposed new regime behaves more like a new and unique kind of patent system with characteristics of both the FTI and FTF regimes, rather than a harmonized system sharing characteristics of both.
Opponents pointed out that under First-to-Invent, a company with extensive resources could choose to practice First-to-File, by simply racing to the patent office as soon as every invention is conceived, eliminating any need to keep records of invention conception. Some pointed out that the changes switch the U.S. from a “first to conceive” system to a “first to reduce to practice.” Meanwhile, a company with limited resources could still use First-to-Invent, only filing patents that matter after funding is obtained. Under First-(Inventor)-to-File, the reverse is not true: all parties, regardless of their resources, must adhere to “race to the patent office”. This places small entities at an enormous disadvantage to large entities.
There was a question of whether changing to FTF would be constitutional. of the Constitution states:
“To promote the Progress of ... useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to ... Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective ... Discoveries.”
The term "inventor" means "the first to invent." "To invent" means "to create something that has not existed before." Therefore, by the standard definitions of our language, adoption of FTF would require amending the constitution. All peer-reviewed papers published in scholarly journals found this or similar problems. For this reason, the new AIA is not a first to file, but a first inventor to file system. It eliminates retrospective analysis of murky "inventorship" arguments between two parties, each who invent independently. Instead, it rewards those who invent, and then file first.
Canada changed from FTI to FTF in 1989 and experienced a measurable "adverse effect on domestic-oriented industries and skewed the ownership structure of patented inventions towards large corporations, away from independent inventors and small businesses." 
Judicial review of reexamination decisions.
Opponents noted that the AIA contained a provision that would deny the right of patent owners to obtain judicial review of adverse USPTO decisions in ex parte patent reexaminations by civil action in district court – a right that has existed under / § 145 since the inception of reexamination in 1980. They contended that abolishing this right will leave direct appeal to the Federal Circuit as the only judicial recourse – an intolerable scenario for patent owners who need to rely on evidence that was unavailable during the administrative appeal stage. Opponents contended that this provision will exacerbate ex parte reexamination abuses by creating an unprecedented end-run around Federal District Courts in potentially all patent disputes. They warned that alleged infringers would simply file ex parte reexamination requests with USPTO, receive a final agency decision subject only to Federal Circuit review, essentially bypassing Federal courts. Opponents feared that given the deference the Federal Circuit must accord the agency ("Zurko"), large number of prospective/alleged infringers would choose this new favorable path to challenge a patent, overwhelming the USPTO, causing much lengthier delays in reexamination and holding up patentees' patent rights for years.
Post-grant opposition.
Advocates argued that allowing a challenge of a patent in the first year after the issuance or reissuance of a patent would improve patent quality by allowing third party inputs. Opponents note that: (a) "inter partes" review under the Bill allows a third party to challenge the validity of any claim(s) in a patent *after* the first year; (b) re-exams are in fact used, not as an alternative to litigation, but rather as a supplement to litigation. In FY2008, 62% of current inter partes re-exams and 30% of ex parte re-exams were simultaneously in litigation; (c) predatory corporations can and do file multiple post-grant oppositions against startup companies for the purpose of inflicting financial pain and through this practice have successfully extracted patent licensing and purchase agreements on favorable terms; (d) the existing "inter partes" process in a contested case now takes 34 to 53 months for an un-appealed reexam (assuming no “rework” by the patent office and no secondary appeals to the BPAI, the Federal Circuit, or the Supreme Court), and 5 to 8 years for appealed cases. When Congress created "inter partes" reexamination, it directed the USPTO to conduct these reexaminations with "special dispatch." The Bill expands the existing "inter partes" procedure, adding
discovery and a hearing in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Consequently, under the Bill, pendency of the "inter partes" procedure will likely increase, despite the legislative fiat requiring 18 month disposition;
and (e) the Bill all but requires a federal district court to stay a patent infringement suit copending with an "inter partes" review. Because of the enormous costs and long pendency of "inter partes" review, the grant of a stay in a copending infringement suit could effectively be "game over" for the patent owner.
Post Grant Review is available only if the challenger has not already initiated a civil action in District Court. Post Grant Review proceedings are to be conducted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which will replace the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on September 16, 2012 for proceedings that commence on or after that date. Post Grant Review proceedings may be terminated either by settlement or by decision of the Board. There is also estoppel associated with the challenger at the USPTO, the District Courts and the International Trade Commission (ITC) in asserting invalidity on any ground that could have been reasonably raised during Post Grant Review.
Impact of the changes.
The use of reexamination, or the threat of its use, in patent infringement litigation is common. “of the reexamination process has, in the view of some, become more the rule than the exception. Reportedly it has become ‘standard procedure’ that a defendant in patent litigation ‘take an aggressive stance by saying it plans to request a re-exam on the patent-in-suit or even all’ of the plaintiff's patents. The threat of reexamination is then used as leverage in licensing negotiations, intimidating patent-holders into settling out of court for lower amounts than those to which the value of their patents might entitle them.” Reexamination requests from companies accused of patent infringement have recently more than tripled. “Ironically, Congress intended that the reexamination process should have just the opposite effect: "Patent office reexamination will greatly reduce, if not end, the threat of legal costs being used to 'blackmail' such [patent- holders into allowing patent infringements or being forced to license their patents for nominal fees." 
Critics argued that the AIA would prevent startup companies, a potent source of inventions, from raising capital and being able to commercialize their inventions. Typically, an inventor will have a sufficient conception of the invention and funding to file a patent application only after receiving investment capital. Before receiving investor funding, the inventor must have already conceived the invention, proven its functionality, and done sufficient market research to propose a detailed business plan. Investors will then scrutinize the business plan and evaluate competitive risk, which is inherently high for startup companies as new entrants into the market. Opponents of the Bill contended that, if the bill becomes law, venture funding will be diverted to less risky investments.
Proponents of the Bill argued that revision of both post grant opposition and interference will help US inventors. They pointed out that a patent that has survived a post-grant review will be stronger than one without. Neither side put forward a cost-benefit balance showing that the added strength of these patents will compensate for the loss of access to venture capital, though the venture capitalists that have opined on the likely balance have concluded that the post-grant review will reduce access to capital more than it increases patent strength.
Proponents also argued that the Act provides numerous benefits to small businesses such as fast-track patent examination, fee reductions, and expanded prior user rights.
Other issues.
Critics of the bill expressed concern, that the administration has been guided by the same people who previously lobbied for patent reform on behalf of IBM and Microsoft, and that their appointments were a violation of the Obama Administration's "Revolving Door Ban". USPTO Director David Kappos represented IBM, Marc Berejka (Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce) lobbied on behalf of Microsoft, and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, to whom the USPTO reported until Locke was made Ambassador to China on August 1, 2011, also has extensive ties to Microsoft.
Opponents raised the concern that the bill could cause the USA to lose its leadership position in innovation, particularly as a result of the adverse impact on small companies, who were unrepresented in the negotiations leading up to this bill. Also, critics complained that this bill will not do enough to curb “non-practising entities” from engaging in purportedly overly aggressive behaviors.
Critics pointed out that the new bill fails to address a glaring issue that will seemingly continue to exist under the new system: the extensive backlog of existing patent applications. Instead of hiring more examiners to process this backlog, "...Congress chose to multiply the alternative dispute-resolution procedures at the PTO, giving the office more work to do without a guarantee of more money. The result was a muddle as well as a missed opportunity."

She is the subject of a children's book "Mali Under the Night Sky." Her multidisciplinary works explore the relationship between art, transformation, and communal healing.
Biography.
Kouanchao was born in Savannakhet, Laos in 1971 and resettled in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979 with her parents and four siblings as refugees from the Laotian Civil War. She attended South High School in Minneapolis in the 1980s. At the University of Minnesota, Kouanchao received a BA in 1998 in Fine Arts, with minors in Chinese and East Asian Studies.
She has received funding and support for her art from the Minnesota State Arts Board and the Jerome Foundation. Her work has been presented in Minnesota, Washington, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Arizona and California. Murals and mosaics she has worked on include "Hand to Heart","Harmony", "People, Places, Connection","Integrity", "Sol y Mariposa", and "Faces of the Future, Reflect Our Past".
She serves on the national advisory committee for Legacies of War, a
multidisciplinary project established to raise awareness of the US Secret
War in Laos, and well as to advocate for further U.S. support for the
removal of American cluster bombs and increased aid for cluster bomb
survivors.
In 2010 she received an Asian Pacific American Leadership Award from the Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans for her work as a visual artist. She also received an Excellence in Visual Arts Award from the 2010 Lao Artists Festival in Elgin, Illinois.
Kouanchao became the last Lao American to receive an Archibald Bush Artist Fellowship in 2010. Since it began in 1976, 431 artists from Minnesota and the Dakotas received funds from the fellowship program, one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Her fellowship plan includes continued work on her series "Displacement: Never Free" which examines the lives of Cambodian and Southeast Asian American deportees and the impacts of US policies on their families.
Kouanchao also created the series "Living Spirits: Collateral Bodies" incorporating traditional Southeast Asian spirit houses and paper lanterns with modern photographic techniques to examine social and political issues.
Her work appears as the cover art for "Feminist Waves, Feminist Generations: Life Stories from the Academy, 1964-2000" from the University of Minnesota Press in 2007. Her work is also featured in "Wem gehört die Welt? (Who owns the World?)" by Mural Global, published in 2002.
Her childhood served as the basis for a 2010 children's book "Mali Under the Night Sky," by Youme Landowne, published by Cinco Punto Press.

Ten Desires

Gameplay.
The new game mechanics for Ten Desires features divine spirits. These divine spirits are released when enemies are killed, bosses are damaged, and at certain scripted events. The blue spirits add 10 to the player's "score value" (the number of points granted for collecting a point item at the top of the screen), in addition to slightly filling the player's trance gauge (see below). Gray spirits provide a larger increase to the trance gauge and act like additional Point items, giving you the current maximum Point value no matter where they are on the screen. Green spirits add 1 point to the bomb meter, and purple add 1 point to the life meter. Extra lives are awarded at 10 life points for the first life, 15 for the second, 20 for the third, and so on. Bombs are awarded at 10 bomb points regardless of how many are acquired.
Grazing adds to score value as well; every 10 bullets grazed increases score value by 10. Additionally, bosses can be "grazed" as they emit blue (and gray) spirits every few shots, and if one stays close enough to the boss they can absorb all the spirits that it emits. The rate at which spirits spawn is negatively correlated with the distance from the boss; The closer the character is, the faster spirits will spawn. This makes sitting on top of bosses while in trance a highly profitable score return.
At the end of every spell card (with the exception of the last spell card of a boss) the boss emits 1 green spirit, and 1 purple spirit (along with blues and grays).
The Trance gauge consists of zero to three flames that are built up by collecting blue and gray divine spirits. The player begins the game with one flame, and can collect up to a max stock of three. Pressing the 'C' button when all 3 gauges are full will trigger a powerful, 10 second long trance state, where the character gets an upgraded shot type and is not damaged by enemy bullets. While in a trance state, the divine spirits take on a new shape that not only makes them much easier to see, it also makes them worth more. Blue spirits get x10 effectiveness, while purple and green get x2 effectiveness. If a character is struck by an enemy bullet while there is at least one full trance gauge remaining, the trance-state will automatically trigger, with the loss of a life once the timer runs down. The duration of the death trance depends on the amount of gauge collected to that point. In addition, when a trance (whether activated manually or upon receiving damage) expires, the player's trance gauge is reset to 0.
Shooting unfocused yields a higher score rate than shooting while focused. Divine spirits hover in roughly the same place while shrinking in size for approximately ten seconds before disappearing. In addition, they cannot be auto-collected (except by Reimu in Trance Mode). When a "death-trance" is finishing it still deals damage to everything on the screen similar to the way when a character would die normally. It is not possible to deathbomb while at least one gauge of the trance meter is full (that is, when death-trance is possible).
Story.
One day in Gensokyo, a large amount of spirits are being found throughout the city. Reimu, Marisa, Sanae, and Youmu intend to see what is going on. Depending on who you choose, one of them goes out and investigates.
The first place the heroine heads of to is the Netherworld, where spirits often go. While investigating, the heroine encounters Yuyuko Saigyouji. Yuyuko states that she has no idea what the spirits are going around for. The heroine battles with Yuyuko, and Yuyuko is defeated. Yuyuko states that they are no ordinary spirits; they are 'divine spirits'. Yuyuko gives the heroine a hint: the graveyard behind the Myouren Temple. The heroine proceeds to the temple. While looking around, the heroine confronts Kyouko Kasodani, the temple's cleaner. Kyouko is easily defeated, and the heroine goes to the graveyard of the temple. Not too long after, the heroine meets Kogasa Tatara, who asks the heroine to defeat a girl who's guarding the place. Instead, the heroine attacks Kogasa and continues on. Eventually, they meet Yoshika Miyako, the Jiang Shi protecting the mausoleum. Yoshika is ultimately defeated and opens the door to the mausoleum.
Inside, there are way more divine spirits then there were before. The heroine tries to proceed, but encounters Seiga Kaku. Seiga resurrected Yoshika and used her as a guard of the mausoleum. Seiga, with the help of Yoshika, battles the heroine to prevent them from proceeding. However, they are defeated. Seiga states that this temple was built in order to prevent someone from being resurrected. As the heroine goes in further, the heroine finds Soga no Tojiko, who is quickly defeated. Eventually, the heroine encounters Mononobe no Futo. Futo battles the heroine and is defeated. After being defeated, Futo realises that the 'Crown Prince' is being resurrected and quickly goes to see what is going on. The heroine continues in the mausoleum and sees a ton of divine spirits. After a bit of wandering around, the heroine encounters Toyosatomimi no Miko, a Saint who had just been resurrected. The divine spirits were gathering here to see the resurrection of a holy person, the holy person being Miko. The heroine and Miko battle and Miko is defeated.
Some time later, the heroine investigates around the Myouren Temple. After going around, an angry Nue Houjuu comes out. Nue seems to be angry that Miko was resurrected. Nue attacks the heroine, but is easily defeated. After going through some danmaku, the heroine meets Mamizou Futatsuiwa, who claims that Nue sent her here. Mamizou heard that the heroine defeated Nue and Miko. Mamizou decided to have a battle with the heroine to see how powerful she was. In the end, Mamizou is defeated.

Music.
Ten Desires contains different versions for each stage and boss theme: The normal version, heard during normal gameplay and in the Music Room, focuses primarily on the melody and harmony, and contains relatively few background noises compared to Zun's previous compositions. On entering trance mode, the music switches to the second ("Spirit world") version. It is recorded using a lower sampling rate (22050 Hz), and focuses primarily on the rhythm and accompanying voices.
Since they complement each other and have exactly the same length, a "fuller" sound, can be achieved by mixing both versions of each theme together using audio editing software.

Engineering for Change

Engineering for Change (E4C) is an online platform and international community of engineers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, local community advocates and other innovators working to solve global development problems. The organization's founders are the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Engineers Without Borders USA.
Members of the E4C community use the platform's online tools to share knowledge and collaborate. They work together to design and apply technical solutions wherever they see the need. Solutions fall into seven categories on the organization's Web site, and they can include big infrastructural projects such as community water purification and bridge building, or smaller, personal technologies such as bicycle-powered electricity generators and cellphone applications for healthcare.
History.
In 2009, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers created a website to pull together the disparate sources of information on appropriate technology and solutions in global development. The site aggregated information, hosted a library of often little-known technologies, and offered tools to enable collaboration among development teams worldwide. Throughout 2010, the site operated in alpha and then beta with a mostly closed group of users. A public site, at engineeringforchange.info, mirrored some of the content on the test site, but without all of its functionality. IEEE and EWB-USA signed on as partners in time for the public launch on January 4, 2011.
At present, the organization has more than 3000 members. Many of them are also members of the founding organizations, which have a combined membership of more than 500,000.
Solutions Library.
E4C users can post projects they are working on and challenges they are having to gain insight from the wider community. They can use an open-source archive of solutions to development issues that include models for development projects, tested devices and other information gleaned from global organizations. The members can learn how to use their skills in developing countries and resource-poor areas from experts in their fields. They can also track the projects that interest and contribute their own advice and information.
Education.
Education is an important part of Engineering for Change. The Web site provides educational materials on how to design and implement solutions, and an archive of relevant academic programs.

Race Street

Race Street is a 1948 American crime film noir directed by Edwin L. Marin. The drama features George Raft, William Bendix and Marilyn Maxwell.
Plot.
When his bookie pal Hal is killed, nightclub owner Dan Gannin intends to do something about it. His police pal Lt. Runson warns him not to take the law into his own hands.
Also concerned is Dan's girlfriend, Robbie, a war widow. But when two thugs working for a mob boss blindfold and beat Dan, a disloyal Robbie is also in the room.
It turns out Robbie is not a widow at all but the showgirl ex-wife of the crime kingpin, Phil Dixon, and still working for him. She denies it at first, but Dan recalls recognizing the scent of her perfume while blindfolded.
Lt. Runson tries to provide Dan protective custody, but another bookie betrays Dan to the mob. The lieutenant is about to be shot when Dan intercepts the bullet. He dies as Dixon is placed under arrest.
Reception.
When the film was released, "The New York Times" film critic, Thomas M. Pryor, panned the film, writing, "In "Race Street," a regulation melodrama which opened Saturday at the Mayfair, George Raft is playing a regulation big-time bookie who is harassed by regulation muscle-men. In fact, everything about this dreary exercise in violence is strictly formula, depressingly juvenile and dull...Mr. Raft, an old hand at this sort of thing, handles himself with ease and authority, and William Bendix does a good job as the detective. There is even professional dexterity to the direction, but all this energy is completely wasted on a shoddy, routine story."
Box Office.
The film made a minor profit. It was the last of four films Raft made for RKO.

Compact cars and pickup trucks are available from the start while muscle and sports must be unlocked later in the game. Each model has its own unique selection of body parts, including spoilers, front and rear bumpers, and side skirts. Although all vehicles are fictional, certain combinations of parts can be used to resemble real world vehicles. 
Almost every track featured in the game has static obstacles, such as slaloms, crossovers, and jumps. Also featured are "X" tracks, which contain additional bumps and ramps. Dynamic obstacles will appear as races progress, such as oil and ignitable fuel slicks, as well as wreckage from totaled opponents' vehicles. 
All vehicle customization is unlocked through the in game shop. Every event completed awards the player both experience (EXP) and money. Additional bonuses are awarded for wrecking opponents, setting fast laps, placing in the top three, and leading laps. Earning EXP will eventually level the player up, which unlocks new items from the shop, which are purchased one at a time with money. At certain EXP levels, the player gains free bonuses, such as access to muscle and sports cars.
When in Single Player, the player will face 15 bots, each with a unique vehicle from each category and vinyl layout.
Reception.
Reception of Crash 'N' Burn was mixed. The game was criticized for its monotonous gameplay, difficult-to-grasp controls, and unrealistic physics system.

Lernaeocera branchialis

Lernaeocera branchialis, sometimes called cod worm, is a parasite of marine fish, found mainly in the North Atlantic. It is a marine copepod which starts life as a small pelagic crustacean larvae. It is among the largest of copepods, ranging in size from 2–3 millimetres when it matures as a copepodid larva to more than as an adult.
"Lernaeocera branchialis" is ectoparasitic, which means it is a parasite that lives primarily on the surface of its hosts. It has many life stages, some of which are motile and some of which are sessile. It goes through two parasitic stages, one where it parasites as a secondary host a flounder or lumpsucker, and another stage where it parasites as a primary host a cod or other fishes of the cod family (gadoids). It is a pathogen that negatively impacts the commercial fishing and mariculture of cod-like fish.
Life stages.
The life-cycle of a cod worm involves a complex progression of life stages, including two successive hosts. It comprises "two free-swimming nauplius stages, one infective copepodid stage, four chalimus stages and the adult copepod, each separated by a moult".
The cycle begins with the females laying eggs which hatch into a nauplius, the usual early larval stage of crustaceans. This nauplius moults about 10 minutes after hatching to produce nauplius II, and 48 hours later, nauplius II moults to a copepodid stage. At this point the copepodid is pelagic and free-swimming with an average length of about 0.5 mm.
The next stage is finding a secondary or intermediate host, a demersal fish like a flounder or lumpfish which is often stationary and therefore easy to catch. The copepodid have only a day to find such a fish and attach themselves to its gills.
When they locate such a fish, they capture it with grasping hooks at the front of their body. They penetrate the fish with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then progress via four moults from the naupliar stage to the mature chalimus stage. At this point the males transfer sperm to the females. Both sexes develop swimming setae, detach from the flounder or lumpfish and again swim freely as pelagic organisms.
The female worm still resembles a copepod and is 2 to 3 mm long. She now undergoes another pelagic quest, searching this time for a definitive or primary host. With her fertilised eggs, she looks for a cod or a fish belonging to the same family as cod, such as a haddock or whiting.
When she locates one the worm enters the gill chamber. There she clings to the gills and metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at her rear. These bodies are mostly about 20 mm long, but can measure up to 50 mm. The front part of the worm's body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host's heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops in the shape of antlers or branches on a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, while safely tucked beneath the cod's gill cover, the worm feeds from one end on cod blood while it pumps new offspring out the other end.
Behaviour.
It is not known how "L. branchialis" searches for its fish hosts, but it probably uses chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, and follows physical clues in the water column such as those provided by haloclines and thermoclines.
Effects on fisheries.
The most serious parasitic crustaceans among fish in general are sea lice. However, "L. branchialis" is probably the most serious parasitic crustacean among cod. Infestation reduces the efficiency with which food can be utilised, delaying the development of the gonads. Up to 30% loss in weight can occur, with increases in mortality because of open lesions with loss of blood, and possibly occlusion of vessels or aorta. These can have commercial impacts on wild fisheries, making cod-like fishes more expensive to market. Gadoids, particularly cod, are emerging marine aquaculture species in some North Atlantic countries. "L. branchialis" present potential problems for their successful mariculture.

Le dernier sorcier

Le dernier sorcier ("The Last Sorcerer") is a chamber opera in two acts with music composed by Pauline Viardot to a French libretto by Ivan Turgenev. It was first performed privately on September 20, 1867 at the Villa Turgenev in Baden-Baden and received its first public performance in Weimar on April 8, 1869 (in German translation as "Der letzte Zauberer"). The story revolves around Krakamiche, an old and once-powerful sorcerer whose presence in the woods has upset the elves living there, and a romance between the sorcerer's daughter Stella and Prince Stelio.
Background and first performance.
By the mid-1860s, after her retirement from the stage and living at her villa ("Villa Viardot") in Baden-Baden, Viardot's main activities centered around her teaching, including giving her students experience of performing in small-scale operas in a private setting. Although married, Viardot had long had an intimate friendship with Ivan Turgenev whom she first met when singing in St. Petersburg in 1843. The relationship had continued over the years with Turgenev having extensive stays in Paris, always living close to Viardot and her husband, Louis. When the Viardots went to Baden-Baden in 1863, Turgenev followed shortly thereafter and built his own villa next to theirs. Turgenev and Viardot's collaboration in Baden-Baden produced three operas designed to be performed by her students: "Trop de femmes", "Le dernier sorcier" and "L'ogre".
According to Turgenev scholar Nicholas Žekulin, "Le dernier sorcier" was already mentioned in correspondence in 1859, but does not appear to have been performed until it was revised for Baden-Baden. The first performance of the opera was on September 20, 1867 at the completed but as yet unoccupied Villa Turgenev, where the first performance of "Trop de femmes" had also taken place. Turgenev's friend, Louis Pomey, was Krakamiche for the initial performances. The part was taken by Turgenev for a gala performance on October 20. Marie Hasselmans played Stella. Viardot's daughter, Louise Héritte played the role of Lelio. Other Viardot children were Claudie as the Queen, Marianne as Verveine, and Paul as Perlimpinpin (most of these roles were spoken). Viardot accompanied on piano, the sole instrument in the original score. The audience consisted of invited guests who were primarily from Viardot's circle. They included Giulia Grisi, Garcia, Clara Schumann, Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot, Hermann Levi, and singers Marianne Lüdecke and Albertina Ferlesi. Pierre-Jules Hetzel (who reviewed the production of "Trop de femmes" for the "Journal des Débats", September 13, 1867), a few politicians, and the German Empress Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach also attended. The Empress's enthusiasm not only caused her to bring her husband Kaiser William I along for a subsequent performance, but also led to a special royal command performance on October 17 to celebrate the birthday of the Crown Prince, Friedrich Wilhelm.
Later performance history.
Following a second season of Viardot and Turgenev's privately performed operettas, which included the first performance of "L'ogre", their reputation began to spread which led to the first public performance of "Le dernier sorcier". With help of Franz Liszt, its first professional public performance was arranged for the Weimar Hoftheater, where it premiered on April 8, 1869 and was repeated on April 11. For those performances, the libretto was translated into German by Richard Pohl and the score was arranged for a full orchestra by Eduard Lassen. The reviews of "Der letzte Zauberer" (the opera's German title) were mixed. According to Žekulin, this may have been due to the "ponderous" German translation and the arrangement for a full symphony orchestra which overwhelmed what was originally composed as a chamber piece. Nevertheless, there were subsequent performances of the German version in Karlsruhe (January 28 and February 1, 1870) and in Riga later that year as part of a benefit performance for Louise Mayer, who had been a pupil of Viardot's in Baden-Baden.
Viardot's villa in Baden-Baden had an adjacent salon and art gallery. She later added a small theatre there known locally as the Théâtre du Thiergarten, which could seat about 30 people, making it appropriate for small stage productions. The theatre was inaugurated on August 13, 1869 with a gala performance of "Le dernier sorcier". Brahms was in the audience that night and returned to conduct the August 23 performance himself. although on that occasion, it was given in a chamber orchestration—piano, string quartet, harp and percussion. After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, the Viardot family left Baden-Baden for London where they stayed until l871, with Turgenev, once again living nearby. While Viardot was in London, "Le dernier sorcier" received a private performance there.
The work was largely forgotten until January 2005 when the University of Calgary staged its North American premiere using the French libretto and the version of the score for chamber orchestra that had been used at the 1869 gala performance in the Théâtre du Thiergarten, which Žekulin reconstructed from Viardot's papers at Harvard University. As part of the commemorations for the centenary of Viardot's death, the opera was given another staging in July 2010 (using Žekulin's 2005 version of the score) at the Couvent des Minimes in Pourrières.
Synopsis.
Setting.
In a forest in a far away land lives Krakamiche. In his youth, he was a powerful and feared sorcerer who set up a magnificent magic palace and a strong servant in the forest. But time has diminished his power so that the palace is now a hut, the servant old, and Krakamiche is able to use his wand only with much effort to summon his daily bread. He lives with his daughter, Stella.
In the same forest live elves, ruled by a Queen, all of whom are Krakamiche's enemies. In his youth Krakamiche expropriated land in the forest; the elves were unable to fight him due to his power. But in his old age, they pester and annoy him. Nearby lives Price Lelio, a king's son, who often hunts in the forest. He has fallen in love with Stella and wants to marry her, although he doesn't know who she is.
All action takes place within Krakamiche's hut.
Act 1.
The curtain rises on Krakamiche's hut, where the elves are teasing Krakamiche ("Par ici, par ici!"). They pour water on his fireplace and laugh at his distress. With the Queen, they plan to disguise themselves as Cochinese and to trick Krakamiche into taking magic grass that will lead him to believe in the restoration of his youth. They exit upon the entrance of Prince Lelio who pines for Stella ("Dans le bois frais et sombre"). The Queen appears and makes a deal with Lelio: In return for his obeying her commands, she gives him a magic flower that enables him to disappear (the flower only works at night) ("Ramasse cette rose"). They exit.
Krakamiche returns, moans his fate ("Ah la sotte existence") and has a comic duet with his servant Perlimpinpin ("Eh bien!"), resulting in the servant being kicked out of the house and Krakamiche leaving. Stella enters and sings of the rain ("Chanson de la pluie" or "Coulez, gouttes fines"). The Queen returns and tells Stella of her impending meeting with Lelio ("Sur les yeux de ton père"). Perlimpinpin enters, revealing his agedness ("Chanson de Perlimpinpin" or "Quand j'étais un géant"). A delegation of Cochinese is heard approaching (really the elves in disguise) and Krakamiche receives them ("Messieurs le sénateurs!"). After the welcome, he is eager to try the magic grass, but the trick is revealed, and he winds up being tormented by the elves and driven to a wild waltz ("Ronde des Lutins" or "Tourne, tourne comme un tonton"). The Queen and the elves celebrate victory and depart ("Ronde des elfes" or "Compagnes ailées").
Act 2.
Lelio cannot wait to use the magic flower to approach Stella ("Stornello" or "Pourrais-je jamais aimer une autre femme?"). He withdraws upon hearing the approach of Krakamiche and Stella. Krakamiche is carrying a book of spells from Merlin, and searches for the incantation that will prevent the Queen's power from affecting him. Stella works her spinning wheel. A duet ensues in which Krakamiche desires wealth and seeks revenge for his tormentors, but Stella doesn't want wealth but just a happy home and warm heart ("Si tu ne sais pas"). While Krakamiche seeks the incantation, Stella sings a song, but hears Lelio sing the third verse ("Quand vient la saison fleurie"). Lelio enters using the magic flower. He and Stella sing to one another ("C'est moi, ne craignez rien"), but Krakamiche can not see him, in part because he thinks he found the correct words. Lelio kneels before Stella, but drops the flower. This makes him visible to Krakamiche, who thinks it was his own power which has made the prince appear, and who is furious. He casts a spell to summon a monster who will annihilate the prince ("Louppola, Schibbola, Trix"). But instead of a monster, the spell brings forth a goat, and Krakamiche faints from exhaustion. As Stella and Lelio rush to help him, the Queen appears. In order to help the young couple, Krakamiche gives in and consents to his daughter's marriage and promises to leave the forest, to live with his daughter and son-in-law in the latter's castle. In an unaccompanied quartet, Krakamiche, Stella, Lelio, and Perlimpinpin sing of their futures ("Adieu témoins de ma misère!"). They leave, and the Queen waves her wand, making Krakamiche's hut disappear as the elves rejoice over the return of their forest ("Salut! Salut! O forêt bien aimée!").

Henech Kon

Henech Kon or Henryk Kon (1890–1972) was a Polish cabaret performer. 
Kon was born in Łódź to a Chassidic family, and sent at the age of 12 to his grandfather in Kutno, where he studied Torah but also studied with local klezmers, absorbing folk music from players and badkhonim. When his family realized he would never be a rabbi, they sent him to music school in Berlin.
In 1912 he returned to Poland where he was drawn into literary artistic circles of Jewish Warsaw, particularly the "artistic culture salon" of the famous Polish actress Tea Artsishevska (née Miryam Isroels), later a member of the revi-teater Azazel. Her then husband, sculptor Bernard Kratko, introduced Kon to Isaac Leib Peretz and Kon set several of Peretz's works to music, including "Treyst mayn folk (Comfort My People)" and the play "Bay nakht oyfn alten mark (A Night in the Old Marketplace)".
In 1922 "proletarian Lodz was tired of earnest dramas and light comedies." Responding to the new popularity of satire, Kon - with poet Moishe Broderzon and painter Yitschok Broyner - created the marionette theater "Chad-Gadya", the first of a string of revi-teaters (venues for music theater revues) in Polish towns and cities.
"Henekh Kon was Moyshe Broderson's closest collaborator, building with him all the kleynkunst theaters in Poland: the marionette-theater Khad-Gadye (1922) in Lodz, the kleynkunst theater "Azazel" (1925) in Warsaw, "Sambatiyon" (1926) and "Azazel" (1927). His was the musical spirit behind all of them."
He later was also closely associated with the kleynkunst (small art) venue "Ararat". He composed music for around 40 theater productions. including Sholem Asch's "Kiddush ha-Shem", Shakespeare's "Shylock," Aaron Zeitlin (Tseytlin)'s "Yidnshtot", Moshe Lipshitz' "Hershele Ostropolyer", Dovid Bergelson's "Di broytmil (The bread mill)", H. Leyvik's "Der Golem," and many others.
His opera "David and Batsheba" was written (with Moshe Broderson) and presented in Warsaw in 1924. Kon himself sang in the production, as did Moshe Shneur's chorus.
He is strongly associated with the Warsaw Yung-teater, the Yiddish avant-garde theater company which emerged from Michal Weichert's Yiddish Theater Studio. He wrote the music for "Boston", about Sacco and Vanzetti, "Trupe Tanentzap", an Abraham Goldfaden spectacle, "Napoleon's Treasure", based on a Sholem Aleichem story, and many others.
After the Second World War Kon worked with the Yiddish Art Theater in Paris. Beginning in 1934 Henech Kon also worked in film; he composed the music for "The Dibbuk" and Zygmund Turkow's "Di freylekhe kabtsonim (The Jolly Paupers)" among others. He moved to America, where he was never particularly successful, and died in New York City.

Hawaii Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement

DLNR POLICE.
Hawaii Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement(DOCARE) and also known as the Hawaii DLNR Police, is the law enforcement agency for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. It is tasked with full state police powers to enforces all State laws and Department rules,with primary jurisdiction involving State lands, State Parks, historical sites, forest reserves, aquatic life and wildlife areas, coastal zones, Conservation districts, State shores, as well as county ordinances involving county parks, for enforcing Hawaii’s fishing and recreational boating laws and protecting reefs and other marine resources, patrolling harbors and coastal areas, and conducting marijuana eradication missions.
Officers patrol of state ocean waters, of state land or conservation land, and of coast line. Statewide, there are approximately 120 conservation officers divided among six islands. 
New programs & issues.
DOCARE established Fisheries Enforcement Units in 2011, on Maui, Big Island and Kaua‘i, that consist of one supervisory captain, two field officers to increase enforcement of Hawai‘i’s nearshore fisheries to increase sustainability. This will be financed by a joint-initiative between the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, Conservation International and the Harold K.L. Castle Foundation.
The Illegal hunting, fishing, and Koa theft top state enforcement concerns in 2010 on the Island of Kauai.
In 2010 DLNR Police had about 100 officers used to patrol from the mountains tops to 3 miles off shore. They also have 20 boats and 2 jet skis which are used statewide. The breakdown of Officers by island is: Oahu-42, Big Island-22, Maui County-22 and Kauai 14.
Controversy regarding shortage of enforcement officers to protect Hawaiian resources.
In May 2011, William Aila, Director of the Department of Land and Natural Resources said, “eventually the department will need four times as many conservation officers as it does now to properly serve all the enforcement expectations of the department, which has jurisdiction over all state lands and the near-shore waters”. 
The Nature Conservancy of Hawai'i is among a long list of groups that have advocated for more DOCARE officers. Others are the Sierra Club, the Conservation Council for Hawai'i, KAHEA: The Hawaiian-Environmental Alliance, the Hawaii Audubon Society, the Pacific Fisheries Coalition and Malama Hawai'i. "It doesn't matter if it's from the conservation community, the fishing community or the recreational user community, there are not a lot of things we agree on, but there is one thing we agree on: We'd all like to see more capacity and a greater level of enforcement," said Mark Fox, director of external affairs for The Nature Conservancy.
Maui fisherman Darrell Tanaka said, “many people engaged in illegal activities that contribute to overfishing don't worry about getting caught. Tanaka is part of a growing group of fishers who have become advocates for DOCARE and laws promoting sustainable fisheries”.
New Holiday enforcement operations on Kaneohe sandbar.
On 4-wheels, by boat and on foot - DLNR police officers were on patrol - enforcing new rules at the Kaneohe sandbar, including a ban on alcohol. In response to overcrowding and incidents involving drugs and alcohol at the sandbar, the state stepped in to keep the crowds calm.
"We recognize this behavior can no longer be allowed to occur," said State Conservation Officer Randy Awo.
State sheriffs, narcotics agents and Attorney General investigators were also working double duty.
“We'll do whatever we need to do to ensure compliance is being attained," said Awo. “We are taking this initiative very seriously."
Marijuana eradication.
DLNR Police became actively involved in eradication for a number of reasons:
Safety and welfare of forest users like hunters, hikers, DLNR employees, researchers and flower gatherers is a priority for our Department. Hostile encounters and booby traps along with a variety of other criminal acts have been associated with the illegal cultivation of marijuana on State land.
Cultivation has the potential of destroying native habitat due to the introduction of herbicides, clear cutting, fertilizers, pesticides, rodenticide, alien species, and trash. This in turn has a direct negative impact on our fragile natural resources and disrupts sensitive wildlife species. 
Large tracks of State land are being used for marijuana cultivation. Since much of this land is under the jurisdiction of DLNR, we have the primary responsibility to eradicate these plants.
It has been estimated that approximately 75% of all marijuana eradicated in Hawaii was found on DLNR land. More plants could and would be eradicated if adequate funding were available.

Papyrus Rylands 458

Papyrus Rylands 458 is a copy of the Pentateuch in a Greek version of the Hebrew Bible known as the Septuagint. It is a papyrus manuscript in roll form. The manuscript has been assigned palaeographically to the 2nd century BC and it is the oldest known manuscript of the Greek Bible. The manuscript has survived in very fragmentary condition.
Description.
The text was written on papyrus in uncial letters. It is designated by the number 957 on the list of Septuagint manuscripts according to the numbering system devised by Alfred Rahlfs. The surviving texts of the Book of Deuteronomy are verses Deut 23:24(26)–24:3; 25:1–3; 26:12; 26:17–19; 28:31–33; 27:15; 28:2.
The manuscript consists of only 8 small fragments, designated by the letters "a"–"h". Fragment "h" is the smallest and contains only two letters. The words are not divided by spaces, but written continuously. The writer uses the colometrical system, regularly leaving a space at the end of sentence or clause.
The text of the manuscript agrees more with the "Codex Cottonianus" than with the Codex Vaticanus.
The manuscript has been used in discussions about the Tetragrammaton, although there are actually blank spaces in the places where some scholars such as C. H. Roberts believe that it contained letters. According to Paul E. Kahle, the Tetragrammaton must have been written in the manuscript where these breaks or blank spaces appear.
History of the codex.
Palaeographically the manuscript has been assigned to the mid-2nd century BC. It is the oldest known manuscript of the Septuagint. It is believed it came from Fayyum, where there were two Jewish synagogues.
The manuscript was discovered in 1917 by J. Rendel Harris. It was examined by A. Vacari (1936) and A. Pietersma (1985). The text was edited by C. H. Roberts in 1936.
The manuscript is currently housed at the John Rylands Library (Gr. P. 458) in Manchester, giving the manuscript its name.

The Whirling Dervish

The Whirling Dervish is an album by American jazz pianist Mal Waldron featuring performances recorded in Paris in 1972 and released by the French America label. 
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Jason Ankeny awarded the album 4 stars stating ""The Whirling Dervish" looms among Mal Waldron's boldest and most challenging sessions -- its three epic compositions are intimidating in their scope and reach, but the music rewards the intellectual commitment it demands with some of the pianist's most inspired playing".

Changpa

The Changpa (or sometimes pronounced as Champa) are a semi-nomadic Tibetan ethnic group found mainly in Zanskar region of Jammu and Kashmir. A smaller number were also in the western regions of the TAR until they suffered forced relocation, carried out by the Chinese government.
Changpa of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The homeland of the Changpa is a high altitude plateau known as the Changtang, which forms a portion of western and northern Tibet extending into southeastern Ladakh, and "Changpa" means 'northerners' in Tibetan. Unlike many other nomadic groups in Tibet, the Changpa are not under pressure from settled farmers as the vast majority of land they inhabit is too inhospitable for farming.
Most of the Tibetan Changtang is now protected nature reserves consisting of the Changtang Nature Reserve, the second-largest nature reserve in the world, and four new adjoining smaller reserves totalling 496,000 km2. (191,507 sq. miles) of connected Nature Reserves, which represents an area almost as large as Spain, and bigger than 197 countries. Since the reserves have been established there has been a welcome increase in the numbers of endangered species. The protected areas stretch across parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. and Qinghai Province in China
Changpa of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Changpa of Ladakh are high altitude pastoralists, raising mainly yaks and goats. Among the Lasakh Changpa, those who are still nomadic are known as Phalpa, and they take their herds from in the Hanley Valley to the village of Lato. Hanley is home to six isolated settlements, where the sedentary Changpa, the Fangpa reside. Despite their different lifestyles, both these groups intermarry. The Changpa speak Changskhat, which is a dialect of Tibetan, and practice Tibetan Buddhism.
Only a small part of Changtang crosses the border into Ladakh, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is, however, on a historically important route for travellers journeying from Ladakh to Lhasa, and now has many different characteristics due to being part of India. Historically, the Changpa of the Lasakh would migrate with their herds into Tibet, but with Chinese occupation of Tibet, this route has been closed.
, the Changpa were classified as a Scheduled Tribe under the Indian government's reservation program of positive discrimination.

Big Chocolate (musician)

Cameron Argon, better known by his stage name Big Chocolate (born August 21, 1990 in Laguna Hills, CA) is an American musician, producer and vlogger. He is the former vocalist for the death metal band Burning the Masses and is the founder of the death metal solo project Disfiguring the Goddess and has gained renowned work in the music industry by his skill in music production and remixing. Argon specializes in electronic dance music styles ranging from dubstep, drum and bass and electronica. He has released five EPs and two full-length dubstep albums to date and has done remixes for Suicide Silence, Asking Alexandria, Iwrestledabearonce and many other bands. Under his death metal project Disfiguring the Goddess, Argon has released two full-length albums, two EPs and two demos, with a third full-length completed and set for release in December 2013.
Argon has performed his electronic music in various clubs along the West Coast and has toured the United States with Dance Gavin Dance, Iwrestledabearonce and In Fear and Faith during the spring of 2011, as well as the entire Warped Tour during the same year.
History.
Prior to working under the name Big Chocolate full-time, Argon was spending most of his time concentrating on metal. Argon handled lead vocals on Burning the Masses's album, "Offspring of Time" and toured in Europe with them on the "Legacy of Blood" tour alongside Suffocation. Shortly after that, a representative at Century Media Records reached out to Argon for a request to remix the song, "Disengage" by Suicide Silence. Argon accepted the offer and found that he loved the freedom and creativeness remixing allowed and began focusing his efforts on the entire EDM scene.
Shortly after the Suicide Silence remix, he released his first and second EPs, First Degree Revolution and Shacka Brah. At the time, Argon was still in college and was creating music for the fun of it. It wasn't until the late summer of 2010 that he decided not to enroll for the upcoming Fall semester and concentrate on music full-time. He continued to receive opportunities for remixes, released the "I'm Shot" EP and then was confirmed for Dance Gavin Dance's reunion tour in the Spring of 2011. He released his third EP, "HiLion" on March 1, 2011, that featured the title track single with guest appearances by the rapper, Grieves. On March 2, 2011 it was announced that Big Chocolate would be performing all summer long on that year's Warped Tour.
Since then he has released another full length album "Red Headed Locc" and 2 more EPs, "The Red EP" and "Clean".
Other projects.
Disfiguring the Goddess (2006-present).
Argon has been the sole member of the deathcore project Disfiguring the Goddess for several years; he had produced 2 demos, an EP and a full length album before he began venturing into electronic music and still continues to release material under this name, despite not having as much time as he used to work on his metal releases.
In April 2012, Argon released an EP under his death metal solo project Disfiguring the Goddess titled "Sleeper". The EP was released with a limited run of 1,000 hardcopies that include a bonus CD, containing extra content.
Throughout the latter part of 2012 and 2013, Argon worked on a new Disfiguring the Goddess album; it was later revealed to be called "Deprive". On 25 October 2013, he released a new track "The Pathway To Everlasting Nothingness", which he released via the website MetalSucks, as well as announcing that a new track would be revealed every week leading up to the release of the album. The second track "Death's Head Mask" was premiered via Metal Injection on 30 October; pre-order packages were also announced on the same day. "Deprive" will be released on 10 December 2013.
Commissioner (2010-2012).
After mixing his first track for Suicide Silence, Argon struck up a friendship with the band. He and Mitch Lucker, Suicide Silence's vocalist at the time, formed Commissioner, an extreme industrial metal duo. Commissioner had released two tracks before releasing their EP, one featuring Whitechapel frontman Phil Bozeman, entitled "Click Click Flash" and the other being "Consume" which marked the debut release by the group. The duo released their first EP titled "What Is?" on March 21, 2011.
Commissioner is now permanently inactive due to Mitch Lucker's death on 1 November 2012.

Cyanea shipmanii

Cyanea shipmanii is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name Shipman's cyanea. It is endemic to the island of Hawaii, where it is known only from the windward slopes of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
New populations of this species, usually consisting of only a handful of individuals each, are still rarely found in the wild at widely scattered locations in windward native forests, at around 5000-6000 feet elevation. There has been widespread outplanting of hundreds of nursery-raised cyanea shipmanii in recent years, but the genetic diversity of these outplantings is very low due to the small number of original wild plants they are descended from. It is not clear whether any of these recent outplantings will lead to self-sustaining wild populations. Only 37% of cyanea shipmanii seedlings have survived when planted in habitat.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a fragile sparingly branched shrub which can reach four meters in height. The leaves are deeply divided and subdivided with many tiny lobes, resembling the fronds of ferns. The leaves and stems of young plants and the lower parts of larger plants are encrusted with weak thorn-like bristles, as with many other cyanea species. The inflorescence bears many greenish white flowers, producing clusters of small orange fruits each bearing many small seeds. The natural habitat of the plant is moist native forests on well-developed volcanic soils. The plant has been driven toward extinction by degradation of its habitat by logging, cattle ranching, exotic plant species and feral pigs.
