Air Beef Scheme

After World War II, pastoralists from the Western Australian Kimberley region sought to develop the local beef export industry by encouraging infrastructure development there. Three brothers, Gordon, Douglas and Keith Blythe who owned and operated several pastoral leases in the east Kimberley devised an Air Beef Scheme (also known as the Glenroy Air Beef Scheme) by which a meatworks including an abattoir, carcase freezing facilities and an aerodrome were built at the remote Glenroy Station on the Mount House lease, about east of Imintji Aboriginal Community near Derby. The scheme operated successfully from 1949 to 1965 and was important for the economic development of the towns of Wyndham and Derby as well as the development of the Kimberley pastoral industry generally.
Beef cattle were brought in from a radius around the east Kimberley to be slaughtered, quartered, boned and chilled overnight, and the following day air shipments were made to Wyndham, a , 75-minute flight away using Bristol Freighter and Douglas DC-3 aircraft. The beef was frozen at Wyndham and then shipped to the United Kingdom.
Gordon Blythe had convinced MacRobertson Miller Airlines (MMA) to do a trial air shipment in May 1947 when four carcasses were slaughtered and left at the station at 2am, arriving in Perth in good condition at 3pm the same day. The trial being considered a success, a company Air Beef Ltd. was established as a joint venture between the Blythes, MMA and Australian National Airways (ANA), with each party putting up one quarter of the capital and the Western Australian Government (through the North West Development and Advisory Committee, which was headed by Russell Dumas), assisting and providing a loan for the remaining quarter. It was hoped that the scheme would spawn a network of inland abattoirs throughout northern Australia, however this did not eventuate; plans for a similar facility at Fitzroy Crossing were shelved.
The plant had a capacity of 300 head of cattle per week and in an average season (May to September) would process about 4,000 head per year.
In 1949 the Commonwealth Government passed the "State Grants (Encouragement of Beef Production) Act 1949" which allowed funding for the construction of roads and other infrastructure to support the beef industry, as it was accepted by that time that airfreighting was going to be uneconomic in the long term. By 1953 the southern section of the Gibb River Road to Derby was completed and the first live shipment of cattle by truck from the east Kimberley was made. The Derby Meat Company (DEMCO, "Derby Meats") was established by the Blythes and others in 1959 and from then the airshipments were made to the closer destination of Derby. The construction of the road and the completion of slaughtering facilities at DEMCO in 1965 spelt the demise of the scheme and the abattoir was closed in the same year.

Blackwell railway station

Blackwell railway station was a railway station serving Blackwell in the English county of Worcestershire. It was opened by the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway in 1841 a year after the line opened. In 1846 it became part of the Midland Railway which had been formed two years before. 
It was situated at the top of the steepest part of the Lickey Incline and, slightly to the north was the sidings where the banking engines would drop back from their trains and reverse ready to return to Bromsgrove. In addition trains travelling southwards or down would be brought to a stand at the head of the incline for a brake test including, until 1941, passenger trains. In the days before through braking of goods trains, wagon brakes would have to be pinned down. Even later, when vacuum braking had been introduced, most trains would only be partly fitted and, often, a banking engine would have to lead the train to provide extra braking
There were two platforms, that on the down (southward) line being exceedingly long - much longer than that on the up side. Access to it was by a barrow crossing to the south, there being no footbridge. There were short goods sidings for each line running into bay platforms with an extra one on the up side. The entrance and booking hall was on the up platform, with a small waiting room on the other side. Construction was of typical Midland Railway brick built design with wooden awnings
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The station closed in 1966. Although a few railway cottages still exist, the station itself has disappeared.

David Claerbout

David Claerbout (born 1969, Kortrijk, Belgium) is a Belgian artist working in the media of photography, video, sound, drawing and digital arts, though perhaps he is best known for his large scale video installations. His work exists at the meeting point between photography and film, and is at the forefront of this contemporary dialogue.
Early life and education.
Claerbout studied at Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp from 1992-1995. He trained as a painter, but became more and more interested in time through investigations in the nature of photography, the still and the moving image (Bergson's duree echoed in Gilles Deleuze "Cinema 1" and "Cinema 2").
Work.
In early works such as "Kindergarten Antonio Sant’Elia 1932" made in 1998 and the last in a series, he presents an old, black and white photograph as a large, mute projection. 
In "Vietnam, 1967, near Duc Pho (Reconstruction after Hiromishi Mine)" (2001) time is suspended as an airplane caught by the camera moments before its crash, floats, the sunlight gently moving over a green and hilly landscape. In the book "Visible Time", David Green writes: 
“What one actually experiences or indeed what one sees in this work, is not the conflation of photography and film but, a conjuncture of the two mediums in which neither ever loses its specificity. We are thus faced with a phenomenon in which two different mediums co-exist and seem to simultaneously occupy the same object. The projection screen here provides a point of intersection for both the photographic and filmic image.”
With works such as "Villa Corthout" (2001) and "Piano Player" (2002), Claerbout’s work moves towards forms of narratives to describe ‘moments in time’ within the moving image, taking a more cinematic dimension.
In the "Bordeaux Piece" (2004) actors repeat a given dialogue and a set of given movements, deconstructing cinematic time. It centers on a conversation between a couple that is repeated over and over in different parts of a 1996 Bordeaux house designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas. The piece is in fact a 14 hours film made out of 70 shorter films shot at 10 minutes intervals throughout the day. The narrative slowly collapses, giving way to the movement of the sun over the landscape, architecture and people, thus creating a different temporality. One protagonist is played by Josse De Pauw, who helped Claerbout write the script. 
In "Sections of a Happy Moment" (2007), Claerbout seems to ‘dissect’ a moment in the life of a Chinese family in the courtyard of a nondescript estate. A group of people are gathered around a ball suspended mid-air, all the faces turned towards it, smiling happily. Over the course of 25 minutes, this moment in time is analyzed from a multitude of different angles and perspectives, allowing the viewer an omnipresence that is paradoxical. The fragmentation of time in this piece, through freeze – frames of the same moment, creates 'visible duration'.
In "Sunrise" (2009), Claerbout presents an 18-minute work in near-darkness, accentuating the dim tones by projecting the film on to a grey surface. For nearly the entire film a housemaid goes about her chores in the muted light of pre-dawn, finally departing the house and cycling through a dimly-lit landscape, accompanied by Sergei Rachmaninoff's "Vocalise" (1912).
Set on the coastline of Brittany, France, "The Quiet Shore" (2011) is a 36-minute black-and-white film capturing scenes that range from moments of minute detail to panoramic expanses of coastal landscape. The viewer experiences, frame by frame, a single moment from a multitude of different perspectives and viewpoints.
Exhibitions.
David Claerbout took part in the DAAD Berlin Artist Program in 2002-2003 and has exhibited in numerous group and solo exhibitions, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, where he held a comprehensive solo exhibition (2007–2008) which toured to List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge MA (2008), Kunstmuseum, St Gallen (2008), Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver (2008), and De Pont, Museum of Contemporary Art, Tilburg (2009). Other solo exhibitions include ‘Diese Sonne strahlt immer’, Vienna Secession (2012); ‘David Claerbout: Architecture of Narrative’, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2011); ‘The Time That Remains’, WIELS Contemporary Art Centre, Brussels (2011); and ‘uncertain eye’, Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich (2010). 
Claerbout is represented by Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, Antwerp, Yvon Lambert Gallery, Paris and Johnen Galerie, Cologne.

Samuel António da Silva Tavares Quina (born 3 August 1966), simply known as Samuel, is a Guinean-born Portuguese retired professional footballer.
Having played mostly for Benfica in the late 1980s and early 90's, he operated mainly as a central defender.
Club career.
A product of Sport Lisboa e Benfica's youth ranks, Samuel made his debut with the first team on 30 December 1983 (aged 17), after being brought on as a substitute by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson in a 4–0 home win over G.D. Chaves for the Portuguese Cup. His first goal for the club came in a 2–2 away draw against Sporting de Braga, and he went on to have a somewhat an important role in the Lisbon side during seven seasons.
Quina started in the 1990 European Cup final, a 0–1 loss against A.C. Milan, pitching in at left back on the occasion. His last game for Benfica was in a 1–0 victory at Louletano D.C. on 29 November 1992, and he went on to represent Boavista FC – he returned one season to Benfica, but was released at its closure – Vitória de Guimarães, F.C. Tirsense, Odivelas FC and S.L. Fanhões.
After years away from the game, Samuel opened a football academy in his hometown, where he worked with youngsters.

Since its founding, the review has been dedicated to "the publication of not only theoretical articles of the law, but articles of real practical aid to the practitioner." It has placed particular emphasis on legal issues in Wisconsin, which led former Wisconsin Chief Justice George R. Currie to "express on behalf of the members of our court appreciation to a Law Review from which we have so greatly benefited in performing our judicial labors."
Staff.
The "Marquette Law Review" is produced by a staff of 50 student editors and members. Membership invitations are extended to students in the top ten percent of the 1L class.

Union Riga

Union Riga was a football club established in Riga in 1907. It was the winner of the Riga football league in 1910. In the period of independence of Latvia between the World wars Union played in the Latvian Higher League for several years. Being essentially a sports club of Baltic Germans, Union was disestablished in 1939 with the repatriation of Baltic Germans.
History.
The Riga cycling club Union was founded in 1893. A football section of the club was opened in 1907 - shortly after British FC Riga, thus Union was the second football club to be formed on the territory of Latvia. In the first years of its existence there was a tense rivalry between Union and BFC - the former being a mostly German side and the latter - a club for which played entirely Britons. In 1910 Union was one of the three sides to play in the newly founded Riga football league - alongside BFC and Ķeizarmežs (a second German side). BFC won the tournament however the British team was later disqualified and Union declared the winner. Union won the first Riga Football Cup that was also played in 1910. Union won the second Riga league title in 1912, it was also twice second in the league - in 1911 and 1915. The most significant prewar-footballers in the Union team were Harold Trevenen Hall and Herberts Baumanis, the former was called "the father of Latvian football", while the latter was later one of the leading football officials in Latvia. Another footballer worth mentioning to play for Union in its early years was Česlavs Stančiks.
Because of World War I and the struggle for independence football ceased to be played regularly in Latvia until 1919-1920. Union was among the sports clubs to be restored in the independent Latvia and it participated in the first restored Riga championship in 1921, however due to an early winter the season was not finished. In the next years competition Union finished fourth in the top tier of the Riga championship (out of 5 teams). Several top players left Union for ASK Riga after the season and the following year Union finished last in the league and was relegated to a lower level.
Union played in the second Riga league division until 1927 when Virsliga was established - a league to hold football clubs from both Riga and other cities of Latvia. Thus the top teams from Class A of Riga league were promoted to Virsliga and Union was among the teams to play in the new Class A. In 1929 Union finished second in Class A (with the same amount of points as Riga Wanderer). It gave the club the right to play in play-offs for a spot in the expanded Virsliga. Union won its play-off matches and was to compete in Virsliga for the first time in 1930.
In its first year in the top league Union finished fourth (it was in the second place in the league after the first half of the season) and improved by one position the next year - winning its one and only Latvian league medals. The following years the clubs fortune started to decline and in 1935 it faced relegation from Virsliga after an especially disappointing season. Union played in the Riga first league until 1939 when the club was disbanded when Baltic Germans repatriated to Germany.
Notable players.
There were several players from Union who played for Latvia national football team however out of those several stand out - Jānis Bebris was one of the all-time best Latvian goalkeepers who later played in the French Division 1 after World War II. Bebris played for Union for three years - from 1933 to 1935. Another significant footballer to play for Union was Vladimirs Bērziņš - one of the most capped pre-war Latvian footballers (he played with Union for 2 years - from 1925 to 1926). However the symbol of Union's football club was Ēriks Skadiņš who represented it through all the hardships of the clubs life, giving more than 15 years of his life to the side, representing it from 1922 to 1939.

BrightHouse (retailer)

BrightHouse is the largest rent-to-own company in the United Kingdom, with over 270 stores. BrightHouse is a trading name of Caversham Finance Limited which is owned by private equity firm Vision Capital.
History.
Caversham Finance Limited, previously a subsidiary of Thorn Group plc, was taken private in September 1998 in a deal arranged and financed by the Principal Finance Group of Nomura (now reconstructed as Terra Firma Capital Partners). The company was bought by Vision Capital in July 2007.
BrightHouse is a national retail chain that sells home electronic and domestic appliances, and household furniture and related products, on a ‘rent to own’ basis. It employs more than 3,000 staff nationwide, and expansion is planned to continue, with a further 35 stores set to open during the next 12 months.
June 2009 saw the launch of its online hiring site.
BrightHouse released its financial results in July 2010 showing a 15.7 per cent rise in annual sales to £197.3 million. Over the Christmas period 2010 BrightHouse saw their sales increase 13.7 percent to 57.4 million pounds in the 13 weeks to 31 December.
Revenue increased 17.1% to £266.5m for the year to 31 March 2012.
Product offerings.
BrightHouse currently stocks brands which include Samsung, Sony, Philips, Acer, LG, Nintendo, Baird, Whirlpool, Beko, BlackBerry and Nokia.
Some sources suggest Brighthouse makes it impossible to compare prices, though Chief executive Leo McKee said the retailer benefits through a "really obsessive" approach to customer service, with "aspirational products at very competitive prices", claiming that though an active comparison is not obvious, it actively compares with other retail competitors; The Co-operative, Amazon.com, Yhor and 24Ace.
Furniture accounts for about 20 per cent of sales, audio and visual for 30 per cent, domestic appliances for 20 per cent and technology for 30 per cent.
Awards.
BrightHouse won Large Business of the Year at the Business Excellence Awards 2012
BrightHouse won Best High Street Recycler at the National Recycling Awards 2012
In 2008, BrightHouse won Best High Street Recycler at the National Recycling Awards. Moreover, the company won a Green Apple Award for Environmental Best Practice.
BrightHouse has been shortlisted for the Retail Technology Initiative of the Year in the "Oracle Retail Week Awards 2010". Results are to be announced on 4 March.
Charity and Partnerships.
In October 2007, BrightHouse announced an exclusive agreement with Five to sponsor the "Trisha Goddard" show.
BrightHouse partnered the NSPCC in 2009. As well as running various fundraising events for the charity, BrightHouse has posters and promotional material in their stores to raise awareness.
In 2010, Brighthouse partnered with Centerprise International Limited, an approved Becta supplier to participate in the Home Access programme. This is a Government-backed initiative through which some 270,000 eligible low income families in England will be offered grants for a home computer and internet access. People who are registered will be able to order their free computer from one of Brighthouse's 192 stores.
Criticism.
In May 2009, an investigation by BBC Newsbeat suggested that BrightHouse mistreated customers who missed payments. A former employee, Tristam Meyrick, told Newsbeat that the company tried to repossess goods without obtaining a court order, saying "We would just lie our way around it. Tell them we had the legal right to be there, and refuse to leave until they gave us the stuff." Commercial director Hamish Paton denied the company mistreated its customers, saying "We would only ever take the goods with the consent of the customer". Chris Tapp, director of charity Credit Action called for the Office of Fair Trading to investigate.
The company's lending practices have been criticised for targeting the "poorest, most desperate families" and operating in the "most deprived areas" of the UK. Other customers end up paying more than twice what they would have paid absent BrightHouse's finance charges. Their base prices have also been noted to be higher than those of upscale mainstream retailers such as Harrods.

Selenter See

The Selenter See is the second-largest lake in the North German state of Schleswig-Holstein, after the Großer Plöner See. It lies at an elevation of and has an area of 22.4 km².
The "Selenter See", which lies near the village of Selent in the district of Plön, is 34 m deep. The lake drains into the Baltic Sea through the Hohenfelder Mühlenau, only 10 km long, to the north and by the Salzau to the northwest. 
The formation of the "Selenter See" goes back to the ice sheets of the Weichselian glaciation, which hollowed out a basin and simultaneously formed ridges of terminal moraine up to 132 m high in the east and 90 m high in the south. From a geological point of view the lake is a so-called "tongue basin lake" or "Zungenbeckensee". 
The lake is well-known "inter alia" for plentiful supply of fish such as eel, perch, pike, and large and small whitefish and large quantities of roach.
Bird reserve.
There is a bird reserve called the "Selenter See-Gebiet" which covers the lake and its bordering reed beds and carr areas as well as the "Gottesgabe Wood". It is an important breeding, moulting and resting area for numerous birds including the Kingfisher, Bittern, Whooper Swan, Goosander, Great Crested Grebe, Crane and Sea Eagle. The reserve is managed by a charitable organisation, the LLUR.

Griebnitzsee

Griebnitzsee is a lake in the western outskirts of Berlin, the capital city of Germany. At an elevation of 29.4 m, its surface area is ca. 0.592 km². The lake forms the border between the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg. It is bordered in the north by the Wannsee district of Berlin, and in the south and west by the Babelsberg district of Potsdam in Brandenburg.
Overview.
At its eastern end, near Kohlhasenbrück in Berlin, the Griebnitzsee receives water from the Teltow Canal. One third of this water flows into the adjacent Griebnitz Canal and through a chain of lakes towards the Großer Wannsee. The remaining water flows through the Griebnitzsee to its western end, where it flows into the River Havel near Potsdam.
The length of the Griebnitzsee is navigable, and forms part of the Teltow Canal route that links the River Havel with the River Spree and the Oder-Spree Canal, bypassing the reach of the River Spree through central Berlin. The navigable Griebnitz Canal provides an alternative link from the Griebnitzsee to the River Havel via the Großer Wannsee.
During the time of the Berlin Wall, the border between Berlin and East Germany ran down the middle of the lake. A patrol path existed for border guards along the southern shore. After German reunification, this path became a public lake-side promenade.

Palčje

Palčje is a village east of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia.
Geography.
North of the village lies an intermittent lake named Lake Palčje. It is the largest among the Pivka lakes, with an average maximum water area around 1 km².
Name.
Palčje was attested in written sources in 1498 as "Palitschach". The medieval transcription indicates that today's name (a neuter singular) is derived from the accusative plural demonym "*Paličane", derived from the common noun "*palič", likely meaning 'small lake' (cognate with Lake Palić, Serbia), a diminutive of the Slavic noun "palъ", preserved in the Slovene common noun "pal" 'mud' (and cognate with German "Pfuhl" 'puddle', English "pool"). The name thus refers to Lake Palčje north of the settlement.
Church.
The local church, built on the central village square, is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Parish of Trnje.

Ralph E. Quattrociocchi

Raffaele "Ralph" E. Quattrociocchi (June 11, 1929 – February 24, 1996) was a 20th-century politician most notable for having served as New York State Senator. He was a Democrat for most of his political career.
Quattrociocchi was born in Rochester, New York and attended Edison Technical and Industrial High School. After graduation, he served the United States Air Force where he became Airman First Class in a radar unit. He then began a 30-year career as a communications technician at AT&T, where he joined the Communications Workers of America.
His first foray into politics was an unsuccessful run for the Monroe County, New York legislature in 1973. He prevailed in the election two years later for the same seat, representing part of Greece, New York, and held that office for a total of five consecutive terms.
In 1984, he unseated incumbent William M. Steinfeldt for the 55th district Senate seat.
Quattrociocchi's accomplishments include securing state funding to extend New York State Route 531 to Ogden, New York, forming a senate task force on teen stress, and instituting "Operation Watch" to reduce the likelihood of mishaps at railroad crossing signals.
In 1988, Quattrociocchi was swept up in Robert M. Morgenthau's investigation of Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein and the alleged misuse of state monies to fund the 1986 campaigns of several state Senators. The presiding judge found that Quattrociocchi was aware that a full-time aide had been hired for the sole purpose of campaigning, but since the deed had taken place outside of New York County, the District Attorney had no jurisdiction. District Attorneys in Albany and Monroe counties subsequently declined to prosecute.
In the early 1990s, the 55th senate district was redrawn to include Brighton, Monroe County, New York and parts of the city of Rochester, ultimately leading to his defeat in both the 1992 Democratic primary and the general election. Quattrociocchi switched political parties the year before the 1994 election, only to be defeated again.
He died of a heart attack in 1996 and is interred in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

<doc id="21562786" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21562786" title="Darkfall">
Darkfall

Darkfall is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Aventurine SA that combines real-time action and strategy in a fantasy setting. The game features unrestricted PvP, full looting, a large, dynamic game world, and a player-skill dependent combat system free of the class and level systems that typify most MMORPGs. Darkfall has a 3D world environment and contains mild violence.
Gameplay.
Skills.
"Darkfall" departs from the conventional MMORPG paradigm of character levels as the main form of character progression, favouring instead a broad skill-based system, similar to that found in games such as "Ultima Online", "Eve Online", "Wurm Online" and "Asheron's Call". Skills and skill proficiency determine a wide range of a character's capability in the game, including weapons and weapon skills, a few special attacks, spells, and archery, all aspects of player crafting, as well as more basic facets of gameplay, such as the ability to swim, craft various items types, and to ride and control mounts.
Skills may be learned from NPC trainers in the game, however certain skills will require other skills as prerequisites. Without exception however, skills are improved (raised in power) through actual usage in game.
Playable races.
There are six playable races in "Darkfall", divided into 3 factions. Unlike other MMORPGs, racial choice does not heavily influence character choices or progression options. Each race begins play in their own homeland, and have their own unique storylines, histories, and racial alliances/enemies. It is possible to form mixed-race clans of opposing factions, however racial alignment adjustments (see 'Alignment') are always in effect.
While certain races have friendships and hatreds with other races in "Darkfall", these are not strictly enforced upon the players, and it is possible for allied clans to declare war upon both their own race and their racial allies. Declaring war against a clan will prevent players of the declaring clan from sustaining alignment penalties (as well as gains) associated with attacking and killing players of the opposing clan, regardless of race.
The races, organised by faction, are:
Attributes.
As with other MMORPGs, player characters have a set of semi-static attributes, which determine their in-game physical and mental prowess. These attributes are: strength, vitality, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence, and quickness These attributes improve over time in response to player activity. For example, repeated use of a melee weapon will result in a gradual improvement in that player's strength statistic, which in turn will allow him to deal greater melee damage. There are also three dynamic attributes: hit points, mana, and stamina, which determine a player's overall vitality and capacity for physical activity and/or magic, which fluctuate in response to performing actions and receiving damage.
Likewise, the casting of magical spells requires and expends mana points, and the execution of various physical activities, such as sprinting, the swinging of weapons, and casting of spells expend stamina. All three of these statistics are regained over time at varying rates, and may be rapidly regained through the use of healing and other restorative spells, potions and items.
PvP.
"Darkfall" has been designed from the outset as a full-loot PVP game, meaning on death players are able to fully loot other players of their gear and gold on their person. The ability to fully loot other players has been factored into the game as an important facet of the risk versus reward nature of the game.
Darkfall is different from most other MMO games as it uses a mouse controlled camera paired with WASD movement similar to shooters like Doom, Quake, and Counterstrike, to fire spells, bows, and control melee attacks.
The ability to fully loot other players is a significant departure from other, contemporary MMORPGs, such as "World of Warcraft" and "EverQuest II", in which the quest for better gear is the primary driving force of player character improvement once maximum level has been attained. In "Darkfall", character skills are the primary driver of character improvement, and gear also plays a large role in determining a player character's overall power.
Friendly fire and collision detection are always in effect in "Darkfall". Combined with a real-time combat system, Darkfall's combat is anticipated to provide a more realistic combat experience than other fantasy MMORPGs. The developers have opined that historically successful battle formations and tactics will be widely adopted and adapted for use in "Darkfall".
City building and conquest.
The goal of "Darkfall" is its support for large-scale territorial conflict between player clans. To this end, empire building through the conquering of pre-made cities is a major part of the game. To promote such conflict, there is a finite number of pre-made cities (97 locations - 44 cities, 53 Hamlets) within the world. The potential pre-made city and hamlet sites are marked in-game by structures known as clanstones.
These pre-made city sites are spread across the entirety of the world, and vary greatly in location, surrounding terrain, access to nearby resource nodes, and consequently, their ability to be defended by the owning clan.
Player clans have full diplomatic control over their relationship with other player clans, and can declare war on other clans unilaterally. Clans that are at war with each other may kill each other freely without alignment penalties. Player-owned cities can be freely attacked and then sieged. Sieges last for 4 hours. In the first two hours the defenders may launch an attack on the enemy's shard holder or city. If the defenders are victorious, the siege ends. The attackers may attempt to capture the defender's city after two hours have passed. They only have two hours to destroy the clanstone. To this end, "Darkfall" contains a variety of different siege weapons such as cannons and siege hammers, all of which are player-crafted. There is a limit on the rate of destruction of a captured city of 1 building per day, however any number of buildings may be disabled at any time by bringing their structural integrity to zero.
Player housing was later added. Houses were stationed across the world and the owners could built various things inside their home or as an add-on to it once they locate a rare item called a "house deed" and find an empty spot for their home. Players would then pay taxes on their home or else they could lose it to another player who is willing to pay the tax. Clans are able to fight over these villages for control of the tax revenue which adds additional PvP elements.
In the patch "Conquer the Seas", Darkfall received two large fortresses at the North and South ends of Agon. These fortresses are only attack-able from a player built ship. If a clan controls the sea tower they get a server wide broadcast of their accomplishment, free recruitment postings in NPC towns, and additional revenue. Tons of fixes to the conquest system were also introduced in 2009 and bugged city structures were fixed.
Alignment.
"Darkfall" features a player character alignment system that ranges from good to evil based upon the actions of players. Characters start the game with a good alignment, which decreases on performing "evil" actions such as attacking racial allies without provocation, or killing racial allies. The consequences of evil actions include being temporarily attackable by guard towers in NPC controlled cities, and other players being able to attack these "grey" players without repercussion. A succession of evil actions results in negative alignment, and a permanent "kill on sight" ("red") status. Alignment can be regained only by killing racial enemies and/or by killing other evil players.
Stealth.
In "Darkfall", stealth is accomplished by playing stealthily, employing real-world stealth techniques such as moving in darkness/shadow, employing camouflage, walking silently, and using world objects as cover; that is, stealth is not automatic, and not restricted to any particular class or subset of players. Since "Darkfall" is a class-less MMORPG, any player is able to practise stealth-enhancing skills such as "crouch-walking" and to follow a stealthy play style.
This feature of stealth also comes with semi-realistic limitations - wearing heavy metallic armour emits audible clinking sounds, and reflects light, and moving more slowly decreases the volume of footsteps. Stealth in "Darkfall" is also made possible through the deliberate lack of showing players on the minimap and use of first-person perspective for ranged combat and general movement.
The Darkfall world.
Geography.
"Darkfall" claims to feature one of the largest online worlds of any MMORPG created to date. The "Darkfall" world consists of a large, central continent named Agon, on which all six racial capitals are found, surrounded by four smaller continents to the north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west. In addition, there are numerous small islands and archipelagos. It was estimated by one of the developers before release that it would take roughly eight hours for a human to run from one end to the other. In reality, the time to cross the main continent is closer to 4 hours, stretching the time to cross the map on a diagonal up to around six. (For comparison, Blizzard's World of Warcraft continent of Eastern Kingdoms is three hours from north to south.)
The world includes a wide range of diverse terrain types, including forest, plain, desert, ice, jungle/tropical, swamp, and wasteland areas. Every part of the "Darkfall" world has been handmade by the developers and not computer generated. "Darkfall" developers have stated that any/all terrain can be accessed and traversed by characters possessing the appropriate skills, e.g. mountains may be climbed by those who possess the ability to climb; islands may be reached by swimming.
Monster spawns and AI.
Darkfall has a relatively small number of mob spawns relative to land mass compared to contemporary MMORPGs, in an attempt to reflect a more "realistic" style. Mobs also display generally higher artificial intelligence than in other games, and will frequently call for help, strategically retreat, dodge, and switch between melee and ranged attacks. Consequently, mobs are generally more difficult than in other MMOGs, to the extent that widescale mob rebalancing was a specific focus for the recent Darkfall expansion. The December patch of Darkfall further improved the AI of the mobs, making them even more difficult to take down.
Wild creatures.
In order for the world to feel more alive and add new elements to the gameplay, the most recent patch of Darkfall included non-aggressive wild animals (such as deer) that players can hunt. They provide a number of resources.
Dungeons.
As is typical of any fantasy MMORPG, "Darkfall" features several dungeons and underground areas. Both the Alfar and Dwarven racial capital cities are located predominantly underground. It should be noted that the dungeons in the world of Agon are not traditionally "instanced" like in other games. An instance is a separate game universe that a group of people are taken to when entering a dungeon so they can fight through the dungeon alone. In Darkfall the dungeons are available for everyone, and are not instanced—so-called open world dungeons as were the norm in first-generation MMORPGs such as EverQuest. The most notable effect of this is that players are fighting with other groups of people that are in the same dungeon in the non-instanced world. This is a result of the fact that the entire game world is seamless; everyone on a given server is sharing the same game session, from towns to dungeons.
Development history.
On 29 August 2001, Razorwax announced the development of "Darkfall" and launched its official website. The Razorwax development team was based in Oslo, Norway, and initially consisted of five members: Claus Grovdal (Lead Design and Producer), Ricki Sickenger (Lead Tools and Game Logic Programmer), Henning Ludvigsen (Art Director), Kjetil Helland (Lead 3D/Client Programmer), and Erik Sperling Johansen (Lead Server Programmer). Approximately 14 months later, in October 2002, the Razorwax team was integrated into Aventurine SA, a newly formed company based in Athens, Greece, ostensibly created for the continued development and subsequent commercialisation of "Darkfall". When the Razorwax team and the Aventurine team had their first meeting in Athens, a member of one of the teams joked that Razorwax should relocate from Norway to Greece due to the lower taxes and cost of living in Greece. Eventually, the two teams realised that this idea actually made very good business sense, and by December 2002, the relocation of Razorwax, now Aventurine, was finalised.
In September 2005, a signup page for a closed clan beta was made available on the web; this beta never happened, however a 1.5 minute "Darkfall" gameplay video was released on February 2006 as recompense to the community. A later statement from associate producer Tasos Flambouras explained that a decision had been made internally to devote additional money and resources into expanding the scope of the game.
"Darkfall"'s first major public revelation was at the game convention E3 in 2006, and while Aventurine did not have a publicly playable version at the time, various industry journalists were shown a standalone demonstration version of the game. From June 2006 onwards, just after E3, the "Darkfall" development team began releasing bi-weekly developer journals and community question/answer articles, published on the game forum site Warcry.
An announcement on the 11 July 2006 stated that preparations were being made to begin beta, although Aventurine stated it did not have a publisher for "Darkfall" at this time, and that they were considering the possibility of self-publishing the game. Six months later, on 17 January 2007, Aventurine announced they were in active discussions with prospective partners, distributors, publishers, and technology providers, and that a fully functional and stable beta build was running on remote servers.
On the 30 January 2007, Aventurine released their second official gameplay video, consisting of about one minute of ingame footage demonstrating real-time melee combat, mounts (including mounted combat), spellcasting and naval combat. In May Aventurine gave an update on their progress towards beta, announcing that their internal target date for beta was for summer 2007. A later update, on 2 August 2007, stated that beta would not start until negotiations with possible publishers were complete.
On 22 February 2008, Aventurine released a "location test video" depicting various NPC and player-crafted city locations in the game. Later, in April, it was announced that "Darkfall" was feature-complete, and in May, that "... our launch date will be inside 2008, with the public beta preceding it by a few weeks. This is official and internally we're a lot more specific, but pending an announcement, we cannot say more at this time".
In June, Aventurine confirmed they had signed with Greek company AudioVisual Enterprises to distribute "Darkfall" in Europe, and this was confirmed by AudioVisual in a stock market announcement made to the Greek stock exchange.
On 29 August 2008, "Darkfall"'s official beta was announced as the final scene of a 17-minute gameplay video, which demonstrated numerous aspects of the game, such as small and large group PVP, including small and large group mounted combat, ship sailing and naval combat, magic and archery, and vehicular combat, creative use of in-game physics and magic, crafting, banking, 3 different PVE encounters demonstrating mob AI, and city building and sieging. This was soon followed by a "limited public hardware test" of "Darkfall" as the first phase of public beta, which was then followed by a staged gameplay-oriented public beta.
On 16 October 2008, "Darkfall" was publicly presented at Athens Digital Week. This event was unofficially reported by a member of the "Darkfall" forum moderators during this event, including a 30 minute video of "Darkfall" played live on stage.
On 5 December 2008, Tasos Flambouras announced that "Darkfall" would be released for the European market on 22 January 2009, with an American release to follow. This launch date was later revised to 25 February 2009. The NDA for beta players was lifted on the 18th of February.
On 24 June 2009, Tasos announced that "Darkfall" will launch in North America on 7 July 2009, alongside Darkfall's first free expansion to the game. Darkfall launched successfully in N. America on July 13, 2009.
Darkfall's first free expansion launched in July and features massive monster re-balancing, player housing, Darkfall's village system, the Nexus system, a character specialization system, the weather system, special items, new weapons and much more.
Darkfall's second free expansion launched early December 2009. The EU-1 server went down late on Thursday December 3 and the North American Server went down shortly after for patching. The update was the largest the game has seen to date and added many desired dynamics to the game not seen in the games first 9 months. Shortly before both servers went live extensive patch notes were released for the 2nd expansion titled "Conquer the Seas".
On June 11, 2010 Darkfall developers released patch outlines which outlined critical fixes to the game. These fixes are some of the most important changes made to Darkfall to date.
On February 10, 2011 Darkfall developers released yet another patch which addressed several issues that had major effects on gameplay. Three Notable changes were clan bank permissions, War Status Timouts (7 days from declaration), and bindstone mechanics designating where you will spawn in the event changes in political affiliation and alignment 
April 25, 2011 Aventurine changed hosting locations to Chicago to improve server stability.
July 2, 2012 Aventurine releases the Ultimate Promotion patch. Increasing skill gains and loot while removing the purchase fee entirely and reducing monthly subscription cost to $9.95, down from $15. This promotion will run from release until the launch of Darkfall 2.0.
On September 18, Aventurine announced Darkfall Unholy Wars. The game was due to launch on November 20. On 14 November, Aventurine announced that due to a combination of external factors, last minute issues, and final testing feedback, the company was forced to push back the release date to December 12, 2012. Darkfall Unholy Wars is set again in the fantasy world of Agon, countless centuries after the events that took place in the original Darkfall Online. The company has released a set of feature, game play and developer diary videos to support the launch (http://www.youtube.com/user/DarkfallOnline)
Launch.
The game went live on February 26, 2009, 9:00 AM GMT +1, twelve hours after the announced launch time. The launch saw a number of setbacks due to unexpected high demand; players stumbled upon a critical bug which the developers took the game down to fix, and Aventurine's website was unable to handle the overwhelming amount of traffic to the online store and forums, causing those features to become generally unavailable to customers for several hours. It was also reported by Aventurine that there were problems with the pre-order system. As a result of these problems, customers were awarded with 4 days free game time.
The game launched on multiple online outlets such as Impulse on July 1, 2010.
Subscription model.
The game client was to be sold for $29.95 USD, but was changed to $39.95 USD a little before release, which includes one month of game time. A monthly subscription fee of $14.99/month is required to continue playing, with options for discounted longer-term subscription.
After the first anniversary of Darkfall's launch, a 7-day trial was offered for €1. In May 2010 the trial offer was retired, replaced in June 2010 with a 14-day free trial.
In October 2012, Aventurine announced the following: "Today we stopped charging for Darkfall Online since we’re going to shut down the Darkfall Online service in a month, on November 15th, to make more room for Darkfall Unholy Wars".
Reception.
MMORPG.com gave Darkfall 6/10, praising its innovations, concepts and world design, but criticizing the lack of polish and the missing elements promised before the final release. In early January a re-review was posted giving Darkfall a 7.2/10, praising its clan battles and skill system, but criticizing grinding.
Game Observer gives Darkfall an overall score of 83/100.
Eurogamer game reviewer Ed Zitron awarded the game a rating of 2 out of 10. However, this review was not received well as it contained several basic gameplay description errors, and Darkfall lead developer Tasos Flambouras claims that game server logs show that the Eurogamer reviewer played the game for under three hours, a claim denied by the writer. Eurogamer's subsequent offer to compromise by commissioning a second opinion review (by noted games critic Kieron Gillen) was declined by Flambouras, but was carried out anyway, being awarded 4/10.

OpenTherm

OpenTherm (short: OT) is a standard communications protocol used in central heating systems for the communication between a central heating boiler and a thermostatic controller.
As a standard, OpenTherm is independent of any single manufacturer. A controller from manufacturer A can in principle be used to control a boiler from manufacturer B. However, OpenTherm controllers and boilers do not in fact always work properly together. The OpenTherm standard comprises a number of optional features and some devices may include manufacturer-specific features. The presence or absence of such features may impair compatibility with other OpenTherm devices.
How OpenTherm works.
Communication is digital and bi-directional between the controller (master) and the boiler (slave). Various commands and kinds of information can be transferred; however, the most basic command is to set the boiler's target water temperature.
OpenTherm makes use of a traditional untwisted 2-wire cable between controller and boiler.
OpenTherm is not polarity sensitive: wires can be swapped.
The maximum wiring length is 50m up to maximum 2 x 5 ohm resistance.
For backward compatibility with traditional switching thermostatic controllers, OpenTherm specified that if the two wires are connected together then the boiler will switch on.
OpenTherm/Plus (OT/+).
The two wires are used both to supply power to the controller and for bidirectional digital communication between the controller and the boiler.
The minimal available power is 35 mW. When using OpenTherm Smart Power this can, by master request, also be 136 mW (medium power) or 255 mW (high power).
The controller transmits to the boiler by sending a Manchester-encoded sequence in the Voltage domain. The boiler transmits data back to the controller in the current domain.
OpenTherm specifies a maximum communications interval of one second. The data in the communication packet is functionally specified and is called OpenTherm-ID (OT-ID). 256 OT-IDs are available, 128 are reserved for OEM use. The other 128 are reserved, 90 of them are functionally specified. (OT specification v3.0)
OpenTherm/Lite (OT/-).
When OT/- is used the master generates a PWM voltage signal, representing the boiler water temperature set point. The boiler current signal indicates the status of the boiler: error, no error.
Due to the limited possibilities OT/- is rarely used .
OpenTherm Smart Power.
On June 16, 2008 OpenTherm specification 3.0 is approved by the association. This version introduces OpenTherm Smart Power. The master can request the slave to change the available power to low, medium or high power. With this master manufacturers can add more functionality to their products (backlight or extra sensors).
Multi Point to Point.
Specification 3.0 also describes how more than two devices can be connected by OpenTherm. Whilst OpenTherm is a point-to-point connection, an extra device (gateway) is added between the master and the slave. This gateway has 1 slave and 1 (or more) master interfaces. The gateway controls which data is passed to each slave.
An application example is a room temperature controller connected to a heat recovery unit, which is connected to a boiler. The heat recovery unit is then functioning as gateway.
In another possible configuration, a thermostat or room controller is connected to a sequencer with further Opentherm interfaces connected to more than one boiler. The room controller can be a standard unit, since it only 'sees' one heat-producer. The sequencer includes additional software to increase or decrease the number of running boilers to match the actual heat demand. The sequencer also needs a sensor to measure the temperature of the combined output from the boilers and usually would also control a main circulation pump. What happens after a fault occurs (resequencing remaining units, passing fault messages through for display on the room controller, etc.) is also part of the sequencer functionality. (The hydraulic design of such a system must also take account of different combinations of boilers running at the same time: a Low Loss Header / Hydraulic Separator is usually included to combine the flows from the boilers.)
Certifying products.
Manufacturers are allowed to market OpenTherm products when they comply with some rules of the OpenTherm association. Most importantly the manufacturer has to be an OpenTherm member, and the product must be tested by an independent testing body.
By handing over the test report and a Declaration of Conformity to the association, the manufacturer is allowed to use the OpenTherm logo.
History.
OpenTherm was founded because multiple manufacturers needed a simple-to-use communicating system between room controller and boiler. It had to run, like the existing controllers, over the existing two wires, not polarity sensitive, without the use of batteries.
For one British Pound, Honeywell sold the first specification to the OpenTherm Association on November 1996. Shortly after the first products appeared on the market.
The Association has grown since then to around 42 members (2008) and has regularly updated and improved the specification. Furthermore, the Association is also active in lobbying for the interests of its members and is also present at exhibitions like the ISH (Frankfurt) and the Mostra Convegno (Milan)
Specification documents.
The protocol specifications document: Protocol specification (v2.2).
Document used for certification: Test Specification.
The document Application Functional Specification describes different applications and how the OpenTherm ID’s are to be used. In addition implementation tips are given.

Seaton Burn

Seaton Burn is a village in Tyne and Wear, England to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, and adjacent to Wideopen. The A1 used to pass through the village but now bypasses the village just to the west, where it meets the A19 which is the link road to the Tyne Tunnel.
Economy.
Seaton Burn Colliery opened in 1844. By October 1852 the colliery was owned by John Bowes & Co. Employment rose to 1,311 in 1921, and steadily fell after that until it was closed by the National Coal Board on 17 August 1965. Little now remains of the mine except for the old railway line leading southeast from the village. This linked with the line from the mine at Weetslade and then went east to link with both the East Coast Main Line and the line leading south to Percy Main. The old track bed has now been established as a cycleway and leads to a quite extensive cycle network in North Tyneside.
Landmarks.
Seaton Burn is a stream that flows through southeastern Northumberland and reaches the North Sea at Seaton Sluice, after running through Holywell Dene.

Kingdom of Derge

The Kingdom of Derge was an important kingdom in Eastern Tibet from the 15th to the 19th century. It was a center of industry, religion and politics, with the seat of its kingdom in the town of Derge. The kings of Derge followed a 1300-year lineage.
At its height, the population of the kingdom consisted of 12,000 to 15,000 families. The northern border of the kingdom was defined by Qinghai Lake; on the east, the boundary terminated at those states that utilized the Horpa variation of the Rgyalrongic languages, Chantui and Litang; the southern and western boundaries were defined by Batang, Sanai, Gonjo and Draya; and Lhato and Ch'amdo, respectively.
The kingdom was known for its metal working and was an important center in the establishment of the Rime movement in Tibetan Buddhism. The royal family of Derge were known as supporters of art, producing such artists as Situ Panchen, the kingdom's senior court chaplain, who is also known for his contributions to medicine and religion. Regent Queen Tsewang Lhamo (d. 1812) was known for her support of printing and publishing.
History.
Derge became the capital of the kingdom in the 15th century under the reign of Lodro Tobden, the 31st in the line of the Derge kings. It was he who invited Thang Tong Gyalpo to establish the renowned Gongchen Monastery in the region. The kingdom expanded during the 18th century under the reign of Tenpa Tsering, who conquered territories to the north.
In 1727, the Kingdom of Derge and other regions in Eastern Tibet fell under the governance of China. It is linked with others of the "more important districts", as Spencer Chapman termed them, such as Nyarong, Batang, Litang, and the five Hor States under the name "Kham", which Chapman describes as "an indefinite term suitable to the Tibetan Government, who are disconcertingly vague over such details as treaties and boundaries." In 1733. The Yongzheng Emperor granted the king of Derge status of "Hsuan Wei Ssu", a high position for native chieftains which effectively permitted him independence, though he was responsible for paying tribute. In spite of the change of provenance, the kings of the region continued their internal struggles, and in 1863, rule of the kingdom was disrupted for two years by the successful invasion of Nyarong. Intervention by the army of Tibet restored the kingdom, following a brief intermediate governance.
In the early 1900s, Eric R. Coales prepared a report that included information about the "recent" history of the kingdom for the British. According to Coales' report, in 1895, the Governor-General of Szechuan sent forces into Chantui, led by General Chang Chi, who advanced further into Derge. The king and his family were imprisoned in Chengdu. By the time political intrigue in China had forced the troops to withdraw, the king had died, leaving behind two sons, Doje Senkel and Djembel Rinch'en. The former of these enjoyed the support of the Chinese, but the latter, who may have been illegitimate, had backers in Chantui. The two struggled over the throne until 1908, when Doje Senkel appealed for assistance to the Chinese General Chao Eh-Feng, who was on military campaign in the area to secure the political primacy of China. Djembel Rinch'en was driven to take sanctuary with the Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso; Doje Senkel yielded the kingdom to China in exchange for an allowance. The Chinese retained direct control of Derge until 1918.
The palace of the Derge kings was subsequently converted into a school.

Languages of Uttar Pradesh

The languages of Uttar Pradesh belong to two zones in the Indo-Aryan languages, the Central and the Eastern.
Individual mother tongues in Uttar Pradesh are many, but well-recognised dialects number around 6 or 7.
History.
The languages of Uttar Pradesh mainly derive from the Prakrits of the Old Indo-Aryan, along with the influence of Persian in the medieval era.
Inventories.
Linguists generally distinguish the terms "language" and "dialects" on the basis of 'mutual comprehension'. The Indian census uses two specific classifications in its own unique way: (1) 'language' and (2) 'mother tongue'. The 'mother tongues' are grouped within each 'language'. Many 'mother tongues' so defined would be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is specifically the case for many 'mother tongues' with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the 'language' Hindi.
Language families.
The dominant language family of Uttar Pradesh is Indo-Aryan, with the two major zones represented being Central and Eastern. Except for Bhojpuri, which belongs to the Eastern zone of Indo-Aryan, the rest of the languages belong to the Central zone.
Official languages.
The languages of state administration are Hindi, established by the Uttar Pradesh Official Language Act, 1951, and Urdu, established by the Amendment to the same in 1989.
Language movements.
The Nagari Pracharini Sabha was formed in 1893 to promote the usage of the Devanagari script.

Brown-banded carder bee

The brown-banded carder bee ("Bombus humilis") is a bumblebee found in most of Europe west of Russia, with the exception of Ireland and Iceland. It is also found in Turkey, on the Tibetan plateau and in northern China. In Britain, it is limited to the coast and chalkland areas of southern England.
Description.
The brown-banded carder bee is medium-sized with a relatively long tongue. The queen is long, the worker .
The thorax is usually yellow-orange on top, with beige flanks, but may be dark brown. Most of the abdomen is beige, too, although with a somewhat striped effect. Both queens (the reproductive females) and workers usually have a broad, dark brown band (hence the common name) on the upper side of the abdomen, near the front, although it can be missing on some workers. A few black hairs - may only be one or two – are present on the thorax near the wing-bases. Males are similar to queens, but they lack stings and have longer antennae. 
Its flight period lasts from about May to September. The queen emerges from hibernation in the spring and makes a nest on the surface of the ground, preferable among grass tufts. The size of the nest is quite small, usually less than 100 inhabitants.
Habitat.
The brown-banded carder bee favours vast grasslands. In Central Asia, it is an alpine species, living at altitudes of . Among the plants visited are "Trifolium pratense" (red clover), "Centaurea" (knapweed) and "Vicia" (vetches).
Threats.
The brown-banded carder bee is threatened by habitat loss due to intensive farming. As Goulson, Hanley, Darvill, Ellis, and Knight have pointed out, a contributing factor in the northern part of its distribution (including Britain) is that "B. humilis", being near the edge of its latitudinal range, is not well adapted to local conditions, so is sensitive to habitat changes, especially loss of unimproved grassland meadows.

Situ Panchen

Situ Panchen (full name Situ Panchen Chögyi Jungney) (1700-1774), also known as the 8th Tai Situ Rinpoche, was an influential Tibetan painter, writer and medical innovator as well as a notable figure in the histories of Karma Kagyu and the Kingdom of Dêgê, where he served as senior court chaplain.
The birth of the eighth Situpa, Chokyi Jungne, was recorded in many texts and literatures, and many great masters made the prophecies of his arrival. For example, the 11th Karmapa, Yeshe Dorje, ever predicted the place where Chokyi Jungne was born.
The eighth Kenting Tai Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1700-1774), was born in the province of A-Lo Shega at Atarong as the prophecy. His father was Ngawang Tsering and his mother Tranguma.
When Chokyi Jungne was born, lama Kunchen, a master of the Treasure Transmission Lineage, performed Dorje Drolo ceremony for him and gave him the name "Gonpo Sun".
At the age of two years, lama Kunchen took him to Tsurphu monastery to see the 11th Karmapa. The Karmapa gave lama Kunchen a silk bag full of big black pills, a pearl with no eye, and a prophecy letter written "Situ, the golden dragon, born at A-Lo". The 11th Karmapa asked lama Kunchen to offer all these to the incarnation of Kenting Tai Situpa. Chokyi Jungne in consequence was recognized to be the incarnation of the 7th Kenting Tai Situpa.
At the age of five years, Chokyi Jungne began to learn to read and write Tibetan from his father, and performed a Vajravarahi (Dorje pagmo, Vajra Yogini) ceremony taught by lama Kunchen.
At the age of seven years,the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup conferred a longevity prayer on him, and conferred the name "Situ Chokyi Jungne Trinley Kunkyab Palzangpo".
At the age of eight years, Chokyi Jungne visited the 12th Karmapa Changchub Dorje.
At the age of nine years, Chokyi Jungne suffered from a serious illness because one relative of his father put poison in his food for sake of jealousy. Two months later, he was on the mend, but he still could not stand or just sit. He lay on the bed and read twice all the literatures in Paljor monastery. At the same time, Chokyi Jungne also learned five knowledge, India local language and Sanskrit. He could communicate with people precisely and fluently in Chinese, Sanskrit, or Mongol. Only a little teaching, he could become skillful in all kind of painting, carving... etc., even better than those who learned these skills for their whole lives. In short, Chokyi Jungne became famous as "thorough knowledge".
At the age of fourteen years, he was recognized according to predictions left by Karmapa Mikyo Dorje, by Terton Sangye Lingpa, Takshampa Mingyur Dorje and by the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup. He was taken to Tsurphu monastery for his enthronement and he received all the teachings and empowerments and studied philosophy and medicine from Karmapa Jangchub Dorje, Shamar Rinpoche, and Rigzin Tsewang Norbu.
At the age of twenty two years, Chokyi Jungne convened scholars in He-Le to transcribe Tengyur based on the transcript kept in Chiwa-Datse. After completing the transcribing in two months, he traveled west to Nepal on pilgrimage, discussing knowledge with many scholars.
At the age of twenty three years, he visited Ladakh and performed an empowerment for the king and his family. Then, he returned to Paljor monastery. At that period of time, he painted a set of thangkhas of eight mahasiddhas using the style of Gadri school of painting, and offered them to the king of Derge.
On the second day of the third month in the female fire sheep year (1727), at the age of twenty eight years, Chokyi Jungne, under the permission of the king of Derge, he began to found the great Palpung monastery, and accomplished the founding on the tenth day of the eighth month in the year. He also built and restored countless other monasteries throughout his life. Palpung Monastery became the main seat of the Kenting Tai Situpas, and it was the inspiration for the founding of Palpung Sherab Ling Monastery in India by the 12th Kenting Tai Situpa Pema Donyo Nyinjey centuries later.
Chokyi Jungne revised texts of Kagyur, Tengyur of Derge transcript, and many literatures in order to make print plates of them. His disciple, Tenpa Tsering, the King of Derge, established the Derge Printing Press. Chokyi Jungne successively helped the Derge Printing Press to produce over 500,000 wood block prints. These prints are such fine quality that the major ones have been reprinted in modern editions and circulated to Tibetan archives in libraries throughout the world.
About Derge Printing Press
Chokyi Jungne painted a series of thangkhas which descript stories of Buddha Shakyamuni. These thangkhas which were painted in Indian style, decorated with imitated China embroideries, were very different form the existed Gadri school in layout, outline and colors, and called the new Gadri school (Karma Gadri). Chokyi Jungne also painted many other thangkhas and made many sculptures, which all enrich the Tibetan art culture.
At the age of thirty years, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the third time. He visited Tsurphu monastery for the opening of a great statue. Then he stayed in Tibet on pilgrimage and teaching for four years.
In the wood mouse year, Chokyi Jungne completed the famous linguistic literature "Situ's Commentary of Tibetan Grammar". The grammar is still used as senior grammar in Tibet today.
In the wood cow year, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the fourth time. He recognized and enthroned the new Shamarpa. Then he visited Nepal again on pilgrimage and was highly honored there. Once, after a debate with Pandita Jaya Mangola of Kashmir, it was proclaimed by the local Hindus that Kenting Tai Situpa must have been blessed by the Lord Shiva, since that was the only way he could have achieved such insight and learning.
At the age of fifty years, according to the Tibetan medical texts Chokyi Jungne made the famous medical pill "Moon Nectar Pill". In the fire mouse year, he made one kind of special pills which grew themselves more and more and spilled out of the bottle, and then the pills became all kind of Buddha. Afterwards, Chokyi Jungne performed more experiments and made many special pills. He became a skilled physician and a master of Tibetan medicine. He composed and wrote some medical books, which were deemed as valuable medical guidance still now.
At the age of sixty years, The Kenting Tai Situpa visited Jangsadam, south of China, for the second time. In there, he lightened the lamp of Buddha Dharma, rebuilt thirteen monasteries of Kagyu school. In the same period of time, he translated many texts from Sanskrit, including prayers to Bodhisattva Tara.
He also visited China at the invitation of the Qianlong Emperor (1735-1796) and was highly honored.
At the age of sixty three years, he visited Tibet on pilgrimage for the fifth time. He retreated in a Drikung monastery. At that time, when he performed any kind of offering ceremony, a miracle emanation vision of Dorje Drolo showed up. Once in a Tara fire offering ceremony, the tent he slept grew many blue lotuses. In usual time, he kept reciting mantras except short rest time at noon and night. He recited three hundred million times of all kind of mantras. He showed many miracles like just an intention to stop a rainstorm, spreading barley to the sky and the barley straightened on the ground.
He found and recognized the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje, and personally taught the Karmapa and imparted the complete linage to him.
At the age of seventy two years, Chokyi Jungne invited the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje to Palpung monastery. He performed Taisho Tripitaka lineage empowerments and teachings for the Karmapa. At that time, the sky was filled of colorful clouds, a sacred sign enhancing people's faith to the 13th Karmapa.
In 1774, at the age of seventy four years, Chokyi Jungne was invited to China. On the way to China, while meditating in the lotus posture of a Buddha, the Kenting Tai Situpa died. It was observed that his heart-region retained heat for seven days and there was a strong smell of incense everywhere. Kenting Tai Situpa predicted his next rebirth before his passing.
The 8th Kenting Tai Situpa was one of the most famous masters in Tibetan history. He was acknowledged as a supreme scholar who had no equal in the five knowledge. He is honored a unique title "Maha Pandita". His fame reached well beyond the borders of Tibet at this time. He also built or rebuilt many monasteries of different lineages. These monasteries became Palpung's satellite monasteries, even in mainland China, exceeding well beyond a hundred.
It is said that his limitless activities were equal to those of Nagajuna's in India. It was also a common saying at the time, that if all of the other Kagyu monasteries came together, their activity wouldn't be equal to that of Situ Chokyi Jungne.
His foremost disciples were the thirteenth Karmapa, the tenth Shamarpa, Gyalwang Drukpa Trinley Shingta, Drikung Chokyi Gyalwa, Pawo Tsuklag Gyalwa, Drubtop Choje Gyal, Khamtrul Chokyi Nyima, and Lotsawa Tsewang Kunchab.

Etruscan military history

The Etruscans, like the contemporary cultures of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome had a persistent military tradition. In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals in Etruscan culture, warfare was a considerable economic boon to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months; raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating piracy as a means of acquiring valuable resources such as land, prestige goods and slaves. It is also likely individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs to honor fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made by Achilles for Patroclus.
Significant battles.
The written record of the period of Etruscan is fragmentary but it is generally believed that The Etruscans vied with the early Romans for control of the central Italian Peninsula for nearly two centuries (c.700 B.C. - c.500 B.C.) before becoming one of the first neighboring cultures to succumb to Roman expansion.
In the Battle of Cumae (474 B.C.), the Etruscans and allies were defeated in the waters off Cumae by the combined navies of Cumae and Syracuse. This defeat successfully blocked the southern expansion of Etruscan influence and marked the beginning of territorial loss in southern Italy. In the Roman-Etruscan Wars, Roman authors wrote accounts of a drawn out siege on the city of Veii. According to the Roces, the army of Rome unsuccessfully laid siege to the Etruscan city of Veii for 9 years before they were able to tunnel beneath the walls of the city and bring about Veii's downfall. The veracity of the account is difficult to determine, because the accounts are told as part of the biography of Marcus Furius Camillus, a legendary figure in Roman history. Livy and Plutarch wrote about Camillus long after his death.
Equipment.
In addition to written sources, the archaeological record provides evidence for the Etruscan military and warfare. Tombs of wealthy Etruscans consistently contain either representative sculpture of weaponry and armour, or the items themselves. The varieties of shields, helms, armour and weaponry vary according to date and location, but can still be organized into broad stylistic categories.
Several Etruscan shields have been recovered from Etruscan grave sites. The shields are traditionally decorated bronze circular disks measuring around a yard across. Earlier Etruscan shields are flat and later examples have a slightly convex curve across the body of the shield. The later styles bear close resemblance to contemporary Greek models. There are several helmet designs found at Etruscan sites, the most distinctively Etruscan being the so-called “crested helm” variety. The crest is fashioned by joining two embossed plates (or "laminae") into a high peak pointed crest. The high crest is frequently embossed with decoration. In addition to the Crested Helm a number of other varieties of helms have been found in Etruscan tombs. Often the design is a semi-spherical cap, with no decoration or with appliques. Another variation to the common semispherical cap is cheek guards attached by hinges. 
Both swords and spears are frequently found at Etruscan tomb sites. Few examples of Etruscan swords survive in good condition, often only fragments of heavily oxidized blades. What does survive are generally robust spear points and wide blades not unlike early Roman weaponry. The bronze armour of the Etruscans is similar in style to that of the Greeks. One example from Tarquinia was two solid pieces connected by hinges at the hips and on either side of the neck. The example was anatomical in design, meaning the bronze plates were fashioned to look like the chest and back of a robust man. Another example this one from the Narce Tomb's, northwest of the city of Rome, was from an earlier date and decorated like the Crested Helm. The Narce Tomb breast plate evidently would have restricted the range of motion considerable more and has led to hypotheses that it was intended for a stationary commander. Anatomical greaves have also been found in Etruscan tombs.
Some of what is known about the arms and armour of the Etruscans is not based on actual equipment but rather sculpted duplicates. “The Tomb of Reliefs” at Cerveteri is a rock-hewn tomb with relief and stucco relief work painted to look as if the dead would be provided with all necessary goods to live comfortably in the tomb. This tomb provides a great deal of beneficial insight to the several types of Etruscan material culture including weapons. Among the decorations were a number of life sized weapons, items of armour and shields.

XPages

XPages is a rapid web and mobile application development technology. It allows data from IBM Lotus Notes (now branded simply 'IBM Notes') and Relational Databases to be displayed to browser clients on all platforms.
The programming model is based on web development languages and standards including JavaScript, Ajax, Java, the Dojo Toolkit, Server-side JavaScript and JavaServer Faces. XPages uses IBM Lotus Domino, IBM's rapid application development platform, including functionality such as the document-oriented database.
Frontend technologies.
By utilizing web standards, XPages applications can be accessed by web clients and mobile devices, allowing the developer to deliver cross-platform applications. For the user interface, XPages focus on the web development standards HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally themes can be used to manage multiple CSS files, and XPages comes with default themes, for example the OneUI theme.
For client side logic various JavaScript frameworks can be used, though XPages comes with the Dojo Toolkit and Dojo controls can be easily referenced in XPages applications. XPages also uses Dojo internally for certain functionality to make key features easier to use without having to write Dojo code. A special XPages JavaScript library contains further convenience functionality, for example for client side field validations. In addition to client side logic Dojo can also be used for rich user interface widgets and charts.
As any web application XPages applications can use REST services. XPages also provides easy mechanisms to bind data sources to UI controls so that for many scenarios no code needs to be written. Additionally XPages allows to declaratively only refresh parts of the page via Ajax when submitting data.
Backend technologies.
The development of XPages applications is done using IBM Lotus Domino Designer. With Designer many key scenarios can be implemented declaratively and rapidly, for example to render a list of entries from a database. Additionally for the business logic both JavaScript and Java code can be written. XPages base internally on JavaServer Faces, but the sources of a XPages pages are an XML derivative called XSP which is translated into Java code when running the applications. At runtime, this code returns the HTML to various clients.
In order to access data, XPages and Domino Designer use "data sources". These data sources can be bound graphically to UI controls on pages. UI controls and other types of controls show up in a palette of controls in Domino Designer and can be dragged and dropped onto pages. Domino Designer also comes with further convenience functionality, such as field validations and translations. XPages functionality can be modularized in "Custom Controls" which are XPages controls that can be reused in multiple XPages pages and parametrized based on context.
In order to write business backend code Serverside JavaScript is used primarily. There are APIs to access the document oriented database and the XPages context. Since XPages are based on JSF and JSF is a Java standard it is also possible to invoke standard Java SDK code from the JavaScript code and to write custom Java code using JSF managed beans. 
The XPages runtime can be extended using the Extensibility API which is based on JavaServer Faces. This capability can for example be used by ISVs who want to provide their own libraries of XPages controls.
Storage: Document-oriented Database.
The XPages runtime is part of IBM Lotus Domino and leverages the proven and mature capabilities Domino provides. Domino uses a document-oriented database called NSF (Notes Storage Facility) to manage semi-structured data like rich text and files. The data is stored as documents and views allow finding specific documents efficiently. Documents have unique ids and further built in fields like the last author, last modified date, etc. and they have custom application specific fields. Documents can contain rich text which can be formatted text and images (MIME) or full file attachments. Documents can be queried via APIs and views. Lotus Domino also supports full text search for a full database as built in feature.
XPages applications can easily be deployed on Domino servers or a cluster of Domino servers using IBM Lotus Domino Administrator and more precisely the replication/synchronization mechanism built into IBM Lotus Domino. The replication mechanism supports bi-directional conflict detection and resolution in distributed environments.
Community.
The XPages development community manages the website XPages.info with various types of information about XPages, including how to get started, downloads, resources and demos. 
OpenNTF is an open source site for applications based on IBM Lotus Domino and contains several applications and development controls under the Apache License.
History.
The origins of XPages technology can be traced as far back as year 2000, when Trilog Group, an IBM Business Partner, invented a component-oriented rapid web application development model, called XSP, similar to the Domino RAD model, but based on J2EE, XML and open standards. In August 2004, IBM acquired the XSP technology assets from Trilog Group in an effort to offer a RAD tool for IBM Workplace that is similar to Domino Designer. 
The XPages technology, based upon JSF and J2EE, started life at IBM, from 2005 to 2007, inside the now discontinued IBM Lotus Workplace Designer and subsequently IBM Lotus Component Designer under the code name 'XFaces'. In mid 2007, the XFaces technology became 'XPages' and adopted by IBM Lotus Notes Domino, incorporated in the development cycle for the 8.5 release. XPages was previewed at Lotusphere 2008 (AD303 Transforming IBM Lotus Domino Web Apps with IBM Lotus Domino Designer Speakers: Rocky Oliver, Martin Donnelly). IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5 was released in December 2008 and in time for Lotusphere 2009 where it was one of the many highlights of the show.
IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5.1 continued the development of the XPages technology including the running of XPages applications inside the Notes Client. This release also included several improvements to performance and UI which helped XPages applications perform and scale better. IBM Lotus Notes Domino 8.5.2 contained many more improvements and additions to the feature set of XPages.
The 'XPages' name was inspired from the original XSP naming idea, where XSP was actually an acronym for 'XML Server Pages'. After a first rebranding of XSP to 'XFaces', IBM chose 'XPages' as the project code name for the pre-release technology included in Domino Designer. With a catchy alternative being hard to come by, the project name stuck.

Apache Buildr

Buildr is an open-source build system mainly intended to build Java applications, but capable of doing much more. It gives the developer the power of a full-blown scripting language (Ruby) while writing his or her build scripts, much missed in XML-based building environments like Apache Ant or Apache Maven.
Overview.
Buildr is based on Ruby's build system Rake, and uses Ruby as a scripting language. It uses some project automation idioms from Maven like automated artifact management (Buildr is out-of-box compatible with Maven's repositories). As opposed to more imperative style of build systems like Ant, Buildr takes a more declarative approach in describing the project automation logic (similarly to Maven).
Though Buildr's general philosophy is similar to Maven, it uses Ruby's scripting possibilities to provide a much more flexible and customizable programming model, dramatically extending the tools in the hands of the developer. The user writes a Ruby build script, declaring a project, its sub-projects, artifacts, dependencies, packaging rules, etc. Based on these declarations, a list of standard targets are provided to compile or package the project, upload a prepared package to a remote repository, clean up the build results, run tests and so on. Hooks are provided to execute custom Ruby code before or after the standard targets, allowing the user to comfortably override any defaults and further specify the behavior of the standard targets. New, completely user-written targets can be added, written in Ruby, using its full scripting powers.
Supported Technologies.
While being mainly designed for Java, Buildr also knows how to invoke compilers for Groovy or Scala. It is also easily extendible with any custom tasks to invoke any third compiler, making it a universal, general-purpose build system. As compared with writing custom plug-ins for Ant, Ruby's flexibility 
and rich library make it much easier and quicker to extend Buildr in any desired way.
Buildr also comes with out-of-box support technologies like Cobertura, Emma, JUnit, TestNG, JBehave, JMock. Integration with Ant is also provided.

DSB class P

The class P was a series of steam locomotives of the Danish State Railways, designed by chief mechanical engineer O.F.A. Busse and introduced in 1907. With a wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (2'B1 in UIC classification), they were well suited to express trains, and were the first steam locomotives in Denmark heavier than 100 tonnes. They saw service on most DSB main lines, but were at their best on the relatively level Copenhagen to Korsør and Fredericia to Esbjerg services. 
Due to shortages of powerful locomotives with low axle load during World War II, seven of the class P locomotives were rebuilt to a 4-6-2 arrangement and designated class PR, starting in 1943. Two of the class P locomotives have been preserved, as well as one unit of class PR.

Wildcliff, also referred to as the Cyrus Lawton House, is a historic residence overlooking Long Island Sound in New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. The 20-room house, built in about 1852, was designed by prominent architect Alexander Jackson Davis in the gothic revival style. Tudor architectural features were added by a later owner.
Clara Prince, whose family acquired the house in 1913, donated Wildcliff to the City of New Rochelle in 1940. She intended for it to be used as a natural science museum. It has since been used for that and other purposes, including a performing arts center. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 2002. It had fallen into disrepair, and an extensive restoration project was initiated in 2006 to replace the slate roof and make numerous interior improvements.
Since late 2010, the local organization Jen's Community at Wildcliff has been working with the City of New Rochelle and its citizens to bring awareness to the building and to create a preschool and education center.

Its design was started to Air Ministry specification 24/25 for a high-altitude bomber, but was later modified to meet specification 23/25 for a day bomber, reconnaissance and torpedo aircraft.
The Beagle was a single-bay biplane with staggered and slightly swept wings. The fabric-covered wings, which did not fold as the aircraft was not intended for carrier service, had spruce spars and ribs with metal bracing. Four ailerons were fitted. The fuselage followed standard Blackburn practice with a steel tube centre section and wooden construction aft, though the final section was again of tube steel; covering was fabric throughout. Fin area was small and the rudder large, with a horn balance initially merging into the fin but later reduced, leaving a prominent step rather like of the Nautilus. The braced tailplane had significantly greater elevator than stabiliser area, the former again having prominent horn balances.
The undercarriage was of the split type required by the torpedo dropping role, but a carrier mechanism between the legs could also hold a 185 imp gal (840 L) fuel tank for reconnaissance work. Cockpits were open with the pilot in front, armed with a forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port side. The gunner's cockpit was close to the pilot's for communication. He had a Scarff ring-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun, but to fulfil his role as torpedo or bomb aimer, he moved into a prone position in a station below the pilot's cockpit. This had a bomb sight used via an opening with a sliding door in the bottom of the fuselage and had bomb fusing and release controls plus altitude and airspeed gauges and a hand-operated rudder control for yaw corrections on target.
The Beagle was initially powered by a 460 hp (340 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIIIF radial engine mounted in a smooth and rather pointed nose cone, leaving the tops of the nine cylinders exposed. After the competitive trials it was re-engined with a supercharged 590 hp (440 kW) Jupiter XF, though the extra power seems not to have led to significant performance improvement. This installation had a more pointed cowling, with more cylinder head exposed for better cooling.
The Beagle flew first at Brough Aerodrome on 18 February 1928 piloted by W.S. Bulman. The rudder modification mentioned above was made before the aircraft went to competitive trial.
Operational history.
Trials took place at RAF Martlesham Heath in July 1929, where the Beagle was ranged against the Gloster Goring, the Handley Page Hare, the Hawker Harrier and the Westland Witch. None of these aircraft met the performance requirements, but as it had received favourable handling reports, the Beagle, along with the Vildebeest and Hare, was chosen for further testing. It was re-engined and returned to Martlesham in March 1931. By this time, however, the Vildebeest had already been chosen to meet the RAFs requirements for a torpedo bomber. The Beagle remained operational until October 1933.

Frederick Arm

Frederick Arm is an inlet on the South Coast of British Columbia, extending north from Cordero Channel between Lougborough and Bute Inlets.
Originally conferred with the name Ensenada del Estero by Spanish explorers Galiano and Valdes, its current name was given c.1864 by Captain Pender, RN (namesake of Pender Island), after Staff Commander Frederick John Owen Evans, naval hydrographer, British Admiralty. The name Estero survives in the vicinity in the form of Estero Basin, which lies between the north end of Frederick Arm and the south end of Bute Inlet and Estero Peak, on the south side of Estero Basin. "Estero" means "lagoon", while Ensenada de Estero means "Bay of the Lagoon". San Josef Mountain in the same vicinity was named for the "San Josef", a prize Spanish frigate that was captured by the Royal Navy and became part of the fleet 
Frederick Arm should not be confused with Frederick Sound, which is a sidewater of Seymour Inlet in the area to the north of Queen Charlotte Strait.

Randall was educated at St Peter's School, Seaford, and Canford School.
He worked as a shipping clerk in Brazil in his youth, then returned to the United Kingdom at the start of the Second World War and took a job as a journalist at the "Daily Sketch". In 1941, he moved to the "Sunday Graphic", rising to become its editor in 1953. However, he soon left to become an assistant features editor with the "Daily Mirror", and in 1956 moved on to the "News Chronicle". This paper merged with the "Daily Mail", when Randall joined the "Mail", and he became its editor in 1963, after serving as deputy editor.
Randall aimed to take the "Mail" upmarket, introducing more investigative journalism and attract younger readers with a more liberal position. However, the paper lost readers, and Randall was replaced as editor in 1966 while he was on sick leave. He joined the "Sunday Times" as Managing Editor (News), assisting Editor Harold Evans and co-ordinating investigations. In 1969, Robert Maxwell asked Randall to edit "The Sun" if he was successful in purchasing it, but the deal did not go ahead, and Randall instead retired from the "Sunday Times" in 1979.
In semi-retirement, Randall worked as a fruit picker and on a mushroom farm, while involving himself in the launch of the "Sunday Standard".

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy is a proverb. It means that without time off from work, a person becomes both bored and boring.
History.
Though the spirit of the proverb had been expressed previously, the modern saying appeared first in James Howell's "Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish" (1659), and was included in later collections of proverbs. It also appears in Howell's "Paroimiographia" (1659), p. 12.
Some writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in "Harry and Lucy Concluded" (1825) by the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth:
Uses in popular media.
While the proverb is used in several examples of popular media, from James Joyce's short story "Araby" to Jack Kerouac's "Big Sur" to the 1957 movie "The Bridge on the River Kwai", probably the most famous example appears in the 1980 horror movie "The Shining", directed by Stanley Kubrick, in which the main character, Jack (played by Jack Nicholson), is found to have abandoned his latest novel in favour of typing this sentence over and over onto reams of paper. Kubrick's addition of a psychotic edge to the proverb has had some effect on popular culture, inspiring several other works to include a direct homage to the scene.
In television.
The "Sunday" computer virus, a member of the Jerusalem virus family discovered in 1989, contained a reference to the proverb. Infected files will contain the string "Today is Sunday! Why do you work so hard? All work and no play make you a dull boy! Come on! Let's go out and have some fun!" The virus's payload prints the proverb on the screen and then deletes all files running while the virus is a resident in the memory, as the original Jerusalem did every Friday the 13th.

Charles Buckman Goring

Charles Buckman Goring (1870–1919) was a pioneer in criminology and author of the influential work "".
Life.
He was educated at the University of London, receiving his B.Sc. in 1895 and his M.D. in 1903. In 1893, he was awarded the John Stuart Mill Studentship in Philosophy of Mind and Logic, and four years later was elected a Fellow of University College. From 1902 until his death in 1919, he was employed as medical officer in various English prisons.
He was highly regarded among those who knew him for his scientific imagination, logic and excellent prose. His colleague Karl Pearson once said: "The creative mind has the potentiality of poet, artist and scientist within its grasp, and Goring's friends were never very certain in which category to place him."
"The English convict".
Goring's crowning achievement was "The English convict: a statistical study", one of the most comprehensive criminological works of its time. It was first published in 1913, and set out to establish whether there were any significant physical or mental abormalities among the criminal classes that set them apart from ordinary men, as suggested by Cesare Lombroso. Under the sponsorship of the British government, Goring, assisted by other prison medical officers, as well as Karl Pearson and his staff at the Biometrics Laboratory, collected and analysed data bearing upon 96 traits of each of over 3,000 English convicts. He ultimately concluded that "the physical and mental constitution of both criminal and law-abiding persons, of the same age, stature, class, and intelligence, are identical. There is no such thing as an anthropological criminal type." 
He did, however, assert that it is an "indisputable fact that there is a physical, mental, and moral type of normal person who tends to be convicted of crime: that is to say, our evidence conclusively shows that, on average, the criminal of English prisons is markedly differentiated by defective physique - as measured by stature and body weight, by defective mental capacity". Goring went on to argue that one of the three measures in which to combat crime was to "regulate the reproduction of those degrees of constitutional qualities - feeble-minded, inebriety, epilepsy, social instinct, etc".

The park plays host to many events throughout the year in this small town in Northwest Georgia. Dowdy Park holds many historical stories and facts, time periods ranging from the 19th century up until the first decade of the 21st century. This map gives a general idea of the location of the park.
History.
The park holds many historic landmarks within it. The Couey House is probably the oldest of the landmarks. The Couey House was built in the early 1840s by Andrew McSelland Couey and his sons. These people were one of the first family's to settle in Chattooga county. The house was originally made out of logs that were cleared from the land on which the house was built. However, Dowdy Park is not the original place where the house was built; it was moved there in the 1990s due to highway construction.
Another one of the historic landmarks is the Summerville railroad turntable and the train depot. The depot was constructed in 1889 and added to the Georgia central railroad system in 1901. The depot was used in the filming of two films: one made in 1998 and the other in 2004.

In mathematics, helical boundary conditions are a variation on periodic boundary conditions. Helical boundary conditions provide a method for determining the index of a lattice site's neighbours when each lattice site is indexed by just a single coordinate. On a lattice of dimension "d" where the lattice sites are numbered from 1 to "N" and "L" is the width (i.e. number of elements per row) of the lattice in all but the last dimension, the neighbors of site "i" are:
It is not necessary that "N" = "L""d". Helical boundary conditions make it possible to use only one coordinate to describe arbitrary-dimensional lattices.

Magnhild Haalke was born in Vikna, an island off the Namdalen coast in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway. Before she took up writing she worked as a teacher for 30 years in Sør-Odal. In 1922, she married her second cousin, Hjalmar Kristian Haalke (1894–1964) who was an artist. 
She made her literary debut in 1935 with the novel "Allis sønn". Her deep psychological insight and great environmental descriptions ensured her a lasting place in Norwegian literature. Eventually she wrote nearly 30 books. Haalke made use of strong, colorful language and lush figures of speech. Her novels often focused on adult insensitive treatment of defenseless youth. The role of the mother in childhood development was a frequent subject. In several books she wrote of values relating to childhood environment and family traditions.
Her trilogy "Åkfestet" (1936), "Dagblinket" (1937) and "Rød haust?" (1941) describes the fate of a woman growing up on a small farm. The trilogy was later reworked into "Grys saga" (1950, two books).
The trilogy "Karenanna Velde" (1946), "Kaja Augusta" (1947) and "Kvinneverden" (1954) is from a rural district on the coast of Trøndelag.
Haalke was awarded Gyldendal's Endowment in 1949 and the Dobloug Prize in 1980. She was the first recipient of Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment, which she was awarded in 1953, which she shared with novelist, Lizzie Juvkam (1883–1969). From 1954, she received a national artist salary from the national government.

Cram (game)

Cram is a mathematical game played on a sheet of graph paper. It is the impartial version of Domineering and the only difference in the rules is that each player may place their dominoes in either orientation, but it results in a very different game. It has been called by many names, including "plugg" by Geoffrey Mott-Smith, and "dots-and-pairs." Cram was popularized by Martin Gardner in "Scientific American".
Rules.
The game is played on a sheet of graph paper, with any set of designs traced out. It is most commonly played on rectangular board like a 6×6 square or a checkerboard, but it can also be played on an entirely irregular polygon or a cylindrical board.
Two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn. A player can place a domino either horizontally or vertically. Contrary to the related game of Domineering, the possible moves are the same for the two players, and Cram is then an impartial game.
As for all impartial games, there are two possible conventions for victory : in the normal game, the first player who cannot move loses, and on the contrary, in the misère version, the first player who cannot move wins. 
Symmetry play.
The winning strategy for normal Cram is simple for even-by-even boards and even-by-odd boards. In the even-by-even case, the second player wins by symmetry play. This means that whichever move Player 1 makes, Player 2 has a corresponding symmetric move across the horizontal and vertical axes. In a sense, player 2 "mimics" the moves made by Player 1. If Player 2 follows this strategy, Player 2 will always make the last move, and thus win the game.
In the even-by-odd case, the first player wins by similar symmetry play. Player 1 places his first domino in the center two squares on the grid. Player 2 then makes his move, but Player 1 can play symmetrically thereafter, thus ensuring a win for Player 1.
It should be noted that symmetry play is a useless strategy in the misère version, because in that case it would only ensure the player that he "loses".
Normal version.
Grundy value.
Since Cram is an impartial game, the Sprague–Grundy theorem indicates that in the normal version any Cram position is equivalent to a nim-heap of a given size, also called the "Grundy value". Some values can be found in Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays, in particular the 2 × "n" board, whose value is 0 if "n" is even and 1 if "n" is odd.
The symmetry strategy implies that even-by-even boards have a Grundy value of 0, but in the case of even-by-odd boards it only implies a Grundy value greater or equal to 1.
Known values.
In 2009, Martin Schneider computed the grundy values up to the 3 × 9, 4 × 5 and 5 × 7 boards. In 2010, Julien Lemoine and Simon Viennot applied to the game of Cram algorithms that were initially developed for the game of Sprouts. It allowed them to compute the grundy-values up to the 3 × 18, 4 × 9 and 5 × 8 boards. They were also able to compute the outcome (but not the grundy-value) of the 5 × 9 and 7 × 7 boards.
The sequence of currently known Grundy values for 3 × "n" boards, from n=1 to n=18 is: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, 1. It doesn't show any apparent pattern.
The table below details the known results for boards with both dimensions greater than 4. Since the value of an "n" × "m" board is the same as the value of a "m" × "n" board, we give only the upper part of the table.
Misère version.
Misère Grundy-value.
The misère Grundy-value of a game G is defined by Conway in On Numbers and Games as the unique number n such that G+n is a second player win in misère play. Even if it looks very similar to the usual Grundy-value in normal play, it is not as powerful. In particular, it is not possible to deduce the misère Grundy-value of a sum of games only from their respective misère grundy-values.
Known values.
In 2009, Martin Schneider computed the misère grundy values up to the 3 × 9, 4 × 6, and 5 × 5 board. In 2010, Julien Lemoine and Simon Viennot extended these results up to the 3 × 15, 4 × 9 and 5 × 7 boards, along with the value of the 6 × 6 board.
The sequence of currently known misère Grundy values for 3 × "n" boards, from n=1 to n=15 is: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. This sequence is conjectured to be periodic of period 3.
The table on the right details the known misère results for boards with both dimensions greater than 4.

Frances Epps

Frances Epps (died 1913) was an English writer of educational works for children, a role in which she was particularly gifted. There is no biography, and even her dates of birth and death are unknown.
She was probably the author of "Short Tales for Little Folk", published in 1889 by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. From 1890 she was contributing articles to the "Parents' Review" (a fortnightly aimed at teachers and parents) on subjects such as arithmetic, singing, French, needlework, and one entitled “Work for Gentlewomen as Elementary Schoolmistresses”. More substantially, she also wrote for this "Review" between 1906 and 1908 a series entitled ‘The British Museum for Young People’, describing what could be seen in the British Museum on Roman Britain, ancient Greece, Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria; this was published in book form in 1914.
From 1908 to 1910, she contributed a remarkable series of articles to Arthur Mee's well-known "Children's Encyclopædia" (which first appeared in fortnightly serial form; as the "Parents' Review" was edited by Charlotte Mason, who would have been known by Arthur Mee as he shared her progressive views on education, this was probably the connection.) These articles, entitled "The Child's Book of All Countries", covered their history and geography and often described in vivid terms the life of their people. Here is an example of her style, concerning Britain:
"The labourer must till the earth to give us food; the miner must go down into the earth to fetch us coal, the fisherman must go to sea to bring us fish; the builder must put up houses for us to live in; the postman must carry our letters; the clerk must keep our books; the policeman must keep our streets in order. And so, day by day, the great work of the country is carried on, each man doing his share in helping to make his own life happy and the nation prosperous."
In her articles she reflected current optimism concerning Britain's economic progress and its position in the world. She took pride in the British Empire, while insisting on the moral responsibility of empire, writing that: "There is a duty for the boys and girls of today: of giving to all those peoples a rule merciful and just, peaceful and free." She admired Germany for its industrial and technical progress, for its education system and its emphasis on family life; but she did not foresee the calamitous war which was soon to break out.
The "Children's Encyclopædia", including her articles, had a strong influence over several generations of British children. Frances Epps deserves to be better known, and further information on her would be welcome.

Garbage Dreams

Garbage Dreams is a 2009 feature length documentary film produced and directed by Mai Iskander. Filmed over the course of four years, Garbage Dreams follows three teenage boys growing up in Egypt’s garbage village. Garbage Dreams aired on the PBS program Independent Lens for the occasion of Earth Day 2010 and has been screened in many international film festivals.
Synopsis.
"Garbage Dreams" follows three teenage boys born into the trash trade and growing up in the world's largest garbage village, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt. It is the home to 60,000 Zaballeen, also spelled as Zabbaleen, Arabic for "garbage people." Far ahead of any modern "Green" initiatives, the Zaballeen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect. When their community is suddenly faced with the globalization of its trade, each of the teenage boys is forced to make choices that will impact his future and the survival of his community.
Release.
"Garbage Dreams" premiered at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival where it ran in the US Documentary Competition Garbage Dreams had its international premiere in Europe at the twenty-second International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam
and its Middle Eastern premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival.
Garbage Dreams was shortlisted for the 2010 Academy Awards in the category of Best Feature Length Documentary, was nominated for the 2010 Best Documentary by the Director’s Guild of America, and has won 26 international awards including the Al Gore Reel Current Award and IDA Humanitas Award. 
Garbage Dreams aired on PBS/Independent Lens for the occasion of Earth Day 2010. It has been screened in over 100 international film festivals, including the Woodstock Film Festival, the Hollywood Film Festival, the Bel Air Film Festival, Maryland Film Festival, and the Seattle International Film Festival.
Critical reception.
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore presented the 2009 REEL Current Award to the documentary "Garbage Dreams" at the Nashville Film Festival. Gore, and the writer of "An Inconvenient Truth", presents the award annually to a film that gives outstanding insight into a contemporary global issue.
Gore said of the film, ""Garbage Dreams" is a moving story of young men searching for a ways to eke out a living for their families and facing tough choices as they try to do the right thing for the planet. Mai Iskander guides us into a 'garbage village', a place so different from our own, and yet the choices they face there are so hauntingly familiar. Ultimately, "Garbage Dreams" makes a compelling case that modernization does not always equal progress."
In "Variety" Ronnie Scheib called the film "Stunning debut ... [Iskander's] lensing grants her subjects immense dignity (they never appear "other" in their poverty) and her film its curious beauty."
In her review in "The New York Times", Jeannette Catsoulis said "Expertly weaving personal fears, family tensions and political action, 'Garbage Dreams' records the tremblings of a culture at a crossroads."
In "The Hollywood Reporter" Frank Scheck wrote "Championed by Oscar winner Al Gore and the spur for a million-dollar donation by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, "Garbage Dreams " could ride its sociological importance to Oscar recognition."
In "The Village Voice" Andrew Schenker called "Garbage Dreams" a "handsomely shot and intermittently fascinating look at Cairo's Zaballeen community."

Evergreen Terrace is a five-piece melodic hardcore/metalcore band from Jacksonville, Florida. Formed in 1999, they are named after the street inhabited by The Simpsons. The band's sixth studio album "Dead Horses" was released on December 10, 2013 via Rise Records.
History.
Formed in 1999 by Josh James (guitar), Andrew Carey (vocals), Josh "Woody" Willis (guitar), Josh Smith (bass) and Christopher Brown (drums), the band released one Demo-EP and a Split-EP together with 'Cordelle' within the first year of being a band. Within 8 months of the beginning of the band Woody and Josh Smith were replaced by Craig Chaney (guitar/vocals) and Jason Southwell (bass). In 2001 their debut-album "Losing All Hope Is Freedom" was released via Indianola Records on July 31. Under the same label they released a Split-EP together with xOne Fifthx, on May 20, 2002 titled "xOne Fifthx vs. Evergreen Terrace". Shortly after the release of the split Josh James (guitar) joined xOne Fifthx and continued playing with Evergreen Terrace.
Later in 2002 they signed with Eulogy Recordings and released their second studio-album "Burned Alive by Time" on November 26. After a number of long tours they released a cover-album titled "Writer's Block" in February 2004. The album includes songs from bands like U2, Smashing Pumpkins, and Tears for Fears. In July they released "At Our Worst" which contained live performances, as well as B-Sides from "Burned Alive by Time" and the 4 tracks from the self released Demo-EP. "At Our Worst" was released on Hand of Hope Records, a label started by drummer Chris Brown and Eulogy owner John Wylie. 2004 was also the year the band started touring outside of USA and Canada.
In 2005 they released a live-DVD called "Hotter! Wetter! Stickier! Funner!". The same year they released their third studio-album entitled "Sincerity Is an Easy Disguise in This Business" on June 21. Shortly after, drummer Christopher Brown left the band and replaced by Kyle Mims. The next few years were spent touring non-stop, world wide. Including tours with As I Lay Dying, Rise Against, Hatebreed and more.
In February 2007 they signed under High Impact Recordings a Metal Blade Records-sub label founded by As I Lay Dying vocalist Tim Lambesis. Later on July 24, their fourth album "Wolfbiker" was released. They attended Warped Tour 2008.
In 2008 the band released "Blowing Chunks" which contained two unreleased songs from the "Wolfbiker" studio sessions. It is available on 7" vinyl and digital download only.
On September 25, 2009 they released their fifth album "Almost Home", featuring guest vocals from Tim Lambesis on the track "God Rocky, Is This Your Face?". In December 2009 they went on their Almost Homeless tour together with For the Fallen Dreams and Asking Alexandria. For 2010 the band is mostly on tour. In March the band released a cover song track titled "Everlong" from the band Foo Fighters. In May they went on their 'Cheer Up Emu Kid' tour in Australia, together with Josh's side project Casey Jones and Dropsaw. In summer they were also playing with other bands like Caliban, Death Before Dishonor and As I Lay Dying on With Full Force in Germany.
In December 2010 they attended the European Persistence Tour 2010, together with Sick of it All, Casey Jones, Unearth and others.
Summer 2011 found Evergreen Terrace on tour with Bury Your Dead, For the Fallen Dreams, and several other bands.
In the fall of 2012, the band announced via their Facebook page that Josh James has left Evergreen Terrace to play full time with Stick To Your Guns, ex-bassist Jason Southwell has rejoined the band, and that they have split with Metal Blade Records. They recently signed a label deal with Rise Records.

Clementine (nuclear reactor)

Clementine was the code name for the world's first fast neutron nuclear reactor. It was an experimental scale reactor. The maximum output was 25 kW and was fueled by plutonium and cooled by liquid mercury. Clementine was located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Clementine was designed and built in 1945-46 and first achieved criticality in 1946 and full power in 1949. The reactor was named after the song "Oh My Darling, Clementine." The similarities to the song include that the reactor location was a deep canyon and the reactor operators were themselves 49'ers as 49 (last digits of element 94, isotope 239) was one of the code names for plutonium at the time.
The primary goal of Clementine was to determine nuclear properties of materials for nuclear weapons research after the Manhattan project. A number of other experiments were performed at the reactor, including investigation of the feasibility of civilian breeder reactors, and measuring neutron cross sections of various materials.
Core design.
The core was contained in a long mild steel cylinder which was inside diameter and thick. The fuel assembly was in diameter tall and contained 55 fuel elements. Each fuel element was composed of "δ"-phase plutonium-239. They were each diameter and long. The fuel elements were clad in thick plain carbon steel. The core was located at the bottom of the steel cylinder.
The core was cooled by liquid mercury. The maximum output was 25 kW of thermal energy. The mercury was circulated through the core and out to a mercury-water heat exchanger at a maximum flow rate of 0.15 L/s by an induction type electromagnetic pump which had no moving parts.
Shielding and support structure.
The reactor core was wrapped in a series of neutron reflectors and shielding structures starting with a 15 cm (6 in.) thick cylindrical blanket of natural uranium immediately surrounding the core. This blanket was open at the top and bottom and could be moved up and down. Next was a 15.2 cm (6 in.) thick steel reflector and 10 cm (4 in.) of lead. Finally most of the reactor was surrounded by multiple laminations of steel and boron plastic. This entire assembly was surrounded and supported by a thick concrete shell which provided additional shielding. A number of holes ran through the shielding to provide fast neutrons to the various physics experiments.
Reactor control.
The reactor was the first reactor to demonstrate reaction control via control of delayed neutrons, this was more of a function of being one of the very early reactors rather than a special design feature. Control was accomplished by several means. The uranium blanket described above could be raised and lowered. 238U is a good neutron reflector so the position of the blanket controlled the number of neutrons available to the reaction. When the blanket was raised more neutrons were reflected back into the core causing a greater number of fissions and consequently greater power output.
Additionally there were 2 shutdown/control rods composed of natural uranium and boron which was enriched in the boron-10 isotope. 10B is a very effective neutron poison that could be inserted to control and shut down the reaction.
Shutdown of the reactor involved simultaneously dropping the uranium blanket and inserting the two control rods into the center which absorbed neutrons and poisoned the reaction. Up to 20 other holes were available in the core for experimental configurations or additional control or fuel rods.
Use and shutdown.
Clementine operated successfully from 1946 until 1950 when the reactor was shut down to correct a problem with the control and shim rods. During this shut down it was noted that one of the natural uranium rods had ruptured. It was replaced and the reactor was restarted.
It was again operated successfully until 1952 when the cladding on one of the fuel rods ruptured. This caused contamination of the primary cooling loop with plutonium and other fission products. At this time it was decided that all the primary objectives of Clementine had been achieved and the reactor was permanently shut down and dismantled.
Results of the Clementine experiment.
The experience and data provided by operating the Clementine reactor was very useful for both military and civilian applications. One of the notable achievements of the Clementine project included measurements for the total neutron cross sections of 41 elements to a 10% accuracy. Additionally, Clementine provided invaluable experience in the control and design of fast neutron reactors. It was also determined that mercury was not an ideal cooling medium for this type of reactor due to its poor heat transfer characteristics.

<doc id="21563916" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21563916" title="Northampton and Peterborough Railway">
Northampton and Peterborough Railway

The Northampton and Peterborough Railway was an early railway promoted by the London and Birmingham Railway to run from a junction at Blisworth to Northampton and Peterborough. The Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843 and the line opened in 1845. In 1846, it became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The LNWR became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) when the railways of Great Britain were merged in the grouping of 1923. In 1948, the LMS became part of the publicly owned British Railways. Regular passenger services ceased in 1964 and the line closed completely in 1972. A part of it has since been reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line.
Origin.
Competing schemes.
There had been two original schemes for lines between London and Birmingham. One proposed by John Rennie would go via Oxford and Banbury. The other proposed by Francis Giles would go via Bletchley, Rugby and Coventry.
Amalgamation.
In 1830 the two decided to amalgamate, adopting Rennie's plan which, as a canal builder, he had laid out following fairly level country. George Stephenson was asked to plan the line and he passed it to his son Robert who carried out a further survey favouring a route very similar to that proposed by Giles, much to the annoyance of Rennie.
Northampton bypassed.
While there was a certain amount of opposition from landowners, the people of Northampton were much in favour of the line. However, in the end, it bypassed the town, following higher ground to the west, through Blisworth and Weedon. At that time it was normal for new lines to bypass the larger towns because of inherent complication and the cost of land. On the other hand, in those days, the time taken to travel to the station was not seen as a handicap, given that the total journey would be much quicker than anything that had been known before. In addition, a rail link to Weedon Barracks was seen as strategically important.
The Peterborough line.
The London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 and, four years later, a delegation from Northampton approached the directors with a proposal to build a branch which would run through to Peterborough, which at that time also had no railway although a number of schemes were being proposed.
The Bill for the line's construction met considerable opposition from those who favoured the Northern and Eastern Railway which was progressing to Cambridge and Peterborough. However the Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843.
Construction.
Once again the engineer was Robert Stephenson. The line would be relatively easy to build, following the valley of the River Nene to Peterborough, with only a small tunnel to the west of Wansford. Stations would be provided wherever the line crossed a turnpike where there would be level crossings. Most of the line was raised on embankments because of the likelihood of flooding. In spite of this it occurred from time to time. In 1852 for instance several bridges were swept away and the line was closed for a week.
Opening.
The line opened from Blisworth to Northampton in May 1845 and then throughout in June, the 47 miles having taken only a year to build. The station at Blisworth was rebuilt next to the junction, and Northampton people at last had their train service to London. In 1846 the line, along with the London and Birmingham, became part of the London and North Western Railway.
Track doubling.
Although the infrastructure of the line had been built for double track, only a single track was laid from Northampton to Peterborough, with a passing loop at Thrapston. This single line working was facilitated by the installation of electric telegraph. However it became clear that the traffic would be such that doubling would be required very quickly and this was completed by September 1846. Two stations were unusual to say the least. One, Ringstead and Addington was approached on foot from one direction by means of stepping stones. Another, Ditchford was said to be the location of famous treacle mines.
Train services.
There were five trains each way on weekdays and Saturdays, with two on Sunday, and extra services between Northampton and Blisworth. Initially the goods traffic was cattle and coal but later iron ore became important.
Connections.
In 1857 the Midland Railway built a line from Wigston to meet the GNR at Hitchin via Wellingborough. It built a spur to the LNWR station for goods. In 1861 the LNWR began running trains from Wichnor near Burton on Trent and the Midland then began running trains between Wellingborough and Northampton. The Midland built a small station in 1866 near the LNWR's (the latter becoming Northampton Bridge Street in 1876). This little station closed in 1872 when the Midland built its main line from Bedford and opened a new station at St John Street. In 1881, the LNWR opened the Northampton Loop Line which placed the town on a through service superseding Blisworth. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
Closure.
The use of level crossings had reduced the costs of building the line, but it greatly increased operating expenses and it became be a major reason for the line being closed to passengers by British Rail in 1964. Some passenger trains still ran from the boarding school at Oundle until 1972 when the line closed completely.
The Northampton and Peterborough Railway closed in 1964, followed 2 years later by the closure of Peterborough East station and the passenger services to Rugby The line between Rugby and Nassington remained open until the line was finally closed with the track remained in situ. The remaining village stations including Helpston and Ketton & Collyweston on the Syston and Peterborough Railway ceased in the same year, although line remains open with through passenger services.
Nene Valley Railway.
Part of the Northampton and Peterborough Railway has been reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line.

Arthur Letts

Arthur Letts, Sr. (June 17, 1862 – May 18, 1923) was an immigrant from England who made his name, fortune, and mark in Los Angeles, California in the early years of the 20th century. Arthur Letts built his wealth by transforming a small, bankrupt dry goods store in Downtown Los Angeles into the prominent The Broadway department store, later adding the "Bullock's" store.
Early years.
Arthur Letts, Sr. was born in England. In 1882 he emigrated to Toronto, Canada, and found employment in a large dry goods store. When the Red River Rebellion broke out in the Northwest of Canada, he volunteered. He was awarded a silver medal and clasp for distinguished service, and a grant of land by the Canadian government. In the early 1890s he emigrated to the United States in Seattle, Washington and began retail employment in dry goods.
Los Angeles.
The Broadway.
Letts arrived in the Los Angeles, California area in 1896. At the corner of Fourth and Broadway, then on the far southern edge of the downtown Los Angeles business district, the J. A. Williams & Co. Dry Goods Store had gone bankrupt. With the help of an influential friend, who was impressed with Letts’ knowledge of that type of business, a loan of $5000 was secured from the Los Angeles National Bank, and opened his business on February 24, 1896. He named the department store "The Broadway", 
Bullock's Department Store.
Arthur Letts was the 'behind the scenes' financial founder and owner of "Bullock's" department store, and put John Bullock from his "The Broadway" to direct this store. After Letts' death, Bullock and a group of investors purchased the store from the estate.
Westwood, UCLA, and Holmby Hills.
The development of Westwood, Holmby Hills, and UCLA began in 1919 when Arthur Letts, Sr purchased a portion of the Wolfskill Ranch, originally the Mexican land grant Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres. His master plan for the prime land he had purchased in western Los Angeles. was to create a mixed development of retail, apartments, residences, estates, and significant university. He personally christened the developments Westwood and "Holmby Hills," the latter loosely derived from the name of his birthplace, a small village in England called Holdenby. Arthur Letts Sr. died suddenly in 1923, before he could realize his vision.
Community.
Letts joined a number of organizations. He was member of the Hollywood Masonic Lodge, the Knights Templar, the prestigious California Club in Downtown Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the elite Los Angeles Country Club, and the Midwick Country Club in Alhambra in the San Gabriel Valley. He was also a member of the Nationally exclusive Bohemian Club on the Russian River in Sonoma County of Northern California. He was involved with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the Realty Board, the Hollywood Board of Trade, the Federation Club, and the Automobile Club of Southern California. Letts was vice-president of the Boy Scouts of America, and leader of his local troop.
Family life.
Letts married Florence Philp on August 25, 1886 in Toronto, Canada. They had three children; Florence Edna (McNaghten), Gladys (Janss), and Arthur Letts Jr. He was a skilled horticulturist and avid plant collector. The grounds of his Los Feliz district, Hollywood estate "Holmby House" were formally laid out with wide variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers, and his cactus collection was known across the country. It was bound by Franklin Avenue, Vermont Avenue, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Laughlin Park. The gardens were open to the public for tours, with the Pacific Electric Railway stopping at it. It was his wish that the gardens be continued even after his death. Upon his death in May 1923, his wife, at the suggestion of son-in-law Harold Janss of Janss Investment Company (who lived at the back of the property), demolished the gardens and mansion in 1927 to subdivide and develop the land, and moved to a new residence in Holmby Hills. She had remarried by June, 1924 to Charles Quinn. Henry E. Huntington purchased many of the rare specimen cacti for his Huntington Desert Garden at his estate and Huntington Library in San Marino
Arthur Letts, Jr..
In 1927, Arthur Letts, Jr. built a Tudor-style home at Charing Cross Road on the Los Angeles Country Club. He and Harold Janss took over the Westwood project after his father's death in 1923. His estate is now the Playboy Mansion of Hugh Hefner.
Harold Janss.
In 1911 Arthur Letts Sr.'s daughter Gladys married Harold Janss connecting the two families. The Janss Investment Company continued developing planned communities across greater Los Angeles into the 1960s.

Horace Greely Prettyman

Horace Greely Prettyman (November 8, 1857 – March 27, 1945) was an American football player in the early years of the sport. Prettyman won a record eight varsity letters at the University of Michigan, playing for the school's football team from 1882 to 1886 and 1888 to 1890. He was the team's captain in 1884, 1885, and 1886, and scored the first touchdown in the first game played at Michigan's first home football field in Ann Arbor. Prettyman later became a successful businessman and civic leader, operating a boarding house, a laundry service, a power company and the Ann Arbor Press, and holding office as an Ann Arbor city councilman, postmaster and Washtenaw County, Michigan supervisor.
Early years.
Prettyman was born in Stryker, Ohio, and raised in Bryan, Ohio. He was the son of Lewis Prettyman, a farmer, and Hannah (Kintigh) Prettyman.
1882 and 1883 football seasons.
Prettyman attended Ann Arbor High School and subsequently enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1882 at age 24 and excelled as an athlete. In addition to football, Prettyman also won competitions in the hammer throw, boxing and wrestling. In 1882, Prettyman was a "rusher" for the Michigan football team. However, the team played no intercollegiate games. 
In 1883, Michigan resumed a schedule of intercollegiate football, and Prettyman played "forward" for the team. The team played its first ever home game at the Ann Arbor Fairgrounds in March 1883, a 40-5 win over the Detroit Independents. Prettyman scored the first touchdown at the Fairgrounds at the 14-minute mark of the "first inning" and went on to score a second touchdown before the end of the inning. The team played its remaining games as part of an Eastern trip in November 1883. The trip consisted of four road games in eight days at Wesleyan and Yale in Connecticut, Harvard in Massachusetts, and Stevens Institute in Hoboken, New Jersey. The trip cost $3,000 and was arranged "to both represent and advertise the college among the Eastern cities and universities." Prettyman was placed in charge of the trip, and "The Michigan Argonaut" praised his management: "All the boys are most hearty in their commendation of Prettyman's excellent management of the financial interests of the trip and his success is seen by the fact that every expense of the trip has been paid to the last cent."
On the trip, the team lost to Yale 46–0, the worst defeat to that time in the history of Michigan football. The Yale game was played on a Saturday, and Michigan played Harvard the next day, losing 3–0. The second half was played largely in darkness, and the "Boston Journal" said of the play:"All that could really be called a game was the first half before the intermission, the latter half being nothing more than a scramble because of the darkness. ... he pitch dark for the whole of this half prevented the teams from distinguishing friend from foe. It was one continuous scramble, and the spectators were unable to distinguish any of the actions."
Late in the game, Michigan appeared to have scored the winning touchdown on a trick play, called "the time-honored fake run." Prettyman began running with teammate (and future Boston Red Sox owner) Henry Killilea behind him. Just before being tackled, Prettyman passed the ball to Killilea, who ran for the touchdown while Prettyman ran "head-on into the Harvard full-back." The Harvard umpire called the ball was "down" where Prettyman had been tackled, and the referee ordered it back to the midfield and called the game on account of darkness. Some claimed that the Harvard umpire had not seen the play due to the darkness, and had called Prettyman down at the urging of a Harvard player. The Michigan team arranged to stay and play another game the next day. However, according to a 1920 history of the University of Michigan, Harvard refused and instead "pleaded faculty interference and paid a $100 forfeit."
After the final game of the Eastern trip against Stevens Institute, "The New York Times" noted that Killilea and Prettyman "did some of the best work for the Michigan men in the way of running and tackling."
1884 and 1885 football seasons.
In 1884, Prettyman was chosen as captain of the football team. The team won both of its intercollegiate games, including an 18 to 10 win in its first match against its eventual rival, the University of Chicago. The team beat Albion College 18 to 0 in its other game in 1884. Prettyman received his Bachelor's degree in 1885, but stayed on at the university as a graduate student from 1885 to 1886. In 1885, Prettyman was again selected as captain and led the football team to its second consecutive undefeated season. The 1885 team did not allow its opponents to score a single point, outscoring them 82 to 0.
1886 football season.
In 1886, Prettyman was selected as captain of the football team for the third straight year. No player before or since has been selected as captain of the Michigan football team more than twice. The 1886 team played two games, both against Albion College. Michigan won the first game at Albion by a score of 50 to 0. "The Michigan Argonaut" credited Prettyman for his fine play in the game. The second game was played at the Ann Arbor Fairgrounds as part of a "field day" that included various athletic events. Michigan won the football game 24 to 0, and the "Argonaut" reported that "Prettyman's play was characterized by his usual heavy rushing."
In Prettyman's three years as captain, Michigan never lost a game, winning seven games and losing none over the three-year span, and outscoring opponents 192 to 10.
1888 to 1890 football seasons.
Prettyman worked as a traveling salesman from 1886 to 1887, general manager of Bulles & Co. (an Ann Arbor manufacturer of gelatin capsules) in 1888, and a real estate agent and hotel manager starting in 1889. Though he was no longer a student, college football eligibility standards were loose, and Prettyman returned to play three more years for Michigan, as the team's center in 1888, and as a tackle in 1889 and 1890. 
In 1888, the team was undefeated, having beaten Notre Dame twice, going into the final game of the year against the University of Chicago. Michigan lost the game 26–4 in front of a crowd of 2,500 persons, and Prettyman was "disqualified for striking one of the U.C. team." The 1889 rematch against Chicago was played on icy grass and mud-colored snow with a 40-mile-an-hour wind. Prettyman was again involved in a fight that resulted in his expulsion from the game. One Chicago newspaper described the incident this way:"In the main, the players kept their tempers very well during the excitement of the struggle but while the second half was in, Prettyman, the big rusher of the Michigan team who was mixed up in a fracas during the game of last year, forgot himself and slugged one of the Chicago men vigorously. This came near bringing on a fight and the crowd broke into the field and surrounded the players closely while the occupants of the grand stand hissed the unexpected display. The cooler players, however, quickly brought the others to their senses, and the tempest was soon over. The police cleared the field and play was resumed, but not until Prettyman had been ruled off and Hull substituted for him."
In 1890, Prettyman played as part of the first racially integrated football team at Michigan, alongside African-American teammate George Jewett.
Later years.
Prettyman married Jennie McNames in June 1887, and the two operated a boarding house at 602 Lawrence Street in Ann Arbor that was known as the Campus Club, and also Prettyman's Boarding House. Mr. and Mrs. Prettyman charged $1.50 per week for a room and $2.50 per week for board. Prettyman was a member of the Ann Arbor City Council from 1891 to 1895, president of the Ann Arbor Municipal League from 1892 to 1894, and a Washtenaw County supervisor starting in 1901. Prettyman sold his boarding house to the University in 1914 and later became the principal owner and president of the Ann Arbor Press and the president of the White Swan Laundry and the Wolverine Power Company. He was also Ann Arbor's postmaster for a time starting in 1906. Prettyman died in March 1945 at age 87.

<doc id="21563962" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21563962" title="Flat Belly Diet">
Flat Belly Diet

Flat Belly Diet (or Flat Belly Diet!) is a diet book by Liz Vaccariello (vice-president and editor-in-chief of Prevention) and Cynthia Sass (Prevention's nutrition director). The book was first published Rodale Books in October 2008.
Overview.
The book contains a 32-day diet plan that the authors claim can help dieters lose 15 pounds in that time, as well as several inches of belly fat, the body fat many experts now claim is particularly unhealthy fat, especially for women. In only 96 hours a dieter can lose 7 pounds and over 5 inches. All of this, according to the book and the advertisements, can be achieved without exercise or without giving up favorite foods.
Though the book has spent 21 weeks on "The New York Times" Bestseller List in the Hardcover Advice section, many are critical of the diet, though most critics find fault with the claims made by the book about how it targets belly fat rather than the diet itself. Fans of the diet cite things like the ability to eat certain foods prohibited on other diet like nuts and chocolate, as well as the emphasis on whole, natural foods over things like pre-packaged diet foods and artificial ingredients.
Diet Principles.
The Flat Belly Diet begins with a 4-day jump start, known as the Anti-Bloat Jumpstart. The first 4 days are the most restrictive of the diet. The book gives a very specific menu for those 4 days with the focus on foods the authors claim will immediately relieve “belly bloat” and prepare the dieter to embark on the regular diet starting on day 5.
One of the major components of the 4-day anti-bloat jump start is "Sassy Water," named for Cynthia Sass. This water which contains things like cucumber, ginger and other natural ingredients is supposed to aid the dieter in getting a good water intake as well as providing nutrients.
After the 4-day anti-bloat part, the dieter begins the real diet which stresses a MUFA at every meal. MUFAs are mono-unsaturated fats like those found in some oils like olive oil, some chocolate like semi-sweet chocolate, some nuts and seeds, olives and avocados. The authors claim that it’s this regular ingestion of MUFAs that helps target belly fat and is credited with helping the dieter feel more full and satisfied after each meal.
Other key principles of the diet include eating 4 meals a day, instead of three, with the daily calories of about 1600 spread evenly between the 4 meals, for 400-calorie meals. While 1600-calories a day is a standard amount many weight loss diets aim for, the Flat Belly Diet encourages things most other diet don’t, like including chocolate in your meal plans to benefit from the MUFAs contained in the chocolate as well as keeping the dieter from becoming discouraged at the idea of not being able to enjoy favorite foods like chocolate (and peanut butter, another high-calorie but MUFA-rich food that’s allowed on the Flat Belly Diet! and typically left out of other weight loss diets).
Sales.
As of April 26, 2009, the Flat Belly Diet! had spent 21 weeks on "The New York Times" Bestseller List under hardcover advice books. As of September 20, 2009, the companion book, "The Flat Belly Diet! Cookbook", had spent 3 weeks on the "New York Times" Bestseller List under hardcover advice books.

Kenelm Hubert Digby

Kenelm Hubert Digby MBE (10 March 1912, London – 5 August 2001) was the proposer of the notorious 1933 "King and Country" debate in the Oxford Union, and later Attorney General and judge in Sarawak.
Biography.
Digby was born in London, the son of Edward Aylmer Digby and Winifred Digby Watson, who were first cousins. Digby's paternal grandfather was Sir Kenelm Edward Digby, a lawyer who was Permanent Under-Secretary in the British Home Office from 1895 to 1903; his father was also a lawyer, who had commanded a warship in the Great War and had stood unsuccessfully for parliament as both a Liberal and a Labour candidate. Kenelm Digby was educated at Lydgate House Preparatory School and then Gresham's School in Norfolk, and then studied philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at St John's College, Oxford.
In 1933 at a debate in the Oxford Union, Digby proposed the motion "That this House would in no circumstances fight for its King and country." The debate was lively, and eventually was carried by 275 votes to 153. A nationwide furore followed, and Digby and his fellow undergraduates were accused of sending a dangerous message to Europe's dictators — that English were soft and would not fight. "Isis", a student magazine of the University of Oxford, reported that Digby had a "tub-thumping style of oratory which would be more appreciated in Hyde Park than in the Union", while sixty years after the event Digby mused "It was just a debate. I don't know what all the fuss was about. Frank Hardie had asked me to propose the motion and I agreed. That's all there was to it. But ever since the debate security intelligence organisations seem to have taken an interest in me." Digby kept the white feathers he was given after the debate.
In 1934 he was called to the Bar and a few days later sailed to Kuching in Sarawak as a newly recruited District Officer to work for Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke, last of the White Rajahs of Sarawak. He returned to England at the end of his contract in 1939 and went into chambers as a pupil of Neil Lawson, who subsequently became a High Court Judge. On the outbreak of war, he joined the National Council for Civil Liberties as an unpaid volunteer while awaiting his call-up, having no intention of registering as a conscientious objector. In the spring of 1940 he was asked back to Sarawak, and was appointed Legal Adviser to Rajah Brooke and a member of the Council Negri. He played an important role in drafting Sarawak's 1941 constitution. With the Japanese invasion of Borneo, Sarawak was taken over by the Japanese in December 1941, and the Europeans interned, first in houses and prisons in Kuching and then at the Batu Lintang camp outside Kuching. Digby spent three and a half years here, until his liberation in September 1945.
Digby met his wife-to-be Mutal Fielding on a P&O liner on the way back to Kuching in 1940, and they became engaged in Singapore in 1941. Mutal lived in Hong Kong, and before they could be married the war intervened. Mutal was interned at Stanley Internment Camp, and amongst the many internees there was Kenelm's cousin Professor Kenelm Hutchinson Digby, who was a leading surgeon and head of surgery at Hong Kong University. Digby and Mutal were finally reunited in November 1945 in Southampton, when Digby arrived home on HMS "Ranchi". The Digbys were married on 21 February 1946 at Sherfield English near Romsey in Hampshire, before returning to Sarawak. Digby rejoined the Sarawak Civil Service as Legal Adviser, then becoming Attorney-General and editor of the "Sarawak Gazette" and a circuit judge.
Digby's circuit judge's job ended in 1951, and he returned to London and practised briefly at the bar. He also found alternative work as a deputy coroner to five London boroughs. He left with Mutal for New Zealand in 1955, tempted by New Zealand's assisted migration scheme. He worked as a solicitor for the State Advances Corporation in Wellington for five years, and then was appointed solicitor to the Department of Health. He retired in 1977 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was also a Companion of the Star of Sarawak. He died on 5 August 2001 after a fall in his garden, and was survived by Mutal and their three children.
For Digby, the fall-out from the Oxford debate of 1933 lasted through many decades. A lifelong socialist but never a communist, Digby's suspected communism made him unpopular with the authorities in Sarawak and brought his career there to a premature end, and he was rarely briefed by solicitors when working as a lawyer in the UK. After his death, Mutal commented: "That Oxford Union motion haunted him. It dogged him wherever he went."

Bandhan Saat Janamon Ka

Bandhan Saat Janamon Ka is an Indian television series which premiered on Colors on July 21, 2008. The story is of an intelligent, mature, simple girl who gets married to be caught up dowry worries. First of all, she completes her dream marriage between her and Parth, when the Gupta family confront the Agarwal family about arranging 2.5 million for the release of their son Parth who was allegedly in prison. Unfortunately, in greed of money the Gupta family consistently started to harass Trilok Agarwal (Janvi's father), to arrange for the 2.5 million. Their demand began to begin a burden for Janvi's father, and he tried to sell Manohar's side of his house for rent, (which he agreed for), but Shobhna (Janvi's Aunt), refused her side of the house to be sold. This made Janvi's father suffer even more, and becoming more prone to asthma attacks, had finally found the truth about the Gupta family, that they were money-hungry, and would maltreat Janvi to make Janvi's father pay up his debt as quick as possible.Whilst this was taking place, Janvi was locked in the dark storeroom to wake up early in the morning to do morning chores. She was constantly harassed in her room, with people trying to scare her. Finally at his limit, he died of an asthma attack after Shobhna had gone over a daily row over spending and doling out costs.
Janvi's father had his funeral and Janvi was given excuses that she could'tn attend the funeral. Nikita gave her false hopes and said she would take her to the hospital to meet her father, when he had already met his demise. Janvi went to the temple to offer flowers to Mata Durga's idol while Nikita stood beside her, putting on an evil smile on her face. After that, Janvi noticed her father's corpse wrapped up in the white cloth and immediately recognised her family surrounding the corpse. She rushed over, with Nikita persistently trying to push her back, and then she drove off in the car,leaving Janvi alone to see her father.

Love You Down

"Love You Down" is the title of an R&B song written by Melvin Riley Jr. Riley's former band, Ready for the World, originally recorded the song in 1986 and released it as the lead single from their second album, "Long Time Coming" produced by Gary Spaniola. A slow jam, "Love You Down" was a hit on the "Billboard" pop and R&B charts, spending two weeks atop the R&B chart in December 1986 and peaking at #9 on the pop chart in early 1987. This was Ready for the World's second R&B chart-topper, following the success of "Oh Sheila" in 1985. It also reached #24 on the "Billboard" adult contemporary chart. The song charted in the United Kingdom at #60 on the UK Singles Chart. The song has been covered by artists such as R&B singer INOJ and neo soul musician Me'shell Ndegeocello.
INOJ version.
Female R&B vocalist INOJ recorded a cover version of "Love You Down" in 1997 with the assistance of producer Charles "The Mixologist" Roane. Featuring a faster beat and more percussion than the original version, INOJ's cover was initially featured on So So Def Recordings' "So So Def Bass All-Stars Vol. 2" compilation album. Shortly after the compilation's release in late June 1997, the song began amassing airplay, entering "Billboard"'s Hot 100 Airplay chart on the issue dated August 2, 1997; it would go on to spend 45 weeks on that chart, becoming especially popular on rhythmic radio. A music video, directed by Eric Haywood and Rubin Whitmore in Atlanta, premiered in August. A physical single, also containing Lathun's "Freak It" from the same So So Def compilation, was later released in January 1998, making the song eligible for the Hot 100. The song ultimately reached #25 on that chart. "Love You Down" was later included on INOJ's debut album, incidentally titled "Ready for the World", released by So So Def/Columbia in summer 1999.

Solska Wilderness

Solska Wilderness () is a large forest complex in southern part of the Lublin Voivodeship, about 100 km south of Lublin, Poland. It occupies an area north of the San and south of the Roztocze Upland. The forest is mostly made of coniferous trees, part of them having been artificially planted. Its total area is 124 000, which makes it the second biggest forest complex of Poland (after the Lower Silesian Wilderness). Until late Middle Ages, the Solska Wilderness was connected with another huge complex, the Sandomierz Wilderness, but deforestation separated these two complexes from each other.
Solska Wilderness is rich in landscape parks (such as the Puszcza Solska Landscape Park), nature reserves and peat bogs. Main rivers that cross the area are the Tanew, and the Lada and main cities are Bilgoraj, Tomaszow Lubelski and Jozefow. The forest is crossed by several routes, including the main national road number 17, which goes from Warsaw, via Lublin, to Lviv. Also, a Zwierzyniec - Belzec rail line goes through it.

Bozner Bergsteigerlied

The Bozner Bergsteigerlied () is one of the two unofficial hymns of the South Tyroleans, the other being the "Andreas-Hofer-Lied". Its lyrics were composed in 1926 by Karl Felderer in Moos am Ritten to the melody of an old Tyrolean craftsmen's song. 
At the time of its composition, the Italianization of South Tyrol campaign of the Italian fascists had reached its height, effecting a prohibition of all names related to "Südtirol" and "Deutsch-Südtirol". Therefore, the lyrics never mention South Tyrol directly, referring instead to its geographical extension. 
In the first verse, its north-south extension is described by the way of the Eisack source and the "Salurner Klause", a bottleneck which used to mark the border between the German and Italian-speaking area. The West-East extension is characterized by the mountain Ortler and the Sexten Dolomites. In the following verses, various landmarks of South Tyrol such as the Schlern and the Rosengarten group are celebrated.

The Chief of the Military Staff of the President of the Republic ("Chef d'état-major particulier du président de la République") is a role in the military and government of France, heading the president's military staff until the French Fifth Republic.
Heads of the president's military household (1879-1940).
The President's 'military household' ("maison militaire") was formed by president Mac-Mahon but not insititutionalised until 1880. This group of officers advised the president on army matters, especially (under the French Third Republic) matters of ceremony. Such an allocation was useful since it allowed its officers to nourish political contacts in Paris who could aid their army careers. 
President's chief of staff.
The 'chef d’état-major particulier' (CEMP) was the main military collaborator to the chief of staff, who headed the military overall, acting as an interface with him and playing a vital role in putting into practice nuclear deterrence.

Journal for Plague Lovers

Journal for Plague Lovers is the ninth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 18 May 2009, through record label Columbia, and features posthumous lyrics by Richey Edwards, who vanished on 1 February 1995, and was presumed deceased in 2008. It is the only Manic Street Preachers album in which the lyrics for every song were written solely by Edwards. The album cover is an original painting by Jenny Saville, who also contributed artwork for "The Holy Bible".
Background.
The Manics posted the following message on their official website:
All thirteen songs on the new record feature lyrics left to us by Richey. The brilliance and intelligence of the lyrics dictated that we had to finally use them. Topics include "The Grande Odalisque" by Ingres, Marlon Brando, Giant Haystacks, celebrity, consumerism and dysmorphia; all reiterating the genius and intellect of Richard James Edwards.
Wire, the band's de facto lyricist, had begun contributing musically to the songwriting process on the album, stating "I did write quite a bit of music. [...] I wrote all of 'William's Last Words', I wrote pretty much all of 'Marlon JD', I wrote the chorus for 'Peeled Apples', the verse for 'She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach'". The lyrics are taken from a folder of songs, haikus, collages and drawings Edwards gave to bassist-lyricist Nicky Wire a few weeks before he disappeared. Edwards also gave photocopies of the folder to singer-guitarist James Dean Bradfield and drummer Sean Moore. The band have described the Rymans folder as having a picture of Bugs Bunny drawn on the front emblazoned with the word 'opulence' in capital letters. In promotional interviews for the album, Bradfield and Wire have revealed that the folder contains around twenty-eight songs. Four of these appeared on the 1996 album "Everything Must Go": "Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier", "Kevin Carter", "Removables" and "Small Black Flowers that Grow in the Sky". Of the rest of the folder, Wire stated:
There's probably between eight and ten maybe that were too impossible. Some of them are little haikus, four lines. "Dolphin-Friendly Tuna Wars", that's one; "Alien Orders/Invisible Armies", that's one band have recorded an instrumental that takes its title from this lyric; "Young Men", which is quite Joy Division. They just didn't feel right. We'll probably put them all out in a book one day. There's not gonna be a "Journal for Plague Lovers Two". The special version of the record does come with the original version of the tracks on there. So you can see the editing process, if there is any.
Several tracks refer to Edwards' time in a couple of hospitals in 1994. Among them is "She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach", of which James Dean Bradfield said to the "NME": "There're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I think he just digested other people's stories and experiences." The final track, "William's Last Words", has been compared to a suicide note, and although Nicky Wire rejects this suggestion, Bradfield observes, "you can draw some pretty obvious conclusions from the lyrics." Wire, who admitted finding the task of editing this song "pretty choking", eventually composed the music and sang lead vocals after Bradfield found himself unsuited to the task. The album features several cultural references, including a passage from the film "The Machinist", which features in the song "Peeled Apples" and a passage taken from the film "The Virgin Suicides", which features in the song "Doors Closing Slowly".
Bradfield commented that "Journal for Plague Lovers" was an attempt to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the recording process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it as close to him being in the room again as possible."
Release.
The album was released on CD, a two-disc CD edition, download and LP. The deluxe CD edition includes a second disc with demo versions of all thirteen album songs and a hardback 36-page booklet featuring Edwards' original lyrics and artwork. This version of the album is missing the hidden track "Bag Lady". The Japanese edition of the album was released on 13 May 2009, and features two exclusive bonus tracks. The download version includes a bonus remix by the NYPC and an acoustic version of the title track.
The album's opening track, "Peeled Apples", was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 25 March 2009. During an interview with Lowe, Wire said there would be no singles released from the album. "Jackie Collins Existential Question Time" was aired on XFM and "Kerrang!" Radio on 30 March. It was also embedded on the band's official website.
Album cover controversy.
The top four UK supermarkets stocked the CD in a plain slipcase, as the cover was deemed "inappropriate". Bradfield regards the decision as "utterly bizarre", and has commented: "You can have lovely shiny buttocks and guns everywhere in the supermarket on covers of magazines and CDs, but you show a piece of art and people just freak out."
Remixes EP.
Tracks from "Journal for Plague Lovers" have been remixed by a number of artists, and the "Remixes EP" was released on 15 June 2009. Martin Noble of the band British Sea Power has remixed the song "Me and Stephen Hawking". Andrew Weatherall has produced a remix of "Peeled Apples", which he has described as "sounding like Charlie Watts playing with PiL". The Horrors have remixed "Doors Closing Slowly". NYPC have remixed the song "Marlon J.D". The EP also features remixes by Patrick Wolf, Underworld, Four Tet, Errors, Adem, Optimo and Fuck Buttons.
Critical reception.
Contrary to worries on the part of Nicky Wire that "Journal for Plague Lovers" "could seriously damage" the band, and in spite of initial suspicions that the album constituted "a blatant attempt to recapture the glory days of an album released 15 years ago", reviews were ultimately highly favourable. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 85 out of 100 based on eighteen reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim"; it was also received well by fans, achieving an average user score of 9.2 out of 10.
"Journal for Plague Lovers" scored a rare five-star review in "Q" magazine, which argued that by "breathing life into Richey Edwards's own last words", the band "crafted not a memorial but a celebration". Retrospectively, the publication named the album the fifth best record of 2009, declaring it one of the band's "finest and most heartfelt moments". John Doran from "NME" awarded the record eight out of ten, arguing that "Journal for Plague Lovers" should not be burdened with expectations of becoming ""The Holy Bible" Mark II" but was simply "an outstanding album in its own right". The magazine named the album the fourteenth best of the year. "Uncut", meanwhile, argued that the record brought a "sense of closure" to the legacy of Richey Edwards, describing it as a "brave, compelling record that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Manics' best", and the twenty-third best album of 2009.
Response from news publications was mostly positive, with Caroline Sullivan of "The Guardian" awarding the album, described as "a passionate rock album that honours the past yet is very much of the present", four stars out of five, and Simon Price of "The Independent" declared "Journal for Plague Lovers" "the album of 2009 – hands down, no contest". David Cheal of "The Daily Telegraph" was critical, however, accusing them of being "a plodding indie-rock trio whose ambition has consistently outstripped their ability" and giving the record only two stars out of five. Elsewhere, "Journal for Plague Lovers" earned recognition as a return to form begun on previous album "Send Away the Tigers"; for example, from Pitchfork's Joe Tangari, who summarized the album thus: "Even if it were the desperate or cynical move some people have claimed it is, there's no denying that purging Edwards' old lyric folder has helped the band create its best album in a decade. Quite simply, they haven't sounded so focused or so purposeful in a long, long time, and they are at their best with a sense of purpose underpinning their music." Likewise, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic remarked that "they were making inroads in this direction on 2007's "Send Away the Tigers" – for tight, clanking, cantankerous guitars" and commended the album for its sense of hope: ""Journal for Plague Lovers" winds up being The Holy Bible in reverse: every moment of despair is a reason to keep on living instead of an excuse to pack it all in."
Accolades.
"Journal for Plague Lovers" was placed at number 10 on Metacritic's list of the fifty best-reviewed albums of 2009, and was placed on numerous critic's ranking lists for the year, particularly from British music magazines:

He is an editor at the popular Beijing News daily and his book Fanciful Animals (想象中的动物) was published last November 2008. He is also known for his blog "Pro-State in Flames", published on bullog.cn. The blog name "Pro-State in Flames" (钱烈宪要发言) literally means "Qian Liexian Wants to Speak" but sounds like prostate wants to be inflamed.
Qian Liexian was described as "20 Most Influential Figures in China's Cyberspace" by "Southern Metropolis Weekly". He was also a nominee for the best Chinese blog in the 2005 BoB award organized by Deutsche Welle.
Stabbing incident.
On Feb 14, 2009, Qian was speaking at the One Way Street bookshop in Beijing. He was answering questions when a fight erupted. His wife said two men forced him into the men's bathroom. She chased after them and found that one was holding a vegetable knife and the other a dagger. The men escaped, leaving Qian on the ground with a cut to his stomach. The two men attempted to cut Qian's hand before fleeing. Xiao Sanlang, who edits Qian's articles at Beijing News Daily, said the men had announced they were taking revenge. Qian was hospitalized after the incident.
The bold assault stirred fears and a flurry of rumors. Some people suggested the attack may have stemmed from Qian’s writings, many of which take swipes at government corruption or poke fun at the ruling Communist Party of China. In recent weeks, Qian’s blog has included items on censorship, the melamine milk scandal and the Beijing Television Cultural Center fire.

<doc id="21564201" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21564201" title="Adversus Judaeos">
Adversus Judaeos

Adversus Judaeos (Greek "kata Ioudaious", "against the Jews" or "against the Judeans") are a series of fourth century homilies by John Chrysostom that have been circulated by many groups to foster antisemitism. Steven Katz cites Chrysostom's homilies as “the decisive turn in the history of Christian anti-Judaism, a turn whose ultimate disfiguring consequence was enacted in the political antisemitism of Adolf Hitler”. James Parkes called the writing on Jews "the most horrible and violent denunciations of Judaism to be found in the writings of a Christian theologian". His sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.
Purpose and context.
During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386-387), Chrysostom denounced Jews and Judaizing Christians in a series of eight sermons delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances. It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general. His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, utilizing the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the "psogos" (Greek: blame).
One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom's flock. In his sermons, Chrysostom criticized those "Judaizing Christians", who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as observing the sabbath, submitting to circumcision and pilgrimage to Jewish holy places.
In Greek, the sermons are called "Kata Ioudaiōn" ("Κατά Ιουδαίων"), which is translated as "Adversus Judaeos" in Latin and "Against the Jews" in English. The most recent scholarly translations, claiming that Chrysostom's primary targets were members of his own congregation who continued to observe the Jewish feasts and fasts, give the sermons the more sympathetic title "Against Judaizing Christians".
Controversial claims.
Chrysostom claimed that on the shabbats and Jewish festivals synagogues were full of Christians, especially women, who loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy, enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom. A more recent apologetic theory is that he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians, who for centuries had kept connections with Jews and Judaism, to choose between Judaism and Christianity.
Chrysostom held Jews responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and deicide (killing God, see "Jewish deicide" for the subject) and added that they continued to rejoice in Jesus's death. He compared the synagogue to a pagan temple, representing it as the source of all vices and heresies.
He described it as a place worse than a brothel and a drinking shop; it was a den of scoundrels, the repair of wild beasts, a temple of demons, the refuge of brigands and debauchees, and the cavern of devils, a criminal assembly of the assassins of Christ. Palladius, Chrysostom's contemporary biographer, also recorded his claim that among the Jews the priesthood may be purchased and sold for money. Finally, he declared that, in accordance with the sentiments of the saints, he hated both the synagogue and the Jews., saying that "demons dwell in the synagogue" and "also in the souls of the Jews", and describing them as growing "fit for slaughter"
Historical recuperation.
The original Benedictine editor of the homilies, Bernard de Montfaucon, gives the following footnote to the title: "A discourse against the Jews; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them Jews." As such, some have claimed that the original title misrepresents the contents of the discourses, which show that Chrysostom's primary targets were members of his own congregation who continued to observe the Jewish feasts and fasts. Sir Henry Savile, in his 1612 edition of "Homilies" 27 of Volume 6 (which is "Discourse I" in Patrologia Graeca's "Adversus Iudaeos"), gives the title: "Chrysostom's Discourse Against Those Who Are Judaizing and Observing Their Fasts."
British historian Paul Johnson claimed that Chrysostom's homilies "became the pattern for anti-Jewish tirades, making the fullest possible use (and misuse) of key passages in the gospels of Saints Matthew and John. Thus a specifically Christian anti-Semitism, presenting the Jews as murderers of Christ, was grafted on to the seething mass of pagan smears and rumours, and Jewish communities were now at risk in every Christian city." During World War II, the Nazi Party in Germany abused his work in an attempt to legitimize the Holocaust in the eyes of German and Austrian Christians. His works were frequently quoted and reprinted as a witness for the prosecution.
After World War II, the Christian Churches denounced Nazi use of Chrysostom's works, explaining his words with reference to the historical context. According to Walter Laqueur, it was argued that in the 4th century, the general discourse was brutal and aggressive and that at the time when the Christian church was fighting for survival and recognition, mercy and forgiveness were not in demand.
According to Patristics scholars, opposition to any particular view during the late fourth century was conventionally expressed in a manner, utilizing the rhetorical form known as the "psogos", whose literary conventions were to vilify opponents in an uncompromising manner; thus, it has been argued that to call Chrysostom an "anti-Semite" is to employ anachronistic terminology in a way incongruous with historical context and record.
Other Adversus Iudaeos literature.
Other documents also form part of the adversus judaeos literature. These include Tertullian or Pseudo-Tertullian's own Adversus Iudaeos, Pseudo-Gregory of Nyssa's testimonies against the Jews, the Adversus Iudaeos texts in the literature of medieval Russia, Schreckenberg sees in the popular anti-semitic references, such as anti-ursurer poetry by the Rhineland poet Muskatblut an extension of Adversus-Judaeos-Texte. even Eusebius' Demonstratio against paganism.
Samuel Krauss, Jean Juster and later Marcel Simon argued that the adversus iudaeos literature is a form of continuation of earlier Jewish-Christian encounters, specifically until the reign of Julian in 361, though other writers see the documents as more about strengthening Christian self-identity.

Linear model of innovation

The Linear Model of Innovation is an early model of innovation that suggests technical change happens in a linear fashion from Invention to Innovation to Diffusion.
It prioritises scientific research as the basis of innovation, and plays down the role of later players in the innovation process.
Current models of innovation deriving from approaches such as Actor-Network Theory or Social shaping of technology provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works.
Current ideas in Open Innovation and User innovation derive from these later ideas.
Also known as ‘Traditional Phase Gate Model’, under this model, product or services concept is frozen at early stage so as to minimize risk. Also innovation process in enterprise involves series of sequential phases/steps arranged in such a manner that the preceding phase must be cleared before moving to next phase. Thus a project must pass through a gate with the permission of gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase.
Criteria for passing through each gate, and the person at each gate are defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place at the preceding phase or not?
Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented:
From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace, Rothwell (1994) The stages of the "Technology Push" model are:
From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the "market pull" model of innovation. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing R&D, which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the "market pull " model are:
The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different "stages" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation. A history of the linear model of innovation may be found in Godin (2006)

Leadership Institute at Harvard College

The Leadership Institute at Harvard College (LIHC) is the largest student-run leadership training and development organization at Harvard College, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 2005, the Leadership Institute hosts high-profile speakers, organizes skill development workshops and forums, and publishes the annual Harvard Undergraduate Leadership Magazine. LIHC is the umbrella organization for four integrated programs: the Leadership Development Initiative (LDI), the Presidents' Forum (TPF), the Harvard Undergraduate Leadership Magazine (HULM) and the LIHC-Citizen Schools Youth Outreach Initiative.
History and Structure.
Founded in 2005 by four Harvard undergraduates, LIHC was established in response to the lack of leadership development resources available to Harvard College students. More recently, in September 2008, LIHC announced its definition of leadership: "the skill of motivating, guiding and empowering a team towards a socially responsible vision." The Leadership Institute is guided by an Executive Board of eight undergraduates and a Board of Advisors drawn from Harvard Business School, the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School, as well as government and corporate institutions. Members of the 2011 Executive Board are: 
Members of the Board of Advisors (as of September 2011) are: 
Leadership Development Initiative.
The Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) hosts skill-building workshops (the Skills Development Series) and speaker events with veteran leaders (Biography Speaker Series) to connect undergraduates with exemplary role models. Speakers are drawn from all sectors, including business, civil service, non-profit, social entrepreneurship and healthcare. LIHC conducts surveys to determine the specific leadership training needs at Harvard College, and tailors its workshops to satisfy these needs, such as ethical decision-making in difficult situations, public speaking, negotiation and persuasion, leadership in entrepreneurship, dealing with organizational change, and facing competition with integrity.
In the past, LDI has hosted:
• Ray Mabus, United States Secretary of the Navy and former Mississippi Governor
• John Clarkeson, former CEO and Chairman of Boston Consulting Group
• Tom Monahan, CEO and Chairman of The Corporate Executive Board Company
• David Gergen, Director of the Center for Public Leadership and adviser to presidents for over 30 years
• Bill Drayton, CEO and Founder of Ashoka
• Lewis B. Kaden, Vice Chairman of Citigroup<br>
• Seth Moulton, Marine Corps veteran in Iraq, Special Assistant to General Petraeus<br>
• Rye Barcott, Founder and President of international NGO Carolina for Kibera<br>
• Tad Hutcheson, Vice President of Marketing of AirTran Airways<br>
• Fred Swaniker, Co-Founder and CEO of the African Leadership Academy<br>
• Alan Khazei, Co-Founder and former CEO of City Year<br>
• Jim Mongan, President and CEO of Partners HealthCare, former President of the Massachusetts General Hospital
LDI has also hosted workshops on Public Speaking, Sales, Negotiations, Managing Organizational Transitions, Building an Effective Team Culture, Effective Delegation, Organizational Sustainability and Growth, Elevator Pitches, and Using Your Emotions as you Negotiate.
The Presidents' Forum.
The Presidents' Forum (TPF) brings together the Presidents, Managing Editors and Captains of Harvard's student organizations and Varsity sports teams in bi-monthly discussion forums and an annual banquet (the President's Banquet). The Presidents' Banquet is the largest gathering of student leaders at Harvard College, and enables student leaders to learn from each other's experiences and establish lifelong friendships and correspondences. Past keynote speakers of the Banquet include:
• Carl Hobert, Founder and Executive Director of Axis of Hope Center for Conflict Resolution and Prevention<br>
• Bill George, HBS Professor of Management Practice, author of True North, and former CEO of Medtronic, Inc.<br>
• Abigail Levy, McKinsey innovations expert
Harvard Undergraduate Leadership Magazine.
The annual Harvard Undergraduate Leadership Magazine (HULM) was inaugurated in 2008 with the intention of empowering students to examine leadership through multiple perspectives and to construct their own conceptions of what it means to be a true leader. The full-color publication features articles on leadership skills as well as interviews and biographies. The magazine has a circulation of 1000. Featured leaders include:
Social Outreach.
In 2009, LIHC began an experimental youth outreach program, targeting at-risk middle school students in the Boston area. This program, a partnership with the nationally renowned Citizen Schools program, aims to provide pertinent leadership skills for youth. The program has now expanded to 3 schools and hopes to expand in the future.
Special Initiatives.
LIHC spearheads a number of special initiatives to expand its impact at and beyond Harvard.
In August 2011, LIHC held the YOUth Lead the Change summer camp for high school students.
In January 2011, LIHC helped lead the Freshman Leadership Initiative. 
Additionally, the Leadership Institute in July 2009 announced they had received a grant from the Flora Family Foundation to promote leadership resources both at Harvard University and the broader community. 
Partnership with the Ivy Council
The Leadership Institute works with the Ivy Council to facilitate a coordinated response to the leadership challenges faced by all eight Ivy League schools.
Ivy Leadership Summit XII
In the 2011-2012 school year, LIHC and the Ivy Council will host the Ivy Leadership Summit which brings together student leaders from all eight Ivy League schools.

Bcrypt

bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords designed by Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.
Blowfish is notable among block ciphers for its expensive key setup phase. It starts off with subkeys in a standard state, then uses this state to perform a block encryption using part of the key, and uses the result of that encryption (which is more accurately a hashing) to replace some of the subkeys. Then it uses this modified state to encrypt another part of the key, and uses the result to replace more of the subkeys. It proceeds in this fashion, using a progressively modified state to hash the key and replace bits of state, until all subkeys have been set.
Provos and Mazières took advantage of this, and took it further. They developed a new key setup algorithm for Blowfish, dubbing the resulting cipher "Eksblowfish" ("expensive key schedule Blowfish"). The key setup begins with a modified form of the standard Blowfish key setup, in which both the salt and password are used to set all subkeys. There are then a number of rounds in which the standard Blowfish keying algorithm is applied, using alternately the salt and the password as the key, each round starting with the subkey state from the previous round. Cryptotheoretically, this is no stronger than the standard Blowfish key schedule, but the number of rekeying rounds is configurable; this process can therefore be made arbitrarily slow, which helps deter brute-force attacks upon the hash or salt.
The iteration count is a power of two, which is an input to the algorithm. The number is encoded in the textual result.
There are implementations of bcrypt for Ruby, Python, C, C#, Perl, PHP, Java and other languages.
Algorithm.
The bcrypt algorithm depends heavily on its "Eksblowfish" key setup algorithm, which runs as follows:
InitState works as in the original Blowfish algorithm, populating the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of formula_5 in hexadecimal.
The ExpandKey function does the following:
Hence, codice_1 is the same as regular Blowfish key schedule since all XORs with the all-zero salt value are ineffectual. codice_2 is similar, but uses the salt as a 128-bit key.
The full bcrypt algorithm utilizes these functions to compute a hash from a given input derived from the password, as follows:
User input.
The mathematical algorithm itself requires initialization with 18 32-bit subkeys (equivalent to 72 octets/bytes). The original specification of bcrypt does not mandate any one particular method for mapping text-based passwords from userland into numeric values for the algorithm. One brief comment in the text mentions, but does not mandate, the possibility of simply using the ASCII encoded value of a character string, "Finally, the key argument is a secret encryption key, which can be a user-chosen password of up to 56 bytes (including a terminating zero byte when the key is an ASCII string)."
Note that the quote above mentions passwords "up to 56 bytes" even though the algorithm itself makes use of a 72 byte initial value. Although Provos and Mazières do not state the reason for the shorter restriction, they may have been motivated by the following statement from Bruce Schneier's original specification of Blowfish, "The 448 limit on the key size ensures that the[sic every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key."
Implementations have varied in their approach of converting passwords into initial numeric values, including sometimes reducing the strength of passwords containing special characters. See e.g. Feb 1, 2010 jBCrypt security advisory or Changes in CRYPT_BLOWFISH in PHP 5.3.7.

Ccrypt

ccrypt is a utility for the secure encryption and decryption of files and streams. It was designed as a replacement for the standard UNIX crypt utility, which is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm.
ccrypt is based on the Rijndael cypher, the same cipher used in the AES standard. However, in the AES standard a 128-bit block size is used, whereas ccrypt uses a 256-bit block size.

Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance Corps

The Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. is a not-for-profit EMS organization in Hackensack, New Jersey. The Corps serves the City of Hackensack, and nearby towns via mutual aid agreements. Its primary hours are 6pm to 6am Monday through Friday, and 24 hours on Saturday and Sunday. The Corps is available at any time for special events, emergency recall, or to assist the Hackensack University Medical Center's EMS during daytime hours.
Both the Hackensack University Medical Center and Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance Corps are dispatched by MICCOM, the Northern New Jersey Mobile Intensive Care Communications. MICCOM provides dispatch and emergency medical call taking with pre-arrival instructions and updates.
History.
The Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. was incorporated with nine charter members and one ambulance in May, 1948. The ambulances and members were housed in a small building located at the corner of The Esplanade and Central Avenue on the location of the current Nellie K. Parker Elementary School.
By the mid 1960s, the amount of emergency calls increased so much that the Corps had to buy three ambulances and recruit more volunteers so that they could serve the city effectively.
Originally, the Corps operated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. As time progressed, the number of emergency calls increased, and the Corps found it more and more difficult to recruit volunteers for the daytime shifts. The Hackensack Fire Department supplemented the ambulance service during daytime hours, Monday through Friday 6:00am to 6:00pm.
On February 14, 1974, the Hackensack Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. joined forces with Hackensack Hospital to form a cardiac unit, which was composed of a nurse, doctor, and a volunteer EMT. The Corps transported the nurse and doctor to the scene of life-threatening emergencies to initiate pre-hospital advanced life support procedures. This was the beginning of the Hackensack University Medical Center’s Mobile Intensive Care Paramedic Unit.
In 1976, after two years stationed behind the firehouse on South Summit Avenue, the Corps relocated to its present location behind the City Hall complex.
In September 2008, Hackensack's emergency medical communications operations became the responsibility of MICCOM (Northern New Jersey Mobile Intensive Care Communications). Improvements to the Corps and its fleet included the implementing of Global Positioning System (GPS), allowing MICCOM to dispatch the nearest unit.
As of January, 2010, the Corps is led by a Chief, Deputy Chief and two Captains.
Fleet.
The Corps currently operates four ambulances: one 2013 and two 2011 Frazer type-1 ambulances, a 1999 Wheeled Coach type-3 ambulance, as well as supervisor vehicles of 2013 Chev Tahoe and a 2004 Ford Crown Victoria. A multi use tralier equipped with an EMS gator and EMS bikes. 
Standard equipment on each ambulance includes: an automated external defibrillator (AED); epinephrine auto-injectors (Epi-Pen); oxygen administered via nasal cannulas; non rebreathing masks and bag valve masks; various length splints; oral glucose; sterile gauze bandages and medical tape; blood pressure cuffs; oral suction device. 
In 2012, the Corps purchased two Lucas Chest Compression systems, used for performing CPR on victims, freeing up the EMT and Paramedics to conduct other lifesaving measures.
The city-designated fleet numbers are 190, 191, 192, 193, 194 and 195 and are painted on the front and rear of each ambulance. MICOM designated the units as 1060, 1061, 1062...
Uniform.
The Corps' uniform consists of blue long-sleeve shirts, with the Corps' patch on the upper left arm and the NJ EMT patch on the upper right arm. Above the left breast pocket is a silver patch identifying the wearer as a Hackensack EMT. The uniform also includes matching pants and a belt. EMTs provide their own black shoes/boots.

4th &quot;Ali Demi&quot; Battalion

The 4th "Ali Demi" Battalion (, ) was a battalion under the 15th Regiment of Greek People's Liberation Army, founded during the Second World War. It comprised both from Cham Albanians and Greeks, of the region of Epirus and was established in May 1944. It consisted of 460 Muslim Albanians and 340 Orthodox Greeks, at the time of its creation. However, during the World War II occupation the majority of the elites of the Cham community had become corrupted by the occupying forces and the atmosphere against the local Greeks who had suffered under Germans, Italians and Chams, led to an explosive polarization which would have constrained any motivation for joint Greek-Cham resistance.
Background.
Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the Albanian Kingdom became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians used the Albanian minority in Greece, as an excuse to start the war. The final alibi was the alleged murder by Greek agents of a Cham Albanian leader. Although fascist Italy was defeated in the Greco-Italian War, a rapid German "Blitzkrieg" campaign followed in April 1941, and by the middle of May, Greece was under joint occupation by three Axis powers: Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. At this time Italy introduced a local administration called "Këshilla" in Thesprotia, which was supported by several hundred Cham Albanians. Some hundreds of Chams participated in the formation of the "Ali Demi" Battalion and the "Chameria" battalion 
One of the major resistance groups in Greece was the communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM), with its armed branch, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), founded in 27 September 1941. EAM evolved into the largest resistance group and the largest mass movement seen until then in Greece. ELAS initiated actions against the German and Italian forces of occupation in Greece on 7 June 1942 and it would become the resistance group in which Cham Albanians would found their battalion. Cham Albanians had been fighting the occupiers in unorganized small groups, under the lead of the National Anti-Fascist Liberation Army of Albania (NAFLA), which was created in September 1942, as the armed wing of the National Liberation Movement (NLM), inspired by the Communist Party of Albania. Later these Chams would create the "Chameria" battalion, under the Albanian Army.
Formation.
At the end of 1943, a group of Cham Albanians, led by Ali Demi, attacked a German garrison, in Vlora, Albania, killing 39 German troops and losing 12 members of the battalion, including Ali Demi himself. At this time, Greek People's Liberation Army, asked Cham Albanians living in Greece to create a battalion and to enlist in its ranks. Having a good relation with the Albanian Army, ELAS's and NAFLA's officers managed to persuade Chams to create armed forces under the ELAS army.
In May 1944, a group of local Cham Albanians, created the battalion named after Ali Demi, in the village Milea (), which was included in the 15th regiment of Greek People's Liberation Army. At the time of its creation it compromised around a thousand members, the vast majority of whom were Chams. The battalion consisted of 460 partisans, including Cham Albanians while the rest were Orthodox Albanians and Greeks of the region.
Participation in the war.
Being formed at the end of the war, the battalion had no significant contribution in fighting the occupation forces. More than 60 Chams were killed during a battle with German forces in Igoumenitsa. Other Cham Albanians were enlisted in VI, VII, IX and XI brigade of Greek People's Liberation Army, and fought in different mixed battalions of ELAS. After ELAS managed to enter Epirus, the battles of the battalion were against EDES, led by Napoleon Zervas. This was one of the reasons why EDES forces and the British Mission in Greece, attacked Cham Albanians when they controlled Epirus. The majority of battles occurred until 27 June 1944, when EDES forces started the ethnic cleansing of the region. 
After their expulsion, they formed in Albania the "National Anti-Fascist Cham Committee", which was disbanded in 1947, when Cham Albanians lost their refugee status.
Aftermath.
In an attempt to establish an ethnically pure border region, the Chams were evicted from northern Greece by guerrilla forces under the command of General Napoleon Zervas acting under the instructions of allied officers.
Two attacks took place in July and August with the participation of EDES Tenth Division and the local Greek peasants, eager to gain revenge for the burning of their own homes. According to Cham testimonies, which are unconfirmed by Western reports, the most infamous massacre of Albanian Muslims by Greek irregulars occurred on 27 June 1944 in the district of Paramythia, when this forces entered the town and killed approximately 600 Muslim Chams, men, women and children.
When ELAS briefly gained control of the Thesprotia region in late 1944, about four to five thousand Albanians returned to their homes. But after the Varkiza Agreement, EDES forces again expelled them, killing about 300 Muslim Cham Albanians in the process, while Orthodox Chams were allowed to stay in Greece.
This region, as others in Northern Greece, became the heart of the Greek Civil War between the communist ELAS and the anti-communist forces of EDES and the Greek government, backed by the British allies.

John Harold Westgarth Voelcker (1927-1972) was a British architect and designer. He was the first Professor of Architecture at the University of Glasgow.
Voelcker was born in Preston, Lancashire. He studied at the Architectural Association (AA) and then worked in Milan, later returning to London, where he became a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects.
In the early 1950s Voelcker was a member of Team 10, dominated by Peter and Alison Smithson, but later split with the group. In 1954 he moved to Kent where he developed a country practice creating designs for farm improvements, school and office buildings. He also worked on houses and housing schemes for local authorities and businesses. At the same time he taught in various capacities concerning planning and public design, including work at the AA School and Cambridge University.
In 1956 Voelcker collaborated with Richard Hamilton and John McHale on the seminal "This is Tomorrow" exhibition, for which Voelcker designed the structure of their part of the exhibition.
In 1958 a dispute with local planning authorities over a building designed for the Jazz musician Humphrey Lyttelton led to Voelcker and Lyttelton successfully challenging the authorities. The building was a dramatic U-shaped structure and included a "splendidly witty" pop art mural by McHale. As a result of their defence of creative architecture Voelcker and Lyttelton were named the "Architect's Journals men of the year.
In 1965 he became director of Senior Studies at the AA School. Three years later in 1969 Voelcker became Professor of Architecture at Glasgow. He held the position until his early death.

Ercole Manfredi

Ercole Pietro Manfredi (2 July 1883 – 9 June 1973) was an Italian architect who lived and worked in early twentieth-century Siam (now Thailand). Born in Turin, Italy, he attended the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts before travelling to Bangkok, where he was one of many Westerners employed by the Siamese government.
He made significant career progress through the court of King Vajiravudh, but left government office to work privately as the country was going through political change which abolished absolute monarchy and decreased government employment of foreigners. However, by adopting a Thai identity and way of life, marrying a Thai woman and settling down permanently, Manfredi remained a relevant and respected figure in Thai architecture, and later became a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. His works include various royal residences and public institutions, ranging in style from Venetian Gothic to modernist, and incorporated Thai traditional styles as well. He contributed to much of Bangkok's architectural heritage, but no complete records of his works were kept.
Early life.
Ercole Pietro Manfredi was born on 2 July 1883 in Turin, Italy to Luigi Manfredi and Caterina Bo. He attended the Lagrange Royal Technical School starting in 1894 and the San Carlo Technical School from 1898 to 1899. At the age of sixteen, he was admitted into the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts, where during his studies he received a first prize in architecture, design, perspective and painting. He received a diploma in 1907 and subsequently attended the Higher Course in Architecture. During this time he also worked for Turin's Public and Municipal Works Department, where he supervised constructions and patented an earthquake engineering system. In 1909, he graduated with a High Qualification as painter and architect, receiving a gold medal first prize in addition to fifteen other prizes won during his studies.
Career.
In 1909, Manfredi was selected by the academy to fill an architect position for the government of Siam (now Thailand). Sailing from Genoa, he arrived in Bangkok on 1 December. He was placed under the Architectural Section of the Ministry of Public Works working under engineer-in-chief Carlo Allegri and Minister Prince Naresra Varariddhi. He collaborated with many Italian architects employed by the government including Mario Tamagno, who was the department's chief architect, and others who were involved in the construction of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Many of these architects were in fact also from Turin or alumni of Albertina.
In 1912, Manfredi was promoted to a position in the Ministry of the Royal Household, where he worked closely with King Vajiravudh and Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs. He was subsequently promoted to Chief Architect and third court officer in 1917 and first court officer in 1921. In 1920, he was appointed the post of naval architect, with the rank of lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Scout Corps, which was the king's private battalion in the Wild Tiger Corps para-military movement. He later became Chief Architect of the Archaeological Section of the Royal Institute in 1926. During his service to the government, he was decorated with the Order of the Crown of Siam (commander, 1913), the Dushdi Mala Medal for artistic merit (1915), and the Order of the White Elephant (commander, 1920). He was also awarded the gold medal prize at the Bangkok Fine Arts Exhibition in 1917.
In 1930, during the period of political turmoil leading up to the abolition of absolute monarchy in the Siamese Revolution of 1932, Manfredi retired from government office. For a while, he pursued archaeological studies as an assistant to the French archaeologist George Coedes. He then continued his work as architect privately cooperating with Christiani & Nielsen (Siam) Ltd. from 1934 to 1936 and the Impresitor Company from 1937 to 1938.
In 1939, Manfredi became a lecturer at the Faculty of Architecture of Chulalongkorn University, where he taught for eight years. He also served as a lecturer in the Signalling Division of the Royal Thai Navy from 1944 to 1950 before retiring from public life.
Personal life.
In Siam, Manfredi adopted the local culture and way of life. He dressed and ate like a Thai, mingled with Thai friends, and used an abacus to calculate. His government contract had required him "to be able within one year to converse in Siamese in a tolerable way," but he went further and became fluent in both the spoken and written language.
Manfredi married a Thai wife, Thongmuan (), with Buddhist rites in 1913. They had two daughters and lived together in what he described as "years of paradise". He left the country only twice, in 1925 and 1928, to represent Siam at the second and third International Book Fairs in Florence.
Following the revolution of 1932, rising nationalistic sentiments resulted in a large decline in the role and numbers of Westerners working for the government. Manfredi was among the few who remained in Thailand. Like Corrado Feroci, he took up a Thai name, Ekkarit Manfendi (), and received Thai nationality on 29 November 1943. By adopting a Thai identity, he remained a relevant and respected figure in the Thai field of architecture.
Manfredi was involved in various humanitarian and cultural organisations. He was a member of the Siam and the Italian Red Cross, the Siam Teachers' Association, the Automobile Club of Siam, and the Alliance française. He also maintained links with his Italian roots, and was a member in the Dante Alighieri Society, the Colonial Italian Institute, and the Italian Touring Club. He was also selected as a correspondent member of the Italian Book Institute of Florence in 1929.
Manfredi has been described as rather eccentric for a foreigner in Siam at the time. In an interview, his daughter Maly Manfredi remarked that he was "an odd number". He was also noted to be impulsive and stubborn, often ignoring his wife's sensible advice to do what he wanted, including leaving his official post to pursue archaeology. According to Maly, "as court architect, he used to fly into a rage at the suppliers' gifts," and "Papa needed a big organisation to discipline him, like the Court or Chulalongkorn University." At the age of seventy-five, Manfredi realised his dream project of building a boat; to finance, he had to sell his entire collection of Siamese art. He named the boat "Mammino", and used it mostly for pleasure cruises to Pattaya.
Manfredi lived in Thailand until his death on 9 June 1973. He and his wife (who died six years later) were interred at the Christian cemetery at Ban Pong, Ratchaburi.
Works.
Manfredi contributed to much of Bangkok's architecture and also produced works of painting and sculpture. However, he did not keep a record of his contributions, and his employment by the government means that many of his designs were not attributed. He also produced architectural works during his time in Turin, but his work during the brief period make up only a minority of his accomplishments.
Architecture.
Manfredi's architectural works involve both Thai and Western designs, which he adapted and developed to suit the local tradition. The more notable of these consist of royal palaces and villas; he also designed buildings for various public institutions.
Upon his arrival in Bangkok in 1909, Manfredi collaborated with other Italian architects in the construction of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, which had begun in 1908 and lasted until 1915. Manfredi was mainly responsible for the dome and the roof of the building, which was designed in the Italian Renaissance and neoclassical styles and modelled in part after the Basilica of Superga. "Much of that copper covering the Hall, I put on with my own hands," he said in an interview with the "Bangkok Post" in 1967. He also contributed to the decorations and was responsible for later work on the building's foundations.
He acted as chief architect for Mrigadayavan Palace in Cha Am and was in charge of its construction, which took place from 1923 to 1924. Designs for the seaside villa were sketched by King Vajiravudh and implemented by Manfredi. The palace consists of sixteen buildings and incorporates the Thai manner of elevated buildings with Western style and details. He also contributed to the design and construction of Villa Norasingh (1923–25), now the Thai Khu Fa Building of the Government House, although it is not officially attributed to him. The building was constructed mainly in the Venetian Gothic style and has a façade resembling that of Venice's Ca' d'Oro. He was not satisfied with the results, saying in a 1967 interview, "I built it in the Venetian style because I thought that Bangkok was the Venice of the East. Now I am so ashamed of it. It is not just right for this clima."
Manfredi produced many modernist designs in the 1930s. These include Manfredi Residence (1935) and Asawin Villa (c.1930s), which were influenced by the Bauhaus school and are among the first modernist buildings in Thailand. The decade saw widespread adoption of the International style for public and educational institutions. Among these are Manfredi's designs for the Rajvithi School of Nursing (c.1930s) and the Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Dentistry (1939). Influences by the neoplastic (De Stijl) movement are seen in his designs for Triam Udom Suksa School (1934–1940). He also designed Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Fine Arts building, as well as the Chemistry and Physics buildings of the Faculty of Science.
Other contributions by Manfredi include:
Sculpture.
Manfredi did not specialise in sculpture, but two such works by him are known. They are the marble guardian lions at Wat Benchamabophit and the statue of Jarlet, King Vajiravudh's beloved dog, at Sanam Chandra Palace.
Painting.
Having focused on painting early in his studies, Manfredi produced many visual works but was not well known for them. Most of his paintings have been dispersed; he sometimes gave them freely to friends and sold most of his possessions late in life. His known painted works include the following:
Other works.
Manfredi designed scenes and costumes to be used in King Vajiravudh's theatrical plays, most notably that of the king's Thai adaptation of "The Merchant of Venice". He did not limit his contributions to the arts, but also worked on engineering projects. He improved on the mechanics involved in the royal funeral procession and was particularly interested in developing an irrigation system for the country.

UAV Outback Challenge

The UAV Challenge - Outback Rescue, often referred to as simply the UAV Outback Challenge or UAV Challenge, began in 2007 and has been held every year since. The event is aimed at promoting the civilian use of unmanned aerial vehicles and the development of low-cost systems that could be used for search and rescue missions. The events have been cooperative efforts between a number of organisations with interests in furthering the use of unmanned aircraft in civilian applications. There is a thorough scoring system with a clear emphasis on safety, capability and technical excellence. The format of the Challenge changed in 2011 with the Search and Rescue Challenge moving to a two-year long event. 
The event is one of the largest robotics challenges in the world and one of the highest stakes UAV challenges, with $50,000 on offer to the winner of the Search and Rescue segment of the Challenge. The Search and Rescue Challenge takes place in Kingaroy, Queensland, Australia at the airport.
Challenges.
Search and Rescue Challenge.
The Search and Rescue Challenge is open for worldwide participation by universities and hobbyists. 
'Outback Joe' is lost in the Australian outback and in need of assistance. Teams must develop a platform to accurately pinpoint the simulated target and accurately deliver an emergency package via an airdrop. The mission area is nearly from the airport and is approximately x . Teams must not fly greater than 1500 ft above ground level (AGL). 
The overall mission requirements are targeted towards safety, excellence of the platform and innovation. There are a number of milestones leading up to the challenge dates.
Airborne Delivery Challenge.
This challenge is open to Australian high school students. The objective is to create a future generation of aerospace professionals with a focus on UAVs. 
An airframe has to be built and the mission is executed by two persons who will not communicate during the mission and will have technological targeting solutions in place: 
Other team members are permitted and many teams have roles for a team manager, media manager and safety manager.
In 2009 and 2010 a Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge was also held in parallel to the main Airborne Delivery Challenge. The Robot competition was dropped in 2011 in favor of bonus points for autonomous payload dropping in the Airborne Delivery Challenge.
It was reported, just prior to the 2011 event, that the UAV Challenge had inspired nineteen-year-old Chelsea Redman to become an aerospace engineer.
Outback Joe.
Outback Joe is the target of the Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenges. Joe is a mysterious local bushwalker that tends to get lost near Kingaroy airport every September. He is represented by a 50 kg mannequin dressed in jeans, a work shirt, work boots and the iconic Australian hat, the Akubra. In 2010, Outback Joe was spotted from the aircraft of the University of North Dakota team lying next to his broken down "ute". This was the first time he had been located by a Search and Rescue team. In 2012, the Canberra UAV team's aircraft automatically located Outback Joe - the first fully automatic detection during all events. Teams, spectators (at the event and remote) and media keep up-to-date with Outback Joe's antics by following outback_joe on Twitter and Outback Joe on Facebook.
Rod Walker.
The UAV Challenge was conceived in late 2005 by Rodney Walker (QUT), Jonathan Roberts (CSIRO) and George Curran (CSIRO). Their idea was to create an annual event that would help develop young people's enthusiasm and skills in the UAV industry and help educate the general public on the potential roles of UAVs in non-military situations. Rod Walker, a Professor at Queensland University of Technology, died in October 2011, aged 42. Canberra UAV, the first placed team in the 2012 Search and Rescue event were awarded the inaugural Rod Walker Trophy. A memorial fund was set up to support individuals and organisations that try to enhance the use of UAVs for civilian purposes.
The Kingaroy Triangle.
The term The Kingaroy Triangle was coined during the second UAV Challenge event in 2008 when it was noticed that aircraft and systems that had worked perfectly well before the UAV Challenge suddenly appeared to have problems at Kingaroy. The term is a reference to the more famous Bermuda Triangle and also a reference to the general shape of the competition boundary area, which is roughly triangular in nature.
Annual challenges.
2013 competition.
2013 was a high-school only event with the international Search and Rescue Challenge starting that year but running for two years (with its own event at Kingaroy, Queensland, Australia planned for September 2014).
For the second time, the Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately west of Ipswich, Queensland). The Challenge took place between September 24 and 25. The competition was very close and was notable because for the first time a high-school team (The Hexfactor for Mueller College) managed to achieve a successful autonomous drop of a chocolate bar to Outback Joe, landing within the required 10m distance to be award bonus points. Although the Hexfactor did not win the event, the fact that they succeeded with some autonomy was a milestone for the UAV Challenge.
In 2013 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (a QUT research centre) and CSIRO. It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Mathworks. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government, the Australian Association for Unmanned Systems, and UAS-Pacific. The event also had the assistance of personnel from VTOL-Aerospace and Aviation Australia.
2012 competition.
The 2012 event was held at Kingaroy October 1–3 and followed a similar format to the 2010 competition with both a Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenge. The 2012 Search and Rescue competition actually began in 2011 when the competition was lengthened to 18 months in duration. 2012 saw the introduction of the Search Phase as part of the Airborne Delivery Challenge competitions.
Over 70 teams registered for the Search and Rescue Challenge, with 63 passing the first checkpoint. Over the subsequent 18 months the field was reduced to just six, the rest having either failed to pass certain milestones or withdrawing due to technical difficulties such as crashes. At the event in Kingaroy, four teams launched their aircraft into the range. The main task was not completed by any of the teams. However, two teams did manage to complete a significant portion of their search phase and successfully returned their aircraft to the airport. Team Canberra UAV achieved automatic detection of Outback Joe - the first team to do so in the history of the event. They did not manage to drop the bottle of water due to an in-flight incident prior to the Outback Joe detection when it appeared that the water bottle became loose from the aircraft and fell off.
Thirteen teams competed in the Airborne Delivery Challenge with a winner declared for its Search Phase. The Airmanship Award was sponsored by Insitu Pacific and was awarded to Nina Clark for her outstanding team leadership.
In 2012 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO), AUVS-Australia and Aviation Development Australia Limited. It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, CASA, Mathworks, Aviation Australia, Stanwell Corporation Limited and DSTO. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government, South Burnett Regional Council, UAS-Pacific, the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global, the Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development, and Australian Defence Magazine. The event also had the assistance of personnel from Raytheon, the Royal Australian Navy and the Victoria Police Air Wing.
2011 competition (new format).
On 16 March 2011, the UAV Challenge organizers announced major changes to the format of the Challenges. Stated changes included a new longer format Search and Rescue Challenge that results in an event at Kingaroy being held every two years instead of every year (as was done from 2007 to 2010) and the development of Australian State Championships for the Airborne Delivery Challenge. The organizers were quoted as saying that they believe this will lead to "more participants competing with a very high standard of UAV capability". 
For the first time, the event was not held at Kingaroy. Instead an Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately west of Ipswich, Queensland) between September 27 and 28.
In 2011 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO) and AUVS-Australia. It was sponsored by Queensland Government, had the assistance of Ipswich City Council, and technical staff from Boeing, UAS Pacific and Skills Queensland.
2010 competition.
The 2010 UAV Challenge took place between September 27 and 29. In the Search and Rescue competition a team from the University of North Dakota became the first in UAV Challenge history to successfully locate Outback Joe, managing to pinpoint his location to within 15 m (from 800 ft AGL). However, they failed to drop a water bottle within 100 m (as required by the rules) and hence did not win the A$50,000 prize. Team Robota, from Texas, was awarded second place after their aircraft successfully entered the search area but had to abort the mission due to a technical issue. A total of 49 teams entered the Search and Rescue competition with only six flying at the event.
In 2010 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO), Queensland Government and Aviation Development Australia Limited. It was sponsored by Insitu, CASA, Australian Defence Magazine, AUVS-Australia, Boeing, CAE Inc. and South Burnett Regional Council.
2009 competition.
The 2009 UAV Challenge was announced in the December/January 2008 issue of Aviation Business Asia Pacific magazine. The 2009 event took place between September 28 and October 1. The combined challenge award funds were A$70,000.00. In addition to the traditional Search and Rescue Challenge and Airborne Delivery Challenge, there was a new Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge open to high-school students. The two separate documentary challenges of the previous years were combined into a single Documentary Challenge.
2009 was the first year that teams managed to enter the search area. Team Galah suffered an engine shutdown just inside the search area and made an emergency landing less than 100 m from Outback Joe (although they were not aware of this at the time). Team Melbourne UAV were en route to the search area when high wind conditions flipped their aircraft causing it to enter flight termination mode. The airframe was lost due to high impact with the ground.
In 2009 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.
2008 competition.
The 2008 UAV Outback Challenge was held between September 22 and 24 and had a combined prize fund of A$70,000. The prize for completing the Search and Rescue Challenge was increased to A$50,000. 51 teams from 8 different countries expressed an interest in entering with 17 finally qualifying for the event. As in 2007, teams failed to complete the Search and Rescue mission, with no teams passing stringent flight scrutineering and hence no flights left the airport for the search area. 
In 2008 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.
2007 competition.
The first event was held between September 24 and 27. It attracted interest from 43 teams from 6 countries of whom 20 submitted full entries. No teams passed flight scrutineering although Team Dionysus from the USA did demonstrate some autonomous flight at the airport. MUROC I, a high school team from Mueller College, won the inaugural Payload Delivery Challenge. 
In 2007 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.

The Irish Queer Archive – a vast collection of material which provides insights into the social, cultural and political history of the LGBT communities in an Irish and interna- tional context during the latter half of the 20th century – was presented in 2008 to the National Library of Ireland following a decision to donate it by the National LGBT Federation. IQA is a living archive and continues to accept donations and deposits.
Background.
Post Stonewall ‘69, Irish lesbian and gay groups and individual activists have laboured to document their history; a history that ultimately touches on all of Irish life in the 20th century. Well-preserved yet incomplete records bear witness to the nascent lesbian and gay civil rights era of the early 1970s. Organisations like the Northern Irish Gay Rights Association (NIGRA), Irish Gay Rights Movement (IGRM) and the National LGBT Federation (NXF) maintained a tradition of preservation with keen forsight, often at considerable expense and with limited human resources. 
As one of the largest, oldest and continuous lesbian/gay corporate organisations in Ireland, NLGF has been to the forefront of maintaining some semblance of an archive. From the late ‘70s onwards this was confined to a rudimentary press clippings service and some limited research by, amongst others, activists Edmund Lynch, David Norris and Tom McClean. Like many corporations NXF has also managed to acquire or subsume the interests and records of other smaller, often more specialised, groups. One example of this is the entire archive of Out, Ireland's first commercial monthly gay magazine (1984-1988). The Out holding typically includes proofed manuscripts, original artwork, administrative and financial files, photographs, illustrations and file copies.
From 1980 onwards a larger group of people in NXF helped maintain and preserve documents and cuttings. NXF capitalised on years of acquisition by holding onto a huge number of international titles that were surplus to ILGA’s requirements when the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) moved its information secretariat from Dublin to Stockholm in 1982. This collection constitutes the bedrock of the archive's library of international titles dating back to 1951. 
The archive and reference library was put on a more organised footing in Midsummer 1997 when NXF and GCN moved into new premises on South William Street, Dublin. At that point, civil rights activist Tonie Walsh, along with librarians Linda Forry and Plunkett Conroy, began a systematic re-organisation of its holdings. A limited public office was set up in a short time, facilitating researchers, students and historians, in addition to servicing the research needs of journalists at Gay Community News. 
Although it struggled financially in the following years with finding suitable, affordable office and storage accommodation, NLGF lost no time in appointing a group of academics, historians and writers to focus on exploiting the collections and making suggestions for a future safe home. This IQA group consisted of Dr. Eibhear Walshe, lecturer in English at UCC; Dr. Mary McAuliffe and Dr. Katherine O’Donnell, both of Gender Studies at UCD; Joan Murphy, an RTÉ archivist; librarian Elizabeth Kirwan of NLI; and Tonie Walsh, coincidentally a former president of NXF and founding editor of Gay Community News (GCN).
Extensive overtures and negotiations with Gerry Lyne (since retired) of the Department of Manuscripts at the National Library of Ireland ultimately bore fruit when it was agreed in 2008 to transfer the collections to NLI. The historic transfer of IQA to NLI was also hugely symbolic as it signalled the Irish state taking ownership of LGBT heritage. However, given the size of the archive, much work needs to be done in filing, cataloguing and ultimately digitising the entire collection.IQA holdings that have been made accessible are described as Manuscripts Collection List No. 151. Further information may be gleaned from the National Library website: www.nli.ie.
An advisory group, composed of many of the above-mentioned individuals, continues to focus on opportunities to help the National Library of Ireland exploit its collection. Regular cultural updates are featured on its Facebook page: www.facebook.com/IQAadvisorygroup.

Transportation in Kentucky

Transportation in Kentucky includes roads, airports, waterways and rail.
Roads.
Kentucky is served by six major interstate highways (I-24, I-64, I-65, I-69, I-71, I-75), nine parkways, and three bypasses and spurs. The parkways were originally toll roads, but on November 22, 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher ended the toll charges on the William H. Natcher Parkway and the Audubon Parkway, the last two parkways in Kentucky to charge tolls for access. The related toll booths have been demolished.
Ending the tolls some seven months ahead of schedule was generally agreed to have been a positive economic development for transportation in Kentucky. In June 2007, a law went into effect raising the speed limit on rural portions of Kentucky Interstates from to .
Road tunnels include the interstate Cumberland Gap Tunnel and the rural Nada Tunnel.
Greyhound provides bus service to most major towns in the state.
Rail.
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Ashland, South Portsmouth and Fulton, Kentucky. The Cardinal, Trains 50 and 51, is the line that offers Amtrak service to Ashland and South Portsmouth. Amtrak Trains 58 and 59, the City of New Orleans, serve Fulton. The Northern Kentucky area, is served by the Cardinal at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. The Museum Center is just across the Ohio River in Cincinnati.
As of 2004, there were approximately 2,640 miles (4,250.4 km) of railways in Kentucky, with about 65% of those being operated by CSX Transportation. Coal was by far the most common cargo, accounting for 76% of cargo loaded and 61% of cargo delivered.
Bardstown features a tourist attraction known as "My Old Kentucky Dinner Train". Run along a stretch of rail purchased from CSX in 1987, guests are served a four-course meal as they make a two-and-a-half hour round-trip between Bardstown and Limestone Springs. The Kentucky Railway Museum is located in nearby New Haven. 
Other areas in Kentucky are reclaiming old railways in rail trail projects. One such project is Louisville's Big Four Bridge. If completed, the Big Four Bridge rail trail will contain the second longest pedestrian-only bridge in the world. The longest pedestrian-only bridge is also found in Kentucky — the Newport Southbank Bridge, popularly known as the "Purple People Bridge", connecting Newport to Cincinnati, Ohio.
Air.
Kentucky's primary airports include Louisville International Airport (Standiford Field), Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Blue Grass Airport in Lexington. Louisville International Airport is home to UPS's Worldport, its international air-sorting hub. There are also a number of regional airports scattered across the state.
On August 27, 2006, Kentucky's Blue Grass Airport in Lexington was the site of a crash that killed 47 passengers and 2 crew members aboard a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet designated Comair Flight 191, or Delta Air Lines Flight 5191, sometimes mistakenly identified by the press as Comair Flight 5191. The lone survivor was the flight's first officer, James Polehinke, who doctors determined to be brain damaged and unable to recall the crash at all.
Water.
Being bounded by the two largest rivers in North America, water transportation has historically played a major role in Kentucky's economy. Most barge traffic on Kentucky waterways consists of coal that is shipped from both the Eastern and Western Coalfields, about half of which is used locally to power many power plants located directly off the Ohio River, with the rest being exported to other countries, most notably Japan.
Many of the largest ports in the United States are located in or adjacent to Kentucky, including:
As a state, Kentucky ranks 10th overall in port tonnage.
The only natural obstacle along the entire length of the Ohio River was the Falls of the Ohio, located just west of Downtown Louisville.

Wolvercot Platform railway station

Wolvercot Platform was a halt on the Great Western Railway line between Oxford and Banbury. The line is now known as the Cherwell Valley Line or the "Oxford Canal Line".
History.
The platform was opened on 1 February 1908; it was situated on the north side of Godstow Road, and served the village of Wolvercote, but was spelt "Wolvercot" to try to reduce confusion with the nearby Wolvercote Halt on the London and North Western Railway's Varsity Line. Although only a halt, Wolvercot had once been staffed and during the First World War it became the first station to have a stationmistress. The lady in question was Miss Margaret Elsden, sister of Mr A.H. Elsden who became stationmaster at . Margaret Elsden later married Frank Buckingham who became stationmaster at .
The GWR closed Wolvercot Platform on 1 January 1916. Wolvercot Siding signalbox, a 29-lever hipped roof structure which survived the closure, controlled the level crossing over Godstow Road as well as vehicular access to the adjacent meadows. The down starter in Wolvercot Siding carried the distant arms for Wolvercot Junction, to the north, where the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Line diverged north-westwards from the Birmingham Main Line.
Route.
Services were provided by steam railmotors based at Oxford, which was also the southern terminus; the northern terminus of these services was , , or .

<doc id="21564743" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21564743" title="Culture of Kentucky">
Culture of Kentucky

Although Kentucky's culture is generally considered to be Southern, it is unique in that it is also influenced by the Midwest and Southern Appalachia in certain areas of the state. The state is known for bourbon and whiskey distilling, tobacco, horse racing, and college basketball. Kentucky is more similar to the Upper South in terms of ancestry which is predominantly American. Nevertheless, during the 19th century, Kentucky did receive a substantial number of German immigrants, who settled mostly in the Midwest, along the Ohio river primarily in Louisville, Covington, and Newport. Only Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia have higher German ancestry percentages than Kentucky among Census-defined Southern states, although Kentucky's percentage is closer to Virginia's than the previously named state's percentages. Kentucky was a slave state, and blacks once comprised over one-quarter of its population. However, it lacked the cotton plantation system and never had the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states. With less than 8% of its current population being black, Kentucky is rarely included in modern-day definitions of the Black Belt, despite a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state.
Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the Civil War, but the state never disenfranchised African American citizens to the level of the Deep South states, and it peacefully integrated its schools after the 1954 "Brown v. Board of Education" verdict, later adopting the first state civil rights act in the South in 1966.
The biggest day in horse racing, the Kentucky Derby, is preceded by the two-week Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville. Louisville also plays host to the Kentucky State Fair, the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, and Southern gospel's annual highlight, the National Quartet Convention. Owensboro, Kentucky's third largest city, gives credence to its nickname of "Barbecue Capital of the World" by hosting the annual International Bar-B-Q Festival. Bowling Green, Kentucky's fourth (and soon to be third) largest city and home to the only assembly plant in the world that manufactures the Chevrolet Corvette, opened the National Corvette Museum in 1994.
Old Louisville, the largest historic preservation district in the United States featuring Victorian architecture and the third largest overall, hosts the St. James Court Art Show, the largest outdoor art show in the United States. The neighborhood was also home to the Southern Exposition (1883–1887), which featured the first public display of Thomas Edison's light bulb, and was the setting of Alice Hegan Rice's novel, "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch" and Fontaine Fox's comic strip, the "Toonerville Trolley.
The more rural communities are not without traditions of their own, however. Hodgenville, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, hosts the annual Lincoln Days Celebration, and will also host the kick-off for the National Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Celebration in February 2008. Bardstown celebrates its heritage as a major bourbon-producing region with the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. (Legend holds that Baptist minister Elijah Craig invented bourbon with his black slave in Georgetown, but some dispute this claim.) Glasgow mimics Glasgow, Scotland by hosting the Glasgow Highland Games, its own version of the Highland Games, and Sturgis hosts "Little Sturgis", a mini version of Sturgis, South Dakota's annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The residents of tiny Benton even pay tribute to their favorite tuber, the sweet potato, by hosting Tater Day. Residents of Clarkson in Grayson County celebrate their city's ties to the honey industry by celebrating the Clarkson Honeyfest. The Clarkson Honeyfest is held the last Thursday, Friday and Saturday in September, and is the "Official State Honey Festival of Kentucky." 
Colonel Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, is one of the most highly recognized figures in the world. Laurel County, Kentucky, located in the heart of the beautiful Daniel Boone National Forest, is proud to be the home of the Colonel's first and original restaurant established in the 1940s. Lee Cummings, co-founder of Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken, also began his career in 1952 with his uncle, Colonel Sanders, in Laurel County. The Annual World Chicken Festival is a tribute to this heritage. The international celebration, the last full weekend of every September, is held in beautiful downtown London. Entertainment for four fun filled day makes this one of Kentucky's largest festivals
Music.
The breadth of music in Kentucky is indeed wide, stretching from the Purchase to the eastern mountains.
Renfro Valley, Kentucky is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as "Kentucky's Country Music Capital," a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley's musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like Red Foley, Homer & Jethro, Lily May Ledford & the Original Coon Creek Girls, Martha Carson, and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The Renfro Valley Gatherin' is today America's second oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind. It is broadcast on local radio station WRVK and a syndicated network of nearly 200 other stations across the United States and Canada every week.
Contemporary Christian music star Steven Curtis Chapman is a Paducah native, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers The Everly Brothers are closely connected with Muhlenberg County, where older brother Don was born. Kentucky was also home to Mildred and Patty Hill, the Louisville sisters credited with composing the tune to the ditty Happy Birthday to You in 1893; Loretta Lynn (Johnson County), and Billy Ray Cyrus (Flatwoods). However, its depth lies in its signature sound — Bluegrass music. Bill Monroe, "The Father of Bluegrass", was born in the small Ohio County town of Rosine, while Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, David "Stringbean" Akeman, Louis Marshall "Grandpa" Jones, Sonny and Bobby Osborne, and Sam Bush (who has been compared to Monroe) all hail from Kentucky. The International Bluegrass Music Museum is located in Owensboro, while the annual Festival of the Bluegrass is held in Lexington.
Kentucky is also home to famed jazz musician and pioneer, Lionel Hampton (although this has been disputed in recent years). Blues legend W.C. Handy and R&B singer Wilson Pickett also spent considerable time in Kentucky. The pop bands Midnight Star and Nappy Roots were both formed in Kentucky, as were country acts The Kentucky Headhunters, Montgomery Gentry and Halfway to Hazard, as well as Dove Award-winning Christian groups Audio Adrenaline (rock) and Bride (metal).
Cuisine.
Kentucky's cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking. Although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest. One original Kentucky dish is called the Hot Brown, a dish normally layered in this order: toast, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with mornay sauce. It was developed at the Brown Hotel in Louisville. The Pendennis Club in Louisville is the birthplace of the "Old Fashioned" cocktail. Also, western Kentucky is known for its own regional style of barbecue.

Simoom Sound, British Columbia

Simoom Sound is a post office located at Echo Bay, British Columbia, Canada, on Gilford Island in the Central Coast region adjacent to the body of water of the same name, which was named for HMS "Simoom". The name formerly applied to a location on the nearby Wishart Peninsula as a steamer landing but was moved to Echo Bay when the former location became depopulated.
History of the name and its location.
Simoom Sound Post Office was opened 1 August 1912, located at SE 1/4 Lot 761 on the Wishart Peninsula facing Simoom Sound (50º50'10" - 126º30'05" as labelled on BC map 1EM, 1919). Some time before 28 June 1943 the post office was moved to the west side of Gilford Island (likely at the seaplane base 50º45'35" - 126º29'10" outside Echo Bay). Some time before February 1967 the post office was moved less than 1 mile south into the settlement at Echo Bay. January 1983 decision by Canada Post to close the post office was evidently reversed, and the Simoom Sound Post Office - located in the settlement of Echo Bay - remains open.

Memory Bridge

Memory Bridge, founded in 2004 as The Foundation for Alzheimer’s and Cultural Memory, is an American non-profit organization that creates programs that connect people with Alzheimer's disease to family, friends, and other people in their local community.
Mission.
The mission of Memory Bridge is:
“ To create a global community of people who, like us, are learning to listen to people with dementia for what they have to teach us about our own humanity.” Approximately 5 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease.
Action Directives.
Memory Bridge’s action directives are:
Programs.
The Memory Bridge Initiative is a twelve week, curriculum-based after-school program for junior high and high school students. Students are paired with residents of nearby long-term care facilities with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. The student and person with dementia meet four times over the twelve week course. The program develops students’ emotional and social intelligence while keeping individuals with Alzheimer’s disease in long-term care facilities meaningfully connected to people in their community. 
The Memory Bridge Initiative follows a curriculum that was created by The Foundation for Alzheimer’s and Cultural Memory. The curriculum uses diverse approaches to learning, combining individual reflection, arts projects, group discussion, and role-playing to teach empathy and communication skills. Memory Bridge has also created experiential modules in conjunction with experts in their fields to facilitate relationship-building through photography, dance, music, and touch. The Memory Bridge Initiative began in Chicago in January 2005 and has since been adopted by schools and long-term care facilities in Texas, Vermont, and Ohio In 2006, the Memory Bridge Initiative received the Innovative Program Award from the Illinois Council on Long Term Care.
"There Is a Bridge".
"There Is a Bridge" is a documentary, hosted by former United States Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, that was released in September 2007 by Memory Bridge. “The film weaves together mental health, psychology, art, philosophy and education to highlight the individuals and programs reaching out to elders suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Moving and provocative, the documentary illuminates the possibility for meaningful connections regardless of a person's cognitive impairments.” The documentary airs on PBS stations nationwide.
Memory Bridge Forum.
The Memory Bridge Forum was created as an online space for family members, professional caregivers, and people with dementia to share their stories of communication and connection. With stories submitted from countries around the world – India, Israel, and Mexico among them – the forum is one of the ways Memory Bridge connects people who are learning to listen to people with Alzheimer’s disease.

Basketball.
St. Louis was home to two National Basketball Association teams (the St. Louis Hawks and the St. Louis Bombers) and also to the American Basketball Association's Spirits of St. Louis before the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976.
Soccer.
St. Louis has long had a reputation as being one of America's soccer hotbeds, and is home to what is arguably the richest soccer history in the nation, despite not hosting a Major League Soccer franchise. St. Louis has a strong tradition of prep and select soccer, which is followed very closely by many people in the city. It has been suggested that prep soccer in St. Louis enjoys a similar following to prep hockey in Minnesota.

St. Louis also was the home of the St. Louis Steamers, an indoor soccer team that played in St. Louis from 1979-1988. The Steamers averaged over 17,000 fans during their peak, outdrawing the St. Louis Blues NHL team.
Officials attempted to pave the way for a St. Louis area expansion team based in Collinsville, IL to enter Major League Soccer in 2009; however, MLS awarded the 16th franchise to Philadelphia instead. 
The Saint Louis Athletica competed in Women's Professional Soccer from 2009 to 2010. Athletica played its home matches on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and later moved to Scott Gallagher Soccer Park in west county. The team folded in May 2010 when donors did not continue to fund the team.
The St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame, established in 1971, is located at the Midwest Soccer Academy and includes a museum with various exhibits. The first annual dinner was held in 1971.
Corkball.
St. Louis is also one of the few cities in the country that plays host to local Corkball leagues. Corkball is a "mini-baseball" game featuring a 1.6 oz. ball and bat with a barrel that measures just 1.5". Corkball is St. Louis's classic baseball game. Originally played on the streets and alleys of St. Louis in the early 1900s, today the game has leagues formed around the country as a result of St. Louis servicemen introducing the game to their buddies during World War II and the Korean War. It has many of the features of baseball, yet can be played in a very small area because there is no base-running.
Individual sports.
St. Louis was also home to four prominent twentieth-century boxers, Sonny Liston, Henry Armstrong, and brothers Leon and Michael Spinks. The two are the only brothers in boxing history to have both captured the Heavyweight boxing title. Leon's son Cory Spinks has also held a world title.
Gateway International Raceway hosts NHRA Drag Racing and NASCAR racing events east of the city in Madison, Illinois.
College sports.
Saint Louis University (SLU) plays NCAA Division I sports as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. SLU dropped football as an intercollegiate sport in 1949, but SLU is best known for its men's basketball and men's soccer programs. SLU men's soccer led the NCAA in average attendance in 1999, 2001, and 2003, drawing over 2,700 fans per match each season. In 2006, the College Cup was played at Hermann Stadium on the campus of Saint Louis University.
The main campus of Lindenwood University, located in the suburb of St. Charles, also fields a number of sports teams, most of them in the NCAA Division II Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association. Three Lindenwood programs compete as effective Division I members in sports that have no Division II national championship. The women's ice hockey team competes in College Hockey America, the women's gymnastics team competes in the Midwest Independent Conference, and the men's volleyball team plays in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. Lindenwood's rugby program, despite having started only in 2011, is one the top ranked rugby programs in the country.

Mishka

Mishka (born Alexander Mishka Frith, 1974) is an internationally known reggae artist from Bermuda. He released his first self-titled album "Mishka" in 1999 and had a hit single in the UK with "Give You All The Love". He is currently signed to Jimmy Buffetts record label, Mailboat records, and is touring in support of his latest album, 'Ocean is my Potion'. He is also the face of ECO-Neill, surf-clothing company O'Neill's new eco-friendly apparel line.
Biography.
Mishka Frith had a unique childhood and extraordinary upbringing. Born to a Bermudian father and Nova Scotian mother, he grew up on his family's boat, sailing from island to island in the Caribbean. Mishka and his sisters (one of whom is also a music artist, Heather Nova, the other television news reporter and model Susannah Frith) were home schooled until their high school years. His uncle, Michael K. Frith, worked for The Jim Henson Company, and was a creator of Miss Piggy, and of the television shows Fraggle Rock and Between the Lions. His son, Mishka's first-cousin, is folk singer Jonathan Frith. In addition to developing his skills as a musician, Mishka also spent countless hours honing his windsurfing talents. He represented Bermuda in 1991 and 1992 in the windsurfing world championships, before concentrating primarily on his music career.
Mishka was signed to Alan McGee's Creation Records in the UK in 1997. In 1999, Mishka released his first single, "Give You All The Love" which was an immediate success charting in the Top 40 in the UK and Top 10 in Japan. Mishka released his self-titled debut album "Mishka" (including Heather Nova on backing vocals) later that year which received much critical acclaim in both the UK and Japan.
Mishka's second album "One Tree" was produced by Swedish producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, James Morrison) in 2005. On his third album, "Above the Bones", Mishka worked with long time Sly and Robbie guitarist, Daryl Thompson, who played for many years with Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru. It was at this time that Mishka met actor Matthew McConaughey. The two shared a deeply rooted appreciation for reggae music and it was a natural fit for McConaughey to sign Mishka to his j.k. livin record label. In February 2009, "Above the Bones" debuted at number one on the Billboard Reggae Charts, and Mishka was named 2009's Best New Artist in the singer/songwriter category by iTunes.
Mishka released his album, "Talk About", on 30 March 2010. It again debuted at number one on the iTunes Reggae Chart and includes the song "Homegrown" that features Willie Nelson. "Talk About" also features "Stars Will Be Shining" and "Give Them Love", produced by Butch Walker (Pete Yorn, P!nk, Fall Out Boy).
Mishka began actively touring in support of "Talk About" in the spring of 2010. At the same time, Mishka and surf-clothing giant, O'Neill, entered into a relationship. O'Neill, the original California surf, snow and lifestyle brand, manufactures westsuits, drysuits, sports clothing and accessories and is currently developing an eco-friendly apparel line, "ECO-Neill", which Mishka will have a hand in designing.
In 2012 Mishka released his EP album "Ocean Is My Potion" on Mailboat Records, featuring his long-time friend and legendary musician Jimmy Buffett and cover album artwork by surf genre fine artist Jay Alders.
His album "The Journey", released in November 2013, topped the Billboard Reggae Albums chart in January 2014, his fifth album to achieve that position.

Chand Ke Paar Chalo (TV series)

Chand Ke Paar Chalo is a daily soap starring Yami Gautam that aired on NDTV Imagine every Monday to Thursday at 10.30 pm.
Plot.
"Chand Ke Paar Chalo" starts with Anisa, a happy-go-lucky, lower middle class Muslim girl living in Lucknow with her parents. Initially, the story depicts Anisa's life in college, where she struggles to make a place for herself among the rich and well-connected students. She falls in love with a handsome and aristocratic young man, but backs off when she learns about his love for another girl. Selflessly, Anisa helps him to win the heart of his lady love. 
Then Anisa and her parents migrate to Mumbai. They go there primarily because Anisa’s father requires treatment and the big city will provide better facilities. Anisa wants to get a job. She feels that opportunities in Mumbai are far greater than in Lucknow, and she doesn’t want her ill and weak father to have to struggle to provide for them in Lucknow. For her, Lucknow does not hold any charm.
Anisa, after much struggle, procures a job in one of Mumbai’s biggest media houses — The Singhanias — who are the owners of a popular magazine: "Desi Girls". She is hired by Arjun Singhania, the head honcho of this business empire, as his younger brother Rahul’s personal assistant.
Arjun is tired of Rahul’s philandering ways, which are likely to ruin a big merger he is planning with Rahul’s fiancée's family. Arjun is convinced that Anisa is exactly the kind of girl whom Rahul will never dream of flirting with. Rahul, on the other hand, is appalled that he is saddled with a girl like Anisa, who, for him, is a social embarrassment.
The story now is of Anisa trying to fit into this new world of glitz and glamour: a world where every girl is a size zero, where every man is flirtatious, where money talks and style defines one's worth. Anisa is thrown into a world where everyone looks down on her and treats her with disdain. It is the story of her struggle to make a place for herself and find happiness, love, and a unique identity.
Characters.
Anisa.
The girl is effervescent, gregarious, funny and uninhibited. She is from a lower middle-class family. Not the sati-savitri types, she often speaks her mind. She firmly believes in living in the moment. Her spontaneity sometimes brings about clumsiness and disorganization. She is not interested in studying as she is dying to get married and have kids. She tries to drop out of university any chance she gets. However, her mother keeps sending her back to school.
Arjun.
The head honcho of this great business of magazines and newspapers, Arjun is heading this media empire since his father died less than half a year ago. He had to shoulder the weight of the whole business. He saw the empire totally go to the dogs when his father died; everyone tried to take advantage of his naiveté. He does not want to see himself, his family name or business again in that vulnerable spot and is therefore highly protective of his brother. So he has arranged his brother’s marriage with a girl from an extremely influential family. He thinks that money is the only steadfast thing in this cut throat business world; love has absolutely no space in his life.
Rahul.
A Casanova and cad who has been protectively brought up by his elder brother and has not really seen the hard side of life thanks to his entire family who had babied him. He is not really serious about anything. Relationships to him are always casual. His mother is always pushing him to take more interest in work, and he is always turning a deaf ear to her pleas. He is engaged to Vanshika Mittal but thinks that it is a challenge to cheat beyond this relationship. He is looking to postpone marriage for as long as he can. Having affairs galore, he thinks it is a challenge to bed every girl he comes across. He is used to the best things of life and is not willing to grow up and get a mature grip of life. It is only when he thinks Anisa is a challenge and he finds her interesting does he mature for her sake.

List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses

The Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses was the presiding officer of the House of Burgesses, the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly during the period in which Virginia was a colony of the Kingdom of England and, after 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain.
The General Assembly itself was first organized in 1619, when the colony was owned and administered by the London Company. Twenty-two burgesses were elected to that Assembly, two each from eleven designated settlement areas in the colony. The Assembly formed a unicameral legislature made up of the burgesses and the appointed members of the Governor's Council, presided over by the Governor, George Yeardley. Yeardley designated his secretary, John Pory, a council member, as Speaker of the General Assembly. Pory, however, appears to have acted only as secretary of the Assembly.
The General (or Grand) Assembly met seventeen more times from that first session through 1642. Its legal standing was put in doubt when the London Company was dissolved in May 1624 and Virginia came under the direct administration of the Crown.
A crisis developed in the spring of 1635 when an unpopular governor, Sir John Harvey, was arrested and deported to England by his own Council. This led to the February 1639 reappointment of former Governor Sir Francis Wyatt. Wyatt's instructions acknowledged the legal status of the General Assembly and of land titles granted by the London Company, ending 15 years of legal limbo.
In late 1642 Sir William Berkeley was appointed Governor. He reorganized the Assembly into two houses along the lines of the English Parliament. The new lower house, the House of Burgesses, was to provide a counterweight to the Council-led group that had deposed Harvey. However, they maneuvered to elect one of their own, Thomas Stegg, as the first Speaker of the new House when it convened in March 1643.

The Trouble with Normal (book)

The Trouble with Normal: Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life is a book by Michael Warner that discusses the role of same-sex marriage as a goal for gay rights activists. First published in 1999 by The Free Press, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, it was re-published in 2000 in paperback by Harvard University Press. Warner argues that the right to marry is an inadequate and ultimately undesirable goal for gay rights activism. As well as addressing marriage, he considers other areas in which public discourse stigmatizes certain sexual behaviors, including through sensationalist coverage of sex scandals, public zoning initiatives that marginalize the sex industry, and the attempted use of shame to manage sexually transmitted disease. The book has been described as a classic of the debates on normalcy as a goal for the gay rights movement, and as an important contribution to queer theory.
Overview.
"The Trouble with Normal" argues that same-sex marriage should not be the sole goal for gay rights activism; that gay activists should work toward equal benefits for domestic partners and unconventional families. When national LGBT activists insist on the overriding importance of marriage, the book argues, it stigmatizes queer people who choose other types of relationships, while ignoring a broad range of legal benefits that could help the entire community, not just legally married couples. Criticizing those who present gay marriage and the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy as the sole remaining aims of the (American) gay rights movement, Warner contends that the institutional sanctioning of certain types of relationship always comes at the expense of others, which are constituted by contrast as abnormal, inferior, and shameful. He argues that any queer rights movement would do better to abandon the pursuit of normality in favour of campaigning for the recognition of broader varieties of sexual expression as dignified. He discusses the part played by the idea of normality in the uneven distribution of sexual shame that inhibits lives, and the negative consequences — including greater risk of violence and disease — that result.
Synopsis.
Chapter One, "The Ethics of Sexual Shame", criticizes the idea that there is some morally compelling aspect to "normality", arguing that the normal range is simply a statistical category to which there is no ethical obligation to correspond: "If normal just means within a common statistical range, there is no reason to be normal or not" (see also Hume's Guillotine). Warner uses the example of former US president Bill Clinton's impeachment after a sexual scandal to argue that public and political discourse uses shame disingenuously, to portray certain kinds of sexual behaviour as intolerable, when private morality generally recognises the compatibility of sex with dignity.
The second chapter, titled "What's Wrong with Normal?", argues that as well as being a limited goal, less urgent than the elimination of violence and discrimination against queer people, same-sex marriage actively causes negative consequences both for queer and straight people, because in validating a single, prescribed type of relationship it devalues and makes more difficult other kinds of interpersonal relationship. Warner argues that the campaign for gay marriage threatens to turn the gay rights movement, previously a powerful force against the stigmatization of sex, into a tool for the normalization of queer life. 
In Chapter Three, "Beyond Gay Marriage", Warner proposes that by restricting its campaigning to demands for same-sex marriage, the gay rights movement has marginalized and ignored queer counterpublics that it would have served better by presenting a broad range of sexual lives as moral. 
In the fourth chapter, "Zoning Out Sex", Warner examines the history of zoning regulation changes in 1990s New York City. He argues that stricter regulation of the city's sex-related businesses represents a trend toward the repression of sex and the "erosion of queer publics." By removing problematic, visible, queer sex from public spaces, Warner argues, these policies relegated sexuality to a private sphere of presumed heterosexuality. The net effect was to heighten hypocrisy over the conduct of sexual relationships, supporting the impression that the best any sexuality campaigner can aspire to is admission to a limited sphere of normality that is politically sanctioned, but also deliberately placed outside the sphere of the politically debatable.
In the final chapter, "The Politics of Shame and HIV Prevention", Warner challenges the assertion, made by gay authors like Larry Kramer, that sexual recklessness is to blame for continuing cases of HIV infection. Warner argues that, on the contrary, the political use of shame to stigmatize certain kinds of sexual activity actually puts more people at risk of contracting HIV and developing AIDS, by marginalizing those in at-risk communities and restricting access to condoms and safer sex advice. He also criticizes abstinence-only sex education as "an appalling insult to gay men and lesbians among others" and an inadequate response to the problems of public sexual health, asserting that "shame and stigma are often among the most intractable dimensions of risk."
Commercial and critical reception.
As the "Library Journal" noted, "The Trouble With Normal" was sometimes construed as a straightforward response to Andrew Sullivan's 1995 "". David Bell, in "Contemporary Sociology", accordingly characterized "The Trouble with Normal" as a move in the "assimilationist debates", over the extent to which gay people should aspire to 'normality', that characterized 1990s and 2000s gay rights activism. In these debates Warner was ranged against Andrew Sullivan and Larry Kramer, who argued that the most radical goals the movement could seek were the acceptance of gay life into the political and cultural mainstream, through rights like marriage. Warner insisted that, on the contrary, queer people were ideally positioned to critique and challenge mainstream institutions and should not settle for mere tolerance. The debate was impassioned; Warner told the "Guardian" that "This Fifties version of how gay life should be that we've been handed is actually not making a lot of people happy", while Sullivan asked "What could be more boring than to still be referring to yourself as "queer"?" In 2003 the "Library Journal" described Warner's book as a classic in the field of the debate on normalcy.
Queer theorist Judith Butler, with whose idea of the necessarily transgressive nature of queerness Warner takes issue, called the book "brave and timely", applauding its analysis of sexual shame and noting that "one may not concur with every word, but everyone will attest to the power and necessity of the invaluable critical voice offered here." Martha Nussbaum, writing in the "New Republic", praised the book's moral opposition to "the domination of the 'normal': "Warner is a deft and thoughtful writer who turns his own experience of the margins into a source of genuine understanding about America and its sexual politics...what Warner's book finally demands of us is...genuine reflection." Nussbaum later called the book "clearly written and argued, insightful about human life, and valuable both in its theoretical analysis and its recommendations for practice."
"Kirkus Reviews" praised the "lapidary skill" with which the book criticized heteronormativity, but objected to its emphasis on the need for an already marginalized gay community to change: "Telling gay people that, for various ethical reasons, they shouldn't even want to marry, when they already can't, does not change the fact that laws that enfranchise some while disenfranchising others are discriminatory. Warner's rhetoric persuasively reveals the hierarchical parameters of marriage and the constraints of normalcy, but a more universal approach to his topic would delineate the limitations of marriage for all people, not just queer people. In the end, his polemic leaves standing discriminatory treatment of queers for the sake of a theoretical attack on normalcy."
Release details.
"Publishers Weekly" noted that, though "The Trouble with Normal" engaged with a broad social context through its analysis of the Clinton affair, the degree to which Warner criticized the positions of gay advocates Kramer, Michelangelo Signorile, and William Eskridge "positions his arguments as an intra-community fight and may limit his readership." The "Library Journal" recommended the book as a "provocative polemic" for "specialized collections" The "New York Times" characterized Warner as one of the Free Press's "contrarian" writers, quoting editorial director Elizabeth Macguire as noting that the book's anti-mainstream message had not been universally popular at the publishing house, but insisting that "If you don't embrace a book, really believe you produced with the author a good book, it doesn't work. That doesn't have much to do with ideology."

Gary Cooper filmography

This Gary Cooper filmography chronicles his 36 years as a motion picture actor. Cooper started working in the movie industry in 1925, originally as a film extra. He made his official cinematic debut the following year in the Samuel Goldwyn production "The Winning of Barbara Worth." He went on to become a contract player with Paramount Pictures where he established himself as a popular leading man prior to the end of the silent era.
Cooper's future in the sound era was assured with the release of "The Virginian" (1929), his first all-talkie film. For the next 32 years, he would be one of cinema's top money-making stars. From 1936 to 1957, Cooper ranked 18 times among the top ten box office attractions—a record when he died in 1961, and later surpassed only by John Wayne, who ranked among the top ten 25 times, Clint Eastwood (21 times) and Tom Cruise (20 times).
Cooper was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award five times and won twice, for "Sergeant York" (1942) and "High Noon" (1952). The latter film boosted his popularity, resulting in him being the number one box office attraction in 1953. Cooper received a third Academy Award—an honorary one—just prior to his death in 1961. His final film, "The Naked Edge", was released shortly after his death.
As of February 2008, more than half of Gary Cooper's feature films are available on DVD, while others not yet on home video are available for television broadcast. Unfortunately, at least two of his silent films—"Beau Sabreur" (1928) and "The Legion of the Condemned" (1928),—are now considered lost films. Another of his silent films, "Wolf Song" (1929), was originally released as a part talkie, but survives only as a silent film. One of Cooper's earliest talkies, "Paramount on Parade" (1930), survives incomplete. The prints that are available for television are missing all but one of the film's Technicolor scenes—a partial restoration of these scenes was done by the UCLA Film Archives.
This filmography contains sections for Cooper's work as an extra in the earliest part of his film career, his feature film appearances, his occasional appearances in short films, and a section for a compilation film. Due to its length (92 films), the listing of his feature films is divided in four sections. Cooper's film roles are listed, as well as the names of each film's director and co-stars. Cooper's awards and nominations are also listed. Except where noted, all of his films were shot in 35mm black and white. All films released prior to "Lilac Time" (1928) are silent films and all from "The Virginian" (1929) onward are sound films. The films made during the silent-to-sound transition are noted as being either silent or sound films. As an addendum, Cooper's handful of television appearances are also listed.

K-factor (marketing)

In viral marketing, the K-factor can be used to describe the growth rate of websites, apps, or a customer base. The formula is roughly as follows:
This usage is borrowed from the medical field of epidemiology in which a virus having a k-factor of 1 is in a "steady" state of neither growth nor decline, while a k-factor greater than 1 indicates exponential growth and a k-factor less than 1 indicates exponential decline. The k-factor in this context is itself a product of the rates of distribution and infection for an app (or virus). "Distribution" measures the average number of people a host will contact while still infectious, and "infection" measures how likely an average person is to also become infected after contact with a viral host.

Tom Watkins (American football)

Tom Watkins (October 23, 1937 – October 29, 2011) was an American football running back in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 15th round of the 1960 NFL Draft. He played college football at Iowa State.
Watkins also played for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers. He was inducted into Iowa State's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to George Plimpton's best-selling book "Paper Lion" Watkins, graduated from Iowa State University in 1961, was one of the best running backs in Cyclone history. A member of the famed 1959 "Dirty Thirty" team, Watkins ranked second in the nation in rushing that season and earned All-America honors the following year in 1960. He played seven seasons in the NFL, leading the league in punt return yardage as a Lion in 1963 and 1964. He was inducted into ISU's Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002.

Joan Waste

Joan Waste (1534 – 1 August 1556) was a blind woman who was burned in Derby for refusing to renounce her Protestant faith.
Biography.
Waste was born blind in 1534, with her twin brother Roger, to a Derby barber, William Waste and his wife, Joan. By the age of twelve she had learned to knit as well as how to make ropes (her father was also a ropemaker). 
In 1553, Queen Mary I came to the throne and in January 1555 it was made illegal by Parliament to hold Protestant views. At least 284 people were condemned for heresy during Mary's reign. Some were famous, the bishops Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley among them, but many executed between spring 1555 and the queen's death in November 1558 were from "the lower orders".
Waste was called before the Catholic Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Ralph Baines' chancellor, Anthony Draycot, to defend her views; and for these she was condemned. She had objected to the services now being read in Latin. She was sentenced for buying a New Testament which she asked friends to read to her for a penny a time. She also denied the doctrine of transubstantiation and held that the bread and wine were only that.
On the day of her death she was reported to have held hands with her twin brother as she walked to her death. 
Waste was accompanied to church by Anthony Draycot who gave a final sermon, Thomas Powthread, Sir John Port, Henry Vernon and Master John Dethick of Newhall.
The public execution took place at Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. Windmill Hill Pit is on Lime Avenue which is just off Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope and she fell into the fire when the rope burned through. Waste was expected to suffer for her beliefs for eternity. Draycot it is said went home to his meal that day.
There is a memorial to her in Birchover church. The place where Waste was executed is now the site of a Roman Catholic church. Ralph Baines, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield was deprived of his bishopric (21 June 1559) on the accession of Elizabeth I of England and committed to the imprisonment of Edmund Grindal, the Protestant Bishop of London. Draycot was sent to be a prisoner of the fleet and died after being released in 1571.

<doc id="21565017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21565017" title="Speed limiter">
Speed limiter

A speed limiter is a governor used to limit the top speed of a vehicle. For some classes of vehicle and in some jurisdictions they are a statutory requirement, for some other vehicles the manufacturer provides a non-statutory system which may be fixed or programmable by the driver.
Statutory (UK).
Mopeds.
The legal definition of a Moped in the United Kingdom was revised in 1977 to include a maximum design speed of 30 mph (48 km/h). This was further revised to 50 km/h (31 mph) in the 1990s, then 45 km/h (28 mph) in the late 2000s to fall in line with unified European Union licensing regulations.
To comply with this, mopeds typically include some method of onboard speed restriction to prevent the machine exceeding the prescribed speed (on a flat road, in still air, with a rider of standard height and weight). Older models such as the Honda C50 used a simple centrifugal governor as part of the transmission, which progressively and severely advanced the ignition as speed rose past a set point, causing engine power to fall off rapidly at higher rpm and road speed, but maintaining the low- and moderate-speed hill climbing ability of the unrestricted version. Other systems achieved a similar result with simple restrictor flaps in the air intake, much like those used to restrict the power output of full-size motorcycles. Modern mopeds use electronic systems with speed sensors that can cut the ignition spark (and, where fitted, interrupt fuel injection) once measured speed reaches or exceeds the set point, maintaining full power right up to the limited speed.
Early restriction methods could be defeated by simple physical modifications (e.g. cutting out the restriction plate). Modern electronic limiters at the very least require replacing the friction rollers in a scooter's CVT transmission, or even changing wheel size and/or reprogramming the engine management system, all in an effort to fool the sensors into detecting a lower than actual road speed.
Public services vehicles.
Public service vehicles often have a legislated top speed. Scheduled coach services in the United kingdom (and also bus services) are limited to either 65 mph or 100 km/h (62 mph) depending on their age (newer coaches have the lower speed version installed, in line with harmonised EU regulations), though for city buses the use of limiters is to satisfy regulatory requirements, as many city buses cannot achieve these speeds even on an open roadway.
Heavy goods vehicles.
HGVs in the UK have been subject to mandatory 60 mph (97 km/h) limiters since the early 1990s, which was subsequently revised to 56 mph (90 km/h) during EU harmonisation. Certain classes of heavy truck are subject to a further reduced 53 mph (85 km/h) limiter.
Non-statutory.
Programmable.
Many Citroën,
Mercedes Benz,
Peugeot,
Renault as well as some Ford car and van models have driver-controlled speed limiters fitted or available as an optional accessory which can be set by the driver to any desired speed; the limiter can be overridden if required by pressing hard on the accelerator.
The limiter may be considered as setting the maximum speed (with throttle kickdown to override it) easing the throttle to reduce speed, whereas cruise control sets the minimum speed (with the brake pedal to override it) pressing on the throttle to increase speed. The limiter may shift down through automatic gears to hold the maximum speed.
Fixed.
In European markets, General Motors Europe sometimes allow certain high-powered Opel or Vauxhall cars to exceed the mark, whereas their Cadillacs do not. The Chrysler 300C SRT8 is limited to 270 km/h. Most Japanese domestic market vehicles are limited to only or .
BMW and Mercedes will 'unhook' their speed limited cars in Europe and Mercedes will provide some vehicles in the USA without limiters for an additional price. There are also third-party companies who will re-flash vehicle computers with new software which will remove the speed limits and improve overall performance.
Many small and medium sized commercial vehicles are now routinely fitted with speed limiters as a manufacturer option, with a mind towards reducing fuel bills, maintenance costs and insurance premiums, as well as discouraging employees from abusing company vehicles, attracting speeding fines and attracting bad publicity. These limiters are set somewhat lower than for sports cars, typically at 56, 62, 68 or 70 mph (90, 100, 110 or 113 km/h) in the UK, with options for 75 and 81 mph (120 and 130 km/h) listed in countries where these speeds are legal. Often the fitting of a limiter is combined with a small warning sticker on the rear of the vehicle, stating its maximum speed, to discourage drivers who may themselves be delayed by having to follow it from tailgating or other aggressive driving intended to intimidate the lead driver into accelerating.
Similarly, most electric cars and vans which are not inherently limited by a low power output or "short" gearing tend to implement a maximum speed cap via their power controllers, to prevent the rapid loss of battery charge and corresponding reduction in range caused by the much greater power demands of high speeds; for example, the Smart ED, Nissan Leaf, Mitsubishi MiEV, and the Citroen Berlingo EV. The limits are typically in line with those of other deliberately limited vehicles, for a balance that does not overly compromise either range or travel time; e.g. 90 km/h for the Berlingo, 100~120 km/h for the Smart (depending on version). The Leaf is an unusual case, being instead limited to a much higher 145 km/h (90 mph).
Some small economy cars feature limiters, because of stability and other safety concerns (short crumple zones, etc.), and to safeguard their small engines from the prolonged overrevving required to produce the power to achieve higher speeds. The first generation Smart was limited to 135 km/h (84 mph) (later generations were unlimited), and the Mitsubishi i to 130 km/h (81 mph).
Some heavy goods vehicle operators (typically big-name retailers, rather than haulage contractors) further reduce their HGV limiters from 90 km/h to a lower speed, typically 85 or 80 km/h (53 or 50 mph), in a claimed bid to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. This is again often highlighted by a warning sticker on the truck's tailgate.

<doc id="21565162" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21565162" title="Chinese American literature">
Chinese American literature

Chinese American literature is the body of literature produced in the United States by writers of Chinese descent. The genre began in the 19th century and flowered in the 20th with such authors as Sui Sin Far, Frank Chin, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Amy Tan.
Characteristics and themes.
Chinese American literature deals with many topics and themes. A common topic is the challenges, both inner and outer, of assimilation in mainstream, white American society by Chinese Americans. Another common theme is that of interaction between generations, particularly older, Chinese-born and younger, American-born generations. Questions of identity and gender are often dealt with as well.
History.
19th-century Chinese American literature.
19th-century Chinese American literature has only recently come to be studied, as much of it was written in Chinese. These Chinese-language writings of Chinese Americans immigrants have only recently been made available.
19th-century Chinese American writers were primarily workers and students. These early Chinese American authors produced autobiographies as well as novels and poems, mostly in Cantonese. Many wrote in both English and Chinese, sometimes exploring similar themes in each language, sometimes translating their own works from language into the other. Tone as well as content differed, as Chinese American writers in English dealt with rampant stereotypes of the Yellow Peril.
Among these early writers was Yung Wing, the first Chinese student to graduate from an American University (Yale, in 1854), whose autobiography, "My Life in China and America", was published in 1909.
20th-century Chinese American literature.
Chinese American literature written of the 20th century is written almost exclusively in English. Edith Maude Eaton, writing as Sui Sin Far, was one of the first Chinese American authors to publish fiction in English, although her works, first published in the teens, were not re-discovered and re-printed until 1995. In the 1930s, Lin Yutang's "My Country and My People" (1935), and "The Importance of Living" (1937), became best-sellers. 
Chinese American authors became more prolific and accepted after the lifting of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Authors who achieved success in the 1950s included C.Y. Lee (author), whose "The Flower Drum Song" was made into a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, and Jade Snow Wong, author of Fifth Chinese Daughter.
The 1970s saw further progress. Playwright Frank Chin's play, "The Chickencoop Chinaman" (1971) became the first play by an Asian American to be produced as a major New York production. Maxine Hong Kingston won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976 for The Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Childhood among Ghosts. 
In the 1980s, David Henry Hwang won the Obie award for his play, "FOB", as well as a Tony Award for Best Play for his "M. Butterfly". Bette Bao Lord's "Spring Moon" (1981) became an international bestseller and an American Book Award nominee. Amy Tan's "The Joy Luck Club" was published to immediate popularity and wide, though not universal, acclaim. The book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over forty weeks, and won the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the Commonwealth Gold Award. "The Joy Luck Club" was produced as a major motion picture in 1993 and was nominated for Best Picture.
The 1990s saw further growth, as David Wong Louie received acclaim for his short story collection, "Pangs of Love", and Eric Liu collected memoirs and essays in "The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker" (1997).
Recent history.
Currently active and acclaimed Chinese American authors are Gish Jen, Jean Kwok, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, and Sandra Tsing Loh. Shawn Wong's novel "American Knees", published in 1996, was adapted into an independent feature film entitled "Americanese" in 2009.
Chinese American criticism.
Frank Chin and others have been vocal critics of popular Chinese American authors, particularly Chinese American women authors, such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan. Chin argues that Tan and others paint a world in which Chinese Americans must repudiate "the icky-gooey evil of Chinese culture". Others have criticized Chinese American women authors for criticizing sexism in Chinese culture; in so doing, critics argue, these women are participating in the "racial castration" of Chinese and Asian American men, who are already "materially and psychically feminized" by mainstream, white American culture.
Some of these criticisms are fueled by anger over the way in which female Chinese American authors have portrayed the sexism and patriarchy of Imperial China, ways which male critics feel are sometimes unfair. For example, Maxine Hong Kingston has been criticized for her claim in The Woman Warrior that, in Chinese, the character for "woman" is also the character for "slave." Critics of Kingston claim that while 奴 (slave) contains 女 (woman), it is only as a radical to indicate the pronunciation of the character; however, this, while true, does not address the questions of why the spoken words for slave and woman should sound so similar, and if that similarity could have its origins in a patriarchal society. On the other hand, there are other words that sound strangely similar, such as 死 (death) and 四 (four,) and, of course, there are other words that also sound and look similar, yet possess completely different meanings. However, it should be noted that words with similar sounds are sometimes associated with one another, like how four is associated with death.

List of military units of Clark Air Base

Military units of Clark Air Base consisted primarily of United States Army and United States Air Force organizations.
Major commands.
Clark Air Base was assigned to the following major commands:
Note: *Clark Field was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army between 20 December 1941 – 10 February 1945.
Major units assigned.
Cold War (1950–1991).
.* Performed Host Unit Mission
Military units before WWII.
Clark Air Base was originally established as Fort Stotsenburg in Sapang Bato, Angeles in 1903 under control of the U.S. Army. Officers' quarters and water system constructed 1910–1911 and a flying school was created in 1912. Construction of steel hangars and a dirt air strip 1917–1918; a portion of Ft Stotsenburg officially set aside for the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and named Clark Fld, September 1919.
The 3d Aero Squadron was assigned to Clark Field in December 1919 and for the next decade functioned as an observer training unit flying a wide variety of mono and biplanes.
In 1922, the 28th Squadron (Bomb) was assigned as a defense force for the Philippines.
Clark served as a landing field for medium bombers and accommodated half of the heavy bombers stationed in the Philippines during the 1930s. In the late summer and fall of 1941, many aircraft were sent to Clark in anticipation of war with Imperial Japan. Six B-17Cs and 29 B-17Ds were serving with the 19th Bombardment Group based at Clark The 14th Bomb Squadron of the 19th Bombardment Group had been transferred to the Philippines in September 1941 in a spectacular trans-Pacific flight to Clark Field, and two more squadrons had flown to Clark in October.
Military units during WWII.
Clark and its subordinate airfield at Del Monte were the only airfields in the Philippines capable of heavy bomber operations at the outbreak of World War II.
News of the Pearl Harbor attack was received at about 3 am on 8 December in the Philippines. According to the previously-agreed upon plan, if hostilities were to break out, an attack on Japanese bases in Formosa was to be immediately carried out by the 19th Bombardment Group's Fortresses. On 8 December, there were 35 USAAC B-17s in the Philippines, with two squadrons at Clark Field on Luzon with a total of 19 planes, and two squadrons at Del Monte on Mindanao 500 miles to the south with the other 16 B-17s.
For reasons which are still unclear even today, the planned raid on Formosa was delayed. Instead, in order to prevent them from being destroyed on the ground by a Japanese air attack, all flyable B-17s based at Clark Field had been ordered into the air and to patrol the waters around Luzon. In the meantime, General Lewis H. Brereton, General MacArthur's air commander, finally got approval to carry out the strike against Japanese bases on Formosa, and the B-17s were recalled to Clark. When the Fortresses returned to Clark, three of them were equipped with cameras for reconnaissance and the remainder were loaded up with 100-lb and 300-lb bombs in preparation for the planned mission to Formosa.
The three reconnaissance B-17s were taxiing out for the initial photographic mission to Formosa when about 200 Japanese aircraft struck. Unfortunately, all the P-40 fighters had been recalled for refuelling and were on the ground. . At the end of the day's action it was apparent that the Japanese had won a major victory. The effective striking power of Far East AF had been destroyed, the fighter strength had been seriously reduced, most B-17 maintenance facilities were demolished, and about 80 men were killed. The sole surviving B-17 had not taken off on the morning alert, and had been taken up in the air while the rest were being prepared for the Formosa raid. The Fortresses at Del Monte 500 miles to the south were out of range of the Zeros from Formosa and were left untouched.
At Clark Field, three or four of the damaged B-17s were put back into service. They were joined by the B-17s from Del Monte. By 9 December, reconnaissance missions were being undertaken by the 19th Bombardment Group in search of the Japanese fleet. Also, the 17th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor), 24th Pursuit Group (Interceptor), based at Nichols Field were transferred to Clark with P-40's.
On 10 December, a Japanese convoy was spotted, and five B-17s were dispatched. This was the first American bombardment mission of World War II. No fighter opposition was encountered, and some hits were recorded on the transports.
That same day, a B-17C piloted by Captain Colin P. Kelly dropped bombs from high altitude on what the crew thought to be a Japanese battleship. Hits were recorded, and a tremendous explosion was observed. Kelly's plane was immediately pounced upon by Zeros, one of which was flown by Saburo Sakai, who was later to become a famous ace. Kelly guided his heavily-damaged plane back towards Clark Field. He ordered the crew to parachute to safety, but before Kelly himself could leave, the aircraft exploded and Kelly was killed.
When the surviving crew was questioned, the report was flashed out that they had sunk the Japanese battleship Haruna, and the mission was hailed as a great victory. Captain Kelly was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by President Franklin Roosevelt for his heroism, and was written up in glowing press reports. However, information revealed in the immediate postwar years revealed that the Haruna was nowhere near the area at that time and that the ship most likely struck was the cruiser Ashigari, and it was only fairly lightly damaged by the attack.
On 12 December, about 100 Japanese aircraft again hit Clark. The airfield is severely damaged and plans were made to evacuate the facility. On the 19th, the air echelon of the 93d Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) were transferred from Clark to Batchelor Field near Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia with B-17's. The ground echelon is attached to the 5th Interceptor Command (Provisional) and sent to fight as infantry on Luzon and Mindanao Islands. On Christmas Eve, HQ 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) and the air echelon of the 28th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) were transferred from Clark to Batchelor Field with B-17's. The ground echelon of the 28th were dispatched to fight as infantry on Luzon and Mindanao.
The remaining aircraft and personnel at Clark were evacuated to Australia by 31 December 1941. The base was overrun by Japanese forces less than a week later in early January 1942.
Japanese occupation.
During the period of Japanese occupation, Clark was known as Mabalacat Airfield, and several auxiliary airfields constructed and used. Lilly Hill, located near the center of the base (15*11'35.96"N 120*32'05.14"E), was excavated to allow tunnels to be built into its sides for the storage of fuel and munitions in an attempt to protect them from air raids. After the war Lilly Hill (named for the Papanga word for lonely) was so dangerous, because of the large number of unexploded bombs, the jungle was allowed to over take the hill for a decade. When it was finally reclaimed at least one Japanese fighter aircraft was found to have crashed there. The Japanese also dug tunnels and built stone revetments in the ridge line at the north side of Clark(15*13'03.83"N 120*32'05.14"E). The Americans later built their Northern bomb storage facility at the east end of the ridge, the horse stables on the southern side, the rifle range to the north, and the "Elephant cage" to the west.
Japan|
The airfield was fortified with several Type 88 75 mm AA Guns. Several USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers flying over Clark were shot down by these weapons.
With the surrender of Bataan and the infamous Bataan Death March in April 1942, American and Filipino prisoners were marched past the main gate of the airfield.
In late 1944, with the tide of the war turning against the Japanese, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting at Mabalacat, on 19 October 1944, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group headquarters: that he believed the only way to retain control of the Philippines was to put 250-kg bombs on Zero fighter planes and crash them into U.S. carriers, to wreak havoc on the U.S. Fleet and disable them for weeks.
Commanded by Ōnishi, the first Kamikaze missions were launched from the occupied Clark Air Base. The first volunteers were 23 pilots of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 201st Kōkūtai, 1st Air Fleet. These were divided into four separate groups: Shikishima, Yamato, Asahi and the Yama Yukio Seki units.
At 07:25 on 25 October 1944, the Shikishima unit departed Clark led by Lieutenant Yokjo Seki. At 10:45 am they attacked U.S. ships stationed at Leyte Island, Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Five Zeros, led by Seki, and escorted to the target by leading Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, attacked several escort carriers. One Zero attempted to hit the bridge of the USS Kitkun Bay but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea. Two others dove at USS Fanshaw Bay but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two ran at the USS White Plains, however one, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attempt on the White Plains and instead banked toward the USS St. Lo, plowing into the flight deck. Its bomb caused fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier.
1945 recapture.
Clark Air Base was recaptured by Americans in January 1945 after three months of fierce fighting. Elements of the Sixth U.S. Army cleared most Japanese from Ft Stotsenburg-Clark Fld area and flying activity commenced on least damaged runway while the field still drew Japanese fire, 25 January 1945; saboteurs and infiltrators sporadically damaged parked aircraft until 10 February 1945.
Clark was used as an operational base for several groups in the closing months of the war in the southwest Pacific. Operational units flying from Clark were:
Military units during the Cold War.
With the end of the war in September 1945, Clark became an immediate dumping ground for aircraft of all types from inactivating fighter and bomber units in the southwest Pacific. Aircraft were flown to Clark and the pilots (along with aircrews and maintenance and support personnel) would get on transports back to the United States for discharge. Many of the aircraft (some almost brand-new) were scrapped although low-hour planes were retained and flown back to the United States storage fields and mothballed.
The 20th Air Force 313th Bombardment Wing with four Boeing B-29 Superfortress (6th, 9th, 504th, 505th) Very Heavy bomb groups was reassigned from North Field, Tinian on 13 March 1946. Between 1946 and 15 June 1948, all of these groups were reassigned or inactivated:
On 14 March 1947, the U.S. and the Philippines signed the Military Bases Agreement which provided for use of Clark Air Base until the year 2046 (later amended by the 1966 Rusk-Ramos agreement to 1991).
The 18th Fighter Group was assigned to Clark on 16 September 1947. The 18th was the major Far East Air Force unit in the Philippines in the immediate postwar years, flying a mixture of fighter (P/F-47, P/F-51, F-80), and reconnaissance (RB-29, RB-17G) aircraft. The 18th Flew patrols and trained with Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars, with the distinction of being the first overseas fighter unit to be jet-equipped. On 20 January 1950, the wing was re-designated the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. As a result of the Korean War, the 18th was reassigned from Clark to Pusan AB, South Korea on 1 December 1950.
During the Korean War, the 6204th Photo Mapping Squadron was deployed for three months in 1950 performing aerial mapping of both North and South Korea before being replaced. The unit flew adapted Boeing B-17s (as RB-17Gs) for photographic mapping by having its bombing equipment deleted and replaced by photographic equipment. Some cameras were installed in the nose and in the aft fuselage as well.
During the Korean War and First Indochina War (1950–1954), the 581st Air Resupply and communications Wing performed psychological warfare and unconventional operations. Conducted limited operations in French Indochina in 1953 with C-119, B-29, C-54, and C-118 aircraft.
During the immediate postwar years and throughout the 1950s, Clark's mission was that of a major supply and maintenance depot for Far East Air Forces (later Pacific Air Forces) along with being a command base with Headquarters, 13th Air Force taking up residence in 1949. 13th Air Force would remain at Clark until its closure in 1991.
The 39th Air Division at Misawa AB, Japan deployed the 26th, and later the 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons to Clark from 1954–1960 flying North American F-86F & F-86D Sabres to provide air defense of the Philippine Islands.
405th Fighter Wing.
A change of mission occurred at Clark with the activation of the 405th Fighter Wing on 4 September 1959, replacing the 6200th Air Base Wing. The mission changed from that of being a support depot and maintenance facility to that of an operational fighter wing.
The mission of the 405th was to provide air defense and offensive fighter operations in the Philippines, Taiwan, and other Far Eastern points. The wing had numerous TDY squadrons attached over its operational lifetime at Clark. The following operational squadrons assigned to the wing were:
During the Vietnam War, the wing provided air defense training for Royal Thai Air Force personnel, from Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand from November 1961 – February 1966. From mid-1962 until the end of the conflict in Southeast Asia, the wing frequently deployed assigned and attached components to bases in Thailand and South Vietnam for air defense and combat operations under operational control of other organizations.
When not so involved, components trained in air defense and other tactical exercises in Taiwan and the Philippines. During July–August 1972, provided extensive flood relief to Philippine areas inundated by monsoon rains. During February–March 1973, provided medical, logistical, and administrative support for former American prisoners of war, on their way to the United States from North Vietnam.
3d Tactical Fighter Wing.
After the end of the Vietnam War, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned to Clark without personnel or equipment from Kunsan AB, South Korea on 16 September 1974, replacing the 405th Fighter Wing which was inactivated in place.
The 3d TFW assumed the mission of the former 405th and provided tactical air defense of the Philippines. It participated in frequent operational exercises and evaluations. Between 5 April and 31 May 1975, the wing used its facilities as a staging area for Operations Baby Lift (evacuation of Vietnamese Orphans from South Vietnam to the United States) and New Life (Evacuation of Vietnamese Adults to the United States for resettlement). Provided PACAF aircrews with realistic training in dissimilar aerial combat and current intelligence on enemy air-to-air capabilities and tactics, 1976–1989.
Operational squadrons of the 3d TFW were:
The 3d Tactical Fighter Wing was placed on non-operational status with the evacuation of Clark in June 1991.
The Wing deployed six F-4Es to Turkey for Operation Desert Storm in early 1991 where they flew some of that aircraft's last combat sorties.
Cope Thunder.
Exercise Cope Thunder was a Pacific Air Forces-sponsored exercise initiated at Clark in 1976 which was devised as a way to give aircrews from across Asia their first taste of warfare. The exercise quickly grew into PACAF’s "premier simulated combat airpower employment exercise."
Tactical Airlift.
Between 1968 and 1989, PACAF, and starting in 1974, Military Airlift Command operated a theater airlift capability from Clark.
The 463d Tactical Airlift Wing rotated C-130 squadrons between Clark and Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. After the war, the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing operated C-130s within the theater, as well as Aeromedical Evacuation flights.

Mark Perrin Lowrey

Mark Perrin Lowrey (December 30, 1828 – February 27, 1885) was a Southern Baptist preacher otherwise known as the "Preacher General". He is known for being a Confederate brigadier general during the Civil War, for his works in the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention, and for founding the Blue Mountain College.
Early life and career.
Mark Perrin Lowrey was born in 1828, in McNairy County, Tennessee, to Adam and Marguerite (Doss) Lowrey. His parents had emigrated to America from England and Ireland, and Lowrey received no formal education. His father was killed in an accident in New Orleans when Lowrey was young. In 1843 he moved with his family to Mississippi, where he became a bricklayer. During the Mexican War Lowrey enlisted as a private in the 2nd Mississippi Volunteers in 1847. Neither he or his regiment ever saw action in the conflict, and Lowrey was mustered out in July 1848. 
After the war with Mexico ended, Lowrey married Sarah R. Holmes in 1849. Beginning in 1853 he became a Southern Baptist preacher, serving primarily around the village of Kossuth, Mississippi. After preaching for eight years the American Civil War broke out and his congregation urged him to join the Confederacy. Lowrey also served as a captain in the Mississippi State Militia in 1861.
Civil War service.
Lowrey entered the Confederate service in 1861 as the colonel of the 4th Mississippi Militia. On December 6, 1861, Lowrey was appointed colonel of the 4th Mississippi Infantry, and on April 3, 1862, he became commander of the 32nd Mississippi Infantry. He fought in and was praised at the Battle of Shiloh, Battle of Perryville, the Kentucky Campaign, and the Battle of Chickamauga. At the Battle of Perryville in October 1862 Lowrey was shot in the left arm but stayed on the battlefield. During the retreat which began the next day he had great difficulty keeping up with the army. He then obtained leave and traveled to his brother's house for safety. After six weeks of recuperation Lowrey joined back with his forces and fought at the Battle of Murfreesboro on January 1, 1863. 
On October 4, 1863 at the age of 35 Mark Lowrey was promoted to a Brigadier General. It was because of his evangelistic ties and preaching that he came to be known as the "Preacher General". In December 1864 during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign an officer saw the flash of an enemy gun and yelled to Lowrey, who quickly lowered himself and the bullet stuck and killed a man behind him. Years of bad health and other reasons caused Lowrey to resign his commission as a brigadier general on March 14, 1865, almost one month before the Confederate forces surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, Lowrey's divisional commander during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, pronounced Lowrey "the bravest man in the Confederate Army."
Postbellum career and death.
After the war Lowrey moved back to Mississippi and focused on his studies. Then in 1873 he founded the Blue Mountain Female Institute which later became known as the Blue Mountain College. Lowrey would also serve as president of the Mississippi Baptist convention from 1868 to 1877. 
Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, to run his railroad near the college. Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad the plan was soon carried out. The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the Blue Mountain College Lowrey became very sick and in 1882 his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak. Then on February 27, 1885, while buying a train ticket at Middleton, Tennessee, he turned, gasped, and fell to the floor dead.
Possible family wealth.
Lowrey lore states that sometime after Mark and Sarah were married an English grandfather of Lowrey's mother Margaret (Doss) Lowrey died leaving a six million dollar fortune to his descendants. Before the arrangements could be made for the family to get the money the Civil War began and the descendants became preoccupied with other matters. At the war's end Lowrey once again tried to claim his share of the English estate left behind by his ancestor, but it was discovered that the papers pertaining to the money and estate were lost or destroyed.

Hume and the Problem of Causation

Hume and the Problem of Causation is a book written by Tom Beauchamp and Alexander Rosenberg, published in 1981 by Oxford University Press. 
Beauchamp and Rosenberg developed a single interpretation of David Hume’s view on the nature of causation that rests on all of his works, and defended it against historical and contemporary objections. They argued in particular that Hume was not a skeptic about induction but sought to undermine a priori justifications of induction advanced by rationalist philosophers.

The Return (short story)

"The Return" is a science fiction short story written by H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire. It is not a part of either Piper’s Terro-Human Future History series or his Paratime series.
It made its first appearance in the January 1954 issue of "Astounding Science Fiction". The story was later edited and expanded for its appearance in the 1960 book, "The Science Fictional Sherlock Holmes". The differences between the two editions of the story are minor, mostly taking the form of added dialogue.
Synopsis.
It has been more than 250 years since the nuclear war devastated the world, and finally the people of Fort Ridgeway (in what had once been Arizona) are advanced enough to go out looking for other surviving communities. The helicopter-borne explorers, Dr. Jim Loudons and Monty Altamont, are on their way to Pittsburgh to dig up an old cache of microfilmed books that was buried at the Carnegie Library before the war. Having so far only encountered stone-age barbarians, they are surprised to find a fort, manned by people with organization, firearms, and literacy.
The people living in the fort are descendants of an old pre-war army platoon, and they have maintained their organization and civilization as much as is possible. Also, they seem to have developed a strange religion around a god who died in battle with his adversary, both of whom were later resurrected. The adversary is behind the primitives who periodically attack the people of the “Toon,” and the Toon waits for their god to come back to them. In the meantime, it is up to them to follow his teachings of deductive reading and keen observation.
Having secured the Toon’s promise to assist them in retrieving the microfilm, Loudons and Altamont realize that they are being judged by the Toon. They seem to think that Monty Altamont is either their long-awaited god, or perhaps his adversary. The fate of their mission, not to mention their very lives might just depend on what the Toon decides.
Loudons and Altamont and eight members of the Toon set out for Pittsburgh aboard their helicopter. After locating the library’s storage crypt, Dr. Loudons returns to the fort in the helicopter to get more workers, while Altamont and the eight Toon members stay behind. The local primitives, called Scowrers, launch an attack, appearing in larger numbers than the Toon has ever seen before. The realization that the adversary wants desperately to destroy the little band convinces the Toon members who Monty Altamont really is.
Having collected the microfilm and set off for Fort Ridgeway, Loudons tells Altamont that he has seen the sacred books of the Toon, and he is now very worried. Just what will happen to the Toon when they realize that they are mistaken, and that Loudons and Altamont are not really Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes?

West Branch Schuylkill River

The West Branch Schuylkill River (also known simply as the West Branch) is an approximately tributary of the Schuylkill River in central Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, USA, with a watershed approximately in size. Several small communities are located in the watershed, which include Buck Run, Glen Dower, Minersville, Pottsville, Cressona, and Schuylkill Haven. Mild amounts of acid mine drainage affect the West Branch and its tributaries. From its headwaters near Interstate 81, the river flows southeast through several water gaps in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, ending at its confluence with the Schuylkill River in Schuylkill Haven. 
Course.
The West Branch's source is several small ponds east of Interstate 81, near the small community of Buck Run. The river flows east-northeast, paralleling Valley Road and later the Heckscherville Road. Near Heckscherville, it receives small tributaries Dyer Run, Wagner Run, and Wheeler Creek, all on the left bank. It then flows south and southeast past Minersville, and finally east through a narrow canyon, where it receives Indian Run on the right bank. After exiting the canyon, it turns south and enters an increasingly wide valley. At Cressona, it receives Panther Creek on the right bank and Beaver Creek on the left bank. As the river enters Schuylkill Haven it merges with the Schuylkill River on the right bank.
