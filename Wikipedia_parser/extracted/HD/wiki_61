St. Cuthbert's Mission, Guyana

St. Cuthbert's Mission (Arawak: Pakuri; also known simply as St. Cuthbert's) is an Amerindian village on the Mahaica River in the Demerara-Mahaica region (Region 4) of Guyana. It comprises approximately 200 households. St. Cuthbert's is regarded by many people in Guyana as the "cultural capital" for Amerindians.
History.
St Cuthbert's Mission was founded in the late 1800s by Joseph Ferguson, who was also the village's first Kafotay (Chief in the Arawak language). At that time it was named "Pakuri" after the Platonia tree that were then plentiful in the area. The village was renamed St. Cuthbert's Mission when the first Anglican missionaries arrived at the village and founded a Mission there on Saint Cuthbert's Day in 1889.
In February 2011, St Cuthbert's suffered from a major flood, with levels of accumulated water reaching 311.3 millimetres. The flood resulted in substantial loss of crops and personal property for many villagers. In September 2011, St Cuthbert's hosted celebrations for Amerindian Heritage Month. The celebrations were attended by a number of senior government officials and thousands of visitors from Guyana as well as other countries.
Geography.
St Cuthbert's Mission is situated on the left bank of the Mahaica River. It is surrounded by savannah and shrub lands on its East side, and dense vegetation on its west side. The nearest large settlements are the capital city, Georgetown (57 miles away) and Mahaica (65 miles away by river).
Government.
St Cuthbert's Mission falls under the jurisdiction of the Region 4 (Demerara-Mahaica). However, one quarter of St Cuthbert's titled communal village lands are in Region 5 (Mahaica-Berbice), with the other three quarters lying in Region 4.
Like most other Amerindian villages in Guyana (and in accordance with the constitutional Amerindian Act), St Cuthbert's is governed by a Village Council under the leadership of a Toshao (or Chief). Toshaos are elected every three years, and are voted in by the local population in village elections. The council is made up of nine members, including the Toshao and an appointed secretary and treasurer. Village Council meetings are held monthly, on the last Saturday of every month.
Economy.
St. Cuthbert's is primarily a logging community, and logging provides the main source of income for the village. Since the 1990s, a large number of villagers have found work with Omai Gold Mines Ltd. Many villagers also practice subsistence farming.
The Toshao (Chief)is provided with a monthly stipend by the national government.
Culture.
Local art and the Lokono Group.
In August 1988, the leading Guyanese artist and native of St. Cuthbert's Mission, George Simon, founded a drawing and design workshop in the village. The workshop fostered a number of Lokono artistic talents in the village who have since achieved artistic recognition in their own right, including Oswald ("Ossie") Hussein, Foster Simon, Roland Taylor, Telford Taylor and Lynus Clenkian. These artists - including George Simon - are known collectively as the Lokono Artists Group. In 2002, Simon constructed an Arts Centre to allow local artists to exhibit their work. The Arts Centre was opened in September 2002.

Housing in China

In recent years, housing development has ballooned in China as its economy has developed. The government has promoted the commercialization of housing in urban areas since 1978. Property development has become big business in China, with new cities and suburbs springing up with new apartments, and house prices have rocketed in recent times.
Housing construction.
The most important objective of the Chinese government is to increase national GDP, and is launching building developments across China to promote economic development. However, property development in China is vastly outgrowing the number of people who can purchase them which sociologists show a major concern over and argue that it is leading to a deepening of social divisions in the country. Many apartments, hotels and shops remain empty for years, with many Chinese unable to afford them. As "The Economist" says, "If there is one thing that annoys the man on the Beijing omnibus, it is the cost of housing in China's cities."
The Chinese government announced in March 2011 the objective of building 36 million units of housing by 2015. In September 2011 alone, work commenced on 1.2 million units across China; a 70% increase in the construction of social housing compared with 2010.
Property bubble.
2011 estimates by property analysts state that there are some 64 million empty properties and apartments in China and that housing development in China is massively oversupplied and overvalued, and is a bubble waiting to burst with serious consequences in the future. The BBC cites Ordos in Inner Mongolia as the largest ghost town in China, full of empty shopping malls and apartment complexes. A large, and largely uninhabited urban real estate development has been constructed 25 km from Dongsheng District in the Kangbashi New Area. Intended to house a million people, it remains largely uninhabited. Intended to have 300,000 residents by 2010, government figures stated it had 28,000.
Critics argue that the national social-housing programme disproportionally benefits the urban population and that not only can many of the rural poor ill afford new housing in the cities, but they also find it difficult to obtain household-registration certificates (hukou). The housing development schemes is also affecting the concentration of unemployment as once housing development are completed, workers may be laid off. According to the former Director of China's Housing & Real Estate Administration Bureau, Professor Lin, as of 2008, Beijing had an average of 1.41 individuals per room across the city.

4th Ranger Infantry Company (United States)

The 4th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) was an airborne-trained infantry unit that was part of the United States Army during the Korean War. The 4th Rangers were created as a result of the actions of North Korean Special Forces units such as the KPA's 766th Independent Infantry Regiment that were overrunning Republic of Korea Army (ROK) and United Nations (UN) units. North Korean special units that were trained in the art of unconventional warfare were beating the ROK and UN units that were stationed in South Korea, pushing them back towards the Pusan Perimeter.
With the creation of the Eighth Army Ranger Company on August 24, 1950, the US Army established the first of fifteen airborne-qualified Ranger companies. On October 28, 1950, the next four Ranger companies were formed. The soldiers that formed these companies came from a number of units. Those that were drawn from the 82nd Airborne Division's 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment and 80th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion were used to form the 4th Ranger Infantry Company before it was redesigned the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne). The reastablished 4th Ranger company was resupplied with rangers from the 3rd Ranger Company (which was a training company at the time). The 2nd and 4th Ranger companies deployed from the United States to Korea on December 9, 1950.
When deployed to Korea the 4th Rangers were assigned to both the Headquarters of the Eighth United States Army and the 1st Cavalry Division. In February 1951 the 4th Rangers, along with the 2nd Ranger Company, were assigned to the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. The unit remained a part of the 187th RCT until April 4, 1951.

Liam Walker

Liam Walker (born 13 April 1988) is a Gibraltarian footballer who plays for Bnei Yehuda and the Gibraltar national team as a midfielder.
Career.
Spanish lower levels.
Walker began his career in Algeciras CF, making his debut on 22 October 2006, against Ayamonte. He received his first start on 22 May 2007, against CD Mairena. He already had trials with Manchester United, Everton and Aston Villa as a teenager.
In 2008 summer, Walker joined Atlético Zabal (Real Balompédica Linense's farm team), but only appeared in eight matches (575 minutes overall), scoring six times. During the 2009–10 season, he was promoted to Linense's first team, but only made four appearances, all from the bench, 89 minutes overall.
In January 2010, he signed with UD Los Barrios, and made his debut on the 31st, against Puerto Real CF. He scored his first goal on 27 April, against Sevilla FC C. In May 2010, Walker returned to Linense, getting more playing time than his last spell, appearing in 13 matches (849 minutes overall) and scoring once (against UD Los Palacios on 26 September).
In January of the following year, he signed a contract with CD San Roque, in Spanish fifth division. In his first season, he only appeared six times and scored once, with his team being promoted to fourth division. In his second season, he was the club's topscorer and best player of the season, scoring ten goals in 30 games (all starts).
Portsmouth.
In July 2012, Walker was called by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton to train with the club, after an impressive performance for Gibraltar. He was a part of the squad in the club pre-season matches, against Bolton Wanderers, on 4 August. In his next game, on 8 August, he scored the final goal, against AFC Wimbledon.
On 16 August, Walker signed a one-month contract with "Pompey". However, due to his international clearance not being made by RFEF in time, he was unable to play on the opening day of the League One season against Bournemouth. He only made his debut on 21 August 2012, in an away match against Colchester United, coming in for Kieran Djilali who started on the bench. Walker played on the wing on his debut whilst Portsmouth captain Brian Howard and Lee Williamson played in the centre. Portsmouth drew with Colchester 2–2, with goals for Pompey through Luke Rodgers and Jordan Obita. Walker also assisted Rodgers in the first goal of the match. He then started in the following two games (against Carlisle United and Oldham Athletic), before being dropped to the bench. Walker only received a start three months later, against Yeovil Town, on 29 December.
Walker scored his first league goal for Portsmouth against Scunthorpe United on 2 February 2013. He scored his second on the 16th, against Carlisle United, from the penalty spot. Walker finished the season with three assists, only behind Jed Wallace (5) and Brian Howard (6).
At the end of the season, Walker was challenged to earn a new deal by manager Guy Whittingham. However, on 9 July, Walker announced that he would join a Greek club.
Trials and back to San Roque.
It was reported that Walker turned up at a training base of Dundee United in Spain without notice and requested a possible trial. This was however refused by Dundee United's management. He was also linked to a move for Aris Thessaloniki, but the deal fell through. 
In late July, Walker returned to San Roque, only training with the club while waiting for a convincing offer from any club. On 2 August, he signed with San Roque.
Walker scored in his San Roque re-debut on 5 October, but in a 1–2 home loss against Recreativo B. He finished his second spell with the club with nine appearances, scoring two goals.
Bnei Yehuda.
On 9 January 2014, it was announced that Walker had been released from his contract with CD San Roque after his buyout clause had been met. On 21 January 2013 Walker joined Israeli Premier League side Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. on a two-and-a-half year contract, after being recommended by Yossi Benayoun and reuniting with former teammate James Keene.
International career.
Walker played in 2011 Island Games, starting in all Gibraltar's matches, and scoring a hat-trick against Ynys Môn on 27 June. Walker stand as the only professional player in the national team.

Jonas Green

Jonas Green (died 1767) was an American newspaper publisher during the Colonial Era in Maryland, and a strong opponent of The Stamp Act.
Early life.
Green was born into a family of printers. The family tradition had been begun in Massachusetts by his great-grandfather, Samuel Green, who was himself the successor to the earliest printers in the North American colonies, the Dayes of Cambridge. Samuel Green started his printing business in 1649 and producing a number of notable works, including Elliot's New Testament, translated into the Native American language.
Career.
Jonas Green moved to Maryland in 1738, and became the Province's official printer.
Green was a protégé of Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia. 
He became the publisher of the The Maryland Gazette. Its early masthead read as follows: 
Money was sometimes hard to come by, so Green sometimes traded an ad or a subscription for supplies. His wife, Anne Catharine Green, also helped to make ends meet by selling homemade chocolates at the post office.
The Maryland Gazette and the American Revolution.
Green, a born troublemaker, hated the Stamp Act, which among other things directly taxed his newspaper. Refusing to pay, he published the Gazette with what was then a blaring headline: "The Maryland Gazette Expiring: In Uncertain Hopes of a Resurrection to Life Again." Green wrote that because of the Stamp Act, the newspaper "will not any longer be published." In the bottom right-hand corner of the page, where the tax stamp should have been placed, there appeared instead a skull and crossbones. Calmer heads persuaded Green to return to publishing as part of the struggle against tyranny, and he later resumed publication under this banner headline: "An Apparition of the late Maryland Gazette, which is not dead, but only sleepeth." Defenders of this newspaper's claim as "the oldest in the nation" say this brief interruption of publication was not a business decision as much as a deliberate political statement by a determined and courageous publisher.
When Green died in 1767, his jobs as editor and publisher were taken over by his wife, Anne Catherine Hoof Green, making her the first woman to hold either of the top jobs at an American newspaper. A strong supporter of Colonial rights, she continued her husband's policy of operating an independent newspaper under the nose of the royal governor in Annapolis. Ultimately, she published the newspaper for eight years while raising 14 children. The newspaper stayed in the Green family for 94 years.
Legacy.
Jonas Green's house, where the Gazette was published for many years, still stands on Charles Street in downtown Annapolis, marked by a small historical plaque.

Sebezhsky National Park

Sebezhsky National Park () is a national park in the northwest of Russia, located in Sebezhsky District of Pskov Oblast. It was established on January 8, 1996. The national park was created to protect the landscapes of the lake district in the southwest of Pskov Oblast. 
The park covers .
Geography.
The southwestern part of Sebezhsky District, where the national park is located, is essentially hilly landscape of glacial origin with many lakes. The area is forested, with pine, spruce, mixed, and adler forests. The park occupies the southwestern corner of the district and borders with Latvia and Belarus. The center of the town of Sebezh lies immediately north of the park, and the southern part of the town is located in the park. Most of the area of the park belongs to the river basin of the Velikaya, and some areas in the south belong to the basin of the Daugava. The largest lakes within the park are Lake Necheritsa, Lake Sebezhskoye, and Lake Orono.
History.
The area was populated since antiquity. In the medieval times, it was subordinated to the city of Pskov. People initially settled at lakeshores, and eventually also populated spaces between the lakes. Since the 15th century, the area was disputed between the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, finally moving to Russia in 1772, during the First Partition of Poland. Already by the 15th century the lands were extensively used for agriculture. In the end of the 17th century, the agriculture was in crisis, partially related to the Livonian War, and partially to the old methods used; it was slowly recovering from the 17th century. In the 19th century, timber production considerably reduced forested areas; fishery on the lakes was common. In the 1950s, many swamps were drained and converted into agricultural lands. In the beginning of the 1990s, the agriculture was again in deep crisis, and it was decided to convert the area in the national park, protecting cultural and natural landscapes.
Fauna.
The park contains 291 species of vertebrates, including two species of lamprey, thirty species of fish, eight species of amphibians, five species of reptiles, 202 species of birds, and 49 species of mammals. Big mammals include brown bear, lynx, gray wolf, wild boar, moose, and roe deer.
Tourism and infrastructure.
In the park, there are a number of huts. Recreational hunting and fishery are permitted.
The part of the park along the state border with Latvia is included into a border security zone, intended to protect the borders of the Russian Federation from unwanted activity. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local Federal Security Service department is required.

The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) was formed in Mpumalanga, South Africa, in 1998 as a breakaway faction of the COSATU-affiliated National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). It was formally registered as a union in 2001. According to Mining Weekly, the union sees itself as distinct from NUM in that it is "apolitical and noncommunist".
Competition with NUM over bargaining rights, especially at the Impala Platinum and Lonmin mines in the Rustenburg area culminated in the violent Marikana miners' strike and what became known as the Marikana Massacre, in which police shot and killed over 30 strikers.
The AMCU now represents over 70% of Lonmin employees, compared to the 20% representation of the NUM. It is also the majority union at Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) and Impala Platinum.

<doc id="36744733" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36744733" title="Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children">
Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children

The Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children (FDCC) is a nonprofit organisation helps disadvantaged young children in the Caribbean to reach their full potential through early childhood development (ECD) outreach. Headquartered in Bridgetown, Barbados and serving the entire Caribbean, the FDCC is the region’s first indigenous foundation working in the ECD field.
To improve the care environment for the region’s youngest children, the FDCC prioritises access to good-quality ECD services (particularly for the socially vulnerable) and seeks to improve children’s readiness (skills and knowledge) to enter primary school.
The FDCC creates, controls and manages projects in several Caribbean nations. It also distributes resources as required. 
By targeting socially disadvantaged young children (birth to five years), the FDCC is different from other organisations working in the Caribbean ECD sector. Typically, other organisations and governments support mainstream, older children (once they have entered formal education structures).
History.
Context.
Many young children fail to experience any structured early childhood programming in the Caribbean. Just 17% to 41% of children aged from birth to three years are likely to participate; this rises to between 65% and 100% for the three- to five-year-old age group (primary school entry).
Evolution.
From 2002, an organisation funded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation and overseen by the Caribbean Centre for Development Administration (CARICAD) reviewed (a) parenting practices and (b) education in seven Caribbean countries with the aim of identifying replicable development models. The approach was regional and evolving; the intention was to share common methods between different Caribbean countries. This organisation was the Caribbean Support Initiative (CSI) which, in 2006, evolved into the Caribbean Child Support Initiative (CCSI) and, in 2011, evolved into the Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children (FDCC).
From 2002 to present, the CSI, CCSI and FDCC have sought to influence early childhood development (ECD) policies and programming, strengthen the Caribbean care environment, and respond to gaps in the ECD sector.
The FDCC builds on the work of the CSI and CCSI. By early 2011, CCSI-supported ECD programmes benefitted over 10,000 children (aged from birth to three years) and consulted with over 3,000 parents. These programmes also enabled more than 200 young adults to receive 1,500 hours of ECD training (a new route to higher education). In one year alone, 50 Roving Caregivers achieved certification in NCTVET Level 1.
Establishment.
When Bernard van Leer Foundation funding ended in 2011 (as scheduled), a real need remained for these initiatives. The FDCC was therefore established.
Operational history.
Following its launch on June 27, 2011, the FDCC became operational in January 2012.
Current projects.
Approach.
The FDCC believes ECD interventions must be sustainable, and this requires indigenous innovation. This, in turn, necessitates civic engagement (every level of the ECD sector must fully participate) in order to secure full recipient ownership (local ownership of programmes). 
The FDCC approach is therefore to help strengthen the ECD sector (its existing systems and services). No other Caribbean organisation takes the same approach.
The FDCC offers three interrelated types of service:
Roving Caregivers Programme (RCP).
The RCP is an informal home-visit ECD programme which reaches the youngest children (aged from birth to three years) who lack access to formal ECD services.
Early Childhood Health Outreach (ECHO).
The ECHO programme integrates the RCP with maternal and child health services. It targets socially vulnerable children (aged 0–5 years), their mothers and pregnant women. It was developed with UNICEF, PAHO and the St Vincent and the Grenadines Ministry of Health & Environment.
Family Learning Programme (FLP).
The FLP offers a model for family literacy and family learning. It offers teaching and learning materials, a training programme and a practitioner toolkit.
Youth and Community Advocacy Network (YouCAN).
Launched in 2010, YouCAN is a volunteer network of young people who seek community-level support for good-quality ECD and family support services.
Technical Programming Management Support.
To support culturally relevant ECD solutions for the Caribbean, raise quality standards, and build indigenous ECD capacity, the FDCC provides:

Ras Kouroun

Ras Kouroun, El-Katieh, or El-Kas, also known as Mount Kasion or Kasion Oros to Greek geographers such as Herodotus who considered it to mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria, is a small mountain near the marshy Lake Bardawil, the "Serbonian Bog" of Herodotus, where Zeus' ancient opponent Typhon was "said to be hidden". Here, Greeks knew, Baal Sephon was worshipped. 
The sandy mount stands out about the flat landscape, though it is a mere 100 metres above the sea.
Its name is given to the Catholic titular see of Casium.
Like Mount Casius in Syria, it was historically associated with a shrine to Zeus, one of whose epithets was Kasios.

722nd Anti-Armored Helicopter Squadron

The 722nd Anti-Armored Helicopter Squadron ("Serbo-Croatian: 722. protivoklopna helikopterska eskadrila / 722. противоклопна хеликоптерска ескадрила") was a helicopter squadron of the Yugoslav Air Force formed in February 1954 as 27th Helicopter Squadron ("Serbo-Croatian: 27. helikopterska eskadrila/ 27. хеликоптерска ескадрила").
History.
The 27th Helicopter Squadron was formed at Pančevo airfield by order from July 16, 1953. It was established with delivery of first British-made US-licensed Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 Mk.1b "Dragonfly" helicopters. The squadron was supposed to be independent, but it was attached to 119th Transport Aviation Regiment. It was the first helicopter unit of the Yugoslav Air Force. On March 31, 1954 Captain Jović has performed flight capabilities of new helicopters in Yugoslav arsenal to Marshal of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito.
Two Agusta Bell 47J helicopters have been transferred from JAT Yugoslav Airlines to squadron due the problems with maintenance.
By the 1961 and application of the "Drvar" reorganization for the Air Force, new type designation system is used to identify squadrons, so the 27th Helicopter Squadron has become 783rd Helicopter Squadron ("Serbo-Croatian: 783. helikopterska eskadrila/ 783. хеликоптерска ескадрила"). In the same year, the squadron has been dislocated from Pančevo to Zemun airport where it has stayed short, moving next year to new Batajnica Air Base.
In 1965 all "Dragonfly" helicopters weer passed to 782nd Helicopter Squadron so in period from 1965 to 1967 it consisted only from one section equipped with Agusta Bell 47J helicopters. By order from February 17, 1966 squadron moves to Niš airport, being re-assigned to 107th Support Aviation Regiment. Same year domestic-made licensed Westland SOKO S-55 transport helicopters were introduced with squadron.
The whole 107th Regiment with its squadrons has moved to Mostar airport by order from November 1973. S-55 helicopters were replaced with new domestic-made licensed Soko SA.341 Gazelle light helicopters.
Squadron was again renamed by 1988, after being re-equipped with Gazelle Gama anti-tank helicopters in 1987. It has become 722nd Anti-Armored Helicopter Squadron. It has participated in combat operations during the war in Croatia.
It was disbanded on June 28, 1991. Most of equipment and personal has been passed to 97th Helicopter Regiment.

<doc id="36745102" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36745102" title="Flexible Plug and Play">
Flexible Plug and Play

Flexible Plug and Play is a research project looking at how to improve the connection of renewable energy generation, like wind farms, to electricity distribution networks in the UK. According to the original submission to Ofgem, the electricity regulator, it will test new technical solutions to problems on the network and develop new commercial arrangements between the energy supplier and network operator.
Funding.
The total cost of the project is £9.7 million. In 2011 Ofgem awarded £6.7 million to UK Power Networks from its Low Carbon Network Fund. UK Power Networks is contributing £2 million and the project partners a further £1 million.
Geographical area of research.
According to the original bid submission a rural area of around 700km2 between Peterborough, March and Wisbech in Cambridgeshire has been chosen as the test bed for the Flexible Plug and Play project. There are said to be 9 operational wind farms in the area with a total installed capacity of 100MW; a further 10 renewable generation sites have won consent or are at the submission stage, with an additional 10 sites currently subject to scoping studies. This gives a total of a further 188MW of potential wind generation in the same area. However, the progress report of June 2012 says the potential has increased to 200MW. Apparently connecting these extra wind farms to the existing distribution network would be difficult for a number of reasons including voltage constraints, thermal constraints and reverse power flows. It’s said that using a traditional approach of network upgrading/reinforcement would be costly and time consuming. As a result the research project will try out new ways of managing the existing network to accommodate this extra power without reinforcing the network.
Smart devices.
The Flexible Plug and Play project, according to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network in order to improve its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.
1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.
2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.
3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.
4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.
5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.
IEC 61850 Standard.
IEC 61850 is a standard for the engineering process for the configuration of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), the structure and naming of their data models and a number of communication mechanisms to support the real time operation of automation systems. The Flexible Plug and Play project plans, it is said, to deploy it on the distribution network in the test area. Silver Spring Networks and Cable and Wireless Worldwide are quoted as being the developing partners.

<doc id="36745104" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36745104" title="DRDO NETRA">
DRDO NETRA

NETRA (NEtwork TRaffic Analysis) is a software network developed by India's Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory, and is used by the Intelligence Bureau, India's domestic intelligence agency, and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country's external intelligence agency to intercept and analyse internet traffic using pre-defined filters. The program was tested at smaller scales by various national security agencies, and is reported to be deployed nation-wide soon, as of January 2014.
Development history.
Security agencies were looking to build a system that could monitor Internet traffic on a real time basis due to the rapidly escalating threat posed by terrorist and criminal elements using data communication, which had brought service providers like BlackBerry, Skype and Gmail into the focus of law enforcement agencies.
Two such systems were designed, one by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and the other by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), which is India's technical intelligence agency. An inter-ministerial committee staffed by members from Ministry of Home Affairs, Intelligence Bureau, Department of Telecom, Department of IT, and National Investigation Agency was formed to evaluate both systems and to select one internet monitoring system.
NTRO's system was designed with the help of Paladion, an international private company and NETRA was designed by a team of 40 scientists from CAIR. The committee selected CAIR's NETRA as it had multiple issues with NTRO's system. It had serious security reservations about involvement of an international private company in such a sensitive project, and had doubts about NTRO's ability to operate, maintain and upgrade their system independently. Also, RAW, which tested NTRO's system was not happy with the NTRO solution and reported that it crashed frequently. The committee favoured NETRA as it was an indigenous solution involving government scientists and personnel and no component of solution had been outsourced to an outside agency. The agency testing NETRA, the IB, was also pleased with its performance. The committee further observed that CAIR has been continuously investing in R&D to keep up with the fast-changing web technologies, unlike NTRO. The system was first demonstrated at the premises of Sify Technologies to capture the entire internet traffic passing through its probes.
Capabilities.
NETRA can analyse voice traffic passing through software such as Skype and Google Talk, and intercept messages with keywords such as 'attack', 'bomb', 'blast' or 'kill' in real-time from the enormous number of tweets, status updates, emails, instant messaging transcripts, internet calls, blogs, forums and even images generated on the internet to obtain the desired intelligence. The system with RAW analyses large amount of international data which crosses through the internet networks in India. Three security agencies, which include the IB and RAW, have each been allotted a maximum of 300 Gigabytes (GB) for storing intercepted internet traffic, and an extra 100 GB is assigned to the remaining law enforcement agencies.
Users.
The "Internet Scanning and Coordination Centre" will use this system to monitor the Internet, similar to the ones used by USA, UK, China, Iran and many other nations. Initially, RAW was the only current user of this monitoring system, but in 2013, the Ministry of Home Affairs recommended the use of a second NETRA system by domestic law enforcement agencies. This was done as the intelligence gathered by the external intelligence agency were largely irrelevant for the use by law enforcement agencies, and could not handle more data. A note from the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) stated that the system can provide access to multiple security agencies.
Netra's deployment was discussed in 2013 by an apex inter-ministerial group headed by DoT, and included representative from the Cabinet Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs, DRDO, CAIR, Intelligence Bureau, C-DoT and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).
Awards and recognition.
DRDO Scientist Dr. G. Athithan of CAIR and his team were awarded the 'Agni award for excellence in self-reliance 2008' for developing NETRA. The team comprised scientists from Indian Institute of Science, G.Ravindra and Rahul M. Kharge.

Susana Rodríguez

Susana Rodríguez (born 1980) is a Mexican visual artist who has had a number of solo exhibitions and has participated in various group exhibitions.
Her work often consists of installations.
Biography.
Susana Rodríguez was born in Guadalajara, México in 1980.
She attended the University of Guadalajara, where she studied visual arts. 
She was a founding member of the "Colectivo de Acción y Creación Artística" (Collective of Action and Artistic Creation). 
In 2006-2007 FONCA ("Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes" - National Fund for Culture and the Arts) awarded her a grant for young creators.
Work.
In 2008 Rodríguez held a solo exhibition at the Museo Raúl Anguiano in Guadalajara called "El día de la langosta" (The day of the locust).
The theme of the show was the destructive power of humans, and the way in which a small action such as killing a fly can trigger effects in distant regions.
It draws on Chaos theory and the Chinese proverb that the flapping wings of a butterfly can be felt across the world, and also has religious undertones.
The exhibition attempts the difficult task of depicting the moment of destruction and what happens as a result.
It starts with a car that has crashed into a huge tree, represented by an acrylic painting on one wall of the room.
It continues with a collage showing the tiny figures of angels and cherubs who live with birds and wild animals, and moves on
to a dark room where a fly is hovering in video format.
The artist chose the title because a locust is a very passive and quiet creature, but turns into a savage beast when its habitat is disturbed, causing further destruction in a domino effect. 
A critic has described the work as "silent poetry", using images rather than words.
Rodríguez was inspired by the flash fiction story "El emigrante" by Luis Felipe Lomelí to create an installation named "¿Olvida usted algo? – ¡Ojalá!" that opened in August 2009 at the Casa del Lago in Mexico City.
This work explores the idea of a building that perhaps has been destroyed during a storm, but where traces remain of the time when it was inhabited.
The outdoor installation is constructed of bricks, concrete, ceramic tiles and a wooden door. 
The work is ambiguous, leaving it to the viewer to interpret whether the building was destroyed, is in the process of being built, or is complete.
The artist has said she addresses the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable.
In July 2009 Rodríguez participated with Emily Landon and Katie Murray in the group exhibition "The Communication Consideration Coordination" at the Kate Werble Gallery in New York. For the exhibition she constructed a "container" that combined sculpture, mural painting and cut vinyl to make a 3-dimensional scene that incorporated the gallery façade.
She returned to the Kate Werble Gallery for the exhibition "Pinch Pots and Pyramids" (October–December 2009), with artists Liliane Lijn, Sam Moyer, Ryan Reggiani, Halsey Rodman and Molly Smith. Her work at this show was based on broken and reassembled ceramic cups.
Exhibitions.
Solo exhibitions include: 
Group exhibitions in which she has participated include:
In January–March 2010 her work was included in the MexiCali Biennial at the Otis Ben Maltz Gallery.

Frank's Cock

"Frank's Cock" is a 1993 Canadian short film written and directed by Mike Hoolboom. The eight-minute production stars Callum Keith Rennie as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with AIDS, and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at People With AIDS, which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film about breaking up.
Shot on a low budget, the work is shown in a split-screen format with interspersed scenes from popular culture, gay pornography, and human embryo formation; this format is meant to symbolise the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers. Produced by Alex Mackenzie, "Frank's Cock" was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the NFB–John Spotton Award for best Canadian short film at the 1994 Toronto International Film Festival. The script has been republished several times and has inspired a short on LGBT issues in Canada's native community.
Synopsis.
An unnamed narrator (Callum Keith Rennie), who as a teenager intended to be the "Michael Jordan of sex" or "Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on", discusses how he met and fell in love with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a group sex session, they began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's "Morningside" during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank – having lost much weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas – has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with "I'm going to miss him. He was the best friend I ever had."
Production.
The Canadian director Mike Hoolboom was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 or 1989, after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that he felt himself working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became "fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again", experimenting with "interruptive rhythms" as a way to reexamine simple acts. Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; "Frank's Cock" was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.
While living in Vancouver, Hoolboom joined the local People With AIDS (PWA) group. There he befriended a man (Joey in some sources, Alan in others) whose partner was dying of AIDS. Upon his friend's suggestion, Hoolboom began work on a script for "a real movie": one which portrayed an AIDS patient as full of love, not one that showed the patient's friends abandoning him. The friend was, however, unwilling to appear in the film. In writing the script Hoolboom tried to keep elements of humour; he later said that the humour was necessary as the source had insisted "most of our relationship was incredibly joyous and happy and a good time".
After receiving a commission to make a short film for the Vancouver-based cooperative Cineworks, Hoolboom began working on realising the script with a low budget and limited amount of 16 mm film from the National Film Board of Canada; he was one of seven artists commissioned to "spark local production" with short films on breakup, which were ultimately included in the omnibus "Breaking Up". Rennie – at that time a relative unknown – agreed to deliver the monologue. Hoolboom was pleased with the results, writing that Rennie presented the monologue as if "he'd been living this story all along." The majority of the technical work, including direction, cinematography, and editing, was handled by Hoolboom; Alex Mackenzie, working for Cineworks, produced the film.
Part of the terms of his grant were that Hoolboom was allowed a limited number of edits (one or three). After pondering how to complete the film under such terms, Hoolboom chose to use no edits. He recorded previously edited footage, some appropriated from various sources, through a hole in a piece of cardboard, producing a single quadrant; he repeated this process three times, using the same film, which resulted in four quadrants with four different images. Production was completed by early 1993, and in screenings "Frank's Cock" was marketed as an "extremely explicit" experimental film.
Although societal awareness of AIDS had developed at a slower pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's "No Sad Songs" and John Erman's "An Early Frost" respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made "Frank's Cock"; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.
Style.
"Frank's Cock" divides the screen into quadrants, with the majority of the film focusing on the upper-right corner of the screen. In this panel, Rennie's character gives a monologue, which is sometimes illustrated by images in other panels: the lower-right panel flashes scenes of hardcore gay pornography, the upper-left shows scenes representing human embryo formation, while the lower-left flashes excerpts from popular art. Aside from the original footage of Rennie, the short appropriated clips from the "Nova" episode "The Miracle of Life", the gay pornographic film "The Best of Blondes", and the music video for Madonna's 1992 song "Erotica". The effect was later reused in Hoolboom's 1997 short "Positiv".
Janis Cole, writing for "POV" magazine, described the split-screen effect as supporting the text while "creating an optical treatment purposefully grounded in both dream and reality", as elements show out of sync. Jeff Rush and Cynthia Baughman, writing in the "Journal of Film and Video", described the film as showing that "text can reverse the traditional balance of words = abstractions/images = the concrete" through the creation of vivid, perhaps disturbing, word pictures which serve as tangible images contrasted with the faint abstractions which are the actual images. Jack Rusholme, prefacing a retrospective of Hoolboom's works by Experimenta Media Arts, wrote that the split-screen evokes the effects of AIDS, in which "the body broken into dispersed vantages", while the narration serves to "bind with words what this disease will render lifeless and inert". In a 1994 interview, Hoolboom stated that his intent was to represent the "fragmentation of the body" experienced by AIDS sufferers.
Reception.
"Frank's Cock" has received warm critical reviews, both in Canada and abroad. Cole called it an "extraordinary experimental documentary" that is "as bold as the title implies" and a strong argument for the widespread dissemination of short films. Waugh placed "Frank's Cock" as one of a "great AIDS triptych", together with Hoolboom's later works "Letters from Home" (1996) and "Positiv". The Canadian film scholar Darell Varga wrote that the film is an "emotionally riveting" eulogy to the loss of love. Karen Tisch, writing in "Take One", found that the short built its emotional power "delicately but steadily"; she suggested that its Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) win was well-deserved.
Reviewing for the Western Australian independent film magazine "In the Picture", James Twentyman wrote that the film was "relatively straightforward" but strong and provocative, emphasising the "soul-baring" nature of the monologue. Rush and Baughman found that the short took the narrative voice beyond what is mainstream, demonstrating "the power of word and image", while Rusholme described "Frank's Cock" as Hoolboom's "most explicit AIDS narrative". The Swiss film festival Viper touted the short as expressing humour and sexual obsession in the face of a plague.
Hoolboom has stated that he felt the film was accessible to both gay or straight audiences, which should "open them up to differences of form and why would make something formally different." Waugh suggested that this was successful, as in his experience audiences often cried at screenings.
Legacy.
"Frank's Cock" won several awards at domestic and international film festivals. At the 1994 TIFF it won the NFB–John Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited "Frank's Cock" for its "evocative images, ... impeccable writing and mise en scene, ... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss in the age of AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions". The selection included C$2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of film processing. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped ""Frank's Cock" has never seemed so large"; Waugh, however, suggests that the title "caused more embarrassment than mirth" when it was read during the citation. Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's "Make Some Noise" and Philip Hoffman's "Technilogic Ordering".
That year the film won a Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival in Locarno, Switzerland. At the Ann Arbor Film Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, "Frank's Cock" won Best Dramatic Film. The Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre, which has distribution rights for the film, notes further awards at the Interfilm Festival in Berlin and Second Prize Experimental at the Big Muddy Film Festival in Carbondale, Illinois (both 1995), while Hoolboom records "Frank's Cock" as receiving an honourable mention at the University of Oregon's Queer Film Fest (1994).
The script for "Frank's Cock" has been published several times, including in the script anthology "By the Skin of Their Tongues" and in the "Journal of Film and Video" (both 1997). The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' "Secret Weapons" (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike "Frank's Cock", "Secret Weapons" focused on an LGBT identity within Canada's native community.
After his success at the TIFF, Hoolboom directed numerous further films, many showing a "fascination with its impermanence"; several, including "Letters From Home", dealt explicitly with AIDS. Rennie, who had also received critical acclaim for his supporting role in Mina Shum's "Double Happiness" (1994), later became known for playing villains in Hollywood films.

Female detective Joe Frye makes an appearance in "A killing Rain" and has since played a larger role in the series, according to the authors website "She stayed in the book to help him solve the crime. And then, well, she and Louis kind of fell hard for each other. And we fell for her. Our plan is to alternate the characters or have them appear in books together"

RREUSE

RREUSE (Reuse and Recycling Social Enterprises in the European Union) is a European non-governmental organisation (NGO) and the first European umbrella organisation of social enterprises with activities in the reuse, repair and recycling sector. The very specialised European network puts the three pillars of sustainability at an equal level: environmental protection, social equity, and economic viability.
Mission and activity.
RREUSE's mission is "to lobby at European level for stronger policies in favour of repair and reuse of end-of-life products to avoid that products become waste too early". Additionally, RREUSE also "participates on social economy legislation with a specific focus on green employment linked to social inclusion and training initiatives for those most removed from the labour mainstream market". Therefore repair, reuse and recycling activities within social enterprises should expand and develop across Europe.
According to the statutes, to reach the scope of their mission the RREUSE activities include
RREUSE also carries out international projects in cooperation with other institutions like universities and research centres, for example the LOWaste Project or the Quali Pro Second Hand Project II (a European project on the innovation transfer of a qualification profile "second hand").
In 2011 RREUSE received the European Week for Waste Reduction award for the Waste watchers campaign.
Members.
RREUSE has currently 22 members in 12 European countries.
The members of RREUSE are national and regional social economy networks that combine both social as well as environmental objectives. 
Within the RREUSE network 42.000 full-time equivalent jobs are provided and more than 150.000 volunteers and trainees are involved in RREUSE members’ projects.
The activities of the members can be described with
Currently (17/08/2012) the members are:
Origin.
Between 1999 and 2001 the interest on social enterprises working together in the environmental services has been increased and therefore a couple of events and projects was set by a few organisations from the social economy sector.
At the same time a couple of organisations started working together on the forthcoming of the European WEEE Directive (which was adopted 2001) as they were concerned about the impact which the WEEE-Directive could have on social enterprises working in the recycling and reuse sector.
To create a more stable platform of discussion where organisations could follow the political debates and decisions in Brussels on a more regular basis, on a conference in November 2000 the idea to create a European network of social enterprises working in the waste sector was developed. Finally 17 networks of social enterprises elaborated the constitution in Barcelona on the 26th of February 2001. Representatives from the European Parliament, from the Belgium Ministry for Social Economy and from the Directorate Environment of the European Commission appreciated the foundation of the network and expressed their general support. 
RREUSE was founded under the Belgium law with the status of a Non-profit organisation. The original members are 
In 2003 RREUSE opened a secretariat in Brussels.
Structure of the network.
RREUSE has a non bureaucratic structure. 
The members meet 3 times a year working on the different waste streams, such as WEEE (Waste electrical and electronic equipment), textiles, bulky waste, bioswaste, resource consumption and product policies etc. Most of the work is done by volunteer members between the meetings.
The coordinating office is located in the Mundo-B house, an ecologically renovated office building in the center of Brussels for Belgium and international environmental and social NGO's.
Funding.
RREUSE is financed by the membership fees.
In the first two years RREUSE received also some funding from the Belgium government to promote the launch of the organisation. Later RREUSE also received some funding by DG Environment and DG Education.

Julian Berntzen

Julian Berntzen (born 2 February 1981 in Bergen, Norway) is a Norwegian vocalist, pianist, violinist and composer known for his "Magnetic North Orchestra". He is the son of artist and guitarist Lasse Berntzen, and the grandson of actor Rolf Berntzen.
Career.
Berntzen began playing several instruments as young. At 17, several of his compositions for string quartet, was performed by members of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. He toured in 2001 with musicians from Steiner schools in South Africa and Norway, and was the driving force behind the release of an album with concert recordings from this project.
Berntzen did not compose pop music until he was 20 years old. Then he sat down and composed "Waffy Town", a city with colorful and exciting characters. Exactly a year later he gave his first concert with samples from this fictional town, the album "Waffy Town" was released on the label New Records. The recordings were made in Gjøa Studio in Bergen, while the mastering was done by Nick Webb at Abbey Road's legendary Studio in London. Producer Hans Petter Gundersen and Kato Ådland played the bass and guitars, and Tarjei Strøm (from Ralph Myerz & The Jack Herren Band) played the drums. The rest - a dozen instruments, and numerous vocal orders - was made by Berntzen himself. As much as the music was mesmerizing, the cover of blinding: Lasse Berntzen had packed the disc into a 40-page book in CD format, with a number of old photographs and style right colors that helped to enhance the listening experience. The album received Spellemannprisen 2003 (Norwegian Grammy), as this year's newcomer and was nomimert for the Best Male Pop Singer the same year. The follow-up developed on this idea.
Lately Berntzen has composed music for the play "Snow Queen" (Hans Christian Andersen), put up on Den Nationale Scene, Bergen, in October 2012.

World Esperantist Vegetarian Association

The World Esperantist Vegetarian Association ("Tutmonda Esperantista Vegetarana Asocio," TEVA) is a voluntary association of Esperanto-speaking vegetarians. Founded in 1908, the group's working language is Esperanto, and it is the oldest international organization of vegetarians that is currently active. TEVA published a journal, "Vegetarano" ("Vegetarian") from 1914 to 1932, revived in 2009 as "Esperantista Vegetarano", and has also operated a spirited Internet mailing list through Yahoo! Groups since 2005.
Esperanto and vegetarianism.
Surveys among members of the British Esperanto Association (1968) and the German Esperanto Association (1992) have found that there are proportionally far more vegetarians among Esperanto speakers than among non-Esperantists. Peter Forster, author of "The Esperanto Movement", suggests that there is a general relationship between vegetarianism and pacifism — and, therefore, also between vegetarianism and Esperanto.
History of TEVA.
Already by 1893 two favourable articles about vegetarianism, had appeared in "La Esperantisto" ("The Esperantist") — both later incorporated into "Fundamenta krestomatio" (1903), L. L. Zamenhof's basic Esperanto reader: "La hejmo de la metiisto" ("The home of the craftsman") and "Kio estas vegetarismo?" "What is vegetarianism?"). A third example may also be mentioned: an article about the longevity of centenarians, which pointed out that a common factor seemed to be a largely plant-based diet. The publication of such stories and articles suggests that Zamenhof himself had a positive attitude towards vegetarianism.
On August 16, 1908, at the Fourth World Congress of Esperanto in Dresden, Germany, the International Union of Esperantist Vegetarians ("Internacia Unuiĝo de Esperantistaj Vegetaranoj", IUEV) was founded. Several years later the group changed its name to Vegetarian Esperantist League ("Vegetara Ligo Esperantista", VLE). Finally, just after World War II, it adopted its present name, World Esperantist Vegetarian Association ("Tutmonda Esperantista Vegetarana Asocio," TEVA).
The association was founded at the instigation of René de Ladevèze. According to the "Enciklopedio de Esperanto", Leo Tolstoy (himself a committed vegetarian) agreed to serve as its honorary president. According to "Esperantista Vegetarano" (1995, p. 23), Ludwik Zamenhof was also among the 19 founding members but requested that this not be mentioned in their vegetarian literature. This information has not been corroborated elsewhere.
Two days after the IUEV founding convention, the International Vegetarian Union (IVU) was established, also in Dresden, this latter group intended primarily as an association of those vegetarians who were not also Esperantist. 
J. Arthur Gill, an Esperanto speaker who was secretary of a Quaker group known as the Friends Vegetarian Society, founded in 1902, had suggested that the vegetarian non-Esperantists could hold their own founding convention in connection with the earlier event and that Esperanto vegetarians could attend both events and help international understanding at the IVU's convention through the neutral medium of Esperanto. In the end, however, only a few Esperantists actually attended the IVU founding convention on August 18, 1908.
By the time of its 1913 IVU convention at The Hague, Esperanto was one of the IVU's five official languages, along with English, French, German and Dutch.
In 1914 the first issue of the magazine "Vegetarano" appeared, edited by Esperantist August Oskar Bünemann (1885–1958). From 1927 until 1932, the magazine was both a magazine for Esperantist vegetarians and an official organ of the International Vegetarian Union. In addition to Esperanto-language articles, it contained information about international vegetarianism written in English, French and German. For financial reasons, IVU stopped publishing the magazine in 1932.
In 1954, Nathan Ben Zion Havkin, founder of the Palestine-Israel Vegetarian Foundation, reorganized TEVA, which was further reawakened in 1971 by Arnošt Váňa, of Slovakia (1909-1998). He introduced a principle whereby instead of paying a fixed membership fee, members could individually decide on the amount of their annual donation. TEVA maintained this system until 2008.
In 1992 Váňa was succeeded as president by Christopher Fettes, a Briton who had become an Irish citizen. For a few years a schism resulted, as TEVA had to reconcile inconsistent records of Italian and Slovakian membership numbers and donation receipts, and had also to resolve uncertainty as to who had been chosen as board members to represent those countries. The problems were blamed on the 85-year-old Váňa, whose health had begun to deteriorate in the last years of his life before he died in 1998. The schism was eventually healed when the membership ended Váňa's experiment, replacing his leadership through a loose collective of friends with a restored society structure properly governed by its constitution and by-laws through a democratically elected board.
Among the above-mentioned activists or supporters, four have served as honorary presidents of TEVA: Leo Tolstoy, René de Ladevèze, Nathan Ben Zion Havkin and Arnošt Váňa.
TEVA's aims and activities.
According to its constitution and by-laws, the association aims to "promote Esperanto among vegetarians and vegetarianism among Esperantists... in active and friendly and active collaboration, with the goal of respect for nature and all living beings." Its motto is "Vivu kaj lasu vivi" ("Live and let live.")
Since 2009 TEVA has published the twice-yearly magazine "Esperantista Vegetarano" (approx. 40 pages per issue), successor to both the previously published "Vegetarano" and the "Letero de la Esperantista Vegetarano" supplement.
Its meetings are not arranged independently, but are usually held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the World Congress of Esperanto. In addition, TEVA affiliates with other Esperantist and vegetarian groups. For example, TEVA members worked at the 36th International Vegetarian Union convention in 2004 in Florianópolis, Brazil, and at its 38th convention in Dresden, where the IVU and TEVA jointly celebrated their 100-year jubilee.
With representatives currently in 22 countries, the group is a member of both the International Vegetarian Union and the European Vegetarian Union, as well as being a specialized association affiliated with the World Esperanto Association, known by its Esperanto acronym as UEA.
In 2008, TEVA started a blog at the photo-sharing and social-networking site Ipernity; in 2009 TEVA added a group of Esperantist vegetarians through the social networking company CouchSurfing International.

ThinkPad Tablet 2

The ThinkPad Tablet 2 is a tablet computer announced in 2012 and released by Lenovo in 2013. The Tablet 2 is the Windows 8-based successor to the original Android-based ThinkPad Tablet.
Launch.
In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ThinkPad, Lenovo held a large party in New York where it announced several products, including the Tablet 2. Although Lenovo indicated that the ThinkPad Tablet 2 would be available on 26 October 2012 when Windows 8 was released, it later indicated that the device would be available in December 2012. However, delivery for orders in December were not made until late January and beyond.
Features.
Design.
According to "The Verge", "It may be a ThinkPad, but this device is unequivocally a tablet — a wide, skinny, thin tablet, more like a Kindle Fire HD than a MacBook Air. The all-black exterior is sleek but utterly ordinary, and its 1.3-pound heft is pretty much bog standard as well. It's certainly well-made, with comfortable rounded corners and a soft-touch matte finish, it's just not a particularly unique look." The Tablet 2 has a magnesium frame and a black polycarbonate case.
Specifications and performance.
The Tablet 2 uses the Intel Atom Z2760 SoC (System on a chip) platform. The CPU falls under the Clover Trail version of the Intel Atom processor and runs at 1.8 GHz and has 2 cores with 1 Mb of cache. The Tablet 2 has 2 gigabytes of 800 MHz LPDDR2 memory and comes with either a 32- or 64-gigabyte eMMC. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 runs the Windows 8 Professional operating system from Microsoft. It will be able to run any desktop software compatible with this version of Windows. In a review, CNET wrote, "Windows 8 looked readable and functional, both in Metro and standard Windows-based interfaces."
The Tablet 2 has a 10.1-inch IPS display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 400 nits, 500:1 contrast ratio and a resolution of 1,366 by 768. The graphics is powered by the PowerVR SGX545 graphics, that is part of the Intel Atom SoC. The Tablet 2 makes use of multi-touch technology for screen-based input (five-finger gesture). Like the original ThinkPad Tablet the Tablet 2 has an optional stylus for precision input. The stylus can be stored in the side of the tablet. Lenovo will also release a Bluetooth keyboard that can be carried with the tablet in a folio-style case.
The Tablet 2 has one USB 2.0 port and another micro-USB 2.0 to be used for charging only. Powered USB devices will not work on the USB port. External displays can be connected using the mini-HDMI port. You will also find a headphone/microphone combo jack and one dock connecter on the device. The following hardware buttons can be found around the tablet: Windows button, Power button, volume control button, rotation lock switch, reset switch. Models with 3G and 4G cellular data are both available. The Tablet 2 will have Near Field Communications, also known as NFC, built in.
The tablet is also equipped with two cameras. It has an 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, and is capable of 720p video capture. The front camera is 2.0 megapixels. A mini-HDMI port is included for video output. A noise-canceling microphone is included in order to facilitate video conferencing.
The built-in battery is a 30 watt-hour lithium polymer battery. Lenovo quotes 25 days of standby power, 150 hours of MP3 playback, and up to ten hours web browsing, and ten hours of local video playback.
Reviews.
David Pierce wrote for "The Verge", "I like almost everything about the ThinkPad Tablet 2. It's a handsome, well-made device that offers excellent battery life, does everything I'd expect a tablet to, and does it all well. It even does a few things I wouldn't expect from a slate – try running Photoshop or Steam on your iPad, I'll wait — and even if it doesn't do them especially well, its ability to masquerade as a "real computer" is still a big advantage. At the risk of beating a dead horse, this isn't a replacement for a Windows PC like the Acer Aspire S7 or Lenovo's own Yoga 13, but next to the other Windows tablets on the market it's clearly the best option. It's also the best Atom-powered device I've tried, beating the HP Envy X2, the Acer Iconia W510, and others on battery life, performance, and especially build quality — but they do have trackpads, so choose your tradeoffs wisely."
Mark Taormino wrote in a review for "Examiner.com", "Windows 8 has been designed to operate on a tablet, and leverage existing Microsoft applications such as Word and Excel. Student complaints abound that the current tablets do not support Word or Excel, so are of limited value in education settings. This is primarily true in higher education where students write many papers, and use spreadsheet software. The standard, like it or not, is Word and Excel. The introduction of a Microsoft operating system that can run on tablets and can support Microsoft applications will have widespread appeal to students."
In a review for "IT PRO" Khidr Suleman wrote, "During our hands-on, we found the stylus glided across the surface of the display smoothly. The accuracy of the handwriting recognition software was also reasonable and it converted our scribbles into text in the blink of an eye." He also wrote, "We found the device to be easy to hold and Windows 8 ran was smoothly. However, we did find there was a noticeable stutter when playing full HD video and switching between applications. However, as this is a pre-production model, we expect this to be ironed out."
In its review of the ThinkPad Tablet 2 the"Notebook Review" wrote, "The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 is fantastic device when used as a casual tablet or business PC for a mobile sales force. The machine looks great, it's light and easy to hold, and the battery lasts all day. Users who simply want to browse the web or run basic productivity applications will be best served by this hybrid tablet, but those users also probably won't need a $740 Windows 8 machine either. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 targets an audience that wants more productivity options that what an iPad or Windows 7 netbook offer. However, with the machine's limited Intel Atom processor and integrated graphics, the device struggles to take full advantage of everything Windows 8 has to offer. Additionally, users who do not opt for the $120 keyboard dock will find the device's productivity greatly hindered."

Fort d'Andoy

The Fort d'Andoy is one of nine forts built as part of the Fortifications of Namur in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1888 and 1892 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Andoy was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Namur in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. The fort is now abandoned on private property.
Description.
The Fort d'Andoy is located about southeast of the center of Namur. The fort forms a triangle in plan, and is one of the larger Namur forts. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif, closely grouped in a solid mass of concrete. 
Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Namur), with lesser protection than the front and "salient" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear. The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21cm. The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used . Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.
Armament.
Andoy's guns included one twin 15cm turret, two single 21cm turrets and two twin 12cm turrets, all for distant targets. Four 57mm turrets with another eight 57mm guns in embrasures providing defense of the fort's ditches and postern. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight.
The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.
First World War.
Andoy fired its first shots of World War I on 14 August 1914. German fire first hit the fort on 21 August. Andoy was heavily targeted by German artillery from 22 August to 24 August 1914, hit by an estimated 450 to 600 305mm projectiles. The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Andoy was hit in the kitchen and magazine on the 21st, damaging their overhead protection. The 15 cm turret and on 57mm turret were put out of action. The utility plant was damaged on the 22nd, killing Lieutenant Tasnier and five or six soldiers. Heavy damage caused panic in the garrison, but the fort continued to hold out with help from supporting infantry. Andoy's remaining armament fired on German positions on the 23rd, but the 21cm turret was destroyed, killing seven, followed by the destruction of two more turrets. The utility plant was knocked out entirely, leaving the fort with no electricity or ventilation, and the air quickly became unbreathable. Artillery fire stopped in the afternoon of the 23rd, and the interval troops and three functioning 57mm turrets repelled a German infantry assault. Shelling resumed during the night. On the 24th, with the ceiling of the main assembly hall threatening to collapse. Commandant Nollet assembled his 215 remaining men, sabotaged his last functioning armament and surrendered at 1115 hours to the 11th Battalion of the German 32nd Infantry.
The Germans occupied the fort from 1914 to 1918. In 1915 the Germans undertook an improvement program for Andoy and other Namur positions, remedying some of their faults. By 1916 the fort's latrines and bakery had been moved for better protection, the postern and main entry were reinforced, and ventilation had been substantially improved. The fort's concrete was augmented with additional material and metal supports.
Fortified Position of Namur.
Andoy's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Namur, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border. Protection was substantially increased and armament was modernized. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. Four 57mm turrets were re-equipped with 75mm guns, and new guns were mounted in the other cupolas, except for the 21cm turrets, which were not re-used. A ventilation tower was added at the end of a tunnel, that could serve as an observation post for spotting artillery fire. The area surrounding the fort was equipped with improved shelters for the interval troops.
Second World War.
In May 1940 the Fort d'Andoy was commanded by Commandant Degehet. Following the opening of hostilities between Belgium and Germany, the fort fired on German aircraft without effect. German troops approached on the 13th, taking fire from the fort. Heavier forces, including armored vehicles, approached on the 14th. In the 15th the supporting infantry was ordered to retreat. That afternoon the Germans began to take control of Namur. The fort's air tower took fire from light artillery. Heavier combat took place the next day, and firing became general by the 16th.On the 18th Andoy fired in support of the Fort de Marchovelette, but Marchevolette surrendered at 2000 hours. On the 21st the Fort de Saint-Héribert and the Fort de Malonne requested support. Andoy fired its 75mm guns on the distressed forts, but they were overrun. On the 22nd German forces began a sustained attack on Andoy, supported by 88mm high-velocity guns. The Fort de Maizeret and the Fort de Dave fired on Andoy in support of the defenders, successfully repelling the initial assault. Some of the observation positions were destroyed by German fire, but enough remained in operation to allow coordination with the neighboring forts.
Maizeret and Andoy were attacked on the 23rd. Dave supported the two forts, who supported each other. The garrison noted that the fort's eclipsing turrets could not rise fast enough to avoid being hit by 37mm anti-tank guns before they could fire. The attack intensified so that the turrets and observation cupolas could not be occupied. Saint-Héribert, Maizeret and Malonne surrendered, and Andoy's armament was reduced to one 75mm gun and a grenade launcher turret. The Germans delivered an ultimatum under a flag of truce, demanding the surrender of the fort and threatening aerial bombardment. Andoy's remaining weapons were sabotaged and the fort was surrendered by Commandant Degehet at 1730, receiving military honors from the Germans. The garrison was taken into custody and sent to prisoner of war camps in East Prussia. There were a total of four Belgian dead at Andoy. More than 300 Germans had been killed or wounded in the actions of May around the fort.
Present.
The Fort d'Andoy is on private property and is not open to the public. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II. It is used as a hunting ground and is in poor condition, overgrown with vegetation.

Joel P. Navarro

Joel Magus P. Navarro (born 1955) is a Filipino-American conductor and music educator. He is one of the Philippines' most esteemed choral conductors. He is also a composer, singer, arranger, choral clinician, writer, producer, music minister, and book editor. He was born to a musical family, the first grandchild to Dalmacio and Felipa Pizaña, who were one of the earliest converts to Evangelical Christianity in the Philippines when the Americans came in 1898. He is the eldest of three children to Jose Navarro Navarro, Jr. (1928-1980), a former businessman, stage actor, and orator; and Angeles Pizaña (b. 1932), a mezzo-soprano, music educator, and choir conductor. His siblings are Jeriel David (1956-1980), and Arlene Grace (b. 1962), a clinical counselor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Navarro was also involved in drama, musical theater, and opera during his college days. He was Creon in Jean Anouilh's "Antigone" in a play directed by Behn Cervantes, professor of drama and theater at the University of the Philippines. In musical theater, he was arguably the first Joseph in Asia who played the title role in Webber and Rice's "Joseph and His Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" in 1972, a play directed by now famous off-Broadway director Loy Arcenas. He was also involved in many musical theater productions in the 70s which played at the Cultural Center of the Philippines and Meralco Theater. These include acting stints with Lerner-Loewe's "My Fair Lady," Webber-Rice's "Jesus Christ Superstar," Leonard Bernstein's "Mass," and Schwartz's "Godspell." He also rose to become musical director in some musicals such as "The King and I," "The Great White Way," and "West Side Story." As an operatic baritone, he played the role of Mercutio in Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet" and the lead role in "Eugene Onegin."
He is married to the former Maria Divina Amor Pascual (Amy) who is the Administrative Director of Timothy Leadership Training Institute based in Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.A. They have three children: Katrina Rachel, a former English teacher, and works currently as a writer and book editor in Manila (Philippines); Paolo Emmanuel, an environmental graphic arts designer based in Calgary, Alberta (Canada); and Jerome David, a Civil and Environmental Engineering major at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan (U.S.A.). His only grandchild, Lucia, is daughter to Katrina.
Navarro is more popularly known as the former conductor of the Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club. Under his direction, the group gave acclaimed performances in international events, won top prizes in prestigious international choral competitions, and participated in the 2001 European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.
Joel Navarro moved to the United States of America in 2001 to do his doctoral studies in music conducting at Michigan State University. He was subsequently hired by Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2002. He became tenured in 2007, and was promoted to full professor in September 2012. Concurrent with his teaching post at the College, he served part-time as Music Minister at Hope Reformed Church, Grand Rapids from 2002-2008. He serves part-time as Music Minister of the Basic English Service at Church of the Servant Christian Reformed Church, Grand Rapids.
He specializes in contemporary choral music, but is equally comfortable in music of many epochs. An active performer of music from different eras and ethnic traditions, he takes an ardent interest in post-modern music, Southeast Asian music traditions, and global hymnody.
Early Life and Education.
Joel Navarro's training as a choral artist began in his grade school years when he sang as a choir boy, first with Prof. Flora Zarco Rivera, who conducted his grade school choir; and then with Dr. Romulo Pizaña, his maternal uncle, who conducted his church choir. He attributes his musical inclinations to the nurture of very musical parents and relatives who were members of the church choir.
As a person of faith, he remembers his childhood days when his relatives would often gather to discuss and debate theological issues at the dinner table. He became interested in theology and the intersection of faith and music as a young boy. He became involved with the Inter-School Christian Fellowship, the high school ministry of Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, as the president of his high school chapter. He considers Filipino theologian and pastor emeritus Rev. Dr. Isabelo F. Magalit and Filipino cultural anthropologist Dr. Melba Maggay as his early mentors in his Christian faith.
Admitted to the highly-prestigious Philippine Science High School on full scholarship, he was one of highly gifted young students groomed to be future scientists in the Philippines. Upon graduation from high school in 1971, he took up B.S. Mathematics at the University of the Philippines. There he became heavily involved with choral singing and became soloist, section leader, and choir board member of the University of the Philippines Concert Chorus, then under the direction of Prof. Reynaldo T. Paguio, a protege of Lloyd Pfautsch of Southern Methodist University, and a former Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Music.
Tragedy struck in his family in February 1974 when his younger brother, Jerry, died at the age of 18. To help the family heal from the emotional trauma, his family moved to Bacolod City in southern Philippines. Finding a second home in the friendly airs and artistic endeavors of that city, Joel continued his studies at the University of St. La Salle. There he met Peque Gallaga and joined his theater group, Maskara. Navarro appeared in the lead role as Francisco Pizarro in the Peter Shaffer play "The Royal Hunt of the Sun" which Gallaga directed. The play was entered as the university's entry to the Iloilo Drama Association drama competition. That play won 1st prize in all categories, including Best Actor for Navarro, except for Best Female Actor simply because there were no female speaking lines in the play.
Navarro finished a Bachelor degree in Mathematics from the University of St. La Salle, Bacolod in 1976. He had a brief stint in Bacolod working as Research Associate at the Sugar Industry Foundation and as Math instructor at the University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos. Navarro then returned to Manila in 1977 and entered the graduate program in Mathematics at the Ateneo de Manila University as a scholar of the Fund Assistance to Private Education. He became involved with the Ateneo College Glee Club, then conducted by the great Filipino tenor, Noel Velasco. He was then invited to become Velasco's successor when Velasco left for Boston in 1979 to pursue a voice scholarship. While conducting the Glee Club, Navarro pursued a B.M. in Choral Conducting at nearby University of the Philippines College of Music in 1979. There he studied under Reynaldo Paguio and Francisco Feliciano, and earning his Bachelor of Music (1985) and Master of Music (1993) degrees in Choral Conducting. Paguio was his college conductor at the University of the Philippine Concert Chorus. Feliciano was his composition and theory professor, and later became his administrator when Navarro joined the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music from 1989-1995. He earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Conducting at Michigan State University in 2005, studying with Drs. Charles H. Smith, Jonathan Reed, and David Rayl. His doctoral dissertation was "A Style Study of Selected Choral Works of Ramon Pagayon Santos." Prior to his move to the U.S., he took intensive conducting classes under renowned German pedagogue Martin Behrmann.

Ruth Mott

Ruth Mott (5 February 1917 – 28 July 2012) was an English domestic servant who became a television cook and personality. Mott spent most of her life working in country houses with her television work not beginning until the age of 70 when her knowledge of a working Victorian kitchen was utilized for the television show "The Victorian Kitchen".
Personal history.
Mott was born Ruth Pizzey in Yattendon in Berkshire, England in 1917 to Alfred Pizzey, a gardener. As a child she attended the local school, which was designed by the English architect Alfred Waterhouse. When she left school, at the age of 14, she became a kitchen and scullery maid for the Manor House, owned by the Waterhouse family. Mott was part of a staff of eight, with a wage of £1 and 5 shillings a month. A year later, in 1932, staff cuts saw Mott leaving the employment of the Waterhouse family, finding alternative work in nearby Frilsham House. In 1936 she moved again, this time to Lavington Park in Sussex, before circumstances saw her take up employment for Countess Iveagh at Elveden Hall in Thetford.
In 1941, Mott took work at a house in Ashampstead to be closer to her parents' home in Yattendon, both of them now suffering from ill health. In 1942 she married Bill Mott, who she had known since her teen years. Bill was serving in the British Army at the time, and they were married in front of a small congregation in the local church. They moved in with her parents to take care of them and Mott took a job collecting insurance premiums for the Prudential. When her daughter, Bertha, was born, Mott became a housewife, only returning to employment in 1957 when Bertha was in school. Mott took an office job in the day, and catered for local functions in her free time. Bill died in 1959. Mott continued in her catering and office work until 1970 when she was offered a full-time role as cook-housekeeper at Basildon Park near Pangbourne for Lord and Lady Iliffe.
Mott continued to work full-time at Basildon Park until 1987 when she was 70, though she did casual work for the household after this date. She died on 28 July 2012 and was survived by her daughter.
Television career.
At the age of 70, Mott replied to an appeal, printed in the Women's Institute journal "Home and Country", for women who had worked in country houses before the Second World War, especially those who had experience of Victorian methods of cooking. Mott described the methods she once utilized, such as plucking birds, skinning hares and using coal-range roasting spits, and was approached by the BBC. The BBC wished to build on the success of the television show "The Victorian Kitchen Garden", which explored how a country garden would be run during Victorian Britain. The second series was called "The Victorian Kitchen", and this explored how the produce grown in the garden, by series gardener Harry Dodson, would be cooked using Victorian methods.
Mott underwent auditions for the role as the head cook and was successful. She was joined on the show by Alison Arnison, who took on the duties of Mott's kitchen maid. With no script and using turns of phrase, Mott spoke to the camera describing bygone methods of preparing and cooking food. She was a success with the viewers, who took to her stories and personality, and the fact that Mott, with her ample figure, strong Berkshire accent and capable abilities epitomised the positive stereotype of a county cook. Mott then found herself in demand with Britain's most popular chat shows and her fame spread when the television series was shown abroad. Mott contributed for a book accompanying the series, and in 1990 followed this up with her own book, "Ruth Motts' Favourite Recipes". Mott returned to the BBC in 1993, becoming the "wartime" cook in "The Wartime Kitchen and Garden". Mott's reputation as a historical cook resulted in her taking on the role as a consultant for Robert Altman's 2001 film "Gosford Park".

The Buddy Project

The Buddy Project is an Indian television series that airs Monday to Friday on Channel V India. It is currently ranked as the number one show on the channel.
Overview.
The show is set at "The Royal Academy", a once prestigious school that has had its image tarnished by its current batch of students especially by the eight protagonists. A fascinating story depicting the journey of eight distinct students explores the rebellious and vulnerable nature of each of the characters. Unfortunately, the only person who realizes the predicament of the students is Principal Ramanujam. In an attempt to regain the lost pride of T.R.A. and to help direct the enrolled students toward constructive personal and academic development, he brings in an old alumnus – Anirudh Jaitley (Manav Gohil). The story unfolds as Jaitley endeavours to help the students learn more about themselves and be comfortable in their own skin. In the process of helping students discover themselves, Jaitley rediscovers his own youthful exuberance. The underlying theme of the show is that life will always send us an "indicator". Someone or something that makes us realise who we really are and what we are actually capable of achieving. The teachers whom we criticize so much, help us out.
The second season of The Buddy Project (Now In College) has started from 18 March 2013. The show will now focus on how KD (Fahad Ali), Ranveer (Kunal Jaisingh), Kiya (Bharti Kumar), Piddi (Nikhil Mehta) and Panchi (Palak Jain) are going to adjust in the Imperial College of Communication after coming out from their comfort zone in Royal Academy.

Patrick H. Kelly

Patrick H. Kelly (June 13, 1890 - ?) was an American carpenter, general contractor and educator who served two two-year terms as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Background.
Kelly was born June 13, 1890 in Chicago, and grew up in Cassville, Wisconsin, attending Cassville High School and Middle School. He worked variously as a carpenter, foreman in an automobile factory, superintendent and principal of a mechanical school in Minneapolis, private detective, and cabinetmaker, before going into business as a general contractor in 1953.
Elective office.
Except for serving on his local draft board in 1938, Kelly held no public office before being elected to the Assembly's Milwaukee County 10th district (the 10th Ward of the City of Milwaukee) in 1958. He challenged eight-term incumbent Democrat Michael F. O'Connell, and defeated him in the Democratic primary by eight votes (737 to 729) in a three-way race. In the general election, facing Republican Herbert Warren Smith as well as O'Connell (now running as an independent), he won with 3997 votes, to 2067 for Smith and 635 for O'Connell. He was assigned to the standing committees on insurance and banking; on taxation; and on third reading.
In 1962, Kelly was himself defeated in a six-way Democratic primary, coming in second to 20-year-old college student Fred Kessler, who took a plurality with 38% of the vote, and went on to defeat Republican Herbert Smith in the general election.
In 1964, Kelly regained his old seat (Kessler was pursuing an unsuccessful run for the Wisconsin State Senate), winning a plurality in a four-way Democratic primary, and defeating Republican Daniel Dawson 3813 to 2185. He was assigned to the same standing committees as in his prior term.
In 1966, Kessler (who had earned a B.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked with Governor John W. Reynolds, Jr.'s staff on reapportionment litigation) again unseated Kelly, taking an absolute majority in a five-way Democratic primary: Kelly came in third.

Command &amp; Conquer (2013 video game)

Command & Conquer (previously known as Command & Conquer: Generals 2) is a cancelled real-time strategy video game in the "Command & Conquer" series. It was being developed by the now-closed video game studio Victory Games for Microsoft Windows. The game was set to use the Frostbite 3 engine and would have introduced downloadable content to the series. It was supposed to be the first game in the series to be developed by Victory Games, making them the series' third developer after Westwood Studios and EA Los Angeles. "Command & Conquer" would have been available exclusively on Electronic Arts' Origin distribution service. 
The game was originally announced as "Command & Conquer: Generals 2", a direct sequel to 2003's "." It was re-purposed as what would have been the first in a series of free-to-play games set in the "Command & Conquer" universe. The skirmish multiplayer platform was slated for release for free around Christmas 2013, with 'pay per play' campaign missions releasing by Q1 2014. However, on October 29, 2013, EA ceased development of "Command & Conquer" and shut down Victory Games, citing negative feedback over the economy-based experience as a reason.
Gameplay.
Previously, "" drastically changed the original game's formula in certain areas, such as the removal of base building and the addition of population caps (changes which were poorly received.) Command & Conquer (2013) would have returned to its original roots. Along with classic staples such as base building and resource collection, there would have been the usual amounts of orchestrating and commanding large armies.
Factions.
The game would have featured three unique factions: European Union (EU), Global Liberation Army (GLA) and Asian-Pacific Alliance (APA).
Development.
As "Generals 2".
After the release of "", much of the "Command & Conquer" team, within EA Los Angeles, was laid off in 2010 causing the future of the series to be cast in doubt. In October 2010, a senior vice-president from Electronic Arts had told the media that the "Command & Conquer" series would live on as a brand from "Dead Space" developers, Visceral Games, with a title from the series to be released by that developer being "far-off" and whether or not he was referring to this game is not clear.
The first official announcement of a new "Command & Conquer" game in development, came in February 2011 when Electronic Arts announced the formation of a new studio known as Victory Games. In the studios' first Q&A session with the official "Command & Conquer" blog, openly announced that they were developing a new title in the "Command & Conquer" series with the studios' general focus being on the future of the series. The new studio consisted of members from the previous EA Los Angeles development team as well as some new staff members.
The game's formal announcement was then teased as a game from the "next big BioWare franchise" and was due for a reveal at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards. The game was then speculated to be either a new game from defunct studio, Pandemic's "Mercenaries" series, or a new game from the "Command & Conquer" series, which turned out to be an accurate analysis. Subsequently, more rumors began to indicate that the game was indeed a "Command & Conquer" game called, "Command & Conquer: Alliances" due to a series of domain registrations by EA for a game of that name, though this turned out to be a side project by Phenomic, called "". The game was finally formally unveiled as "Command & Conquer: Generals 2" on December 10, 2011 at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards as a title developed by what would become BioWare Victory. However, in November 2012, the BioWare label was dropped and the studio was renamed to its former name Victory Games.
Change to free-to-play model.
On August 15, 2012, it was announced that "Generals 2" would be repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply "Command & Conquer". The official website also released a blog entry that said that the "Command & Conquer: Generals 2" game would be called "Command & Conquer". The content which has been built for "Generals 2" would be delivered into the new "C&C" game.
Following the negative reaction from series fans that "Command & Conquer" would not have a single-player campaign, EA President Frank Gibeau stated that a single-player storyline would still be a possibility. "The beauty of free-to-play is that we can adjust and adapt to what we're hearing as opposed to, 'I'm sorry, it's two months from ship and it is what it is.' It's a very different model because you don't have to build as much. You build in response to your audience." It was later revealed that the game would have a single-player campaign.
Promotion and cancellation.
From then on, news of the upcoming game was relatively quiet. In mid-December 2012 Victory Games hosted a C&C Community Summit where select members were invited and given the chance to play the game and share feedback with the developers. It was later on that Victory Games announced the third faction as the Asian-Pacific Alliance. In May EA released a development video diary stating the developers' intention to constantly improve on the final product based on the players' feedback. At E3 2013, EA released a new trailer of the game as well as the beta going live in the summer. On August 5, 2013, a second development video diary was released showing the design process of modifying the GLA Bomb Truck unit from "Command & Conquer: Generals" into the GLA Nuke Truck. Victory Games also released wallpapers of the generals of each faction, starting with the APA generals and later the EU and GLA within a few days of each other.
Both EA and Victory Games stated that "Command and Conquer" would be showcased at Cologne's Gamescom 2013. In addition to the press conference, a trailer revealed that campaign missions were to be made available in 2014. The game has been canceled as of October 29, 2013 due to negative fan feedback over an economy-based, multiplayer experience. The cancellation statement released by the company cited multiplayer for "Command & Conquer" being its downfall.
Resurrection.
In November 2013, EA announced the game will still be developed by a new game studio, and customers who bought the Command & Conquer Ultimate Collection will still receive an invite to the Beta. EA is currently looking for the new developer of the reboot.

ABU Song Festivals

ABU Song Festivals are annual song competitions based on the Eurovision Song Contest. The format consists of two shows, a Radio Song Festival and TV Song Festival, organised by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU).
Participating countries which have full or additional full ABU membership are invited to submit a song to be performed in front of a live audience. The radio festival is a competitive show with a panel of judges determining the top-5 prize winners, and is broadcast via live radio. The television festival which is a non-competitive, musical gala presentation, is live recorded so that each of the national broadcasters may add subtitles in their native languages.
History.
Our Sound - The Asia-Pacific Song Contest.
In 2008, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) proposed a partnership with ABU on the establishment of an "Asiavision Song Contest", however these talks didn't produce any result, and in September 2008 it was announced that the Eurovision Song Contest format for Asian production had been sold to a private company from Singapore, Asiavision Pte. Ltd. The original name intended for that event was "Asiavision Song Contest", but it was later changed to "Our Sound - The Asia-Pacific Song Contest" following a request from the ABU, who uses the Asiavision name for their news exchange service. Initially, the contest (which was supposed to be a two program live broadcast TV show with public voting) was set to premiere in 2009, but it was later rescheduled for March 2010 in Macao and then for November 2010 in Mumbai, at the end being postponed indefinitely "due to the ongoing issues between the organizers and EBU".
Development.
The Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had already ran an international song contest for its members inspired by the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 – 1987, called the "ABU Popular Song Contest", with 14 countries of the Asia-Pacific region competing. The show had a similar concept to the current radio song festival with winners being chosen by a professional jury. South Korea, New Zealand and Australia celebrated victories in this competition. In 1989 – 1991 ABU co-produced the "ABU Golden Kite World Song Festival" in Malaysia with participation of Asia-Pacific countries, as well as Yugoslavia and Finland.
Shortly before launching the ABU Song Festival, the ABU had been considering the possibility to organize the "ABU ASEAN TV Song Festival" in Thailand. Historically, ASEAN song contests had been organized in periods between 1981 and 1997, however since 2011 the ASEAN Festival had been organized between local Radio stations as "Bintang Radio ASEAN". ABU outlined a plan about a "television song festival" based on the style of the Eurovision Song Contest following the cancellation of "Our Sound". Kenny Kihyung Bae, chosen to the project manager, attended Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan to learn more about the contest before putting it to work.
In November 2011, the ABU announced that they would organize its own TV and Radio Song Festivals to take place in Seoul, the South Korean capital, in time with 49th General Assembly in October 2012. The name "Asiavision Song Contest" was initially mentioned as a possibility, but they were later officially titled "ABU TV Song Festival" and "ABU Radio Song Festival". According to the ABU, the deadline for participation applications for ABU TV Song Festival 2012 was 18 May 2012.
Format.
Andreas Gerlach, CEO of Asiavision Pte. Ltd, stated that ""the format is highly suited to the Asia region and its people who love popular music and have a strong national pride. Asia today is all about competition, economically and politically. The Song Contest is a friendly competition between cultures. Like in Europe, the universal language of music will help to bring people closer together and nurture mutual understanding in the region.""
The contests are divided into two versions, ABU Radio Song Festival and ABU TV Song Festival. Twenty-six songs from sixteen nations competed at the Radio Song Festival, held in the South Korean capital, Seoul on 14 October 2012, while seven nations competed in the ABU TV Song Festival.
Contests.
ABU Radio Song Festival.
The ABU Radio Song Festival is a competition for musicians, who are not under contract with any label. The ABU recommends its members to introduce participating musicians and their songs on radio. Every participant is chosen by one national radio broadcaster. A jury represented by ABU members choses 15 finalists from 26 submissions. The finalists perform during the general assembly of the ABU. Another jury awards the best artists.
ABU TV Song Festival.
The ABU TV Song Festival is a concert performance for professional musicians, who according to the organiser are well known in their country of origin. The event is not meant to be competitive. The festival will be recorded and is meant to be broadcast by participating ABU members first. Non-participating ABU members and non-ABU member broadcasters will be allowed to broadcast the festival for a fee at a later stage. Every musician will be selected by a national broadcaster being member of the ABU. The participants perform during the general assembly of the ABU. At a press conference held on 18 July 2013 it was announced that Indonesia were submitting a bid to host the ABU TV Song Festival 2015. In recent editions, the TV Festival has been held in the host city of the ABU General Assembly, with Istanbul, Turkey playing host to such assembly in 2015. If the bid were to be successful it would be the first time that the TV Festival has taken place away from the host country of the General Assembly.

In 1976, the couple had developed a serious rift in their marriage. Their reasons were kept private but friends believe it could have been due to Navin's slipping career.

Toli (shamanism)

A toli is a round, ritual mirror used in Shamanism in some parts of Mongolia and in the Republic of Buryatia. The mirror, ornamented on one side and polished on the other, may be made of bronze, brass or copper.
Toli are traditionally worn as part of a shaman's attire around the shaman's neck or in quantity on the shaman's kaftan or apron, to help ward off evil spirits and to signify the shaman's authority. They may have additional purposes as well. Among the Daur people, they were also used to purify water, to collect spirits or spiritual manifestations like the magic of the sun or moon and to divine the prognosis of a sick patient. Walther Heissig, describing shamans and their incantations in Hure Banner in the 1940s, remarks that one shamaness indicated that the toli contained "the white horses of the shamans"; the mirror itself was seen as a vehicle for the shamans.
Toli may be used in different sizes; among the Daur, the front and back of the shaman's costume was covered with small toli placed like overlapping scales while the front might also feature eight large mirrors and one medium-sized mirror to protect the heart, the "neker-toli"; according to Heissig, in Hure Banner shamans wore nine mirrors, nine being a particularly meaningful number in Mongolian religion and mythology. The neker-toli might be plated in nickel. The number of toli collected by the Daur shaman was an indicator of his or her level of power.

Bethel Inn Resort

The Bethel Inn Resort is a four-season resort located on the village common of Bethel, Maine with an 18-hole golf course and small convention center.
History.
In 1911, Bethel's Prospect Hotel, which provided lodging for many of Dr. John George Gehring's out patients, was severely damaged by fire. After a plan to rebuild it failed, five of Dr. Gehring's grateful patients included him in a partnership to construct the Bethel Inn so that people coming to see him for treatment would always have a place to stay. The Inn opened its doors to the public in 1913.
Through the forties and fifties, the Inn thrived. But by the 1960s, survival became nearly impossible with the changing vacationing habits of the modern traveler. The Inn struggled mightily under a succession of owners until February 28, 1979 when it closed its doors. On May 22, 1979, Richard D. Rasor purchased the Bethel Inn. In 1986, the business underwent a $7,500,000 expansion project, funded primarily by the sale of 40 new condominiums, in order to finance a conference center and health club.
Present day.
The Bethel Inn encompasses 200 acres, 158 guest rooms, an 18 hole, 6663 yard, par 72 course golf course, conference center, health club and swimming pool, dining rooms, lake house, and cross-country ski trails.

John Gerzema

John Gerzema is an American writer and corporate consultant, and the executive chairman of Burson Marsteller’s BAV Consulting, a global consultancy that advises corporations, nongovernmental organizations and governments on how to increase their value by strengthening their brands. BAV also owns and manages the BrandAsset Valuator database, the world's largest study on brands. Gerzema has been described as a “marketing guru,” and his analysis of consumer behavior has been widely cited in such publications as The Harvard Business Review, Strategy & Business, The Journal of Consumer Psychology and the Marketing Management textbook. He is frequently cited in discussions about the rise of feminine values in leadership.
Education.
Gerzema received a bachelor’s degree in marketing from The Ohio State University in 1983 and his master’s degree in Integrated Marketing from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 1987.
Book Author.
"The Brand Bubble"
Gerzema is the author of two best-selling books. His first book, The Brand Bubble: The Looming Crisis in Brand Value and How to Avoid It (John Wiley & Sons, Oct. 13, 2008), written with Ed Lebar, identified the beginning of changes in consumer attitudes that preceded the financial crisis. It was listed as a Bloomberg Businessweek best-seller in 2008 and as one of Books You Should Have Read in Ad Week. 
The Brand Bubble also was honored with a WPP Atticus Award in 2008.
"Spend Shift"
Gerzema’s book, Spend Shift: How the Post-Crisis Values Revolution Is Changing the Way We Buy, Sell and Live (Jossey-Bass, Oct 18, 2010), written with Pulitzer-Prize winner Michael D’Antonio, explored consumerism after the Great Recession. Making the best-seller list of The Wall Street Journal, which said the book offers "10 'take-aways' spelling out the traits of the new America that the authors envision. It's a handy list for marketers and business managers," Spend Shift also appeared on the best-seller list of The Washington Post, which called it “a timely look at how the economic malaise has affected how and what consumers buy,” and was one of Fast Company's Best Business Books of 2010, as well as Book of the Week from the WEEK Magazine.
"The Athena Doctrine"
Gerzema’s book, “The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The World,” also written with D’Antonio, was published in April 2013. The book explores the rise of feminine traits and values in society, leadership, and business.
Gerzema spoke about his research at a TEDx event in August 2012 and at the TEDxWomen event in December 2012. 
Speaking at a conference in India in June 2012, Gerzema said that according to the writers' research, 53 percent of adults in India believed that if men think like women, the world "would be a better place." In their research of more than 60,000 people in 13 countries, the authors found that “traditionally feminine leadership and values are now more popular than the macho paradigm of the past.” The authors found that “people are frustrated by a world long dominated by codes of male thinking and behavior: Codes of control, aggression and black-and-white thinking that have contributed to many of the problems we face today, from wars and income inequality to reckless risk-taking and scandal. 
“In fact, two-thirds of people feel the world would be a better place if men thought more like women-including 79 per cent of Japanese men; 76 per cent of French and Brazilians and 70 per cent of Germans.”
USA Today said the book provides "a captivating look at how individuals, regardless of gender and ethnicity, view behaviors as masculine, feminine, or neutral. A fascinating case study of human nature, this book provides insight into future world leaders."
Writing in Strategy+Business, Sally Helgensen said, “the concept of making something bad a little better rather than seeking one heroic solution seems to define the essence of The Athena Doctrine and is indeed demonstrative of a less arrogant and elite-centric leadership model than the usual.”
Proceeds from the book benefit the United Nations Foundation’s Girl Up campaign.
The Athena Doctrine has appeared on the best seller lists of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly, Chicago Tribune and USA Today
Columnist.
Gerzema writes regular columns for the Huffington Post, The Economist Blog, Google Think Quarterly, Inc. (magazine) and PSFK. His Trend Watcher column for Inc. has dealt with such topics as Reshaping the World of Retail and The Geeks Are Graying. 
His PSFK columns, such as “Of Tea and Carrotmobs,” and “Everyone Needs an Alice,” focus on entrepreneurs and successful small businesses. His article "The Trouble With Brands" was named as one of "The Fifty Classic Management Articles" by the Strategy & Business editors.
Thought Leader.
Gerzema’s extensive research and writing has garnered praise from The Wall Street Journal, NPR, Huffington Post, Forbes, Financial Times, Harvard Business Review, USA Today and CBS Sunday Morning News. Fast Company has noted his insights as “the future of commerce,” while CNBC credits his understanding of new marketplace trends as “a new revolution.”
The Boston Globe says Gerzema "breaks trends down to a very relatable, human scale while providing a heavy dose of education.” U.S News & World Report describes his thinking as backed by “heavy duty consumer research.”
Gerzema appeared at the DLDwomen 13 Breaking New Ground conference in July 2013.
Gerzema frequently lectures on trends, innovation, and culture. He gave the keynote presentation at The Economist Marketing Forum on avoiding the looming crisis in brand value. At The Drucker Business Forum he talked with Strategy & Business Editor Art Kleiner on the New Rules for Consumerism.

The Ides of April

The Ides of April is a 2013 historical crime novel by Lindsey Davis. It is set in ancient Rome, and its central character is Flavia Albia, British-born adopted daughter of Marcus Didius Falco, the hero of the author's 20-volume Falco series, published from 1989 to 2010. Flavia Albia is a 28-year-old widowed "informer", a detective, like her father. 
The book is set in March and April AD 89, in the Aventine Hill area of Rome.
The front cover image is of a small glass pot and a needle dipped in blood. It carries the strapline "Falco: The New Generation".
The book is written in the first person, from Flavia Albia's point of view. 
Connections to the Falco series.
Falco and his partner Helena are included in the "Cast list" in the book, and Flavia Albia describes them and their household and visits them during the course of the story, but they do not appear directly in the text. Helena's two brothers are mentioned as being lawyers. Falco's old friend Petro is not mentioned in the cast list, but is referred to as Flavia Albia's "uncle" in the text. 
Falco's young brother Postumus, the result of Thalia's pregnancy in "Nemesis", is now an awkward eleven-year-old, who appears in the book.
Flavia Albia uses Falco's old apartment in Fountain Court as her office, and lives elsewhere in the same building.
Reception.
The "Irish Times" reviewer said: "Irreverent, resourceful and hard-boiled in her patter, Flavia is a heroine to rival her contemporary counterparts VI Warshawski and Kinsey Milhone." Tom Holland reviewed the book for "The Guardian" and ended:

Bad Education (TV series)

Bad Education is a British sitcom produced by Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC Three. It stars Jack Whitehall as young teacher Alfie Wickers – "the worst teacher ever to grace the British education system" – at the fictional Abbey Grove School, in Watford, Hertfordshire. Mathew Horne plays Fraser, the headmaster of the fictional school alongside him.
At the time of the series launch it broke BBC Three's record for the highest-rated first episode of a comedy, which was previously held by "Horne & Corden", but is now held by "Cuckoo". The second series premiered on BBC iPlayer on 27 August 2013, a week before the television air date of 3 September, as part of BBC Three's plans to premiere all its scripted comedy programmes online. This experiment proved successful, as the first episode of the second series received 1.5 million requests prior to its television airing. A Christmas special aired on 17 December 2013.
On 11th June 2014, Jack Whitehall announced via his Twitter account that the third series had gone into production for broadcast at the end of 2014. 
Synopsis.
The series focuses on Alfie Wickers (Whitehall), a posh, newly graduated secondary school history teacher at the fictional Abbey Grove School, in or near Watford, Hertfordshire.
Ever determined to impress his crush, Rosie Gulliver (Solemani), Wickers makes repeated efforts to appear "cool", such as coaching the school football team, organising a weapons amnesty and fielding a candidate for the school elections. Usually, in these efforts, he will turn to his class (particularly Joe, the "teacher's pet"), despite their open disrespect for him, for help.
At the same time, Wickers finds himself having to deal with the shenanigans of his eccentric headmaster, Shaquille "Simon" Fraser (Horne) and meet the expectations of his deputy headmistress, Professor Celia Green (Spiro), and her predecessor, Isobel Pickwell (Gomez).
Production.
On 23 August 2012, it was announced that "Bad Education" would have a second series. The second series began airing on BBC Three on 3 September 2013. Part of the second series has been filmed at St. Michael's Catholic High School, Finchley, London.

Scenes were also filmed at the former Salesian College in Battersea, South West London. 
Episode list.
Series 3 (2014).
On 11th June 2014, Jack Whitehall announced that the third series of "Bad Education" had gone into production and is expected to be broadcast at the end of 2014. 
American adaptation.
A pilot for a U.S. adaptation of "Bad Education", named "An American Education", was ordered by ABC with Whitehall set to reprise his role as Alfie Wickers. The pilot began filming in Los Angeles in January 2014. However, ABC passed on the pilot on 22 May 2014, but Whitehall will continue with the original UK series of the show.
Reception.
The series received generally positive reviews from the British press. "Time Out" compared it to "Green Wing", saying it made use of "comedy staples" and deeming it "one of the best comedies BBC3 has ever screened", while "Metro" said it was a "buzzing new sitcom". However "The Guardian" called it "in poor taste" and accused Whitehall of "phoning it in". The show currently holds a 7.8 out of 10 rating on IMDb from its users.

The first series of "Bad Education" was released on DVD on 9 September 2013.
The second series DVD release is yet to be announced.

Montreal Children's Library

The Montreal Children's Library () is a public library and nonprofit organization in Montreal, Quebec.
History.
Montreal Children's Library was founded in 1929. It was the first free children's library for both English and French-speaking children in Montreal. The initiator of the Montreal movement for a children’s library was Elizabeth Murray, who came from a family with a long tradition of public service and the belief that every child should have the same opportunity to grow up with books, that she herself had enjoyed. When she discovered that the librarian of the Fraser Institute, M. de Crèvecoeur, had set apart a section for children’s reading but lacked the funds to purchase books for it, Miss Murray got in contact with the Local Council (later the Montreal Council of Women), which had formed a committee to inquire into the possibility of establishing a children’s library, under the chairmanship of Maysie McSporran. The committee obtained $3000 in a fund raising campaign, and in October 1929 the room in the Fraser Institute was opened for all girls and boys between the ages of three and sixteen. During its first month of operation, under librarian Violet McEwen, membership grew to 208 children.
Today, the Montreal Children's Library has over 4000 members and circulates almost 30,000 items a year.
Activities.
The Montreal Children's Library offers a variety of activities at each of its three branches, including parent-child story time, craft-making, reading circles and group activities such as a chess club.
The library's programs and activities are all free and are targeted at children ranging from 0-10 years of age.
In addition to its various in-house activities, the Montreal Children's Library engages in a wide range of outreach projects.
Branches.
The Montreal Children's Library is composed of three branches.

Ron Fowler

Ronald L Fowler (born 1943/1944) is the executive chairman of the ownership group of the San Diego Padres franchise in Major League Baseball (MLB). He also serves as the CEO of Liquid Investments Incorporated, a San Diego beer distributorship. 
San Diego Padres.
Fowler was a member of a minority group that owned 49.32 percent of the Padres. The group, headed by then-Padres chief executive Jeff Moorad, attempted to buy the Padres from controlling owner John Moores for $530 million, but the deal fell through in April 2012. Fowler then replaced Moorad as the general partner of the minority group, and he served on the Padres executive committee.
Fowler joined a new group to purchase the Padres that included four heirs to the O’Malley family—who owned the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise for five decades. Kevin and Brian O'Malley are the sons of former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley and grandsons of Walter O'Malley, the owner who moved the Dodgers west from Brooklyn after the 1957 season. Peter and Tom Seidler are the nephews of Peter O’Malley. MLB approved the $800 million sale, which completed on August 28, 2012. As much as $200 million of the sale price included the team's 20-percent stake in Fox Sports San Diego, a cable channel that pays the Padres annual fees as part of a $1.2 billion, 20-year agreement. Fowler was named the ownership group's executive chairman and was designated to represent the Padres in all league meetings. He became the first locally based control person of the team since founding owner C. Arnholdt Smith.
Liquid Investments.
Fowler is the chairman and CEO of privately held Liquid Investments Inc., the parent company of operating entities in California and Colorado. The investment group distributes Miller, Coors, Heineken and other beer brands and has annual sales exceeding $220 million.
Other interests.
Fowler owned the San Diego Sockers, an indoor soccer team that won 10 championships in 11 years. He also chaired San Diego's first task force that selected a site for what was eventually Petco Park, and he chaired the host committee for Super Bowl XXXVII held in Qualcomm Stadium in 2003.

GlobalPort Batang Pier

The GlobalPort Batang Pier is a Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) team that first played in the 2012–13 PBA season. The team took over the franchise of the Powerade Tigers in 2012 after it was sold to Sultan 900 Capital, Inc. Besides GlobalPort, team owner Mikee Romero also co-owned the AirAsia Philippine Patriots of the ASEAN Basketball League. But since the Philippine Patriots team took an indefinite leave of absence in the ABL, Romero now owns only the GlobalPort team.
History.
Sale of the Powerade franchise.
On July 30, 2012, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. announced that their PBA team, the Powerade Tigers, was sold to Sultan 900, Inc. which is owned and represented by its chairman and CEO Michael Romero. The Board of Governors unanimously approved the purchase on a special board meeting on August 17.
2012-2013 Season.
Philippine Cup.
The GlobalPort Batang Pier entered the league under the guidance of rookie head coach, Glenn Capacio, with the lineup led by Powerade carry-overs Gary David, Rabeh Al-Hussaini, Rudy Lingganay, Rey Guevarra, Jondan Salvador, Josh Vanlandingham, Will Antonio, Alex Crisano and Rommel Adducul, together with off-season trade in from Barangay Ginebra, Willie Miller (in exchange for JVee Casio), draft picks Vic Manuel, Jason Deutchman and AJ Mandani, and signed free agents Marvin Cruz, Mark Yee and Angelus Raymundo. The team finished with a disappointing 1-13 record in its maiden campaign, winning only on October 17, 2012 against Meralco.
Commissioner's Cup.
Former Barako Bull Energy Cola coach Junel Baculi was appointed as the new head coach, while Glenn Capacio stayed on the GlobalPort coaching staff as Baculi’s lead assistant. The team pulled off a major roster revamp, as the PBA approved two trades that landed previous conference's cellar dweller a major boost in the form of Sol Mercado and Japeth Aguilar, thus, forming the team's so-called MMDA (Miller, Mercado, David and Aguilar). The team acquired Mercado from the Meralco Bolts along with Kelly Nabong, Jaypee Belencion and Yousif Aljamal, in exchange for Rey Guevarra, Vic Manuel, Josh Vanlandingham and their 2015 1st-round pick, while Rabeh Al-Hussaini was traded out to Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters for Aguilar. The new Batang Pier looked promising after winning 2 of its first 3 games, but then the team lost all of its remaining games in the elimination, ending its campaign with a 2-12 record.
Governor's Cup.
On June 11, 2013, GlobalPort's MMDA was disbanded as Japeth Aguilar was traded to Barangay Ginebra for Yousef Taha and the 2013 1st round draft pick it received from Talk 'N Text. In a separate deal, the team acquired Jay Washington from Petron Blaze Boosters for Jason Deutchman and the Batang Pier’s 2016 and 2017 second round draft picks. The team ended the eliminations with a 4-5 record as Jay Washington exploded for a career-high of 30 points and led the team in a win on their final elimination assignment against Ginebra. After two consecutive conferences finishing at the bottom of the standings, the team finally lands a spot in the play-offs as they finished fifth in the eliminations. Facing the 4th-seeded Rain or Shine Elasto Painters having a twice-to-beat advantage, and as head coach Junel Baculi got ejected for a second technical foul late at the 3rd quarter, the Batang Pier lost by a single basket and got eliminated in the first game of their quarterfinals series.
2013-2014 Season.
Philippine Cup.
Before the start of the next season, the GlobalPort Batang Pier underwent another major overhaul. They let coach Junel Baculi go and appointed Richie Ticzon as new coach in an interim capacity. They've also traded away Gary David to Meralco. David was packaged by Globaport Batang Pier with rookie guard AJ Mandani and sent to Meralco for guard Chris Ross, Chris Timberlake and two future second-round draft picks. Ross was also traded away to Petron for Dennis Miranda, who was eventually traded to Barako in exchange for the 6th overall draft pick which they used to select RR Garcia. They also traded Willie Miller to Barako Bull in exchange for veteran Enrico Villanueva on draft day.
To infuse some young blood to the team, they drafted college standouts Terrence Romeo (in the expense of sending Yousef Taha to Petron), Garcia, Isaac Holstein, Nico Salva and LA Revilla, who are tasked to team up with established veterans Sol Mercado, Jay Washington, and former league MVP Eric Menk, who returned from playing in the ABL. Holstein was later traded to San Mig Super Coffee Mixers in exchange for fellow rookie Justin Chua and veteran Leo Najorda. The team also acquired Jewel Ponferada from the Mixers for a future draft pick and signed up Marvin Hayes. As a result, they are a team that is fun to watch, with Romeo's scoring prowess and Garcia's steady playmaking. They have even won their first ever winning streak since they joined the league. However, things go down the drain as they lost five straight games, only to be snapped in a win against Alaska, to keep their playoff hopes alive.
They ended their Philippine Cup elimination campaign with 5-9 win-loss record, taking the seventh place playoff spot, and were pitted against twice-to-beat Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the quarterfinal round. They were ousted by E-Painters in their lone playoff game.
Commissioner's Cup.
Prior to the start of the next conference, they have made significant changes again. Pido Jarencio takes over as the new coach, in his first pro coaching career, replacing Richie Ticzon. They have also traded away Sol Mercado for Alex Cabagnot. They sent Leo Najorda back to Barako Bull for point guard Jonas Villanueva, with Villanueva then getting conveyed to Air21 for guard Bonbon Custodio. Eric Menk was also appointed as the new captain of the team. Mark Macapagal was signed in from free agency. In the middle of the conference, big man Enrico Villanueva, who only played one game for Batang Pier, was acquired by Air21 in exchange for Ronnie Matias and Carlo Sharma. After losing their first 8 games, the Batang Pier won their last assignment against the Barako Bull to give rookie head coach Pido Jarencio his first win in the PBA. The team finished last in this conference.
Governor's Cup.
Before the Commissioner's Cup officially ended, GlobalPort pushed through their bid to acquire Yousef Taha from the San Miguel Beermen in exchange of rookie big man, Justin Chua. After playing for a few games for the Batang Pier, Taha was then shipped to the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers camp along with Ronnie Matias for center Yancy De Ocampo and sniper Val Acuña. In a separate deal, GlobalPort traded Nico Salva and Bonbon Custodio to the Barako Bull Energy to acquire Ronjay Buenafe plus a future second-round pick of the Energy. Rudy Lingganay was also reacquired after being released prior to the start of the previous conference. A repeat performance for the Batang Pier as they ended the season-ending conference with another 1-8 win-loss record.

SS Armonia (1924)

SS "Armonia" was a 2,740 GRT cargo ship built in 1924 and scrapped in 1960. In her 26-year career she had eight successive owners, managers and names. "Armonia" was her sixth name, and the one that she bore when a CIA aircraft attacked and damaged her in an air raid in Indonesia in 1958.
Owners, managers and names.
The ship was launched by Blyth Shipbuilding & Drydock Co Ltd as Tullochmoor at Blyth, Northumberland and completed in October 1924. She was owned by Moor Line and managed by Walter Runciman and Company. In 1936 she was sold to Franz L Nimitz of Stettin, Germany, who renamed her Brigitte. In May 1945 she was at Hamburg where she was seized as an Allied war prize. The UK Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) took her over, named her Empire Soar and placed her under the management of Sir Robert Ropner & Co. In 1946 she was sold to the Greek government, which renamed her Preveza. In 1948 she was sold to Synodinos Brothers of Greece who renamed her Danapris. In 1957 she was sold to A. Angelicoussis & Co of Greece who renamed her "Armonia". In 1959 she was sold to Keanyew Shipping Co who renamed her Keanyew and registered her in Panama. In 1960 she was sold to Southern Commercial Co who renamed her Charlie. Later in 1960 she was scrapped in Hong Kong.
Bombed by the CIA in 1958.
At the end of April or beginning of May 1958 "Armonia" was in Amboina Harbour in Indonesia. On 28 April a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, operated by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, bombed her. In the same attack, the same aircraft hit and sank the merchant ships and . One source asserts that all three ships were off the port of Donggala near Palu in Central Sulawesi (at least west of Ambon) when they were hit. This now appears doubtful, as "Aquila"s wreck seems to have been identified in Ambon Bay. There is also some discrepancy over the date of the attack: one source states that the three ships were bombed on 28 April; another states that "Armonia" was attacked on 1 or 2 May.

Blaze of Noon

Blaze of Noon is a 1947 film directed by John Farrow about four brothers who become involved in the early days of plane flight.
Plot Summary.
In the beginning of the 1920s, the four brothers McDonald are performing in a carnival as a stunt flying team, when they are hired by Mercury Airlines in Newark, New Jersey, to fly the national air mail.
One of the brothers, Colin (William Holden), instantly falls in love with the nurse giving him a physical, Lucille Stewart (Anne Baxter). He asks her to marry him after just one day of acquaintance and she accepts. They marry and start flying for the company along the East Coast.
Lucille soon becomes irritated by the brothers' extreme dedication to their work, but Colin promises that his efforts will make it possible for them to buy a home. When the youngest brother Keith (Johnny Sands) crashes his plane and dies, his elder brother Ronald (Sonny Tufts) quits flying and becomes a car salesman instead. He feels guilty over causing his brother's death, since he was the one who taught him to fly.
Their friend and colleague Porkie (William Bendix) is fired for flying recklessly over a passenger train. Instead he becomes a car salesman like Ronald. The next brother to crash his plane is Tad (Sterling Hayden), and even though he survives the crash, he is unable to fly again.
Colin's former girlfriend Poppy (Jean Wallace) pays him a visit and tries to win him back, but he stays true to Lucille. Soon afterwards their first child, a son, is born. Colin has promised to stop flying once he is a father, but he still continues when he is offered a raise by the company.
During Colin's first passenger flight, the wings are iced over and he crashes and dies. His boss and Tad are the ones who bring the news of his death home to Lucille, when she is hosting their housewarming party. Lucille decides to name her son Keith.

California (1947 film)

California is a 1947 western film directed by John Farrow and featuring Ray Milland, Barbara Stanwyck and Barry Fitzgerald.
Plot.
A deserter who had been an Army lieutenant, Jonathan Trumbo is hired to guide a wagon train bound for California during the gold rush. When a woman named Lily Bishop is accused of cheating at poker in a saloon, farmer Michael Fabian invites her to join the wagon train over Trumbo's strenuous objections. Trumbo, too, accuses of her of cheating at cards after losing to Lily, an insult she promises not to forget. Lily leaves with Booth Pennock, a ruffian who injures Trumbo with a whip before departing. Lily ends up in Pharoah City, running a saloon. The town is controlled by Pharoah Coffin, a former slave trader who opposes the law and order of California approving statehood. Trumbo turns up and gets involved in a saloon brawl. Lily orders him never to set foot there again, but Trumbo wins the place in a poker game. She mistakenly takes Pharoah to be an honest man and moves onto his hacienda. Coffin's men beat up Trumbo, who is rescued on the trail by Mexicans and vows revenge. When his wounds heal, Trumbo returns and becomes a spokesman for statehood advocacy. Coffin's hired men kill Fabian for similar beliefs, causing Lily to finally see Coffin for the crazed villain he is. Trumbo forms a posse and corners Coffin, who is descending into madness. Lily shoots him. Trumbo, in love with Lily, promises to return to the Army to atone for his desertion, hoping someday to return to her.

411 PAIN

The company 411 PAIN or 411-PAIN, formally 1-800-411-PAIN, is an American medical and lawyer referral service, which specializes in accident injury information services. The firm, based in Miami, Florida, was established in 1996 by chiropractor Dr. Robert Lewin. The "Florida Trend" cites the firm as one of Florida's larger for-profit lawyer referral services, and "Biotech Week" cites the company as one of America's "leading treatment and lawyer referral resources for people injured in auto accidents."
Background and trademark.
The company was established in Florida in 1996 by chiropractor Dr. Robert Lewin. In a 2010 United States District Court Southern District of Florida case it states that they provide "assistance to victims of motor vehicle, slip and fall,work-related, and recreational accidents seeking medical, chiropractic and therapeutic care and legal advice by referring them to doctors and other health care professionals, scheduling appointments, and referring victims seeking legal advice to local attorneys."
In advertising, the company is known for its phrase, "After 911, Call 411, 1-800-411-PAIN." Their radio and television-based commercials usually feature actors portraying police officers or emergency workers urging motor accident victims to contact both a lawyer and doctor as soon as possible after the crash after calling 911. In 2011, the firm introduced an iPhone application which provides accident victims with the opportunity to "catalog and report an accident to 411 PAIN, including pictures of the vehicles involved, photos of drivers' licenses, insurance cards and license plates, and record any bodily pain you have."
Humanitarian issues.
The firm has been involved in numerous charitable schemes, especially in education. They have been involved in the Read and Rise program in low income schools in both Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, donating $60,000 to the cause. They also funded $60,000 for what is known as the 411 Pain Cash for Teachers Contest, which "awards $1,000 per month to a teacher in each county, culminating with a May grand prize of $11,000 for each district." In March 2011 they donated $2,120 to Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho and Martha Harris, principal of Dr. Henry W. Mack Elementary School in Miami to fund a Scholastic Book Fair in which $5 gift certificates were given to children to buy books of their choice. The firm also organizes the 411 Pain Bowl between schools in southern Florida and is also active in the campaign against bullying in schools and sponsors The Prevention Team, an anti-bullying organization. On September 29 2011, the company along with Romance 106.7FM, Budweiser, Miccosukee Resort & Gaming and Walgreens, organized a Latin music concert in Miami named "Una Copa con Romance", attended by some 1500 people and artists such as Charlie Zaa. In October 2011, the firm sponsored basketball coach Isiah Thomas's Mary's Court foundation and the "South Florida All-Star Classic" charity match featuring LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, held at the S. Century Bank Arena on the Modesto Maidique Campus of Florida International University.

German submarine U-312

German submarine "U-312" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 10 April 1942 at the Flender Werke yard at Lübeck as 'werk' 312, launched on 27 February 1943 and commissioned on 21 April under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Kurt-Heinz Nicolay.
During her career, the U-boat sailed on eight combat patrols, but sank no ships. She surrendered in May 1945 and was sunk as part of Operation "Deadlight", in November 1945.
She was a member of eight wolfpacks.
Service history.
After training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla, "U-312" was transferred to the 6th flotilla, for front-line service on 1 December 1943. She made the short voyage from Kiel in Germany to Bergen in Norway in the first half of January 1944.
1st, 2nd and 3rd patrols.
She left Bergen on 23 January 1944 and travelled through the north Norwegian Sea and southwest of Bear Island, arriving in Hammerfest on 29 February.
Her second patrol was similar to the first, sailing through the Norwegian, Greenland and Barents Seas. She docked at Narvik on 12 April 1944.
The boat sortied for a third time from Narvik on 29 April 1944. She arrived back at that port on 13 May and moved to Trondheim.
4th and 5th patrols.
Her fourth foray was relatively uneventful, starting and finishing in Narvik.
The submarine's fifth patrol was only notable for clearing the North Cape and passing east of Murmansk.
6th, 7th and 8th patrols.
Patrol number six was slightly different in that it took her as far as the northern Scottish coast, arriving there on 24 December 1944.
The boat was now based at Kilbotn, from whence she sailed on her seventh and eighth patrols.
Surrender and fate.
Following the German capitulation, "U-312" was moved, first from Kilbotn to Narvik, then to Skjomenfjord before arriving at Loch Eriboll in Scotland on 19 May 1945 in preparation for Operation "Deadlight. She was finally transferred to Lisahally and sunk on 29 November by the guns of .

ABU Radio Song Festival 2012

The ABU Radio Song Festival 2012 was the first edition of the biennial Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) Radio Song Festivals. The festival took place in the KBS Hall, which is located in the South Korean capital of Seoul and coincided with the 49th general assembly of the ABU. The ABU Radio Song Festival attracted twenty-six original entries representing eighteen radio broadcasters from fifteen countries, which competed in a preliminary jury round. The juries selected thirteen entries from twelve radio broadcasters in ten countries to qualify for the final show which was held on 11 October 2012. Fifteen entries were originally selected to participate in the grand final. However, Fiji and Sri Lanka withdrew from the radio competition prior to the final show, and thus only thirteen entries participated in the competition on 11 October 2012.
South Korea won the Grand Prix award with the song "For a Rest" performed by boy band Billy Acoustie. Danielle Blakey representing Australia won the gold award with the song "Fearless", Brunei received the silver award with the song "Yang Terindah (So Beautiful)" performed by Maria Aires, with Sammy Ray Jones also representing Australia receiving the bronze award with his song "Rinet". K-Town Clan representing Malaysia received the special jury award with their song "Party Animal". The next edition will be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
History.
The Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had already run an international song contest for its members inspired by the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985–1987, called the "ABU Popular Song Contest", with 14 countries from the Asia-Pacific region competing. The show had a similar concept to the current festivals with the winners being chosen by a professional jury. South Korea, New Zealand and Australia celebrated victories in that competition. In 1989–1991 the ABU co-produced the "ABU Golden Kite World Song Festival" in Malaysia with participation of Asia-Pacific countries, as well as Yugoslavia and Finland.
In 2008, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) proposed a partnership with the ABU on the establishment of an "Asiavision Song Contest"; however these talks didn't produce any results, and in September 2008 it was announced that the Eurovision Song Contest format for Asian production had been sold to a private company from Singapore, Asiavision Pte. Ltd. The original name intended for that event was "Asiavision Song Contest", but it was later changed to "Our Sound - The Asia-Pacific Song Contest" following a request from the ABU, who uses the Asiavision name for their news exchange service. Initially, the contest (which was supposed to be a two program live broadcast TV show with public voting) was set to premiere in 2009, but it was later rescheduled for March 2010 in Macao and then for November 2010 in Mumbai, at the end being postponed indefinitely "due to the ongoing issues between the organizers and EBU".
Shortly before launching the ABU Song Festival, the ABU had been considering the possibility of organizing the "ABU ASEAN TV Song Festival" in Thailand. Historically, ASEAN song contests had been organized in periods between 1981 and 1997, however since 2011 the ASEAN Festival had been organized between local Radio stations such as "Bintang Radio ASEAN".
In November 2011, the ABU announced that they would organize their own TV and Radio Song Festivals to take place in Seoul, the South Korean capital, to coincide with the 49th General Assembly in October 2012. The name "Asiavision Song Contest" was initially mentioned as a possibility, but they were later officially titled "ABU Radio Song Festival" and "ABU TV Song Festival". According to the ABU, the deadline for participation applications for the ABU TV Song Festival was 18 May 2012.
Location.
Seoul, officially the Seoul Special City, is the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea. A megacity with a population of over 10 million, it is the largest city proper in the OECD developed world. The Seoul National Capital Area is the world's second largest metropolitan area with over 25 million inhabitants, which includes the surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province. Almost a quarter of South Koreans live in Seoul, half of South Koreans live in the metropolitan area, along with over 275,000 international residents. 
Located on the Han River, Seoul has been a major settlement for over 2,000 years, with its foundation dating back to 18 B.C. when Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, established its capital in what is now south-east Seoul. It continued as the capital of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty and the Korean Empire. The Seoul National Capital Area is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeokgung, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.
National host broadcaster.
Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) was the host broadcaster for the first edition of the inaugural Radio Song Festivals, which was staged in the KBS Hall. The host broadcaster had offered to cover costs for staging the show as well as the accommodation for the participants of ABU TV Song Festival.
Format.
Unlike the format used in the Eurovision Song Contest there were two versions of the ABU Song Contest. The ABU Radio Song Contest and the ABU TV Song Festival which took place between 11–17 October 2012 during the 49th ABU General Assembly. The theme for the festivals was: 'Beyond the Wave'. This had been inspired by the digital evolution changes in the global media. 
At the preliminary round of the Radio Festival, twenty-six participants from fifteen countries across Asia, Australia and the Pacific performed their entries in front of a jury panel. Thirteen entries representing ten countries qualified for the final show which took place at the KBS Hall on 11 October 2012. An international selection committee voted for their favourites and the top five performers were awarded prizes by a panel of judges. 
The international jury members were producer and songwriter Il Sang Yun, singer/songwriter Gwang Jin Kim, Suk Lee on behalf of KBS Radio 2, Singaporean songwriter Billy Koh, and Vijay Sadhu from the ABU.
Participating countries.
Twenty-six entries participated in a pre-qualification round, fifteen were selected to proceed to the final of the ABU Radio Song Festival (as shown in the following table). However, Sevanaia Yacalevu the Fijian participant withdrew from the competition on 14 September 2012. Yacalevu would have performed last in the running order with the song "Time for a change". Surendra Perera the Sri Lankan participant also announced a withdrawal, although the reason for this is unknown. So the number of finalists was reduced to thirteen.
An international jury awards prizes to their top five favourites after all participating finalists had performed their entries at the ABU Radio Song Festival. The Grand Prix award was issued to the winner, the Gold Award to second place, the Silver Award to third, the Bronze Award to fourth, and a Special Jury award to fifth place.
National jury members.
The members of the international jury who awarded prizes to their top five favourites are as follows:
International broadcasts.
Each participating country was invited to broadcast both events across their respective networks and provide commentary in the native languages to add insight and description to the shows. The festival was not broadcast live, although each broadcaster had stated that they would broadcast the festival between October - November 2012 with an estimated audience of 2 billion people, twenty times the audience that is reached by the Eurovision Song Contest which reaches an audience of approximately 100 million people.

She is a member of the anti-Putinist punk rock group Pussy Riot, and has a history of political activism with the controversial street-art group Voina. On August 17, 2012, she was convicted of "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred" after a performance in Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. On December 23, 2013, she was released early with another Pussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina under a newly passed amnesty bill dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Russian constitution.
Tolokonnikova was recognized as a political prisoner by the Russian human rights group "Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners". Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to "the severity of the response of the Russian authorities".
Early and personal life.
Tolokonnikova was born on November 7, 1989 in Norilsk - the heavily polluted extreme-weather industrial city in the Russian Arctic. In her late school years, she was active in amateur modern literature and art projects, organized by the "Novoye Literaturnoye Obozreniye".
In 2007, Tolokonnikova enrolled in the philosophy department of the Moscow State University (her current student status is unclear). She since married Pyotr Verzilov and gave birth to daughter Gera in 2008. She has Canadian permanent resident status and her husband is a dual citizen of Canada and Russia.
Performances and protests.
Tolokonnikova and Verzilov joined the Voina art collective in 2007 and participated in several of their provocative art performances. In February 2008, they were involved in the "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!" performance in which couples were filmed engaging in sexual acts in the Timiryazev State Biology Museum in Moscow. The performance was apparently intended as a kind of satire of then President Dmitry Medvedev's call for increased reproduction. She was in the late stages of pregnancy at the time. Tolokonnikova was among the Voina members who disrupted a trial for the director of the Andrei Sakharov Center in 2009.
She also took part in a series of actions , (, roughly translated as "Kiss a pig") from January through March 2011. This project comprised female members' forcibly kissing policewomen in Moscow metro stations and on the streets.
Arrest and indictment.
Following the "Punk Prayer" incident in February 21, 2012, a criminal case was opened on February 26 against the band members who had participated. On 3 March, Tolokonnikova and two other alleged members of Pussy Riot were arrested by the Russian authorities and accused of hooliganism. All women at first denied being members of the group and started a hunger strike in protest against being held in jail away from their young children. They were held without bail and were formally charged on June 4, with the indictment running to 2,800 pages.
There was speculation that Canadian authorities might attempt to intervene because Tolokonnikova is a Canadian permanent resident; however this did not occur.
Court case and imprisonment.
Tolokonnikova was serving the remainder of her two-year sentence in the "IK-14" women's penal colony near the settlement of Partsa (), Republic of Mordovia. On September 23, 2013 she went on hunger strike over prison conditions and alleged threats against her life made by prison staff. Her letter on the conditions of the women in the penal colony asserts that the women have no rights. The prisoners must work 16–17 hours and sleep 3–4 hours a day; they have a day-off every 8th week. If they complain, they are punished. If they complain over the treatment of other prisoners, they are punished even harder. Collective punishment is frequent but the prisoners may also be beaten up with particular focus on hitting the kidneys. Another punishment consists of keeping a prisoner outdoor in the cold without sufficient clothing. Most of what she reports is confirmed from other sources.
While imprisoned, she exchanged letters with filmmaker, philosopher, and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek discussing democracy and her activism. Their correspondence has been compiled into a book "" set to be published by Verso Books on September 30, 2014. 
In late September 2013, Tolokonnikova was hospitalised after going without food for a week. She was treated in the prison's medical ward, and authorities didn't release more specific details.
On October 21, 2013, she was transferred to another prison; her whereabouts remained unknown for several weeks. On November 5, 2013, it was reported that Tolokonnikova had been transferred to IK-50, a prison located near Nizhny Ingash, approximately 300 kilometres from Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. On November 15, she was again able to communicate with her husband through a video call from the prison hospital.
Release.
On the afternoon of December 23, 2013 Tolokonnikova was released from a prison hospital in Krasnoyarsk, where she was being treated for an unspecified illness. According to Yelena Pimonenko, senior prosecutor assistant of the Krasnoyarsk Krai, Tolokonnikova was released because the article "hooliganism" of the Russian Criminal Code falls under the newly introduced amnesty bill. Putin’s amnesty is seen by the freed prisoners and numerous critics as a propaganda stunt as Russia prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in February. Tolokonnikova said "... releasing people just a few months before their term expires is a cosmetic measure... That includes the case of Khodorkovsky, who didn't have much time left on his prison term. This is ridiculous. While Putin refuses to release those people who really needed it. It is a disgusting and cynical act" and urged countries to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics. She and Alyokhina said they would form a human rights movement for prison reforms. On March 6, 2014, she was assaulted and injured at a fast food outlet by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.
Sochi detention.
In February 2014, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, were detained in Sochi by the Adler Police in connection with an alleged hotel theft. They were released without charge. On February 19, footage surfaced showing Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina being attacked with horsewhips, by Cossacks, who were helping patrol Sochi during the Winter Olympics.

Yekaterina Samutsevich

Yekaterina Stanislavovna Samutsevich (; born August 9, 1982) is a Russian political activist. She is a member of the anti-Putinist punk rock group Pussy Riot. On August 17, 2012, she was convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred for a performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years imprisonment. She has been recognized as a political prisoner by the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners. Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to “the severity of the response of the Russian authorities.”
She was released on a suspended sentence by a Moscow appeals judge on October 10, 2012 following an argument from her lawyer that she had been stopped by cathedral guards before she could get her guitar out of its case.
She is a computer programmer and a graduate of the Rodchenko School of Photography and Multimedia in Moscow. For two years she worked for a defense contractor on a secret project, to develop software for the nuclear attack submarine K-152 Nerpa. Thereafter she worked as a freelance programmer. She is interested in LGBT issues. Court sessions were attended by her father, Stanislav Samutsevich.
Samutsevich has been a member of the Voina collective since 2007. In 2010, Samutsevich was among the Voina activists who attempted to release live cockroaches into the Tagansky Courthouse; the extent to which they succeeded in this action is disputed. She was later prosecuted in the same building for their involvement in Pussy Riot’s “punk prayer”. She also took part in a series of actions, "Operation Kiss Garbage", from January through March 2011. This project comprised female members kissing policewomen in Moscow Metro stations and on the streets. It was primarily an anti-government protest, but also controversial because the non-consensual “ambush kissing” could be considered sexual battery.

Maria Alyokhina

Maria Vladimirovna Alyokhina (; born June 6, 1988 in Moscow) is a Russian political activist. She is a member of the anti-Putinist punk rock group Pussy Riot. On August 17, 2012, she was convicted of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” for a performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. She has been recognized as a political prisoner by the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners. Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to "the severity of the response of the Russian authorities."
At the time of her arrest, Alyokhina was a fourth-year student at the Institute of Journalism and Creative Writing in Moscow, where she participated in the literature courses of Dmitry Vedenyapin and Alexey Kubrik. She is a published poet. She has been involved in environmental activism with Greenpeace Russia, opposing development projects in the Khimki Forest, and was a volunteer at the Children's Psychiatric Hospital in Moscow. Her son Filip was born in 2008. She is a vegan and reportedly collapsed from hunger during the trial, as no vegan meals were provided in detention. 
She played an active role in the Pussy Riot trial, cross-examining witnesses, and aggressively questioning the charges and proceedings. She said in her closing statement:
For me, this trial only has the status of a "so-called" trial. And I am not afraid of you. I am not afraid of lies and fiction, of the thinly disguised fraud in the sentence of this so-called court. Because you can only take away my so-called freedom. And that is the exact kind that exists now in Russia. But nobody can take away my inner freedom.
Alyokhina was released from prison on December 23, 2013 under an amnesty bill passed by the Russian Duma, allowing the release of several inmates. Following her release, Alyokhina and fellow Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova announced their intention to campaign for prisoner's rights in Russia.On 6 March 2014, she was assaulted and injured at a fast food outlet by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.

Rubyworks Records

Rubyworks Records is an independent record label and music management company based in Dublin, Ireland. Owner, Niall Muckian, started the company in 2001. Muckian was initially working with Damien Rice, helping him with the formation of his solo career when he saw Rodrigo y Gabriela supporting him at Vicar Street in Dublin. He decided he wanted to work with them. Rubyworks went on to release "re-Foc" in September 2002 and has been managing Rodrigo y Gabriela since.
Rubyworks owns two subsidiary labels, Gotta Run Records and Model Citizen Records.
In May 2012 Rubyworks merged with UK independent record label Ark Recordings.
History.
Formation.
Rubyworks was formed by Niall Muckian in Dublin in 2001. Muckian saw Rodrigo y Gabriela supporting Damien Rice at Vicar Street in Dublin and wanted to work with them. Rubyworks released "re-Foc" in September 2002, and continues to manage Rodrigo y Gabrela to this day.
2004 to 2006.
Rubyworks took its next step by releasing a new Hothouse Flowers ("Into Your Heart") album in early 2004. Developing an international presence, the label helped established Irish acts like Aslan and Jerry Fish & The Mudbug Club release their music outside of Ireland. The next major break through came later in 2004, when the second Rodrigo y Gabriela album, "", became the first wholly instrumental album to debut in the Irish album chart Top 10. Rodrigo y Gabriela's and Rubyworks' local and international profile started to increase from this juncture.
In 2005, Roger Quail joined Rubyworks from the UK, having previously had long spells at 3mv (Oasis, Suede, Ministry of Sound) and Sony's SINE independent label development wing with a view to developing Rubyworks' international profile. The label enjoyed further critical success with Dublin rock group The Devlins. In early 2006 the label enjoyed its greatest success to date with the third Rodrigo y Gabriela album, which charted at # 1 in the Irish album charts in February 2006. The label also released new albums from Leya and Koufax in the same year
2007 to 2008.
2007/2008 saw Rubyworks busier than ever. With a new album from Sinéad O'Connor out in June, a live CD/DVD package from the reformed Moving Hearts; and the debut album from County Down singer/songwriter Foy Vance as well as an album from Mary Coughlan. Due to international licensing deals in North America, Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa, global sales of the Rodrigo y Gabriela rose to over 500,000.
2009 to present.
In May 2012 Rubyworks merged with UK independent record label Ark Recordings. In August 2012 Rubyworks celebrated its first decade in existence with three Dublin concerts featuring performances from bands like Rodrigo y Gabriela and Fight Like Apes.

Ayad Fayid al-Rawi

Ayad Futayyih Khalifa al-Rawi (Arabic: إياد فايد خليفة الراوي) was a General of the Iraqi Republican Guard, and later served as the head of the Al Quds Army. He started his service in the Army as an officer in an armoured unit, later fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, receiving numerous medals and suffering a severe head wound whilst leading an Iraqi counterattack against an Iranian offensive. In total Rawi was awarded 27 medals during the Iran-Iraq war. He was perceived to be a staunch Saddam loyalist.
Rawi was born in Rawa in 1942.
Iran-Iraq War.
He served as commander of the Republican Guard forces at the second battle of Al Faw, which comprised some 60% of the forces deployed.
During his interview with the Iraqi Perspectives Project, al-Rawi was named by General Hamdani as one of the few first-rate commanders. Hamdani lists one of the few reasons why Hussein Kamel's attempts to improve the quality of the Republican Guard during the Iran-Iraq War was successful was because he listened to al-Rawi.
Later career.
Rawi went on to serve as Governor of both Baghdad and Ta'mim Governorates.
He later became the Chief of Staff of the Al Quds Volunteer Army; a paramilitary force created in early 2001 in response to the beginning of the Second Intifada. The forces objective was seemingly to defeat Israel and liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and the force was declared to be composed of some 21 divisions and 7 million Iraqi's, although in actuality the force was largely a propaganda stunt to show support for the Palestinians, and the force was small and ineffective.
Rawi was arrested on June 4, 2003, following the US led Invasion of Iraq. He was no. 30 of Central Commands "Top 55" list, appearing as the seven of clubs in the Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Despite it's claimed size, the Al Quds Army ended up playing virtually no role in the war
Prior to the invasion Rawi was on a list of sanctioned individuals.

He was also featured on Lil Wayne's "I Am Not a Human Being II" on the song "Beat The Shit". His debut album "Living Legend" is scheduled to be released in 2014.
Personal life.
Gunplay has a son with his ex-wife whom he divorced in 2008.
Legal issues.
TMZ had reported that on Wednesday, October 10, 2012, Richard Morales Jr. had turned himself in to Miami authorities, after a warrant had been issued for his arrest on charges of armed robbery. Morales also faced a second charge of aggravated assault with a firearm. According to the rapper's attorney, Gunplay could have faced life in prison if convicted on both counts. On October 13 a video leaked of Gunplay committing the crime. After seen talking on the tape, the man purported to be Gunplay brandishes a pistol, and eventually takes some jewelry and money from the accountant. A third, unidentified man in the meeting, who appeared to have come with the assailant, attempts to mediate the situation after which the man appearing to be Gunplay leaves. On October 22, 2012, he was given a $150,000 dollar bond and placed on house arrest in connection to the robbery which took place at a Miami tax business. He was released from house arrest during January 2013.
On the morning of February 25, 2013, Gunplay's trial began on the charges of armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault, stemming from when he allegedly pulled a gun on his accountant during April 2012. Later that day, it was announced that the case was dismissed because the victim, Turron Woodside, refused to further cooperate with authorities. Woodside refused to authenticate the footage of the incident and was "out of town" according to his family. Subsequently, the prosecution in the armed robbery case was forced to drop the charges against Gunplay.
Controversy.
Gunplay has a Swastika tattoo. In an interview, he said, "Swastika was originally a sign of peace, happiness, and love. The Nazis turned it into the symbol of death. That’s the same way I feel society does to people. We start off as innocent babies and it turns us into monsters. If the shoe fits, wear it."
At the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, Gunplay was involved in an fist fight with members of 50 Cent's G-Unit affiliates backstage. 50 Cent was later seen in a video, bowling wearing Gunplay's MMG (Maybach Music Group) chain. The chain was also shown in rapper 50 Cent's single's video clip 'Major Distribution' (ft. Snoop Dogg & Young Jeezy). The chain was worn by Kidd Kidd's son in the video.

The ScareHouse

The ScareHouse is a haunted attraction located at 118 Locust Street in Etna, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb. It is located in a historic building that has been home to the Etna First National Bank, the Spang and Chalfont Company, and the Etna Elks Order (a fraternal organization) No. 932. The ScareHouse is open on select dates each year September through November. In 2013 CBS News called ScareHouse "One of America's Scariest Haunted Houses". ScareHouse received additional recognition from Guillermo del Toro who stated “It really is beautiful. With the sound design and the atmospherics, it is beautiful. I could live here!” and Michael Dougherty who stated: “I left so happy and inspired. You guys nailed it!” In 2010 the ScareHouse was rated as one of "The 10 Wickedest Haunted Houses In America" by Forbes Magazine, and in 2012 was rated #5 in the US in Top Haunt Magazine's Top 13 Haunts. The ScareHouse offers three heavily themed attractions or “haunts” which are significantly revised on a yearly basis.
ScareHouse history.
The first production of The ScareHouse was presented in 1999. It is owned by Scott, Barb, and Wayne Simmons. Creative Director Scott Simmons has been in the haunt industry for more than twenty years, having started with local non-profit haunts and various fundraisers. In 1985 he volunteered at a YMCA haunted house while in high school. During the 1980s and 1990s Scott worked within a few non-profit events and his father Wayne created and constructed the more elaborate sets and projects. Scott met his wife Barb while working on a haunted house for the Pittsburgh firefighters and Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD in 1990.
History of the Building.
The ScareHouse is located at 118 Locust Street in Etna, Pennsylvania. The ScareHouse has integrated the historical foundations and fabrics of this building into the haunt design through utilizing existing structures (walls and the original stage) in the haunt layout. The building once provided an employee recreational facility for the Spang and Chalfont Company before being bought by the Etna Elks No. 932. Etna Lodge No. 932 spent over 75 years at 118 Locust Street. There are still many reminders of the Elks Lodge No. 932 throughout the building, such as antique chairs and tables.
Haunts.
Retired Haunts.
Hall of Nightmares 2007–2009.
The Hall of Nightmares was an assortment of highly detailed scenes and characters that was primarily influenced by EC comics such as Tales From The Crypt, Italian horror movies such as Suspiria, the Haunted mansion at Disney and traditional haunted house situations and scenarios. The designers utilized vibrant colors and stylized scenic design to create a series of thinly connected and surreal scenes involving creatures, clowns, and cloaked figures.
Screamatorium 2007–2008.
Screamatorium opened in 2007 and was much darker, realistic, and intense than Hall of Nightmares. This attraction was set inside an abandoned research facility dating back to the early 1900s, which was filled with mutated creatures and their helpless victims. The design team took heavy influence from films such as "Silent Hill" to create a series of medically themed labs, offices, and holding cells lit by flickering incandescent bulbs.
Delirium 3-D 2008–2011.
Delirium 3-D first opened in 2008. Guests were given 3-D glasses at the entrance of the haunt to experience the many 3-D effects of the sets. Delirium 3-D took guests into the deranged and demented world of the main character "Delirium", which was filled with fluorescent colors, loud music, puppets, and twisted creatures. The general theme was inspired by a mix of psyho/punk/pop/rave culture. The characters in this haunt were known for their random, confusing, though entertaining sayings and antics.
In 2012 the ScareHouse hosted musical artist Delirium Dog, who heavily inspired and took inspiration from the Delirium haunt. Delirium Dog preformed live in the haunt during the 2011 season.
Rampage! 2009–2010.
Rampage! was heavily influenced by Steampunk a sub-genre of fantasy and science-fiction that attracted a growing fan base of alternative artists. The term denotes works set in an alternative Victorian era of culture and technology where steam power is still the predominant form of energy. The ScareHouse designers studied reference photos and technical drawings to find inspiration for new costumes, sets, and other production elements.
Rampage! took customers into a world divided by war; on the one side were the 'rebels' who were fighting against the evil 'Die-Rector' and 'Daphnie'. These two characters were featured heavily in ScareHouse ads and promotions. The Die-Rector gained further recognition in 2010 when he was invited to participate in 'Dancing with the Celebrities of Pittsburgh .'
Current Haunts (2012).
The Forsaken 2009–Present.
The Forsaken opened in 2009 to replace 'Hall of NightMares.' The Forsaken is set in a mythical town of citizens that have lost their souls and are condemned to stalk and haunt the town. Sets include a broken down and haunted Carnival, complete with demented clowns, roustabouts, and fairway barkers. Other notable sets include a highly detailed and realistic 'game' room and 'butcher' shop complete with stuffed prey and animal carcasses.
The Forsaken introduced the character of 'Creepo,' a murderous clown that became known for taunting and interacting with customers. This character proved so popular that the ScareHouse developed a new haunt, Creepo's Christmas in 3-D, around him as a clown turned Santa Claus.
Pittsburgh Zombies 2011–Present.
Pittsburgh Zombies opened as the third haunt within The ScareHouse in 2011. The Pittsburgh Zombies attraction features elaborate and Hollywood-quality recreations of iconic Pittsburgh landmarks, while actors portray legions of the walking dead. An experienced team of set designers and scenic artists worked to create a real-life version of the zombie apocalypse that has been so memorably and frighteningly portrayed by the series of Night of the Living Dead films shot in and around the Pittsburgh area over the last forty years. Notable Pittsburgh Zombies sets include a crashed incline cable car, a recreation of Primanti's Brothers restaurant, and a lab where the outbreak started named 'UPEC'.
Creepo's Christmas in 3D 2012.
Creepo's Christmas debuts in 2012 as the newest 3-D haunt. This haunt is built around the character of Creepo, the demented clown from The Forsaken. This experience places guests in a 'creepy' and twisted Christmas town where Creepo, wearing a Santa cap, seethes over early Christmas decorations. According to Scott Simmons, owner and creative director of The ScareHouse, part of the inspiration for this genre came from the ever earlier appearance of Christmas wares in retail stores. Simmons states: “Once the retail stores started displaying Christmas decorations in October, Creepo the Clown decided it was time to take a stand for Halloween.” 
The Basement 2013-Present.
The Basement is not a traditional linear walk through haunted attraction, rather it is an interactive and "immersive" experience that involves the actors speaking to and touching customers. The event is restricted to only one or two guests entering at a time. It is a more intense and thrilling experience with adult content and explicit language. The Basement has held two off season events, one during Christmas and one scheduled to run during Valentine's Day on February 15. The Basement is marketed and geared towards those who seek a more extreme experience. Everyone must be 18 years old and sign a waiver before entry.
Community Involvement.
While The ScareHouse is a for-profit, commercial venture it is still heavily involved in the Pittsburgh community. The ScareHouse contributes to multiple charitable organizations, and frequently collaborates with socially active bloggers, businesses, and causes. The Crazy Scary event, held in both 2010 and 2011, contributed more than $12,000 local kids in need. The Crazy Scary fundraiser benefits two local fundraising drives, Make Room for Kids and Christmas Crazy for Kids.
Make Room for Kids is a social media-driven fundraising effort originated by local blogger Virginia Montanez from That's Church (also known as "PittGirl" ) designed to bring gaming and laptops to sick children at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, in association with The Mario Lemieux Foundation.
Christmas Crazy for Kids was created by local blogger Michelle Hammons of the blog Burgh Baby. Donated funds are used to purchase and deliver toys to Toys for Tots and HOPE center
The ScareHouse has also partnered with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Etna Economic Development Corporation, Haitian Families First, and the Delta Foundation.
In 2013 ScareHouse was a sponsor of the Great American Water Balloon Fight which is dedicated to fighting global poverty.
ScareHouse works with Margee Kerr in developing video content on why and how people enjoy scary and thrilling material. Their work was featured on Geek and Sundry and Nerdy But Flirty . Margee Kerr is currently writing a book with PublicAffairs on how society engages with thrilling situations.
ScareHouse PodCast.
The ScareHouse podcast started broadcasting on iTunes in May 2011. While many of the podcasts are related to haunted houses and the haunted industry, they also cover topics like social media and marketing, dating in Pittsburgh, Anthrocon, sound and design, and paranormal activity. The podcasts are heavily focused on personal narrative and investigating the intersections of the haunted industry and society at large.
ScareHouse and The Ghost Hunters.
The ScareHouse has brought the members of the Ghost Hunters team Amy Bruni, Steve Gonsalves, Kris Williams, Dave Tango, and Adam Berry to Pittsburgh five times, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, 2011. The ScareHouse Podcast from March 27, 2012 features an in-depth interview with Ghost Hunter Ami Bruni.

The group released their debut single, the eponymous "Bel Amour" in 2001, which sampled "The Mystery With Me" by Jo Bisso. The Tommy Boy single release contained fives mixes of the song, including an instrumental, ranging in length from five to eight minutes. Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier was complimentary of the original radio edit of the song, writing that "though brief, this edit includes all of the song's vocals, making this dancefloor anthem into a succinct dance-pop single." 
The track, which mixes a male vocal with a filtered disco backing, generated buzz at the 2000 Winter Music Conference in Miami Beach, Florida. 
The single peaked at number 23 in the United Kingdom, and also charted in France and Switzerland in 2001. It entered the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Songs chart the following year.
A follow up single, "Promise Me" was released in 2003.

USCGC Point Judith (WPB-82345)

USCGC "Point Judith" (WPB-82345) was an Point class cutter constructed at the J.M. Martinac Shipbuilding Corp. yards at Tacoma, Washington in 1966 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.
Construction and design details.
"Point Judith" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Judith" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.
History.
After commissioning, "Point Judith" was stationed at San Pedro, California, from 1966 to 1972 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 8 March 1970 she fought fire and rescued the operator of the FV "Mikki Sue" off Long Beach, California. On 13 July she towed the disabled to San Pedro. 
In 1973 "Point Judith" was transferred to Santa Barbara, California where she was used for search and rescue as well as some aids to navigation work. On 15 June 1983, she helped the United States Customs Service seize the Greenpeace MV "Pacific Peacemaker", which was attempting to disrupt a test of the MX Missile off Vandenberg Air Force Base. On 22 November 1984 she seized the yacht "Mir" off Santa Rosa Island with of marijuana on board. On 21 September 1987 "Point Judith" assisted following a collision between MVs "Pacharoness" and "Atlantic Wing" southwest of Point Conception.
"Point Judith" was decommissioned 15 January 1992 and transferred to Venezuela. She currently serves as "Alcatraz" (PG-32).

2012 Metro Manila flooding

The 2012 Metro Manila Flooding, informally known as a "habagat" (monsoon), was an eight-day period of torrential rain and thunderstorms in the Philippines from August 1 to August 8, 2012. Its effects centered on Metro Manila, the surrounding provinces of the CALABARZON Region (Quezon, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal) and the provinces of Region 3 (Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan). Not a typhoon in its own right, the storm was a strong movement of the southwest monsoon () caused by the pull of Typhoon Saola (Gener) from August 1–3, strengthened by Typhoon Haikui. It caused typhoon-like damage: the most damage caused by rain since September 2009, when Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck Metro Manila. The heavy rain caused the Marikina River to overflow, destroying areas also affected by Ketsana, triggering a landslide in the Commonwealth area and collapsing the northbound Marcos Highway.
Its damage was nearly as severe as Ketsana's, although the storm did not reach typhoon intensity when the rain reached its peak on August 7. Due to its monsoon-like damage, the period was called "Ang Hagupit ng Habagat" ("monsoon wrath") and "Bagsik ng Habagat" ("fierce monsoon"). The floods and rain left 95 people dead, 8,428 homes destroyed and 6,706 damaged. Nationwide losses totaled at least ₱604.63 million (US$14.31 million).
Typhoon Gener.
On July 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical wind shear in the monsoon trough about southeast of Manila. Although the shear temporarily relaxed, it increased the following day and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression (naming it "Gener"); the JTWC upgraded "Saola" to a tropical storm, and early on July 29 the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. On July 30 the JTWC upgraded Gener to a Category 1 typhoon (since it began developing an eye-like feature), but downgraded it to a tropical storm later that day. The following day, the JTWC again upgraded Saola to a Category 1 typhoon. Later that day the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon, and the JTWC upgraded it to a category 2 typhoon early on August 1.
Typhoon Gener did not make landfall in the Philippines, and occupied a small portion of the northern Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). It pulled southwest-monsoon winds from the South China Sea and damaged the City of Manila, causing a storm surge and striking the fish ports of Navotas City and Malabon City. It broke a large part of the sea wall on Roxas Boulevard, and caused tons of refuse be washed onto the Baywalk. Portions of Metro Manila damaged by Typhoon Pedring in 2011 were under repair when the storm hit.
Aftermath.
Shortly after the typhoon, cleanup of the Manila Bay Coast was ordered by the Department of Public Works and Highways DPWH and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority MMDA. Initial reports indicated about a dozen confirmed casualties, but early on August 3 Philippine authorities revised the death toll to 37 with at least 519,000 people affected. More than 17,500 were in evacuation centers. As of August 6, 51 fatalities were confirmed in the Philippines with six reported missing. Damage from the storm amounted to about ₱404 million (US$9.6 million), half of which was agricultural losses. When Gener left the PAR, its wind would be triggered by Typhoon Haikui to cause heavy rainfall on August 6.
August 3–4.
With strong winds, the La Mesa Dam in Novaliches was near overflowing.
August 6.
Typhoon Haikui.
Hundreds of kilometers from the Philippines, the southerly flow from Typhoon Haikui enhanced the southwest monsoon across much of Luzon. As a result, widespread heavy rains impacted regions recovering from deadly floods triggered by Typhoon Saola less than a week earlier. During a 72-hour period (August 6–8), of rain fell in parts of Metro Manila (leading local media to compare the event to Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, which killed 464 people in the city).
Marikina and Tullahan Rivers.
The Marikina River, which overflowed during Typhoon Ondoy, again reached the deadly 19-meter level by 7:00 pm. Because of the rain, two of the La Mesa Dam's gates to the Tullahan River were opened; the water flowed to Barangay Greater Lagro, flooding Lagro High School and the Regalado Highway (nearly ). After the gates were opened, the Tullahan flooded North and West Fairview and the Santa Lucia District. It submerged the Atherton Bridge in Fairview, and many houses along the banks were swept away. A number of schools in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and CALABARZON suspended classes, and as a precautionary measure officials cut power to some areas of National Capital Region (NCR). At least 250,000 people left their homes when flooding covered more than a third of the city. The head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) compared the deluge to the Kevin Costner film "Waterworld".
Landslide in Barangay Commonwealth.
At 8:00 am, in the hills of the Commonwealth District in Quezon City, a rare landslide occurred which buried two houses (owned by the Baylon and Castulo families, and housing 12 people). The inhabitants were rushed to East Avenue Medical Center. Nine were dead on arrival: Jayson Baylon (age 16), Jayvee Baylon (20), Jissele Baylon (7), Cecilia Baylon (50), Jonathan Castulo (3), Junica Castulo (three weeks), Jessica and Jethro Baylon, and Joshua Castulo.
August 7.
The most-severe flooding occurred on August 7 along the Marikina River, which swelled to near-record levels. During the afternoon the river reached a height of , well beyond the flood level of and about above its banks but below the record level set during Typhoon Ketsana. It again flooded Provident Village, among the villages most damaged by Ketsana. Flooding also occurred on Espana Boulevard and at the University of Santo Tomas, which lie along the river.
Munoz, Balintawak and Baesa.
The northern district of Quezon City was heavily flooded by the Tullahan River. Most of the water flowed along the Quirino Highway to the North Luzon Expressway and A. Bonifacio Street, and the Freeway was closed to traffic that afternoon. Flooding also occurred, from a creek in Munoz, causing flooding on the EDSA and Roosevelt Avenue.
Roxas District, Tatalon and Damayan Lagi.
These districts, along Gregorio Araneta Avenue, had been damaged by Typhoon Ketsana. The creek under the median rose, and by noon flooding nearly reached two-storey buildings and businesses along the Avenue and the nearby roads (particularly Gumamela Street and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Boulevard).
Manggahan Floodway and Laguna De Bay.
Overflow from the Marikina River swelled the Manggahan Floodway, flooding Pasig and Taguig Cities and overflowing Laguna de Bay. The overflowing of the bay flooded the cities of San Pedro and Calamba in Laguna; both were declared in a state of emergency the following day.
City of Manila.
The rain triggered several monsoon surges, which again flooded Roxas Boulevard and submerged the Quezon Boulevard Claro M. Recto Underpass in Quiapo and the Lagusnilad-Taft Avenue Underpass on Padre Burgos Street. Waist-high water flooded Manila City Hall, destroying files and documents.
Government response.
In response to the flooding, the NDRRMC allocated about ₱13 million (US$311,000) in relief funds and deployed 202 people to assist in search-and-rescue operations; however, the operations were hampered by strong currents in flooded streets. Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered officials to maximize efforts to rescue and aid affected residents.
San Juan and Santa Mesa.
The San Juan River flooded Santa Mesa and San Juan, including the UERM Hospital; several floors were submerged, and staff and patients experienced shortages of food and medicine. Patients were moved to the upper floors for their safety.
August 8.
On August 8, more than a million families were affected. The NCR and nine nearby provinces were under a state of calamity, with some areas flooded up to the second storey; seventy to ninety percent of Metro Manila was affected by flooding. Communications were heavily affected; distress calls and text messages from thousands of Metro Manila residents and their families flooded television and radio stations, since most power and water were interrupted. Although a red warning was downgraded to yellow during the morning, it was upgraded to red until midnight August 9 that afternoon after another round of heavy rain; some schools extended their suspension of classes. Airports also had severe flooding, cancelling flights or diverting them to Clark International in Pampanga and other airports.
Some areas of Metro Manila were submerged up to ; city officials evacuated over 23,000 residents from flood-prone areas, moving them to shelters. According to a British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent, many residents were reluctant to leave their belongings behind and some returned through floodwaters to retrieve their possessions. Officials feared that flooding could worsen as the La Mesa Dam continued to overflow.
Aftermath.
Throughout the Philippines a total of 89 people were confirmed dead, with seven listed as missing. A total of 8,428 homes were destroyed, and another 6,706 damaged. Losses throughout the country totaled at least ₱604.63 million (US$14.31 million).

Indie Game Challenge

The Indie Game Challenge is an award competition run in conjunction between the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS), GameStop and The Guildhall at Southern Methodist University (SMU) to support independent video game development. Started in 2009, the competition highlights ten to twelve independent games, with winning games receiving monetary rewards in addition to the award. The Indie Game Challenge ceremonies are held during the annual D.I.C.E. Summit, during which the finalists are able to demonstrate their games to the press.
Concept.
The Indie Game Challenge awards were created by AIAS, Gamestop, and the Guildhall to promote innovation in gaming from independent development. Mike Hogan, senior vice-president of marketing for Gamestop, cited the need for "new, cutting edge game developers who continue to stretch the boundaries and imaginations of gamers" in the industry, and hoped that the awards would "stimulate a new generation of game developers". The competition was designed to offer both monetary and scholarship prizes, valued up to $300,000.
The Challenge accepts games in playable, near-complete versions (including beta software), and for games that have been released, limits such entries to those that have earned less than $100,000 prior to the competition. The Challenge allows entries for games that have already been submitted to other game contests. Once the judges have selected the finalists, a public voter for "Gamer's Choice" is started among the finalists for a $10,000 prize. The finalists are invited to the D.I.C.E. Summit, giving them exposure to major video game publishers and journalists, a lucrative opportunity for independent developers. After the major awards have been announced, the judges then select finalists to give graduate scholarships to SMU.
The first year for the Challenge drew more than 250 entries to select from.

Pellegrina

The pellegrina is an item of clerical dress worn by some Catholic ecclesiastics.
Description.
Similar to the mozzetta but open in front, the pellegrina is a short shoulder cape reaching to the elbow. It is made of black or white material trimmed and lined with amaranth red (for bishops) or scarlet red (for cardinals). The pope's pellegrina is entirely white. In some English-speaking countries, priests wear a pellegrina of the same colour as their plain black cassock.
Use.
The general rule of the Roman Catholic Church is that the pellegrina may be worn with the cassock by cardinals and bishops.
In 1850, the year in which Pope Pius IX restored the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, he was understood to grant to all priests there the privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white cassock with pellegrina. Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the cassock has been a sign of a Catholic priest in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.
In his 1909 book, "Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church", John Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa proposed the use of the English word "simar", instead of the word "cassock", for the garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as distinct from the cassock proper. Others too have made the same distinction between the "simar" (with pellegrina) and the "cassock" (without), but many scholars disagree with Nainfa's distinction. More particularly, the documents of the Holy See make no such distinction, using the term "cassock" or "vestis talaris" whether a pellegrina is attached or is not. Thus the 1969 Instruction states that, for cardinals and bishops, "the elbow-length cape, trimmed in the same manner as this "cassock", may be worn over it". "Cassock", rather than "simar" is the term that is usually applied to the dress of Popes and other Catholic ecclesiastics. The Instruction also gives no support to Nainfa's claim that the cassock with shoulder cape should not be worn in church services, which would be of difficult application, since the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a single garment, with a non-detachable pellegrina.
Origin of the name.
The pellegrina owes its name to its similarity to a more ample shoulder cape of cloth or leather that was traditionally worn by pilgrims ("pellegrini" in Italian).

Iosif Berman

Iosif Berman (January 17, 1892 – September 17, 1941) was a Romanian photographer and journalist during the interwar period.
Early life.
Iosif Berman was born in , near Suceava to a Jewish father who had been awarded the Romanian citizenship for participating in the 1877 Romanian War of Independence.
From an early age, Berman became interested in photography and as a child he spent time in the company of the itinerant photographers of Suceava and Cernăuți. Before the age of 18, he moved to Bucharest, where he earned money to buy a camera. His first photos were published in 1913 in the "" depicting the cholera lazaretto from Turtucaia. He continued working at the "Adevărul" and "Dimineaţa" newspapers, both of which were owned by left-wing activist Constantin Mille.
During World War I, he was a regiment photographer and he was able to take photos of the October Revolution in Odessa, but his photographic plates were confiscated, on turns, by the Whites and by the Bolsheviks. In 1918, he contributed to "Realitatea Ilustrată" with a set of photographs of the fleeing German Army. After his regiment was disbanded, he traveled to Novorossiysk, in the Caucasus, where he met Raisa, whom he married and with whom he had a daughter, Luiza.
Photojournalist.
Between 1920 and 1923, he was a correspondent from Istanbul for the Romanian newspaper. After returning to Romania, he was a photographer for the major Romanian newspaper, taking photographs of the Royal Family.
During the mid-1920s, Berman collaborated with sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, who studied the Romanian village and traditions, and with for his reportage articles.
His photographs were published in all the major Romanian newspapers of the time: "Adevărul", "Dimineaţa", "Curentul", "Realitatea ilustrată", "România ilustrată", "Ilustraţiunea română", "Cuvântul liber", "" and also in "The New York Times" and "National Geographic", being a correspondent of the Associated Press and Scandinavian Newspaper Press.
Fascist era.
In 1937, the Octavian Goga government closed down the left-wing newspapers for which he worked and his life's work, the boxes with the photographic plates from the archive of the "Adevărul" and "Dimineaţa" newspapers were confiscated. Nevertheless, he continued to work and to send photographs to "The New York Times".
Following the advice of Romanian historian and later Prime Minister Nicolae Iorga, Berman began using a pseudonym, I. B. Urseanu, (which is a translation of his Jewish name) in order not to attract the attention of the antisemitic Iron Guard.
Nevertheless, in 1940, he was banned from continuing his work due to the Anti-Jewish laws which were enacted by the National Legionary State. Depressed, he soon died, on September 17, 1941, according to his daughter, he died of a renal disease for which he refused to get any treatment.
Legacy.
After WWII, the communist government tried to use the photos for propaganda, but they were hardly propaganda material. According to a researcher at Museum of the Romanian Peasant, he presented a realist view of the village, with its poor, its gypsies, its village idiot.
Nevertheless, the photos were rediscovered after the 1989 Romanian Revolution at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which also published a monography on him. A documentary on his life and work was also made, called "Omul cu o mie de ochi" (The Man with a Thousand Eyes), directed by .

Riemann's minimal surface

In differential geometry, Riemann's minimal surface is a one-parameter family of minimal surfaces described by Bernhard Riemann in a posthumous paper published in 1867. Surfaces in the family are singly periodic minimal surfaces with an infinite number of ends asymptotic to parallel planes, each plane "shelf" connected with catenoid-like bridges to the neighbouring ones. Their intersections with horizontal planes are circles or lines; Riemann proved that they were the only minimal surfaces fibered by circles in parallel planes besides the catenoid, helicoid and plane. They are also the only nontrivial embedded minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space invariant under the group generated by a nontrivial translation. It is possible to attach extra handles to the surfaces, producing higher-genus minimal surface families.

Bobs Worth

Bobs Worth (foaled 21 May 2005) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. He has won ten of his fourteen races, including the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle in 2011, the RSA Chase in 2012 and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2013 at the Cheltenham Festival, making him the first horse for over forty years to win three different races at consecutive Cheltenham Festivals. In 2012, he also won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury. Bobs Worth is trained by Nicky Henderson, owned by the Not Afraid Partnership and has been ridden in all but one of his starts by jockey Barry Geraghty.
Background.
Bobs Worth is a bay gelding bred by Mrs L Eadie and foaled on 21 May 2005. His sire was top jump sire Bob Back. Bob Back's progeny include Mildmay Novices' Chase winner Burton Port and Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner Back In Front. Bob Back was a son of 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto. Bobs Worth's dam, Fashionista, is a daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner King's Theatre.
Racing career.
Early career.
Bobs Worth started his racing career in the 2009/10 National Hunt season. He ran in two national hunt flat races at Kempton Park, finishing second in one and winning the other. In November 2010 he raced for the first time over hurdles, beating Sire De Grugy by nine lengths in a two-mile novices hurdle race at Kempton Park. He followed this up, racing away from Kempton for the first time, by winning a two and a half mile hurdle race at Cheltenham. He then stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Classic Novices' Hurdle, also at Cheltenham. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, he won the race by two and a quarter lengths from future Champion Hurdle winner Rock On Ruby, with the two nine lengths clear of third placed Habbie Simpson. At the Cheltenham Festival he started as the 15/8 favourite for the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle. In the early stages of the race he was placed in the middle of the eighteen-runner field by Geraghty. He took the lead between the last two hurdles and won by two and a quarter lengths from Mossley. Court In Motion finished in third place, with Champion Court finishing fourth.
2011/12 season.
Bobs Worth started his steeplechase career by winning the 2011 Berkshire Novices' Chase, beating former Champion Bumper winner Cue Card by a short head, with the two well clear of the other two runners. He then finished third in the Feltham Novices' Chase, about five lengths behind winner Grands Crus and two lengths behind runner-up Silviniaco Conti. Bobs Worth finished ahead of Silviniaco Conti in his next race, the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase, but was beaten two lengths into second by Invictus. At the 2012 Cheltenham Festival he contested the RSA Chase. Grands Crus started the race as the 6/5 favourite, with the previous year's Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle winner First Lieutenant and Bobs Worth next in the betting, both priced at 9/2. Bobs Worth was in the middle of the pack in the early stages and made progress though the field with eight fences still to jump, taking the lead four out. He was overtaken as they turned into the straight, but regained the lead at the final fence. He drew away near the finish to win by two and a half lengths from First Lieutenant. Call The Police was a further nine lengths back in third, with Grands Crus finishing fourth.
2012/13 season.
Carrying 11 stone 6 pounds, Bobs Worth started as the favourite for the Hennessy Gold Cup. He won the race by three and a quarter lengths from Tidal Bay. After the win he was immediately installed as the favourite for the 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup, at about 5/1. He was scheduled to take part in the Argento Chase in January, but was withdrawn by trainer Nicky Henderson. He did however take part in a racecourse gallop with Binocular and Long Run in February. 
On 15 March, Bobs Worth started the 11/4 favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He appeared unlikely to win after being hampered at the third last fence and was still eight lengths behind Long Run on the final turn. Geraghty, however, produced the horse with a strong run to take the lead approaching the final fence and Bobs Worth drew away from the field on the run-in to win by seven lengths from Sir Des Champs. His win took his career prize money earnings to £578,135 and made him the first horse since Flyingbolt in 1964-1966 to win three different races at the Cheltenham Festival in consecutive years.
2013/14 season.
Bobs Worth made his seasonal debut in the Betfair Chase at Haydock Park Racecourse in November and started 15/8 favourite in a strong field which included Silviniaco Conti, Long Run, Tidal Bay and Cue Card. He was never travelling well and was eased down by Geraghty when his chance had gone, finishing sixth, forty lengths behind the winner Cue Card. On 28 December 2013, Bobs Worth started 11/4 joint favourite with Sir Des Champs in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown, a race which also attracted the 2013 RSA Chase winner Lord Windermere. Racing on soft ground, Bobs Worth appeared to be struggling four fences out but stayed on strongly to take the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a half lengths from First Lieutenant, with Sir Des Champs fourth and Lord Windermere seventh of the nine runners. Henderson commented "I would have given anything to take him out two days ago. With the ground and the weather, I wasn't that happy with him, but the horse never stops surprising you".
On 14 March, Bobs Worth started 6/4 favourite ahead of Silviniaco Conti to become the first horse since Best Mate to win consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups. He was towards the rear of the field in the early stages, but made steady progress to challenge the leader Silviniaco Conti at the last, but the two leading contenders were overtaken by a trio of outsiders on the run-in and Bob Worth finished fifth behind Lord Windermere, On His Own, The Giant Bolster and Silviniaco Conti.

Wadham Preparatory School

Wadham Preparatory School was a private, day, co-educational, preparatory school founded on Christian principles. It was located on Wallis Avenue in Strathfield, New South Wales, Australia.
History.
The school was established in 1945 by Miss K A Wyndham in her family home and catered to children from pre-Kindergarten (known as nursery) to Year Six. In 1957, Wadham was purchased by Meriden, a neighbouring Anglican school, and was used as a sub-primary campus principally for girls, but also for nursery and kindergarten boys. In 1976, Meriden closed the Wadham campus having purchased land for its entire junior school in Redmyre Road, Strathfield.
Wyndham family.
Kathleen Aimee Wyndham was born in Forbes, New South Wales, in 1905 and was the middle of three children of Agnes Effie (née Finigan) and Stanley Charles Wyndham. She was a great-granddaughter of Wadham Wyndham and her grandfather, Alexander Wyndham (died 1915), had arrived in Australia in the 1850s. Her father was a grocer and furniture dealer in Forbes and after his wife died in 1908, he moved to Glebe with his children who were looked after by their aunt, Rachel Kate Finigan. Rachel Finigan, who had been a nurse, married Stanley Wyndham in 1911 and in 1912 the Wyndham family moved to Strathfield. Wyndham's elder brother was Sir Harold Wyndham CBE who was Director-General of Education in New South Wales between 1952 and 1968. He chaired the committee whose report (referred to as "The Wyndham Report") led to the Education Act of 1961 which completely re-organised secondary education in the State. Her younger brother, Norman Wyndham OBE, became a surgeon, a FRCS and a major in the Australian Army in World War II. From her father's second marriage she also had a half-brother, Robert. After studying to be a teacher Kathleen Wyndham became director of the kindergarten and primary department at the Methodist Ladies College in Burwood. In 1935 she undertook a seven months' tour of England, Scotland and the Continent to study the latest methods practised in early childhood education. In her youth she was a competitive grade tennis player.
Campus.
Wadham operated from the Wydham family home which had been named "Wadham" on its erection in 1912. Having been an early 20th Century house and garden, it was then adapted to school use. It had been built in the Federation style and was single storied with wrap-around verandahs and a central hall. After its closure, the building was demolished and two large 1970s style face-brick houses now stand in its place at 9 and 11 Wallis Avenue Strathfield.

Inn of the Damned

Inn of the Damned is a 1975 Australian horror film, directed by Terry Bourke.
Plot.
In 1896, a crazed woman and her husband run an inn in eastern Victoria and take revenge for the deaths of their children years before. An American bounty hunter arrives to investigate the mysterious deaths of many people and puts an end to the killing.
Production.
Like Bourke's previous feature, "Night of Fear", the movie was originally a one hour script intended for a projected TV series, "Fright".
It was filmed in the Mangrove Mountain region of the NSW Central Coast and at Artransa Studios in Sydney. Filming began in November 1973 and took nine weeks but the film was not released until late in 1975. Shooting was marred by disputes between the producers and its principal investor, Australian Film Development Corporation. At the time it was the most expensive local movie made in Australia.
Release.
Critical reception.
AllMovie called it "more odd than good", and "best viewed as a curiosity." DVD Verdict wrote, "as curiosities go, this Australian horror western (?) from the early '70s definitely deserves some attention."
Home video.
The film was released on DVD alongside 1972 Australian horror film "Night of Fear" (also directed by Bourke) by Umbrella Entertainment on 16 March 2005.

List of submissions to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film

This is a list of submissions to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film every year since the award was created in 1956. The award is presented annually by the Academy to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Nine shortlisted contenders will be revealed a week before the announcement of the Oscar nominations. 
The submitted motion pictures must be first released theatrically in their respective countries between October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2012.
On October 8, 2012, the Academy announced the final list of eligible submissions, with a record number of 71 films. Nine finalists were announced in December 2012, which were shortlisted in January, with the final five nominees announced on January 10, 2013. The Austrian entry "Amour" directed by Michael Haneke was the eventual winner.
Kenya submitted its first film in the Foreign Language category with "Nairobi Half Life". Cambodia made its first submission in 18 years (and its second overall) with "Lost Loves".
Other countries.
Bolivia's nominating body, the Asociación de Cineastas Bolivianos, proposed sending Jorge Sanjinés' "Insurgentes" to represent Bolivia, and invited the film's producers to assemble the necessary documents to enter the film in the race. However, citing time restraints, the film's representatives declined to participate. Bolivia had been absent the past two years in large part because no local films fully met all AMPAS requirements.
Cuba confirmed that it would not submit a film.
Iran's Academy confirmed their participation in the competition on September 21, 2012, noting however that they had considered boycotting the Oscars due to the "Innocence of Muslims" video on YouTube that originated in the United States, and planned to send a strongly worded letter to that effect. On September 24, it was announced that Iran's official selection committee had selected "A Cube of Sugar" by Reza Mirkarimi as the official Iranian submission. On the same day, the head of Iran's government controlled cinema agency called for a boycott of the Oscars and Reuters reported that Iran's Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister Mohammad Hosseini had confirmed that Iran would boycott.
Luxembourg announced that their national selection committee had met and decided not to send a film. The country last competed in 2009.

Vincenzo Russo

Vincenzo Russo obtained degrees in medicine from Nola and in law from Naples universities. Agreeing with the Jacobin principles of Robespierre, he joined two secret societies - the Club Rivoluzionario and the Società Patrottica - where he advocated the use of revolutionary, armed struggle against the Bourbon state in favour of the weakest in society. He was exiled for holding such “proto-communist” ideas.
Inspired by the French Revolution, Russo fled to Milan, then Switzerland, and then to Rome where he supported the Roman Republic of 1798-9, which was backed by France. During this period he took an active part in the cultural life of the republic, helping organise heated discussions in the democratic clubs and writing for the newly founded press.
He was among those who pressed the French into declaring Campania a republic. In the newly proclaimed Neapolitan Republic (also known as the Parthenopean Republic) he contributed to the “Monitore Napolitano”, the journal edited by Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, and went down to speak among the people.
However, the republic was short-lived: Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo soon counter-attacked with his army of Sanfedisti, fighting on the side of the Bourbon king (aided in this mainly by the British), and supported by an uprising of the royalist rabble, the Naples Lazzaroni. With weapons in hand, Russo was taken prisoner on 13 June 1799. He became a martyr to the cause of Italian Jacobinism at the age of 29 when he was hanged in Piazza del Mercato, Naples, on 19 November 1799. He was buried, according to one source, on the seashore near the Ponte della Maddalena, Naples, for refusing to utter the required words just prior to execution. A later source gives his last resting place as the Church of San Matteo al Lavinaio, Naples.
Political thought.
In his most important work, “Pensieri politici”, published in Rome in 1798, Russo puts forward a socio-political theory of a peasant state, founded on justice and barbarism, where the degree of egalitarianism was to exceed even that of Louis Saint-Just. An individual's freedom from want would be based on the tenancy of a piece of land belonging to the community, and not on hereditary property.
Russo establishes a legitimate property limit at just the amount needed to satisfy a person's basic needs; such a limit would be “calculated” from a combination of the needs of each individual and the amount required to secure his or her economic freedom and equality to other members of the community. So, for Russo, economic equality is the essential precondition for genuine political equality. But such equality would only be possible in small communities, such as the Ancient Greek polis, as had been suggested by Plato and Jean Jacques Rousseau. For both these thinkers, the city should be limited in size in order to guarantee the effective participation of all citizens in the political process. A public system of general education would be necessary in order for everyone to take part in the running of the community in an informed way.
Given the close link between landed property and political awareness in Russo's ideal state, it could be likened to a “republic of peasant-philosophers”. He therefore rejects industrial development and commerce on the basis that they would create, respectively, unhealthy living conditions for workers, and a craving for ever more wealth to the detriment of an honest and simple life. Sections 23-5 of his “Pensieri politici” contain the fundamentals of his thought on the questions of commerce, agriculture and the city.

Philadelphia Game Lab

Philadelphia Game Lab (PGL) is a non-profit organization (501c3), with the mission of facilitating growth and visibility of small-team development in the Philadelphia region. Currently, PGL is executing a number of funded game development and game technology projects, including sonic, a low level toolset for creation of audio-only games, and lux, a platform for creation of collaborative games. Both are being developed under a permissive MIT License.
Location.
PGL operates from the 8th floor of the Benjamin's Desk building at 1701 Walnut Street.
Funding.
PGL's core initiative, funded development of games and game technologies by current students and recent graduates of Pennsylvania universities, is backed by a D2PA Grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
History.
Nathan Solomon founded PGL in late 2011. Philadelphia Game Lab compares itself to diverse initiatives, including Boston's MassDiGI, Toronto's Hand Eye Society, New York University's Game Center, and creative facilitators/organizations such as The Wild Rumpus, Babycastles and Juegosrancheros. Solomon said of the Philadelphia business environment: "We should emphasize bootstrapped entities, and reject the model of massive scalability (required by the conventional tech VC model), as the primary requirement of a tech startup. I'm not saying that if someone is offered funding and takes it, that's a bad thing (it's definitely a very good thing); however, this city should brand itself as so good for bootstrapping that it has unique value that cannot be found in NYC or San Francisco or even Boston." Regarding locating in Philadelphia, Solomon said, "From a hard numbers perspective, Philadelphia probably has the lowest per-capita number of professional game developers for a city its size in North America. At the same time, though, Philadelphia is a great place for creative and technical initiatives, and I think there's a valid argument that we're uniquely strong in grassroots initiatives here, especially those for social or creative good."
Grassroots Game Conference.
First held in from April 23 to April 28 in 2012 in coordination with Philly Tech Week, the Grassroots Game Conference is an annual event which targets game developers, as well as those involved in arts, non-profits, and education. The conference is dedicated to facilitating "small team" game development, with tracks in Games and Art, Games and Music, and Games and Gamification for Non-profits. The conference differs from-user-focused events such the Penny Arcade Expo and ComicCon, events focused on professional developers such as the Game Developers Conference and retail event Electronic Entertainment Expo. Similar events include Indiecade and the Games for Change Festival.
Nationally recognized game developers and educators spoke at the 2012 event, including representatives from the Smithsonian, the National Endowment for the Arts, and GlitchLabs. Gabe Zichermann, a gamification expert, gave the keynote speech.
The 2013 Grassroots Game Conference was significantly larger than 2012, including more events and additional interest tracks, as well as international presenters.

Night of Fear (film)

Night of Fear is a 1972 Australian horror film, directed by Terry Bourke. It was written by Bourke and produced by Rod Hay. It is about a woman who is terrorised by a serial killer in the woods. Its theme and style bears a resemblance to the horror classic "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", released two years later. The film is notable for having no dialogue or character names. It has been called "the first Australian horror movie of the renaissance".
The film was featured in the documentary "".
Plot.
A young woman crashes her car on a lonely country road. She is terrorised by a crazed hermit.
Production.
The film was shot over twelve days in mid 1972. It was originally intended to be a pilot for TV series called "Fight". The Australian Broadcasting Commission provided a crew and 35mm production facilities in exchange for television rights.
Release.
The film was initially banned in Australia by the OFLC. The makers of "Night of Fear" appealed to the review board and it was released in November 1972 with an 'R' (18+) rating. It has since been re-classified 'M' (15+).
The film enjoyed a profitable run in independent cinemas and drive ins.
Critical reception.
AllMovie wrote, ""Night of Fear" is a potent, no-frills little shocker that is likely to delight fans of vintage horror", complimenting its "excellent use of whiplash-speed editing, bizarre camera angles and a densely layered soundtrack to create a consistently unnerving atmosphere."
Home video.
The film was released on DVD alongside fellow Australian horror film "Inn of the Damned" (also directed by Bourke) by Umbrella Entertainment on 16 March 2005.

Job Edward Lousley

Job Edward Lousley or Ted Lousley (18 September 1907 – 6 January 1976) was a banker by career, a renowned amateur botanist and an author of many publications including ″Wild Flowers of Chalk and Limestone″ (Number 16) in the New Naturalist series and the first flora of the Isles of Scilly published in 1971.
Family and early life.
Ted Lousley was born in 1907 at Clapham, London, England, and was the only son of Jethro Lousley MBE (1882 – 1963) and Christine Clarke (c. 1880 – 1945) who was of Huguenot stock. He married Dorothy Winifred Thorpe (c. 1910 – 19 January 2009) and they had one child, Margaret. He went to Strand Grammar School, Brixton, and Selhurst Grammar School, Norbury, and as a schoolboy of 12 or 13 developed an interest in natural history. Along with a group of other like-minded schoolboys he was invited to use the facilities of the South London Botanical Institute and to go on field trips, mainly in the Surrey countryside, with the then curator W. R. Sherrin whose main interest was bryophytes.
Botany.
He left school in April 1924 and worked for ten years for Barclays Bank in South London before moving to the City and working in the Stock Exchange, various city branches and the Trustee Department of Head Office. At the age of 19 he was serving on the council of the British Empire Naturalists Association. He also joined the Watson Botanical Exchange Club in 1926 and the Botanical Society and Exchange Club of the British Isles the following year. He was now meeting or corresponding with other botanists in Britain and gained a reputation for having an intimate knowledge of the British flora.
He realised at an early age the need to specialise and chose docks ("Rumex"), a neglected group, which was to gain him an international reputation. He published two papers in 1939 and 1944 that settled the differences between Patience Dock ("Rumex patientia") and "Rumex cristatus" and found aliens such as "Rumex confertus" hybridizing with native species. He named "Rumex wrightii" ("R conglomeratus x R frutescens" and "R cuneifolius"), as new to science. Up until the Second World War he gained his knowledge of the British flora by travelling to every part of the British Isles collecting what was to be the largest private herbarium in the British Isles. He first visited the Isles of Scilly in September 1936 and added Western Ramping–fumitory ("Fumaria occidentalis") to the flora. He returned over the next four years covering every month from March to September and recording many additional species. The first manuscript of the flora was completed in 1941 and the work was finally published in 1971. 
During the Second World War he worked in London which gave him the chance to visit bombed sites and he went on to list species in the Square Mile. It led, in collaboration with Richard Fitter, to the "Natural History of the City" published in 1953 which listed 269 wild flowers, grasses and ferns. He was the first to discover American Willow–herb ("Epilobium ciliatum") in 1945 which is now abundant in England. He also named a new hybrid "Senecio" discovered by N. Y. Sandwith which he named London Ragwort ("Senecio x londinensis"). With further work on plants introduced by the woollen industry in shoddy he became an authority on introductions. 
In 1950 he was author of "Wild Flowers of Chalk and Limestone" (No. 103 in the New Naturalist series) and in the same year he became the secretary of the BSBI, on the death of A. J. Wilmott. He was the honorary curator of the South London Botanical Institute (1955–68) and in 1963 he was the first recipient of the H. H. Bloomer Award of the Linnean Society of London. On retirement in 1967, at the age of 60, he was a Departmental Manager with Barclays Bank.
He died in 1976 at Streatham Common and his herbarium was donated to the University of Reading, and some of his notebooks, photos, papers, letters and the manuscript of the flora of Scilly are held in the archives of the Isles of Scilly Museum.

Imagine (horse)

Imagine (foaled 20 February 1998) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Epsom Oaks in 2001. In a racing career which lasted from August 2000 to June 2001 the filly ran ten times times and won four races. As a two-year-old, Imagine ran six times, winning the Group Three C. L. Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh and finishing second in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket. The following spring, the filly was beaten in her first two races before winning the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Imagine recorded her most valuable success on her final appearance, winning the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She never raced again, but proved to be a successful broodmare.
Background.
Imagine is a dark-coated bay mare sired by the thirteen time Champion sire Sadler's Wells. She was the last foal of her dam, the American bred mare Doff the Derby, who had become famous a decade earlier as the dam of the Epsom Derby winner Generous. Doff the Derby was a half-sister of the leading racemare Trillion, who in turn produced the multiple Group One winner Triptych. Imagine was bred by a partnership between Barronstown Stud, who owned Doff the Derby, and Orpendale, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore organisation. Like many Coolmore horses, Imagine was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. The filly usually raced in the colours of Susan Magnier, the wife of John Magnier although she was partly owned by Diane Nagle one of the owners of Barronstown.
Racing career.
2000: two-year-old season.
Imagine initially bypassed maiden races, making her first appearance in the Listed Debutante Stakes at the Curragh in August 2000 and finishing third behind the more experienced fillies Affianced and Sequoyah. She was then moved up to Group One level for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course two weeks later. Ridden by the British veteran George Duffield, she finished sixth of the ten runners behind Sequoyah. Eleven days later Imagine was dropped in class for maiden race at Gowran Park and recorded her first win, ridden for the first time by Mick Kinane. Nine days late, Imagine was sent to England to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot. She led for most of the way, but weakened in the closing stages and finished fourth to Crystal Music. On 30 September, Imagine, running for the fifth time in forty-one days contested the Group Three C. L. Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh. Starting the 5/2 favourite against eleven other fillies, she led from the start and held the late challenge of Katherine Seymour to win by half a length. Imagine's final appearance of 2000 came in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket in October. In a close and rough finish, Imagine overcame interference to finish third, beaten a short head and half a length by Sayedah and Katherine Seymour, but was promoted to second place when the runner-up was disqualified after a steward's inquiry.
2001: three-year-old season.
Imagine reappeared as a three-year-old in the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes in April. She started the 9/10 favourite but was beaten five and a half lengths by the easy winner Rebelline. On 7 May, Imagine was made favourite for the Listed Athasi Stakes but finished third behind Cool Clarity and Rose Gypsy. The field for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh included Rebelline, Cool Clarity, Sequoyah, Katherine Seymour and Crystal Music, who started favourite, while Imagine was not fancied and started a 16/1 outsider. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, Imagine was restrained in the early stages before moving up to fourth place a quarter of a mile from the finish. Imagine took the lead just inside the final furlong and ran on strongly to win by two lengths from Crystal Music. Imagine's win, which came one day after O'Brien had trained the first three horses in the Irish 2000 Guineas, enabled Sadler's Wells to equal the record of 45 individual Group One/Grade I set by Sir Tristram.
Twelve days after her win in the Irish classic, Imagine started 3/1 favourite against thirteen opponents in the Epsom Oaks. O'Brien had not been able to run his horses in Britain earlier in the season because of restrictions on the movement of livestock imposed as a result of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ridden by Kinane, Imagine was restrained at the back of the field in the early stages and seemed to be struggling just after halfway as she seemed unable to handle the downhill section of the course. She turned into the straight in eighth place but then made steady progress down the centre of the course to challenge the leader Relish the Thought inside the last quarter mile. Imagine overtook Relish the Thought 150 yards from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths with the fast-finishing second favourite Flight of Fancy (owned by the Queen) taking second place in the last strides. The first three were all daughters of Sadler's Wells. After the race O'Brien said that Imagine was "an amazing filly to win like that when it was ground she didn't like."
Shortly after the Oaks, Imagine sustained an injury (described by O'Brien as a "stone bruise") which interrupted her training. During her break she gained a great deal of weight and it proved impossible to bring her back to peak fitness for a run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In September it was announced that she would be retired from racing.
Assessment and honours.
In the 2001 International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), Imagine was given a rating of 117, making her the equal tenth best three-year-old filly in the world (and the third best in Europe), six pounds below the top-rated Banks Hill.
The independent Timeform organisation gave Imagine a rating of 119.
Stud record.
Imagine was retired to become a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud, and proved highly successful. Her first foal was Horatio Nelson, by Danehill who won the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere and was fatally injured when second favourite for the 2006 Epsom Derby. She went on to produce the Group Two winners Viscount Nelson and Kitty Matcham as well as Red Rock Canyon, who won only one minor race but acted as pacemaker for the Ballydoyle champions Dylan Thomas and Duke of Marmalade.

Plan of Cuernavaca

The Plan of Cuernavaca (Spanish: "Plan de Cuernavaca") was a declaration made in Cuernavaca, Mexico on 25 May 1834 in opposition to reform measures by the liberal administration of Vice President Valentín Gómez Farías. 
Presumably the declaration was orchestrated by President Antonio López de Santa Anna in agreement with the high clergy.
After the triumph of the Plan of Cuernavaca, all laws enacted by the progressives during ten months in office were repealed, 
the Pontifical and National University of Mexico was reopened, Congress was dissolved and the officials who implemented the reform measures were dismissed. 
Santa Anna's first dictatorship began. 
A year later, the conservative faction of the Congress approved the basis for the new constitution that gave rise to the centralist regime in Mexico.
Background.
In March 1833, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was elected as President and Valentín Gómez Farías as Vice-President of Mexico. 
They alternated leadership of the executive branch due to the frequent absences of Santa Anna.
These were sometimes so that he could personally combat military uprisings, and sometimes to "restore his failing health."
While Vice President Gómez Farías was at the head of government, he implemented reform measures affecting the interests of both the army and the Catholic Church. 
A law was proposed to expand the militias controlled by the States, which would relieve the federal budget. 
This law, and a discussion about disposal of church property by the States, led to the rebellions of Escalda and Durán in support of "Religion and privileges." 
Santa Anna asked Congress for permission to take command of the army and combat the rebels. 
In response to these rebellions, in June 1833 Congress passed the famous "Ley del Caso" (Case Law) that ordered opponents of the reformist regime into exile. 
In November 1833, Congress issued a decree that ordered dissolution of army corps which had rebelled against federal institutions.
In ecclesiastical matters, mandatory tithing was removed, 
the hospices and farms of the Philippines missionaries were placed in charge of the Federation, and the College of Santa María de Todos Santos and the Pontifical and National University of Mexico were closed. 
In its place, the Department of Public Instruction for the Federal District and Territories was created.
Congress ordered creation of primary schools, schools for secular education of primary school teachers, and schools for women and girls.
The property of the California missions was seized. 
On 17 December 1833, Congress issued a decree that authorized the government to fill parish vacancies. 
This was exercised in some States in the same way that the viceroys had used the power of royal patronage. 
Bishops and governors of bishoprics who did not comply with this decree would be fined on the first two occasions, and banished from the country after a third offense. 
In Jalisco and Tamaulipas, government funding of religion was declared.
In Durango and the State of Mexico the governors exercised their patronage.
In Michoacán the local legislature regulated observance of the canons and discipline of the clergy.
Religious tolerance was declared in Yucatán. 
On 13 March 1834 there was an earthquake, with aftershocks on 15 and 21 March, and on 24 March there was a severe thunderstorm with hail and water saturated with sulfur. 
These events were interpreted as "divine signs" by some priests, who urged the population to oppose the new reform laws.
Resistance by the high clergy, supported by Santa Anna.
In November 1833, Santa Anna asked Congress for permission to be absent for six months to replenish his "failing health" at the hacienda of Manga Clavo. 
At this place he received and heard complaints from the opponents of Vice President Valentín Gómez Farías's reform regime, including a letter from the Bishop of Puebla, Francisco Pablo Vázquez, who called the law of 17 December "a sacrilegious statement against the divine authority of the Pope." 
Meanwhile, the Bishop of Monterrey, José María de Jesús Belaunzarán y Ureña, announced he was willing to pay the fines and suffer exile before enforcing the new law.
The Bishop of Chiapas, Luis García Guillén, Governor of the Guadalajara bishopric, Diego de Aranda y Carpinteiro, governor of Oaxaca bishopric, Florencio del Castillo, and the Bishop of Michoacán, Juan Cayetano Gómez de Portugal y Solís refused to obey the law of December 17. 
In contrast, the governor of Sonora bishopric, Orrantia Francisco, and the governor of Yucatán bishopric, Jose Maria Meneses, were willing to obey the reform laws.
Later the first was disowned and deposed, while the second asked to exculpate himself before the council.
Santa Anna took the side that defended the interests of the Church. 
On 12 March 1834 he sent a long letter to Gómez Farías expressing dissatisfaction with the directives and agreements that the government had made.
On 20 April, the town of Orizaba opposed the decree of the local Legislature that ordered the convents of San José de Gracia and del Carmen to be closed. 
The rebellion of the people took some lives, but failed to prevent enforcement of the law.
Two days later, Congress enacted a 30 day extension before the law of 17 December would be rigidly enforced, after which bishops, councils or governors of bishoprics 
who did not comply would lose their posts and would be expelled from the country.
On 24 April, before the expiration of his six-months leave, Santa Anna returned to Mexico City. 
Five days later he published a manifesto in which he informed the public of the bitter division between reformists and conservatives, 
and declared himself impartial and ready to enforce the Constitution to preserve the rights of citizens. 
In the first days of May, he issued a decree for the people of Veracruz to return to order, restoring local authorities. 
He order the disarmament of the civic militia in face of protests by their commander, Lucas Balderas, and suggested to Congress that they should abolish the "Ley del Caso".
Dismayed, the members of the Chamber sent a delegation to ask the President whether or not they had the freedom to legislate. 
Santa Anna replied, "they have, but to do what is right and no more, because I make the Constitution with one hand and in the other hold the sword to ensure it is observed.
I had the resolution to attack tyranny, and I will have the resolution to fight demagogy." 
Given this response, on 15 May Congress decided to suspend its activities since it lacked freedom, "reserving the right to continue at such the time as it saw fit." 
Congress based its decision on Article 69 of the Rules of Procedure, and prorogued its session. 
However, Santa Anna decided to summon the Congress for 21 May, show he was not adverse to the legislature power.
Proclamation of the plan of Cuernavaca.
On 16 May, in Xalapa and Coatepec, Santa Anna was proclaimed "protector of the Catholic religion." 
On 23 May, in Oaxaca, he was proclaimed "sustainer of religion and freedom of the country". 
Finally, on 25 May in the town of Cuernavaca, Ignacio Echeverria and Jose Mariano Campos proclaimed the Plan of Cuernavaca, containing five articles that demanded:
The plan and its declaration had been orchestrated by José María Tornel, governor of the Federal District.
On the day that the plan was announced, Tornel issued a decree subjecting the press to censorship and making it a crime to publish posters that offended the regime.
Tornel ensured that news of support for the plan by other garrisons was given full publicity.
The plan was followed a week later by the "Plan of Toluca", issued by the garrison of the State of Mexico,
which threw out the governor and the federalist state legislature.
Between 25 May and 11 June the following towns issued declarations in support of the Plan of Cuernavaca and of safeguarding the Catholic religion:
Tlaxcala, Huitzuco, Chignahuapan, 
Mazatepec, Iguala, Chiautempan, Zacapoaxtla, Huejotzingo, Tepecoacuilco, Ixtlahuaca, Santa María Nativitas, Tlacotepec, San Agustín del Palmar, Tenancingo, Toluca, Tecualoya, San Salvador el Verde, San Martín Texmelucan, Misantla, Tehuacán, Huexotla, Malinalco, San Andrés Tuxtla, Teolitlán, Teziutlán, Joquicingo, Colima, San Juan Teotihuacán, San Pablo del Monte, Aquixtla, Otumba, Apan, Coronango, Totolapan, San Martín Xaltocan, Todos Santos Zempoala, Tulancingo, Chalco, Santa María Ozumba, Santiago Tetla, San Nicolás Panotla, Jiutepec, San Ildefonso Hueyotlipan, Cuautitlán, Azcapotzalco, Santa Inés Zacatelco, Maravatío, Iguala, Tepotzotlán, Santa Ana Monte Alto, Tula, Tlalmanalco, Tlayacapan, San Andrés Chalchicomula, Tepeaca, Santa María Tultepec, San Salvador Atenco, Tenango Tepopola, Contepec, Xochitepec, Singuilucan, Tianguismanalco, Ixtapaluca, Amecameca, Cadereyta, Ixmiquilpan, San Juan del Río, Tecali, Coyoacán, Zimapán, Atlixco, Santo Domingo Mixcoac, Actopan, Mineral de Cardonal, Acatzingo, Atotonilco el Grande, San Ángel, Tacubaya, San Pedro Tolimán, Tlaxcoapan, Santiago de Querétaro, Santiago Tulyehualco, Tacuba, San Agustín Tlaxco, Pachuca, Celaya, Irapuato, Huascazaloya, and the parish of Santa Catarina Mártir in Mexico City.
The pronouncements were not uniform. 
Sometimes they specifically said they only wanted to throw out the religious reforms, but wanted to retain the federal form of government.
However, the wave of supporting proclamations gave Santa Anna the justification he needed to close Congress and repeal the unpopular legislation.
The lack of support for the Congress indicated that the general population, with its traditional support for religion, considered that Congress no longer represented their views and resented its exercise of power. 
When members of the Chamber wanted to meet, they found that the room keys had been collected and that the doors were guarded by an armed force. 
In response to the demands of the legislators, Santa Anna replied that the meetings could not continue beyond the period specified by the Constitution. 
On 1 June he defined his position in another public manifesto, which expressed willingness to defend the people's wishes to maintain the Catholic religion unharmed, 
saying he had "begged" to the Chambers to repeal the laws to stop the upheavals and religious fears.
Nine days after the Plan of Cuernavaca had been published, the Church agreed to pay Santa Anna from 30,000 to 40,000 pesos monthly as long as church privileges were maintained. 
On 12 June, Santa Anna threw off his mask, dissolved the council and announced his decision to adopt the Plan of Cuernavaca. 
The church bells pealed and signs were posted reading "Long Live Religion and the illustrious Santa Anna." 
On 14 June, the new council of the capital supported the president's decision. 
The same day, Bishop Juan Cayetano Gomez de Portugal led Mass at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City and sang the Te Deum.
The people hailed the president's decision.
Reactions and consequences.
Several municipalities in the country continued to adhere to the plan and support the decision of Santa Anna.
On 24 June in Mexico City, Santa Anna abolished the law of Ecclesiastical Trusts issued on 17 December 1833 and ratified on 24 April 1834. 
At the same time he appointed Juan Cayetano Gómez de Portugal y Solís as Secretary of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs in place of Andrés Quintana Roo.
On 9 July he issued a call for election of new Members of Congress. 
On 26 July he approved the appointment of the bishop of Yucatán, José María Guerra y Rodríguez Correa. 
Two days later he suspended the arrest warrant issued against Lucas Alamán and the process that was being followed against Anastasio Bustamante for the murder of Vicente Guerrero.
On 30 July, repealed the "Ley del Caso". 
On 1 August he ordered restoration of the Papal and National University of Mexico. 
On 8 August, he ordered the reinstatement of the judges of the Supreme Court who had been dismissed in March.
A month later, on 8 September 1834, Valentin Gomez Farias went into exile in Mexico en route to New Orleans.
Events in the city of Puebla followed a different course. 
Before the proclamation of the Plan of Cuernavaca, the civic militia had proclaimed a local plan to support the Catholic religion and had urged the local legislature to declare the same. Although some deputies joined with the militia's wishes, President Pedro Pablo Carrillo was not in the room, so a picket of militia forced him to attend the sessions. 
The Congress of Puebla refused to deliberate until the militia had been withdrawn. 
The deputies decided not to accept the plan announced by the militia and decided to keep the reform institutions "even at the cost of a bloody war." 
Meanwhile, Santa Anna tried to overthrow the state government. 
The governor, Cosme Furlong, had only three thousand men, who were besieged by federal troops of General Luis Quintanar with seven thousand troops and thirty guns. 
On 13 and 29 June the besiegers made assaults that were repelled,
but on 5 July 5 they managed to occupy the Inns of Cristo and the Roncal.
On 16 July, the besiegers opened negotiations with representatives of the governor, Agustín M. Callejo, Juan José Sánchez and the priest Apolinario Zacarías. 
After long discussions with General Luis de Quintanar, they left for the capital for talks with the president. 
On 26 July there was a peace agreement, in which Santa Anna promised to preserve the federal system and designate Guadalupe Victoria as commanding general. 
Although the militants felt betrayed, the city was surrendered on 1 August. 
Cosme Furlong handed over the state government to General Victoria.
With rumors of the establishment of a centralized system, the governments of Zacatecas, Coahuila and Texas strengthened their militias. 
Aguascalientes was separated from Zacatecas in May 1835. 
The rumors were confirmed when Congress declared that the centralized system was constitutional and implemented it on 23 October 1835. 
This policy led to the Independence of Texas and, years later, the separation of Yucatán.
