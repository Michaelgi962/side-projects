Curse tablet

A curse tablet or binding spell (; κατάδεσμος "katadesmos" in Greek) is a type of curse found throughout the Greco-Roman world, in which someone would ask the gods to do harm to others.
Description.
These texts were typically scratched on very thin sheets of lead in tiny letters, then often rolled, folded, or pierced with nails. These bound tablets were then usually placed beneath the ground: either buried in graves or tombs, thrown into wells or pools, sequestered in underground sanctuaries, or nailed to the walls of temples. Tablets were also used for love spells and, when used in this manner they were placed inside the home of the desired target. They are sometimes discovered along with small dolls or figurines (sometimes inaccurately referred to as "Voodoo dolls"), which may also be pierced by nails. The figurines resembled the target and often had both their feet and hands bound. Curse tablets also included hair or pieces of clothing. This is especially the case in love spells, which calls for “hair from the head of the love target.” Some love spells have even been discovered “folded around some hair,” probably to bind the spell itself. “Not all tablets included a personal name, but it is clear especially in the Roman period, that tablets were sometimes prepared in advance, with space left for inserting the names provided by paying customers."
The texts on curse tablets are typically addressed to infernal or liminal gods such as Pluto, Charon, Hecate, and Persephone, sometimes via the mediation of a dead person (probably the corpse in whose grave the tablet was deposited). Some texts do not invoke the gods, however, but merely list the targets of the curse, the crimes or conditions upon which the curse is valid, and/or the intended ill to befall them. Some tablets are inscribed with nothing more than the names of the targets, leading to the supposition that an oral spell may have accompanied the manufacture of the curse. The texts on the tablets were not always curses; tablets were also used to help the dead. Those at whose grave sites these were placed had usually died at a very young age or in a violent manner, and the tablet was supposed to help lay their souls to rest in spite of their untimely deaths. The language of those texts that do give context is often concerned with justice, either listing the target's crimes in great detail, handing over responsibility for their punishment to the gods, using indefinite grammar ("whoever committed this crime"), or conditional ("if he is guilty"), or even future conditional ("if he ever breaks his word").. Frequently, such curse tablets are also inscribed with additional, otherwise meaningless "curse" words such as Bazagra, Bescu, or Berebescu, seemingly in order to lend them a kind of supernatural efficacy.
Many of those discovered at Athens refer to court cases and curse the opposing litigant, asking ("May he...") that he botch his performance in court, forget his words, become dizzy and so forth. Others include erotic binding-spells, spells ranged against thieves, and business and sporting rivals. Those curse tablets targeted at thieves or other criminals may have been more public, more acceptable; some scholars even refuse to apply the word "curse" to such "positive" texts, preferring expressions such as "judicial prayers".
In 1979/1980, the Bath curse tablets were found at the site of "Aquae Sulis" (now Bath in England). The curses in the 130 tablets mostly concerned the theft of clothes whilst the victim was bathing. Over 80 more have similarly been discovered in and about the remains of a temple to Mercury nearby, at West Hill, Uley, making south-western Britain one of the major centres for finds of Latin "defixiones".
In Ancient Egypt, so-called "Execration Texts" appear around the time of the 12th Dynasty, listing the names of enemies written on clay figurines or pottery which were then smashed and buried beneath a building under construction (so that they were symbolically "smothered"), or in a cemetery.
"Voces mysticae".
"Voces mysticae" are words not immediately recognizable as belonging to any known language, and are commonly associated with curse tablets. Anthropologist Stanely J. Tambiah proposed in 1968 that such words were intended to represent "the language that demons can understand".
Scholars from antiquity, like Christian philosopher Clement of Alexandria (ca. 200 CE), believed that human language was not appropriate for addressing the gods. Therefore, some of the inscriptions of these curse tablets are not easily translatable, because they were "invocations and secret names" which would only be understood by the spirits themselves. Another possibility is that curse tablets were produced by professionals who wished to lend their art a degree of mystique through the use of an apparently secret language that only they could understand. In support of this theory, at least some tablets appear to have blank spaces instead of a name for the target, suggesting they were prepared in advance, and that the desired target's name would be added on behalf of the customer.
Historiography.
Magic was used by the people of the Greco-Roman society to control the natural. All members of society, regardless of economic or class status, used such magic. There have been roughly 1600 curse tablets discovered, mostly written in Greek. Of those tablets, 220 were located in Attica.
The first set of curse tablets to be discovered came from the city of Selinus in Sicily. A total of twenty-two tablets were found, mostly coming from the early fifth century, and directed toward someone that the user was suing. While the ancient Greeks may have feared the power of these tablets, some historians have compared the tablets to modern swearing, arguing that they were produced in a fit of anger, in envy towards a business competitor or athletic opponent, or in an unhealthy obsession toward a person of romantic interest.
When research first began on the topic of curse tablets, there was serious doubt that these types of artifacts truly came from ancient Greek society. E. R. Dodds, a professor of Greek at Oxford, was one of the first scholars to begin studying the topic of magic or superstition in ancient Greece, and others such as Peter Green have also studied this aspect of ancient Greek society.
Erotic magic.
Scholars have debated the possible motivations for using erotic magic, including unrequited love, sexual control of the “victim”, financial gain, and social advancement. The love spells used were similar in design around the Mediterranean world, and could be adjusted to different situations, users and intended victims. Recent scholarship has shown that women used curse tablets for erotic magic much more than originally thought, although they were still in a minority.
There is also debate over the type of women that men were trying to attract with these spells. Some scholars subscribe to the idea of men trying to make fair, chaste women become filled with desire for them, while others argue that men were trying to control women whom they thought to be sexually active for their own personal benefit. Christopher A. Faraone considered the spells to fall into two distinct categories; spells used for inducing passion and spells used for encouraging affection. Men, according to Faraone, were the primary users of the passion-inducing spells, while women were the main users of the affection spells.

John Rudge

John Robert Rudge (born 21 October 1944) is an English former football player and football manager.
His playing career began at Huddersfield Town in November 1961, but he made little impact at the club and was transferred to Carlisle United in December 1967. In January 1969 he joined Torquay United, and twice finished as the club's top scorer, before he moved on to Bristol Rovers in February 1972. He helped the club to win promotion of the Third Division in 1973–74, before departing for Bournemouth in March 1975. His time on the coast was disrupted by injury, and he retired in 1977. He scored a total of 79 goals in 230 league and cup appearances in a sixteen-year career in the Football League.
He managed Port Vale for a sixteen-year period between 1983 to 1999, easily the longest spell in the club's history. He masterminded some of the club's most successful ever campaigns, leading them to promotion in 1985–86, 1989 and 1993–94; he also led them to the Anglo-Italian Cup final in 1996, and to victory in the Football League Trophy final in 1993. However he was sacked in January 1999, and subsequently was appointed director of football at their rivals – Stoke City, a position he held until May 2013.
Playing career.
Born and raised in Wolverhampton, Rudge became a lifelong fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers. However he turned professional at Second Division club Huddersfield Town in November 1961. He made his debut under manager Eddie Boot in the 1962–63 campaign, and was given the residence of the recently departed Denis Law. He did not feature in 1963–64, appeared just twice in 1964–65, and did not get a game in 1965–66. He played two games at the start of the 1966–67 season, before manager Tom Johnston allowed him a move to Second Division rivals Carlisle United in December 1967.
Rudge made an immediate impact at Brunton Park, scoring seven goals in 14 appearances, as Tim Ward's "Cumbrians" finished third in 1966–67, six points short of promotion. Over the course of the 1967–68 campaign he scored nine goals in 29 league and cup games, as Carlisle posted a tenth place finish. He made just five goalless appearances in 1968–69, and in January 1969 manager Bob Stokoe handed him a free transfer to Torquay United of the Third Division.
He found the net just twice in 14 appearances before the end of the campaign for Allan Brown's "Gulls". He then found his form in 1969–70, finishing as the club's top scorer with 16 goals in 35 league and cup matches. He continued to regularly find the net in 1970–71, hitting 21 goals in 43 appearances, as Torquay finished tenth. However he scored just twice in 12 games in 1971–72, as the club suffered relegation under Jack Edwards. Rudge escaped this fate as he left Plainmoor in February 1972, signing a contract with Bill Dodgin's Bristol Rovers.
After three goals in eight games towards the end of the campaign, Rudge hit 12 goals in 29 appearances in 1972–73, as the club pushed for promotion under new manager Don Megson. The "Pirates" achieved their goal in 1973–74, as they finished runners-up of the as Third Division; however Rudge played only 15 games, scoring five goals. He featured just three times in 1974–75, and moved on to John Benson's Bournemouth in March 1975.
Rudge played seven games for the "Cherries", and could not prevent them from being relegated into the Fourth Division at the end of the campaign. He missed most of the 1975–76 season with a ruptured Achilles tendon, and made only 11 league appearances in 1976–77, scoring twice. His career was ended at age 32, owing to his achilles-tendon injury. He had scored a total of 79 goals in 230 appearances in all competitions.
Managerial career.
Following his retirement as a player, Rudge was made a coach at old club Torquay United. In January 1980 he was appointed as a coach at Port Vale, after Rudge was recommended to new manager John McGrath. Rudge was promoted to the position of assistant manager in December 1980.
Following the sacking of McGrath in December 1983, Rudge was made caretaker manager at Port Vale. Under McGrath, the club had lost thirteen of their opening seventeen league games. The club had the third highest budget in the division, the weekly wage bill three times that of the home gate receipts and were rooted to the foot of the table, nine points from their nearest competitors. Rudge understated things somewhat when he said: "We cannot change things overnight." However, player Tommy Gore noted "the players are in a more determined mood." He signed left sided midfielder Kevin Young on loan, and switched Eamonn O'Keefe from midfield to the attack. He was unable to prevent relegation that year, though the club did avoid picking up the wooden spoon. Though Mark Bright and Robbie Earle were signed to Vale before Rudge's appointment, he helped to nurture their talents, both were the first of many to develop into outstanding players under Rudge.
In reality, the task in 1984–85 was to arrest the decline. Rudge achieved this aim, slashing the wage bill to offset the club's reduced income, the Vale finished 12th. Young striker Andy Jones was purchased for £3,000 from Rhyl.
In 1985–86, promotion was the target. An eighteen game unbeaten run from January to April helped to win Vale a fourth place promotion place, seven points clear of fifth place Leyton Orient. At the end of the season, Rudge turned down an offer of the management job at Preston North End.
Major signings for the start of the 1986–87 season were Mark Grew and Ray Walker, who would feature heavily for the club in the coming years, as well as Paul Smith. Smith was purchased for £10,000 from Sheffield United and was sold for four times that figure to Lincoln City just over a year later. The club finished mid-table, twelve points above the drop. The winter signing of veteran Bob Hazell helped to shore up the Vale's defence. At the end of the season, Bill Bell was made the club's chairman. Also Darren Beckford was signed from Manchester City for £15,000. He would become the club's top scorer for the next four seasons.
In 1987–88, Vale were once again comfortable in mid-table. The cash-flow problem was eased by the sale of Andy Jones to Charlton Athletic for £350,000. Rudge spent £75,000 for Simon Mills from York City, who would be a firm fixture in the first team for the next five seasons. On 20 January the club achieved a famous 2–0 victory over top-flight Spurs in the FA Cup. Before the cup run there were rumours that the directors were considering sacking Rudge due to a poor run of results in the league. The cup run and the sale of Jones helped to put the club in the black financially for the first time in a long time.
The 1988–89 season was highly successful, the club beating Bristol Rovers in the play-off Final. For the first time in thirty two years, Vale were in the Second Division. A new club record was set in January 1989, as Rudge purchased classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for £200,000.
To boost the side for the oncoming 1989–90 season, defender Neil Aspin was purchased from Leeds United for £150,000, Aspin would play over 300 games for Vale in the next ten years. £125,000 was splashed out on striker Nicky Cross, who would play around 150 games over the next five years. Vale fans were not used to such purchases, but compared to other teams in the division, the money spent was quite modest. Now on a par with rivals Stoke City, both league games ended as draws, though Stoke were relegated in bottom place.
Delighted with his team, he made few changes in preparation for the 1990–91 campaign. Vale once again finished comfortably in mid-table. £80,000 was spent on Dutch midfielder Robin van der Laan, over the next five years he would become a key player. In June 1992, Rudge again broke the club's transfer record, picking up striker Martin Foyle for £375,000 from Oxford United. Foyle would be a dominant figure at the club throughout the 1990s. The money for these acquisitions came from the sale of midfield dynamo Robbie Earle to Wimbledon.
In 1991–92, the club finished in last place, five points short of the safety of Oxford United. The club were still a Second Division club due to the creation of the Premier League, though they were now in the third tier. Ian Taylor became another masterstroke signing, after he was purchased from non-league Moor Green for £15,000 in May 1992. 
Rudge managed his team to Wembley twice in 1993, winning the Football League Trophy final 2–1 over Stockport County, but losing the play-off final 3–0 to West Bromwich Albion. His team had proved however that they were too good to remain in the third tier for long.
In 1993–94 the club went up in second place, also beating top-flight Southampton in the FA Cup. At the end of the season, Ian Taylor was sold to Sheffield Wednesday, becoming the club's first million pound sale.
The club consolidated their First Division status in 1994–95, finishing ten points above the drop. The money from Taylor's sale was reinvested into £225,000 Steve Guppy from Newcastle United and £15,000 striker Tony Naylor from nearby Crewe Alexandra. Both men would prove to be good buys, Naylor being a three time top scorer. At the end of the season, Van der Laan was sold to Derby County for £475,000 plus Lee Mills. £450,000 of this sum was reinvested in York City midfielder Jon McCarthy. £50,000 was also spent on midfielder Ian Bogie.
In 1995–96, his team finished 12th in the First Division. Rudge had Port Vale playing some of the best football ever witnessed at Vale Park. This was mainly due to his perseverance with playing a standard 4–4–2 – employing wingers who became the focal point of much of the attacking play. The club achieved another giant-slaying by vanquishing Everton in the FA Cup. He also led Vale to the final of the Anglo-Italian Cup, where they lost out to Genoa.
In 1996–97, the club finished in eighth place, their best ever post-war finish. Once again they were the best side in the Potteries. In February he sold Guppy to Martin O'Neill's Leicester City for £850,000.
Gareth Ainsworth was purchased for £500,000 from Lincoln City at the start of the 1997–98 season. This was paid for by the sale of McCarthy to Birmingham City for £1.5 million. Vale finished a disappointing 19th, a mere point away from relegation.
At the start of the 1998–99 season, Ainsworth was sold to Wimbledon for £2 million. Mills was also sold to Bradford City for £1 million. The club came even closer to relegation, finishing above 22nd place Bury on goal difference. However Rudge had already departed, Chairman Bill Bell gave him the sack on 18 January 1999. It truly was the end of an era at Vale Park. This caused outrage amongst Port Vale fans who held a "flat cap protest" (Rudge's headwear of choice) to display their disgust.
One last present from Rudge to the Vale fans was the signing of Marcus Bent for £300,000 from Crystal Palace, just days before Rudge's sacking. However new manager Brian Horton let Bent go for £375,000. In November 2000, Bent was sold by Sheffield United to Blackburn Rovers for £2 million. Another star of the late Rudge era was Anthony Gardner. Gardner was retained by Vale, and was sold to Spurs for £1 million in January 2000.
Rudge was awarded £300,000 compensation by an employment tribunal. He had been at the helm for 843 Port Vale games, by sheer coincidence this is one more game than fellow Vale legend Roy Sproson managed as a player.
Following the dismissal, Sir Alex Ferguson said: “Every Port Vale supporter should get down on their knees and thank The Lord for John Rudge.”
Director of Football.
Rudge was appointed as director of football at Stoke City in 1999, after turning down the same role at Port Vale. Rudge had hoped to retire on his own terms at Vale and become a director of football at the club under a "with someone like Robbie Earle as manager". He was offered the management job at Stoke but turned it down. He has never held ambitions of being appointed manager at Stoke, and has been Director of Football under five men: Gary Megson, Guðjón Þórðarson, Steve Cotterill, Johan Boskamp and Tony Pulis.
On 2 November 2005, he had a public fall-out with then manager Johan Boskamp at Highfield Road. Rudge went down the dug-out during the 2–1 win over Coventry City to give some advice to Boskamp. The Dutchman took offence to this and said to the board 'either he goes or I go', under the belief that Rudge had overstepped the mark. Rudge maintains though, that Boskamp used the incident as a ploy, in an attempt to be paid off by Stoke as the Dutchman couldn't handle the pressure of the English game. Rudge points to the evidence that he talked Boskamp out of quitting during the pre-season.
Rudge and his assistant Jan de Koning were twice suspended by Stoke, after disagreements with Boskamp. Following Boskamp's departure and the arrival of new chairman Peter Coates, Rudge was reinstated in his role.
When the club achieved promotion to the Premier League in 2007–08, Rudge was at a top-flight club for the first time since entering the game 46 years ago, in 1962.
Rudge left the Britannia Stadium at the end of the 2012–13 season in a 'major shake-up' of the club's scouting network. He left Stoke in May 2013, ending a 14-year spell at the club.
Managerial style.
Though he got his teams to play good football he was meticulous and rather cautious. He thoroughly researched opposition players and informed his players on weaknesses to exploit and strengths to watch out for. He was reluctant to use substitutions unless a player was injured as he believed in the first eleven he had selected could get the job done over the ninety minutes. He tended not to lose his temper after a bad performance, and instead Robbie Earle said that he had the "ability to make you feel guilty about playing badly".
He had the knack of spotting talented players, signing them cheaply, and then selling them on to bigger clubs for a large profit. In all he made a net income for Port Vale of almost £10 million in the transfer market.

The Burryman

The Burryman or Burry Man is the central figure in an annual ceremony or ritual, the Burryman's Parade, that takes place in South Queensferry, (Gaelic Cas Chaolais) near Edinburgh, on the south bank of the Firth of Forth in Scotland, on the second Friday of August. The custom is associated with, but separate from, the town's Ferry Fair. The meaning of this ceremony has long been forgotten, but it has been the cause of much speculation. It is sometimes said that the custom was first recorded in 1687 (when the right to hold the Ferry Fair was originally granted), but it is widely believed to be much older.
The ceremony.
According to folklorist Christina Hole, writing in 1976, the day of the Burryman ceremony (the second Friday of August) is the day before the town's Ferry Fair. but the present Ferry Fair website suggests that it comes at the end of a week-long fair.
On the Friday morning, a local man is covered from head to ankles in burrs (the sticky flowerheads or seedheads of two species of burdock, "Arctium lappa" and "A. minus") that grow locally. The stickiness of his burry covering means that he has to walk awkwardly, with legs apart and arms held out sideways but he is nevertheless paraded around a seven-mile route through South Queensferry for nine hours or more. He supports his aching arms on waist-high poles decorated with flowers. Two attendants (dressed in normal clothing) guide him through the town and help him through his ordeal. They visit the town's pubs, some factories, and the provost's house, at each of which the Burryman is given a drink of whisky, but because of his sticky facial covering he can only drink through a straw. He is not allowed to speak. By the end of the day he is exhausted.
Tradition holds that he will bring good luck to the town if they give him whisky and money, and that bad luck will result if the custom is discontinued.
Only men born in the village can take on the role of the Burryman. Although local residents must apply annually to the local council for the dubious honour, some have held the office for several years. Alan Reid was the Burryman for 25 years (until 1999); his successor, John Nichol, took over till 2011. Other past holders of the position have included James "Kitter" Magan, Mr. J. Hast, Sam Corson and Arne Fredricksen. From 2012, the position is held by Andrew Taylor.
In 2005, the Burry Man inspired an amusing avantgarde 'folk song' by Daniel Patrick Quinn and narrated by local man Duncan Grahl.
Details of the costume.
The Burryman is meant to collect his covering of burrs for himself, as well as any ferns and flowers used to decorate his costume and the two flower-covered staves (poles) that he rests his hands on. John Nichol admits to recruiting his family to help gather the large number of burrs: approximately 11,000 are needed. They are then meshed together into about 25 flat panels (A3 in size), like natural Velcro, which can be wrapped around his body on the morning of the ceremony. The process takes about half an hour. He dresses in several layers of clothing to protect himself from their hooks. A balaclava covers his head and face; it too is covered with burrs, leaving only small eye and mouth holes; a flower-covered bowler hat tops off the outfit.
He wears boots (his feet are the only parts of his body to remain uncovered by burrs) and has a broad, sash around his waist, currently made from a folded Royal Standard of Scotland, displaying the top half of a red lion rampant on a bright yellow background. The choice of flag used in the outfit has varied, as a photograph from the 1970s shows the sash around the waist made from a folded Union Flag.
Suggested origins.
There are many theories about the origin of the custom, what the ceremony means, and why it continues. One idea is that the parade was intended to ward off evil spirits - it can certainly ward off children, some of whom are terrified at the very sight of the Burryman, and avoid looking him in the eye.
It has been suggested that he carries on a tradition thousands of years old; that he is a symbol of rebirth, regeneration and fertility (similar to the Green Man) that predates almost all contemporary religions; that he is a "scapegoat" and may even originally have been a sacrificial victim.
Similar ceremonies used to be held in other Scottish fishing communities, notably Buckie on the Moray Firth and Fraserburgh, to 'raise the herring' when there had been a poor fishing season. Now, only the South Queensferry ceremony remains in Scotland, though there are possible parallels with the Whittlesea Straw Bear and the Castleton Garland King (and perhaps even the Jack in the green) in England, as well as other customs elsewhere in Europe.

Lý Nam Đế

Lý Nam Đế (chữ Hán:李南帝; October 17, 503 – April 13, 548) is considered by many to be the first emperor of Vietnam and the founder of the Early Lý Dynasty (544–602). His personal name was Lý Bí or Lý Bôn (李賁), and "Nam Đế" was a title meaning "Southern Emperor". He ruled between Feb. 544 – Feb. 548.
Overview.
Lý was of Chinese descent, the ancestors of his family were Chinese who fled Wang Mang's seizure of power during the interregnum between the Western and Eastern Han dynasties. He was a regional magistrate of Giao Châu (交州, Chinese: Jiaozhou), an area of northern Vietnam roughly corresponding to the area of modern Hanoi. In 541, during this time China was under constant civil warfare following the Southern and Northern Dynasties Period, he became increasingly frustrated with the corruption in the government and hostility toward the local population. Upon resignation of his post he gathered the local nobility and tribes within the Red River Valley (North Vietnam) mobilized the imperial troops and naval fleet of Jiaozhou and successfully expelled the Liang administration and led the insurrection that ended in 543. The following year in February 544, Lý Bí was declared "Emperor" by the people with the intention of demonstrating equal in power to China imperial rulers. He renamed the new empire "Vạn Xuân" (萬春, literally "Eternal Spring"). His imperial armies also repelled attacks from Champa in the south who had allied with Han's court at the time. 
Lý Nam Đế established his capital at Long Biên (modern-day Hanoi), surrounded himself with effective leadership in military and administrative scholars. Lý Nam Đế was also strongly supported by famous military commander such as Phạm Tu, Triệu Túc, Tinh Thieu, and Triệu Quang Phục, (son of Triệu Tuc, later known as Triệu Việt Vương). The latter emerged as a hero in Vietnamese history and eventually succeeded Lý Nam Đế as ruler in 548. Lý Nam Đế built many fortresses at strategic locations throughout Vạn Xuân to fend off potential threats from Han in the north and from the Champa Kingdom in the south, he also established the first national university for mandarin scholars, implemented land reforms, and promoted literacy amongst the population. He laid the foundation for many reforms that modelled after the Chinese social structure. 
Stability of Vạn Xuân did not last long and in October 544, the Liang Dynasty retaliated against Vạn Xuân by sending 120,000 imperial troops to re-occupy the region. The Liang emperor sent one of his generals Chen Baxian (Trần Bá Tiên) and granted him sole command of the invading Liang forces. By spring of 545, Chen had marched his army into Vạn Xuân territory and laid siege and devastation to many cities. His initial invasion was stalled by Lý imperial forces for months. However, in the winter of 545, Chen laid a surprised attack on the capital during the monsoon season. Lý Nam Đế's imperial forces were caught off guard and the imperial administration was forced abandoned Long Biên and flee westward into neighboring kingdom of Laos. The Lý imperial forces were becoming weary and exhausted and Lý himself was increasingly ill due to months of being exposed in the wilderness. Lý Nam Đế realized that his illness would not enable him to rally the troops and accomplish a successful resistance against the imperial Chinese forces. In February 548, he relinquished imperial authority and transferred his power to his older brother Lý Thiên Bảo (co-ruler from 548 until his death in 555) and Triệu Quang Phục (r. 548–571), who was his best lieutenant and general. 
By April 548, after suffered from serious diseases for months, Lý Nam Đế died in Laos while fighting the Liang forces when local Laotian tribesmen assassinated him in hope for warding off the invading Liang army. His immediate successor was Triệu Quang Phục (thereafter known as Triệu Việt Vương which means Trieu Viet King). The new king continued the resistance and eventually drove the Chinese colonialism from Vạn Xuân in 550. Although China occupied Vietnam for approximately 1,000 years, Lý Nam Đế successfully established a Việt dynasty that gave Northern Vietnam approximately 60 years of independence in between those times.

His father Thomas Person also a saxophonist started him off with the basics of the instrument, and concept of improvisation. He later sent his son to study privately at different music stores. Eric picked up the saxophone quickly, but it wasn't until his family moved from the city of St. Louis, to the county of Normandy, and he enrolled in Thomas Jefferson Elementary School that a passion for performing and studying music caught fire in him. After he entered Normandy Jr High School he started getting into more and more ensembles in and out of school. While at Normandy Jr high he was in the jazz band, concert band, and competed in his first classical competition where he was given a perfect score. Outside of school he would be in two R&B bands The Black Warriors Express and The Soulful Young Band. Both bands would perform local gigs, and some regional touring. In 1977, Eric entered Normandy High School. It was the beginning of an exciting period of discovery for Eric. Normandy High School had one of the top music programs in the state of Missouri and Eric tried to take part in as many bands as he could. He would join the marching band, concert bands, and one of the three jazz bands. He would later become part of the top jazz band, The Norsemen. While still in high school, he would attend the St. Louis Conservatory of Music, and a Saturday afternoon jazz theory class at Washington University. In 1978, While the jazz band was winning many awards at high school jazz competitions throughout Missouri, Eric won a best soloist award, which included a scholarship to attend a Jamey Abersold jazz camp that Summer. There he studied under pianist James Williams and heard many top shelf New York City jazz musicians such as Dave Liebman, Jim McNeely and Adam Nussbaum. There he also met St.louis pianist James "Ironhead" Matthews, he would join his jazz quartet for the next four years playing clubs around St.louis such as The Barbary Coast, The Place of Pleasure and Mr. B's in East St. Louis. Eric was living and learning jazz, playing with professionals, getting paid and this was wetting his appetite for more challenges. Around this time he composed his first jazz compositions. He found he had a love for composition and set about composing with the goal of expressing his personal ideas through song. His composition, Magenta which he wrote at age 18, is a personal favorite which he recorded on his Live at Big Sur CD, which was released in 2002. By the time Eric graduated high school in 1980 he was restless. He was hearing the call of greener pastures. He was reading about his idols in the Jazz Spotlight News that he subscribed to. It showed what was happening on the New York City jazz scene. So that Summer he took a trip to New York City with James "Ironhead" Matthews, a trip that would change his life. He knew the "Big Apple" was the place to be. He came back to St. Louis with the goal of coming back to New York in three months. His father, who was all for his adventure, suggested that he stay home one year to save up some money, and "tie up some loose ends." It was wise advise which he heeded. In that year he studied with woodwind teacher Lloyd Smith, and took theory and piano classes at Florrisant Valley Community college while finishing up his stint with the James "Ironhead" Matthews quartet.
1982-92 New York City.
Eric arrived in New York City on May 17, 1982. He played his first New York City gigs with the John Hicks Big Band at the Public Theater. Drummer Ronnie Burrage took him to Washington D.C to play a gig that included a young Wynton Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland and Avery Sharpe. Person also formed an early quartet that included guitarist Cary Denigris, bassist Kevin Bruce Harris and drummer Ronnie Burrage. That group rehearsed once a month at the now defunct Air Studios, and performed two explosive performances in St. Louis and at a club called Eric's in New York city. As the months rolled on into 1983, during the Spring and Summer months Eric spent his days practicing his horn outside on Riverside Drive. He either practiced there or in the back of a numbers joint on West 145th street, because the owner of the rooming house where he lived at would not allow him to play his horn there. During the week he went to sit-in at an old jazz club called The Blue Book. In that same year he auditioned for drummer Chico Hamilton. He would perform with Mr. Hamilton off and on throughout the 80's and 90's, touring and recording six CD releases with him.
In 1984 he joined Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society. This gave Person his first extensive European touring and recording opportunities. He would play with Shannon till 1987, and record six recordings with him.
1993-98 New Horizons.
Throughout the 90's Eric continued to be featured with some high power groups. In 1993 he joined the World Saxophone Quartet. Person immediately went into the studio and contributed to the CD the band was finishing, Moving Right Along on Black Saint. He contributed two songs to that recording, "Antithesis" and "Sharrod." His first tour with the band was a California tour that featured three African drummers. From 1994 to 1997 Person was a member of the Dave Holland Quartet, which toured Europe, the United States and Canada. The band's success culminated in their recording of Dream Of The Elders on ECM. Also During this time Eric released his first three CD releases on Soul Note Records. Arrival, Prophecy and More Tales to Tell all garnered favorable reviews. About "Arrival" and "Prophecy" Down Beat wrote:
3.5 Stars - Person swerving toward the left, finding a fresh path between mainstream jazz and chancier, more personalized terrain...In addition to his bold playing, Person has some fine compositional ideas...
4 Stars - (Prophecy) shows his bold alto and soprano to be as in touch with complex gradations of joy as...with precise shadings of melancholy. Self-probing compositions and his examinations of time-honored music are utterly fascinating...
Person recorded with soul rock singer/guitarist Ben Harper, on his CD The Will to Live. The CD peaked at number 89 on the Billboard 200. It also went gold in France. Person also arranged a three piece horn section that performed throughout California, in New York City, Paris and London. The performance at Royal Albert Hall was videotaped and released Pleasure+Pain. It features the horns on three Ben Harper classics, and with Eric performing a burning saxophone solo on the final song.
1999-present.
After his first CD releases on Soul Note Records, Eric decided to form his own label Distinction Records to control and produce all levels of his product. The labels first release, Extra Pressure was released in 1999 and featured the first version of his jazz group Meta-Four. The band included pianist John Esposito, bassist Carlos Henderson and drummer E.J.Strickland. The band toured in the USA and Canada. In 2002 Person released Live at Big Sur with a new version of Meta-Four which featured pianist John Esposito, bassist Kenny Davis and drummer Peter O'Brien. This band played the 2002 Guimarães Jazz Festival in Portugal.
In 2005 Person released his sixth CD Reflections as a collective statement that summed up his favorite compositions and performances from his first five releases. Three dynamic performances from the 1998 Texaco Jazz Festival featuring trumpeter Dave Douglas were added. After extensive touring in 2005 and 2006, Eric kicked off a four week United States tour with his seventh CD Release Rhythm Edge. This CD would feature his then current Meta-Four band and special guests Robin Eubanks, Ingrid Jensen, Cary Denigris and Daniel Sadownick. Since 1994 his band Meta-Four has been featured in clubs, concerts, masterclasses and festivals across the USA, Canada and Europe.
In 2008 Person premiered a new band, Metamorphosis which unlike his four piece jazz group Meta-Four delves into funk, rock, groove and electric soundscapes.
In 2010 Person released his eighth CD release, The Grand Illusion. He calls this his "rhythm and groove" project. This CD features guitarist Cary Denigris, keyboardist Zaccai Curtis, and the late bassist Robert "Bob" Bowen. Critic Donald Elfman states: "Saxophonist Eric Person seems to find something new to say and a different direction to follow with every project he undertakes...the music seems daring at this time, recalling the jazz/funk experiments of the past, and the commitment of the players makes it work"
Person's 2012 release Thoughts on God is his first CD to feature music performed by a large ensemble. This ensemble of thirteen musicians perform a suite of twelve compositions written to glorify the creator.
Glenn Astarita of All About Jazz.com says: "Revered saxophonist Eric Person parlays God's message via the jazz vernacular, his spiritual ascension and unbridled fortitude equating to one of the finest modern jazz outings of 2012...branded by his personalization of the jazz idiom, teeming with impressive compositions and inspiring arrangements."
Michael McDowell of Blitz Magazine says, "He (Person) has definitely joined Coltrane in having produced an enduring work that will stand as a hallmark of the genre."
Amy Duncan of Jazz History online.com says, "Thoughts on God is an exciting and satisfying presentation from an inspiring and original new voice in large jazz ensemble writing."
Scott Albin of Jazztimes says, "Person's fifth release on his Distinction Records label, and his first orchestral work, this is probably his greatest achievement to date..."
Collaborations.
In 1987 Person formed "Sources" a duo with tabla/sirod/acoustic guitar performer Bob Coke. The music blended elements of avant gard jazz, open Indian grooves, and innovative soundscapes. The group toured Western France, Eastern USA, and New York City clubs and galleries. In 1990 Person was featured soloist with the New York City Symphony for a performance of Duke Ellington`s Three Black Kings at the Apollo Theatre in New York City. It was the first time a full symphony orchestra had performed at the world famous New York City venue.
Person has also performed with (piano) Michiel Borstlap, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Michelle Rosewoman, (drums) Joe Chambers, Franklin Kiermyer, Michael Carvin, (vocalists) Jimmy Scott, Ofra Haza, and Jennifer Holiday, (Belgium percussionist) Chris Joris, guitarist Kelvyn Bell and Bassist/funkmaster Bootsy Collins. Person is also on unreleased tracks featuring rapper Chuck D. An April 2009 concert in Rochester New York titled "Person to Person" brought together two generations of saxophonists: Eric Person and Houston Person. The wildly enthusiastic crowd guaranteed there would be more performances in the future from this collaboration. Person also debuted another project with 2008 Down Beat critics poll elected vocalist Dwight Trible. The two were backed by Person's band, Meta-Four West in a performance at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and at the Santa Monica Community College.
In the Fall of 2010 a collective with bassist Joe Lepore and drummer Shinnosuke Takahashi was formed from a series of jam sessions at the bassists home. The group was named TrioKinesis recorded and released their debut CD TrioKinesis in 2012.

Chionis of Sparta

Chionis of Sparta (; Greek "Χιόνις") was an athlete of ancient Greece who was most notable for his jumping records in the ancient Olympic Games. Records suggest that in the 656 BC Olympics Chionis jumped a then record of 7 meters and 5 centimetres. If accurate, such a record would have won Chionis the inaugural Olympic title of the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and placed him among the top eight at a further ten Olympics, up to and including the 1952 Games of Helsinki.
As well as his amazing achievements in long jump, Chionis was also noted as a triple jumper capable of reaching up to . Although the rules of such jumps are unclear, such a distance under modern rules would have won Chionis the modern Olympic title right up to the 1952 games in Helsinki.
Chionis was also credited with winning three consecutive titles in the "diaulos" and "stade" between 664, 660, and 656 BC. The "diaulos" was an event that involved a race of two laps around the track, or about . The "stade" was the signature contest of the 476 BC Olympics that involved a sprinting race that was run the length of a straight track, perhaps similar to the modern 100 m sprint. 
Chionis' record was not matched until the 480 BC Olympics where a man called Astylos (representing Syracuse, Sicily) achieved the same feat, but also demonstrated his versatility by winning the "hoplitodromos", which was a race completed in an armoured suit. Defending the honour of Chionis, the Spartans amended the inscription on his memorial stele in Olympia, pointing out that there was no "hoplitodromos" event in his time.

Roy Sproson

Roy Sproson (23 September 1930 – 24 January 1997) was an English footballer and football manager for Port Vale. A one-club man, he holds the all-time appearance record for Vale, making 837 starts (and 5 substitute appearances) for Vale between 1950 and 1972. This includes a run of 128 consecutive appearances between April 1954 and March 1957. He is also fourteenth on the all time Football League appearance list.
Sproson is a Port Vale legend, sticking with the club from its highest peaks in the early 1950s until the troughs of the last 1960s near the bottom of the Football League. He served under eight managers before taking the reins himself between 1974 and 1977. A relic of a bygone era when it was common for players to only play for a few clubs throughout their entire careers, his record for the club is unlikely ever to be equalled or bettered. He finished with around 350 more appearances for the club than his closest rival, and teammate of fifteen years, Harry Poole.
Playing career.
Roy Sproson was born above a greengrocer's shop at 3 Slater Street, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent on 23 September 1930. Legend has it he was named for the local featherweight boxer Roy Berrisford, after his father returned home from witnessing a Berrisford victory to find his wife had given birth in his absence. The family later moved to Trent Vale, where a young Sproson played football for the Trent Vale Lifeboys, winning the Sentinel Shield with a 5–0 win over Port Vale.
Sproson played for Stoke City at an amateur level for twelve months in the late 1940s. He was courted by teams such as Aston Villa, West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers. His father wished him to follow in his footsteps and sign for Stoke City. The Stoke manager Bob McGrory promised him a contract after Sproson finished his National service, but after brother Jess introduced him to Port Vale manager Gordon Hodgson, he signed with the Vale for £3 a week while he served his National service. In July 1949 Sproson's time with the Royal Air Force had finished and he signed with Port Vale as a professional. However he had to wait until 11 November 1950 for his debut, in a 1–1 draw with Gillingham at Priestfield. He started the last five games of the season after sharing the No. 6 jersey with Jimmy Todd and Bill McGarry.
Hodgson's death in June 1951 did not keep Sproson out of the first eleven and he played most games under new manager Ivor Powell. His first goal came on 22 September in a 2–2 draw at home with Torquay United. However following the appointement of Freddie Steele in December 1951, Sproson was dropped in favour of the experienced Stan Palk. Sproson won his place back in March 1952 and held on to his shirt for many years. Steele worked to develop the famous 'Iron Curtain' defence, as the Vale defence conceded just 35 times in 46 games in 1952–53. Only Second Division Huddersfield Town conceded fewer, though Vale still finished one point behind Oldham Athletic.
The 1953–54 season would live on Vale folk-lore. Sproson was one of the men that made it happen, playing in 53 games. The club stormed to the Third Division North championship with just 21 goals conceded in 46 games (a Football League record). Sproson helped keeper Ray King keep thirty clean sheets in the league (again a record). He also played Vale's FA Cup semi-final defeat to West Bromwich Albion.
He had little trouble adapting to life in the Second Division the following season. He made 45 appearances in 1954–55 and 44 appearances in 1955–56. However in 1956–57 the club struggled and suffered relegation – the 'Iron Curtain' was a thing of the past as they leaked 101 goals in the league.
In 1957–58 the club found themselves in the last ever season of the Third Division South. Norman Low couldn't bring his team to a top twelve finish, which meant the club spent 1958–59 in the new Fourth Division. Low adopted an attacking policy, but still relied on men like Sproson to hold the fort at the back. They took the Fourth Division title in 1958–59, though Sproson spent the first half of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Terry Miles took his No. 6 jersey, though both Alan Martin and Roy Pritchard failed to hold on to the No. 3 jersey, which Sproson claimed in February 1959. It was the first time in six season he played less than forty games, for the next eleven seasons he would make at least thirty games a season.
He played 49 games in 1959–60. Sproson was back. In 1960–61 he hit 51 games. In 1961–62, 1962–63 and 1963–64 he was a regular custodian in the back four, as the club tried and failed to win promotion. In 1964–65 the veteran couldn't prevent the club from slipping back into the fourth tier, as Freddie Steele's second time in charge proved much less successful than the first. Under Jackie Mudie and then Stanley Matthews the club struggled. Sproson was as much in demand as ever, in 1965–66, 1966–67, 1967–68 and again in 1968–69 the club frittered about at the foot of the league. He was made the inaugural winner of the Port Vale F.C. Player of the Year award in 1967.
When new manager Gordon Lee finally pushed the team to promotion in 1969–70, forty-year-old Sproson was four years his manager's senior. Despite this he managed to post 52 appearances in the campaign. Lee had to regularly talk him out of retirement. With promotion secured, Sproson was allowed to drift out of the first team picture. Named Gillette Sportsman of the Year in April 1970, he made seven appearances in 1970–71. His final appearance came on 8 May 1972 in a 2–1 defeat to Rotherham United at Vale Park. It was his only League match of the season, and he continued at the club in a coaching capacity.
Sproson finished with a grand total 837 starts and five substitute appearances, being yellow carded just twice in his professional career. Many supporters believed if he had not remained so intensely loyal to Vale then he would certainly have played in the First Division, and possibly even received international honours.
Management career.
After manager Gordon Lee left to join Blackburn Rovers in January 1974 he advised Vale's chairman Mark Singer to appoint Sproson as his successor. Singer took this advice and appointed him caretaker-manager, before handing him the job on a permanent basis in April of the same year. At the end of 1973–74 Vale finished twentieth, one place but seven points above the drop. His insisted that the players not call him 'boss' and in the spirit of Norman Low his footballing philosophy was to go out and 'entertain the public'.
For the 1974–75 season he signed midfielders Terry Bailey and Frank Sharp, defender Garry Dulson, and goalkeeper John Connaughton. The club finished in sixth place, just four points short of promotion. However due to the club's precarious financial situation a total of thirteen players were released. He made ambition plans for the 1975–76 season, though he failed to land Wales internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies. Instead he signed striker Mick Cullerton from Stafford Rangers for £4,000, and midfielders Terry Lees (a £3,000 signing from Stoke City) and Geoff Morris (a £200 signing from Bangor City). Cullerton hit 21 goals, but Vale could not repeat their efforts of the previous season and had to make do with a twelfth place finish.
For the 1976–77 season he was forced to sell Terry Lees to Sparta Rotterdam for £25,000 (representing a £22,000 profit in the space of twelve months). He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a £12,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline – Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Mid-way through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for £15,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of £8,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for £30,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy. Nevertheless relegation was narrowly avoided at the end of 1976–77, as his side finished nineteenth, three points above the drop.
There was unrest at Port Vale at the start of 1977–78, as Sammy Morgan and David Harris were so upset by the low wages they were offered that they refused to play for the club. Sproson brought in three players on free transfers: Jeff Hemmerman, Grahame McGifford, and Bill Bentley. However at a meeting on 28 June, Sproson was severely criticized for his supposed poor judgement of players and for seeming to place greater priority on his newsagent business than the club. "The Sentinel" reported that "there is disenchantment in the air", and there were rumours that former Stoke manager Tony Waddington would be brought in to replace Sproson. Sproson was sacked in October 1977 after a poor run of results. His replacement Bobby Smith failed to rescue Vale from relegation despite making numerous signings. England manager Don Revie had predicted such a fate when he said at a dinner that "English football suffers from the same complaint all the time. You've got two local lads here as your management team to Sproson and his assistant Reg Berks. I'll tell you now, you won't give them enough money to get out of this division, but eventually you'll give them both the sack and then you'll give the next manager the lot."
Sproson refused the club's offer of "an executive position dealing with the club's youth policy". Taking his name plate off his office door "to spare anyone else the bother", it was clear his sacking had upset him greatly. Leaving under a cloud, he refused to return to the club whilst those that had sacked him remained in the boardroom. The next month he promised to help the club "in any capacity", though never returned to Vale Park again.
Post-retirement.
Sproson ran a Newsagent's shop until he died on 24 January 1997, aged 66.
Legacy.
The Sproson name figures prominently in Port Vale's history. Roy's older brother, Jess, played as a forward for Vale between 1940 and 1947, and his nephew, Phil (Jess's son), was a central defender between 1978 and 1989. Another brother, Clifford, had played at amateur level for Vale in the Cheshire County League. His father played professionally for Stoke during World War I.
Port Vale's away kit for the 2005–06 season (in the club's old amber and black colours) bore the motto '837 – One Man One Team', embroidered on the left sleeve to honour his memory. A street by Vale Park has been renamed 'Roy Sproson Way' in his memory. In March 2011, he was inducted into the City of Stoke-on-Trent Hall of Fame, along with Gordon Banks. After ten years of planning, a £96,000 statue of Sproson was unveiled on 17 November 2012, before a home game with York City.

Captain Bogg and Salty

Captain Bogg and Salty is a pirate-themed rock band from Portland, Oregon, and a representative member of the subgenre of pirate rock. The band is well known for their live shows, performed in full pirate regalia. The band members each portray crew members of the pirate ship "Pollywogg", ranging from the ship's captain, Angus Bogg, to the lowly deck-hand Salty. 
The band has enjoyed success in the Pacific Northwest as both children's entertainers, and as a band enjoyed by adults—having performed numerous sold-out appearances in both children's venues (such as libraries) and adult venues (such as nightclubs). Unusually; they perform the same material in both types of venue; they have been quite adept at crossing the generation gap.
History.
The band was formed in 1999 by Kevin Hendrickson, a musician involved with several other pirate-themed bands, most notably Pirate Jenny, and Loren Hoskins, a voice actor and comedian from the Portland area. The duo produced the band's first album, "Bedtime Stories for Pirates" as a concept album. The album was well-received, and is found in many pirate-themed attractions, including the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. As demand grew, four additional musicians joined the band, including fellow Pirate Jenny alumnus Paul Iannotti, and local stage actor Andy Lindberg, who as a teenager garnered some measure of infamy for his portrayal of "Lardass" Hogan in the 1985 Rob Reiner film "Stand By Me". The band has released three additional albums: "Pegleg Tango" (2005), "Prelude to Mutiny" (2006), and "Emphatical Piratical" (2009). "Pegleg Tango" was enthusiastically reviewed by Entertainment Weekly magazine.
The band also played several shows in the New York City area in October 2006, culminating in an appearance opening for Harvey Danger at the famed Maxwell's nightclub in Hoboken, New Jersey. In September 2007, Lindberg went on to pursue an acting career in New York.
Hendrickson and Hoskins also write the music for and perform in the Disney Junior show "Jake and the Never Land Pirates".

Flor de Caña

Flor de Caña (Spanish for "sugarcane flower") is a brand of rum distributed by Compañía Licorera de Nicaragua which is headquartered in Managua, Nicaragua.
History.
"Flor de Caña" is made by Compañía Licorera de Nicaragua, S.A, (CLNSA) a member of Grupo Pellas. Compañía Licorera de Nicaragua was founded in 1937. Initially the company sought to develop a large sugarcane plantation so they built their first distillery in Chichigalpa (about 120 km from Managua) in 1890.
After building the distillery, it was not until 1937 that Flor De Caña was introduced by CLNSA. Grupo Pellas was founded in 1950. It was the first company to distribute the rum, and in 1959 it was first exported to Venezuela, Costa Rica and other Central American countries.
During 1963 and 1965 the plantation in Chichigalpa underwent modernization updates. 8 years later a second distillery was constructed in Honduras. The Plantation in Chichigalpa was completely modernized in 1996.
In 1980, The Contras utilized funds from the Honduran distillery to form and fund "Death Squads".
On November 9, 2007, the Compañía Licorera de Nicaragua, which produces Flor de Caña, launched a new rum called "Zeta". Zeta combines 4 year old rums with citrus. The rum is targeted toward young adults 18 and over.
Recognition.
Flor De Caña is renowned as one of the best rums in Latin America, having won more than 100 international awards since 2000 and has been the most award-winning rum brand during this period. It has captured gold, silver, and bronze medals and has received high recommendations from wine and liquor enthusiasts.
Pepper Patch, a Tennessee-based specialty foods firm, regards Flor De Caña as the "perfect rum" and has added a rum cake to their product list made with the award winning 12-year-old Centenario rum.
Brand symbol.
A distinctive aspect of Flor de Caña is its brand symbol present on all bottles. The logo depicts a road, with palm trees on the sides, that continues on to the horizon. A chain of volcanoes is also seen on the horizon. The symbol was inspired by the railroad, along with the palm trees on the sides, that led to the San Antonio sugar mill located in Chichigalpa, Nicaragua, where the Flor de Caña rum was first produced, and where it continues to be produced today. The volcano in the center seen on the horizon is the San Cristobal volcano, the tallest in Nicaragua.
Product.
Flor de Caña produces both white and dark rums.

Battle of Boydton Plank Road

The Battle of the Boydton Plank Road (also known as Burgess Mill or First Hatcher's Run), fought on October 27–28, 1864, followed the successful Battle of Peebles' Farm in the Siege of Petersburg during the American Civil War. It was an attempt by the Union Army to seize the Boydton Plank Road and cut the South Side Railroad, a critical supply line to Petersburg, Virginia.
Background.
At the Battle of Peebles' Farm earlier in October, the Union V Corps had seized a portion of the Confederate works around Hatcher's Run. The entire II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, was pulled out of the trenches and moved to operate against the Confederates' Boydton Line in conjunction with a simultaneous operation against the Richmond defenses along the Darbytown Road. The II Corps was reinforced by divisions from the V Corps, IX Corps, and Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's cavalry division already operating in the area.
Battle.
On October 27, Hancock marched across Hatcher's Run, brushed aside Confederate pickets and moved around the Confederate flank towards Burgess Mill. The division under Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott crossed the Boydton Plank Road and attacked Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton's Confederate cavalry threatening to cut it off from the main Confederate lines. Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill, who commanded the Confederate defenses in the area, reacted quickly to Hancock's threat. However, once his units moved to confront the Federals, Hill, in poor health, proved too sick to continue field command and turned over direction of his corps to Maj. Gen. Henry Heth. Heth put two divisions in Hancock's path, but the Federal commander drove up the Boydton Plank Road and pushed aside the opposing Confederates. At this time both Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant rode out to the battlefield, where Meade immediately noticed a gap between Hancock and the V Corps. With the South Side Railroad still away, Meade realized that continuing the advance would only further isolate the II Corps, and so ordered Hancock to halt. Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford's V Corps division was ordered to link with the II Corps but became caught up in the dense woods. General Grant, meanwhile, made a personal reconnaissance of the Confederate works and, after coming under fire, determined that the Confederates were too strong and called off the offensive. 
Having never linked up with Crawford's division, Hancock's corps returned to Hatcher's Run crossing but found it blocked by Confederate cavalry. This left the entire II Corps isolated on the north side of Hatcher's Run without support. With the memory of Reams's Station infusing them, Heth and Hampton saw a golden opportunity to destroy the whole II Corps. Hancock's only line of retreat was the Dabney Mill Road, for which Heth was now aiming. Late in the afternoon, Brig. Gen. William Mahone's division attacked through the same woods that had stopped Crawford and seized the Dabney Mill Road, while a Confederate cavalry division under Maj. Gen. W.H.F. "Rooney" Lee moved up behind the Federals. Mahone moved so far around the Federal flank that Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Egan's II Corps division was forced to completely change fronts. Hancock was now surrounded on 3 sides with no line of retreat. But unlike at Reams's Station, the II Corps did not panic, and Hancock seized the initiative. Mahone had almost been too successful and found his division isolated in turn. Hancock ordered an attack on both Confederate flanks. Hampton failed to hold off the Union cavalry and Gregg was able to move up and aid in routing Mahone. The tables had thus turned and the Confederates, now threatened with encirclement, retreated up the Boydton Plank Road. Hancock retained his hold on the Boydton Plank Road and Grant left to him the decision whether to remain or withdraw to the initial Union lines. Although Hancock had repulsed the Confederate attack, his position was still very unstable. That night Hancock marched his men back to their original position.
Aftermath.
With October nearly over, both armies settled into winter quarters. The Confederates maintained their hold on the Boydton Plank Road throughout the winter. Hancock had won a tactical victory over Heth's Confederates, partially erasing the stain of the rout at Reams's Station. No further significant action occurred on any front around Petersburg for the rest of the year.
The Battle of the Boydton Plank Road marked the last battle of two distinguished Union generals in the Army of the Potomac. The following month, Winfield Hancock resigned from field command due to complications with the wound he received at Gettysburg. Then in January 1865, David McM. Gregg unexpectedly resigned his command. His letter of resignation alluded to an anxiety of being away from his home. Meade's chief-of-staff, Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys, assumed command of the II Corps and would resume the offensive against the Boydton Plank Road in February of the following year.

Spock's World

"Spock's World" is a 1989 novel by Diane Duane, set in the fictional Star Trek universe. The plot revolves around a movement on the planet Vulcan to secede from the United Federation of Planets. The book alternates chapters that advance the main plotline with chapters that relate important scenes from Vulcan's history, and much of the book explores underlying themes in Vulcan philosophy and culture, especially the idea of "cthia", a Vulcan philosophical (and possibly religious, depending on interpretation) concept translated in the book as "reality-truth — seeing things the way they really are, instead of the way we would like to see them".
Plot synopsis.
Certain Vulcan organizations, many with anti-human biases, have begun a movement calling for the secession of Vulcan from the United Federation of Planets, citing the emotionality and unpredictability of humans as dangerous factors for the further development of the planet Vulcan. The dispute is to be resolved by a planetwide vote, with televised debates by important figures for a certain time period beforehand. James T. Kirk and the rest of the crew of the "Enterprise" are called away from shore leave on Earth in order to serve as diplomats for Vulcan, arguing against the secession, as the odds that Vulcan will leave the Federation are considered very high. Spock, being half-human and half-Vulcan as well as a prominent Starfleet officer, is seen as one of the most important figures in the debate.
While on Vulcan, the crew discovers (mostly through detective work by Dr. Leonard McCoy, using the aid of a sentient computer named "Moira" resident on the Enterprise) that the secession movement was sparked at least partially by T'Pring, Spock's childhood bride-mate, who has nursed a grudge against Kirk and Spock for years for the deception involved in their participation in the koon-ut-kalifee ceremony (see the original series episode "Amok Time" for a description of these events). Using the financial resources and connections available to her after the death of Stonn, T'Pring funded many of the organizations seeking to spark anti-human prejudice in the larger Vulcan population, as well as arranging favorable contracts for them regarding Federation property that would revert to the care of the Vulcan government should the secession take place. 
Kirk, Spock, and McCoy consult heavily with Sarek, Spock's father and head ambassador from Vulcan to the Federation, and Amanda Grayson, his mother, regarding how to inform the Vulcan population of the corruption, but are interrupted by the news that T'Pau, a Vulcan elder and possibly the most respected living figure on Vulcan at that point, is dying. T'Pau makes the decision to transfer her katra (in a sense, her soul) to Amanda, instead of another Vulcan, proving her trust in certain members of the human race, and tells Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sarek, and Amanda that since T'Pring's plot was able to thrive in secrecy and subterfuge, it should be countered with openness and honesty, and that the information should simply be given to the Vulcan population. The news of the corruption throws the planet into turmoil, but the news of her death and cross-species katra transfer brings it to a muted standstill. By this point, Kirk and McCoy (who were, with Spock, invited to participate in the debates as Starfleet representatives), have already given their arguments against secession. Spock's argument concludes the debates, and the planet votes on the secession, which is decided by a large margin in favor of remaining in the Federation.
Points of note.
Only half the book is devoted to the main plotline dealing with Spock, Kirk, McCoy, Sarek, Amanda, and T'Pring, with the remaining chapters retelling important scenes from the history of Vulcan. The "Vulcan chapters" chronicle the evolution of the Vulcan species from gentle forest-dwellers on a paradisical planet through the solar flare that decimated it and turned it into the desert it is known as in Star Trek continuity, to an incredibly warlike species slowly developing psychic powers through genetics and social breeding programs, through the development of space age technology, to with the teaching and adoption of "cthia" (loosely translated as "reality-truth") by Surak as a unifying philosophy that ends millennia of war by the Vulcan race. These chapters conclude with the initial meeting of Sarek and Amanda Grayson and their decision to bear and raise Spock.
The book is also notable for an understanding of actual scientific principles that many of the future technologies described in the book would have to implement, such as principles of linguistics, particle physics, and artificial intelligence. While obviously required to diverge somewhat from modern science by the necessities of remaining true to Star Trek continuity, possible and somewhat plausible details of implementation are given for a number of important technologies. The word "cthia" itself is not translated by the universal translation devices used by Kirk (who does not speak Vulcan), reflecting an understanding of difficulty in accurately translating complex cultural concepts between languages (almost always encountered in actual linguistics). McCoy, however, has taken a biochemical language-learning aid to assist his understanding of Vulcan, which is described as a "RNA messenger sequence" and works by biochemically adding cells to his brain that provide an understanding of Vulcan; RNA (or ribonucleic acid) is a main carrier of genetic information regarding protein synthesis in actual biology. "Moira" is the name of a computer on the Enterprise in the book that has been given artificial intelligence and a female personality and who uses "her" innate understanding of computers to retrieve information for Dr. McCoy, and is also presented in a way consistent with modern A.I. science at the time of the book's writing. Also notably, "she" argues against a fundamental difference between human intelligence and her own, using the phrase "protein chauvinist" to describe humans who believe their intelligence to be intrinsically superior to that of a computer with similar cognitive abilities.
Continuity.
The book, which says that Surak was killed by terrorists, is contradicted by later televised "Star Trek". ' establishes that Surak instead had been killed by radiation poisoning, although one might consider the radiation exposure to be due to the act of terrorists. The book also alludes to the prior novel "Strangers from the Sky" in describing first contact between Humans and Vulcans, both of which were superseded by the film '.
Influence.
The novel spent eight weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List in 1988. 
The novel is a favorite of the 2009 film's co-writer Roberto Orci.

Bogdanovka

Bogdanovka was a concentration camp for Jews that was established by the Romanian authorities during World War II as part of the Holocaust, during the 1941 Odessa massacre which saw the extermination of Jews in Odessa and surrounding towns in Transnistria during the autumn of 1941 and the winter of 1942 in a series of massacres and killings during the Holocaust by Romanian forces, under German control, encouragement and instruction.
Location.
Three concentration camps were situated near the villages of Bogdanovka, Domanovka and Acmecetca on the Southern Bug river, in Golta district, Transnistria with Bogdanoka holding 54,000 people by the end of 1941.
Massacres.
In December 1941, a few cases of typhus which is a disease spread by lice and fleas broke out in the camp. A decision was made by the German adviser to the Romanian administration of the district and the Romanian District Commissioner to murder all the inmates. The "Aktion" began on December 21, and was carried out by Romanian soldiers and gendarmes, Ukrainian police and civilians from Golta, and local ethnic Germans under the commander of the Ukrainian regular police, Kazachievici. Thousands of disabled and ill inmates were forced into two locked stables, which were doused with kerosene and set ablaze, burning alive all those inside. Other inmates were led in groups to a ravine in a nearby forest and shot in the neck. The remaining Jews dug pits with their bare hands in the bitter cold, and packed them with frozen corpses.

Equipment trust certificate

An equipment trust certificate (ETC) is a financial security used in aircraft finance, most commonly to take advantage of tax benefits in North America.
In a typical ETC transaction, a "trust certificate" is sold to investors in order to finance the purchase of an aircraft by a trust managed on the investors' behalf. The trust then leases the aircraft to an airline, and the trustee routes payments through the trust to the investors. Upon maturity of the note, the airline receives title to the aircraft.
The lease is not a "true" lease because the airline receives title at the end. Therefore, ETCs are a form of secured debt financing similar to a mortgage. Because the aircraft is not owned by the airline until maturity, the aircraft is not considered airline property for the purposes of bankruptcy; however, alternative forms of financing such as mortgage and securitization lead to the same result, making this a relatively minor advantage in comparison to the tax benefits.
An enhanced ETC, also known as a double ETC, is similar to a conventional ETC except that the security has been divided into two or more classes of securities, each with different payment priorities and asset claims. The more senior certificates (those with highest priority) have a higher credit rating and may obtain an investment grade rating for the particular issue. EETCs issues are similar to securitization transactions in that ownership remains with a separate trust rather than the operator, which has different tax implications.

Naimatullah Khan

Naimatullah Khan (نعمت اللہ خان) was the Mayor of Karachi from August 2001 to June 2005. Naimatullah Khan has been involved with Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, and is a senior member of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. 
Early life.
Naimatullah Khan was born in Ajmer, Rajasthan, British India on 1 October 1930 to Abdul Shakoor Khan,a railway postmaster and Bismillah Begum, a housewife. He was the third child of Abdul Shakoor Khan. He had two elder sisters and two younger brothers. In 1940, his father died of tuberculosis. The family then moved to Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, British India to live with their maternal relatives.
Migration.
Conditions detoriated in the Indian Subcontinent in 1940s as the partition neared. In the meantime, Khan's family moved back to Ajmer and Khan was now living with his paternal uncles. Khan briefly volunteered as a national guard for the Pakistan Muslim League rallies where he caught glimpses of national leaders like Qaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaqat Ali Khan. It was July 1947 and Khan's departure to newly created Pakistan was eminent. One day during clashes with the Hindus Khan and his friends made fire crackers filled in packs of cigerrates and threw them at the opposition. Police was in search of Khan and his friends and his Taaya(uncle) advised him to leave Ajmer for Karachi. Khan obeyed the orders and thus commenced the journey which would change his and his family's life. He left Ajmer alone for Karachi sometime in July 1947. He took a train which took him directly to Karachi via the Rajhastan desert. The train line currently stands suspended. He had a stop at Hyderabad,Pakistan where he met his father's friend who gave him 10 rupees. Khan's train was one of the very last trains which completed their journey without any manslaughter. Naimatullah Khan spent his first night on a footpath on I.I.Chundrigar road in a place where currently the Cotton Exchange of Pakistan stands.
Early years of struggle 1947–58.
Khan describes his life from 1947–1958 as that of struggle and hardships. A few days after coming to Karachi, Khan was given a small flat on Burns Road to live under the migrant claims system prevailing at that time. That lot of flats were occupied mostly by Hindus who immediately protested to a Muslim living in the flats and Khan was turned out by the authorities. Thus Khan had no option but to set up a Jhonprri (straw house) near a place where later the tomb of Qaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was built. Khan started doing part-time jobs mostly that of a stenographer. He had learned shorthand back at Ajmer which helped him. In the meantime he went back to Ajmer and brought his younger brother with him to Karachi. Up until this point Khan was totally uninterested in studies. His mood changed while he was preparing for the exam of the prestigious Indian Civil Service. Although he didn't qualify, this preparation inclined him towards pursuing higher studies. He had already done his matriculation back at Ajmer. Khan brought his other family members to Karachi in 1949–50 and they settled with him in the Jhonprri. Both his sisters were married from this Jhonprri. In the meantime Khan concentrated on his work and studies. He worked all day from six in the morning to ten at night doing several part-time jobs. He used to go standing in a truck to work in the morning reading his course book. Interestingly he never attended college or university. He had the responsibility of feeding his whole family thus he never got time to attend any institution. He enrolled at the Punjab University and just sat his papers. The highlight of his part-time job career was him working as a stenographer for Jamshed Nusserwanjee Mehta. Mehta was the first ever mayor of Karachi. He took office in 1934 when Sindh was for the first time separated from the Bombay Presidency. He was currently working as Chairman of Sindh Purchasing Board when Khan worked as his stenographer. Naimatullah Khan later went on to become the mayor of Karachi himself. Khan completed his intermediate, BA, and a double MA in journalism and Persian. He also did his LLB. He then started working in the office of a lawyer. In the meantime Khan and his family become deeply saddened by the demise of Khan's eldest sister who died at a very young age. Khan recalls that he had gone to work and when he returned he was informed that his sister had died and was even buried. Lack of communication in those days meant Khan couldn't be informed of the death. The lawyer whose office Khan worked at once asked Khan "Naimat, have you completed your studies?". Khan replied yes. He told Khan to start his own work. This proved to be the turning point in Khan's financial fortune. He up until then used to earn Rs 225 per month. He started his work in early 1958 as an income tax lawyer after taking out a 5000 rupee loan from a friend. He set up his office in Wazir Mansion I.I.Chundrigar Road. Conditions soon turned into his favour. Just months after he set up his work, martial law was imposed in Pakistan and Ayub Khan announced that whoever had not paid his income tax wont be prosecuted if he/she paid the tax up until a later date. This proved to be fruitful for Khan and many people poured into his office each day to file their tax returns thus providing Khan with loads of clients which meant a healthy income for him. Khan was finally out of poverty.
Entering politics.
Khan was married in 1960. He built himself a proper house in 1967 in which he lived until 2011. Naimatullah Khan was always inspired by the writings and works of Maulana Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami. His enternce into politics started as far back as late 1960s when he helped organise political programs at his own house. He formally joined the party in 1974 while at Hajj in Makkah. Khan worked diligently for the party slowing rising through the ranks. In 1977 Khan was jailed in Sukkur for holding a rally in Karachi at a time when public gatherings were not allowed due to orders by then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Khan spent three months in jail. Khan recalls how he met the infamous General Niazi at the Sukkur jail. Martial law was imposed in 1977 and elections were held in 1979. Khan was the top most contender to become the mayor of Karachi. Citing personal issues Khan refused to take the office. Khan at that time had nine kids most of whom were very young. Khan realised his children were too young for him to take such an important role. As his replacement Abdul Sattar Afghani was made the mayor who served in the capacity until 1987 after getting re-elected in 1983. Non political elections were held in 1985 and Khan won the PS-81 constituency from Karachi. He subsequently became the Leader of Opposition of the Sindh Assembly from 1985–88. President Zia-ul-Haq was killed in a plane crash in 1988 and all the prevailing assemblies were dissolved. Khan later became the Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer of Karachi in 1990. He served in this capacity until 2001 when he had to resign to take the office of the Mayor of Karachi. In the meantime Khan also retired from his law practice in 1991 after a 34-year career.
Mayor of Karachi.
Martial Law was imposed on 12 October 1999. President Musharraf formulated the new system of CDGK (City District Government Karachi). Elections were held in 2001 and Jamaat-e-Islami was able to win 12 town nazim seats out of 20. Naimatullah Khan serving at that time as the party Ameer of Karachi was nominated as the contender for the Mayor of Karachi. Having already won the majority, he was elected as the first mayor of the newly formed local body system. During his tenure he oversaw the Taameer-e-Karachi program aimed at improving the infrastructure of Karachi. He achieved over the years of his tenure to increase the budget of Karachi from 6 billion rupees to 43 billion rupees. He passed various projects such as 18 flyovers, six underpasses, two signal free roads and a huge water supply scheme for the people of Karachi. It was the first time in the history of Karachi that all the stake holders were incorporated for the developmental works. He was also the person behind the project which built dozens of Model Town Parks in Karachi. Many of his projects were completed in the tenure of the next mayor. For his tremendous work he was shortlisted for the World Mayor of the Year but due to local body election rules he had to resign just before his tenure ended which meant he could no longer compete for the title. Most importantly he is one of the very few people in the history of Pakistan to hold such an important and prestigious office and still remain free of any corruption charges. Even his opponents laud him for this.
Personal life.
Khan was married in 1960 to Tahira Khatoon. He has seven sons and two daughters. All are married. His wife died in 1994 after a protracted illness. He had two sisters, both of whom have died; one of his brothers is also dead.His sons are Waseem, Nadeem, Faheem, Kaleem, Naeem, Asim, Nazim. His daughters are Gohar Lubna and Gohar Afshan. All the sons' middle name is "Iqbal" after the late sister of Khan whose name was Iqbal.
Khan also wrote a book called "Roshni ka safar" that talked about all the work he had done as mayor.
Charity work.
After retiring from politics in 2005, Khan took the office of the President of Alkhidmat Foundation an NGO. He served in that capacity until 2011 when due to age and illness he just decided to look after the southern region of Alkhidmat Foundation. He has extensively worked in the Thar region of Pakistan since 1997 trying to bring that area out of problems such as acute water shortages and illiteracy.

Lex Karpela

The 2005 amendment to the Finnish Copyright Act and Criminal Code, commonly known as Lex Karpela, was an amendment to make the Finnish copyright legislation and criminal code comply with the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC. It was presented to the President of Finland by Culture Minister Tanja Karpela.
The amendment was accepted by the Finnish parliament in a vote on October 5, 2005. It came into effect on January 1, 2006.
Purpose.
The purpose of the amendment was to update the copyright legislation for the special features of digital and network environments, and apply the changes required by the EU Copyright Directive. The amendment additionally includes national legislation solutions independent of the directive.
The main features of the amendment are:
Controversy.
Prohibition of circumventing copy protection.
The section "50 a §" of the new law prohibits copying works for personal use if the work is protected by an "effective technical measure". Even an effective protection may be circumvented to watch or listen to the work, though.
The restriction has been a subject of controversy and the interpretation is yet to see. Open questions are e.g. whether it's legal to circumvent a copy protection to convert the work to a format usable on a portable MP3 player, or whether a copy-protected CD can be reproduced as a standards-compliant audio CD to listen to it on a car radio.
Freedom of speech.
Section "50 b §" mainly prohibits distributing products or services that make possible or facilitate the circumvention of copy protection. The preamble says that offering these services in an organized or commercial manner would be the kind of distribution that the law refers to. This has been seen as restricting the freedom of speech.
Reception.
A demonstration against the bill was held in the afternoon of October 4, 2005. According to an estimate by the police, roughly 300 people participated. Almost all attendees were young adults and all political youth organizations from political right to left supported the demonstration.

Edwina Booth

Edwina Booth (September 13, 1904 – May 18, 1991) was an American actress. She is best known for the 1931 film "Trader Horn", during the filming of which she contracted an illness which effectively ruined her movie career.
Career.
Born Josephine Constance Woodruff, the daughter of a doctor, in Provo, Utah, Booth's brief film career began in 1928 with the Dorothy Arzner-directed "Manhattan Cocktail". She was on vacation following a 1927 stage appearance when film director E. Mason Hopper saw her and offered her a part in a Marie Prevost picture. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was impressed with her, and cast Booth in supporting roles. Her chance for stardom came when the studio cast her in its new jungle epic "Trader Horn" opposite Harry Carey. MGM gave the production a fairly large budget, and sent cast and crew on location in East Africa. Until 1929, the only films shot in Africa were travelogues, but MGM was hoping the idea of "location shooting" might increase the film's commercial appeal. The crew was inexperienced and ill-equipped for filming in Africa, a problem exacerbated by MGM's last-minute decision to shoot the film with sound.
In addition to coping with the heat and insects, Booth contracted malaria during shooting. (In an interview with Dick Cavett in the 1970s, Katharine Hepburn said Booth contracted schistosomiasis.) Her role in the film as "The White Goddess" required her to be scantily clad, likely increasing her susceptibility. Production went on for several months (much longer than average production time in those days), and the film wasn't released until 1931. Despite many problems with the film's production, "Trader Horn" was a success, securing an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.
Booth fared much worse; it took her six years to fully recover physically. She sued MGM for over a million dollars, claiming she had been provided with inadequate protection and inadequate clothing during the African shoot. She claimed she had been forced to sunbathe nude for extended periods during filming. The case received a lot of attention in the tabloids and was eventually settled out of court. According to some sources, the terms were not disclosed; however, Brigham Young University archives indicate she settled for $35,000.
Booth's acting career never recovered from the MGM debacle. Neither MGM nor the other major studios had any intentions of employing her, which created an opportunity for producer Nat Levine of the low-budget Mascot Pictures. Levine saw a chance to capitalize on the success of "Trader Horn" by reuniting its stars Harry Carey and Edwina Booth for two adventure serials, "The Vanishing Legion" and "The Last of the Mohicans". The films were successful within their limited market, but failed to propel Booth's movie career forward. 
Later years.
Booth withdrew completely from the public eye, although she continued to receive fan mail for the rest of her life. She declared that she would be dedicating all of her future leisure and a large proportion of her earnings to the alleviation of human suffering, "My years of illness have not been wasted," she informed the local press. "I have learned to love mankind." She became more active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, frequently attending the Los Angeles California Temple. 
Marriages.
Booth was married three times. Anthony Shuck, her first husband, had their marriage annulled soon after her return from Africa. She married her second husband, Urial Leo Higham on November 21, 1951; he died in 1957. Her third husband was Reinold Fehlberg. They were married from 1959 until his death in 1983. There were many false rumors and reports of her demise until her actual death in 1991. She had no children. She is buried in Santa Monica's Woodlawn Cemetery.

Boston Park Plaza Hotel &amp; Towers

The Boston Park Plaza is a former Statler Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts opened on March 10, 1927, built by hotelier E.M. Statler. A prototype of the grand American hotel, it was called a "city within a city". It was the first hotel in the world to offer in-room radio in every room.
Boston Park Plaza is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
During the hotel's construction, it was discovered that the Statler's planned 155 foot height exceeded the maximum height of 125 feet allowed by the Massachusetts State Building Code. However the building was granted a special exemption by Mayor James Michael Curley, making it the tallest building in the city for a time, with the exception of the Boston Custom House. The building, filling an entire triangular city block, has two uses. The western half houses the hotel, while the eastern half has, since the building's construction, served as offices.
The Statler chain was sold to Hilton Hotels in 1954 and the hotel was renamed the The Statler Hilton Boston. The hotel was again sold in 1976 to the Irving M. Saunders family and renamed the Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers.
has a McCormick and Schmick's steakhouse in it...while Smith and Wollensky steakhouse is in the castle across the street.
In the 1990s Trans World Airlines operated a ticket office in the hotel building. Delta Air Lines also had a ticket office in the building.
In 2010 the hotel's Swan's Cafe was named one of Yankee Magazine's Best 5 New England Teahouses.
Park Plaza Castle.
The hotel operates the Park Plaza Castle, a banquet facility located in the adjacent former Armory of the First Corps of Cadets building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Alive and Schticking

"Alive and Schticking" is the season premiere of the American television series "Will & Grace"s eighth season. It was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode was broadcast live on NBC in the United States on September 29, 2005, and was performed twice by the actors that evening for the East and West coasts. Alec Baldwin guest starred in "Alive and Schticking" and received an Emmy Award nomination for his performance.
In the episode, Grace (Debra Messing) contemplates having an affair with a married man, while Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a new career as the host of his new talk show "Jack Talk". Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) tries to hide from Karen (Megan Mullally) the fact that her husband, Stan, is alive and faked his death due to troubles with the mob. Will also tries to stop his former boss, Malcolm (Baldwin), from dating Karen.
"Will & Grace" creators and executive producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick were in favor of doing a live episode, and Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, thought it would be a good way to inaugurate the final season of the show. Since airing, "Alive and Schticking" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who enjoyed watching the mistakes made by the actors and their attempts to hide their laughter during the live broadcast. The episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.81 and garnered the series' highest rating in the 18–49 demographic since February 17, 2005, and biggest overall viewer total since February 24, 2005.
Plot.
Will (Eric McCormack) reveals to his friend Grace (Debra Messing) that Karen's (Megan Mullally) husband Stan is still alive. He learned this from his former boss, Malcolm (Alec Baldwin), a secret agent, who told him that Stan is now living under seclusion and faked his death because of troubles with the mob. Will makes Grace promise that she keep this information to herself, but she breaks the promise and tells Jack (Sean Hayes). When Malcolm later visits Will at his apartment and warns him to not to tell people about Stan's predicament, Karen and her maid, Rosario (Shelley Morrison), also arrive. At meeting Karen, Malcolm becomes fond of her, as does Karen of him, even asking him out on a date, to which he accepts. Will, however, tells Malcolm that he cannot date Karen because Malcolm is still protecting Stan from the mob.
Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are discussing their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men as a legitimate reason to have an affair with a married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, "Jack Talk", even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.
Production.
"Alive and Schticking" was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that "Will & Grace"'s season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if you let me do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four . It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with."
"Will & Grace" creators and executive producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick were in favor of doing a live episode; "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of "Will & Grace" what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the "challenging live platform launch" for "Will & Grace" would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all "Will & Grace" episodes, commented: "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long as I have been in the business, there are very few firsts."
Upon learning about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards.--> Debra Messing (Grace) "gasped loudly" when it was revealed that the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up in a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, "It starts out our final season in a real special way." Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; "It keeps it interesting for us. It stirs it up. It gives us a new way to do it."
Mullally revealed that the show's writing team was "notorious for tinkering with the script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; "I have a gut feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot and was unable to walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.
"Alive and Schticking" was performed live twice for viewers in the East and West coasts, with different jokes for each broadcast. The first show was broadcast at 8:30 p.m. (ET) for the East and the second three hours later at 11:30 p.m. ET (8:30pm PT) for the West. During the two performances, Messing and Hayes had "attacks of the giggles". An audience member who was in attendance commented that Messing and Hayes "were so bad at keeping a straight face" during a dress rehearsal that Burrows had to get on the show's PA system to yell at them. After both telecasts were aired, Burrows revealed that McCormack, Messing, Hayes, Mullally, and Baldwin "had a ball, but they also dreaded it."
Reception.
In its original American broadcast, "Alive and Schticking" was watched by 9.81 million households, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode received a 4.4 rating/11 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic. It also scored the series' highest 18–49 rating since February 17, 2005, and biggest overall viewer total since February 24, 2005. "Alive and Schticking" finished 21st in the weekly ratings for the week of September 26–October 2, 2005. In 2006, Baldwin was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series" category for this episode.
"Alive and Schticking" received positive reviews. "Fort Worth Star-Telegram" contributor Robert Philpot, who gave the episode a B+ rating, thought it was a pleasant surprise and an indication that there "might be some life" left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that "Will & Grace" still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...]". Dana Stevens of "Slate" magazine reported that "Alive and Schticking" offered a chance to punch up the show with some "unusually broad sight gags." She wrote that the real reason to watch the episode were the mistakes made by the actors.
Philpot continued that moments like Will and his boss making out recalled the show's "glory days", and Messing's trouble keeping a straight face "brought back fond memories of Tim Conway cracking up Harvey Korman on "The Carol Burnett Show"." "Knoxville News Sentinel"'s writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of "The Carol Burnett Show" because of its "goofiness and by-the-seat-of-its-pants style." Morrow added that the episode made him laugh more than any other sitcom on network television. Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that "Alive and Schticking" helped "jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons" and "It's fun [...] to see the actors momentarily break character, a la "The Carol Burnett Show", where the absurdity of certain situations (usually involving Jack and/or Karen) makes giggling all but impossible." "Entertainment Weekly" television critic Gary Susman gave "Alive and Schticking" four stars, while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a "fun, and attention-grabbing, note." "The Hollywood Reporter"'s Ray Richmond said "In hindsight, this live thing proved a good idea."
"Alive and Schticking" received less positive reviews as well. Gail Pennington of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" wrote that the live episode "proved once and for all that "Will & Grace" should have been buried before now," and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk pointed out that its underlying storyline "is a little too over-the-top." Jessica Banov of the "The Fayetteville Observer" wrote, "The first live show ... was so-so. The lighting was weird, and I'm not sure what was up with Debra Messing's hair. But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle." Cinquemani commented that Baldwin's "absurd" role as Malcolm "is proving to be one of "Will & Grace"'s most enduring guest stars." David Blum of "The New York Sun" reported that the producers of "Will & Grace" wasted Baldwin's "prodigious talents on a supporting role this past season, when it's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series." Kauffman concluded that Grace's joke about George Bush being brain dead "just falls amazingly flat".

Querent

Querent as "one who seeks" is derived, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, from the Latin "quærēns" "seeker," the present participle of "quærere" "to seek, gain, ask."
It is clear that Querent became used to denote "a person who questions an Oracle" because it is usually when you have a problem that requires Otherworldly advice that you would seek out the oracle in the first place. This oracle may simply be a divinatory technique, such as the I Ching, that is manipulated by the Querent themselves without recourse to any other human agency. Alternatively it may involve another person, someone perhaps seen as a "fortune teller" — particularly a Practitioner of Tarot reading or other form of Mediumship — from whom advice is sought. 
The kinds of questions asked by a Querent may vary widely according to their needs, and the methodology of the divination system. Some Querents seek general advice trusting that they will be told what is most pertinent to their present situation. Others will ask questions that are only slightly more direct such as, "Will I be rich?" and "What kind of person will I marry?" Still others seek specific advice. Although opinions are divided amongst Practitioners of various divinatory arts as to what constitutes a 'good' question: some say that questions in the form of "What would be likely to happen if I followed course of action X?" is potentially more useful to a Querent than "Should I follow course of action X?" Yes and no questions are not always best because of the finality they represent, besides usually most Querents are after far more than just Yes and No.
The mindset of a Querent plays a significant role in the development of a clear and dynamic reading. Those who approach a reading with heavy skepticism, especially if they are dealing with a human oracle, are often unwilling to engage the Reader at all which can result in a stifling of the prophetic flow that is so intrinsic to divination. Conversely, some approach with great respect, as if they predetermine that the Diviner or the system of divination is influence by some kind of higher, even divine, power and thereby will believe virtually anything they are told. A third ideal group will talk freely with a human oracle and accept their advice with a healthy dose of skepticism, yet still remain open minded to the possibility of revelation.
These Querent attitudes often stem from their personal beliefs concerning spirituality and the nature of the particular oracular system they are consulting. Common theories that inform these attitudes divide generally into three classes:

CKAT

CKAT is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 600 AM in North Bay, Ontario. The station, owned by Rogers Media, airs a country music, news and sports format.
The station originally launched in 1967 at 93.7 FM, and was acquired by Northern Broadcasting, the owners of CFCH.
In 1979, CKAT adopted a country music format and moved to 101.9 FM. In 1980, CKAT and CFCH were sold to Telemedia.
In 1996, Telemedia swapped the stations in a move similar to its 1990 switch involving CKSO and CIGM in Sudbury. CKAT took over CFCH's AM frequency, and CFCH moved to the FM station and adopted the new callsign CKFX.
In 2002, Telemedia sold the stations to Standard Broadcasting, who shortly sold them to Rogers.
In fall 2005, CKAT and CIGM underwent a format change, with country music cut back (although not entirely eliminated) in favour of increased news and sports programming. Since the change, both stations used the following slogans such as "Today's Country", "News Leader" and "Sports Leader".
The station's general manager is Peter McKeown, a former morning man for many years on CHUR and CKAT.
In 2009, CKAT's sister station CIGM in Sudbury (under the ownership of Rogers Media) was acquired by Newcap Radio and then converted the station to the FM dial. CKAT is currently one of the last high-powered commercial AM radio stations operating in Northern Ontario.
On July 2, 2013, at 3:00 pm, Rogers dropped the AM 600 CKAT branding with slogan "North Bay's News Leader/Today's Country" and rebranded CKAT as Country 600, "Today's Best Country".

<doc id="2844597" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844597" title="Available seat miles">
Available seat miles

Available Seat Miles (ASM) is a measure of an airline flight's passenger carrying capacity. It is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometres flown. An available seat mile is the fundamental unit of production for a passenger-carrying airline. A unit in this case is one seat, available for sale, flown one mile. For example, an aircraft with 300 seats available for sale flying 1,000 statute miles would generate 300,000 ASMs for that particular flight. That the seats are available for sale is critical. An aircraft that had 300 seats but which was limited (for regulatory or technical reasons) to filling only 250 of them on a particular flight of 1,000 miles would generate 250,000 ASMs on that flight, not 300,000. Similarly, if passenger seats on a particular flight are dedicated to crew rest purposes, such seats would not be included in the calculation of ASMs for that flight.
Related quantities.
Cost per ASM (CASM).
CASM is a commonly used measure of unit cost in the airline industry. CASM is expressed in cents to operate each seat mile offered, and is determined by dividing operating costs by ASMs. This number is frequently used to allow a cost comparison between different airlines or for the same airline across different time periods (say for one year vs the preceding year). A lower CASM means that it is easier for the airline to make a profit, as they have to charge less to break even. A low CASM, however, is by no means a guarantee of profitability. Further, CASM should only be compared across airlines with care. For instance, all other things being equal, an airline with a longer average stage length will have a lower CASM, because fixed costs will account for a lower portion of its total costs. For this reason, to be meaningful, CASM comparisons across different airlines generally require, at a minimum, that CASMs for all airlines be adjusted to a common stage length, or that the CASMs be graphed versus the stage length of all the airlines being compared.
CASM is generally calculated for a particular airline (or portion of an airline—for instance, an airline's Pacific operations as opposed to the entire airline) for a particular period of time—a year, a quarter, a month and so forth. It can also be calculated for a particular route of an airline. However, when it is calculated for anything other than the entire operation of an airline, the relevant costs will inevitably involve cost allocations that require judgments. For instance, the salary of the airline's senior management needs to be spread across the different parts of the airline and can be divvied up across its routes according to many different methodologies—by the number of flights on that route during that time period, by the number of flight hours on that route, etc. There is not necessarily any right method for making such cost allocations, but it is important when making comparisons across airlines that if an allocation methodology is relevant (i.e. less than the entire of each airline is being compared) then the same allocation methodology is used with each airline being compared.
For a simple example of the calculation of CASM, in the second quarter of 2011, Southwest Airlines (including its AirTran subsidiary) had operating costs of $3.929 bn and 31.457 bn ASMs, as reflected in Southwest's SEC Form 10-Q for that period. Southwest's system CASM for the second quarter of 2011 was then:
CASM = Direct Operating Cost / Available Seat Mile = $3.929 billion / 31.457 billion = 12.49 cents
Ex-fuel CASM or CASM ex-fuel.
CASM excluding fuel is a commonly used measure to compare the cost performance of airlines excepting the cost of fuel. Due to the volatility of oil prices, airline fuel cost is generally not viewed as controllable (other in the short-term via fuel hedging). Therefore, management's success at controlling costs is often judged by looking at how the airline's ex-fuel CASM changes from one period to another. For instance, in the second quarter of 2011 Southwest Airlines had fuel costs of $1.527 bn (again, including its AirTran subsidiary). Southwest's system CASM ex-fuel for the second quarter of 2011 was then:
CASM ex-fuel = (Direct Operating Cost - Fuel Cost) / Available Seat Mile = ($3.929 billion - $1.527 billion) / 31.457 billion = 7.63 cents
Again, care must be taken in comparing CASM ex-fuel across periods. In particular, if average stage length for the airline has changed significantly, this could have a significant impact on CASM ex-fuel.
Revenue per ASM (RASM).
RASM is a commonly used measure of unit revenue for airlines, expressed in cents received for each available seat mile and determined by dividing various measures of operating revenue by Available Seat Miles. This number is frequently used to allow a comparison between different airlines or a comparison of the same airline across periods. In theory, the higher the RASM the more profitable the airline should be, assuming that the CASM remains constant. Various measures of revenue may be used. Passenger RASM (or PRASM) is passenger (or scheduled ticket) revenue per ASM. Operating RASM or Total RASM is the airline's total operating revenue per ASM. 
So, for instance, in the second quarter of 2011, Southwest had scheduled revenue of $3.876 bn and total operating revenue of $4.136 bn. Southwest's system Passenger RASM and Operating RASM for the second quarter of 2011 were therefore:
Passenger RASM = $3.876 billion / 31.457 billion = 12.32 cents
Operating RASM = $4.136 billion / 31.457 billion = 13.15 cents
Again, RASM comparisons across periods or across airlines also need to be made with care. All else being equal, revenue generally increases with average stage length. However, revenue generally does not increase as quickly as stage length, meaning that RASM typically decreases as average stage length increases.

Richard of Salerno

Richard of Salerno ( 1060 – 1114), who is not to be confused with his homonym cousin Richard of Hauteville, was a participant in the First Crusade and regent of the County of Edessa from 1104 to 1108.
Richard was born around 1060, the third son of William of the Principate, a Norman count, and Mary, daughter of Guido, the Lombard duke of Sorrento. He was also one of the many nephews of Robert Guiscard and Roger I of Sicily and in his early life Richard participated with his two famous uncles to the conquest of Sicily.
In 1097, Richard joined his cousins, Bohemund of Taranto and Tancred, on the First Crusade. Richard and Tancred were notable for being among the few Crusaders who could speak Arabic, an ability doubtlessly learned during the wars in Sicily, which had a strong Arab presence. Anna Komnene relates that when Richard crossed the Adriatic Sea, his ship was attacked and captured by the Byzantine fleet, who had mistaken him for a pirate. He was soon released and joined the main Crusader army marching through Bulgaria and Hungary. Along with Tancred, Richard refused to swear an oath of fidelity to the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, preferring to cross the Bosphorus in secret.
Richard was one of the commanders at the Battle of Dorylaeum in summer 1097. 1098, Richard and Tancred joined Bohemund at the siege of Antioch. Richard was among those captured with Bohemund in 1100 when ambushed by the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. From there Richard was sent to the emperor Alexius, who imprisoned him in Constantinople before he was finally released in 1103. His cousin Tancred then appointed him governor of Edessa in the winter of 1104, a city which he ruled until 1108. He was bitterly hated by the citizens of Edessa for being ruthless and greedy. During this time, Richard also acted as a diplomat, traveling to France and Italy and arranging the marriage of Bohemund to the princess Constance of France. He was a witness of the 1108 Treaty of Devol. He also participated in the ultimately disastrous campaigns Bohemund waged against the emperor Alexius, but may have been secretly plotting with Alexius against Bohemund. After Bohemund's death in 1111, Richard retired to Marash, where he died in the great earthquake of November 29, 1114.
By his wife Altrude, daughter of Emma of Hauteville and Odo the Good Marquis, he had a son, Roger of Salerno, who was the regent of the Principality of Antioch. His daughter Maria married Joscelin I, Count of Edessa.

Hiroaki Aoki

, known in the United States by the Anglicized name Rocky Aoki, was a Japanese-born American wrestler and restauranteur.
Biography.
Early life.
Born in Tokyo, Aoki and some friends started a rock and roll band called Rowdy Sounds, though Aoki eventually abandoned music for athletics. He would later explain, "I play bass. But I tell you why I change to wrestling: No good on tempo." Aoki attended Keio University, where he competed in track and field, karate and wrestling before being expelled for fighting. He qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, but did not compete. However, he later toured the United States and was undefeated in the wrestling 112-pound flyweight class. 
Aoki was offered wrestling scholarships from several different American colleges. He attended Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts and later transferred to CW Post College on Long Island.
Move to the United States.
He moved to New York City, going on to win the United States flyweight title in 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1995.
Restaurant business.
In New York, Aoki worked seven days a week in an ice cream truck that he rented in Harlem while studying restaurant management at New York City Community College. After he received his Associates degree in management in 1963, he used the $10,000 he had saved from the ice cream business to convince his father to co-invest in the first Benihana, a four-table teppanyaki restaurant on West 56th Street. "Benihana", taken from the Japanese name for safflower, was suggested by Aoki's father. According to family legend, Aoki's father was walking through the bombed-out ruins of post-war Tokyo when he happened across a single red safflower growing in the rubble. 
He was an offshore powerboat racer along with the 1986 APBA world champion Powerboat throttleman Errol Lanier, a former Fort Lauderdale fireman who saved his life in a near fatal powerboat crash in 1979 under the Golden Gate Bridge. After injuries suffered in a 1982 accident, the Tenafly, New Jersey resident told sportswriters that he was leaving the sport.
Family life.
Rocky once said that he had 'three kids from three different women at exactly the same time'. He found out about the third child with the third woman when he was sued for paternity. In 2005, Rocky sued four of his children (Grace, Kevin, Kyle, and Echo) for an alleged attempt to take control of the companies he founded, which, at the time, had an estimated value between USD $60–100 million. 
Before his death, he had become a United States citizen. Aoki was the recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. He died of pneumonia in New York. At the time of his death he had been suffering from diabetes, Hepatitis C, and cirrhosis of the liver. His Hepatitis C was reportedly the result of a blood transfusion after a 1979 speedboat crash under the Golden Gate Bridge.

Aircraft maintenance checks

Aircraft maintenance checks are periodic inspections that have to be done on all commercial/civil aircraft after a certain amount of time or usage; military aircraft normally follow specific maintenance programmes which may or may not be similar to those of commercial/civil operators. Airlines and other commercial operators of large or turbine-powered aircraft follow a continuous inspection program approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, or by other airworthiness authorities such as Transport Canada or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Under FAA oversight, each operator prepares a Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP) under its Operations Specifications or "OpSpecs".
The CAMP includes both routine and detailed inspections. Airlines and airworthiness authorities casually refer to the detailed inspections as "checks", commonly one of the following: A check, B check, C check, or D check. A and B checks are lighter checks, while C and D are considered heavier checks.
A Check.
This is performed approximately every 500 - 800 flight hours or 200 - 400 cycles. It needs about 20 - 50 man-hours and is usually performed overnight at an airport gate or hangar. The actual occurrence of this check varies by aircraft type, the cycle count (takeoff and landing is considered an aircraft "cycle"), or the number of hours flown since the last check. The occurrence can be delayed by the airline if certain predetermined conditions are met.
B Check.
This is performed approximately every 4–6 months. It needs about 150 man-hours and is usually performed within 1–3 days at an airport hangar. A similar occurrence schedule applies to the B check as to the A check. B checks 
may be incorporated into successive A checks, i.e.: A-1 through A-10 complete all the B check items.
C Check.
This is performed approximately every 20–24 months or a specific amount of actual flight hours (FH) or as defined by the manufacturer. This maintenance check is much more extensive than a B Check, requiring a large majority of the aircraft's components to be inspected. This check puts the aircraft out of service and until it is completed, the aircraft must not leave the maintenance site. It also requires more space than A and B Checks—usually a hangar at a maintenance base. The time needed to complete such a check is generally 1–2 weeks and the effort involved can require up to 6000 man-hours. The schedule of occurrence has many factors and components as has been described, and thus varies by aircraft category and type.
D Check.
This is by far the most comprehensive and demanding check for an airplane. It is also known as a Heavy Maintenance Visit (HMV). This check occurs approximately every 5 years. It is a check that, more or less, takes the entire airplane apart for inspection and overhaul. Also, if required, the paint may need to be completely removed for further inspection on the fuselage metal skin. Such a check can usually demand up to 50,000 man-hours and it can generally take up to 2 months to complete, depending on the aircraft and the number of technicians involved. It also requires the most space of all maintenance checks, and as such must be performed at a suitable maintenance base. Given the elevated requirements of this check and the tremendous effort involved in it, it is also by far the most expensive maintenance check of all, with total costs for a single visit ending up well within the million-dollar range.
Because of the nature and the cost of such a check, most airlines — especially those with a large fleet — have to plan D Checks for their aircraft years in advance. Often, older aircraft being phased out of a particular airline's fleet are either stored or scrapped upon reaching their next D Check, due to the high costs involved in it in comparison to the aircraft's value. On average, a commercial aircraft undergoes 2–3 D Checks before it is retired. Many Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) shops state that it is virtually impossible to perform a D Check profitably at a shop located within the United States. As such, only a few of these shops offer D checks.
Maintenance Review Board.
Initial aircraft maintenance requirements are proposed in a Maintenance Review Board (MRB) report based on Air Transport Association (ATA) publication MSG-3.
Modern transport category airplanes with MSG-3 derived maintenance programs employ usage parameters for each maintenance requirement such as flight hours, calendar time, or flight cycles. Maintenance intervals based on usage parameters allow more flexibility in scheduling the maintenance program to optimize aircraft utilization and minimize aircraft downtime.

Corticobasal degeneration

Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia. CBD symptoms typically begin in people from 50-70 years of age, and the average disease duration in six years. It is characterized by marked disorders in movement and cognitive dysfunction, and is classified as one of the Parkinson plus syndromes. Clinical diagnosis is difficult, as symptoms of CBD are often similar to those of other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
Due to the various clinical presentations associated with CBD, a final diagnosis can only be made upon neuropathologic examination. Patients who are suffering from this devastaing disorder can learn more about CBD and reach out to others with the same condition for support, through The Foundation for PSP | CBD and Related Brain Diseases, also known as CurePSP.
Background and History.
CBD was first identified by Rebeiz and his associates in 1968, as they observed three individuals who exhibited characteristic symptoms of the unique and previously unknown disorder. They initially referred to the neurodegenerative disease as “corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia,” after which various other names were used, including “corticonigral degeneration with nuclear achromasia” and “cortical basal ganglionic degeneration.” Although the underlying cause of CBD is unknown, the disease occurs as a result of damage to the basal ganglia, specifically marked by neuronal degeneration or depigmentation (loss of melanin in a neuron) in the substantia nigra. Additional distinguishing neurological features of those diagnosed with CBD consist of asymmetric atrophy of the frontal and parietal cortical regions of the brain. Postmortem studies of patients diagnosed with CBD indicate that histological attributes often involve ballooning of neurons, gliosis, and tauopathy. Much of the pioneering advancements and research performed on CBD has been completed within the past decade or so, due to the relatively recent formal recognition of the disease.
Occurrence and Epidemiology.
Clinical presentation of CBD usually does not occur until age 60, with the earliest recorded diagnosis and subsequent postmortem verification being age 28. Although men and women present with the disease, some analysis has shown a predominant appearance of CBD in women. Current calculations suggest that the prevalence of CBD is approximately 4.9 to 7.3 per 100,000 people. The prognosis for an individual diagnosed with CBD is death within approximately eight years, although some patients have been diagnosed over 13 years ago (1999) and are still in relatively good standing, but with serious debilitation such as dysphagia, and overall limb rigidity. The partial (or total) use of a feeding tube may be necessary and will help prevent aspiration pneumonia, primary cause of death in CBD. Incontinence is common, as patients often can't express their need to go, due to eventual loss of speech. Therefore proper hygiene is mandatory to prevent urinary tract infections. 
Symptoms and Clinical Presentation.
Because CBD is progressive (it gradually worsens), a set of standard diagnostic criteria can be used, which is centered on the disease’s evolution. Included in these fundamental features are problems with cortical processing, dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and a sudden and detrimental onset. Psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, although present in CBD, are much less prevalent and lack establishment as common indicators of the presence of the disease.
Motor and Associated Cortical Dysfunctions.
Some of the most prevalent symptom types in people exhibiting CBD pertain to identifiable movement disorders and problems with cortical processing. These symptoms are initial indicators of the presence of the disease. Each of the associated movement complications typically appear asymmetrically and the symptoms are not observed uniformly throughout the body. For example, a person exhibiting an alien hand syndrome (explained later) in one hand, will not correspondingly display the same symptom in the contralateral limb. Predominant movement disorders and cortical dysfunctions associated with CBD include:
Parkinsonism.
The presence of parkinsonism as a clinical symptom of CBD is largely responsible for complications in developing unique diagnostic criteria for the disease. Other such diseases in which parkinsonism forms an integral diagnostic characteristic are PD and PSP. Parkinsonism in CBD is largely present in an extremity such as the arm, and is always asymmetric. Common associated movement dysfunctions that comprise parkinsonism are rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disorder, with limb rigidity forming the most typical manifestation of parkinsonism in CBD. Despite being relatively indistinct, this rigidity can lead to disturbances in gait and correlated movements. Bradykinesia in CBD occurs when there is notable slowing in the completion of certain movements in the limbs. In an associated study, it was determined that, three years following first diagnosis, 71% of persons with CBD demonstrate the presence of bradykinesia.
Alien Hand Syndrome.
Alien hand syndrome has been shown to be prevalent in roughly 60% of those people diagnosed with CBD. This disorder involves the failure of an individual to control the movements of his or her hand, which results from the sensation that the limb is “foreign.” The movements of the alien limb are a reaction to external stimuli and do not occur sporadically or without stimulation. The presence of an alien limb has a distinct appearance in CBD, in which the diagnosed individual may have a “tactile mitgehen.” This mitgehen (German, meaning “to go with”) is relatively specific to CBD, and involves the active following of an experimenter’s hand by the subject’s hand when both hands are in direct contact. Another, rarer form of alien hand syndrome has been noted in CBD, in which an individual’s hand displays an avoidance response to external stimuli. Additionally, sensory impairment, revealed through limb numbness or the sensation of prickling, may also concurrently arise with alien hand syndrome, as both symptoms are indicative of cortical dysfunction. Like most of the movement disorders, alien hand syndrome also presents asymmetrically in those diagnosed with CBD.
Apraxia.
Ideomotor apraxia (IMA), although clearly present in CBD, often manifests atypically due to the additional presence of bradykinesia and rigidity in those individuals exhibiting the disorders. The IMA symptom in CBD is characterized by the inability to repeat or mimic particular movements (whether significant or random) both with or without the implementation of objects. This form of IMA is present in the hands and arms, while IMA in the lower extremities may cause problems with walking. Those with CBD that exhibit IMA may appear to have trouble initiating walking, as the foot may appear to be fixed to floor. This can cause stumbling and difficulties in maintaining balance. IMA is associated with deterioration in the premotor cortex, parietal association areas, connecting white matter tracts, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Some individuals with CBD exhibit limb-kinetic apraxia, which involves dysfunction of more fine motor movements often performed by the hands and fingers.
Aphasia.
Aphasia in CBD is revealed through the inability to speak or a difficulty in initiating spoken dialogue and falls under the non-fluent (as opposed to fluent or flowing) subtype of the disorder. This may be related to speech impairment such as dysarthria, and thus is not a true aphasia, as aphasia is related to a change in language function, such as difficulty retrieving words or putting words together to form meaningful sentences. The speech and/or language impairments in CBD result in disconnected speech patterns and the omission of words. Individuals with this symptom of CBD often lose the ability to speak as the disease progresses.
Psychiatric and Cognitive Disorders.
Psychiatric problems associated with CBD often present as a result of the debilitating symptoms of the disease. Prominent psychiatric and cognitive conditions cited in individuals with CBD include dementia, depression, and irritability, with dementia forming a key feature that sometimes leads to the misdiagnosis of CBD as another cognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Corticobasal Syndrome.
All of the disorders and dysfunctions associated with CBD can often be categorized into a class of symptoms that present with the disease of CBD. These symptoms that aid in clinical diagnosis are sometimes collectively referred to as corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS). Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, and Progressive supranuclear palsy can display a corticobasal syndrome. It has been suggested that the nomenclature of corticobasal degeneration only be used for naming the disease after it has received verification through postmortem analysis of the neuropathology.
Neuroimaging.
The types of imaging techniques that are most prominently utilized when studying and/or diagnosing CBD are:
Developments or improvements in imaging techniques provide the future possibility for definitive clinical diagnosis prior to death. However, despite their benefits, information learned from MRI and SPECT during the beginning of CBD progression tend to show no irregularities that would indicate the presence of such a neurodegenerative disease. FDOPA PET is used to study the efficacy of the dopamine pathway.
Despite the undoubted presence of cortical atrophy (as determined through MRI and SPECT) in individuals experiencing the symptoms of CBD, this is not an exclusive indicator for the disease. Thus, the utilization of this factor in the diagnosis of CBD should be used only in combination with other clinically present dysfunctions.
MRI.
MRI images are useful in displaying atrophied portions of neuroanatomical positions within the brain. As a result, it is especially effective in identifying regions within different areas of the brain that have been negatively affected due to the complications associated with CBD. To be specific, MRI of CBD typically shows posterior parietal and frontal cortical atrophy with unequal representation in corresponding sides. In addition, atrophy has been noted in the corpus callosum.
Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to evaluate the activation patterns in various regions of the brain of individuals affected with CBD. Upon the performance of simple finger motor tasks, subjects with CBD experienced lower levels of activity in the parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex than those individuals tested in a control group.
SPECT.
SPECT studies of individuals diagnosed with CBD involve perfusion analysis throughout the parts of the brain. SPECT evaluation through perfusion observation consists of monitoring blood release into different locations in tissue or organ regions, which, in the case of CBD, pertains to localized areas within the brain. Tissue can be characterized as experiencing overperfusion, underperfusion, hypoperfusion, or hyperperfusion. Overperfusion and underperfusion relate to a comparison with the overall perfusion levels within the entire body, whereas hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion are calculated in comparison to the blood flow requirements of the tissue in question. In general, the measurements taken for CBD using SPECT are referred to as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).
In general, SPECT reveals hypoperfusion within both the posterior regions of the frontal and parietal lobes. As in images gathered through MRI, SPECT images indicated asymmetry in the presentation of abnormalities throughout the brain. Additional studies have revealed the presence of perfusion anomalies in the thalamus, temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and pontocerebellar (from the pons to the cerebellum) locations within subjects’ brains.
FDOPA PET.
Research has suggested that the integrity of the dopamine system in the striatum has been damaged as an effect of CBD. Current studies employing the use of FDOPA PET scanning (FDOPA PET) as a possible method for identifying CBD have focused on analyzing the efficiency of neurons in the striatum that utilize the neurotransmitter dopamine. These studies have concluded that, in general, dopamine uptake was diminished in the caudate and the putamen. This characteristic also has the potential to be useful in distinguishing CBD from the similar PD, as individuals having been diagnosed with PD were more likely to have a lower uptake of dopamine than in individuals with CBD.
Other clinical tests or procedures that monitor the presence of dopamine within the brain (β-CIT SPECT and IBZM SPECT) have shown similar findings. β-CIT serves as an indicator for presynaptic dopaminergic neurons, whereas IBZM is a tracer that shows an affinity for the postsynaptic neurons of the same type. Despite agreement with other imaging studies, these two SPECT methods suffer some scrutiny due to better accuracy in other imaging methods. However, β-CIT SPECT has proven to be helpful in distinguishing CBD from PSP and multiple system atrophy (MSA).
Histological and Molecular Features.
Neuropathological findings associated with CBD include the presence of astrocytic abnormalities within the brain and improper accumulation of the protein tau (referred to as tauopathy).
Astroglial Inclusions.
Postmortem histological examination of the brains of individuals diagnosed with CBD reveal unique characteristics involving the astrocytes in localized regions. The typical procedure used in the identification of these astroglial inclusions is the Gallyas-Braak staining method. This process involves exposing tissue samples to a silver staining material which marks for abnormalities in the tau protein and astroglial inclusions. Astroglial inclusions in CBD are identified as astrocytic plaques, which present as annularly displays of blurry outgrowths from the astrocyte. A recent study indicated that CBD produces a high density of astrocytic plaques in the anterior portion of the frontal lobe and in the premotor area of the cerebral cortex.
Tauopathy.
The protein tau is an important microtubule-associated protein (MAP), and is typically found in neuronal axons. However, malfunctioning of the development of the protein can result in unnatural, high-level expression in astrocytes and glial cells. As a consequence, this is often responsible for the astrocytic plaques prominently noted in histological CBD examinations. Although they are understood to play a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases such as CBD, their precise effect remains a mystery.
Diagnosis.
Clinical vs. Postmortem.
One of the most significant problems associated with CBD is the inability to perform a definitive diagnosis while an individual exhibiting the symptoms associated with CBD is still alive. A clinical diagnosis of CBD is performed based upon the specified diagnostic criteria, which focus mainly on the symptoms correlated with the disease. However, this often results in complications as these symptoms often overlap with numerous other neurodegenerative diseases. Frequently, a differential diagnosis for CBD is performed, in which other diseases are eliminated based on specific symptoms that do not overlap. However, some of the symptoms of CBD used in this process are rare to the disease, and thus the differential diagnosis cannot always be used.
Postmortem diagnosis provides the only true indication of the presence of CBD. Most of these diagnoses utilize the Gallyas-Braak staining method, which is effective in identifying the presence of astroglial inclusions and coincidental tauopathy.
Overlap with Other Diseases.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is frequently the disease most often confused with CBD. Both PSP and CBD result in similar symptoms, and both display tauopathies upon histological inspection. However, it has been noted that tauopathy in PSP results in tuft-shaped astrocytes in contrast with the doughnut-shaped astrocytic plaques found as a result of CBD.
Individuals diagnosed with PD often exhibit similar movement dysfunction as those diagnosed with CBD, which adds complexity to its diagnosis. Some other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) also show commonalities with CBD. FTDs have also been known to evolve into corticobasal syndrome.
Treatment.
Because the exact cause of CBD is unknown, there exists no formal treatment for the disease. Instead, treatments focus on minimizing the appearance or effect of the symptoms resulting from CBD. The most easily treatable symptom of CBD is parkinsonism, and the most common form of treatment for this symptom is the application of dopaminergic drugs. However, in general only moderate improvement is seen and the relief from the symptom is not long-lasting. In addition, palliative therapies, including the implementation of wheelchairs, speech therapy, and feeding techniques, are often used to alleviate many of the symptoms that show no improvement with drug administration.

Ernani Bernardi

Ernani Bernardi also known as Noni Bernardi and Nani Bernardi was a big-band musician turned politician in Los Angeles, California. He represented District 7 on the City Council there from 1961 to 1993, making him the second-longest-serving council member in the history of the city. He was also the musical arranger for two of the mid-20th century's most popular dance melodies.
Biography.
Bernardi was born on October 29, 1911 above a grocery store his family owned in Standard, Illinois, the son of musician Alfonso Bernardi and Nerina Biagini. His parents were immigrants who came to America by way of Ellis Island, from a small town in the province of Modena in the Emilia Romagna. 
His mother died in childbirth, and he was raised by his father, two grandmothers, an aunt and an uncle. When he was eleven, he was moved to the nearby town of Toluca, Illinois, where he later played varsity basketball.
Bernardi attended the University of Detroit, where he planned to study journalism and become a sportscaster. He was playing saxophone in a dance band at Detroit's Graystone Ballroom when he met Lucille May Sawasky of Port Arthur, Ontario. They were married in 1933 and lived in Detroit briefly before moving to New York. The couple had four children, Joanne Marie Roots, Judith Ann, John Paul and (Ernani) James. They settled in Los Angeles in 1939 or 1940, and Bernardi began his second career as a contractor, building custom homes. After their children were grown, Lucille Bernardi went to work in the county probation department as a records clerk. When older, she suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and Bernardi, by then a City Council member, would bring her to work with him from their home in Van Nuys to watch television in his office. She died in 1993. Ernani Bernardi remarried in November 2001 to Eve Troutman.
Bernardi was described at age 74 in 1985 as "crusty, . . . short, bald and bespectacled," and four years later he was said to have "a puckish sense of humor." As he aged, his hearing deteriorated, and he wore special headphones at council meetings so he could hear what was going on. Even at age 86, he had "a booming voice and aggressive style."
He died of heart failure at the age of 94 on January 4, 2006.
Music.
Bernardi's father, Alfonso, was a music teacher who taught his son how to play the saxophone.
Ernani went on to become a musician, performing under the name Noni Bernardi as lead alto sax for several of big bands of the era such as those of Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Kay Kyser. He was known for his arrangements of Goodman's "And the Angels Sing" and Dorsey's "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You."
Bernardi moved to California in 1940 to perform with Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge. His 
musical prowess was acknowledged in 1994 when at age 82 he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ironically, as the "Los Angeles Times" pointed out, his star—and those of 29 other musicians and actors—was funded by the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, an organization that Bernardi had been fighting with for years. The tribute is in the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard.
The ex-councilman continued playing the sax well into his eighties. In 2000 he was a regular at age 88 with his band booked, among other places, at a retro big band restaurant called Leon's Steak House in North Hollywood. The "Times" reported:
When this guy takes his spot in front of a 16-piece ensemble of blaring trumpets and gleaming saxes—The Way It Was Orchestra, as he calls it—his frail arms start pumping, his toes tap and his body begins to radiate a vigor that energizes the old musicians like swigs from a fountain of youth. . . . nothing stirs the diminutive Bernardi—he's about 5 foot 3, a little over 100 pounds—like his music.
City Council.
Elections.
"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1957 and after."
By 1957 a contractor in the San Fernando Valley, Bernardi ran for the Los Angeles City Council District 7 seat that year but came in third in the primary election, after James C. Corman, the eventual victor, and Kay Bogendorfer. When Corman was elected to Congress, Bernardi ran again in 1961 and was elected. He served eight terms until he retired in 1993.
In 1961, District 7 covered Van Nuys, Sepulveda, Granada Hills and Sylmar, and in 1986 it covered Panorama City, part of Sun Valley and Sylmar. For most of his early terms in office, Bernardi represented a "predominantly white working-class district in the mid-San Fernando Valley." His backers included many Valley tax opponents who were behind the successful passage of California's Proposition 13 anti-tax measure.
In 1986, a 12-vote majority of the City Council moved Bernardi's 7th District to a "largely new" part of the Valley for him, the northeast area, which contained more minorities than his former territory. One "City Hall lobbyist" opined that the measure in some way was a payback for Bernardi's public criticism of his colleagues. Yet he was reelected in 1989 by 55% to 45% over Fire Captain Lyle Hall, "who had more money, a more sophisticated mail campaign and labor unions' support that translated into scores of ready volunteers." Bernardi also picked up support from Latino leaders in his new district.
By the time Bernardi retired in 1993, the 7th District was 70 percent Latino and 19 percent African-American, encompassing one of Los Angeles's poorest areas. Registered voters were 39 percent Anglo, 30 percent Latino and 19 percent African-American.
His tenure of 32 years has been beaten only by the 35 years of Council Member John Ferraro.
Highlights.
Bernardi was nicknamed "Mr. No" because of his opposition to city spending, and he was known as the City Council's "gadfly" because of his "pesky pursuit of lost causes," but in 1985 he was successful in forcing the City Council to put a tough campaign-reform law on the April ballot after he circulated petitions that would have required a vote on an even tougher law. He did this by "enlisting the support of the League of Women Voters and a ragtag group made up mostly of retirees to qualify an initiative for the ballot."
Bernardi listed his campaign-reform success as among his most satisfying achievements, as well as an ordinance requiring all residential developments of five or more units to set aside at least 15 percent of the units for low and moderate-income families. He also supported rent control.
He led successful campaigns for city charter amendments that limited police and firefighter pensions and that did away with a requirement that the city pay comparable wages to those of private industry. "I think he reflects a philosophy of misery" because of his efforts to cut allocations for human services, fellow Councilman David S. Cunningham, Jr. said. The "Los Angeles Times" added:
Yet, there is a compassionate side to Bernardi. After visiting Tent City, a shelter for the homeless set up across from City Hall during the 1984 Christmas season, Bernardi returned to his office and began calling food stores and restaurants to solicit food donations. When a grocery store donated a box of uncooked beans, Bernardi opened up the City Hall kitchen and cooked the beans himself.
He was seen as a "loner" on the 15-member City Council, lacking the spirit of compromise, thus limiting his political effect, yet longtime council president John S. Gibson, Jr. praised him for probably saving the city "millions of dollars over the years with his questioning." In a ceremony marking his 25th anniversary on the council, he was presented with the "no" voting button from his desk, "which Councilman John Ferraro quipped was 'worn out' from overuse."
In 1987 he voted against supporting a Los Angeles Festival of Arts with money and services because it was "chintzy" for a $5.8 million festival to ask for help. He was joined by Council Members Gloria Molina and Nate Holden, who said not enough minority artists were represented.
In 1988 Bernardi provided $70,000 from his $641,978-a-year office budget for police task forces to combat burglaries and drug trafficking in his district, and, even though he supported a lobbying group called FAIR, "devoted to using the harshest possible measures to reduce illegal immigration," he helped establish a hiring hall to get immigrant workers off the street.
Critics claimed that "as an aging white man," he lacked "modern-day sensitivity" when, in August 1989, he called African-American Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas "Curly" during an "emotionally charged discussion of racism." Ridley-Thomas rebuked Bernardi for the "condescending and racist" remark, and Bernardi apologized.
In his last years on the council, he continued casting "no" votes: against building the Metro Rail subway, against establishing a downtown redevelopment project, against declaring Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a city holiday. He said he didn't mind recognizing the civil rights leader, but did not want to give city workers another day off.
One of his final campaigns was against the practice of the City Council drawing its own district boundaries. He urged that instead the boundaries should be set by a special commission of retired Municipal Court judges. In a related comment, on his last day in office he issued a press release applauding the U.S. Supreme Court in its "Shaw v. Reno" decision invalidating the drawing of a serpentine-shaped Congressional district whose parts seemed to have nothing to do with each other than the fact they were inhabited mostly by black people.
Campaign for mayor.
Bernardi ran for mayor of Los Angeles while he was in his last few months on the City Council in 1993, saying that the other candidates failed to address issues that were important to him—mostly slashing the size and cost of government. He ran a low-budget, no-frills campaign, and in the end received just 1 percent of the citywide vote.
Post-council.
In 1994 Bernardi sued the city of Los Angeles and its redevelopment agency, alleging that the agency violated the state's open meetings law when it was considering plans for Downtown Los Angeles. He helped finance the costs of his lawsuit by selling a videocassette of several big bands performing his favorite tunes. Eventually, appellate courts and the state supreme court ruled in favor of Bernardi in the main thrust of his claim, which effectively set a cap on the amount of money the agency could spend on the project.
In the 1990s he spoke against the idea of establishing neighborhood councils as part of a proposed city charter reform process.
In 1999, City Council President John Ferraro appointed Bernardi to a committee to oversee the spending of $744 million in bond funds for police and fire stations.

Tattle Tale

Tattle Tale was an American musical group that existed between 1992 and 1995. Composed of Jen Wood and Madigan Shive, they were well known in the Riot Grrrl scene, playing what was later to be termed folk punk.
The Seattle-based group's song "Glass Vase Cello Case" was featured in the 1999 film "But I'm A Cheerleader" by Jamie Babbit.
Overview.
The group was formed by Jen Wood and Madigan Shive in 1992 at the ages of 15 and 17 respectively. They played on numerous compilations before releasing their first single, titled "Early Daze," which was followed by their second single, "Alderwood Mall."
On November 9, 1993 they released a self-titled demo cassette on the record label Kill Rock Stars, and on July 14, 1995 they released an album titled "Sew True", which is now out of print.
In 1995, the band broke up, with Wood pursuing a solo career and several collaborative efforts including vocals on 2005 releases by The Postal Service, and Shive fronting the chamber-punk group Bonfire Madigan.

Nakayama Miki

According to the Tenrikyo scriptures, in 1838, at the age of 40, she became a medium for God (the religion is essentially monotheistic) after taking part in a Shugendo exorcism ceremony. During the ceremony "God the Parent" spoke through her, saying, "I am God of Origin, God in Truth. There is causality in this Residence. At this time I have descended here to save all humankind. I wish to receive Miki as the Shrine of God."
She stated that its name was Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, but she also referred to it as Tsuki-Hi (literally "Moon-Sun", suggesting cosmic unity) and, as Tenrikyo members still do, "God the Parent" ("Oyagamisama"). After the death of her husband she was claimed to have miraculous healing and prophetic powers, which served the mission that she and her daughter (Kokan) began. They chose a life of poverty, giving away what they could to the less fortunate and founding a new religion.
From 1866 to 1882 Nakayama Miki wrote what she deemed the revelations of "God the Parent", believing herself to be its mouthpiece and shrine, in Ofudesaki. She encouraged a life of charity and designed various spiritual dances. She was repeatedly imprisoned on the initiative of the Buddhist sects, which she and her followers criticised as dispensing false teachings, and in later years Tenrikyo became more assimilated to State Shinto in its teachings, though Nakayama Miki herself opposed this assimilation. Tenrikyo teaches that she still resides at her former home in what is now Tenri City, believed to be the point of origin of humanity.
Secular interpretations of her life and teaching suggest that she took inspiration from an amalgam of Buddhism, Shinto and "yamabushi" tradition. Tenrikyo, while insisting that her teachings were totally original and her thinking uniquely inspired, devotes a department of Tenri University to the secular study of religions of Oyasama's era including pre-Meiji Japanese Christians.

Pass-through certificate

A pass-through certificates (PTC) is an instrument that evidences the ownership of two or more equipment trust certificates. In other words, equipment trust certificates may be bundled into a pass-through structure as a means of diversifying the asset pool and/or increasing the size of the offering. The principal and interest payments on the equipment trust certificates are "passed through" to certificate holders.A Pass Through Certificate is an instrument which signifies transfer of interest in receivables in favor of the holder of the Pass Through Certificate. The investor in a Pass Through transaction acquire the receivables subject to all their fluctuation, prepayments etc. the material risks and rewards in the asset portfolio, such as the risk of interest rate variations, risk of prepayment etc., transferred to the investor.

Amompharetus

Amompharetus, son of Poliadas, was a Spartan company commander at the Battle of Plataea. The name means ""of irreproachable valor"".
Before the battle, both the Greek and Persian armies camped in front of each other for 10 days on the plain of Plateaea, with only small raids on each side. However, the Persians diverted the Greek water supply and cut off their supply of food, so the Greeks were forced to find a new camp.
The plan was for the main contingent of Greeks to set out first during the night, with the Spartans guarding the rear. After the main contingent of Greeks had left the encampment, and it was time for the Spartans to set off to take up the rear, Amompharetus refused to leave the field without a fight, insisting that the unalterable law of Sparta forbade retreat from the battlefield. It took some convincing and rank-pulling on behalf of the Spartan regent, Pausanias, and a not inconsiderable amount of time, to compel Amompharetus and his unit to follow the maneuvering of the rest of the army.
On discovering the Greeks had abandoned their positions and their Spartan allies, the leader of the Persian forces, Mardonius, launched an attack in haste. The Persian offensive was in disarray before battle was joined, and Mardonius soon lay dead and the Persian army crushed. 
There is another mention of Amompharetus (in Plutarch's Solon) as one of the five Spartans arbitrating the dispute over the island of Salamis between the citizens of Athens and Megara. The verdict was in favor of Athens.

Victor Feldman

Victor Stanley Feldman (April 7, 1934 – May 12, 1987) was a British jazz musician, best known as a pianist and percussionist.
Early history.
Feldman caused a sensation as a musical prodigy when he was "discovered", aged seven. His family were all musical and his father founded the Feldman Swing Club in London in 1942 to showcase his talented sons. Feldman's first professional appearance was playing drums at No. 1 Rhythm Club as a member of the Feldman Trio with brothers Robert on clarinet and Monty on piano accordion. He featured in the films "King Arthur Was a Gentleman" (1942) and "Theatre Royal" (1943). In 1944 he was featured at a concert with Glenn Miller's AAAF band, as "Kid Krupa" (in reference to drummer Gene Krupa). His drums teacher Carlo Krahmer encouraged Feldman to play the vibraphone which he did first in the Ralph Sharon Sextet and later in the Roy Fox band. He worked in India in 1952 and 1953 in a band led by pianist Eddie Carroll. His vibraphone and conga drum playing were notable, but it was as a pianist that he became best known. 
Later jazz and U.S. session work.
Before leaving the U.K. in 1955 to work in the U.S., Feldman recorded with Ronnie Scott's orchestra and quintet from 1954 to 1955, which also featured other important British jazz musicians such as Phil Seamen and Hank Shaw. It was Scott who recommended that Feldman emigrate to the U.S., which he did in 1957. Once there, his first steady work was with the Woody Herman Herd. From there he went on to join Buddy DeFranco. He recorded with many different jazz artists, including Benny Goodman, George Shearing, Cannonball Adderley and Miles Davis, most notably on Davis' 1963 album "Seven Steps to Heaven", the title tune being his own composition. The 5-CD Shelly Manne Black Hawk set, originally released on LP in September, 1959, is a good representation of Feldman's unmistakable driving "comping" behind the soloists, helping to define the session as a valuable hard bop genre element.
In 1957 Feldman settled in Los Angeles permanently and then specialized in lucrative session work for the US film and recording industry. He also branched out to work with a variety of musicians outside of jazz, working with artists such as Frank Zappa in 1967, Steely Dan and Joni Mitchell in the 1970s and Tom Waits and Joe Walsh in the 1980s. Feldman died at his home, aged 53, following a heart attack. In 2009, Feldman was inducted in the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN.

Streetcars in Washington, D.C.

For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region.
The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District. For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified. A bit later, the extensive mergers dubbed the "Great Streetcar Consolidation" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses. After a strike in 1955, the company changed ownership and became DC Transit, with explicit instructions to switch to buses. The system was dismantled in the early 1960s and the last streetcar ran on January 28, 1962.
Today streetcars, car barns, trackage, stations and right-of-way of the system still exist in various states of usage.
History.
Early transit in Washington.
Public transportation began in Washington, D.C. almost as soon as the city was founded. In May 1800, two-horse stage coaches began running twice daily from Bridge and High Streets NW (now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street NW) in Georgetown by way of M Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW/SE to William Tunnicliff's Tavern at the site now occupied by the Supreme Court Building. Service ended soon after it began.
The next attempt at public transit arrived in the spring of 1830, when Gilbert Vanderwerken's Omnibuses, horse-drawn wagons, began running from Georgetown to the Navy Yard. The company maintained stables on M Street, NW. These lines were later extended down 11th Street SE to the waterfront and up 7th Street NW to L Street NW. Vanderwerken's success attracted competitors, who added new lines, but by 1854, all omnibuses had come under the control of two companies, "The Union Line" and "The Citizen's Line." In 1860, these two merged under the control of Vanderwerken and continued to operate until they were run out of business by the next new technology: streetcars.
Horse-drawn streetcars.
Washington and Georgetown.
Streetcars began operation in New York City along the Bowery in 1832, but the technology did not really become popular until 1852, when Alphonse Loubat invented a side-bearing rail that could be laid flush with the street surface, allowing the first horse-drawn streetcar lines. The technology began to spread and on May 17, 1862, the first Washington, D.C. streetcar company, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad was incorporated.
The company ran the first streetcar in Washington D.C. from the Capitol to the State Department starting on July 29, 1862. It expanded to full operations from the Navy Yard to Georgetown on October 2, 1862. Another line opened on November 15, 1862. It was built along 7th Street NW from N Street NW to the Potomac River and expanded to the Arsenal (now Fort McNair) in 1875. A third line ran down 14th Street NW from Boundary Street NW (now Florida Avenue) to the Treasury Building. In 1863 the 7th Street line was extended north to Boundary Street NW.
Metropolitan.
The Washington and Georgetown's monopoly didn't last long. On July 1, 1864, a second streetcar company, the Metropolitan Railroad, was incorporated. It opened lines from the Capitol to the War Department along H Street NW. In 1872, it built a line on 9th Street NW and purchased the Union Railroad (chartered on January 19, 1872). It used the Union's charter to expand into Georgetown. In 1873 it purchased the Boundary and Silver Spring Railway (chartered on January 19, 1872) and used its charter to build north on what is now Georgia Avenue.
In June 1874, it absorbed the Connecticut Avenue and Park Railway (chartered on July 13, 1868; operations started in April 1873) and its line on Connecticut Avenue from the White House to Boundary Avenue.
By 1888, it had built additional lines down 4th Street NW/SW to P Street SW, and on East Capitol Street to 9th Street.
Columbia.
Chartered by Congress on May 24, 1870 and beginning operations the same year, the Columbia Railway was the city’s third horse car operator. It ran from the Treasury Building along H Street NW/NE to the city boundary at 15th Street NE. The company built a car barn and stable on the east side of 15th Street just south of H Street at the eastern end of the line.
Anacostia and Potomac River.
The Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad was chartered on May 5, 1870. It wasn't given approval by Congress until February 18, 1875, but it was constructed that year. The streetcars traveled from the Arsenal and crossed the Navy Yard Bridge to Uniontown (now Historic Anacostia) to Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Avenue) and V Street SE where a car barn and stables were maintained by the company. In 1888 the Anacostia and Potomac River expanded from the Navy Yard to Congressional Cemetery, and past Garfield Park to the Center Market (now the National Archives) in downtown. It also expanded up Nichols Avenue past the Government Hospital for the Insane (now St. Elizabeths Hospital).
Capitol, North O Street and South Washington.
The last streetcar company to begin operation during the horsecar era was the Capitol, North O Street and South Washington Railway. It was incorporated on March 3, 1875, and began operation later that year. It ran on a circular route around downtown D.C. A P Street NW track was added in 1876. In 1881, the route was extended north and south on 11th Street West and tracks were rerouted across the Mall. It changed its name to the Belt Railway on February 18, 1893.
Horse-drawn chariots and the Herdic Phaeton Company.
During this time, streetcars competed with numerous horse-drawn chariot companies. Starting on March 5, 1877, the date of President Hayes' inauguration, single-horse carriages began running on a route roughly parallel to the Washington and Georgetown's Pennsylvania Avenue route. After three years, streetcars forced the chariots out of business.
This was followed almost immediately by the Herdic Phaeton Company. The electric streetcar, however, was too much for the company to compete with and when its principal stockholder died in 1896, it ceased operations.
After the Herdic Company went under, the Metropolitan Coach Company began running horse-drawn coaches in conjunction with the Metropolitan Railroad, carrying passengers from 16th and T Streets NW to 22nd and G Streets NW. It began operations on May 1, 1897, with a car barn at 1914 E Street NW. In 1904, it became its own corporation.
The switch to electric power.
Horsecars, though an improvement over horse drawn wagons, were slow, dirty and inefficient. Horses needed to be housed and fed, created large amounts of waste, had difficulty climbing hills and were difficult to dispose of. Almost as soon as they were instituted, companies began looking for alternatives. For example, the Washington and Georgetown experimented with a steam motor car in the 1870s and 1880s which was run on Pennsylvania Avenue NW near the Capitol several times, but was never placed in permanent use.
In 1883, Frank Sprague an 1878 Naval Academy graduate, resigned from the Navy to work for
Thomas Edison. He wound up in Richmond, Virginia where, on February 2, 1888, he put into service the first electric-powered streetcar system. After 1888, many cities, including Washington, turned to electric-powered streetcars. To get electricity to the streetcars from the powerhouse where it was generated, an overhead wire was installed over city streets. A streetcar would touch this electric wire with a long pole (a "trolley" pole) on its roof. Back at the powerhouse, big steam engines would turn huge generators to produce the electricity needed to operate the streetcars. A new name was soon developed for streetcars powered by electricity in this manner; they were called trolley cars.
New electric streetcar companies.
Eckington and Soldiers' Home.
By 1888, Washington was expanding north of Boundary Street NW into the hills of Washington Heights and Petworth. Boundary Street was becoming such a misnomer that in 1890 it was renamed Florida Avenue. Climbing the hills to the new parts of the city was difficult for horses, but electric streetcars could do it easily. In the year following the successful demonstration of the Richmond streetcar, four electric streetcar companies were incorporated in Washington D.C. The Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway was the first to charter, on June 19, 1888, and started operation on October 17. Its tracks started at 7th Street and New York Avenue NW, east of Mount Vernon Square, and traveled 2.5 miles to the Eckington Car Barn at 4th and T Streets NE via Boundary Street NE, Eckington Place NE, R Street NE, 3rd Street NE and T Street NE. Another line ran up 4th Street NE to Michigan Avenue NE. A one-week pass cost $1.25. In 1889, the line was extended along T Street NE, 2nd Street NE and V Street NE to Glenwood Cemetery, but the extension proved unprofitable and was closed in 1894. At the same time, an extension was built along Michigan Avenue NE to the B&O railroad tracks. In 1895, the company removed its overhead trolley lines in accordance with its charter and attempted to replace them with batteries. These proved too costly and the company replaced them with horses in the central city. In 1896, Congress directed the Eckington and Soldier's Home to try compressed air motors and to substitute underground electric power for all its horse and overhead trolley lines in the city. The compressed-air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company switched to the standard underground electric power conduit.
Rock Creek.
The Rock Creek Railway was the second electric streetcar incorporated in D.C. It was incorporated in 1888 and started operations in 1890 on 2 blocks of Florida Avenue east of Connecticut Avenue. After completing a bridge over Rock Creek at Calvert Street on July 21, 1891, the line was extended through Adams Morgan and north on Connecticut Avenue to Chevy Chase Lake, Maryland. In 1893 a line was added through Cardozo/Shaw to 7th Street NW.
Georgetown and Tenleytown.
The third electric streetcar company to incorporate, the Georgetown and Tenleytown Railway, was chartered on August 22, 1888. In 1890, the railway started operations connecting Georgetown to the extant village of Tenleytown. The line traveled the length of the Georgetown and Rockville Road (now Wisconsin Avenue NW), stretching from the Potomac River to the Maryland state line. In 1890 it was extended across the Maryland line to Bethesda. In 1897, the Washington and Rockville Railway was formed to extend the line to Rockville. Though the two companies legally acted as different entities, they traveled identical routes on identical rails and shared a car barn (owned by WRECo) on Wisconsin Avenue NW at the District boundary. By 1900, the tracks had extended to Rockville.
Washington and Great Falls - Maryland and Washington.
Two more Washington D.C. streetcar companies operating in Maryland were incorporated by acts of Congress in the summer of 1892 (see: Streetcars in Washington, D.C. (Maryland)). The Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway was approved on July 28, 1892, to build an electric streetcar line from the Aqueduct Bridge to Cabin John Creek. It completed its track in August 1895. Because the railroad never reached Great Falls, but instead terminated at Cabin John, it was often referred to as the "Cabin John Trolley". The Maryland and Washington Railway was approved a few days later on August 1, 1892. It ran on Rhode Island Avenue NE from 4th Street NE reaching what is now Mount Rainier on the Maryland line in 1897. At its southern terminus it connected to the Eckington and Soldier's Home.
Capital Railway.
The first electric streetcar to operate in Anacostia was the Capital Railway. It was incorporated by Colonel Arthur Emmett Randle on March 2, 1895, to serve Congress Heights. It was to run from Shepherds Ferry along the Potomac and across the Navy Yard Bridge to M Street SE. A second line would run along Good Hope Road SE to the District boundary. The line was built during the Panic of 1896 despite 18 months of opposition from the Anacostia and Potomac River. In 1897 it experimented with the "Brown System", which used magnets in boxes to relay power instead of overhead or underground lines, and with double trolley lines over the Navy Yard Bridge. Both were failures. By 1898, the streetcar line ran along Nichols Avenue SE to Congress Heights, ending at Upsal Street SE. At the same time the Capital Railway was incorporated, the Washington and Marlboro Electric Railway was chartered to run trains across the Anacostia River through southeast Anacostia to the District boundary at Suitland Road and from there to Upper Marlboro, but it never laid any track.
Baltimore and Washington.
The Baltimore and Washington Transit Company was incorporated prior to 1894, with authorization to run from the District of Columbia, across Maryland to the Pennsylvania border. On June 8, 1896, it was given permission to enter the District of Columbia and connect to the spur of the Brightwood that ran on Butternut St NW. In 1897, it began construction on a line, known locally as the Dinky Line, that began at the end of the Brightwood spur at 4th and Butternut Streets NW, traveled south on 4th Street NW to Aspen Street NW and then east on Aspen Street NW and Laurel Street NW into Maryland. Later, between 1903 and 1917, a line was added running south on 3rd St NW and west on Kennedy St NW to Colorado Avenue where it connected to Capital Traction's 14th Street line. On March 14, 1914, it changed its name to the Washington and Maryland Railway.
East Washington Heights.
The East Washington Heights Traction Railroad was incorporated on June 18, 1898. By 1903 it ran from the Capitol along Pennsylvania Avenue SE to Barney Circle, and by 1908, it went across the bridge to Randle Highlands (now known as Twining) as far as 27th St SE. By 1917 it had been extended out Pennsylvania Avenue past 33rd Street SE.
Washington, Spa Spring, and Gretta.
The last new streetcar company to form was the Washington, Spa Spring and Gretta Railroad. It was chartered by the state of Maryland on February 13, 1905, and authorized to enter the District on February 18, 1907. Construction began by March 22, 1908.
In 1910, it began running cars along a single track from a modest waiting station and car barn near 15th Street NE and H Street NE along Bladensburg Road NE to Bladensburg. July 5, 1892, the District of Columbia Suburban Railway was incorporated to run streetcars along the same route - on Bladensburg Road NE from the Columbia tracks on H Street NE to the Maryland line and from Brookland to Florida Avenue NE, but it was never constructed. Although initially planned to go as far as Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the line never ran further than an extension to Berwyn Heights, Maryland. The route was planned to promote development of company-owned land adjacent to the tracks, but it never successfully competed with established rail lines in the same area. Noting its diminished ambitions, it became the Washington Interurban Railway on October 12, 1912, and changed the Railway to Railroad in 1919.
Conversion of horse cars to mechanical and electrical power.
On March 2, 1889, the District authorized every streetcar company in Washington to switch from horse power to underground cable or to electricity provided by battery or underground wire and in 1890 companies were authorized to sell stock to pay for the upgrades - provided they did not involve overhead wires. In 1892, one-horse cars were banned within the city, and by 1894 Congress began requiring companies to switch to something other than horse power while continuing to disallow overhead lines within the city.
Washington and Georgetown.
After the March 2, 1889, law passed, the Washington and Georgetown began installing an underground cable system. Their 7th Street line switched to cable car on April 12, 1890. The rest of the system switched to cable by August 18, 1892. In 1892, they extended their track along 14th to Park Road NW.
Brightwood.
On October 18, 1888, the day after the Eckington and Soldier's Home began operation, Congress authorized the Brightwood Railway to electrify the Metropolitan's streetcar line on Seventh Street Extended NW or Brightwood Avenue NW (now known as Georgia Avenue NW) and to extend it to the District boundary at Silver Spring. In 1890 they bought the former Boundary and Silver Spring line from the Metropolitan, but continued to operate it as a horse line. In 1892 it was ordered by Congress to switch to overhead electrical power and complete the line. The next year, the streetcar tracks reached Takoma Park via a spur along Butternut Street NW to 4th Street NW. In 1898, the Brightwood was ordered to switch to underground electric power on pain of having its charter revoked.
Metropolitan.
The Metropolitan experimented with batteries in 1890 but found them unsatisfactory. On August 2, 1894, Congress ordered the Metropolitan to switch to underground electrical power. It complied, installing the underground sliding shoe on the north-south line in January 1895. The Metropolitan switched the rest of the system to electric power on July 7, 1896 In 1895, the Metropolitan built a streetcar barn near the Arsenal and a loop in Georgetown to connect it to the Georgetown Car Barn. In 1896 it extended service along East Capitol Street and built the East Capitol Street Car Barn, ( photo); and extended its service to Mount Pleasant.
Columbia.
The Columbia decided to try a cable system, the last cable car system built in the United States. They built a new cable car barn and began operating the system on March 9, 1895. It became clear that the underground electrical system was superior, so it quickly abandoned cable cars and switched to electrical power on July 22, 1899. The last cable car in the city ran the next day.
Using electricity from the power plant built to power its cable operation, the Columbia won permission in 1898 to build a line east along Benning Road NE, splitting on the east side of the Anacostia. One branch ran to Kenilworth, and the other connected at Seat Pleasant with the terminus of the steam-powered Chesapeake Beach Railway.
Belt.
In 1896 the Belt Railway tried out compressed air motors. The compressed air motors were a failure, and in 1899 the cars were equipped with the standard underground power system.
Anacostia and Potomac River.
The Anacostia and Potomac River switched from horses to electricity in April 1900. This was the last horse-drawn streetcar to run in the District.
Virginia trolleys operating in Washington, D.C..
Two electric trolley companies serving Northern Virginia also operated in the District and a third received permission to do so, but never did so (see: Northern Virginia trolleys):
The Washington & Arlington Railway was the first Virginia company given permission to operate in Washington. It was incorporated on February 28, 1892, with the right to run a streetcar from the train station at 6th Street NW and B Street NW to Virginia across a new Three Sisters Bridge. It was also allotted space in the Georgetown Car Barn. The company was never able to construct the new bridge, and so never operated in Washington.
The Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway began operating between Alexandria and Mount Vernon in 1892. On August 23, 1894, it was given permission to enter the District of Columbia using a boat or barge. However, the railroad never actually used any such watercraft.
The railroad completed its tracks in 1896 and began serving a waiting station at 14th Street NW and B Street NW. From the waiting station it used the Belt Line Street Railway Company's tracks on 14th Street NW to reach the Long Bridge, a combined road and rail crossing of the Potomac River. In 1906, the Long Bridge's road and streetcar tracks were relocated to a new truss bridge (the Highway Bridge), immediately west of the older bridge. This span was removed in 1967.
In 1902, the railroad moved its station, as the Belt Line's tracks were circling the block containing the site of a planned new District Building (now the John A. Wilson Building). The new station (address: 1204 N. Pennsylvania Avenue) extended along 12th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to D Street NW, near the site of the present Federal Triangle Metro station and on the opposite side of 12th Street from the Post Office building.
On October 17, 1910, the Washington and Arlington, by then the Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad, and the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon merged to form the Washington–Virginia Railway. The company had difficulty competing and in 1924 declared bankruptcy. In 1927 the two companies were split and sold at auction. The former Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railroad reemerged as the Arlington and Fairfax Railway and continued to serve the city on the Washington-Virginia route until January 17, 1932, when the Mt. Vernon Memorial Highway (now the George Washington Memorial Parkway) opened. The Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad was chartered January 24, 1900, and authorized to enter the District on January 29, 1903. It crossed over the Aqueduct Bridge and terminated at a station immediately west of the Georgetown Car Barn. In 1912, it was incorporated into the new Washington and Old Dominion Railway and became the Great Falls Division of that company.
The Great Streetcar Consolidation.
By the mid-1890s, there were numerous streetcar companies operating in the District. Congress tried to deal with this fractured transit system by requiring them to accept transfers, set standard pricing and by allowing them to use one another's track. But eventually, lawmakers settled on consolidation as the best solution.
On March 1, 1895, Congress authorized the Rock Creek to purchase the Washington and Georgetown on Sept. 21, producing the Capital Traction Company. In 1916 Capital Traction took ownership of the Washington and Maryland and its 2.591 miles of track.
After Capital Traction's powerhouse at 14th and E NW burned down on September 29, 1897, the company replaced the cable cars with an electric system. The 14th Street branch switched to electric power on February 27, 1898, the Pennsylvania Avenue division on April 20, 1898, and the 7th Street branch on May 26, 1898.
The Anacostia and Potomac River began expanding on June 24, 1898, by purchasing the Belt Railway; the next year, it bought the Capital Railway.
Later that year, the Eckington and Soldier's Home purchased the Maryland and Washington. On June 27, 1898, the new, combined company changed its name to the City and Suburban Railway of Washington. Later that year, it bought the Columbia and Maryland Railway, which ran from Mount Rainier to Laurel.
Between 1896 and 1899, three businessmen purchased controlling interests in the Metropolitan; the Columbia; the Anacostia and Potomac River; the Georgetown and Tennallytown; the Washington, Woodside and Forest Glen; the Washington and Great Falls; and the Washington and Rockville railway companies, in addition to the Potomac Electric Power Company and the United States Electric Lighting Company. They incorporated the Washington Traction and Electric Company on June 5, 1899, as a holding company for these interests. But the holding company had borrowed too heavily and paid too much for the subsidiaries and quickly landed in financial trouble. To prevent transit disruption, Congress on June 5, 1900, authorized the Washington and Great Falls to acquire the stock of any and all of the railways and power companies owned by Washington Traction. When Washington Traction defaulted on its loans on June 1, 1901, Washington and Great Falls moved in to take its place. On February 4, 1902, Washington and Great Falls changed its named to the Washington Railway and Electric Company, reincorporated as a holding company and exchanged stock in Washington Traction and Electric one for one for stock in the new company (at a discounted rate).
Not every company became a part of Washington Railway immediately. The City and Suburban and the Georgetown and Tennallytown operated as subsidiaries of Washington Railway until October 31, 1926, when it purchased the remainder of their stock.
In 1908, the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway began service from Washington to Baltimore and Annapolis. Though technically an interurban, this railway utilized streetcar tracks from its terminal at 15th and H Streets NE and across the Benning Road Bridge where it switched to its own tracks in Deanwood. It was the main source of transportation to Suburban Gardens, known as "the black Glen Echo", the first and only major amusement park within Washington.
The next major consolidation occurred on August 31, 1912, when the Washington Railway purchased the controlling stock of the Anacostia and Potomac River. This left only 6 companies operating in Washington - four of which had less than 3 miles of track. It also led to Congress passing the "Anti-Merger Act", prohibiting mergers without Congress' approval and establishing the Public Utilities Commission. In 1914 a failed attempt was made to have the Federal Government purchase all of the streetcar lines and companies.
Streetcars were unionized in 1916 when local 689 of the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America won recognition after a three-day strike.
Further consolidation came in the form of the North American Company, a transit and public utility holding company. North American began to acquire stock in Washington Railway in 1922, gaining a controlling interest by 1928. By December 31, 1933, it owned 50.016% of the voting stock. North American tried to purchase Capital Traction, but never owned more than 2.5% of Capital Traction stock.
Bustitution and competition.
By 1916 streetcar use was reaching its peak in Washington, D.C. The combined systems had over 200 miles of track, with almost 100 in the city. Passengers could travel to Great Falls, Glen Echo, Rockville, Kensington and Laurel in Maryland; and to Mount Vernon, Alexandria, Vienna, Fairfax, Leesburg, Great Falls and Bluemont in Virginia. World War I saw further increases in passenger traffic. But the streetcars were also under increasing threat from competition.
The first threat to the streetcars came with the introduction of gasoline powered taxicabs. The taximeter, invented in 1891, combined with the combustion engine, created a new form of public transportation. Taxicabs were put into service in Paris in 1899, in New York in 1907 and in Washington in 1908. Over the years, their numbers expanded.
In 1909 the Metropolitan Coach Company began to switch from horse-drawn coaches to gasoline-powered coaches - replacing its entire system by 1913 - becoming a precursor to the bus companies. It was a financial failure though and on August 13, 1915, the company ceased operations.
The gasoline-powered bus was invented in Germany in 1895 and motorized buses were introduced in New York City in 1905. As improvements, such as balloon tires, were made, buses became more popular. The first formal bus company in Washington, the Washington Rapid Transit Company, was incorporated on January 20, 1921. By 1932 it was carrying 4.5% of transit customers. Two years later, the last streetcar line was built.
Just as the horse cars had replaced carriages and the electric streetcar replaced horse cars, so too were buses to replace the electric streetcars.
In 1923, the number of streetcar companies operating in Washington cut in half as three companies switched to buses. The East Washington Heights became the first streetcar company to switch, replacing its two streetcars and one mile of track with a bus line. The Washington Interurban switched next and its tracks were removed when Bladensburg Road was repaved. In that same year, the Key Bridge was constructed and, as a result, the Washington and Old Dominion gave up rail access to D.C. in exchange for a terminal in Rosslyn.
When electric streetcars began, several lines also delivered freight on rail cars running on their lines. Capital Traction abandoned this service in 1931.
In 1932, the Arlington and Fairfax Motor Transportation Company was established to replace the streetcar service of the Arlington and Fairfax which lost the right to use the Highway Bridge. The last Arlington and Fairfax streetcar departed from 12th Street NW and D Street NW, on January 17, 1932, abandoning all streetcar service in the city.
In the summer of 1935 - after consolidation, several major lines were converted from streetcars to buses. The line from Friendship Heights to Rockville (formerly the Washington and Rockville), the P Street line (Metropolitan), the Anacostia-Congress Heights line (Capital Railway) and the Connecticut Avenue line in Chevy Chase (Rock Creek) were all replaced with buses. At the same time, the Chesapeake Beach Railway and the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis interurban ceased operations. The rail of the WB&A become the property of Capital Transit.
With further bustitution, the Columbia Railway Company Car Barn was converted to a bus barn in 1942.
Monopoly.
On December 1, 1933, Washington Railway, Capital Traction, and Washington Rapid Transit merged to form the Capital Transit Company. Washington Railway continued as a holding company, owning 50% of Capital Transit and 100% of PEPCO, but Capital Traction was dissolved. For the first time, street railways in Washington were under the management of one company.
Capital Transit made several changes. As part of the merger, the Capital Traction generating plant in Georgetown was closed (and, in 1943, decommissioned) and Capital Transit used only conventionally supplied electric power. In 1935, it closed several lines and replaced them with bus service. Because the Rockville line in Maryland was one of the lines that was closed, the Capital Transit Community Terminal was opened at Wisconsin Avenue NW and Western Avenue NW on August 4, 1935. At the same time, the car barn on the west side of Wisconsin at Ingomar was razed and replaced with the Western Bus Garage. In 1936, the system introduced route numbers. On August 28, 1937, the first PCC streetcars began running on 14th Street NW. By early 1946, the company would place in service 489 of the streamlined, modern PCC model and, in the early 1950s, become the first in the nation to have an all-PCC fleet. (Here's a General Electric ad about PCC cars in Washington.)
During the 1930s, city newspapers began pushing for streetcar tunneling. The Capitol Subway was built in 1906 and three years later, the Washington Post called for a citywide subway to be built. Nothing happened until Capital Transit took over. The full $35 million plan to depress streets as trenches for exclusive streetcar use never materialized, but in 1942 an underground loop terminal was built at 14th and C Streets SW under the Bureau of Engraving and on December 14, 1949, the Connecticut Avenue subway tunnel under Dupont Circle, running from N Street to R Street, was opened.
At first, business was good for the new company. During World War II, gasoline rationing limited automobile use, but transit companies were exempt from the rationing. Meanwhile, wage freezes held labor costs in check. With increased revenue and steady costs, Capital Transit conservatively built up a $7 million cash reserve. In 1945 Capital Transit had America’s 3rd largest streetcar fleet. (A map of the system in 1948)
In 1946 in a decision by the United States Supreme Court in "North American Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission", the Supreme Court upheld the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and forced North American, because it also owned the Potomac Electric Power Co., to sell its shares of Capital Transit. Buyers were hard to come by, but on September 12, 1949, Louis Wolfson and his three brothers purchased from North American 46.5% of the company's stock for $20 per share and the Washington Railway was dissolved. For $2.2 million they bought a company with $7 million in cash. The Wolfsons began paying themselves huge dividends until, in 1955, the war chest was down to $2.7 million. During the same period, transit trips dropped by 40,000 trips per day and automobile ownership doubled.
On December 29, 1954, Capital Transit lost one of its last freight customers when the East Washington Railway took over the delivery of coal from the B&O to the PEPCO power plant at Benning. Previously this had been done using Capital Transit's steeple-cab electric locomotives operating over a remnant of the Benning car line.
DC Transit.
In January 1955 the Capital Transit Company, then consisting of 750 buses and 450 streetcars, sought permission for a fare increase, but was denied. So that spring, when employees asked for a raise, there was no money available and the company refused to increase pay. Frustrated, employees went on strike on July 1, 1955. The strike, only the third in D.C. history and the first since a three-day strike in 1945, lasted for seven weeks. Commuters were forced to hitch rides and walk in the brutal summer heat.
On July 18, 1956, after Wolfson dared the Senate to revoke his franchise claiming no other entrepreneur would take the company on, the Congress did just that. Months later, the franchise was sold to O. Roy Chalk, a New York financier who owned controlling interest in Trans Caribbean Airways, for $13.5 million. The company's name was then changed to DC Transit.
Abandonment.
As part of the deal selling Capital Transit to O. Roy Chalk, he was required to replace the system with buses by 1963. Chalk fought the retirement of the streetcars but was unsuccessful, and the final abandonment of the streetcar system began on September 7, 1958, with the end of the North Capitol Street (Route 80) and Maryland (Route 82) lines. On January 3, 1960, the Glen Echo (Route 20), Friendship Heights (Route 30) & Georgia Avenue (Routes 70, 72, 74) streetcar lines were abandoned and the Southern Division (Maine Avenue) Car Barn was closed. This technically ended "trolley" cars in D.C. as only conduit operations remained. On December 3, 1961, the streetcar lines to Mount Pleasant (Routes 40, 42) and 11th Street (Route 60) were abandoned.
The remaining system, including lines to the Navy Yard, the Colorado Avenue terminal, and the Bureau of Engraving (Routes 50, 54) and to the Calvert Street Loop, Barney Circle, and Union Station (Routes 90, 92) was shut down in January 1962. Early on the morning of Sunday, January 28, 1962, preceded by cars 1101 and 1053, car 766 entered the Navy Yard Car Barn for the last time, and Washington's streetcars became history.
Remnants.
Streetcars.
About 20 streetcars remain of the hundreds that once plied the streets of Washington.
Only one, Capital Transit 1551, is still in daily transit use. One of the 15 sold to Fort Worth, it was repainted and transferred to the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority in 2002 where it provides part-time regular streetcar service along the streets of Dallas.
One other car remains in intermittent use: a Capital Transit PCC car sold to Sarajevo that has been restored and operates in charter service in Sarajevo.
Others serve as museum pieces. The only Washington streetcar still in the District is Capital Traction 303 which serves as an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Washington and Georgetown 212 is also preserved by the Smithsonian, but stored in the Smithsonian's facility in Suitland, Maryland. Seven more, including D.C. Transit 1101 and 1540, Capital Transit 509, 522, 766 and 1430, and Washington Railway 650, are preserved at the National Capital Trolley Museum in the Washington suburbs. Three other cars owned by the Trolley Museum were destroyed in a fire on September 28, 2003. Farther from D.C., D.C. Transit 1470 is kept at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia, Capital Transit 09 is at Rockhill Trolley Museum in Rockhill Furnace, Pennsylvania, Capital Transit 010 is maintained at the Connecticut Trolley Museum and D.C. Transit 1304 is kept at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. Three of the Ft. Worth cars are held in storage by North Texas Historic Transportation with plans to place them in a yet-to-be-built museum. Finally, two of the Barcelona cars are privately owned and stored in Madrid, Spain, and Ejea de los Caballeros, Spain, and another two are in the Museu del Transport in Castellar de n'Hug, Spain (Photo of one).
Tracks.
Much of the track in D.C. was removed and sold for scrap. The complex trackwork on Capitol Plaza in front of Washington Union Station was removed in the mid-1960s. The Pennsylvania Avenue NW trackwork between the Capitol and the Treasury Building was removed during the street's mid-1980s redevelopment.
Elsewhere, the track was buried under pavement. The loop tracks of the former Capitol Transit connection, behind the closed restaurant on Calvert Street NW, immediately east of the Duke Ellington Bridge, are extant under asphalt. The tracks on Florida Avenue also exist under pavement (as shown by the eternal seam above the conduit). Tracks also exist under Ellington Place NE, 3rd Street NE, 8th Street SE, and elsewhere.
The region's only remaining visible tracks and conduit are in the center of the cobblestone 3400 through 3800 blocks of P Street NW and O Street NW in Georgetown.
Car barns and shops.
Some car barns, or car houses as they were later known, survived in part or in whole.
Other car barns were demolished.
Stations and loops.
A few stations and terminals have survived. Sometime after conversion of the Mt. Pleasant Line in December 1961, the Dupont Circle streetcar stations were used as a civil defense storage area for a few years and then left empty again. The space was once considered for a columbarium. In 1993 one of the stations was opened as a food court called DuPont Down Under, but after only 18 months it closed and the space has been vacant ever since. In 2007, D.C. Council member Jim Graham began consideration of a suggestion to allow adult-themed clubs to move into the property. It is now an outpost for the D.C. Police Department.
The Colorado Avenue Terminal on 14th Street NW is still in use as a Metrobus stop and the Calvert Street loop just east of the Duke Ellington Bridge is still used as a Metrobus turnaround loop.
There was a streetcar station in the center of Barney Circle but it was removed in the 1970s.
The streetcar turnaround at 11th and Monroe NW is now the 11th and Monroe Streets Park.
Tunnels.
The Dupont Circle streetcar station tunnel entrances, located where the tree-filled medians of Connecticut Avenue NW now stand north of N Street NW and between R Street NW and S Street NW, were filled in and paved over in August 1964, leaving only the traffic tunnel.
The C Street NW/NE tunnel beneath the Upper Senate Park remained in use as a one-way service road adjacent to the Capitol, but since 9/11 it has been closed to the public.
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing underground loop is now part of a parking structure and storage area that is located directly underneath 14th Street SW. Tracks can still be seen in the floors in some locations of the Bureau.
Right-of-way.
The right-of-way of the Glen Echo line is extant from the Georgetown Car Barn all the way to the Dalecarlia Reservoir filtration plant. It includes an abutment near an entrance to Georgetown University, a trestle over Foundry Branch in Glover Archibald Park, and the median of Sherier Place NW from Cathedral Avenue NW to Manning Place NW. Part of the right-of-way on the Georgetown campus was removed in the spring of 2007 to create a turning lane off of Canal Road NW. A trestle over Clark Place NW, adjacent to Canal Road, was also removed after the Cabin John line was abandoned.
The wide median of Pennsylvania Avenue SE from the Capitol to Barney Circle was built in 1903 to serve as a streetcar right of way. It now serves as urban greenspace.
Other remnants.
Perhaps the most visible remnant of the streetcar system is the Metrobus system, run by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). On January 14, 1973, WMATA purchased DC Transit and the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company (followed on February 4 by the purchase of AB&W Transit Company and WMA Transit Company) unifying all the bus companies in D.C. of today's WMATA's bus routes are only marginally changed from the streetcar lines they followed. For example, the #30 streetcar route that ran from Barney Circle to Friendship Heights is now the #30 bus line that runs from Anacostia through Barney Circle to Friendship Heights.
Still other remnants include the Potomac Electric Power Company, the electric portion of Washington Traction and Electric Company, which remains the D.C. area's primary electrical power company; some streetcar-related manhole covers that remain in use around town; and two trolley poles for Capital Traction's overhead wires on the Connecticut Avenue Bridge over Klingle Valley in Cleveland Park. The poles likely date back to the bridge's construction in 1931.

CKCY (AM)

CKCY was a Canadian radio station, which signed on May 25, 1955 and broadcast until August 30, 1992 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.
The station was originally launched by Algonquin Radio, a local business consortium led by Carmen Greco, with a 250 watt signal at 1400 on the AM dial. In 1961, the station moved to 920 AM, and increased its signal to 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts nighttime. In 1965, Algonquin launched CKCY-FM. In the early 1970s, Harry Wolfe, the play-by-play voice of the Ontario Hockey League's Sault Greyhounds, hosted a daily call-in talk show called "Open Mike". By then, CKCY had become the principal Top 40 music station in the Twin Saults.
Among the station's alumni is current Hamilton City Councillor Bob Bratina.
In 1976, the stations were acquired by Huron Broadcasting, who also launched CKCY-TV in 1978. Huron subsequently sold the radio stations to a new business consortium, CKCY 920 Ltd., in 1985. That group subsequently sold them to Mid-Canada Radio in 1988, and Mid-Canada in turn was acquired by the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990.
In 1984, CKCY received CRTC approval to move from 920 kHz to 540 kHz. The change to AM 540 was never implemented. CKCY remained at AM 920 until its permanent sign-off in 1992.
Due to the economic circumstances of the Sault Ste. Marie market, with competition from stations in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan severely curtailing the profitability of the Ontario stations, Pelmorex shut down the AM station in 1992. The FM station is still operating as CJQM-FM.
The final song to be played by CKCY was Sweeney Todd's 1975 single "Roxy Roller" at approximately 11:56 pm on August 30, 1992. Once the song was completed, an automated, repeating farewell message was broadcast past midnight and continued for several days. The actual date when CKCY ceased transmitting is not known.

<doc id="2844806" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844806" title="Gnash">
Gnash

Gnash is a media player for playing SWF files. Gnash is available both as a standalone player for desktop computers and embedded devices, as well as a plugin for several browsers. It is part of the GNU Project and is a free and open-source alternative to Adobe Flash Player. It was developed from the GameSWF project.
Gnash was first announced in late 2005 by software developer John Gilmore. The current maintainer is Rob Savoye.
History.
Writing a free software Flash player has been a priority of the GNU Project for some time. Prior to the launch of Gnash, the GNU Project had asked for people to assist the GPLFlash project. The majority of the previous GPLFlash developers have now moved to the Gnash project and the existing GPLFlash codebase will be refocused towards supporting embedded systems.
The primary distribution terms for Gnash are those of the GNU GPL. However since Gnash was started using the codebase of the GameSWF project, which is in the public domain, code developed by the Gnash project which might be useful in GameSWF is placed in the public domain.
Technical details.
Architecture.
Adobe only provides an outdated version (11.2) of its official player for Linux on IA-32 and an AMD64 developer preview release in a binary-only form. Gnash, however, can be compiled and executed on many architectures, including x86, ARM, IRIX, and PowerPC. It also supports BSD-based operating systems. An early port for RISC OS, which has never had Macromedia/Adobe Flash support beyond Flash 3, does exist, as well as an early port for BeOS, where Flash support terminated at Version 4. Development of a port to AmigaOS 4.1 has also recently begun. A port to the Haiku Operating System also exists.
Gnash requires one of AGG, Cairo, or OpenGL for rendering. In contrast to most GNU projects, which are typically written in C, Gnash is written in the C++ programming language because of its GameSWF heritage.
Flash compatibility.
Currently, Gnash can play SWF files up to version 7, and 80% of ActionScript 2.0.
The goal of the Gnash developers is to be as compatible as possible with the proprietary player (including behavior on bad ActionScript code). However, Gnash offers some special features not available in the Adobe player, such as the possibility to extend the ActionScript classes via shared libraries: sample extensions include MySQL support, file system access and more. For security reasons the extension mechanism must be compiled-in explicitly and enabled via configuration files.
Video support.
Gnash supports playback of FLV videos and allows playing some FLV files from YouTube, Myspace, ShowMeDo and other similar websites (older files with sound – newer files without playing sound). FLV support requires FFmpeg or GStreamer to be installed on the system.
Some other free-software programs, such as MPlayer, VLC media player or players for Windows based on the ffdshow DirectShow codecs can play back the FLV format if the file is specially downloaded or piped to it.
The version 0.8.8 was released on the 22 August 2010. Rob Savoye announced that Gnash should now work with 100% of all YouTube videos. Version 0.8.8 has GPU support, which pushed it ahead of the proprietary Adobe Flash Player in Linux, until Flash 10.2 came out with hardware acceleration built in. Gnash still suffers from high CPU usage. A Flashblock plugin can be installed by the user, turning on the Flash support on a case-by-case, as needed basis. YouTube video controls and full screen mode is functioning, although version 0.8.8 has a bug that can cause YouTube to display "Invalid parameters". Many popular Flash games do not work with Gnash 0.8.8.
Commercial support.
The project was financially supported by a commercial company, Lulu.com until July 2010.
Adobe Flash Player End-User License Agreement.
One problem for the project is the difficulty of finding developers. The current developers have never installed Adobe's Flash player, because they fear that anyone who has ever installed the Adobe Flash Player has at the same time accepted an agreement not to modify or reverse engineer Flash player. Therefore, the Gnash project has only about 6 active developers.
Such generic clauses, however, may be against national anticompetition laws when used in normal software license agreements. On May 2, 2012, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in case C-406/10 of SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd that the functionality of a computer program is not protected by copyright in the European Union and that contractual provisions are null and void if they forbid observing, studying and testing a computer program in order to reproduce its behavior in a second program. This holds as long as no source code or object code was copied.
Windows support.
Gnash has been ported to Windows and the plugin works best with Firefox 1.0.4 or newer, and should work in any Mozilla-based browser. However, in newer browsers the plugin may become unstable or inoperative.
Newer Gnash binaries for Windows do not include a plugin and currently there is no newer working Gnash plugin on Windows.

Ron Washington

Ronald Washington (born April 29, 1952) is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and the current manager of the Texas Rangers. Prior to managing the Rangers, Washington coached in the New York Mets and Oakland Athletics organizations.
Playing career.
Washington was signed by the Kansas City Royals on July 17, 1970. He spent the next ten seasons in the minor leagues with three different organizations (Royals, Mets, and Dodgers). He earned a brief September callup with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 hitting .368 (7 for 19). He wouldn't return to the major league level until 1981 with the Minnesota Twins where he would remain until 1986. He then played one season each for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, and Houston Astros before retiring from Triple-A Oklahoma City in 1990. He was a middle infielder for most of his career. On May 28, 1988, while playing for the Indians, Washington broke up Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Odell Jones' no-hit bid after 8 and 1/3 innings with a pinch-hit single.
Coaching career.
Following his retirement as a player, Washington worked in the New York Mets organization for five years. After being hired as the Oakland Athletics first base coach in 1996 under his former Astros manager Art Howe, Washington then served as infield and third base coach for the A's between 1997 and 2006. As infield coach Washington has been credited for developing much of the A's young infield talent in the last decade, including six-time Gold Glover Eric Chavez, and former MVP and A's shortstop Miguel Tejada. In 2004, Chavez expressed his appreciation by giving Washington one of his Gold Glove trophies, signed "Wash, not without you." 
Washington plays a significant role in the events of the book "Moneyball", a book detailing how the A's have been successful despite a small budget. Washington is shown in a positive light for the way he trained Scott Hatteberg to field first base for the first time in his career. Washington is also, however, portrayed as too old-fashioned and traditional in his lack of acceptance of general manager Billy Beane's sabermetric strategies. He was portrayed in the film adaptation of the book by Brent Jennings.
Manager.
On November 6, 2006, the Texas Rangers announced that Washington had accepted their offer to manage the team replacing Buck Showalter, who was fired a month earlier. Washington beat out four other candidates for the job: Rangers bench coach Don Wakamatsu, then New York Mets third base coach Manny Acta, Nippon Ham Fighters manager Trey Hillman and former Rangers catcher John Russell.
At the beginning of the 2007 season, it was rumored that there was a rift between Washington and Rangers star Mark Teixeira. Asked about it, Washington responded,
Teixeira was traded to the Atlanta Braves in July 2007 and had been rumored to have been on the trading block before reports of tensions with Washington, as his agent, Scott Boras, had refused to negotiate a contract extension beyond the 2008 season. Reports also suggested tensions between Washington and catcher Gerald Laird. Questioned about the rumors, Washington conceded that the pressure he put on Laird was "a lot to put on a young kid... (But) that's what we've got. He's got to grow up fast."
On August 6, 2007, Washington was ejected for the first time of his managerial career after arguing with umpire Bill Miller over a called third strike to Michael Young, who also was ejected. On March 17, 2010, Jon Heyman of "Sports Illustrated" reported that Washington tested positive for cocaine during the 2009 season and has admitted to using cocaine.
Washington would become only the second manager of the Rangers franchise, after Johnny Oates, to take his team to the post-season after winning the AL West in 2010; the team's first division title in 11 years. On October 12, 2010, Washington became the first manager in franchise history to win a playoff series, with a 3–2 victory in the ALDS over the Tampa Bay Rays. On October 22, 2010, Washington's Rangers defeated the New York Yankees in the ALCS in six games, to advance to their first World Series in franchise history, before losing to the San Francisco Giants in five games. He also became the third African American to manage a team into a World Series, joining Cito Gaston, who managed the Toronto Blue Jays to the World Championship in the 1992 and 1993 World Series, and Dusty Baker, who managed the Giants in the 2002 World Series.
Referring to Washington, second baseman Ian Kinsler said: ""I just love the way he never holds his emotion back, especially when he's managing. He hangs on every pitch, and it's great to know that your manager is in every single pitch and cares that much."" In 2009 his salary was about $750,000. On November 4, 2010, Washington agreed to a two-year contract extension.
On October 15, 2011, Washington managed the Rangers to their second World Series in as many years, when the Rangers defeated the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS. The Rangers eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in 7 games, after twice being one strike away from the title in game 6. On January 30, 2012, Washington agreed to another two-year contract extension. He managed the American League in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game.
On September 2, 2012, Washington earned his 507th win as a manager of the Texas Rangers, passing Johnny Oates for 2nd most wins by a Rangers manager. On August 4, 2013, Washington passed Bobby Valentine for the most wins as a Rangers manager, at 582.

Slapshot (mascot)

Slapshot is the official mascot for the Washington Capitals of the NHL.
Biography.
Slapshot was unveiled on November 17, 1995. He is a large bald eagle who wears the number 00. He was first introduced to home fans by Stephanie Williams, a 5th Grader from Fairfax Station, VA who won a naming contest for the new mascot.
Slapshot can be seen at every home game and is frequently joined by secondary mascots, Air Slapshot and Hat Trick. He makes hundreds of appearance each year in the Maryland, Virginia and DC region soaring into charity fundraisers, community festivals and parades. He has also performed across the country and was recently seen on The Price is Right. 
Slapshot often dons different costumes, such as Santa during the holidays and as the President to commemorate when the Washington Capitals won the Presidents' Trophy.

<doc id="2844876" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844876" title="Stadiametric rangefinding">
Stadiametric rangefinding

Stadiametric rangefinding, or the stadia method is a technique of measuring distances with a telescopic instrument. The term stadia comes from a Greek unit of length. Stadiametric rangefinding is used for surveying and in the telescopic sights of firearms, artillery pieces, or tank guns, as well as some binoculars and other optics. It is still widely used in long-range military sniping, but in many professional applications it is being replaced with microwave, infrared, or laser rangefinding methods. Although much easier to use, electronic rangefinders can give away the shooter's position to a well-equipped adversary, and the need for accurate range estimation existed for much longer than electronic rangefinders small and rugged enough to be suitable for military use.
Principle.
The stadia method is based upon the principle that in similar triangles homologous sides are proportional. This means that, for a right triangle with a given angle, the ratio of adjacent side length to opposite side length (see tangent) is constant. By using a reticle with marks of a known angular spacing, the principle of similar triangles can be used to find either the distance to objects of known size or the size of objects at a known distance. In either case, the known parameter is used, in conjunction with the angular measurement, to derive the length of the other side.
Since a radian is defined as the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals the radius of the circle, a milliradian (sometimes called a mil), is the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals 1/1000 of the radius of the circle. An object 5 meters high, for example, will cover 1 mrad at 5000 meters, or 5 mrad at 1000 meters, or 25 mrad at 200 meters. Since the radian expresses a ratio, it is independent of the units used; an object 6 feet high covering 1 mrad will be 6000 feet distant.
Surveying.
Stadia readings used in surveying can be taken with modern instruments such as transits, theodolites, plane-table alidades and levels. When using the stadia measuring method, a "stadia rod" is held so that it appears between two "stadia marks" visible on the instrument's reticle. The stadia rod has measurements written on it that can be read through the telescope of the instrument, providing a known length for the distance calculations.
An instrument equipped for stadia work has two horizontal stadia marks spaced equidistant from the center crosshair of the reticle. The interval between stadia marks in most stadia instruments gives a "stadia interval factor" of 100. The distance between the instrument and a stadia rod can be determined simply by multiplying the measurement between the stadia hairs (known as the stadia interval) by 100. 
The instrument must be level for this method to work directly. If the instrument line of sight is inclined, the horizontal and vertical distance components must be determined. Some instruments have additional graduations on a vertical circle to assist with these inclined measurements. These graduated circles, known as "stadia circles", provide the value of the horizontal and the vertical measurements as a percentage of the direct stadia measurement.
This system is sufficiently precise for locating topographic details such as rivers, bridges, buildings, and roads when an accuracy of 1/400 is acceptable. 
The stadia method of distance measurement is primarily historical for surveying purposes, as distance nowadays is invariably measured by electronic or taping methods. Total station instruments do not have stadia lines marked on the reticle. Traditional methods are still used in areas where modern instruments are not common or by practitioners whose primary task is not surveying with sophisticated instruments.

Leveraged lease

A leveraged lease a lease in which the lessor puts up some of the money required to purchase the asset and borrows the rest from a lender. The lender is given a senior secured interest on the asset and an assignment of the lease and lease payments. The lessee makes payments to the lessor, who makes payments to the lender. 
The term may also refer to a lease agreement wherein the lessor, by borrowing funds from a lending institution, finances the purchase of the asset being leased. 
The lessor pays the lending institution back by way of the lease payments received from the lessee. Under the loan agreement, the lender has rights to the asset and the lease payments if the lessor defaults. 
In this type of lease, the lessor provides an equity portion (often 20% to 50%) of the equipment cost and lenders provide the balance on a nonrecourse debt basis. The lessor receives the tax benefits of ownership.

Bruce Fancher

Bruce Fancher (also known as Timberwolf) (b. April 13, 1971) is a computer hacker, a former member of the legendary Legion of Doom hacker group. He co-founded MindVox in 1991 with Patrick K. Kroupa.
Early years.
Bruce Fancher grew up in New York City. He is the son of Ed Fancher, who founded the "Village Voice" with Dan Wolf and Norman Mailer, in 1955.
Much like Patrick Kroupa and many compatriots from the Legion of Doom, Bruce Fancher was part of the first generation to grow up with access to home computers and the networks that pre-dated the wide-scale adaptation of what became known as the internet.
Unlike most others, Fancher seems to have met most of the people who played major roles in his formative years, in person, at the YIPL/TAP meetings that were taking place on the Lower East Side of New York City. Fancher's peers included several hackers and phone phreaks of the day.
The hacker publication Phrack is filled with out-of-character rants at the games Fancher was playing. All of this culminated right around the time MindVox was first launched, with Phrack's first (and only) humor issue (Phrack #36) Phrack Magazine, also called "Diet Phrack", which was filled with LOD members stepping out from behind their usual handles and acting more like what the world had grown to expect from their rival gang, MOD (Masters of Deception).
Among other articles, such as Chris Goggans' "jive" version of the Book of MOD that set off the Great Hacker War, Phrack 36 included the first and last, official publication of an article co-written by Fancher and Kroupa, called "Elite Access", which was a cynical and funny expose of the "elite" and private hacker underground of the day. The article was apparently worked on and edited during a 5 year period, and there are at least 3 different versions of it that still remain online, including a much earlier, hardcore technical revision which has most of the commands to control phone company computers, deleted out of it.
Fancher and Kroupa's games with the "elite" made it into Kroupa's "Agr1ppa", a surreal parody of William Gibson's Agrippa, which had been leaked to the world from MindVox. The opening verses include a letter dated 1985, from the SysOp (System Operator) of a pirate Bulletin Board System which had apparently thrown both Fancher and Kroupa off the system, for uploading cracked software, which they then infected with a virus.
Lunatics running the asylum.
Neither Kroupa nor Fancher ever discussed the excess that was taking place behind the scenes until nearly a decade after the fact, but it was not a well kept secret. Although MindVox quickly became notorious for the escapades of its hard-partying clientele, there is little or no evidence that Fancher was involved personally in the wild lifestyles of its members. However, he was at least indirectly affected, in that by 1995 Kroupa's drug use was fast becoming legendary and his ability to function on a daily basis was diminishing. While the media's fascination with MindVox never ended, the development and growth of the system had slowed down and Phantom Access Technologies was taking on consulting positions to help other companies create their own online presence, and Fancher gained growing acclaim as a software architect and member of the dot.com technocracy.
21st Century.
While the last days of MindVox are more the stuff of mythology than recorded fact, and there are perpetual signs of MindVox coming back to life and opening again, it appears likely that MindVox either went dark, or shut off public access, at some time in late 1997. The two main publications which covered the shutting of the gates, were The New York Times and Wired, who were apparently unable to arrive at a consensus, with the Times listing the sale of MindVox's client-base and the closing of the system, in 1996, while Wired was still covering an apparently open and at least partially operational MindVox circa 1997, more than one year after the Times listed MindVox as being closed.
Whatever the past and future of MindVox holds, by the late 90's Fancher seems to have gone through a series of start-ups where he was one of the initial founders, saw the company through the first few years, and promptly cashed out. The best-known of these appears to be DuoCash, a micropayments company made infamous through a series of photographs posted on MindVox, taken from the DuoCash office building, located across the street from where the World Trade Center had stood a few days before.
As of 2005, Bruce Fancher is the vice president of Technology at Lagardere Active, North America.

Alleycats

The Alleycats is a Malaysian band which was formed in 1969, and gained popularity in the late 1970s. They consist of musicians from Penang who were popular in their home state earlier on in their career.
Band members.
The original members of the band were:
The current members are:
Their music is said to be influenced by Air Supply, Phil Collins, Bee Gees, Billy Joel, David Gates & Bread, Santana and Paul McCartney.
Most of the Alleycats albums were produced by Eric Yeo. Most of their hit songs were penned by music supremo M. Nasir with the lyrics composed by S.Amin Shahab. The M. Nasir/S.Amin combination were most noticeable on hit songs such as "Hingga Akhir Nanti (Till The End)", "Andai Aku Pergi Dulu (If I Go Before You)", "Sekuntum Mawar Merah Sebuah Puisi (A Red Rose And A Poem)", "Setahun Sudah Berlalu (A Year Has Passed)", "Seribu Bintang (A Thousand Stars)", "Nota Terakhir (This Last Note)".
History.
There were earlier line-ups of this band but the original line-up mentioned were the ones that took the Alleycats to great height of achievements musically. The Alleycats were always on top of the musical scene in Malaysia even before they were signed up as recording artistes.
This line-up secured a performance contract in the Mocambo Club situated in Central, a business sector on Hong Kong island in 1976. It was supposed to be a three-month contract but their success in wooing the crowd earned them three yearly contracts bundled with TV and concert appearances as means of promoting the band. They became a hit with the locals in Hong Kong. It was not until they left Hong Kong to start a new performance contract in Singapore that they were spotted by major recording companies.
The Alleycats started out in 1978 by signing a contract with Polygram Records-Philips to produce an album. They went to Hong Kong to record their album in Dragon Studio. Later, Lion Studio in Singapore was responsible for mastering the Alleycats' albums. Their first released album was "Terima Kasih (Thank You)", with their first single "Senandung Semalam (Yesterday's Serenade)".
The existence of this band was vital to the Malaysian music industry. With more than twenty recordings, they contributed to the development of the Malaysian music industry and is still regarded as one of the legendary Malaysian pop music bands of all time in the country. Despite the changes, they are still active in performing and recording. The Alleycats have a strong fan base from all walks of life in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.
Passing of Loganathan.
Loganathan Arumugam, a vocalist of the Alleycats, died on June 4, 2007 following an 8 month battle with lung cancer. His death was deeply mourned by Alleycats fans as reported in the press and media.
An Alleycats Music Video Competition, held as a tribute to the late Loganathan Arumugam of Alleycats was conducted between 25 June 2006 - 25 July 2007. This was jointly organised by NGT Solutions (M) Sdn Bhd and Universal Music Malaysia, with the support from Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC). It was in line with the government’s initiative in encouraging contentpreneurs to develop local content and to be able to identify creativity in the minds of Malaysians.
A year after the loss of Loga to lung cancer, the Alleycats will be the lead artistes in a concert organised by the Lung Foundation of Malaysia (LFM) to raise money for its activities. Established in November 2005, LFM is a non-profit Foundation geared towards offering support for patients afflicted with lung diseases to enable them to lead a better quality lifestyle with minimal suffering. The Foundation’s funds are generated solely from generous donations from corporate organisations, charitable bodies and the general public. The contributions will be used to provide monetary relief for underprivileged patients to undergo the necessary treatment. LFM will also fund scientific research, education and training to enhance the knowledge, skills and care for patients in Malaysia.)

Mark Zuckerberg

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American computer programmer, Internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is best known as one of five co-founders of the social networking website Facebook. As of April 2013, Zuckerberg is the chairman and chief executive of Facebook, Inc. and his personal wealth, as of April 2014, is estimated to be $25.3 billion. Mark Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.
Together with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from Harvard's dormitory rooms. The group then introduced Facebook onto other campuses nationwide and moved to Palo Alto, California shortly afterwards. In 2007, at the age of 23, Zuckerberg became a billionaire as a result of Facebook's success. The number of Facebook users worldwide reached a total of one billion in 2012. Zuckerberg was involved in various legal disputes that were initiated by others in the group, who claimed a share of the company based upon their involvement during the development phase of Facebook.
Since 2010, "Time" magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year distinction. In 2011, Zuckerberg ranked first on the list of the "Most Influential Jews in the World" by "The Jerusalem Post" and has since consistently topped the list every year as of 2013. Zuckerberg was played by actor Jesse Eisenberg in the 2010 film "The Social Network", in which the rise of Facebook is portrayed.
Early life.
Zuckerberg was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. He is the son of dentist Edward Zuckerberg and psychiatrist Karen Kempner. He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small town about 10 miles north of New York City. Zuckerberg was raised Jewish and had his bar mitzvah when he turned 13. Afterward, he became an atheist.
At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classics. He transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy and physics) and classical studies. On his college application, Zuckerberg claimed that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team. In college, he was known for reciting lines from epic poems such as "The Iliad".
Software developer.
Early years.
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. He enjoyed developing computer programs, especially communication tools and games. In one such program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.
According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas, Zuckerberg was not a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem "Aeneid", by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.
During Zuckerberg's high school years, under the company name Intelligent Media Group, he built a music player called the Synapse Media Player that used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from "PC Magazine".
College years.
By the time he began classes at Harvard, Zuckerberg had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy", notes Vargas. He studied psychology and computer science as well as belonging to Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity, and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year, he wrote a program he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, Arie Hasit, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:
We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.
The site went up over a weekend; but by Monday morning, the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."
The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.
Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. The three complained to the "Harvard Crimson" and the newspaper began an investigation in response. 
Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares that were worth US$300 million at Facebook's IPO.
Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project. In January 2014, Zuckerberg recalled:
I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.
Career.
Facebook.
Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room on February 4, 2004. An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, “The Photo Address Book,” which students referred to as “The Facebook.” Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.
Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, Penn, Brown, and Yale. Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. "Mark was clearly on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.
After Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto, California with Moskovitz and some friends, they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard but eventually decided to remain in California. They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."
He restated these goals to "Wired" magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open." Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook. On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.
In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book "", wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a hacker". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better". Facebook instituted "hackathons" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project. The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended. "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now... It's definitely very core to my personality."
"Vanity Fair" magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the Information Age". Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the "Vanity Fair" 100 list in 2009. In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in "New Statesman"'s annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.
In a 2011 interview with PBS after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".
On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market. Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million. Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.
On August 19, 2013, the "Washington Post" reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.
At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.
Zuckerberg is the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain in March, which will be attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company. Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.
Wirehog.
A month after Facebook launched in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications.
Platform, Beacon and Connect.
On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.
On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook, taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.
In 2007, Zuckerberg was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.
On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Connect, a version of Facebook Platform for users.
Internet.org.
In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. Zuckerberg explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the 5 billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:
The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.
Legal controversies.
ConnectU lawsuits.
Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU). They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.
In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of "02138", a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's social security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of "02138".
Saverin lawsuit.
A lawsuit filed by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.
Pakistan criminal investigation.
In June 2010, Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a "Draw Muhammad" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.
Paul Ceglia.
In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84% ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was "Facemash", the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name "thefacebook.com" until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.
On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars." Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them. Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.
Depictions in media.
"The Social Network".
A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, "The Social Network" was released on October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive." Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy". The film is based on the book "The Accidental Billionaires" by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than "reportage". The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told "New York" magazine, "I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?"
Upon winning the Golden Globes award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.” Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:
On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on "Saturday Night Live", which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met. Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, "It was interesting." In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him ..." He adds, "Mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do "SNL" and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It’s the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable."
Disputed accuracy.
Jeff Jarvis, author of the book "Public Parts", interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, "That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts."
According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at "Fortune" magazine and author of "The Facebook Effect:The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World," (2011), "the film is only "40% true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet".
Although the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg himself said he had no interest in joining the clubs. Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated... It is fiction..." He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend".
Other depictions.
Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of "The Simpsons" titled "Loan-a Lisa", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.
On October 9, 2010, "Saturday Night Live" lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook. Andy Samberg played Zuckerberg. The real Zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: "I thought this was funny."
Stephen Colbert awarded a "Medal of Fear" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, "because he values his privacy much more than he values yours".
Use of other social networks.
Zuckerberg created an account with Google+ soon after the social network was unveiled, saying he sees it as a "validation for his vision" of online social networking. By July 2011, Zuckerberg had become the most followed user on Google+, outranking Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. As of March 6, 2012, his ranking has dropped to 184 on the service, behind Page and Brin. His public profile is minimal with one photo and a bio that reads "I make things".
Zuckerberg has maintained a private account on Twitter under the username "zuck", and in 2009 he revealed that the public account "finkd" also belonged to him.
Philanthropy.
Zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a "cool idea".
Zuckerberg founded the Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of "The Social Network", which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about "The Social Network" movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate." Newark Mayor Cory A. Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.
On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed a promise they called the "Giving Pledge", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50% or more of their wealth to charity.
On December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month—based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported on February 10, 2014 that Zuckerberg's donation was the largest charitable gift on the public record in 2013 and put Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans in 2013, having donated roughly 1 billion dollars to charity.
Politics.
In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as “no preference” on voter rolls, and he voted in the past two general elections, in 2008 and 2012. On Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he has Chris Christie, Cory Booker, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Barack Obama in his likes section.
Mark Zuckerberg has never specified his own political views: some consider him a conservative, while others consider him liberal. Numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United have all have agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or hold off on buying Facebook ads for at least two weeks. It was to protest to Mark Zuckerberg over ads funded by FWD.us by touting the support for oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline and opposition to Obamacare among Republican US senators who back immigration reform.
On February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools. Later that year, Zuckerberg would host a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election. In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a $100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools. In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.
On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg. The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the US, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.
A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is "just about tech wanting to hire more people", the Internet entrepreneur replied: "The bigger problem we’re trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly."
In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.
When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government "blew it." He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.
Personal life.
Marriage.
At a party put on by his fraternity during his sophomore year, Zuckerberg met Priscilla Chan, a fellow student whom he began dating in 2003. Chan is the child of a Chinese-Vietnamese refugee, who arrived in the U.S. after the Fall of Saigon. She was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and is a 2003 graduate of Quincy High School. In September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco, to move into his rented Palo Alto house. Zuckerberg studied Mandarin Chinese in preparation for the couple's visit to the People's Republic of China in December 2010.
On May 19, 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan married in Zuckerberg's backyard in a celebration also marking her graduation from medical school.
Interests.
On Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he listed his personal interests as "openness, making things that help people connect and share what's important to them, revolutions, information flow, minimalism". Zuckerberg sees blue best because of red–green color blindness; blue is also Facebook's dominant color.

Nonrecourse debt

Non-recourse debt or a non-recourse loan is a secured loan (debt) that is secured by a pledge of collateral, typically real property, but for which the borrower is not personally liable. If the borrower defaults, the lender/issuer can seize the collateral, but the lender's recovery is limited to the collateral. Thus, non-recourse debt is typically limited to 50% or 60% loan-to-value ratios, so that the property itself provides "overcollateralization" of the loan.
The incentives for the parties are at an intermediate position between those of a full recourse secured loan and a totally unsecured loan. While the borrower is in first loss position, the lender also assumes significant risk, so the lender must underwrite the loan with much more care than in a full recourse loan. This typically requires that the lender have significant domain expertise and financial modeling expertise.
Nonrecourse debt is used for residential mortgage loans in the United States, although most of Europe enforces mortgage debt forgiveness after eviction.
Common uses.
Non-recourse debt is typically used to finance commercial real estate, shipping or other similar projects with high capital expenditures, long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. It is also commonly used for stock loans and other securities-collateralized lending structures. Since most commercial real estate is owned in a partnership structure (or similar tax pass-through), non-recourse borrowing gives the real estate owner the tax benefits of a tax-pass-through partnership structure (that is, loss pass-through and no double taxation), and simultaneously limits personal liability to the value of the investment.
In some states, "antideficiency statutes" provide that mortgages secured by personal residences are non-recourse against the borrower.
A non-recourse debt of $30 billion was issued to JPMorgan Chase by the Federal Reserve in order to purchase Bear Stearns on March 16, 2008. The non-recourse loan was issued with Bear Stearns's less liquid assets as collateral, meaning that the Federal Reserve will absorb the loss should the value of those assets be below their collateralized value.
Self-directed IRA investors who choose to purchase investment real estate are able to leverage their purchase with a non-recourse loan. Because of the IRS regulations, it would be deemed a violation of the qualified retirement account status to personally guarantee any loan on real estate owned by a self-directed IRA.
Non recourse lawsuit funding.
There is another type of non recourse funding available, often used to provide cash to plaintiffs involved in a contingency based lawsuit. The money is a cash advance on the anticipated settlement amount, and is based on a percentage of that amount. This money is true non recourse funding, in that if the case is lost, you owe the lawsuit funding company nothing. They are actually investing in the lawsuit. For this reason, they require case documentation from the plaintiffs attorney, which is kept in complete confidence. The funders will review the case files an if they feel the case is worthwhile, they will invest in it.
This money is not cheap in comparison to a home equity loan, or even a credit card cash advance. This is because lenders prey on plaintiffs who cannot afford to lose their cases, so they give away a large percentage of any potential recovery in order to guarantee a small, immediate reward. People who incur this type of debt often wind up worse off in the long run had they simply waited out a settlement.
Characterization.
Non-recourse debt is usually carried on a debtor company's balance sheet as a liability, and the collateral is carried as an asset.
Tax consequences of disposition of property encumbered by non-recourse debt.
For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the interaction among the concepts of (1) the "amount realized" upon a disposition, (2) the amount of non-recourse debt, and (3) the amount of adjusted basis in the property is fairly complex. The tax consequences of a disposition depend on whether the taxpayer acquired the property with the non-recourse debt already attached, or whether the taxpayer took out the non-recourse debt after acquisition of the property, and the relative relationships between fair market value (FMV) and purchase price and disposition price.
Basic concept: Computing gain or loss on a disposition.
Upon a sale or other disposition of property under U.S. income tax law, a taxable gain generally results where the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of property exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in that property.
Generally, the amount realized is the amount of cash and other consideration received by the taxpayer. The amount of any loan forgiven or discharged is generally part of that consideration.
The adjusted basis is the sum of the following:
If the amount realized exceeds the amount of adjusted basis, the taxpayer has realized a gain at the time of disposition. If the adjusted basis exceeds the amount realized, a loss has been incurred. The federal income tax effect of non-recourse debt may be explained by first considering the tax effect of a disposition involving recourse debt (that is, a debt in which the property provides first security coverage, and the borrower/taxpayer is personally liable for any deficiency that may remain after the lender forecloses against the property), and then contrasting against similar facts involving non-recourse debt, as follows:
Disposition of property subject to a recourse debt.
Example:
Assuming that the creditor forecloses on the property and that the $20,000 excess of the debt over the property's fair market value ($100,000 less $80,000) is contractually discharged (for didactic symmetry with the non-recourse example, let's assume, contrary to the commercial point of a recourse loan, that the debt is outright forgiven by the creditor, with no actual payment), the taxpayer would realize the $20,000 amount as income from the discharge of indebtedness. That $20,000 of forgiveness would be taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the discharge. The $35,000 excess of the fair market value over the adjusted basis ($80,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the "sale or other disposition" of the property – again, even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the foreclosure.
Disposition of property subject to a non-recourse debt.
Assuming the same facts except that the debt is non-recourse, the result would be quite different. The taxpayer would realize zero taxable ordinary income from the discharge of debt. Instead, the entire $55,000 difference between the unpaid principal of the debt and the taxpayer's adjusted basis ($100,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the "sale or other disposition" of the property—again, even though no cash is received by the taxpayer at the time of foreclosure.
At the sale, foreclosure or other disposition, non-recourse debt incurred as part of the financing of the acquisition, and money extracted from an investment by mortgaging out, are treated the same: both are taxable realization only at the time of the property's disposition, even if, at time of disposition, the property is worth less than the amount of the mortgage. Non-recourse debt that is in place at the time of acquisition of the property is included in basis, "Crane v. Commissioner", subsequent borrowing is not. "Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner". Subsequent borrowing proceeds reinvested in a depreciable property thereby avoid "Woodsam" and take advantage of "Crane".
United States.
According to the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), at least 10 states can be generally classified as non-recourse for residential mortgages:
Recent legislation also makes Nevada non-recourse in most cases for residential purchasers for mortgages obtained on or after October 1, 2009.

It's Grim Up North

"It's Grim Up North" was a 1991 single by The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), the main lyrics of which consist of a list of towns and cities in the North of England, set to a pounding industrial techno kick beat and percussion reminiscent of steam whistles, all of which segue into an orchestral instrumental of the hymn "Jerusalem". The track reached # 10 in the UK Singles Chart.
Conception.
"It's Grim Up North" was first previewed in December 1990 as a limited edition "Club Mix" with Pete Wylie on vocals. A re-recorded version with Bill Drummond on vocals received a regular release on KLF Communications in October 1991, peaking at #10 in the UK singles chart.
A recurring theme was drab greyness, representing the dreary, overcast skies of the "grim" North. The original release featuring Pete Wylie was on grey-coloured vinyl, and the same colour was retained for the sleeve of the 1991 issue. The video for "It's Grim Up North" was filmed in black and white and showed The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu performing in the pouring rain. Bill Drummond voices the words into a CB microphone held by a female mannequin in military uniform and a tin hat labelled "KLF". Jimmy Cauty is shown playing bass guitar. Cars and trucks rush by, leaving a trail of spray, as evidently The JAMs are performing on one lane of a road, they are lit by the headlights of several vehicles stopped by the performance. As the performance draws to a close, and strains of "Jerusalem" can be heard, the slogan "The North will rise again" appears on screen.
The sleevenotes further elaborated on The JAMs' inspiration: "Through the downpour and diesel roar, Rockman and Kingboy D can feel a regular dull thud. Whether this is the eternal echo of a Victorian steam driven revolution or the turbo kick of a distant Northern rave is irrelevant. Thus inspired, The JAMS climb into the back of their truck and work."
The single was the first release under The KLF's "JAMs" alias since the 1988 compilation album "Shag Times", and the last under that name. The release, with its markedly darker tone, punctuated The KLF's string of upbeat house hits, and it was planned that "It's Grim Up North" would be a prominent track on the ultimately unreleased album "The Black Room".
"It's Grim Up North" graffiti - which had, since the early 1970s, been presented to northbound travellers on a bridge spanning the M1- led to a question about "regional imbalance" being asked in the House of Commons.
The single "It's Weird Out West" by Radsonic (1992) was an affectionate homage to the track, the list of northern towns being replaced by locations in Wiltshire and Somerset. Only five hundred copies are known to have been produced, although Annie Nightingale did play it on her BBC Radio 1 programme.
Composition.
"It's Grim Up North (Part 1)" is a 10-minute composition with two distinct segueing sections. The first 7-minute section is a heavy, pounding industrial techno track, over which Drummond gives a roll-call of Northern towns, through a CB microphone. Between verses, Drummond's processed voice urgently alerts us that "It's grim up North". The instrumentation is in minor key and frequently discordant, featuring synthesised sounds reminiscent of passing heavy goods vehicles and steam whistles. Although the underlying rhythm holds a 4/4 time signature, several instruments keep 3/16 and 3/4 time throughout the track, including a deep second drum line - the "regular dull thud" - which juxtaposes when the 4/4 instruments and percussion drop out.
The second section is a fully orchestrated arrangement of "Jerusalem", with the sounds of brass, strings, organs, drums and choir. The instrumentation and vocals of the first section gradually diminish to nothing over a period of nearly two minutes. Following the climax of the hymn, howling wind and crow calls are heard to fade out.
"It's Grim Up North (Part 2)" is a 6-minute reprise of the techno themes from Part 1, without the vocals and orchestra.
Reviews.
"Record Mirror" hailed the original club version as "the hardest rave track of the year" to be "one mind-blowing mental onslaught".
In awarding the 1991 release "single of the week", "NME" said: "The Scotsman ] picks over the place names with gruesome relish, the backing track pummels and tweaks, blasts and buffets him round the furthest God-forsaken reaches of this demi-paradise, this land of kings, this sceptred isle, this England... A thing of feverish, fiendish irreverence and conceptual genius...".
In a 2007 article regarding songs about Northern England, The Guardian described the track thus: "It's Grim Up North, by a pseudonymous KLF, wrongfoots the listener. A deadpan catalogue of northern towns, recited over rainy-motorway techno, suddenly blossoms into a rendition of Blake's Jerusalem, as if arriving at some socialist rave utopia.".
Locations.
All locations are in the North of England. They are predominantly in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Scarborough is the furthest north in the list and the furthest south is Derby. The full list of locations in the lyrics follows:
First verse.
Bolton, Barnsley, Nelson, Colne, Burnley, Bradford, Buxton, Crewe, Warrington, Widnes, Wigan, Leeds, Northwich, Nantwich, Knutsford, Hull, Sale, Salford, Southport, Leigh, Derby, Kearsley, Keighley, Maghull, Harrogate, Huddersfield, Oldham, Lancs, Grimsby, Glossop, Hebden Bridge.

Formats and track listings.
"It's Grim up North" was originally released as a limited edition one-side promotional 12" on 17 December 1990. Reworked with Drummond's vocals, the track was given a European single release on 28 October 1991. The CD single track "Jerusalem on the Moors" comprises the orchestral arrangement of "Jerusalem", beginning alongside a fadeout of the industrial techno instrumentation. The single's formats and track listings are tabulated below:

CJWA-FM

CJWA-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 107.1 FM in Wawa, Ontario. The station broadcasts an adult contemporary format under the on-air brand JJAM or JJAM FM.
History.
CJWA was originally launched in 1964 by Sault Ste. Marie's Highland Broadcasting as an AM station, broadcasting at 1240 kHz on the AM dial. The station aired a mixture of original programming and simulcasting of the Sault station CJIC. In 1976, an ownership shuffle in the Sault gave CJWA to Huron Broadcasting, which converted the station's simulcast source to its own CKCY.
In 1985, CKCY and CJWA were acquired by CKCY 920 Ltd., who again changed the station's simulcasting source, this time to CKCY's sister station CJQM. In 1988, the stations were acquired by the Mid-Canada Radio network, which in turn was sold to the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990. Pelmorex changed the station's simulcasting source again, this time to CHAS.
Closure.
Pelmorex subsequently closed the station (CJWA 1240 AM) in September 1996.
Reopening of CJWA.
In 1998, North Superior Broadcasting received approval from the CRTC to reopen CJWA as an FM station, which would replace their existing Wawa rebroadcaster of CFNO in Marathon. In 1999, the station added a rebroadcast transmitter at 100.7 FM in Chapleau, also through conversion of an existing CFNO retransmitter, as well as a new rebroadcaster at Michipicoten.
In 2002, CJWA-FM was acquired by Labbe Media and now operates under the supervision of president and CEO Rick Labbe.
On January 18, 2005, Labbe Media Incorporated received approval by the CRTC to change the authorized contours of its transmitter CJWA-FM-1 Chapleau, by decreasing the effective radiated power from 130 watts to 111 watts and by decreasing the effective antenna height from 37 metres to 30.5 metres.

<doc id="2844970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844970" title="Koriya">
Koriya

Koriya State, also spelled as Korea, was a princely state of the British Raj. After Indian independence in 1947, the ruler of Koriya acceded to the Union of India on 1 January 1948, and Koriya was made part of Surguja District of Central Provinces and Berar province. On January 1950, “Central Provinces and Berar” province was renamed Madhya Pradesh state. After November 2000, Koriya and the former princely state of Changbhakar became Koriya district of Chhattisgarh state.
Koriya had an area of 1,631 sq. miles and a population of 126,874 as of 1941.
Location.
The state of Koriya, which included 400 villages, was in what is now Chhattisgarh state. It bordered Rewa to the north and alsoto the southwest; Surguja to the east; the British district of Bilaspur (Central Provinces) to the south; and Changbhakar to the west.
History.
Koriya state was founded in the seventeenth century.
The ruling family of Koriya were Rajputs of the Chauhan dynasty who came to Koriya from Rajputana in the 13th century and conquered the country. Before the coming of the Marathas, it is alleged that the rajas of Koriya “lived in perfect independence, and never having been necessitated to submit to the payment of any tribute, they had no occasion to oppress their subjects.” This situation changed in 1790, and Koriya had to pay tribute to the Marathas. Koriya also seems to have had some indefinite feudal relations with Surguja, but the British government ignored this claim when Koriya was ceded to them by the Bhonsle raja of Nagpur in 1818. On 24 Dec 1819 the state became a British protectorate. Upon the extinction of the direct line in 1897, a distant collateral branch of the ruling family was recognized as successor by the British Raj.
In 1891, the Raj decided that the five states of the Surguja group (Surguja, Udaipur, Jashpur, Koriya, and Changbhakar), as well as the states of Bonai, Gangpur, Seraikela, and Kharsawan, formerly known as the Tributary Mahals of Chhota Nagpur, were not part of British India, and revised sanads were issued in 1899 formally recognizing them as feudatory states and defining their relations with the British Raj.
Rulers.
The rulers of the state have apparently always held the title of 'Raja' and were so recognized by the British as early as 1819.

Financial modeling

Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Financial modeling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications. While there has been some debate in the industry as to the nature of financial modeling—whether it is a tradecraft, such as welding, or a science—the task of financial modeling has been gaining acceptance and rigor over the years. Typically, financial modeling is understood to mean an exercise in either asset pricing or corporate finance, of a quantitative nature. In other words, financial modelling is about translating a set of hypotheses about the behavior of markets or agents into numerical predictions; for example, a firm's decisions about investments (the firm will invest 20% of assets), or investment returns (returns on "stock A" will, on average, be 10% higher than the market's returns).
Accounting.
In corporate finance, investment banking, and the accounting profession "financial modeling" is largely synonymous with financial statement forecasting. This usually involves the preparation of detailed company specific models used for decision making purposes and financial analysis. 
Applications include: 
To generalize as to the nature of these models: firstly, as they are built around financial statements, calculations and outputs are monthly, quarterly or annual; secondly, the inputs take the form of “assumptions”, where the analyst "specifies" the values that will apply in each period for external / global variables (exchange rates, tax percentage, etc.… (may be thought of as the model "parameters")), and for internal / company specific variables (wages, unit costs, etc.…). Correspondingly, both characteristics are reflected (at least implicitly) in the mathematical form of these models: firstly, the models are in discrete time; secondly, they are deterministic.For discussion of the issues that may arise, see below; for discussion as to more sophisticated approaches sometimes employed, see Corporate finance: Quantifying uncertainty.
Modelers are sometimes referred to (tongue in cheek) as "number crunchers", and are often designated "financial analyst". Typically, the modeler will have completed an MBA or MSF with (optional) coursework in "financial modeling". Accounting qualifications and finance certifications such as the CIIA and CFA generally do not provide direct or explicit training in modeling. At the same time, numerous commercial training courses are offered, both through universities and privately.
Although purpose built software does exist, the vast proportion of the market is spreadsheet-based - this is largely since the models are almost always company specific; also, analysts will each have their own criteria and methods for financial modeling. Microsoft Excel now has by far the dominant position, having overtaken Lotus 1-2-3 in the 1990s. Spreadsheet-based modelling can have its own problems, and several standardizations and "best practices" have been proposed. "Spreadsheet risk" is increasingly studied and managed.
One critique here, is that model "outputs", i.e. line items, often incorporate “unrealistic implicit assumptions” and “internal inconsistencies”. (For example, a forecast for growth in revenue but without corresponding increases in working capital, fixed assets and the associated financing, may imbed unrealistic assumptions about asset turnover, leverage and / or equity financing.) What is required, but often lacking, is that all key elements are explicitly and consistently forecasted. Related to this, is that modellers often additionally "fail to identify crucial assumptions" relating to "inputs", "and to explore what can go wrong". Here, in general, modellers "use point values and simple arithmetic instead of probability distributions and statistical measures" - i.e., as mentioned, the problems are treated as deterministic in nature - and thus calculate a single value for the asset or project, but without providing information on the range, variance and sensitivity of outcomes. Other critiques discuss the lack of adequate spreadsheet design skills, and of basic computer programming concepts. More serious criticism, in fact, relates to the nature of budgeting itself, and its impact on the organization.
The annual "Modeloff Financial Modeling World Championships" is held in New York annually since 2013.
Quantitative finance.
In quantitative finance, "financial modeling" entails the development of a sophisticated mathematical model. Models here deal with asset prices, market movements, portfolio returns and the like. A key distinction is between models of the financial situation of a large, complex firm or "quantitative financial management", models of the returns of different stocks or "quantitative asset pricing", models of the price or returns of derivative securities or "financial engineering" and models of the firm's financial decisions or "quantitative corporate finance".
Applications include: 
These problems are often stochastic and continuous in nature, and models here thus require complex algorithms, entailing computer simulation, advanced numerical methods (such as numerical differential equations, numerical linear algebra, dynamic programming) and/or the development of optimization models. The general nature of these problems is discussed under , while specific techniques are listed under Outline of finance: Mathematical tools. For further discussion here see also: Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering; Brownian model of financial markets; Martingale pricing.
Modellers are generally referred to as "quants" (quantitative analysts), and typically have advanced (Ph.D. level) backgrounds in quantitative disciplines such as physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics or operations research. Alternatively, or in addition to their quantitative background, they complete a finance masters with a quantitative orientation, such as the Master of Quantitative Finance, or the more specialized Master of Computational Finance or Master of Financial Engineering; the CQF is increasingly common.
Although spreadsheets are widely used here also (almost always requiring extensive VBA), custom C++ or numerical analysis software such as MATLAB is often preferred, particularly where stability or speed is a concern. MATLAB is the tool of choice for doing economics research because of its intuitive programming, graphical and debugging tools, but C++/Fortran are preferred for conceptually simple but high computational-cost applications where MATLAB is too slow. Additionally, for many (of the standard) derivative and portfolio applications, commercial software is available, and the choice as to whether the model is to be developed in-house, or whether existing products are to be deployed, will depend on the problem in question.
The complexity of these models may result in incorrect pricing or hedging or both. This "Model risk" is the subject of ongoing research by finance academics, and is a topic of great, and growing, interest in the risk management arena.
Criticism of the discipline (often preceding the financial crisis of 2007–08 by several years) emphasizes the differences between the mathematical and physical sciences and finance, and the resultant caution to be applied by modelers, and by traders and risk managers using their models. Notable here are Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott, authors of the "Financial Modelers' Manifesto". Some go further and question whether mathematical- and statistical modeling may be applied to finance at all, at least with the assumptions usually made (for options; for portfolios). In fact, these may go so far as to question the "empirical and scientific validity... of modern financial theory". Notable here are Nassim Taleb and Benoit Mandelbrot.

Zhoukou

Zhoukou (; Postal map spelling: Chowkow) is a prefecture-level city in eastern Henan province, People's Republic of China. It borders Zhumadian to the southeast, Xuchang and Luohe to the west, Kaifeng to the northwest, Shangqiu to the northeast, and the province of Anhui on all other sides.
Administration.
The prefecture-level city of Zhoukou administers 1 district, 1 county-level city and 8 counties.
History.
For thousands of years, Chen (now at Huaiyang) had been the center of this area and a nationally well-known city. The ancient city site founded at Pingliangtai (near Huaiyang) is over 4600 years old, which is one of the oldest cities in China. According to the legend, Fu Xi, the first of the Three Sovereigns of ancient China, died in the city. During the Spring and Autumn Period, Chen was the capital of Chen State and then annexed by Chu. Therefore, the area was usually referred to as "Chen Chu" in ancient times. The leaders of the first Chinese peasant uprising (the Dazexiang Uprising) established the government at Chen.
The city's name "Zhoukou" is short for "Zhoujiakou", which literally means "Zhou's ferry". Located at the intersection of Jialu River and Shaying River, it started to develop as a river harbor of China's Inland Water Transport System in the early Ming Dynasty. By the end of 18th century, two towns along the rivers merged into one big town with several tens of thousand permanent residents. From the port, cargo could either be shipped south to the Yangtze River or north to the Yellow River. However, after the "sea ban" was canceled, sea transport began to play a major role on the trade between Jiangnan and North China, which diminished the utility of inland waterways. The cost of maintaining the river channels kept increasing because of the ever-rising river bed. The appearance of railways and modern roads in the early 20th century lead to a recession in the water transport business nearby. Finally, in 1970s, a dam was built on the Shaying River, which cut the city's last waterway.
In 2000, the government of the Zhoukou prefecture-level city was founded. The old county-level city and its suburban area became Chuanhui District.
Economy.
Zhoukou is a major agricultural producer in the province of Henan. Its economy is mainly based on the trade of agricultural products, such as grain, cotton, oil, meat and tobacco. In particular, Zhoukou is famous for the skin of the Huai Goat, a local breed of goat.

The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore

"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore" (1963) is a play written by Tennessee Williams.
It debuted at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy, in July 1962. Its first American production was in January 1963, but it only ran for 69 performances at the Morosco Theatre in New York. Reviews of the play were generally poor. The play was revised and re-mounted in January 1964 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre under the direction of Tony Richardson and starring Tallulah Bankhead and Tab Hunter, with Marian Seldes. It ran only 5 performances after again receiving very poor notices. The 2011 revival starring Olympia Dukakis was directed by Michael Wilson.
In 1968, the play was adapted by Williams into the film "Boom!", co-starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and directed by Joseph Losey.
Synopsis.
The play is set in Italy and centres on a dying, wealthy woman, Mrs Flora Goforth, who catches a young man, Christopher Flanders, allegedly trespassing on her estate. Dialogue between the two makes up much of the play. At the end Mrs Goforth dies after her long struggle with terminal illness.

Ralph Furley

Ralph Furley is the name of a fictional character from the sitcom "Three's Company", played by Don Knotts.
Ralph Furley is the landlord of a Santa Monica apartment building that is now owned by his brother, Bart, who acquired it from Stanley Roper. It is the home to Jack Tripper, Larry Dallas, Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow (later to Cindy Snow and Terri Alden). Furley fancies himself a "ladies' man" and a "macho man", despite the fact he has not had a date in years.
Furley is very subservient and seems to fear his brother.
Like Stanley Roper before him, Furley is also tricked into believing that Jack is gay in order for him to continue living with Janet and Chrissy. Also, like Roper, Furley liked to occasionally crack gay jokes about Jack at his expense.
He often wears outlandish leisure suits in very loud colors with ascots. Usually his shirts are very brightly colored. For his role as Mr. Furley, Knotts donned a toupee.
Although Furley's brother, Bart, is frequently mentioned by him, he is only seen in one episode. Furley defends his decisions as landlord by stating his brother, Bart, would (or would not) also approve of the decision, as owner. Many of the characteristics and mannerisms of Ralph Furley are comparable to Knott's other well-known character, Barney Fife.

James Hopes

James Redfern Hopes (born 24 October 1978 in Townsville, Queensland) is an Australian cricketer. Hopes plays domestic cricket for Queensland, he has represented Australia in One Day International and Twenty20 cricket.
Under-19s Career.
Hopes had played for Australia's Under-19s side as a batsman but as his career has progressed he has become more of a bowling all-rounder. 
Players as a 13-year-old and played in the state's under-age sides before progressing to the Australia Under-19 team - he scored 105, 71 and 51 at the 1998 Youth World Cup
Domestic Career.
Hopes was earmarked for higher honours in national youth teams but took a few years to settle once graduating to the first-class level.
Hopes who made his debut in 2001 is the Bulls' leading wicket-taker in the one-day competition and Stuart MacGill's record of 124 is under threat.
He has five Pura Cup centuries for Queensland and two one-day hundreds, but bowling was his main weapon in the domestic competition in 2005/06. He collected 15 wickets at 18.33 in the ING Cup and 16 at 22.56 in the Pura Cup, but was unable to transfer his regular success into the international arena.
He had opened innings for Queensland in 2006/07 scoring 553 runs and taking 21 wickets in the Pura Cup, and capturing a season-high 20 victims and a first one-day century in the FR Cup.
The IPL franchise King's XI Punjab picked him up and he was a fine contributor in the opening season, but missed the second event to rest an injury, and was hurt in the lead-up to the third tournament.
In 2010/11, he was handed the state captaincy replacing Chris Simpson. He was named Sheffield Shield Player of the Series for the 2010/11 series. He became 49th captain of the state.
In November 2010, Hopes picked up 3 for 40 and then top scored with 73 as the Bulls pushed well past Tasmania's disappointing 196 on the second day at Bellerive Oval.
In December 2010, he took-up coaching role of Queensland as caretaker coach began with a victory after he replaced Trevor Barsby on a sensational day for the Bulls where they bowled out Western Australia on 136 and won the match by 76 runs.
In Big Bash match against Tasmania, he scored unbeaten 65 runs and also affected a run-out and took a one-handed catch to dismiss Ryan ten Doeschate was declared the Man-of-the-Match.
In Big Bash match against New South Wales, he scored unbeaten 62 runs 38 balls and the set match off the very first ball when James Hopes bowled Usman Khawaja who chopped a pull back onto his stumps.
In 2011, an allround performance from Hopes led Queensland to a comfortable six-wicket victory against New South Wales in Ryobi Cup. Hopes provided a solid start with 41 off 56 deliveries before this he took 4 wickets for 16 runs.
Hopes took six-wicket haul and ensured that Queensland finished in third place on the 2010/11 Sheffield Shield table with victory by an innings and three runs over Victoria.
Hopes was named the Sheffield Shield Player of the Series for 2010/11 at the State Cricket Awards in Hobart. Hopes finished season with averaged of 58.70 with the bat and 20.11 with the ball winning 23 votes won the award ahead of Tasmania allrounder Luke Butterworth.
In 2011 Big Bash League, Hopes was signed with the Brisbane Heat.
In IPL 2012, he signed Sahara Pune Warriors from Delhi Daredevils. Hopes was the second foreigner to be contracted by Warriors in the transfer window. But Pune Warriors had suffered a setback to their IPL preparations with a knee injury ruling out the Hopes.
Hopes led from the front with a half-century in the first innings and a five-wicket haul in the second in 2011/12 Sheffield Shield final.
In 2012 BBL, Hopes opened the batting led the way with 49 against Melbourne Stars then returned with the figure of 3/28.
International Career.
He made eight ODI appearances in 2004/05. He did not take more than a wicket in a match although his batting showed promise with a top score of 43 against Sri Lanka.
Hopes was dropped from the squad at the end of the VB Series and missed the tour to South Africa, but when Shane Watson suffered a calf problem in Bangladesh he was replaced by his Queensland team-mate. 
Despite the late-season promotion, Hopes was cut from the national contract list and told to re-impress in interstate competition.
When another Watson injury occurred Hopes was put on World Cup standby before regaining his Cricket Australia deal.
Hopes' most productive day at elite level came in 2010 when his 5 for 14 ensured Australia would not be embarrassed by Ireland in an ODI in Dublin. The career-best figures were a deserved reward for a low-key player who pops in to deliver handy overs or scramble late runs. 
His 57 off 26 balls against West Indies at MCG was one of three career half-centuries, coming after he had been an ODI fixture for most of 2009. In 31 matches he scored 501 runs at 25 and added 27 wickets.
In 2007/08, he experienced a busy campaign with 24 ODIs as he took part in all of Australia's one-day series. As well as useful batting contributions, there was usually a breakthrough in every game and his multi-purpose skills became highly valued by the team. 
In March 2008, Hopes scored his maiden ODI half century during his 28th match, scoring 63 off 80 balls against India in the 2nd final of the 2007/08 Commonwealth Bank Series. His effort though was in vain as India went on to win the game and the series.
Style.
He has been a regular with the limited-overs squads, chipping in as an evenly balanced allrounder. A brisk medium-pacer who shapes the ball, he is also an aggressive and versatile batsman who has been used at the top and lower reaches of the order. 
Throughout his career he has had to fight for international recognition, battling with Shane Watson, Andrew Symonds, Cameron White and Steven Smith for game time.
A regular sweater in the gym, Hopes would love to be a professional golfer, but instead drives powerfully through the covers.
Awards.

John Rae (educator)

Dr John Rae (20 March 1931 – 16 December 2006) was a British educator, author and novelist. He was headmaster of Taunton School (1966-1970) and then Head Master of Westminster School (1970-1986).
In 1986 he became head of the Laura Ashley Foundation and was on the Board of "The Observer" newspaper from 1986 to 1993. In 1989 he became executive chairman of the Portman Group.
Education.
Rae was educated at Bishop Stortford College, an independent school in Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.
Westminster School.
Rae became Headmaster of Westminster School, an independent school in Central London, in 1970. During his time there he became a prominent and oft-heard voice on educational questions in the British media.
He modernised the school and rescued it from its perilous financial position. To do this, he cut staffing and moved the science department from its cramped building to a modern building within easy reach of the school. During his time at the school girls first became full-time members of the school, in 1973. In 1976 a new day house, Dryden's, was created. It is located next to Wren's and under College, just off Little Dean's Yard. In 1981 to cope with the increased numbers of girls a new boarding house, Purcell's, was opened located about 200m from Little Dean's Yard. In the same year a new building was bought for the Under School - Adrian House in Vincent Square.
Although it has been asserted that he was forced to resign because of negative reactions to his wife Daphne Rae publishing, "A World Apart" in 1983, detailing their joint experiences during their time at Taunton and Harrow. he remained at the school until 1986. According to his posthumously published diary, his departure was a combination of exceeding the typical term of headmastership (10 years), his opposition to the Assisted Places Scheme, and a desire to find a new challenge..
Media appearances.
During the 1980s, Rae wrote newspaper articles and regularly appeared as a panellist on programmes such as "Question Time" on BBC 1 and "Any Questions" on BBC Radio 4, and as an interviewee on "Newsnight" on BBC 2, in which he often argued for the need for schools to be tolerant and to "apply common sense" when dealing with minor infractions of the rules or end-of-term 'high jinks', and that a sense of humour was almost a pre-requisite of "firm but fair" discipline when dealing with teenage pupils, and especially teenage boys. He said that drug-taking was entirely unacceptable, but that pupils should only be expelled if they had committed serious offences, such as supplying and/or selling drugs, or had dishonestly claimed to be innocent when given the chance to 'own up'. He also said that he believed that a co-educational school environment had many merits. He also emphasised that, in his opinion, it was not merely the right of parents to choose to educate their children at independent schools, but also the right of educators not employed by the state to provide education.
Works.
Rae was a prolific writer on education, his works including "Letters to Parents", "The Public School Revolution", and a professional autobiography, "Delusions of Grandeur". His 1961 novel, "The Custard Boys", shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rees Memorial Prize, was adapted to make the 1962 film "Reach for Glory", which won a United Nations Award, and again for the 1979 film under the novel's original name. In 1983, he assisted Roland Joffe in the production of the film "The Killing Fields", and in 1986 he became head of the Laura Ashley Foundation. He was on the board of "The Observer" newspaper from 1986 to 1993, and in 1989 became executive chairman of the Portman Group, which advocates responsible drinking.
His edited diaries were published in 2009 as "The Old Boys' Network: A Headmaster's Diaries 1979-1986" (ISBN 978-1-906021-63-4).
Commemoration.
John Rae's ashes lie off the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, near a door from Little Dean's Yard used by Westminster boys when they go "Up Abbey". There is often a vase of fresh flowers at the commemorative stone.

Frank Leech

Frank Leech (1900 – 1953) was a prominent Anarchist in Glasgow, Scotland.
Leech, a Scotsman of Irish descent. In 1916 he had joined the Navy during World War One where he became service heavyweight champion, he would later work in mines and as a newsagent, [http://libcom.org/history/leech-frank-1900-1953 he would run several papers, among them "Fighting Call," later incorporating another paper, "Freedom". [http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/meltzer/sp001591/angels2.html]
He also ran a radical bookshop, Bakunin Press Bookshop, on Buchanan Street, Glasgow, named after anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. [http://www.fiveleaves.co.uk/radical_bookselling.html] The shop was associated with the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation.
Political Activity.
Leech got turned onto politics primarily through his experiences of the war. His conduits for radicalism was Alex Howie.
At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, there were attempts to co-ordinate the activities of London Freedom Group, the APCF and the United Socialist Movement which ushered in the creation of "Fighting Call", edited by Leech. But a number of disagreements with its secretary Guy Aldred and one of its leading members, Jenny Patrick lead to a feud and Leech's departure to the Glasgow Anarchist Communist Federation, later to become Anarchist Federation of Britain. During this time he would work closely with Vernon Richards publication - "Spain and the World". [http://libcom.org/history/leech-frank-1900-1953]
In 1937 he gave shelter to a number of anarchists of the Schwarzrotgruppe (a group advocating the assassination of Adolf Hitler), fleeing Nazi Germany after a foiled plot to end the Führer's life. It was Leech's initiative which formed the Glasgow Anarchist-Communist Federation in the same year. [http://www.af-north.org/shipway/shipway%20chapter%208.htm]
War Resistance.
During the Second World War Frank Leech was one of many Glasgow Anarchists who made attempts to resist various aspects of the war such as conscription.
Participation in Air Raid Precautions and compulsory fire-watching schemes was deprecated by Glasgow Anarchists. As British Anarchist Federation member Eddie Fenwick explained when prosecuted for refusing to fire watch at his workplace, since the ""owners of private property had denied him the elementary rights of man, he was entitled to refuse to protect private property.""
When Leech was fined for refusing to comply with the fire watching regulations, and then imprisoned after declining to pay, he went on hunger strike in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, explaining afterwards that he would not ""be used by any ruling class in their wars ... I am determined that our dictators will only conscript my dead body. Not whilst there is breath in it will I submit to them."" After going without food for 17 days Leech was released when friends paid his fine. [http://www.af-north.org/shipway/shipway%20chapter%208.htm]
In August 1940 four members of the Glasgow Anarchist Federation - James Kennedy, Frank Dorans, Eddie Shaw and Frank Leech - were prosecuted for allegedly inciting people to evade liabilities relating to conscription laid down in the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939. The basis of the charge was that they had advertised the offer of information and advice for prospective conscientious objectors, and had held mock tribunals to help COs prepare their cases. The four defendants were found not guilty, however, since in the judge's opinion their actions had not amounted to incitement.[http://www.af-north.org/shipway/shipway%20chapter%208.htm]
One of the foremeost methods of war resistance advocated by Leech and the APFC was that similar to modern conscientious objector status. Since, however, as a rule, the anti-parliamentarians did not conceal their willingness to fight in the class war, in many cases they failed to satisfy the Tribunals' frequent requirement that applicants should demonstrate conscientious objection to all warfare. Once the process of Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal had been exhausted, unsuccessful COs were required to undergo medical examination before being enlisted. Refusal to submit to examination was a criminal offence. In April 1944 Frank Leech reported that ""Dozens of our members have served twelve months sentences for refusing M.E. Examination.""

HZ (character encoding)

The HZ character encoding is an encoding of GB2312 that was formerly commonly used in email and USENET postings. It was designed in 1989 by Fung Fung Lee () of Stanford University, and subsequently codified in 1995 into RFC 1843.
The HZ, short for "Hanzi" (), encoding was invented to facilitate the use of Chinese characters through e-mail, which at that time only allowed 7-bit characters. Therefore, in lieu of standard ISO 2022 escape sequences (as in the case of ISO-2022-JP) or 8-bit characters (as in the case of EUC), the HZ code uses only printable, 7-bit characters to represent Chinese characters.
It was also popular in USENET networks, which in the late 1980s and early 1990s, generally did not allow transmission of 8-bit characters or escape characters.
Structure and use.
In the HZ encoding system, the character sequences "~{" and "~}" act as escape sequences; anything between them is interpreted as Chinese encoded in GB2312 (the most significant bits are ignored). Outside the escape sequences, characters are assumed to be ASCII.
An example will help illustrate the relationship between GB2312, EUC-CN, and the HZ code:
HZ was originally designed to be used purely as a 7-bit code. However, when situations allow, the escape sequences "~{" and "~}" sometimes surround characters represented in EUC-CN; this alternative use allows Chinese to be readable either with the help of HZ decoder software, or with a system that understands EUC-CN.
Additionally, the specification defines that
However, not all HZ decoders follow these two rules.
HZ decoders.
The first HZ decoder was written in 1989 by the code's inventor for the Unix operating system. 
The hztty program, also for the Unix operating system, was also among the first and one of the most popular HZ decoders. It deviates from the specification in that it will display the escape sequences (i.e., "~{" and "~}"), and it does not treat "~~" and "~" followed by a newline specially. This was probably to allow software which assumes one character to occupy one screen position (on a text screen) to function correctly without modification.
Support on Microsoft Windows came later, and a number of third-party "Chinese systems" support HZ. These systems may provide an option to hide the escape sequences.

Battle Ground Academy

Battle Ground Academy (BGA) is an independent college-preparatory school for grades K-12. BGA is located in Franklin, Tennessee, USA. Founded in 1889, the school was originally located in part on the site of the Battle of Franklin in the U.S. Civil War. BGA has two campuses. The Harpeth Campus is located on Franklin Road and is home to Grades K-4. The Glen Echo campus is located off Mack Hatcher Parkway and is home to Grades 5-12.
History.
Battle Ground Academy was established in 1889, and it was named for its original location during the Civil War Battle of Franklin.
The first campus was erected at the corner of Columbia Avenue and Cleburne Street. S.V. Wall and W.D. Mooney were chosen as the first to lead the new academy. In 1902, the original school building burned at which time the school was relocated to Columbia Avenue in Franklin. 
BGA was established to educate boys originally and girls began to attend some time later. The school operated as a day school though students came from outside the local area to attend. They boarded in private homes until the first dormitory was built in 1922. At this time, BGA evolved to become a boarding and day school. 
After the construction of the first dormitory, the decision was made to change to an all-male student body. The departure of the last girl students in 1929 ushered in a half-century when BGA was a boys' school.
In the early 1970s, the boarding program was phased out. BGA once again welcomed girls to its student body. At present, the female enrollment accounts for approximately 50 percent of the student body. 
In 1996, the location of the Battle Ground Academy Upper School changed to the current site on Ernest Rice Lane (off of Mack Hatcher Parkway). In 2003, the Middle School joined the Upper School on the Glen Echo campus and began to enjoy the benefits of the brand new state-of-the-art facilities. Additionally, in 1998, Battle Ground Academy acquired the former Harpeth Academy. This became the BGA Lower School on Franklin Road. Currently, the school operates with two physical campuses and has three divisions: Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School.
Traditions.
BGA has long-standing traditions including the Honor Code, the Greer and Plato societies, and the "Tug".
George I. Briggs, Headmaster from 1925 through 1944, formed two literary societies at BGA in 1925. One of the aforementioned societies was the Greers (in honor of Greer "Daddy" Peoples). The other society was the called the Platos in honor of the Greek philosopher. After many years of competition in sports and debates, the Greers and Platos societies engaged in their first tug-of-war in 1935. 
In the high school "Tug", a rope is stretched across the Harpeth River with the Greers on one side and the Platos on the other. The senior representative from the team who wins the most points in year-long competition -including daily assembly trivia question, faculty and student quiz bowl, debate, community service drives, arm wrestling, and others- chooses which side of the river will be their tug-of-war position. This longstanding tradition still generates much enthusiasm to this day. 
Student Honors.
The BGA Artist Guild was established in 1987 after two senior art students approached the drama and art teachers to request that a group be formed to recognize student achievement in arts. The organization started small and met a couple of times each quarter for fun. As the Guild grew in size and prestige, the group began to have public performances. Guild Night has become a tradition for parents and students each year. The Artist Guild allows BGA to encourage, recognize and nurture excellence in arts.
Board of Trust Merit Scholarships are provided to some of BGA's most promising incoming freshmen. This scholarship program was established in 2005 to recognize outstanding academic performance.
Digamma is an in-school honor society. Members are BGA students who are sophomores, juniors or seniors having a cumulative academic GPA of 3.1. These students have no grade below 87 for the previous semester in any academic subject, have been enrolled in BGA for two full semesters, and have had no honor offenses. Digamma members are not required to attend study hall.

Tor Aulin (Stockholm, 10 September 1866 – Saltsjöbaden, 1 March 1914) was a Swedish violinist, conductor and composer.
Biography.
Aulin studied music at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm (1877-1883) and then in the Conservatory of Berlin (1884-1886) with Émile Sauret and Philipp Scharwenka. From 1889 to 1892 Aulin served as concertmaster of the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. He went on to conduct the principal symphony orchestras of Stockholm and Gothenburg. In 1887 he formed the Aulin Quartet, the first full-time professional quartet in Sweden. It gained an excellent reputation. It disbanded in 1912. Along with Wilhelm Stenhammar, Aulin spearheaded a revival in interest in the work of Franz Berwald, and as soloist he premiered some of Stenhammar's works for violin and orchestra.
Aulin composed a number of orchestral and chamber music works, including a violin sonata, three violin concertos, an orchestral suite, and many small pieces for the violin.
His sister, Laura Valborg Aulin (1860-1928) was a pianist and composer whose output contained two string quartets, in F major and E minor, among other works. His grandson, Tor Aulin, was a communication theory researcher at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and is one of the principal investigators of continuous phase modulation (CPM).

Gornemant

Gornemant was Percival's mentor in Arthurian legend. He is mentioned in a few early romances, but achieves prominence in Chrétien de Troyes' "Perceval, the Story of the Grail", where he instructs the young hero in the ways of knighthood. Percival is a quick learner when it comes to combat, but he does not know how to behave like a knight, so Gornemant tells him not to ask so many of his naive questions, hoping to make the boy look like less of a Welsh hick. This has grave implications later when Percival takes the advice too much to heart and refrains from asking the Fisher King about the Grail.
Gornemant's niece is Blanchefleur, whom Percival later marries after successfully defending her city against attackers.
This character became famous as Gurnemanz in Richard Wagner's opera "Parsifal", in which he is one of the main Grail Knights.

<doc id="2845235" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845235" title="Micromation">
Micromation

Micromation Inc. was as an early pioneer (1978–1983) in the design, manufacture and sale of microcomputer systems, circuit boards and peripherals. The company's products were built around early Intel and Zilog microprocessors, the S-100 bus and the CP/M and MP/M Operating System software from Digital Research. Micromation's headquarters and manufacturing plant were both located in San Francisco. 
Unlike other computer companies of the same era, Micromation's products were targeted primarily at business users rather than hobbyists or consumers. The systems could be used to run a wide variety of software applications including the popular WordStar word processing program from Micropro and many other programs available for the CP/M and MP/M operating systems.
The company built some of the first multi-user computer systems based on microprocessor technology and supported as many as 16 CRT terminals for users. A unique feature of Micromation systems was that they were also "multi-processor", meaning that a single system could contain as many as 16 separate CPUs, one for each user. This allowed the system to support multiple users without sacrificing performance. Most other multi-user systems of the day used a single CPU to run applications for multiple users which resulted in lower performance.
Micromation built and sold thousands of computer systems in the U.S, Canada, Europe, South America and Australia before going out of business in 1985. Like most of the early microcomputer companies, Micromation was not able adapt to the changing marketplace following the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981.
History.
Micromation was founded in 1977 by Ben Cooper, an electronic engineer and former officer in the U.S. Navy. The company's headquarters were located in downtown San Francisco and manufacturing was located in the South of Market area of the city.
Micromation's first major product was an S-100 bus floppy disk controller card called the "Doubler", named for its ability to record information on 8" floppy diskettes at twice the bit density previously available, allowing users to store approximately 256 kilobytes of data on each side of an 8" diskette instead of 128 kilobytes.
While the Doubler board was successful with hobbyists building and supporting their own S-100 computers, Micromation began to focus on building complete S-100 computer systems. The first full system was called the Z-Plus or Z-System, and affectionately become known as "The Coffin Computer" due its finished wooden sides and elongated shape.
Micromation was an early OEM supplier to Zendex Corporation of a single board implementation of the Intel SBC-202 Double Density MMFM Floppy Disk Controller in 1980. This disk controller was the only Multibus-I product made by Micromation. Zendex wholesaled hundreds of the Micromation boards in the Zendex Development Systems and wrote a User Manual and added quality assurance and customer support for retail customers under the Zendex model number ZX-200. Zendex later reverse engineered the product and began second sourcing itself just as Micromation discontinued the product to focus on S-100 systems.
The M/System, Mariner and MiSystem models followed, all of which were multi-user, multi-processor business computers which ran a Micromation-modified version of Digital Research's MP/M operating system.

<doc id="2845254" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845254" title="Nitrosonium">
Nitrosonium

The nitrosonium ion is NO+, in which the nitrogen atom is bonded to an oxygen atom with a bond order of 3, and the overall diatomic species bears a positive charge. This ion is usually obtained as the following salts: NOClO4, NOSO4H (nitrosylsulfuric acid, more descriptively written ONSO3OH), and NOBF4. The ClO and BF salts are slightly soluble in CH3CN. NOBF4 can be purified by sublimation at 200–250 °C and .
NO+ is isoelectronic with CO and N2. It arises via protonation of nitrous acid:
Chemical Properties.
Hydrolysis.
NO+ reacts readily with water to form nitrous acid:
For this reason, NOBF4 must be protected from water or even moist air. With base, the reaction generates nitrite:
As a diazotizing agent.
NO+ reacts with aryl amines, ArNH2, to give diazonium salts, ArN. The resulting diazonium group is easily displaced (unlike the amino group) by a variety of nucleophiles.
As an oxidizing agent.
NO+, e.g. as NOBF4, is a strong oxidizing agent:
NOBF4 is a convenient oxidant because the byproduct NO is a gas, which can be swept from the reaction using a stream of N2. Upon contact with air, NO forms NO2, which can cause secondary reactions if it is not removed. NO2 is readily detectable by its characteristic orange color.
Nitrosylation of arenes.
Electron-rich arenes are nitrosylated using NOBF4. One example involves anisole:
Nitrosonium, NO+, is sometimes confused with nitronium, NO2+, the active agent in nitrations. These species are quite different, however. Nitronium is a more potent electrophile than is nitrosonium, as anticipated by the fact that the former is derived from a strong acid (nitric acid) and the latter from a weak acid (nitrous acid).
As a source of NO complexes.
NOBF4 reacts with some metal carbonyl complexes to yield related metal nitrosyl complexes. One must be careful that + is transferred vs. electron transfer (see above).

Dharma Initiative

The Dharma Initiative, also written DHARMA (Department of Heuristics and Research on Material Applications), is a fictional research project featured in the television series "Lost". It was introduced in the second season episode "Orientation". In 2008, the Dharma Initiative website was launched. Dharma's interests were directly connected with fringe science. "Dharma" is a Sanskrit term used in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The logo is a circle with the word "dharma" inside, all inscribed inside a bagua.
Background.
The Dharma Initiative and its origins are first explored in the episode "Orientation" by an orientation film in the . Dr. Marvin Candle (Francois Chau), explains that the project began in 1970, created by two doctoral candidates from the University of Michigan, Gerald and Karen DeGroot (Michael Gilday and Courtney Lavigne), and was funded by Alvar Hanso (Ian Patrick Williams) of the Hanso Foundation. They imagined a "large-scale communal research compound", where scientists and free thinkers from around the globe could research meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism, and a sixth discipline that the film begins to identify as "utopian social-" before being cut off.
The episodes "LaFleur" and "He's Our You" indicate that mathematician Horace Goodspeed was in charge of Dharma Initiative operations on the Island, at least from the very early 1970s through the time of "the Incident". Key decisions that needed to be made on the Island were taken by a committee, which included all department heads, including Head of Research Stuart Radzinsky and security head LaFleur (the name the time-traveling Sawyer was assuming). They, in turn, answer to the Dharma Initiative HQ based at the University of Michigan, as evidenced when Radzinsky threatens to call the University to override a key decision by Goodspeed. In the episode "The Variable", Daniel Faraday confirmed that Dharma Initiative Headquarters, at least through 1977, was located at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The "Lost Experience", an alternate reality game which took place in 2006, revealed that the objective of the Dharma Initiative was to alter any of the six factors of the Valenzetti Equation, an equation which "predicts the exact number of years and months until humanity extinguishes itself," to allow humans to exist for longer by changing their doomsday. These factors are represented as numbers in the Valenzetti Equation and are also the numbers frequently mentioned in the show: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.
In 1977, the Dharma workers based on the Island drilled into an electromagnetic pocket, releasing a catastrophically dangerous amount of electromagnetic energy. This is referred to as "the Incident" and is frequently alluded to in other Dharma Initiative sources. Radzinsky insisted on drilling despite warnings from Dr. Chang about the danger. In the Swan Station orientation film, recorded in 1980, Dr. Marvin Candle insists that the computer at the Swan Station not be used for any other purpose, specifically to communicate with other stations. When the Oceanic 815 survivors travel back in time to 1977, they attempt to negate the release of this energy by detonating the plutonium core of a hydrogen bomb, causing a massive explosion that returns all of the time travelers back to 2007. The future remains unchanged, supporting Miles' assertion that the bomb is the very cause of the Incident. The actions of the survivors in the past cause a temporal causality loop, in which their own actions in the past were in fact the cause of the events of the future.
After the Incident, according to notes on the blast door map painted by Stuart Radzinsky in the Swan Station, the Dharma Initiative's facilities on the Island seemed to fall into disrepair. The blast door map has been annotated about destroyed access tunnels, a breakdown in the Cerberus Security System and mentions facilities being abandoned or destroyed via other incidents or accidents, specifically one happening on October 28, 1984, another in 1985, and a final one on December 7, 1987. By the time Danielle Rousseau and her crew shipwrecked on the Island, in 1988, many of the facilities on the Island had been abandoned, including the radio tower. At no point between then and the eventual purge of its members did the Dharma Initiative attempt a search and rescue for Danielle or her crew, despite Danielle broadcasting her own distress signal on a continuous loop from the tower for sixteen years.
When the Dharma Initiative arrived on the Island, they fought with the Island's natives, known to them as the Hostiles and to the survivors of Flight 815 as the "Others". The "Hostiles" had been living on the Island long before the Initiative arrived. The Arrow Station was eventually given a mission to observe and formulate strategies to counter the Hostiles. When Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) arrived on the Island in 1970, there was still an open conflict between the Hostiles and the Dharma Initiative. At some point prior to 1974, a truce of some kind was brokered with the Hostiles. A series of protocols were put into place between the Hostiles and the Initiative. Several episodes mention that there was a "line" and that certain parts of the Island were considered to be the "territory" of each group. This conflict ended in 1992, when Linus joined the Hostiles, who killed the Initiative, an event which became known as "The Purge". The bodies were buried in a mass grave.
In 2001, after Stuart Radzinsky's alleged suicide in The Swan, Kelvin Inman, a man who found Desmond adrift on the beach, was still working for the Dharma Initiative in the Swan station. "Lost" producer Carlton Cuse confirms in a podcast that Kelvin was indeed a member of the Dharma Initiative. In the "Lost Experience", an actor portraying fictional Hanso Foundation executive Hugh McIntyre appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stated that the Foundation had stopped funding the Dharma Initiative in 1987. However, in season 2, an air drop of supplies arrived for the Swan station. This drop was made by a drone launched from the Dharma Logistics Warehouse located on the Orote Peninsula on the island of Guam. Two of the last known living members of the Dharma Initiative, known only as Hector and Glenn, had been sending regular supply drops to The Island for over twenty years. This indicates a financial structure had been left in place by the Hanso Foundation, hinted to in the Sri Lanka video, to pay the two workers and keep them supplied with packaged foodstuffs and equipment sufficient to continue sending pallets to The Island in perpetuity. They were regularly given the coordinates of The Island via a teletype link to the still-working Lamp Post station, allowing them to program the drones with the exact drop locations for their cargo. In the epilogue short video "The New Man in Charge", Ben Linus arrives at the warehouse and, after answering Hector and Glenn's questions, shuts it down, correctly telling the Dharma workers that there's a new man in charge (Hurley) and their work is no longer needed (as people are now allowed to leave The Island).
At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, a new ARG began with a booth recruiting new members to the Initiative. At the "Lost" panel, Hans van Eeghen, a Dharma executive, revealed that the results from the booth were "abysmal", and a few people had been selected to view a video that had been sent from thirty years in the past. In the video, Pierre Chang said that the work on the Island is valid, and it is essential that the Dharma Initiative is restarted. Following this a website was launched, which allowed users to join the Dharma Initiative.
Research stations.
The Dharma Initiative placed nine known research stations around the Island (as well as the off-island Lamp Post), most of which take the form of hidden underground facilities or bunkers. After Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on the Island in September 2004, the survivors encounter several of these stations. The first to be discovered is "The Swan" which they refer to informally as "the hatch". Nine additional stations have since been visited over the series, each with its own particular logo associated with it: an octagon, similar to the bagua design, with a differing symbol at the center.
On the blast door map, there are 6 structures depicted, and at least 4 of them are labeled by name and icon like DHARMA stations: The Swan, The Flame, The Staff and The Arrow. The other structures are labeled by question marks or numbers. Two of the alleged stations are drawn with dotted lines. The 6 structures all surround a big circled question mark in the center of the map. At the top left, there is another structure (a 7th structure) which is scribbled out. The Swan Station's blast door map makes reference to a light manufacturing facility, a meteorological research station, station "CVII", and others that were never shown on the series.
Among the hatches on the southeast side of the map, there are 4 rectangular structures/labels that have "CVI","CVII","CVIII", and "CVIV" written on them. CV stands for Cerberus Vent, which was revealed in secret writing on the back of one of the Lost jigsaw puzzles. The Swan station's blast door map claims that there was, at one time, an underground tunnel network that connected many of the stations. Notations on the map suggest that the tunnels started falling into disrepair in the early 1980s, soon after the incident occurred.
Station 1: The Hydra.
The Hydra is a zoological research station located on a small island roughly two miles off-shore from the main island. It is described as being about twice the size of Alcatraz Island. The Hydra facility has cages outside the station in the jungle where polar bears used to be kept. An underwater complex was once used as an aquarium, which housed sharks and dolphins. The facility also features living and research quarters. The symbol for this station is the usual Dharma Initiative logo with a hydra in the middle, which can be seen on a large canopy behind Kate and Sawyer's cages in season 3.
At the start of season three, Jack, Kate, and Sawyer are held captive on the Hydra island by the Others. Kate and Sawyer are forced to build a runway, until they manage to escape. In season two, a shark has the Dharma symbol branded on its tail. Also in season three episode "A Tale of Two Cities", Tom comments that the polar bears that used to be housed in the cage Sawyer was being held in figured out the "food" puzzle in two hours. A leather collar bearing the Dharma Hydra symbol is found near a polar bear skeleton in the Tunisian desert. In the fifth season, Ajira Airways Flight 316 makes a forced but overall safe landing on the Hydra island, landing on the runway built by the Others. In the fifth season episode "Some Like It Hoth", Dr. Chang threatens to send an over-inquisitive Hurley to the Hydra Station to participate in their "ridiculous experiments" if he mentions a body delivered to Dr. Chang by Miles Straume.
Station 2: The Arrow.
The Arrow station is first seen in "...And Found". In "Because You Left", a flashback shows Chang doing the initial recording for the orientation film, where he explains that it is a station for monitoring the Hostiles and formulating strategies to combat them. He is interrupted before he can finish. In "The Man Behind the Curtain", flashbacks of the Dharma Initiative in operation on the Island show one of the members, Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), wearing a jumpsuit bearing the Arrow station logo with "mathematician" written below it. When rediscovered in 2004, the word "quarantine" appears on the inside of the station's door. In "LaFleur", Horace gives the order to notify the Arrow to "prepare the heavy ordnance" when he believes there is an imminent danger from the Hostiles.
When the tail section survivors come across the Arrow Station in "The Other 48 Days", it has apparently been converted into a storage room. Within, they find a radio, a glass eye, and part of the Swan station's orientation film hidden inside a Bible. Producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof stated on a podcast that each object is significant, and not randomly chosen.
Station 3: The Swan.
The Swan was planned to be a laboratory used by the Dharma Initiative for research on electromagnetism. In the episode "The Incident", Dharma Initiative member Radzinsky claimed when complete, the Swan Station would allow manipulation of electromagnetism that "would change the world". According to the feature "Access Granted" on the third season Blu-ray, Dharma drilled into the earth and hit an area containing a large electromagnetic buildup, which their drilling released. The Swan was built over this area to act as a cork. Dharma then came up with a scheme to "dam" the leak but with the drawback that the field built up behind the dam and would eventually break it. A failsafe key could be used to permanently "seal" the leak. The specific event happened in July 1977, as revealed in "The Incident", and necessitated the evacuation of the island.
On the station's orientation film, Doctor Marvin Candle explains that an "incident" occurred early in the station's experiments. An edit to the film, which according to Inman was made by Radzinsky, removed specific details of this incident. This event required the entire Swan station area to be sealed with a large amount of concrete "like Chernobyl" (according to Sayid and Daniel Faraday) to contain the dangerous energy. This caused a consistent build-up of electromagnetic energy, which resulted in a change of the station's focus: a two-member crew, replaced every 540 days, were instructed to enter a numeric code into a microcomputer terminal every 108 minutes. The station is equipped with a split-flap display timer, which is interfaced to a microcomputer terminal and connected to an alarm system.
The station is stocked with food, a record player with a collection of old LPs, a small library, an armory, a shower, and bunk beds. There is also a brand new washer/dryer and one of the books in the library is "Rainbow Six" by Tom Clancy, published in 1998. It is almost entirely underground, except for an entrance shaft and a concealed door (possibly due to being hidden in the Hostiles territory). The station also has several internal blast doors, with a map in invisible ink on one of them. This map has been worked on by, at a minimum, Kelvin Inman and Radzinsky. Analysis of the map suggests no less than five unique handwriting styles, and thus five different contributors. The map has direct revision dates on it, and as well as the obvious map entry, also seems to serve as some sort of history to happenings on the island, as there are many annotations that seem to suggest the writers were attempting to locate and ascertain the status of many stations on the Island. There are sections that are written in Latin. Kelvin Inman is seen writing in the lower right hand part of the map in "Live Together, Die Alone", near a revision dated for 6.26.2002. There are also acrylic based paints and several murals painted in different portions of the hatch by unknown people as well as tick marks on the wall derived from them.
In the episode "Some Like It Hoth", set in 1977, the Swan Station is shown to be under construction in an area designated as the Hostiles' territory, a violation of the truce Dharma had brokered with them, under the primary authority of Radzinsky. In the episode "The Incident", Dharma hits the pocket, releasing the energy and drawing all metallic objects into the hole. The plutonium core of a hydrogen bomb is detonated by the survivors in an attempt to negate the energy. In "Live Together, Die Alone", Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) shipwrecks on the Island in 2001 and is taken to the Swan station. Here Kelvin Inman explains about entering the numeric code then pushing the button to save the world. In September 2004, Kelvin and Desmond get into a fight, resulting in Kelvin's death. Desmond enters the numbers too late, resulting in an electromagnetic build-up, which causes the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Two of the survivors, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Boone (Ian Somerhalder), discover the Swan accidentally. Locke manages to successfully open it in the first season finale "Exodus". Inside they find Desmond, who flees after they break the computer. The survivors manage to fix the computer, and begin pushing the button every 108 minutes.
After discovering the Pearl orientation film, Locke believes pushing the button is a psychological test, and with Desmond's help decides to find out what will happen if the button is not pushed. Desmond tries to convince Locke that the station is real, with data from the Pearl, but Locke breaks the computer anyway so he can't stop the countdown. This causes all the metal objects in the Swan to fly about, and the ground begins to shake. Realizing the importance of the button Locke accepts he was wrong, and Desmond turns the failsafe key. The sky turns violet temporarily, and the Swan is destroyed. The electromagnetic burst released by the destruction of the Swan Station renders the island momentarily visible to the outside world. The energy signature is detected by a monitoring station under the control of Penelope Widmore, which reported to her that they had "found it."
The Incident Room.
In the video game "", the Incident Room is the abandoned laboratory revealed to be on the other side of the concrete wall in the Swan. The room was accessed by a tunnel and a large locked door. The room contains a large reactor and other severely damaged equipment. The reactor is tilted to one side and discharging electricity as well as coolant fluid. It has the appearance of two large electromagnetic coils suspended over a drilled shaft into the Island surrounded by severely damaged concrete. The Incident Room has its own computer much like the Swan's. This section of the Swan appeared on the blast door map as a blocked off section of the station ("Lockdown"), but was never seen in the show itself.
The Incident Room has been mentioned several times in Lost. When Sayid first visited the Swan he tried to find a way past the concrete wall, but it was just too thick to get through. Sayid told Jack that "The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl", ("Everybody Hates Hugo").
The look and design for the "Incident Room" came from never before seen blueprints given to the developers by the Lost crew for the game. Although the game has been stated to be non-canon, the designs are the creators' intended layout for the blocked sections of the Swan station.
Station 4: The Flame.
The Flame is the Dharma Initiative's communication station. It uses sonar and satellite technologies to communicate with the outside world and other stations on the Island, and can also be used to order food deliveries. Unlike the other stations, the Flame is not an underground bunker, but rather a wood-frame bungalow with a large satellite dish on the roof. Inside the station is a living area, a kitchen, and a computer room. Below the building is a large basement containing supplies, including a library of Dharma Initiative operations manuals. The facility also boasts several gardens, as well as chickens, cows, and goats roaming the area.
On the day Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on the Island, Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) uses the station to access news feeds to gather information about the survivors. At Ben's request he alters one of the feeds to allow Juliet to see her sister and nephew alive and well off the Island. At some point after this, communication off the Island is no longer possible, as the is blocking all signals. In "Enter 77", Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), and Locke discover the station. Locke uses the computer to send a message saying the Hostiles have invaded the station, and by doing so he intentionally destroys it by causing the C4 lining the basement to go off. As shown in "LaFleur", Radzinsky was stationed at the Flame in 1977, where he designed the model for the future Swan Station.
Station 5: The Pearl.
The Pearl is where the Dharma Initiative studied psychology. It primarily serves as a monitoring station, to which surveillance feeds from the other stations are sent. Its orientation film asserts that the Swan is a psychological experiment, and that the purpose of those stationed in the Pearl is to monitor the participants in that station. The station consists of a three-by-three bank of television sets, two chairs with writing surfaces, and a computer hooked to a printer. A pneumatic tube is installed in the room, which the orientation film states is used to transport notebooks to another Dharma location. According to the orientation film that features Dr Mark Whickman, two-person teams, working eight-hour shifts over a three-week period, were to watch the video displays and take notes on their observations. Every action, regardless of how subtle, were to be recorded into notebooks by the Pearl's team members.
After Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on the Island, Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro) are the first survivors to encounter the Pearl, while searching for diamonds. Several weeks later, Locke and Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) enter the Pearl and watch the orientation video. Locke believes this means pushing the button in the Swan is a psychological test, and resolves to discover what will happen if it is not pushed. However, Desmond postulates in "Live Together, Die Alone" that the Pearl participants were the true test subjects without knowing it. This is supported when the survivors discover that the pneumatic tube dumps the notebooks into an open field; the contents of the notebooks indicate that they had been dumped there long before the station closed. During season three, some of the survivors visit the Pearl in hope of finding a way to communicate with the Others, but discover that the station is only capable of receiving data, not sending it.
Station 6: The Orchid.
Introduced in the three-part finale of the fourth season, "There's No Place Like Home", the Orchid station appears at first to be an abandoned greenhouse. Hidden below the greenhouse is a second level of the station, a furnished laboratory similar to the Swan station. The Orchid features a small chamber adjacent to an exotic matter anomaly, which can be used to warp time and space. An outtake from the orientation film was shown at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, where Doctor Edgar Halliwax explains that, contrary to Dharma's statements that the station was for botanical research, the station is used for researching a "Casimir effect" exhibited by the Island. The producers have confirmed that the video is canon, and holds relevance to the show itself.
Below the Orchid station is a room which consists of pillars and stones with unknown hieroglyphs that have been seen in a few other places on the Island, and ends with a room consisting of a giant frozen wheel built horizontally into the wall. As shown in "This Place is Death", the chamber was in place well before the construction of the Orchid. A well was connected to it at one point before the Orchid was built, but the chamber itself predates it. Despite being under the Orchid, it has nothing to do with the DHARMA Initiative, nor did any member of DHARMA ever set foot in the room or touch the wheel. Ben and Locke enter the station and Ben travels to this room, where he turns the wheel. As he pushes it, the gap containing the wheel glows and the Island vanishes. Ben is transported to the Tunisian Desert as a consequence of using it. As a result of turning the wheel, the survivors of Flight 815 and the freighter crew members on the Island (who are all candidates to replace Jacob) begin to jump randomly through time. When Locke returns to the wheel in "This Place is Death", it is shown to be bouncing erratically and still glowing. Locke turns the wheel back to its original position, transporting himself off the Island to the same place Ben ended up. The time jumps also stop, stranding the survivors in 1974. Charles Widmore would later tell Locke that the Tunisian Desert is the "exit point" for anyone who uses the wheel.
In a flashback in "Because You Left", Dr. Chang is called to investigate an incident at the Orchid. A construction worker is shown bleeding from his eyes and mouth, and six drill bits have been melted drilling into the future site of the chamber. Scans of the wall reveal the presence of the chamber with the wheel behind it. Chang refuses to use explosives to clear the wall, since it might release a limitless energy source. He believes that they will be able to control time if the energy can be harnessed properly.
Station ?: The Staff.
The Staff is a medical research station, later designed to house pregnant women who were taken there to give birth and/or die. It consists of a long corridor, at the end of which is an operating room, as well as a nursery and a locker room. Hidden inside one of the lockers is a switch that unlocks a hidden vault that contains medical equipment and nursery furniture. There is also another hidden room, where the Others take women who have become pregnant on the Island to die.
After Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Others in season one, she is taken to the Staff station. Here she has a drug administered to her fetus. A renegade Other, Alex (Tania Raymonde), helps Claire to escape when she learns that they are planning to steal Claire's baby. When it is found by Claire and Kate later on, Kate discovers costumes, a fake beard, and some theatrical glue in the Staff locker room. In season three, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) visit the Staff station to perform an ultrasound to discover when Sun's baby was conceived. In season four, Faraday, Charlotte, Jin and Sun visit the station to get some medical supplies for Jack's operation.
Station ?: The Looking Glass.
The Looking Glass is located on the sea-bed at approximately 60 feet (18m) depth, some 600 feet (182m) from the beach. The station is used to jam communications going to and from the Island, as well as generating a beacon to guide the submarine to the Island. When the Dharma Initiative was still active, the Looking Glass was used to resupply the submarine. The station receives power from the cable that Sayid discovered in the episode "Solitary". The station's logo is a rabbit, a reference to the White Rabbit from "Alice in Wonderland" (the sequel to which is "Through the Looking-Glass"). Its logo can be seen in the episode "Greatest Hits" when Charlie swims down to it. The Others were under the impression that the station was flooded. Only Ben knew that the station was still in operation and there were people working there.
In the season three finale, "Through the Looking Glass", Charlie Pace discovers that the rescue boat linked to Naomi, the parachute woman, was not sent out by Desmond Hume's ex-girlfriend Penny Widmore. Charlie locks the door to the control room when Mikhail shatters the porthole window, subsequently flooding the room. This prevents Desmond from getting to Charlie, thereby fulfilling Desmond's latest "premonition" (Charlie was meant to drown in the control room after disabling the jamming equipment). He quickly writes "Not Penny's Boat" on his hand and shows Desmond through the glass on the door.
Station ?: The Tempest.
The Tempest is a chemical weapons development station on the Island, first seen in the episode "The Other Woman". It is used to control the release of poisonous gases over the Island. In "The Other Woman", it was revealed that part of Daniel Faraday's and Charlotte Lewis' primary missions were to disable the gases at the station. They said they needed to press the button to save everyone, although they may have wanted to disable the station's gases to prevent Benjamin Linus from using the Tempest as a weapon of last resort against the Island's enemies.
The station's name is a reference to "The Tempest", the title of one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays. The play concerns a group of flawed and corrupt individuals being shipwrecked on a mysterious island.
Station ?: The Lamp Post.
The Lamp Post is the only known off-island Dharma station. It is located in Los Angeles under a church, built on top of a pocket of electromagnetic energy similar to that on the island. This station was used by the DHARMA Initiative to find the Island. As the island can move and is hard to locate, the researchers developed an equation to predict where the island would be in the future, thereby providing a window of opportunity to reach it. A large pendulum (resembling a Foucault pendulum) hangs from the ceiling making chalk marks on a map on the floor beneath, making a pattern with lines crossing a central point from almost every direction except up and down. Many computers surround the pendulum, along with a panel on the wall that marks latitude and longitude. The inside of the station first appears in the second episode of season five, "The Lie", though no explanation of its purpose (or that it is, in fact, a DHARMA station) is revealed until the following episode, "316". The computers also seem to be able to find data regarding the Island, for example how long the people who left the Island have to return before an unspecified catastrophe occurs (70 hours). It is unknown how this data is calculated or received. Eloise Hawking is currently in charge of the station, and uses it to help the Oceanic 6 return to the island with the assistance of Ben Linus.
The station's logo includes the traditional Dharma octagon-shape with a picture of what appears to be a lamp post emitting light to either side. This picture can also refer to the pendulum within the station as evidenced by the pointed tip in the picture.
Mysteries of the Universe.
Starting on July 23, 2009, ABC's official "Lost" website started posting a 5 part documentary from lost footage from a short-lived 1980s television series "Mysteries of the Universe". The brand and its episodes were created by ABC and the Lost team in 2009 as a promotion for the final season of the show. A documentary series with a similar name was made in the 1980s, which may provide documentary with an appearance of being factual - although the presentation contains a healthy dose of humor. The videos contain new revelations about the DHARMA Initiative and the conspiracies that surround it.
Hanso Foundation.
The Hanso Foundation, founded by Danish arms dealer Alvar Hanso, is the major benefactor of the Dharma Initiative. Nearly all information about the Foundation is drawn from its Web site, thehansofoundation.org, with further background revealed as part of the alternate reality game, the Lost Experience.
During the Lost Experience, documents and other information were released to suggest that the management of the Foundation was scandalous and, in some cases, criminal. For example, some executives were revealed to have falsely reported the extent of their education in their biographies. One executive was caught in an extramarital affair. Others defended tobacco companies, nuclear power plants and an oil company that dumped chemical waste in Florida. Another executive was sentenced to eight years for insider trading which he subsidized through a retirement fund for a health care union.
In popular culture.
In "", players can find an Easter egg in the sixth chapter, "Our Mutual Fiend". In another twist which connects the two media, "Our Mutual Friend" is a book that Desmond was saving to read just before his suicide in the Swan station on "Lost". In Uriah's lab, there is an inaccessible room containing a computer terminal with the numbers shown on the screen and a Dharma-style octagon with a pine tree symbol for the White Forest base on the wall. The room was inserted at the request of Gabe Newell, who promised to insert a reference to "Lost" in response to "Half-Life" references in "Lost"s first season episode "The Greater Good".
In 2009, The Fringemunks released a song called "DHARMA Initiative" (a parody of Culture Club's "Karma Chameleon").
ThinkGeek added a Dharma Initiative Alarm Clock to its product catalog, as one of its 2010 April Fools' Day jokes.

Hasse Walli

Hannes Mikael Waldemar "Hasse" Walli was born on 10 February 1948 in Helsinki. His father Aarno Walli was a musician and bandleader, his mother Anne-Marie Strandberg a singer. Hasse Walli was about ten years old when he started playing drums. He drummed in various bands in early 1960s such as The Islanders, The Electric Five and Nameless. Gradually Walli switched from drums to electric guitar. After Nameless had split, Walli started as a solo guitarist in The Typhoons. The Typhoons split when its members had to join the obligatory military service.
Professional career.
In spring 1966 Walli launched his professional musical career as guitarist when he started playing with Jormas, a band which was extremely popular not only in Finland but in the rest of Scandinavia too. During the seven months Hasse Walli spent in Jormas, they toured expansively Finland, Sweden and Denmark, Walli also appearing on the band's album and singles. Again, Jormas split too when its members had to join military service; Walli finding soon himself doing a brief stint in The Frankies of Johnny Liebkind. However, soon Hasse Walli became frustrated in having to play soft pop, when the rawer sounds of The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (which especially inspired Walli) started to make waves in the mid-60s rock scene. 
With his friend Måns Groundstroem, Edward Vesala (who was not to spend a lot of time in the band) and British expatriate Jim Pembroke, Walli initiated a new band dedicated to this sound, which was baptized Blues Section, and which was to become a groundbreaking act in the whole Finnish rock scene. Another great inspiration to Blues Section was the Jimi Hendrix gig in May 1967 at Kulttuuritalo, Helsinki. Blues Section lasted until the late 1968, during which time Walli recorded with the band their seminal eponymous album, several singles, film music and other material later to be heard on various collection albums, and played over 150 live gigs. During this period Walli also played guitar in the jazz band Otto Donner Treatment, the composer-musician Henrik Otto Donner being the essential and extremely innovative producer figure behind Blues Section and their record label Love Records.
Following the split of Blues Section, Hasse Walli played for some time in the band of light pop singer Tapani Kansa and as a bar musician at the restaurant Fennia. In summer 1969 Walli was planning a new band called Paradise with the former Jormas members Pepe Willberg, Kikke Bergholm and Matti Oiling, which never came into being, though Willberg later on used the name Paradise with his own band. On 31 August 1969 Hasse Walli was involved in a car accident which interrupted his career for a while after when he was returning from a gig. Walli's injured left hand was operated and the guitarist, forced to take a break from playing, spent some time in the bohemian circles of Copenhagen, leading a vagrant life also as a street musician in French Riviera.
After returning to Finland, Hasse Walli played for a while with Kirka & D'Islanders, in a band called Zeus producing Vesa-Matti Loiri's first album "4+20" and collaborating with jazz musician Make Lievonen. Hasse Walli Eternal Band was a jazzy project which worked under different line-ups from 1968 to 1971, playing among all at the first Ruisrock festival of Turku in 1970. Other jazz projects of this period where Walli contributed were Irina Milan & Tabu, Simo Big Band, Carita Holmström's backing band, Paroni Paakkunainen & Unisono and German Heinz Sauer-Günther Lenz Quintet; furthermore, he played with Edward Vesala and Junnu Aaltonen, also at Afrikan Tähti band of pop singer Maarit. Walli's Punainen Lanka ensemble where Eija Ahvo and Harri Saksala sang and which explored folk music of Finland and America, was part of 70s leftist political song movement gaining strong foothold in Finland.
The band Piirpauke, combining folk music, ethnic sounds (later to be known as world music) to progressive jazz rock, was one of Hasse Walli's best-known musical projects, starting in 1975. The major figure in the band was Sakari Kukko, a multi-instrumentalist playing saxophone, flute and keyboards, who had played with Walli in various ensembles, Kukko-Walli Quartet among them. The best known Piirpauke track is the hypnotic 'Konevitsan kirkonkellot' from the band's eponymous 1975 debut album, based on a traditional Karelian folk song. The band had an enormous live success and Hasse Walli stayed in Piirpauke about three years, later returning to the band for its tours in 1983 and 1994. 
In the late 1970s Hasse Walli was active in ELMU, a society established in 1978 to propagate live music in a time when disco and recorded music were worryingly diminishing the working opportunities of musicians playing live. This was also the time when Walli got more and more interested in world music. His enthusiasism for reggae started in 1977 after having seen Bob Marley performing live in Stockholm. Hasse Walli had visited a youth festival in Cuba with Punainen Lanka and Sakari Kukko, and he formed in 1979 Hasse Walli Projekti which played Cuban music and reggae rhythms.
The first eponymous solo album of Hasse Walli was released in 1981, the year when Walli was also chosen the Musician of the Year by "Katso" magazine. The next year, when he had his band Hasse Walli All Stars, saw the second album, called "Sounds Afro!" By this time Walli had seriously gotten into African music, and he dissolved the band and travelled in January 1982 to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, to explore local sounds such as Mbalax, Senegalese pop.
Jamming with local musicians at clubs, Walli practiced hard to get into the heart of this musical style quite differing from the Western genres of rock, blues and jazz he had already learned to master. Hasse Walli played with some musicians who had been performing with the legendary Youssou N'Dour. On returning to Finland and enriched by his experiences in Senegal, Walli started a band called Dakar Sound. Afro-Line was another band of Walli he started with Congolese expatriate Marie-Alphonse Liwata, releasing the albums "Viva Africa" (1983), "Dakar Nights" (1985) and "Close to the Line" (1987). During the years 1983–86 Hasse Walli shuttled between Gambia, Dakar and Finland. 
By 1988 Walli felt he had finally learned enough to compose and arrange Mbalax music and start an all-African band for this (Walli's earlier Afro bands had mostly consisted of Finnish musicians), and he returned to Dakar for this purpose. Soon got together the new band, called Asamaan, with such musicians as Manel Diop, Yamar Thiam, Aladji Oumar Faye, Omar Cheikh Diene, Pape Sarr and Mousse Gueye. The first Asamaan album "Modern Mbalax" came out in 1989, receiving excellent reviews in world music circles. Walli and Asamaan played at folk music, jazz and rock festivals, doing also some street performances in Helsinki. Asamaan published two more albums, "African Sky" (1990) and, with a new line-up, "Teranga" (1993). Film director Kari Happonen documented Mbalax music scene in Dakar and Asamaan in his 1991 documentary "Mbalax! Rytmin lähteillä".
Teranga marked the end of Hasse Walli's Afro period. When he returned from Senegal to Finland in June 1993, he thought the time might be now right to return to his 1960s musical roots, and the band Suuret Setelit was launched, playing rock and rhythm & blues. The gigs of Suuret Setelit were eagerly checked by a completely new generation of Hasse Walli fans. Suuret Setelit lasted until 1995, the year Walli also performed together with Remu Aaltonen, the last remaining member of the legendary 70s band Hurriganes. Hasse Walli also played several Back to the 60s type of concerts with some his peers from that period such as Danny; never forgetting his love of African music, either.
In recent years Walli has been touring with his current band Hasse Walli Power Trio. Additionally, he has worked with guitarist and singer Steve Webb, and they have released two albums together.
Trivia.
Hasse Walli's younger brother was Petri Walli of Kingston Wall.

Ali al-Khudair

Sheikh Ali al-Khudair (, , also known as Sheikh Ali bin al-Khudair, or Ali bin al-Khudayr) is an influential Saudi Arabian Wahhabi cleric and scholar. He was arrested in 2003. He has been called a member of the “al-Shu’aybi school”, named after his teacher, strict Wahhabi cleric Hamoud al-Aqla al-Shuebi.
Before his 2003 arrest.
Sheikh Ali al-Khudair had issued fatwas against several Saudi-Arabian thinkers, among them Turki al-Hamad, Mansour al-Naqeedan and Abdullah Abusamh declaring them as infidel. 
His taped sermons and religious decrees are reported to have influenced many young people in Saudi-Arabia. 
After the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC, he issued a fatwa calling on his followers to rejoice in the attacks and listed American "crimes" that justified the attacks "killing and displacing Muslims, aiding the Muslims' enemies against them, spreading secularism, forcefully imposing blasphemy on peoples and states, and persecuting the mujahideen."
Arrest, 2003, and afterwards.
He was arrested in May 2003 in Madinah, Saudi-Arabia following the May 2003 suicide bombings of residential compounds in Riyadh that killed 34 people. According to Ain-al-Yaqeen he was one of three scholars who had issuing a fatwa `that declared the killing of security personnel during confrontations "halal" or permissible.` Two other scholars arrested were Nasser al-Fahd, and Ahmad Al-Khaledi. 
Days after his arrest, an Islamist Web site posted a message from Osama bin Laden warning the Saudi government not to harm the cleric. Bin Laden described al-Khudair as "our most prominent supporter" and according to "Mohamad Bazzi", cautioned that if he was hurt, Al-Qaeda's response would be "as great as the sheik's high standing with us". 
According to Ain-al-Yaqeen, in November 2003 interview with Saudi television, al-Khudair 
"recanted and condemned the suicide bombings which took place in Riyadh" and withdrew 
the fatwas he had issued declaring Turki al-Hamad, Mansour al-Naqeedan and Abdullah Abusamh infidels.

Gareth Cooper

Gareth Cooper (born 7 May 1979 in Bridgend) is a former Wales international rugby union player who played in the scrum-half position.
Career.
Cooper started playing rugby with Pencoed before moving to Bath in the West Country.
Cooper made his international debut in 2001 against Italy, when many were claiming him to be the successor to Rob Howley. He toured to Japan in later that year. After Howley's retirement in 2002 he was given his first run in the side in 2003, becoming first choice for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. 
He returned to play in Wales after that tournament with the Celtic Warriors, but he found himself scrapping with the ScarletsDwayne Peel for the scrum half jersey during the 2004 Six Nations. 
He joined the Newport Gwent Dragons in 2004 when the Celtic Warriors were disbanded, but his form went downhill and Dwayne Peel secured the scrum half shirt with some stunning performances during Wales' Grand Slam in the 2005 Six Nations. Despite playing mostly on the bench for Wales he was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, but with three other scrum halves on the tour he struggled to get game time as he was last in the pecking order behind Peel, Matt Dawson and Chris Cusiter.
With the emergence of Mike Phillips he struggled to fight for his way into the Wales team as he became a distant third choice. He moved to Gloucester in 2007. 
He made the Wales squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup but still as third choice scrum half and he played just one match as substitute against Japan.
He got another chance for Wales on a tour to South Africa in 2008 when Phillips and Peel both were injured. He impressed in two matches against South Africa and kept his place ahead of Peel and the still injured Phillips for the Autumn internationals that year, including a 21–18 win over Australia. 
He was injured during the 2009 Six Nations but returned to the Wales side for the summer tour to North America. The tour did not go well and he was replaced at half time by Peel against Canada.
He left Gloucester in 2009 after losing his place to Rory Lawson and moved to the Cardiff Blues to replace Jason Spice. He played again for Wales in the 2010 Six Nations against England and Scotland but was replaced by Richie Rees for the remainder of the tournament.
Cardiff Blues announced on 3 November 2010 that he would be leaving the club, due to a long standing groin injury.

<doc id="2845285" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845285" title="VAXELN">
VAXELN

VAXELN is a real-time operating system for the VAX family of computers produced by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts.
As with RSX-11 and VMS, Dave Cutler was the principal force behind the development of this operating system. Cutler's team developed the product after moving to the Seattle, Washington area to form the DECwest Engineering Group, DEC's first engineering group outside New England. Initial target platforms for VAXELN were the "backplane interconnect" computers such as the model code-named Scorpio. At the time there were no VAX microcomputers. When VAXELN was well under way, Cutler spearheaded the next project, the MicroVAX I--the first VAX microcomputer. Although it was a low-volume product compared with the New England-developed MicroVAX II, the MicroVAX I demonstrated the set of architectural decisions needed to support a single-board implementation of the VAX computer family, and it also provided a platform for embedded applications written in VAXELN.
The VAXELN team made the decision, for the first release, to use the Pascal language as its system programming language. Other languages, including C, were supported in later releases of the system. The small and very focused development team built the first product in approximately 18 months.
VAXELN allowed a developer to write a self-contained embedded system application that would run on VAX (and later MicroVAX) hardware with no other operating system present. The system was debuted in Las Vegas in the early 1980s, with a variety of amusing applications written by the development team, ranging from a system that composed and played minuets to a robotic system that played and solved the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
Trivia.
The system was originally supposed to be named ELAN, but DEC discovered at the last minute that it was trademarked in a European country where DEC wished to conduct business. The company holding the trademark to ELAN was the Slovenian sports equipment manufacturer Elan. In order to avoid litigation DEC quickly renamed it to VAXELN by dropping the A, much to the disgruntlement of the developers. Some documentation and marketing material had already been printed referring to the product as ELAN, and samples of these posters were prized for many years by members of the original team.

Michael Willcocks

Lieutenant General Sir Michael Alan Willcocks, KCB, CVO (born 27 July 1944) was until 30 April 2009 the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod for the Parliament of the United Kingdom's House of Lords. This title is generally shortened to Black Rod.
Military career.
Willcocks was commissioned into the Royal Regiment of Artillery in 1964. He was appointed Commanding Officer of 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery in 1983. He became Deputy Assistant Chief Of Staff at Headquarters UK Land Forces in 1985, Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence/Operations at Headquarters UK Land Forces in 1988 and Commander Royal Artillery for 4th Armoured Division in 1989. He went on to be Assistant Chief of Staff for Land Operations at the Joint War Headquarters for the Gulf War in 1991, Director of Army Plans and Programme at the Ministry of Defence in 1991 and Director-General Land Warfare at the Ministry of Defence in 1993.
He was then appointed Chief of Staff for the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps in 1994, Chief of Staff for the Land Component of the Peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995 and Assistant Chief of the General Staff in 1996. His last appointments were as Deputy Commander (Operations) for the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1999 and as UK military representative to NATO and the European Union from 2000 until his retirement in 2001.
Black Rod.
Willcocks was appointed Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod on 9 May 2001. After seven years in this post, he announced in late 2008 that he was stepping down from the role, and relinquished the post on 29 April 2009. At his last State Opening of Parliament, Dennis Skinner, MP, who was famous for interrupting Black Rod with a traditional "Queen's Speech Joke", asked, "any Tory moles at the Palace?". This was in reference to the recent arrest of Conservative MP Damian Green in connection with an investigation about him receiving confidential information from a civil servant at the Home Office who was formerly a Conservative Party candidate. In a mild but highly memorable breach of protocol, Willcocks responded (interruptions are supposed to be ignored) "I shall miss you, Dennis", receiving laughter from other MPs. 
As Black Rod, Willcocks oversaw the Queen Mother's lying-in-state at Westminster Hall. 
He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours, 2000. The Queen invested him with the insignia of a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on his retirement as Black Rod on 29 April 2009.
Willcocks is also a Knight Commander of Merit with Star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George.
Other roles.
Sir Michael is also the current Charter Commissioner for the Press Complaints Commission.

<doc id="2845294" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845294" title="Tripping (song)">
Tripping (song)

"Tripping" is a song by British pop singer Robbie Williams, it was the first single from his 2005 album "Intensive Care". The single was backed with the track "Make Me Pure", also from the same album, it was sent to radio stations around the world. Williams himself calls the song "something like a mini gangster opera" and "kind of cabaret act reggae". The rolling rhythm of the song owes much to the early work of The Clash. During the chorus Williams reaches an extremely high disco-like head voice. Lyrically the song is a bit darker than previous songs. It tells the tale of gangsters and how they "don't kill their own and they all love their mothers", before an anguished chorus of "I've taken as much as I'm willing to take". The opening lyrics "First they ignore you, then laugh at you and hate you. Then they fight you, then you win" is a paraphrase from a quote commonly attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. The song was the 26th best selling of 2005 in the UK.
Music video.
The video, which was directed by Johan Renck, features Williams running in place as if he can't seem to get anywhere. It appears that Williams is having a nightmare, in which he is living sometime in 1950s, and is stuck running endlessly without ever advancing, or driving in a stereotypical 1950s backdrop. It also includes a baby singing to him some of the chorus, and a pair of lesbian twins in his car's backseat. The car is a Saab 95. He also sees himself trapped in an elevator with a bigger guy in drag that proposed him to make out, he tries to defend himself but, at the end he allows him to be touched, and at that moment, Williams wakes up, smiles and close his eyes.
Chart success.
The song became a massive worldwide success for Williams, debuting inside the top ten in most countries around Europe, including number-two in the United Kingdom, spending six weeks inside the top ten and fifteen inside the top seventy-five. The single reached number-one in Argentina, Germany (where it was his first #1 single), Portugal, Italy, and Taiwan. In Switzerland, the single was certified Gold. In Mexico, the song reached number-nine and became the eleventh most played track of the year. In Australia, the single peaked at number-seven and went on to sell over 35,000 copies, being certified Gold by the ARIA.

Daphne Island

Daphne Major is a volcanic island just north of Santa Cruz Island and just west of the Baltra Airport in the Archipelago of Colón, commonly known as the Galápagos Islands. It consists of a tuff crater, devoid of trees, whose rim rises 120 metres above the sea.
Though easily accessible to most visitors to the Galápagos, the national park service has highly restricted visits to this island, and it is primarily used for scientific research. An intensive study of Darwin's finches was conducted here by biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant over a period of 20 years. They examined the behaviour and life cycles of finches, with the results strongly supporting Darwin's theory of evolution. Their efforts were documented in the Pulitzer Prize winning book "The Beak of the Finch".
Daphne is home to a variety of other birds including Galápagos Martins, Blue-footed Booby, Nazca Booby, Short-eared Owls, Red-billed Tropicbirds and Magnificent Frigatebirds.

The Red Arrows in diamond formation at Radom AirShow, 2005]]
A diamond formation is a formation of four or more aircraft, soldiers on horseback, players in a team sport, etc. whereby the position of the individuals when viewed as a whole resembles a diamond, or kite, shape.
Aircraft.
A diamond formation is done by starting with one aircraft, and then increasing by one, the number of aircraft in each successive row, and then decreasing again by one until there is only one aircraft in the last row, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. The flight position is such that there is no aircraft facing the tail of any aircraft in front.
At least four aircraft are required for this formation. The largest number of sixteen (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1) is known as a "tight formation". Rarely attempted on jet aircraft, this feat was first achieved by the Pakistan Air Force in 1964 on U.S.-made F-86 Sabres. It is considered a difficult formation as the aircraft have to fly very close to each other, and the closer the planes are together, the more authentic is the formation. Similarly, the larger the number of aircraft, the higher the risk involved (as compared to other formations).
Military.
Diamond formations have been used in warfare particularly by cavalry throughout known history.
Sport.
Football.

Potomac, Virginia

Potomac, Virginia, is an extinct incorporated town formerly located in Arlington County, Virginia (then called Alexandria County). A planned community, its proximity to Washington D.C. made it a popular place for employees of the U.S. government to live. Potomac was located adjacent to the massive Potomac Yard of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad.
History.
The area was developed beginning in 1894 as the communities of Del Ray, St. Elmo, Mt. Ida, and Hume, following a grid plan independent of that of Old Town Alexandria. Potomac was incorporated as a town in 1908. In 1928, the town had 2,355 residents.
The Town of Potomac was annexed by the independent city of Alexandria in 1930. Today, the Town of Potomac Historic District in Alexandria designates this historic portion of the city, and includes and 690 buildings. The Town of Potomac was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
As of 2010, the United States Postal Service still recognizes "Potomac, VA" as an acceptable alternate address for ZIP code 22301, although "Alexandria, VA" is preferred.

<doc id="2845318" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845318" title="Broulee, New South Wales">
Broulee, New South Wales

Broulee is a town on the south coast of New South Wales between Batemans Bay and Moruya. In 2006, the town had a population of 1,292 people. Just off the beach is Broulee Island, currently joined to the mainland, but in past years the connecting spit has been covered by water, at times a very deep navigable channel with a strong current. 
The first harbour in the area south of Batemans Bay was established at Broulee behind what is now known as the island. Although settlement had already commenced on the shores of the nearby Moruya River, it was not easily navigable due to a sandbar at its mouth.
History.
The Broulee area was surveyed and gazetted in 1837 and land sales commenced in 1840. At that time a post office was opened with mail being delivered each week over the mountains from Braidwood. Henry Clarke took up farming in the Broulee area in the 1840s after emigrating from Ireland. The first court in the district was established also in 1840 and in 1841 Broulee was made the centre of a police district which covered the area from Jervis Bay to Eden, New South Wales.
In 1841 a flood washed away the sandbar at the mouth of the Moruya River. Land up the river was for sale from 1848 and the Moruya town site surveyed in 1850 and the town gazetted in 1851. That year gold was discovered at Araluen inland from Moruya and near Braidwood. The road from Moruya to Araluen became the preferred route and the functions that had been at Broulee shifted to the growing town of Moruya.
In 1859 the court, including the building, was relocated to Moruya. The building of the Erin-go-Bragh Hotel was also shifted from Broulee Island to Campbell St, Moruya. The inn building was first used as a store and later became the storekeeper's home. The building was demolished in 1978 as part of the development of the new Eurobodalla Shire offices. Footings of the inn building can still be seen on the island.
Broulee harbour was lost in 1873 as removal of vegetation for an access road on the land spit eroded the spit and isolated what is now known as Broulee Island. In the last decades of the twentieth century, the spit or tombolo has reformed.
Landmarks and Townships.
There is a lighthouse on Burrewarra Point to the north of Broulee.
Businesses in the town include a general store / post office / liquor outlet / fuel. There is a newsagent, a take-away food outlet and a real estate agency.
The southern beach has a Surf Lifesaving Club with facilities including toilets, accessed from a road below the headland. There is also a boat launching ramp here, but weather conditions need to be right. There is no police station or medical facility, the closest being Moruya. The Rural Fire Service has a volunteer station. There are a number of schools in the area.
Tourist Attractions.
From 1972 the island has been managed as the Broulee Island Nature Reserve.
There is a modern caravan park with on-site vans and cabins available. Another camping area (basic) is located at the southern end of the South Beach, adjacent to Moruya Airport and Moruya River (boat ramp). There are other accommodation options including a motel, bed and breakfast establishments, and holiday cottages for rent.
Activities in the area include surfing, swimming, wind surfing, fishing (beach, rock, estury, ocean) walks, bicycling. Vehicle touring to nearby scenic beaches and headlands is popular. There are 4WD opportunities in nearby State Forests and National Parks. In recent years, the numbers of visiting whales especially the Southern Right Whale (may rest and stay in the area, sometimes entering into Moruya River) and Humpback Whale show increase in adjacent waters. Bottlenose Dolphins, Australian Sea Lions, and sea turtles can be observed from shores as well.
Mogo is a nearby village with artists, crafts and food, as well as historic Mogo Goldfields and the Mogo Zoo.
Broulee is a popular weekend destination for residents of Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory.

<doc id="2845319" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845319" title="Traditional Anglican Communion">
Traditional Anglican Communion

The Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC) is an international communion of churches in the continuing Anglican movement independent of the Anglican Communion and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The TAC upholds the theological doctrines of the Affirmation of St. Louis and an Anglo-Catholic interpretation of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Each of the respective jurisdictions utilizes a designated Book of Common Prayer deemed free of innovation. Most parishioners of these churches would be described as being traditional Anglo-Catholics in their theology and liturgical practice. Some parishes use the Anglican Missal in their liturgies. The TAC is guided by a college of bishops from across the communion and headed by an elected primate. 
The TAC was formed in 1991. Archbishop Louis Falk was its first primate. He was succeeded in 2002 by Archbishop John Hepworth of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia. At present Archbishop Samuel P. Prakash (India) is the Acting Primate.
The TAC churches have been formed outside of the Anglican Communion churches over a number of different issues. The principal issue has been the ordination of women. Other issues include liturgical revisions, the acceptance of homosexual activity and the importance of tradition within the Church.
The most common quoted membership, from the TAC itself, is 400,000.
Overtures to the Holy See.
In October 2007 the bishops of TAC formally expressed the desire to enter into full unity with the See of Rome without losing core Anglican distinctives and declared their adherence to the doctrines expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. In a statement authorised by Archbishop Hepworth on 16 October 2007: 
The College of Bishops of the Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC) met in Plenary Session in Portsmouth, England, in the first week of October 2007 and unanimously agreed to the text of a letter to the See of Rome seeking full, corporate, sacramental union. The Primate of the TAC agreed that no member of the College would give interviews until the Holy See has considered the letter and responded.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, on 5 July 2008, that it was giving serious consideration to the prospect of corporate union with groups of Anglicans, observing that "the situation within the Anglican Communion in general has become markedly more complex". The Traditional Anglican Communion does not hold membership in the Anglican Communion.
On 29 October 2009 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced Pope Benedict XVI's intention to create a new type of ecclesiastical structure, called a "personal ordinariate", for unspecified groups of Anglicans entering into full communion with the See of Rome.
The press release envisaged that married Anglican clergy who join the Roman Catholic Church might be ordained as Catholic priests but not as bishops; therefore, the Constitution stipulates that the ordinary can be either a priest or an unmarried bishop. For the Holy See, "Historical and ecumenical reasons preclude the ordination of married men as bishops in both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches." On 4 November 2009, Pope Benedict signed the apostolic constitution, "Anglicanorum Coetibus", which was released on 9 November 2009.
On 3 March 2010, in Orlando, Florida, the eight members of the House of Bishops of the Anglican Church in America — the United States branch of the TAC — voted unanimously to formally ask the Holy See to be accepted as a personal ordinariate. On 17 March 2010, leaders of the Canadian branch of the TAC (the Anglican Catholic Church of Canada) decided to do the same. The TAC member churches in the United Kingdom and Australia also petitioned for the formation of respective ordinariates. 
On 1 March 2012, the TAC College of Bishops announced the acceptance, with immediate effect, of Archbishop Hepworth's resignation as Primate and the appointment of Archbishop Samuel Prakash as Acting Primate. The college also made it known that the TAC would not be accepting the offer made to Anglicans by the Holy See.
Member churches.
At present the Traditional Anglican Communion consists of 15 member churches: 
Africa:
Americas:
Asia:
Europe:

George Beauchamp

George Delmetia Beauchamp (March 18, 1899 – March 30, 1941) was an American inventor of musical instruments and a co-founder of National Stringed Instrument Corporation and Rickenbacker guitars.
Born in Coleman County, Texas, Beauchamp performed in vaudeville, playing the violin and the lap steel guitar, before he settled in Los Angeles, California. During the 1920s, he experimented with the creation of electric lap steel guitars, electric guitars, electric bass guitars, electric violins, and instrument amplifiers. In 1931 he joined with Paul Barth and Adolph Rickenbacker to form the Ro-Pat-In Corporation to produce and sell electrified string instruments. In 1937 Beauchamp secured a United States patent for the electric guitar.
He died of a heart attack in 1941 while deep-sea fishing near Los Angeles. He was survived by his wife, Myrtle, and two children, Frances and Nolan.
Inventions.
Catalogues from the Electro String Instrument Corporation show a range of electric instruments. In 1932, Beauchamp's Ro-pat company marketed the electric lap steel guitar. The electric guitar was supposedly marketed the same year; early catalogues showing the instrument are not dated.

Robina Stadium

Robina Stadium, currently known as its sponsored name Cbus Super Stadium, is a rectangular football stadium in the Gold Coast suburb of Robina, Queensland. It is the home ground to the National Rugby League's Gold Coast Titans and the LFL Australia's Queensland Brigade. Starting in 2011, it will also become the home of the Gold Coast Sevens, the country's leg of the IRB Sevens World Series.
Construction of the venue started in 2006, and finished in February 2008, in time for the 2008 National Rugby League season, when it became the new home of the Titans.
The Stadium.
Robina Stadium is located in the satellite growth suburb of Robina, next to Robina railway station. The stadium is effectively a smaller version of Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, and was designed by the same company. The project was funded by the Queensland Government. On 27 September 2006, it was announced that the new ground would be renamed Skilled Park after SKILLED Group won the naming rights to the stadium. The land for the site was purchased by the Gold Coast City Council and gifted to the Queensland Government to build the Stadium.
Sports Minister Judy Spence announced that the new stadium will now be able to seat 27,400 people instead of 25,000. This came after workers on the site found extra space for about 2,400 seats across the stadium while construction was in progress.
Robina Stadium hosted 2 matches in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, which was held in Australia. The first saw eventual tournament champions New Zealand defeat Papua New Guinea 48-6. The second, a Semi-final Qualifier, saw a Jarryd Hayne led Fiji defeat Ireland 30-14. The ground also became host to the newly created A-League side, , starting in 2009-10.
The ground first saw finals football when the Titans, in their first finals appearance, hosted the Brisbane Broncos in the first week of the 2009 NRL season play-offs. This ground also witnessed finals when the Gold Coast Titans defeated the New Zealand Warriors 28-16 in the 2010 finals.
Beginning in November 2011, the stadium will host the Gold Coast Sevens, the first event in the annual IRB Sevens World Series of rugby sevens. The country's leg of the series had previously been staged in Adelaide in early autumn (March/April) at the Adelaide Oval, but was put up for bidding upon the expiry of Adelaide's hosting contract.
In Round 4 of the 2014 NRL season, a 3 foot brown snake invaded the stadium, now known as Cbus Super Stadium, during a match between the Titans and Queensland rivals the North Queensland Cowboys. No one was injured, with the snake remaining in the southeast corner until midway through the game.

Terenure College RFC

Terenure College RFC was founded on November 14, 1940. It is a senior rugby club in Dublin, Ireland.
History.
Terenure College RFC was founded on November 14, 1940. With a great love for the game and concerned that past pupils were not playing rugby union after leaving school, Rev. Fr Jackie Corbett, O.Carm., chaired a meeting of rugby playing past pupils of Terenure College in the Hotel Lenehan, Harcourt Street, Dublin. Those present included Johnny Corrigan, Hugh Clarke, Joe Clarke, Sean Ryan, P.P. Maguire, Colm O' Nolan, Niall Thunder, Hugh Milroy, Dick Dunlop, Des Giltrap, Jack Hearne and Dudley Fisher. Terenure Collegians Rugby Football Club was formed. Fr. Corbett was elected first President. J.P. Clarke was elected Hon. Secretary, Johnny Corrigan as Hon. Treasurer and Hugh Milroy as Club Captain. 
Terenure played their first match shortly afterwards against the Terenure College SCT at the time. The club won 8 points to 3. It took until January 8, 1959 for Terenure to be promoted to a Senior club after fourteen applications to the Leinster Branch, that after winning five Junior 1 titles and many other trophies. Two years later Mick Hipwell was selected to play for Ireland, Terenure's first Irish international. Mick played against England at Twickenham.
The years 1965-7 were successful seasons for Terenure under the captaincy of Eddie Coleman (later to be IRFU president), as they won the Leinster Senior league twice in a row. Terenure College RFC has had many players play for Ireland including Mick Hipwell, Brendan Sherry, Paul Haycock, Ciaran Clarke, Niall Hogan, David Corkery, Girvan Dempsey, and Eric Miller. Terenure has also supplied personnel to the Irish team at other levels including Paddy 'Rala' O'Reilly as Baggage Master to the Senior Team and British and Irish Lions (2009 tour to South Africa), Colin Phillips as Baggage Master to the Irish 'A', U21 and U19 Teams and the Japanese Senior Team, Liaison Officer to the Fijian Team on their Autumn Tour '09 and Samoan Team on their Autumn Tour '10, Argentina on their Autumn Tour 2012 Baggage Master/Assistant Manager Irish U20 2011/2012 for both Six Nations and Junior World Cup in Cape Town South Africa and Martin Searson as Baggage Master to U19's.
The Club now.
Leinster have benefited greatly from Terenure's 'rugby factory' with former players such as Girvan Dempsey, David Blaney, Niall Hogan, Mark Egan, David McAllister and Brian Blaney playing for the province. Currently Leinster's Isaac Boss is contracted through Terenure College.
Terenure field the most adult teams in the province of Leinster, with seven adult teams fielded each week. In addition, 450 boys and girls play mini-rugby every Sunday.
Terenure College has provided two Presidents of the IRFU - M. H. Carroll (1984–85) and E. Coleman (2000–01) and one president of the Leinster Branch - D. Lamont (2009–2010)
Coached by former Munster and Leinster hooker James Blaney and coaches John Coffey and Derm Blaney. Terenure play in the top division of the All Ireland League, having been promoted in 2014 from Division 1B on the back of promotion the previous season from Division 2A.

William &quot;Billy&quot; Jones

William "Billy" Jones (1884–1968), a seasoned veteran of the steam era who established the Wildcat Railroad in Los Gatos, California, was born the son of a teamster in the town of Ben Lomond, California, USA.
Jones found employment as an engine wiper at the age of 13 with the narrow gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad at Boulder Creek, California. At 17, Jones was promoted to fireman, and later became an engineer. The South Pacific Coast Railroad, which had been acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad, was converted to a standard gauge road by 1909. Jones was among the first to work the first standard gauge portions of the line out of San Jose, ultimately advancing to the Coast Daylight run between San Francisco and San Luis Obispo. After World War II, he was in charge of the reassembly of the preserved locomotive "Gov. Stanford" for Stanford University; the locomotive is currently on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento.
Jones married Geraldine McGrady, the schoolteacher at Wright's Station, located south of Los Gatos. After settling down in Los Gatos on a prune orchard known as "The Ranch", the Jones family grew to include two sons, Robert and Neal, and two daughters, Betty and Geraldine. The Ranch was located at the corner of Daves Avenue and the Santa Clara-Los Gatos Road (today's Winchester Boulevard).
Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad.
On the docks of San Francisco in 1939, Jones discovered an gauge steam locomotive built in 1905 and designed to run on the Venice Railway in Venice Beach, California. He bought the little engine, nicknamed the 2-spot, for $100 and got it running again on a miniature railway he and his railroad buddies constructed on the ranch, dubbed the "Wildcat Railroad".
Sons Robert and Neal were victims of World War II, and Jones operated his "Wildcat Railroad" for the neighborhood children, every Sunday until his death in 1968, in memory of his two lost sons. The railroad attracted people from across the valley and beyond, including Walt Disney, who considered purchasing some of Jones' collection of miniature railway equipment. The two became friends, and Jones was behind the throttle of Disney's narrow gauge locomotives on opening weekend at Disneyland on July 17, 1955.
Jones retired from the Southern Pacific Company in 1949. In January 1959, it is said Jones ceremoniously ran the last train out of Los Gatos before the rails were taken up throughout the town.
Jones died of leukemia in 1968 at the age of 83, and his "Wildcat Railroad" was purchased by local residents who formed a non-profit organization to relocate and operate it at Oak Meadow Park and Vasona Park in Los Gatos. The railroad opened for regular operations in July 1970 after nearly two years of restoration and construction. By 1992, the railroad was averaging well over 100,000 riders each year.
It was also in 1992 that the railroad acquired its first diesel locomotive. Previously, the railroad had solely operated the steam locomotive that Billy had discovered in San Francisco in 1939. Realizing the need for a larger locomotive fleet, the railroad pursued options to acquire a more reliable diesel locomotive. Local businessman and railroad enthusiast Albert B. Smith purchased a brand new diesel hydraulic locomotive from Chicago Locomotive Works and donated the locomotive to the railroad. Smith died a year later.
In 1994, the 2-spot was in need of a new boiler and complete overhaul. In the meantime, the new diesel, dubbed #2502, would serve as the primary locomotive of the railroad. After a ten year restoration project, the 2-spot finally returned to service in July 2005. The occasion marked the 100th birthday of the steam locomotive and also celebrated the 35th anniversary of the Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad in Vasona Park
The railroad purchased another diesel locomotive in 2006 and dubbed it #3502. Both diesels continue to operate weekdays during summer and weekends during winter and early spring. A third diesel, #4, built in 2005 by volunteer Tom Waterfall in the style of a Davenport Locomotive Works locomotive, is used in work train service. The restored 2-spot operates weekends from late spring until the end of fall.
In May 2013, the railroad took delivery of a second steam locomotive, #5. The locomotive is a 4-6-2 oil burner built by the Merrick Light Railway Works, which also built 3502. The 5-spot will be put in rotation with the 2-spot to avoid having to use 2502 or 3502 when either steam locomotive breaks down. Several local media outlets printed information that the 2-spot would be retired, and the 5-spot would replace her. However, railroad management has stated on Facebook that the 2-spot would "always be a staple of the railroad".
The Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad also operates a historic Savage carousel named after one of the organization's founders, William "Bill" Mason. The carousel is located next to the railroad's depot in Oak Meadow Park and has its own unique history, having taken part in the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

<doc id="2845369" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2845369" title="Sodium molybdate">
Sodium molybdate

Sodium molybdate, Na2MoO4, is useful as a source of molybdenum. It is often found as the dihydrate, Na2MoO4·2H2O.
The molybdate(VI) anion is tetrahedral. Two sodium cations coordinate with every one anion.
History.
Sodium molybdate was first synthesized by the method of hydration. A more convenient synthesis is done by dissolving MoO3 in sodium hydroxide at 50–70 °C and crystallizing the filtered product. The anhydrous salt is prepared by heating to 100 °C.
Uses.
The agriculture industry uses 1 million pounds per year as a fertilizer. In particular, its use has been suggested for treatment of whiptail in broccoli and cauliflower in molybdenum-deficient soils. However, care must be taken because at a level of 0.3 ppm sodium molybdate can cause copper deficiencies in animals, particularly cattle.
It is used in industry for corrosion inhibition, as it is a non-oxidizing anodic inhibitor. The addition of sodium molybdate significantly reduces the nitrite requirement of fluids inhibited with nitrite-amine, and improves the corrosion protection of carboxylate salt fluids.
In industrial water treatment applications where galvanic corrosion is a potential due to bimetallic construction, the application of sodium molybdate is preferred over sodium nitrite. Sodium molybdate has the advantage in that the dosing of lower ppm's of molybdate allow for lower conductivity of the circulating water. Sodium molybdate at levels of 50-100 ppm offer the same levels of corrosion inhibition that sodium nitrite at levels of 800+ ppm. By utilizing lower concentrations of sodium molybdate, conductivity is kept at a minimum and thus galvanic corrosion potentials are decreased.
Reactions.
When reacted with sodium borohydride, molybdenum is reduced to a lower valent oxide:
Sodium molybdate reacts with the acids of dithiophosphates:
which further reacts to form [MoO3(S2P(OR)2)4].
Safety.
Sodium molybdate is incompatible with alkali metals, most common metals and oxidizing agents. It will explode on contact with molten magnesium. It will violently react with interhalogens (e.g., bromine pentafluoride; chlorine trifluoride). Its reaction with hot sodium, potassium or lithium is incandescent.

Paulette Caveat

The Paulette Caveat is a legal caveat concerning the validity of two treaties between the British Crown (then the ruling authority of Canada) and the Dene people, one of the First Nations of Canada.
In 1973, a group of Dene chiefs filed a caveat at the land titles office in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to gain a legal interest in of land in northern Canada. The chiefs wanted to claim the land by virtue of their aboriginal rights, and prevent further development until ownership had been settled. It came to be known as the Paulette Caveat, named after François Paulette, who was chief of the Fort Smith Chipewyan at the time, and one of the chiefs who initiated the caveat.
The land office referred the caveat to the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. Justice William Morrow, the only sitting judge of that court at the time, held a six-week hearing process to establish whether signatories of Treaty 8 and Treaty 11 had fully understood the meaning of the treaties they had signed in 1899 and 1921-2 respectively. Hearings were held in a number of communities in the Northwest Territories (some only accessible by plane), with some hearings being held in informal settings for the convenience of witnesses, many of whom were elderly.
Many witnesses testified that the signatories did not fully understand that the treaties abrogated their traditional rights to the land. Justice Morrow agreed with these witnesses and ruled that the chiefs had established a case for claiming aboriginal rights sufficiently to warrant the filing of a caveat.
The finding was appealed by the federal government and later overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada on a point of law., although the Court's decision did not question Morrow's finding of aboriginal rights.
The Supreme Court's ruling was the precursor to further negotiations between the Dene and the federal government to establish and clarify land rights, and talks were still in progress in 2005.

Sodium tungstate

Sodium tungstate is the inorganic compound with the formula Na2WO4•2H2O. This white, water-soluble solid is the sodium salt of orthotungstate. It is useful as a source of tungsten for chemical synthesis. It is an intermediate in the conversion of tungsten ores to the metal.
Preparation and structure.
The predominant route to this salt is the extraction of tungsten ores, almost all of which are tungstates. Thus, the ores, are treated with base to give sodium tungstate, as illustrated in the case of wolframite: 
Scheelite is treated similarly using sodium carbonate.
Sodium tungstate can also be produced by treating tungsten carbide with a mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium hydroxide in a fusion process which overcomes the high exothermicity of the reaction involved.
Several polymorphs of sodium tungstate are known, three at only one atmosphere pressure. They feature tetrahedral orthotungstate dianions but differ in the packing motif. The WO42- anion adopts a structure like sulfate (SO42-).
Reactions.
Treatment of sodium tungstate with hydrochloric acid gives the trioxide:
This reaction can be reversed using aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide
Uses.
In organic chemistry, sodium tungstate is used as catalyst for epoxidation of alkenes and oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes or ketones.
It is also known for its anti-diabetic effects; Researchers have identified the pathways through which sodium tungstate improves pancreatic function and beta cell proliferation.

My Date with the President's Daughter

"My Date with the President's Daughter" is a 1998 television film produced by Buena Vista Home Entertainment and Walt Disney. The film premiered as part of ABC's revival of The Wonderful World of Disney. It was shot in various locations around Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Plot.
Duncan Fletcher (Will Friedle) is an average teenager in search of a date to his school's spring dance. At the mall with his friends, he meets a girl named Hallie (Elisabeth Harnois) who just happens to be the daughter of the President of the United States, George Richmond (Dabney Coleman). Duncan, not realizing this, asks her to his school's dance. She accepts and gives him her address (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) and he replies by telling her he will pick her up at 7:00.
That night, Duncan's father (Jay Thomas) declines his request to borrow the company car, a red BMW M5 (E34). Duncan takes the company car anyway and goes to Hallie's to pick her up, only to end up at the White House. He does not realize she is the president's daughter, and at first believes Hallie was playing a joke on him.
When he enters, Hallie has Duncan meet her father, and Duncan is informed that there are limitations on where they can and cannot go, and that the Secret Service will be with them the entire time. Hallie says that they were just going to dinner and a movie, but at the movie theater, they sneak away from the Secret Service. Hallie and Duncan go to a movie and they get away with pretending to make out. They go to a store called f/x and get new clothes. Duncan uses his father's credit card and spends $730.16. After they go shopping, Duncan lets Hallie drive.
They encounter many obstacles throughout the night: Duncan's father's car getting stolen, confrontations at a dance club and a tavern, the Vice President's sleazy son, Reid Bosshardt (Adam Reid), having a fight with each other, and then defending themselves from Steve Ellinger (Grant Nickalls), a local bully. Hallie's and Duncan's fathers are out looking for them throughout the city but end up being arrested for a traffic violation by a traffic cop who fails to recognize the President. Duncan and Hallie both manage to come home safe but unhappy as they realize after their first kiss how much they like each other.
At the end of the film, even though they never make it to the dance, Duncan is satisfied about the outcome of the date. His dad gets mad about the whole thing and grounds him. But after he calms down, he decides to do more father-son things with him until he learns about what Duncan did with his credit card and accidentally crashes his car as a result. President Richmond comes to Duncan's school to thank him for taking care of his daughter and allow Duncan to continue seeing Hallie as well as establishing a friendship with Duncan's family. Duncan's reputation in school is improved as the result of being the President's daughter's boyfriend. Duncan's father gets a promotion after his employer is overjoyed of being able to meet and play golf with the President which saves his job and apparently causes him to remove Duncan's grounding sentence. Hallie and Duncan are able to pursue a real relationship and happily go on a second date. The camera zooms to reveal multiple Secret Service SUVs and a helicopter following them.
Soundtrack.
The film featured the aptly titled song "My Date with the President's Daughter" by the band The Presidents of the United States of America, describing events similar to those in the plot. The film also features the jazz song "Moonlight Magic" performed by Alan Moorhouse.
Reception.
"My Date with the President's Daughter" received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning a Rotten Tomatoes Want-To-See score of 35%, but no approval rating at this time. Many audience members consider that while it's not very original, it's "better than most "President's children" films". The movie was labeled as ""Amazing"" by "Fox Weekly, giving the film an 8 out of 10 score.
