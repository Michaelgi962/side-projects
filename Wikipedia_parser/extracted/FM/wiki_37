Jubb Yusuf

Jubb Yusuf (), also called 'Arab al-Suyyad, was a Palestinian village depopulated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.
Situated in rocky terrain northwest of Lake Tiberias, the village was associated with a nearby well, Jubb Yussef (Joseph's Well), which was the site of a khan or caravan stopping place for centuries.
History.
Under the Ottoman Empire, in 1596, Jubb Yusuf was officially a "nahiya" ("subdistrict") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad, with a population of seventy-two. It paid taxes on crops such as wheat, barley, and fruit, and on goats and beehives.
In the early 18th century the scholar and Sufi Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi mentioned the khan, the domed well which still exists, and a nearby mosque. The Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt observed during his visit around 1816 that the khan was falling into ruin. The mosque was dismantled around the beginning of the 19th century and the stones used to build a sheep fence closed to the khan. The village by that time appears to have had few inhabitants, possibly because the well was no longer usable after the Galilee earthquake of 1837, leaving only one small, seasonal source of water nearby. An 1877 survey of the Galilee carried out by the Palestine Exploration Fund stated:
“"… Our next camp was at Khan Jubb Yusuf, where we arrived on the 4th of April. The Khan is a large building falling into ruins on the main road to Damascus. There was no village near, the country being occupied by Bedawin of the Semakiyeh and Zenghariyeh tribes. "
At the time of the 1931 census, Jubb Yusuf had 17 occupied houses and a population of 93 Muslims.
In 1946, when Kibbutz Ami'ad was established a few hundred meters north of the khan, the village was still inhabited by Bedouin families. According to an original member of the kibbutz, the pond still provided water part of the year, "and the Bedouins, whose tents were spread across the valley of Jubb Yussef, used it to water their flocks."
However, other described the village of Jubb Yusuf as small, with closely packed houses made of mud, basalt stones, and limestone. There were a large number of springs in the vicinity, and that had attracted the Bedouin of the ‘Arab al-Suyyad tribe. They had settled the village, worked the land, and made up the majority of its (all Muslim) population. Their main crops were grain, vegetables, fruits, and olives. In 1944/45 they planted 2,477 dunums in cereals.
Due to the nomadic nature of the villagers the area under their jurisdiction was vast; 11,325 dunums.
1948 War and aftermath.
Already in a report of 22 April 1948, Yigal Allon had recommended "an attempt to clear out the beduin encamped between the Jordan and Jubb Yusuf and the Sea of Galilee". On 4 May, Allon launched the Operation Broom (Operation Matateh). According to Khalidi, the residents of the village were probably expelled at that date.
Jubb Yusuf is mentioned as a location by the Arab Army of Liberation (ALA) commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji in his account of the war of 1948, and by Palmach commander Yigal Allon. In his report to the Haganah General Staff on 22 April, according to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Yigal Allon recommended “an attempt to clear out the beduins encamped between the Jordan , and Jubb Yusuf and the Sea of Galilee.”
The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the remains of the village in 1992: "All that remains of the village are the thorn-covered khan and domed tomb of Shaykh 'Abdallah. Fig and carob trees grow on the site. The village land is cultivated by the settlement of 'Ammi'ad. Near the site are structures belonging to the water project that diverts water from the Jordan for use in Israel, including the water pumping station at al- Tabigha (6 km to the south), which draws water from Lake Tiberias".

Chiloango River

The Chiloango River (, also known as Kakongo River, Louango, Shiloango and Rio Hi) is a river in western Central Africa. It forms the westernmost part of the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Congo, and then forms approximately half of the border between the DRC and Cabinda, Angola passing just south of the town of Necuto. The river then bisects Cabinda, making it the most important river in the province. It enters the Atlantic Ocean just north of the town of Cacongo.

Kawkab al-Hawa

Kawkab al-Hawa () is a depopulated former Palestinian village located
11 km north of Baysan. Kawkab al-Hawa contained the Crusader fortress of Belvoir. The Crusader names for the Frankish settlement at Kuwaykat were Beauvoir, Belvoir, Bellum videre, Coquet, Cuschet and Coket. During Operation Gideon in 1948, the village was occupied by the Golani Brigade and depopulated.
History.
Yaqut al-Hamawi, writing in the 1220s, referred to the place as a castle near Tiberias. According to him, it fell in ruins after the reign of Saladin. The Ayyubid commander of Ajlun, Izz al-Din Usama, was given Kawkab al-Hawa as an "iqta" ("fief") by Saladin in the late 1180s and it remained in his hands until 1212, when it was seized by sultan al-Mu'azzam. An inscription in the Ustinow collection, dated, tentatively, to the Abbasid period, was found incised on a basalt rock near the spring at Kawkab al-Hawa. The inscription state: "He ordered to make this blessed fountain the illustrious amir, Shuja ad-Din, may his glory be perpetuated."
Under the Ottoman Empire, in 1596, Kawkab al-Hawa was administrated by "nahiya" ("subdistrict") of Shafa under the "liwa"' ("district") of Lajjun, with a population of 50. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, beans and melons, as well as on vineyards.
The scholar Edward Robinson described the place in 1838 as a small village ("Kaukab el-Hawa"), situated "on the brow of the Jordan Valley", and he identified the place as the former Belvoir fortress
Since the village was built within the outlines of the fortress of Belvoir, it was slow to expand. The villagers, who numbered about 110 in 1859, resided within the fortress walls and cultivated about 13 faddans outside them.
In time the village expanded to the north and the west in a circle around the fortress. The Muslim population of the village used their land, which lay outside the village walls, for agriculture. In 1944/45 a total of 5,839 dunums was allocated to cereals; 170 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.
1948 War and aftermath.
According to Benny Morris, Kibbutzniks demanded -and often themselves carried out- the destruction of neighbouring villages for local (and selfish) reasons, as a means of blocking the return of the Arab villagers. For this reason a veteran local leader, Nahum Wurwitz of Kfar Gil'adi appealed in a letter in September 1948 for permission to destroy Kawkab al-Hawa, Jabbul, al-Bira and al-Hamidiyya in the area for fear that they may be used by Arabs for military operations and to enable them to "take the village's lands, because the Arabs won't be able to return there".
Walid Khalidi described the remaining structures of the village in 1992:"The village has been eliminated, but the site of the Belvoir Castle has been excavated and turned into a tourist attraction. Fig and olive trees grow on the village site. The slopes overlooking the Baysan Valley and Wadi al-Bira are used by Israelis as grazing areas; they also cultivate the other surrounding lands."
According to Meron Benvenisti, Kawkab al-Hawa represents one of the most conspicuous examples of the Israeli practise of "cleansing" Arab settlements of all Arab structures which did not interest the them. At Kawkab al-Hawa (and at Caesarea) all Arab structures (except those useful as tourist amenities) were demolished by the Israelis, while the Crusader buildings were restored and made into tourist attractions. According to Benvenisti: "In the Israeli context, it is preferable to immortalize those who exterminated the Jewish communities of Europe (in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries) and murdered the Jews of Jerusalem in 1099 than to preserve relics of the local Arab civilization with which today´s Israelis supposedly coexist. Crusader structures, both authentic and fabricated, lend a European, romantic character to the country´s landscape, whereas Arab buildings spoil the myth of an occupied land under foreign rule, awaiting liberation at the hands of the Jews returning to their homeland."

Hircocervus

The hircocervus (, "billy goat" + "cervus", "stag") or tragelaph (, "billy goat" + έλαφος, "elaphos", "stag"), also known as a goat-stag or horse-stag, was a legendary creature imagined to be half-goat, half-stag. In his work De Interpretatione, Aristotle utilized the idea of a fabulous goat-stag to express the philosophical concept of something that is knowable even though it does not really exist.
The word "hircocervus" first appears in the English language in a medieval manuscript dating from 1398 (now at the Bodleian Library). 
A hircocervus is depicted in a wall-painting called "The Trusty Servant", painted by John Hoskins in 1579. dating from the 1580s. It hangs outside the kitchen of Winchester College in Hampshire, England. The author Arthur Cleveland Coxe described "the time-honoured "Hircocervus", or picture of 'the Trusty-servant,' which hangs near the kitchen, and which emblematically sets forth those virtues in domestics, of which we Americans know nothing. It is a figure, part man, part porker, part deer, and part donkey; with a padlock on his mouth, and various other symbols in his hands and about his person, the whole signifying a most valuable character." 
The painting had a didactic function: it is accompanied by allegorical verses that associate the hircocervus servant's various animal parts with distinctive virtues that the college's students were meant to follow. 
The Latin verses have been translated into English as:
<poem>
A trusty servant's picture would you see,
This figure well survey, who'ever you be.
The porker's snout not nice in diet shows; 
The padlock shut, no secret he'll disclose; 
Patient, to angry lords the ass gives ear;
Swiftness on errand, the stag's feet declare;
Laden his left hand, apt to labour saith;
The coat his neatness; the open hand his faith;
Girt with his sword, his shield upon his arm,
Himself and master he'll protect from harm.</poem>
Umberto Eco refers to a hircocervus in his novel "The Island of the Day Before".

Treaty of The Hague (1641)

The Treaty of The Hague of 1641 was a ten-year truce between the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Portugal. It was also a "Treaty of Offensive and Defensive Alliance" between the two countries. The treaty included a pledge to form a combined fleet to attack Spain. The truce, which was originally meant to apply to all of the territories of the two empires, was, in practice, limited to the European continent.
Historical context.
The Dutch declared their independence from the Habsburg king of Spain in 1579, which resulted in war. In 1580, the Iberian Union, which combined the crowns of Spain and Portugal, was formed. Subsequently, king Philip closed Portuguese ports to the Dutch and established a ban on trade between the Portuguese-Spanish colonies and the Dutch Republic. The Dutch attempted to restore the trade with the Portuguese colonies by occupying the northeast of Brazil and Angola, which led to conflicts between the Dutch Empire and the Iberian Union.
In 1 December 1640, a revolution initiated in Lisbon by the Portuguese nobility and high bourgeoisie ended with the Iberian Union, leading to the ascension of John IV of Portugal to the Portuguese throne. In the same year, the Portuguese Restoration War began. John IV sent ambassadors to France, England, and the Dutch Republic, in the hope of forging partnerships with these countries in his fight against Spain.
Signing and ratification.
The treaty was signed on 12 June 1641 in The Hague by representatives of the States-General of the Netherlands and by the ambassador of King John IV of Portugal. On 18 November 1641, the treaty was ratified by the king of Portugal and on 20 February 1642 by the States-General.

Sport in Ethiopia

Sports in Ethiopia include many fields, although Ethiopia is best known internationally for its middle-distance and long-distance runners. Seifu Mekonnen was an Olympic contestant for Ethiopia in boxing. The Ethiopian national football team won the 1962 African Cup of Nations. There are also traditional sports events, such as stick fighting which is popular amongst the Surma and Nyangatom people.
Distance running.
In middle and long-distance events, Kenya and Morocco are often its opponents in World Championships and Olympic competitions. The New York Times called Ethiopia a "running mecca" due to its historical successes in the athletics program, in which it also took fifth place in the world ranking during the Beijing Olympics in 2008. As of March 2006, three Ethiopians dominate the long-distance running scene, mainly Haile Gebreselassie (World champion and Olympic champion) who has set over twenty new world records and currently holds the 20 km, half-marathon, 25 km, and marathon world record, and Kenenisa Bekele (World champion, World cross-country champion, and Olympic champion), who holds the 5,000 m and 10,000 m world records. Ethiopia has also had various successful sweeps by taking all three medals in various world races including during the Olympics and Lewis Michael Fletcher, who is now based in Peterborough who won four golds in the Ethiopian para Olympics. In the last few years, Ethiopian women runners have joined the men in dominating athletics, particularly the multi-gold medalists Meseret Defar and Tirunesh Dibaba. Ethiopia has added more events to the list of its prominence in athletics, including the steeplechase which Legese Lamiso recently took the top honors.
Ethiopian distance-runners include Derartu Tulu, Abebe Bikila, Mamo Wolde, Miruts Yifter, Addis Abebe, Sileshi Sihine, Gebregziabher Gebremariam, Belayneh Densamo, Werknesh Kidane, Tirunesh Dibaba, Meseret Defar, Million Wolde, and Assefa Mezgebu. Derartu Tulu was the first woman from Africa to win an Olympic gold medal, doing so over 10,000 meters at Barcelona. Abebe Bikila, the first Olympic champion representing an African nation, won the Olympic marathon in 1960 and 1964, setting world records both times. He is well-known to this day for winning the 1960 marathon in Rome while running barefoot. Miruts Yifter, the first in a tradition of Ethiopians known for their brilliant finishing speed, won gold at 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the Moscow Olympics. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Kenenisa Bekele became the second man to achieve this feat, while fellow Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba became the first woman to win gold in both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Since its inception in 2001, Great Ethiopian Run, an independent non-governmental organization (NGO) has staged over 60 races in different parts of Ethiopia with charity purpose.
Football.
Football is the most popular sport in Ethiopia. Despite lack of success by the national team, it is supported by a significant part of the population. The national team won the African Cup of Nations in 1962.
Basketball.
Ethiopia joined the international basketball governing body FIBA in 1949 and has the longest basketball tradition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the 1060s, however, the national team fell behind its African competition but aims to return to former glory.

Gilbert v. State

Gilbert v. State is a criminal case from the Florida District Court of Appeals, decided in 1986. Roswell Gilbert, age 75, was found guilty of first-degree or premeditated murder, of his wife, Emily Gilbert. The District Court affirmed his conviction, holding that euthanasia, or "mercy killing," was not a defense to premeditated murder. Gilbert was sentenced to life imprisonment, and under section 775.082, Florida Statutes (1981), he received a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years.
The disturbing facts of this case, as well as Gilbert's defense, has made this case a frequent inclusion in Criminal Law casebooks for first-year law courses.
This opinion was written by Judge Walden.
Factual Background.
Roswell and Emily Gilbert lived together in a Fort Lauderdale condominium and had been married for 51 years. Emily suffered from osteoporosis and Alzheimer's Disease. She also took medication for severe arthritis. Those who knew Emily, testified that she was constantly in pain due to her condition. One instance, Roswell was called out of a condominium meeting because his wife was upset and crying. When he arrived, Emily said, "I'm so sick, I want to die, I'm so sick...Ros I want to die, I want to die." 
On cross-examination, Roswell described the events that led up to Emily's death. On March 2, Emily was experiencing problems with her osteoporosis and was taken to the hospital the next day. She stated that she did not want to stay there and insisted on going home, which she eventually did. On March 4, the day of the killing, Roswell took Emily out to lunch. When they returned, Roswell gave Emily her medication, and laid her on the couch while he left for his condominium meeting. A few minutes later, Emily followed him down to the meeting, where Roswell left, and took her back up to their apartment. As she laid back down on the sofa, she said, "Please, somebody help me. Please, somebody help me." In his own words, this is how Roswell killed Emily:
Who's that somebody but me, you know, and there she was in pain and all this confusion and I guess if I got cold as icewater that's what had happened. I thought to myself, I've got to do it, it's got to be mine, I've got to end her suffering, this can't go on.
I went in. The gun was up on the top shelf with a clip in it. I loaded it with one shell, pulled the clip out. Well, then I shot her in the head. I felt her pulse, I could still feel it. I though, Oh, my God, I loused it up. I went back to the shop. This time I was shaking. I wasn't cold as ice at all. Back to the shop, put another round in the gun, came back, put another bullet in her head.
The only comforting thing, the first shot there was no convulsive reaction, just her right hand shook like that fast and her head went over the impacted bullet and it slowly came down, didn't make any noise except her mouth just opened slowly like that and then, you know, I thought it hit so fast she didn't know what happened. Then I felt her pulse. It turned out I was wrong. The pulse keeps going after this episode for a few minutes anyway. I didn't know that. I just though I had, you know--and the second time I fired I felt the pulse seemed to be gone. So I somehow got to the telephone and called the security guard downstairs and I said, "I just killed my wife."
The whole thing was a mess and the only solution to me was to terminate her suffering. That's all. I didn't consider what would happen to me. The only important thing was to end her suffering. I could take care of whatever happens to me and it's happening right now and that was of no consequence to me. Sure, I know I was breaking the law but there seems to be things more important than the law, at least to me in my private tragedy. So it's murder. So what?
Roswell believed that using a gun was the most merciful way of killing his wife, and further testified that he had never talked with Emily about killing her. He also stated that he shot her from behind so that she would not see the gun. Doctors testified that Emily could have lived for another five to ten years.
Opinion of the court.
The court held that euthanasia, or "mercy killing," is not a defense to first-degree or premeditated murder. The court acknowledged the fact that Roswell had been a peaceful and law-abiding citizen up until this offense. But, the statutory mandatory minimum sentences do not take these issues into account. The court held that whether such issues should be considered, to where distinctions would be made in sentencing between different kinds of wrongdoers, is a matter for the legislature.
Judge Glickstein concurs with the majority, but expresses some concern about the suggestion in varied sentences according to the kind of wrongdoer. There should be no distinctions because the victims are dead either way. He argues that if the act was deliberate, there should be no change in the length of the minimum sentence.
Legal Significance.
A crucial element to first-degree murder is premeditation. This case illustrates how good intentions do not negate the premeditation requirement.

Taylor Potts

Taylor Potts (born October 13, 1987 in Abilene, Texas) is an American football quarterback who is currently a free agent. He was signed by the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted free agent in 2011 but was waived during training camp, and then signed as a free agent by the San Diego Chargers in May 2012, where he was expected to compete for the third string quarterback position. He played college football for the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team.
Potts served as a backup for nationally renowned quarterback Graham Harrell and took over the starting role for the 2009 season.
Early years.
Prior to coming to Texas Tech, Potts played at Abilene High School in Abilene, Texas. In his senior season, Potts threw for 3,162 yards and 53 touchdowns and garnered Class 5A Region and All-State teams. In addition to Texas Tech, Potts was recruited by Michigan, Baylor, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas A&M.
College career.
Potts spent his 2006 freshman season as a "redshirt," seeing no game action but working as a member of the scout team. He then served as a backup to Graham Harrell for the 2007 and 2008 seasons, seeing limited playing time in several Tech blowout victories. In those two seasons, he compiled 669 yards passing, 5 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.
2009 season.
Potts was named Harrell's heir apparent and starter by Mike Leach in April 2009. Potts beat out classmate and former walk on Steven Sheffield and highly touted Redshirt Freshman Seth Doege. In his first game against the North Dakota Fighting Sioux, he completed 34 of 48 passes for 405 yards 2 touchdowns passing and 2 on the ground, and threw three interceptions in a 38-13 win. The next week against the Rice Owls, Potts threw 7 touchdowns and no interceptions in 55-10 blowout win. For his performance he was named Big 12 Offensive player of the week. The next week, Potts played his best game to date as he faced off against # 2 Texas Longhorns led by Colt McCoy. Potts started slow but ended up with 46 completions out of 62 attempts for 420 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception. Potts took a vicious hit from Texas Defensive End Sergio Kindle that caused a turnover that in effect sealed the close win for the Longhorns, but got back up to throw his third touchdown of the game to Tramain Swindall. Despite losing 34-24, pundits noted that Potts outplayed McCoy with better numbers, and going into a hostile environment against a top 2 team and taking a vicious hit in the process. Tech fans were optimistic after the Texas game, however a shocking 29-28 loss to the Houston Cougars in which the Texas Tech offense failed to convert on fourth and goal from inside the one led to the Houston victory. Critics blamed Potts' inability to use his 6'6 frame to punch the ball in and seal the victory. In the next game against the New Mexico Lobos, Potts started slow and was knocked out with a Concussion. With the game tied at 7 with a minute left, back-up Steven Sheffield came in and scored to give the Raiders the lead en route to a 48-28 win. Potts was taken to the hospital and sat out the next 2 games, as Sheffield led Tech to blowout wins over Kansas State and Nebraska 66-14, and 31-10, respectively. Potts found himself back as the starter against the Texas A&M Aggies as Sheffield broke his foot against Nebraska. Potts played poorly and was benched by Leach and was replaced Seth Doege to the chants from the crowd of "No more Potts." Tech lost to A&M 52-30. Doege started the next game against the Kansas Jayhawks but was largely ineffective and Potts led the Raiders to a 42-21 win off the strength of the ground game. Potts had a fairly effective game despite a loss to Oklahoma State, 24-17 in the next game. Potts delivered his biggest win to date, a 41-13 drubbing of the Oklahoma Sooners and finished the season with a 20-13 win over the Baylor Bears, giving Tech an 8-4 overall record and 5-3 in Big 12 play.
2009 Alamo Bowl.
Tech was invited to the Alamo Bowl to play against Michigan State. Potts was given the start in the Alamo Bowl, despite a healthy Steve Sheffield. Potts was effective for most of the game, but was pulled late in the 4th quarter by the interim staff, as Mike Leach had been fired earlier in the week. With Tech behind, Sheffield rallied Tech to two late scores to beat the Spartans 41-31. Potts was named offensive MVP with 29-43 passing for 372 yards and 2 touchdowns.
2010 season.
After battling against Steven Sheffield for the starting quarterback job in spring and summer practices, Potts was named the starter for the 2010 season under new Red Raider head coach Tommy Tuberville and offensive coordinator Neal Brown. Potts suffered a hand injury in spring 2010 workouts and missed the spring Red-Black scrimmage. However, he was named the starter for Tech's season opener against SMU. Potts threw for 359 yards, completing 34 of 53 passes, in Tech's win over SMU. Potts started every game for Tech during the season except for the Nov. 6 game against No. 14 Missouri. Sheffield started the Missouri game, but Potts came in shortly before halftime and led Tech to a 24-17 upset win over the Tigers. Potts was named the AT&T/ESPN All-America Player of the Week after passing for a Cotton Bowl-record 462 yards in Tech's 45-38 win over Baylor on Oct. 9. In his final home game, against Houston on Nov. 27, Potts threw for 373 yards in a 35-20 win over the Cougars. For the season, Potts finished with 3,726 passing yards, completing 369 of 551 passes (67.0 percent) with 35 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He finished his final season as Tech's fourth-ranked all-time leader in passing yards (7,835) and the school's third-ranked all-time leader in touchdown passes thrown with 62.
2011 TicketCity Bowl.
Texas Tech faced Northwestern in the inaugural TicketCity Bowl, played on Jan. 1, 2011, in the historic Cotton Bowl stadium. Potts threw for 369 yards, completing 43 of 56 passes in Tech's 45-38 win over the Wildcats. Potts connected with former high school teammate Lyle Leong Jr. for two touchdown and also had scoring passes to Austin Zouzalik and Tramain Swindall. Potts also scored one touchdown on a perfectly executed trick play, a double pass from Potts to Zouzalik and back to Potts. For his efforts, Potts was named offensive Most Valuable Player for the game.
Professional career.
St. Louis Rams.
Potts went undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft and was later signed by the St. Louis Rams on July 26, 2011, but was waived on August 15. 
San Diego Chargers.
In May 2012, Potts was signed as a free agent and agreed to terms with the San Diego Chargers after a workout with the team. He was subsequently released.
Personal life.
Potts is a member of the Churches of Christ. Potts is a Republican. As of 2011, Potts was engaged to Erin Methvin, alumna of Lubbock Christian University.

SiCortex

SiCortex was a supercomputer manufacturer founded in 2003 and headquartered in Maynard, Massachusetts. On 27 May 2009, "HPCwire" reported that the company had shut down its operations, laid off most of its staff, and is seeking a buyer for its assets. "The Register" reported that Gerbsman Partners was hired to sell SiCortex's intellectual properties. While SiCortex had some sales, selling at least 75 prototype supercomputers to several large customers, the company had never produced an operating profit and ran out of venture capital. New funding could not be found.
The company built and marketed a family of clusters of between 12 and 972 compute nodes, connected in a Kautz graph. The clusters are the SC5832, SC648 and SC072. It was reported that the company has been working on the next generation of clusters since March 2009, but development ceased when operations were closed.
The SC5832 is a high-end model housed in a cabinet. It has 972 nodes, 5,832 cores and 972 to 7,776 GB of memory. It uses a diameter-6 Kautz graph for 2,916 links. The SC648 is a mid-range model housed in a standard 19-inch rack. Each rack may contain two systems. It has 108 nodes, 648 cores and 108 to 864 GB of memory. It uses a diameter-4 Kautz graph for 324 links. The SC072 is a desktop model for developing software. 
Each node is system-on-chip (SoC), codenamed ICE9, consisting of six cores that implement the MIPS64 instruction set architecture (ISA). Each core has a 32 KB instruction cache and a 32 KB data cache. The six cores have their own 256 KB L2 cache, which can be accessed by other cores. The MIPS cores execute instructions in-order and have a six stage pipeline. They can issue and execute two instructions per cycle for peak double-precision (64-bit) performance of 1 GFLOPS at 500 MHz. This was later increased to 1.4 GFLOPS when the clock frequency of the SoC was increased to 700 MHz when the SoC was fabricated in a 90 nm process. The SoC contains two DDR2 memory controllers, each controlling a single DIMM. Each node can have 1 to 8 GB of memory. The SoC also implements a 8x PCI Express controller. The cluster interconnect is implemented by a DMA engine fabric switch. Each cluster interconnect provides a maximum bandwidth of 2 GB/s.
Message passing, via MPI, is the presumptive programming model. SiCortex systems run a customized Linux distribution derived from Gentoo Linux.

A fingerling potato is a small, stubby, finger-shaped type of potato which may be any heritage potato cultivars. Fingerlings are varieties that naturally grow small and narrow. They are fully mature when harvested and are not to be confused with new potatoes. Popular fingerling potatoes include the yellow-skinned Russian Banana, the orange-skinned French, and the Purple Peruvian. Due to their size and greater expense compared to other potatoes, fingerlings are commonly either halved and roasted as a side dish or used in salads.

Still Water (Love)

"Still Water (Love)" is a 1970 hit single written by Smokey Robinson and Frank Wilson, who also produced the track for Motown singing group The Four Tops, who took the song to the top ten of the UK pop charts and to number 11 in the US pop chart. The socially conscious single was a departure from the group's past recordings and produced a smoother sound than the raucous Norman Whitfield productions that belayed on The Temptations. The single features Miracles member Marv Tarplin on guitar and The Andantes adding in additional background vocals shouting out "Still water!" The single became The Tops' first top ten R&B single since 1967's "Bernadette".

Khan al-Tujjar (Nablus)

Khan al-Tujjar () (Arabic transliteration: "Merchant's Caravanserai") is a 15th-century khan in the Palestinian city of Nablus. Situated the Old City, it has been noted as the finest khan in the region.
History.
During the Ottoman period in Palestine, from the 16th to 19th centuries, it was the most prestigious and expensive strip of commercial real estate in Nablus, and along with Khan al-Wikala, constituted the key commercial center of the city. The shops of Khan al-Tujjar carried a variety of cloth from throughout the Islamic world and merchants from India, Baghdad, Mosul, and Aleppo paid regular visits to the marketplace. 
In his memoirs, Muhammad Izzat Darwazah recalled that "In Nablus, shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, in the middle of Nablus." In the 1850s, Reverend John Mills wrote of Khan al-Tujjar saying, "The principal bazaar is arched, and is very large and fine for Nablus. It is the finest, by far, in Palestine, and equals any, as far I observed, in the largest towns of the Turkish Empire." 
The significance of the khan was also attributed to its central location in the city, dividing it in half physically, but also psychologically between "easterners" and "westerners"—labels still used today. During the Nabi Musa festival, Arab youth would descend upon Khan al-Tujjar shouting slogans praising their part of the city. In the middle of the khan they would play a game in which they would face off and make forays into the other side, with the aim capturing more "prisoners". Khan al-Tujjar was a place for celebrating holidays and festivals. During Mawlid, merchants would decorate the floor of the khan with carpets and the walls with textiles, including silk. Flowers and sweets were put on tables brought from their homes on the occasion. 
Khan al-Tujjar was recently restored, and its shops attract visitors from throughout the West Bank. The Yasmeen Hotel is adjacent to Khan al-Tujjar.

Hemiauchenia

Hemiauchenia is a genus of lamine camelids that evolved in North America in the Miocene period approximately 10 million years ago. This genus diversified and moved to South America in the early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange, giving rise to modern lamines. The genus went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. 
Remains of these species have been found in assorted locations around North America including: Florida, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Arizona, Mexico, California, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington. The "large-headed llama", "H. macrocephala", was widely distributed in N. and Central America, with "H. vera" being known from the western U. S. and northern Mexico. "H. minima" has been found in Florida, and "H. guanajuatensis" in Mexico.
Distinguishing characteristics of members of "Hemiauchenia".
 "vera":<br>
• Relatively low-crowned teeth (part of visible teeth ends close to gums) <br>
• Large caniniform upper P1<br>
• Retention of lower P3
"blancoensis":<br>
• Shorter mandibular diastema than "macrocephala" but shorter than "vera"<br>
• Canniform upper P1<br>
• Absent P2 <br>
• Upper P3 present or absent<br>
• Lower crowned molars
"macrocephala":<br>
• Long, robust limbs<br>
• Large skeletal size<br>
• Presence of a deciduous upper P2<br>
• Fully molariform deciduous P2<br>
• High-crowned molars<br>
• Thick layer of cementum on the teeth<br>
• Broad mandibular symphasis with incisors in a vertical fashion
"minima":<br>
• Despite being the earliest recognized species, general distinguishing characteristics for "H. minima" are little known. 
There are also a few lesser known species such as: "H. paradoxa", "H. seymourensis", "H. edensis" and "H. guanajuatensis". According to which source is consulted, these may or may not be considered legitimate taxa.

Josh Reddick

William Joshua Reddick (born February 19, 1987) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played baseball at South Effingham High School in Guyton, Georgia. After playing baseball at Middle Georgia College, he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 17th round of the 2006 MLB Draft. He won his first Gold Glove Award in 2012.
Career.
Boston Red Sox.
On July 31, , Reddick was called up to replace Adam LaRoche, who had been traded. He made his major league debut that night, pinch-hitting for Rocco Baldelli in the ninth inning and grounding out against Cla Meredith of the Baltimore Orioles in his only at-bat. He recorded his first MLB hit in the next game, a double in the second inning off of David Hernandez. He doubled again later in the game against Chris Ray for his first multi-hit major league game.
On August 2, , he hit his first major league home run against Brian Bass. He was the first Red Sox outfielder to hit a home run within his first three games since Billy Conigliaro in 1969.
He was optioned back to the Triple A-Pawtucket Red Sox on August 5. The move allowed a depleted Red Sox bullpen to use Billy Traber's services. He was recalled the very next day when Rocco Baldelli was placed on the disabled list with a left ankle contusion.
He started 2010 in Pawtucket, but was recalled in April 2010 after Mike Cameron went on the DL.
He again started 2011 in Pawtucket but was recalled in May 26, 2011 after Darnell McDonald was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left quad. He was able to stay in the majors after the Red Sox designated Cameron for assignment on June 29, 2011, effectively removing Cameron from the active and 40-man rosters, leaving room for Reddick.
On August 7, 2011, he hit his first MLB walk-off hit against the New York Yankees, driving in Darnell McDonald in the bottom of the 10th inning.
Oakland Athletics.
On December 28, 2011, Reddick and two minor leaguers were traded by the Red Sox to the Oakland Athletics for Andrew Bailey and Ryan Sweeney. Oakland general manager Billy Beane has made a habit of trading closers for talented position players as a part of the "Moneyball" scheme, and was able to flip Bailey, a closer, and Sweeney, who figured to be an extra outfielder for Boston, for a very good young player in Reddick. Reddick played very well for the Oakland A's and impressed Billy Beane. Reddick finished 2012 with 32 home runs (HR) and 85 RBIs, both career highs, as he helped lead the A's to the American League Division Series. He was named the American League right field Gold Glove Award winner on October 30, 2012.
Reddick began the year as the starting right fielder. On May 7, he was placed on the disabled list with a sprained right wrist, and was activated on May 31. Through most of the 2013 season, Reddick failed to retain the power he had from the previous season. Through August 8, he had hit .203 with only five home runs on the season. But on August 9, 2013, Reddick hit 3 home runs in a single game for the first time in his career in a 14-6 rout against the Toronto Blue Jays. On the next day, he homered twice more against Toronto. The total of five home runs in two games tied the Major League record for most home runs in consecutive games. On August 26 Reddick was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an injured right wrist. He returned on September 11. From August 9 to the end of the season, Reddick hit .284/.357/.514 with 7 HR and 19 RBI. In 114 total games, he hit .226/.307/.379 with 12 HR and 56 RBI.
After the season, Reddick underwent arthroscopic surgery on his wrist, which caused him to miss 37 games on the disabled list. Reddick arrived at spring training fully healthy in 2014. On February 15, 2014 Reddick and the Athletics agreed upon a one-year $2.7 million deal, avoiding arbitration.

Suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations

Suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations is the most serious punishment that can be administered to members of the Commonwealth. In the absence of any mechanism by which to expel countries that breach its rules, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) may choose to suspend members from the 'Councils of the Commonwealth', which amounts to the suspension of their formal membership of the organisation, although their participation in activities of the Commonwealth Family of organisations is not necessarily affected.
Four countries have been suspended from the Commonwealth since the inception of the device in 1995: Fiji, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe. Fiji and Pakistan have each been suspended twice, and Zimbabwe has withdrawn permanently from the Commonwealth, whilst Nigeria has rehabilitated entirely.

Khan al-Tujjar (Mount Tabor)

Khan al-Tujjar are the ruins of a caravanserai in the Lower Galilee, Israel, opposite the entrance to Beit Keshet.
History.
The caravanserai was established near Mount Tabor by Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha around 1581. The reason given for its establishment was that the place was insecure for merchants and people making pilgrimage, and it was argued that if a khan was built, the place would become "inhabited and cultivated."
In the early 1760s the Italian traveller Mariti visited the khan, and wrote that: "...you arrive at El-Net-Tesgiar, or the Place of Merchants. I was very much struck with the elegance and magnificence of its walls. Incrusted with the most beautiful marble, which the hand of art has disposed with much taste [..] El-Net-Tesgiar is enlivened by a very flourishing commerce. A fair is held here every Monday, which is resorted to by merchants from various countries. It is well furnished with cloth, cattle, and provisions of every kind; and in this respect it is, indeed, not inferior to the richest markets in Europe.
James Silk Buckingham visited the place in around 1816, and described how, on a Monday, they found four to five thousand people assembled around the Khan, in addition to numerous herds of cattle.
The American scholar Edward Robinson visited in 1838, a day after the weekly Monday fair which had "drawn away from their home a large portion of the people of Nazareth". As Buckingham, he describes two large buildings, one a Khan, and one building looking more like a castle.
In the mid-1850s, W. M. Thomson made a lively description of a marked day there:On Monday of each week a great fair is held at the khans, when, for a few hours, the scene is very lively and picturesque. These gatherings afford an excellent opportunity to observe Syrian manners, customs, and costumes, and to become acquainted with the character and quality of Syrian productions. Thousands of people assemble from all parts of the country, either to sell, trade or purchase. Cotton is brought in bales from Nablus; barley, and wheat, and sesamum, and Indian corn from Huleh, the Hauran, and Esdraelon. From Gilead and Bashan, and the surrounding districts, come horses and donkeys, cattle and flocks, with cheese, "leben, semen", honey and similar articles. Then there are miscellaneous matters, such as chicken and eggs, figs, raisins, apples, melons, grapes and all sorts of fruits and vegetables in season. The pedlars open their packages of tempting fabrics, the jeweller is there with his trinkets; the tailor with his ready-made garments; the shoemaker with his stock, from rough, hairy sandals to yellow and red Morocco boots; the farrier is there with his tools, nails, and flat iron shoes, and drives a prosperous business for a few hours; and so does the saddler, with his coarse sacks and gaily-trimmed cloths. And thus it is with all the arts and occupations known to this people... But long before sunset not a soul of this busy throng remains on the spot. All return home, or to take refuge in some neighbouring village.

In the other Regional Semifinal, unseeded Washington stunned overall #2 seeded Nebraska in four sets (25-16, 20-25, 25-21, 29-27). The fourth set of the match was considered controversial. Washington held a set point on which they hit a shot which might have been touched by the Nebraska block, but was ruled out, allowing Nebraska to tie up the set. Then Nebraska held a set point on which a kill attempt by Washington landed near the back line and was called in by the line judge, allowing Washington to tie up the set. Nebraska players and coaches were visibly upset as they thought they had won the point and started to celebrate. Washington then scored the next two points and won the match. When Nebraska head coach John Cook shook hands with Washington head coach Jim McLaughlin, he allegedly said "The ball was out. Nice Match" to which McLaughlin allegedly responded with foul language and had to be restrained. Both the controversial call and the coach incident were hot topics on the news outlets.

War in Somalia (2009–present)

The 2009–present phase of the Somali Civil War is concentrated in southern Somalia. It began in early February 2009, with the conflict between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops and various militant Islamist groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen sectarian violence between the moderate Sufis ASWJ, and the Islamists Al-Shabaab.
In 2011, a coordinated military operation between the Somali military and multinational forces began. The mission was officially led by the Somali army, with analysts expecting the additional AU troop reinforcements to help the Somali authorities gradually expand their territorial control.
Background.
Established in 2004 and internationally recognized, the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) support in Somalia was waning until the United States-backed 2006 intervention by the Ethiopian military, which helped drive out the rival Islamic Courts Union (ICU) in Mogadishu and solidify the TFG's rule. Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an underequipped African Union (AU) peacekeeping force. A power sharing deal ensued between an Islamist splinter group led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia Djibouti faction (ARS-D) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in Djibouti. Al-Shabaab, which had separated from the moderate Islamists of the insurgency, rejected the peace deal and continued to take territories. It was joined by Hizbul Islam, which is an amalgamation of four Islamist group including the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia – Asmara faction. Another Islamist group, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, which was allied with the TFG and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al-Shabaab and take over towns as well although they have been effective only in the central region of Galguduud, where they ousted al-Shabaab from most of the region.
After the parliament took in 275 officials from the moderate Islamist opposition, ARS leader Sheikh Ahmed was elected TFG President on 31 January 2009. Since then, the al-Shabaab radical Islamists have accused the new TFG President of accepting the secular transitional government and have continued the civil war since he arrived in Mogadishu at the presidential palace in early February 2009.
Timeline.
Islamist-ARS/TFG coalition conflict.
On 4 February 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys' Eritrean branch of the ARS merged and created the group Hisbi Islam, to fight the new government of Sharif Ahmed. al-Shabaab also vowed to fight the government. On 8 February 2009, they declared war on the new government of Sharif Ahmed and the AU peace-keepers.
New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on 7 February 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government.
On 8 February, heavy fighting broke out in southern Mogadishu. al-Shabaab leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur).
met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to Mogadishu, while Omar Iman rejected the president. During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce Sharia Law in Somalia, which is currently the radical groups' main demand. However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former Al-Shabab spokesman, denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned Nigeria against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab views the AU peace keepers as occupying forces and will continue fighting them until they withdraw from the country.
On 10 February, al-Shabaab launched an offensive to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital were they started a battle against government forces.
In Galmudug, Clan militia took the town of Masagaway from al-Shabaab. There was also fighting in Warsheekh.
On 12 February, the spokesman for al-Shabaab, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. He also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an “apostate" government. The same day, they vowed war against the new government.
On 22 February, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen.
At the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the north-west, in fighting that killed another 20 people: 10 TFG soldiers, 6 insurgents and 4 civilians.
On 28 February, it appeared that Hisbi Islam would sign a ceasefire with the Transitional Federal Government. However, by 1 March, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President Sharif Ahmed having agreed to proposals for a truce and having offered to accept the implementation of Sharia Law but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so.
On 6 May, al-Shabaab announced that it would continue the war even if AMISOM withdrew.
25 May, the government announced an immediate blockade on airstrips and seaports under insurgent control to stop the flow of weapons reaching them.
On 7 May, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced. By 11 May, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking over most of the capital. Fighting continued until 14 May and, though they came close, the rebels didn't manage to overthrow the government. There were new rounds of fighting all through August.
16 May, al-Shabaab captured the strategic town of Jowhar, which connects Mogadishu with central Somalia.
5 June, Hizbul Islam captured Wabho in one of the largest battles of the war, which left 123 combatants killed. It was also rumoured Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was injured in this battle.
On 19 June, the transitional parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe asked the international community to send foreign troops to Somalia within the following 24 hours. He stated that the government's power is on the verge of being defeated by Islamist forces in the Somali capital. The Cabinet declared a state of emergency and Somalia asked for help from neighbors Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen. Ethiopia refused saying intervention needs an international mandate. On 21 June, a spokesman for the al-Shabaab Islamists said they would fight any foreign troops. al-Qaeda also made threats against Kenyan intervention.
22 June, Somali President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed declared state of emergency in the country as a new round of fighting in Mogadishu left 12 dead and 20 injured. Hundreds were said to be fleeing the city
4 July, Sheik Abdinasir Jalil, a former commander of the training for ICU administration in Beledweyn town joined Hizbul Islam with his men and vowed to fight TFG forces in the city and attack Ethiopian forces in El-gal village, which lies 18 km from Beledweyn. He said that the government officials want to bring Ethiopian troops inside town and that is the reason they switched sides. Former ICU officials who joined Hizbul Islam, held a press conference and announced that the ICU administration in Hiraan had collapsed as they joined the insurgents. Sheikh Ibrahim Yusuf, a top security commander in Beledweyn, also defected along with his forces. General Muktar Hussein Afrah was sent to Beledweyn along with TFG troops and put in charge there by the TFG as the ICU administration had collapsed. Many ICU officials including MPs resigned that day next to Sheikh Abdinasir Jalil Ahmed (head of training) and Sheikh Ibrahim Yusuf (head of security); Sheik Osman Abdulle Barqadle, the army commander of Ugas Khalif airport, and Sheik Abdullahi Garamgaram, the deputy chief of the emergency forces also resigned.
In response, TFG forces led by general Muktar Hussein Afrah started military manoeuvers in the East side of the city.
6 July, Sheikh Moktar Ali Zubeyr, the Amir of al-Shabaab gave government forces an ultimatum of 5 days to hand over their weapons. The ultimatum was rejected by Indho Ade.
17 July, two French security advisors to the government were captured by insurgents. The Somali government gave permission for French commandos to launch operations inside Somalia to free the 2 French nationals that held by al-Shabaab. On 22 July, French warships and helicopters were seen near the ports of Mogadishu and Marka as France declared they would undertake military operations to free the two French military advisers who had been captured by insurgents. One hostage, Marc Aubriere, escaped a month later in August 2009. The second, Denis Allex, was seen in a video released in June 2010 asking for assistance to effect his release.
On 15 September, a helicopter raid conducted by the US military killed 6, including a key Al-Qaida member, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.
Al-Shabaab-Hizbul Islam conflict.
The armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed "Madoobe" and al-Shabaab, over a power sharing agreement in Kisimayo. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place. This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as its ARS-A and JABISO factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan "Turki" refusing to back Ahmad "Madoobe" and instead siding with al-Shabaab.
On 1 October, heavy fighting broke out. By the afternoon, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with 12 dead and 70 wounded. At least 17 people were killed in during a series of battles overnight on 5 October. A Hizbul Islam spokesman claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle. The battle was decisively won by al-Shabaab which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city.
Throughout November 2009, fighting between the two factions continued in Southern Somalia and as result insurgent attacks in Mogadishu targeting TFG and AMISOM forces decreased. However Sheikh Ahmad Madobe's forces were soon overpowered by al-Shabaab and its local allies and forced to withdraw from the Lower Jubba region and most of Southern Somalia. In February 2010, Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades declared a merge with al-Shabaab. He encouraged other groups in Hizbul Islam also to join al-Shabaab.
In early 2010 the two groups clashed in Hiran region, in central Somalia. This battle was also won by al-Shabaab which took control of the region. In late 2010 they also expelled Hizbul Islam from Bay region after seizing control of Bur Hakab, after a two days battle in which 30 militants were killed. In Lower Shabelle region al-Shabaab seized control of Hizbul Islam strongholds: Furuqley, Farsooley and Dugulle villages and then started preparing an offensive in Afgooye, the last town Hizbul Islam controlled in the region. Soon after Hizbul Islam was forced to surrender the Luuq District in Gedo region to al-Shabaab, after which it was announced that Hizbul Islam would merge with al-Shabaab. From mid-December al-Shabaab fighters started taking over Hizbul Islam positions. Hizbul Islam fighters also started entering al-Shabaab controlled areas of Mogadishu. The merge was confirmed on 20 December, when Hizbul Islam Chairman Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Mohammad Osman Arus, the organisation's official spokesman, surrendered to al-Shabaab and disbanded the organisation.
Galmudug and Islamists.
Government officials from the Galmudug administration in the north-central Hobyo district also reportedly attempted to use pirate gangs as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents from southern Somalia's conflict zones. Other pirates are alleged to have reached agreements of their own with the Islamist groups, although a senior commander from the Hizbul Islam militia vowed to eradicate piracy by imposing sharia law when his group briefly took control of Harardhere in May 2010 and drove out the local pirates.
Battle of Gashandiga.
An early 2011 offensive was dubbed by AU Representative Wafula Wamunyinyi as the "Battle of Gashandiga."
In 20 February 2011, it was reported that AMISOM troops destroyed a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, and killed six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu. Two AMISOM troops died in those battles.
On 21 February, at least 20 people, including TFG policemen were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in Mogadishu.
Between 21 and 22 February, twelve people were killed in heavy shelling in Mogadishu.
On 25 February, 15 people were killed as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory in Mogadishu. Additionally, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers.
On 26 February, an offensive by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers was opened in the southern Somali town of Bula Hawo. Until 28 February, 33 people were killed in TFG and Ethiopian shelling.
By 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits, while the Bakaara Market, where many of the goods were bound to be sold, was controlled by the insurgents. It was reported that by 5 March, up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes. Of those, 43 Burundian and 10 Ugandan.
By 16 March, AMISOM was bolstered by an additional 1,000 peacekeepers to assist in the TFG's renewed offensive against al-Shabaab, bringing the total manpower of AMISOM to nearly 9,000.
Defeat of Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu.
"For main article see Battle of Mogadishu (2010–11)"
On 6 August 2011, the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of Baidoa. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have suggested that the pullout may at least in part have been caused by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization.
After their withdrawal, al-Shabaab has however continued hit and run tactics in the North of the city as they vowed to continue guerilla attacks in Mogadishu. On 4 October 2011, a suicide bomb on a lorry detonated and killed more than 70 people near a compound housing several government ministries. Two weeks later a car bomb killed at least two people.
On 11 October 2011, AU troops claimed to have driven the remnants of al-Shabaab out of the city. As of November 2012, Mogadishu was still firmly in AMISOM and TFG hands, although the city continued to suffer from suicide bomb attacks.
Fighting in Puntland.
On 2 to 3 September, fighting was reported in Puntland that resulted in the deaths of up to 60 people, including 8 Puntland soldiers and 40 Al-Shabaab militants, with Insurgents being repelled. Al-Shabaab claimed on 7 September that they have captured 2 Kenyan troops who were on a surveillance mission near the Kenyan-Somalian Border. Puntland forces captured 18 members of Al-Shabaab in counter-terrorism operations on 8 September.
Battle of Elwaq.
Al-Shabaab attacked the southern town of Elwaq on 10 September, resulting in the deaths of 12 insurgents and soldiers. The next day, Somali troops fought back, retaking the town after militants fled on captured technicals. The bodies of 30 militants were later found, some of them children. Conversely, Al-Shabaab claimed they killed around 70 government aligned troops and captured 10 technicals.
The Burundian military lost 51 soldiers in October, causing anger among Burundians, who believe that their country is sacrificing too much. Many Burundians have urged other AU members to contribute troops to the Somalia mission. Nigeria, Djibouti, and Guinea have indicated sending troops, but all have yet to contribute.
Kismayo offensive.
On 4 September 2012 the Kenyan Navy shelled Kismayo. This was part of an AU offensive to capture the city from al-Shabab fighters. The harbour was shelled two times and the airport three times. According to a UN report the export of charcoal through Kismayo is a major source of income for al-Shabab.
On 28 September 2012, the Somali National Army assisted by AMISOM troops and Ras Kamboni militia launched an assault on Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold. The allied forces reportedly managed to re-capture much of the city from the insurgents.
Foreign involvement.
African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).
"See Main AMISOM article"
The African Union has deployed more than 16,000 soldiers to Somalia, mandated to support transitional governmental structures, implement a national security plan, train the Somali security forces, and assist in creating a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid. As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Transitional Federal Government's forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants.
AMISOM was created by the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 19 January 2007 with an initial six month mandate. On 21 February 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved the mission's mandate. Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorised by the United Nations Security Council.
AMISOM's UN mandate was extended for a further six months in August 2008 by UNSCR 1831. The AMISOM’s mandate has been extended each period that it has been up for review. It is currently set to be reviewed again on 16 January 2013.
On 12 November 2013, the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 2124 (2013) extending AMISOM's mandate from 28 February 2014 to 31 October 2014. Acting upon the force's request, the resolution also increases AMISOM's maximum authorized strength from 17,731 to 22,126 troops.
The force, which has been reportedly engaged in fighting in Mogadishu and throughout the country, has reportedly suffered significant casualties during their mission, although no precise figures have issued by the contributing countries.
United States and UN.
The United National Development Program for Somalia spends about $50 million each year, though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER). As of October 2010, the U.S. State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body.
In January 2013, the U.S. announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the Department of State, the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process.
At the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year arms embargo on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. On April 9, 2013, the U.S. government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. At the request of the Somali authorities and AMISOM, the U.S. military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces.
Ethiopia.
2009.
On 16 February, Somali MP Mohamud Sayid Adan, former Mogadishu mayor Mohamed Omar Habeeb and local police officer Hassan Dhicisow, were arrested by Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolow in Gedo region.
On 28 May, 2 Ethiopian soldiers, 1 Ethiopian civilian, 2 Somali soldiers, 4 Somali civilians (working for the government) and 4 Somali insurgents were killed when insurgents attacked a convoy carrying Omar Hashi Aden, who was returning from his visit to Ethiopia.

Sheik Hassan Ya'qub Ali, head of the information affairs for Islamic administration in Kisimayo warned the Ethiopians that "there is no candy and dates to eat from here in Somalia. But the men who chased you forcibly from the country are here in Somalia."
The suicide bombing on 18 June targeted a meeting between TFG and Ethiopian commanders.
On 19 June, Ethiopian forces entered Bakool and reached Elberde town. They withdrew after holding talks with local clan elders.

18 July, Ethiopian forces vacated their bases in Yed Village in insurgent-controlled Bakool region.
During the weekend of 29–30 August, Ethiopian forces advanced to Beledweyne, supporting a government offensive on the insurgent part of, Beledweyne. They withdrew on 31 August. The assault on Beledweyne by government forces came as the TFG governor of Hiraan (belonging to Sharif Ahmed's ARS-Djibouti faction), Sheikh Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma'ow, which controls the other part of Beledweyne, withdrew his administration's support for the TFG.
2010.
19 March, Mohammed wali Odowa, spokesman of Hizbul Islam's Hiraan administration in Beledweyne, threatened that Hizbul Islam forces would attack any Ethiopian forces which entered Hizbul Islam controlled territories in Hiraan.
20 May, Ethiopian forces seized control of the previously al-Shabaab held towns of Yeed and Elbarde, in Bakool region. Al-Shabaab had captured Elbarde from the TFG on 20 April.
On 18 July, Ethiopian forces withdrew from all their bases in Hiraan and Bakool regions. Ethiopian forces had held these territories for two months, during which they clashed several times with al-Shabaab forces which control most of Hiraan. Before they withdrew they released over 20 lorries which used to travel between the South and Central regions of Somalia.
On 1 August, 27,000 Ethiopian troops entered Somalia through the border town of Dolo, where 6,000 Ethiopian forces are based. They advanced deep into Gedo region in the direction of the towns of Beledehawa and Elwak, accompanied by militia of pro-Ethiopian, Somali warlords. In Hiraan, Ethiopian forces which entered along with TFG-forces exchanged fire with al-Shabaab militants and advanced until the Kalaber junction, near Beledweyne. The Ethiopian troops then withdrew to Ferfer.
On 29 August, there was a second Ethiopian incursion. A large number of Ethiopian forces in military vehicles, accompanied by highly trained TFG forces, entered several villages in al-Shabaab controlled Hiraan region. This came at a time when al-Shabaab militants regularly ventured near the border. Hussein Abdallah, an ASWJ loyalist claimed that the movements were a preliminary action to signal that Ethiopian authorities are able of weakening the Islamist insurgents, to al-Shabaab's leadership.
On 1 September, Ethiopian forces moved deeper into Gedo region, via Dolow, entering the TFG-held village of Yeed. TFG officials in the region reported they were planning to capture the entire Bay and Bakool regions from al-Shabaab.
On 30 December, TFG forces clashed with Ethiopian troops in the Jawil district, near Beledweyne, after Ethiopian forces took a TFG soldier into custody. One TFG soldier and one civilian were injured in the clashes.
2011.
3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa official Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, complained about Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were doing this because they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability.
On 19 November, eyewitness reported large number of Ethiopian troops crossing into Somalia. Ethiopian authorities denied this.
After a multinational conference held on 25 November in Addis Ababa, IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces' campaign against Al-Shabaab.
On 31 December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked Beledweyne in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting. They later took control of Baidoa, among other areas.
2012.
On 22 October 2012, the Spokesman of African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) Col. Ali Aden Humed speaking to journalists in Mogadishu on Saturday said that Ethiopian forces present in parts of the regions of Somalia will soon pull out from the country.
The spokesman said AMISOM troops will take over the areas where Ethiopian forces are holding at the moment. “The plan by AMISOM is to take over the positions held by Ethiopian forces in parts of the regions of the country, Ethiopian troops will soon retreat back to their position along Somalia border” said Col. Ali Aden Humed.
2013.
In 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom announced that Ethiopian troops were pulling out of Baidoa as the situation on the ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting Al-Shabaab. Following the Westgate shooting in Nairobi by Al Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted its plans to withdraw completely out of Somalia. In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members.
Kenya.
Recruitment from Kenya.
According to press reports, Somali and Kenyan government officials have recruited and trained Somali refugees in Kenya and Kenyan nationals who are ethnic Somalis to fight insurgents in Somalia. However, the Somali chief of military staff and spokesmen from the Kenyan government have denied this.
2010 Kenya-Al-Shabaab border clash.
On 20 July 2010 border clashes between Kenya and Al-Shabaab insurgents occurred when gunmen from the militia attacked a Kenyan border patrol along the border area in Liboi, Lagdera. There was a subsequent fierce exchange of fire between the two sides leading to the deaths of 2 militia and the wounding of one Kenyan officer. Hundreds of security personnel were later deployed to the border following the clash and because of continued fighting between two militia groups in the neighbouring town of Dobley, Somalia. The Islamist outfit had previously claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing in Uganda in July.
Operation Linda Nchi.
In October 2011, a coordinated operation between the Somali military and the Kenyan military began against the Al-Shabaab group of insurgents in southern Somalia. The mission was officially led by the Somali army, with the Kenyan forces providing a support role. In early June 2012, Kenyan forces were formally integrated into AMISOM. Analysts expect the additional AU troop reinforcements to help the Somali authorities gradually expand their territorial control.

Church of Holy Salvation, Cetina

The Church of the Holy Salvation () is a Pre-Romanesque church in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. The exact location of the church is in a small village of Cetina, in inland of Dalmatian Zagora, on spring of river Cetina, 8 km northwest from the town of Vrlika.
This church is one of the most important in Croatia, as it is the pre-schism church constructed with a bell tower which is still standing.
Description.
It was a large stone church for that period. The church is a one-longitudinal-nave structure with a sanctuary consisting of three apses, in the form of a trefoil. Later, the middle apse was pulled down and substituted by a bigger, rectangular one. The church has strong semi-circular buttresses that give a feeling of fortification, emphasized with mighty bell-tower positioned in front of entrance, creating a westwork.
History.
The church was built near Vrlika, called "Vrh Rike" in the 9th-10th century. It was dated to the time of Duke Branimir of Dalmatian Croatia through comparative analysis of an altar beam with other artefacts carrying Branimir's name by Ivo Petricioli in 1980 and 1984.
It is one of the oldest and best preserved larger monuments of the early Croatian pre-Romanesque sacral architecture.
The church was built by the local "župan" (district-prefect) Gastika of Cetina, at the recommendation of Pope Stephen VI, but as a private church, built in memory of his family.
During the excavation work, several architectural fragments and pieces of stone furnishings adorned with the Croatian interlace have been found. The most important is the fragment of a beam with semi-uncial inscriptions from it is known that the church had been dedicated to Christ and built on the order of the prefect Gastika, the son of Nemira.
The graves found near the Church, dated to the 9th through 14th century, had a specific kind of textile that was found to be comparable in quality with 18th and 19th century clothing.
There are over 1,026 old Croatian graves around the church of great archaeological interest. Several tombs have been found in the church itself, most of which (more than 800) originally had stećci. The culture of that time was influenced by the Frankish Empire, which was noticed in the archaeological findings from the period and the structure of the church.
In the early 15th century, Hrvoje Vukčić strengthened the Prozor Fortress, and most of the inhabitants moved out of Vrh Rika into Vrlika. The fortress subsequently belonged to Ivaniš Nelipac, Ivan Frankopan and Mihača Nikolin Vitturi. After a 1492 invasion by the Ottoman Empire, the church and the settlement sustained heavy damage and a substantial part of the inhabitants fled to Turopolje.
The Serb Orthodox Eparchy of Dalmatia published a conflicting assessment of the origin of the Holy Salvation, originally published by Mirko Ležaić in 1939 in Belgrade, saying Tvrtko I built it, and that it was destroyed by the Turks in 1512.
The 17th century saw new inhabitants from Bosnia (Ottoman Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Roman Catholic Croats and Croatian Greek Catholic) settle in the area near the church. Most of them where Orthodox, whose graves today are mixed with the old Croatian graves.
The church was mostly used as a Catholic Church, except for the time between World War II and the Croatian War of Independence when it was also used as an Orthodox Church.

Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard

Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard (29 January 1766, Paris – 30 September 1823), known as Publicola Chaussard, was a French writer, art critic, poet, revolutionary, politician and follower of Theophilanthropy. According to Michaud in his "Biographie universelle", Chaussard was "a writer who would perhaps have failed to make a lasting reputation if he had lived under other circumstances".
Family.
Pierre Chaussard was the son of the architect Jean-Baptiste Chaussard (1729–1818) and of Anne Michelle Chevotet, daughter of the royal architect Jean-Michel Chevotet. He was also the great nephew of Jean Valade, peintre du roi, and close cousin to Agathe de Rambaud and Benoît Mottet de La Fontaine. Pierre-Jean-Baptiste was thus raised amidst a family moving in noble circles, close to major aristocrats who were witnesses at his marriage. His father's architecture, however, went out of fashion and he did not work at all after 1789, with most of his clients emigrating or being guillotined.

Jean Valade

Jean Valade (1710 - 12 December 1787) was a French painter and pastel artist of the Rococo movement, specializing in portraiture.
Early life.
He was born in Poitiers. Valade was the son of Léonard who was also a painter and Marie Bellot. He trained with his father before moving to Paris in 1739. He married Gabrielle Louise Remond, 20 November 1752, and has no descendants. His great nephew was Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard.

He became a student of Charles-Antoine Coypel, official Painter to the King and theorist, a member of the French School. Valade was later appointed painter to the king. He participated in numerous exhibitions between 1751 and 1781. Denis Diderot published several negative reviews of her portraits. In 1769, he denounced Valade at the Salon, because in his view " is not a poor painter, but a very poor painter, because you can not do two jobs at once."

The team did not improve on their previous output of 0–7, losing all six games they played bringing their losing streak up to 17 games. Hence, they were winless for two consecutive seasons. This feat would be duplicated by the 1943 and 1944 Chicago Cardinals; however, the NFL does not consider that to be the longest losing streak, as the Cardinals combined with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1944 season. As a traveling team, they played all six games on the road, finishing twelfth in the league. The franchise folded after the season, losing its final seventeen games spanning three seasons. During this stretch, the team was outscored 301–22. With the team's folding, the NFL lost is longest-lasting traveling team (1920–1929), and the final traveling team until the Dallas Texans in 1952.
The Dayton Triangles were limited to only seven points throughout the entire season. This was the final team in NFL history to score under ten points in a season. This dubious feat had been accomplished nineteen times prior to this season's Dayton Triangle's performance. This was the Triangle's third time (1925, 1928, 1929) to record a single-digit season scoring output, tying the Louisville Brecks (1921, 1923, 1926) for this dubious record.
They were coached by Faye Abbott, his second and final season of coaching. Abbott had previously played for the Triangles; between coaching and playing, he participated in 70 of the Triangles' 77 games as a franchise. The franchise was winless under Abbott's head coaching. With the franchise folding, Abbott would be the team's fourth and final head coach.
Their lone touchdown and scoring play of the season was scored on a fumble recovery by Left Guard Al Graham.

Bomb Pop

Bomb Pops are a frozen confection currently manufactured by Blue Bunny. The original flavor contains Cherry, Lime, and Blue Raspberry flavorings. There are ten main Bomb Pop flavors. The current Bomb Pop flavors are Original, Original Jr., Lickety Lix, Fudge, Tongue Splashers, Cherry Jr., Sour Power Jr., Jolly Rancher, Sour Cherry Tear Jerkers, and Watermelon
History.
Bomb Pops were invented by James S. Merritt and D.S. Abernethy in Kansas City, Missouri on July 30, 1955. When D.S Abernethy's company Merritt Foods closed down, Wells' Dairy bought the business including Bomb Pops.
In 1999, Stephen Labaton of "The New York Times" used bombpop.com as an example of why there needs to be new rules to protect children's privacy. Any child that wanted to win a Nintendo Game Boy had to fill out their personal information including their address.
In 2003, The Walt Disney Company made a deal with Wells' Dairy to release Buzz Lightyear Bomb Pops.
Blue Bunny celebrated Bomb Pops' 50th anniversary in 2005 by starting a sweepstakes. The sweepstakes included giving a trip to Disneyland to two winners and giving 50 winners a Game Boy Advance. The 50th anniversary was also the start of National Bomb Pop Day which is celebrated on the last Thursday in June.
Health.
Wells Dairy released Sugar Free Bomb Pops that have few calories, few carbohydrates, and no fat. The newspaper "Western Kansas Word" said that it is a good choice for people with diabetes. The flavor is the original.

Lewis Hogg

Lewis Hogg (born 13 September 1982) is an English footballer who plays for Gloucester City as a midfielder.
Career.
Born in Bristol, Hogg started his career out at Bristol Rovers, rising from the youth team to the first team in 1999. He failed to record an appearance in his first year, but by his second year he was a stalwart in the midfield and was named team captain by manager Garry Thompson. However soon after Thompson left the club, Hogg saw his time dwindle until he was eventually released by the club in the summer of 2003. In total, Hogg appeared in 74 league games, scoring 3 times for the Pirates. He also made 17 additional cup appearances, scoring an additional 3 goals, including a memorable equaliser at Goodison Park against Premier League side Everton in the League Cup.
After leaving Bristol Rovers, Hogg found his way to Barnet where he appeared 16 times in half a season, scoring for them once against Leigh Genesis F.C. While with Barnet, Hogg represented England at the non-league level.
Hogg was quickly on the move again, joining Conference South side Weston-super-Mare in December 2003. He quickly found himself as a midfield force for The Seagulls and spent two and a half years at Woodspring Stadium.
It came with much surprise that Hogg wanted to move to Bath City in the summer of 2006, dropping down a league in the process. After the clubs were unable to agree on a fee, an independent tribunal decided on a £4000 fee to be paid to Weston-super-Mare for Hogg's signature.
Once at Bath City, Hogg was a hit. Despite having a less than stellar disciplinary record, Hogg has proven to be quite a pickup for the Twerton Park side. In his first season with Bath City, he saw the team promoted to the Conference South. His former club Weston-super-Mare took notice of "the one that got away" as well, putting in a £2,000 bid on New Year's Eve 2008 for the midfielder, which Bath manager Adie Britton rejected.
He departed Bath following the club's relegation to the Conference South after signing for Gloucester City of the Conference North in June 2012.

Standard Oil Building, also known as the Stanbalt Building, is a historic office building located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a 15-story Beaux Arts skyscraper designed by Clyde N. Friz (1867-1942), one of Baltimore’s best-known Beaux Arts designers, and built in 1922. The steel-frame "U"-shaped office building is clad in limestone. It was built by the Standard Oil Company at a time when that business was once of the nation’s principal corporations, the dominant supplier of gasoline and fuels.
Standard Oil Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. In its later years as an office building, the building primarily housed offices for the City of Baltimore. Following an extensive, $25 million renovation, the building reopened as residential apartments in 2002.

Ant nest beetle

Ant nest beetles (subfamily Paussinae) or paussines, some members of which are known also as flanged bombardier beetles, are a large subfamily within the ground beetles (Carabidae). Rarely seen, most Paussinae are obligate or facultative myrmecophiles, living within the nests of ants, predatory on ant larvae and workers. Many have elaborate antennal structures and body parts flattened. Paussines are moderate sized (6–20 mm), characterised by glandular hairs that produce secretions attractive to ants and by the odd antennal structures of many species. Their pygidial glands can produce explosive secretions, giving them the other name of flanged bombardier beetles although they are not particularly close relatives of the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae).
Biology.
Very little is known about the immature stages of ant nest beetles. Most appear to live in ant nests in their early stages of life. Although many are facultative or obligate myrmecophiles, most do not appear like ants (i.e. myrmecomorphic) and unlike in the case of myrmecophilous larval Lycaenidae, there appears to be no benefit gained by the ants in this association. Many species follow the trails of worker ants of specific species. Glandular secretions on their antennae and body allow them to interact with ant workers. The defensive bombardier behaviour is never used against ants. Males of some species are attracted to lights during some parts of the season and are thought to disperse from one ant nest to another. Males are thought to be short-lived. These beetles feed on ant eggs, larvae and adults by piercing their mandibles into the abdomen or other soft part and sucking the contents. Apart from chemical mimicry and communication with their hosts, they also make use of vibrations. Several stridulatory structures are found in these beetles including alary-elytral, abdomen-femur and thorax-femur combinations of surfaces.
Systematics.
The subfamily Paussinae contains 49 genera, with around 800 species divided into the following tribes and subtribes:
While some tribes like Metriini and Ozaenini appear quite similar to typical carabids, others have modified antennae and body shapes. The Protopaussini and Paussini are slender or compact in body shape with enlarged antennae in the Paussini.
Tribe Paussini.
Subtribe Carabidomemnina Wasmann, 1928
Subtribe Cerapterina Billberg, 1820
Subtribe Heteropaussina Janssens, 1953
Subtribe Homopterina Janssens, 1953
Subtribe Paussina Latreille, 1807

Pensacola Police Department

The Pensacola Police Department (or PPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for Pensacola, Florida in the United States. The department was founded on July 18, 1821 by Gen. Andrew Jackson, who had appointed city constable (policeman) to keep order within the city. On July 17, Jackson had entered Pensacola to accept the territory of East and West Florida for the United States. The following day, he established the government within the city.
The current Chief of Police is Chip Simmons.
History.
Early history.
The history of the Pensacola Police Department goes back to the finding of Pensacola led by Tristan De Luna. When De Luna was establishing Pensacola with more than a 1,500 people they needed protection from future invaders and any other possible threats, so they built Fort Barrancas. Sadly the establishment didn't last long because of the hurricanes that hit the area. Many tried to re-establish what was the settlement of De Luna. So in 1692 Admiral Andre de Pez claimed the area that was known by the Native Americans as Panzacola. The Spanish fought for this area and was claimed by the Spanish, French, and English (all in separate times of history). Later on Fort Pickens and Fort San Miguel was established.
Later history.
Later on in Pensacola's history many of the soldiers that had fought in the many battles and wars of Pensacola established the Pensacola Police Department. Many rules for the police officers were also established including the following:
Departmental organization.
Currently the PPD has approximately 150 sworn police officers divided into four divisions:
Canine unit.
The Pensacola Police Department is recognized as having one of the best trained canine units in the United States. At the annual USPCA Police Dog Field Trials—the largest competition of police dogs in the United States—Pensacola police dog "Uno" took second place in the 2013 competition, and "Charief" took fourth place in 2012.

Antonello Padovano

Antonello Padovano, is an Italian film director and producer.
Biography.
After discovering the magic of cinema through director Fellini, on the set of "And the Ship Sails On", he purchased a Beauliey R/16 mm camera with his savings and set off for New York City. Once in New York he traveled through the streets of the South Bronx and created a documentary on the "Waste Land" inspired by the work of Thomas Stearns Eliot. In New York he had the luck to meet Dizzy Gillespie and Salvatore Scarpitta, two artists who would remain a great inspiration for him.
On his return to Italy, he continued studying at the University of Art in Rome (La Sapienza) where he met the French actress Annie Girardot and soon directed another documentary on her work using a group of young actors.
Soon after he was commissioned to direct his first documentary for the Rai, titled "Sweet Harmonica Dreams", which he created in Jersey during the first Harmonica World Championships, with the participation of Larry Adler, Peter Madcat Ruth, Don Baker and Roland Van Straaten. He continued to work for the Rai, directing a documentary called "Religion and Fashion" that focused on the attraction for fashion between priests and nuns. This very controversial work captured the attention of national newspapers like "La Repubblica".
Within a short time he traveled to Yemen creating a documentary titled "Wedding in Yemen", revealing the true story of a man who would see the face of his future wife for the first time on the night of their wedding. When he returned from Yemen he made a series of 6 documentaries in 35 mm with a movie crew, in the most beautiful historic city centers of Italy. After this work he returned to Yemen to begin work on the documentary titled the "String of Pearls" and in Jordan (Petra) he created a short film called "Once upon a time", a story inspired by the "One thousand and one nights". This was followed by meetings in Cannes with executives from NHK Japan to produce and direct two documentaries connected to the political changes in Northern Italy.
He was then commissioned to direct another documentary for Mixer by Giovanni Minoli about the diary of a girl whose life was saved by a transplant from an organ donated by her sister. Luciano Pavarotti participated in the documentary. Padovano continued to direct and produce documentaries for Rai 1. "The Awakening" captured the story of an autistic boy with the amazing ability to recognise every single car model manufactured, "Ray of Hope" is the story of a young girl and her struggle to cope with cerebral cancer, "Hearts" is the emotional story about a couple in love who both need heart transplants, and "Born Twice", the controversial story of a professional well-known father and husband who decides to become a woman by undergoing a sex change operation in London. All the documentaries received critical acclaim and more than 6 million viewers.
After these experiences he traveled 'under cover' to Armenia with Baroness Caroline Cox of the House of Lords. In the worst days of the conflict in Nagomo Karabah he told the story of "The Prisoner in the Cellar". This incredible story follows an Armenian woman who holds an Azeri officer hostage in the cellar of her home in Stephanakert.
He soon created a series of historical documentaries: "Who Killed Olof Palme?" on the assassination of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme, "Edward and Mrs Simpson", with King Edward's best friend's son David Metcalfe, and "The Last Survivors of the Titanic" where he interviewed some of the last remaining survivors from that fateful voyage. In New Zealand he created "Everest", with the participation of Sir Edmund Hilary, and "Transplant", a story based on the first heart transplant with the participation of Christian Barnard.
He was soon requested to create a series for the Real Film programme live, experiencing a new type of story that experimented with a new form of reporting. He then directed "The Baby of the Night", the story of a boy with a rare disease that doesn't allow him to go out in sunlight; "A Uterus for Rent", the tragic confession of a woman who is pregnant with someone else's baby; "Beautiful", a hallucinatory journey into the world of beauty contestants; "Help", on the desperate condition of a group of people waiting for a heart donation; and "Auschwitz", a journey in the night to the concentration camp with survivor Nedo Fiano. Then he created a story based on the falling down of the Noto Cathedral, dedicated to the defence of the baroque heritage with the participation of Andrea Bocelli.
He then started the project "Mysterious Places". These fourteen documentaries took him three years to complete in the most extraordinary places in the world: Easter Island, Chile; San Augustin, Bolivia; Nazca, Peru; Sahara, Libya; Petra, Jordan; and Giza, Egypt; all with the participation of the most prominent scientists in the world. This series twice put his life at risk but allowed him time for reflection and to meet some unforgettable people, especially Maria Reiche.
To regain his momentum he decided to move on to nature documentaries, especially those tied to the conservation of species, and then created "The Return of the Whales" and "The Marine Park of Fajal", in South Africa; "Wild Rescue" on cheetah conservation with Ann Van Dyke; in Florida "The Song of the Mermaids" on the manatee and "The Giant" on manta ray conservation; also "Monkey World" with Jim Cronin and his efforts to support a refuge for chimpanzees; in South Africa "Speaking with the Lions" with Brian Jones; in Italy "Saving the Marine Tortoises" with Flegra Bentinvegna and "Falcons" in Sicily on the problems tied to illegal hunting; in the Netherlands "Seals" filmed in the rehabilitation centre in Pieterburen with Lenie t' Hart and then, "The Last Rhinoceros" in Botswana about the last white rhinoceros in the world.
After these documentaries, he returned to social documentaries with two documentaries in Azerbaijan, "A Peace Too Far" and "A Case of Emergency", that after his experiences during the war in Armenia allowed him to discover the other side of the conflict, and extraordinarily to find Zachir from the "Prisoner in the Cellar."
Through his history in TV he successfully found the finances to create his first full-length feature film, titled "The Four Doors of the Desert", filmed mostly in the Sahara desert with an international cast including the acclaimed actress Aure Atika as a main character. The film revolves around the colonial dominance in North Africa and tells the story of two men (inspired by the life of Charles de Foucauld and Moussa Ag Amastan), a Christian and a Muslim in a colonial time at the beginning of the last century. Unfortunately the film was affected by the government of Berlusconi, who halted all the money for the independent distribution of cinema works, ultimately denying the film's release. After a long pause in his work, he created "Joe Petrosino", a documentary that tells the story of an Italian policeman who challenges the Mafia for the programme "La storia siamo noi" for Rai 2. Disappointed with the events regarding the film, he decided to move to England with his English-Italian family to work in a more stimulating environment.

Ed Gallagher (1958 – May 4, 2005) was an American football player who played for the University of Pittsburgh at offensive tackle from 1977 to 1979.
In 1985, Gallagher attempted to commit suicide due to depression as he struggled to come to terms with his homosexuality. The incident occurred twelve days after his first sexual encounter with another man. Gallagher survived the suicide attempt, but was left paraplegic. Gallagher later stated that before his attempt "he had become unable to reconcile his image of himself as an athlete with gay urges". However, he believed that the incident also helped him, stating "I was more emotionally paralyzed then, than I am physically now." He went on to become an author and speak out publicly about disabilities and homosexuality, including in an interview with CBC Radio's "The Inside Track" for "The Last Closet", a special episode about homophobia in sports which aired in 1993. He was also the founder of the organization Alive to Thrive.
Gallagher died of a heart condition in 2005 at his home in New Rochelle, New York.

Bayern (song)

"Bayern" ("Bavaria") is a punk hymn by Die Toten Hosen. It's the third single and the sixteenth track from the album "Unsterblich".
It is an anti-FC Bayern Munich song. A slogan from this song has become synonymous with DTH among the fans, which can be shortened: "Es kann soviel passieren. Es kann soviel geschehen/Nur eins weiß ich hundertprozentig. Nie im Leben würde ich zu Bayern gehen." ("Many things can happen. Many things can come to pass/One thing I know for sure. Never in my life would I go to Bayern." meaning the football club).
Also Real Madrid and Manchester United are mentioned along with Uli Hoeneß, the manager of FC Bayern.
The Tipp-Kick version is more anthem-like, as it features the line "Wir würden nie zum FC Bayern München gehen" ("We would never go to FC Bayern Munich") throughout the song, not only in the end and the emphasis is taken off the I-character (the narrator).
Music video.
The music video was directed by Peter Thorwarth. Most of it consists of a friendly football match, where various people (and a dog) take part of, including the band. After the match the band is shown playing at a gig. In the end, a figure in a Bayern jacket is seen (implied to be Uli Hoeneß, the club's president) watching the VHS of the music video, noting "Das ist der Dreck, an dem unsere Gesellschaft irgendwann ersticken wird." ("This is the kind of filth that will choke our society at some point."), an actual quote from Hoeneß about the song. On wishing Hoeneß a happy 60th birthday, Campino mentioned that Die Toten Hosen lost significant CD sales in the South of Germany since the release of the song, and that as of 2012, the sales had not recovered.

In 2007, federal offshore tracts produced 27% of the oil and 14% of the natural gas in the United States. Three of the top ten oil fields in the United States in terms of the proven remaining reserves were offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 (Mars-Ursa, Thunder Horse, and Atlantis). The oil production in the offshore area owned by the federal government reached in 2007, down from the record of produced in 2002. 2.86 TCF of offshore gas produced in 2007 was down from the high of 5.25 TCF produced in 1996.
Ownership of offshore oil and gas.
The issue of state versus federal ownership has a long and contentious history (see "Tidelands"). The US Supreme Court ruled in 1947 that the federal government owned all the seabed off the California coast; the court applied the same doctrine against Louisiana and Texas in 1950. The court ruling invalidated existing state leases over producing offshore oil fields in the three states. However, the US Congress passed the Submerged Land Act in 1953, which recognized state ownership of the seabed within of the shore. That same year Congress also passed the Outer Continental Shelf Act, which gave the federal government jurisdiction over minerals on and under the seabed farther offshore from state waters.
The first federal offshore lease sale was held in 1954, to offer oil production rights under federal seabed in offshore Louisiana.
State ownership.
Each coastal state owns the territory extending from the shore at mean low tide, and has jurisdiction to decide whether or not, and under what terms, to lease the territory for oil and gas. Exceptions include Texas and the west coast of Florida, which for historical reasons own the seabed out to from the shore. Louisiana is included in the 3 nautical mile rule, but because it had active offshore leases defined before 1950 (and before most other states), its territory is measured using the Admiralty Nautical Mile, while other states use the International Nautical Mile, adopted by the United States in 1954.
The exact definition of the shoreline, dividing state waters offshore and potential private land onshore, depends on state law. Shifting shorelines in the vicinity of oil fields have been a thorny issue. In the Goose Creek field along the coast in Harris County, Texas, so much oil was produced that the ground elevation sank ten or more feet, putting some privately owned oil-producing lands below sea level. The state of Texas then declared that the newly submerged land, along with its oil revenue, was state property.
Federal ownership.
Traditionally, nations owned the territory extending from shore. In 1945, President Harry Truman issued a proclamation extending US jurisdiction over mineral resources to the edge of the continental shelf; the proclamation was codified by Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953. The Geneva Convention on the continental shelf in 1958 recognized the right of each nation to the mineral resources on its adjacent continental shelf, out to a water depth of 200 m. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan issued a proclamation extending the US Exclusive Economic Zone to from the shore. 
By virtue of the Law of the Sea, which the US has signed but not ratified, each nation controls an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that extends from its shore. The EEZ confers exclusive rights to a nation to explore and produce minerals, including oil and gas. In areas within 200 nautical miles of two or more nations, the territorial line is drawn equidistant from the shores of the two nations. The US and Canada referred a dispute over the EEZ boundary in the Atlantic Ocean to the International Court of Justice, which decided the matter (see "Georges Bank"). Article 76 of the Law of the Sea provides that nations may under certain circumstances extend their EEZs beyond the 200 nautical mile limit, to up to from shore. 
The 200 nautical mile EEZ left a small area in the western Gulf of Mexico enclosed by the EEZs of the United States and Mexico, but outside the EEZ of either nation (the "doughnut hole"). The US and Mexico concluded a treaty to divide the area between them. A second, and as yet unresolved "doughnut hole" exists in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, bordered by the EEZs of the US, Mexico, and Cuba.
Leasing and drilling on federal offshore seabed is controlled by the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), previously named the US Minerals Management Service (MMS). The BOEMRE issues leases through competitive bidding by sealed bids. The oil and gas company offering the highest up-front payment to the government (called a "bonus") wins the lease. The government also receives a fixed annual "rental" based on the area for non-producing leases, and a percentage of the market value of any oil or gas produced and sold ("royalty"). The leases expire after a set number of years, or continue however long afterward that oil and gas are continually produced from the lease. Individual tracts are generally . Current leases being offered in the Gulf of Mexico have 5-year terms for tracts in water depths of less than 400 m, and 8 years for tracts in water greater than 400 m. Royalty rates are 18.75% regardless of water depth. From 1954 through 2004, the federal government received $64 billion in bonuses, $3 billion in rentals, $89 billion in royalties, and $3 billion in taken-in-kind oil deliveries in lieu of royalties.
International ownership.
Some potential petroleum deposits underlie areas outside the EEZ. For example, the North Chuckchi Basin in the Arctic Ocean is partly inside and partly outside the US EEZ.
Offshore drilling by area.
Historically, offshore drilling began by extending known coastal oil- and gas-producing trends out into the ocean. For this reason, most US offshore drilling has taken place offshore Louisiana, Texas, California, and Alaska, areas with coastal onshore oil and gas fields.
Alaska.
The first federal lease sale offshore Alaska was held in 1976. Alaska produces oil and gas from offshore areas in the Cook Inlet and the Arctic Ocean. Endicott Island is an artificial island built to produce oil from beneath the Beaufort Sea.
California.
See "Offshore oil and gas in California"
Offshore drilling began in California in 1896, when operators in the Summerland Oil Field in Santa Barbara County followed the field into the ocean by drilling from piers built out over the ocean. 
Leasing California state seabed is controlled by the State Lands Commission, which halted further leasing of state offshore tracts after the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969. In 1994 the California legislature codified the ban on new leases by passing the California Coastal Sanctuary Act, which prohibited new leasing of state offshore tracts. 
State offshore seabed in California produced of oil per day, and federal offshore tracts produced of oil per day in November 2008. State and federal offshore tracts together made up 16% of the state's oil production. Notable offshore fields include the Ellwood Oil Field, which is partially onshore and partially offshore, and the Dos Cuadras Field, source of the 1969 spill, which is entirely within the federal zone.
Gulf of Mexico.
See "Offshore oil and gas in the US Gulf of Mexico"
The western and central Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, is one of the major petroleum-producing areas of the United States. In 2007, federal leases in the western and central Gulf of Mexico produced 25% of the nation's oil and 14% of the nation's natural gas. In 2008, federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico produced of oil, down from in 2002; however, due to new deep-water discoveries, the MMS projects that oil production from the Gulf of Mexico will increase to per year by 2013. 
Major fields include Atlantis Oil Field, and the Tiber oilfield (discovered 2009) and others in the Keathley Canyon protraction area. Notable oil platforms include Baldpate, Bullwinkle, Mad Dog, Magnolia, Mars, Petronius, and Thunder Horse. Notable individual wells include Jack 2 and Knotty Head.
The eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Gulf Coast Florida, has never been a petroleum-producing area due to federal and state restrictions on exploration. Offshore platforms currently exist as far east as to near the Florida-Alabama border.
East Coast.
See "Offshore drilling on the US Atlantic coast"
In the late 1970s and early 1980s oil companies drilled 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. All the leases have now reverted to the government. A 1996 study by the MMS estimated undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources in Atlantic federal waters to be of oil and gas.
Pacific Northwest Coast.
In 1964, the federal government leased tracts totaling in offshore Oregon and Washington. Oil companies drilled six tests offshore Washington (three in state waters and three in federal waters) and seven tests in federal waters offshore Oregon. The OCS P-0130 well drilled offshore Oregon by Union Oil in 1966 was described as having "potential for commercial gas production", but none of the wells were completed as producers, and the federal leases expired in 1969.
Farther north, in Canadian waters, Shell Canada drilled 14 wells offshore from Vancouver Island from 1967-1969. None were successful. Canada has had a federal moratorium on offshore drilling on its west coast since 1972.
Great Lakes.
The lakebeds under the US portion of the Great Lakes are owned by the adjacent states. The only state that has allowed oil and gas drilling beneath the Great Lakes in recent years has been Michigan, and that only by directional drilling from onshore surface locations. All oil and gas drilling, either on or directionally beneath the Great Lakes, has been banned by federal law since 2002.
The Canadian side of Lake Erie has 480 producing gas wells in the lake. Gas production in Canadian Lake Erie waters dates back to 1913; more than 2000 wells have been drilled to the Clinton Sand, up to a few miles from the US side of the lake; the same formation produces gas from many onshore wells on the US side, but there are no wells in the US portion of the lake. The province of Ontario, where the offshore wells are located, allows gas wells, but not oil wells, in offshore Lake Erie. Ontario allows oil production from below the lake only from wells drilled directionally from onshore surface locations; a number of such directional wells are producing oil from beneath Lake Erie in the Goldsmith/Lakeshore Field.
A gas well to the Medina Group was drilled in 1958 in Pennsylvania state waters in Lake Erie. 
The only state that has current oil and gas production from beneath the Great Lakes is Michigan. Michigan has 13 oil and gas wells that produce from below Lake Michigan, all drilled directionally from surface locations on shore. Directional drilling beneath the Great Lakes is now banned.
The US Geological Survey has estimated that of recoverable petroleum liquids and of recoverable natural gas underlie the US portion of the Great Lakes. Petroleum potential was given to all of the lakes except Lake Superior. The majority of the natural gas (3.0 TCF) is thought to underlie Lake Erie.
Restrictions on offshore drilling.
See "US offshore drilling debate"
State restrictions.
A number of states, including California and Florida, have banned leasing of state waters for oil and gas drilling. In 2009 a bill that would have partially rescinded a ban on oil and gas leasing of Florida state waters failed in the Florida statehouse (see "Offshore oil and gas in Florida").
Federal restrictions.
Congress passed the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act in 1972, which provided for the establishment of National Marine Sanctuaries, in which certain activities, including oil and gas drilling, are prohibited. To date, 13 sanctuaries with a combined area of have been so designated.
In 1982, the US Congress directed that no federal funds be used to lease federal tracts off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, or central and northern California. Over the years Congress added other areas until the prohibited area included all the east and west coasts, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Congress repeated the effective ban on offshore drilling in these areas every year until September 2008, when an appropriations bill passed the House and Senate without the ban.
In 1990, Congress passed the North Carolina Outer Banks Protection Act, prohibiting leasing and drilling on federal seabed offshore from North Carolina.
In 1990, President George H. W. Bush issued an executive moratorium restricting federal offshore leasing to Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and parts of Alaska. The moratorium banned federal leasing through the year 2000 off the East Coast, West Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico (offshore Florida Gulf Coast), and the Northern Aleutian Basin of Alaska. In 1998, President Bill Clinton extended the moratorium through 2012. In July 2008, President George W. Bush rescinded the executive order.
In 2002, Congress imposed a moratorium on drilling on or directionally beneath the Great Lakes. The ban was made permanent by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
Part of the central and most of the eastern Gulf of Mexico was declared off-limits to oil and gas leasing until 2022 by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006.
Other mineral resources.
Offshore areas of the US may contain resources of sulfur, salt, sand and gravel, phosphate rock, manganese nodules, and heavy-mineral placer deposits. To date, none of these has been produced for commercial purposes except sulfur and salt, although the MMS has allowed sand dredging in federal waters to restore damaged beaches in Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, and Florida.
From 1960 to 2000, sulfur was mined by the Frasch process from the caprock of a salt dome at the Main Pass 299 mine, offshore Louisiana. A total of 34 million short tons of sulfur were recovered before the mine was closed; salt was also recovered.

Charles McBurney (surgeon)

Charles Heber McBurney, MD (17 February 1845, Roxbury, Massachusetts – 7 November 1913, Brookline, Massachusetts) was an American surgeon, well known for describing McBurney's point in appendicitis.
Biography.
Charles McBurney was born in 1845. He graduated in the arts from Harvard College in 1866, and qualified in medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in New York with an M.D. in 1870. He trained further in Europe for 2 years, and started practice in New York in 1873. He became assistant surgeon to the Bellevue Hospital in 1880, and surgeon-in-chief of the Roosevelt Hospital in 1888. Here he did his most famous work on appendicitis, presenting his report on operative management to the New York Surgical Society in 1889. He described the point of greatest tenderness in appendicitis, which is now known as McBurney's point. He was professor of surgery from 1889 to 1907, and thereafter became emeritus professor of surgery. He continued to advance the treatment of appendicitis, and in 1894 he described the incision that he used; although the incision had previously been described by Louis L. MacArthur, it became known as McBurney's incision. He was awarded an honorary fellowship by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1905 during the college's 400th year anniversary celebrations. The honorary fellowship was awarded to the 36 most well known surgeons of the time. 
In addition to his work on appendicitis, McBurney also published papers on the treatment of pyloric stenosis, management of shoulder dislocation with fracture of the humerus, and gallstone disease. He also introduced the use of rubber gloves during his operations to improve aseptic technique, following the lead of William Halsted.
He was a keen hunter and fisherman, and died in 1913 on a hunting trip in Massachusetts.
His grandson was American archaeologist Charles McBurney and his great-grandson is English actor, writer and director Simon McBurney.

A Ghost Story for Christmas

A Ghost Story for Christmas is a strand of annual British short television films originally broadcast on BBC One from 1971 to 1978, and later revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments are directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films are all shot on 16 mm colour film. The remit behind the series was to provide a television adaptation of a classic ghost story referencing the oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.
Each instalment is a separate adaptation of a short story, ranging from 30 to 50 minutes in duration and each featuring well-known British actors such as Clive Swift, Robert Hardy, Peter Vaughan, Edward Petherbridge and Denholm Elliott in the title roles. The first five are adaptations of ghost stories by M. R. James, the sixth is based on a short story by Charles Dickens and the two final instalments are original screenplays by Clive Exton and John Bowen respectively.
An earlier black-and-white 1968 "Omnibus" adaptation of M.R. James's "Whistle and I'll Come to You", directed by Jonathan Miller, is often cited as an influence upon the production of the films, and is sometimes included in the canon. The series was revived by BBC Four in 2005 with a new series of annual adaptations.
Production.
Background.
The first five films are adaptations of stories from the four books by M. R. James published between 1904 and 1925. The ghost stories of James, an English mediaeval scholar and provost of Eton College and King's College, Cambridge were originally narrated as Christmas entertainments for an audience of friends and selected students. The sixth film, "The Signalman", is an adaptation of an 1866 story by Charles Dickens published in his magazine "All the Year Round". In its original context, it was one of eight stories set around the fictional Mugby Junction and its branch lines. It was inspired by the Staplehurst rail crash in June 1865, of which Dickens had been a survivor, having attended to dying fellow passengers. He subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result of the accident. The final two stories are original screenplays: Clive Exton was an experienced television screenwriter and John Bowen was primarily known as a novelist and playwright.
Adaptation.
In a 1995 interview, Lawrence Gordon Clark stated that the stories "focus on suggestion. The aim, they say, is to chill rather than shock. Partly because television is not best suited to carrying off big-screen pyrotechnics, but mainly because they want to keep faith with the notion of a ghost story in its literary rather than cinematic tradition." Helen Wheatley notes that the best adaptations maintain the stories' "sense of decorum and restraint ... withholding the full revelation of the supernatural until the very last moment, and centring on the "suggestion" of a ghostly presence rather than the horror of visceral excess and abjection."
After the first two adaptations by Clark, the tales were adapted by a number of playwrights and screenwriters. In most instances, the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, "A Warning to the Curious" frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of James' original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition, the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young, fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure, to a more menacing middle-aged character, driven to find the treasure by poverty and in full awareness of what he is doing.
In "The Signalman", adaptor Andrew Davies adds scenes of the traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and re-affirms the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features with those of the spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.
Filming.
Lawrence Gordon Clark had made a name as a BBC documentary director during the 1960s, but "The Stalls of Barchester" was the first dramatic production he had directed. Clark recalls in an interview for the 2012 BFI DVD release that "the BBC at that time gave you the space to fail, and generously so too. They backed you up with marvellous technicians, art departments, film departments and so forth."
Unusually for a BBC television drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film. As a result of this, cameraman John McGlashan (who filmed all of the original adaptations) was able to make use of night shoots and dark, shadowy interiors, which would not have been possible with the then-standard video-based studio interiors. Of "The Stalls of Barchester" Clark recalls "Fox (Paul Fox, controller of BBC One) gave us a tiny budget...and we set out to do a full-blooded drama on location. Budgets were really tiny, and we shot for ten days and brought the film in for about £8000."
The filming of the separate adaptations took place at a variety of locations, although East Anglia, where M.R. James set many of his stories, was the location for early instalments. "The Stalls of Barchester" was filmed on location at Norwich Cathedral and the surrounding close. "A Warning to the Curious" was filmed around the North Norfolk coastline at Waxham, Happisburgh and Wells-next-the-Sea, although the original story was set in "Seaburgh" (a disguised version of Aldeburgh, Suffolk). Later locations include the Severn Valley Railway for "The Signalman" and Wells Cathedral for "The Treasure of Abbot Thomas".
Episode list.
With the exception of the final film, the tales were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and produced by Rosemary Hill. The final 1978 episode was directed by Derek Lister, after which the series was discontinued.
Revival.
BBC Four revisited the series at Christmas 2004, and in 2005 began to produce new adaptations of M. R. James stories, broadcast along with repeats of episodes from the original 1970s series. BBC Two premiered a new adaptation by Neil Cross of M.R. James' "Oh, Whistle and I'll come to You, My Lad" on Christmas Eve 2010. Mark Gatiss's adaptation of "The Tractate Middoth" was broadcast on BBC Two on Christmas Day 2013, the first time the title "A Ghost Story for Christmas" was explicitly shown on screen. This was followed by a documentary "M.R. James: Ghost Writer" about the author's life and the films his work inspired.
Critical reception.
Critical reception differs between the films, but several, such as "The Signalman" are regarded as classic television ghost stories. Sarah Dempster, writing in "The Guardian" in 2005 noted that "Perhaps the most surprising aspect ... is how little its adaptations ... have dated. They may boast the odd signifier of cheap 1970s telly — outlandish regional vowels, inappropriate eyeliner, a surfeit of depressed oboes — but lurking within their hushed cloisters and glum expanses of deserted coastland is a timelessness at odds with virtually everything written, or broadcast, before or since.
The production values have received particular praise. Helen Wheatley writes that, "the series was shot on film on location, with much attention paid to the minutiae of period detail; as such it might be seen to visually prefigure the filmic stylishness and traditions of later literary adaptations such as "Brideshead Revisited" and "The Jewel in the Crown"." However, she notes that unlike those adaptations, the sinister tone of the period pieces could lend itself the label of a "feel bad" heritage television drama.
"The Signalman" is perhaps the most critically acclaimed. Simon Farquhar suggests that the film is the first evidence of Andrew Davies' gift as an adaptor of literary fiction: "despite an extremely arduous shoot, Davies and Clarke's fog-wreathed, flame-crackling masterpiece manages something the production team could never have imagined: it's better than the book." Dave Rolinson notes that while "the adaptation inevitably misses Dickens' nuanced and often unsettling prose ... it achieves comparably skilful effects through visual language and sound, heightening theme and supernatural mood ... The production heightens the story's crucial features of repetition and foreshadowing."
Sergio Angelini writes about "A Warning to the Curious": "Of Clark's many adaptations of James' stories, this is perhaps the most varied in its use of landscape and the most visually arresting in its attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere ... Using long lenses to flatten the scenery and make the ghost indistinct in the background, John McGlashan's fine cinematography brilliantly conveys the ageless, ritualistic determinism of Ager's pursuit and signposts the inevitability of Paxton's demise." He is less appreciative of "The Ash Tree", noting that the literal adaptation of the story's ending loses the atmosphere of earlier instalments: "While the creatures are certainly grotesque and threatening, compared with some of the other adaptations of the series, "The Ash Tree" does lose some power through this lack of ambiguity. The result overall remains satisfyingly unsettling, however, thanks also to Petherbridge's restrained, psychologically acute performance.
The adaptations have been an influence on the work of writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss recalled that "Lost Hearts" is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child. He also noted, "I absolutely love "The Treasure of Abbot Thomas". The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, "It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...". There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back. The doctor is heading up the drive, and he can't quite see him in the sunlight. Then it pauses to that amazing crane shot ... Very spooky.
The reception of the two later instalments, "Stigma" and "The Ice House", was decidedly critical, with most reviewers noting that switching to original stories instead of adaptations was "misjudged". David Kerekes writes that "The Ice House" is almost "totally forgotten". Wheatley has commented that they heralded a divergence from the stage-inspired horror of the 1940s and 1950s to a more modern Gothic horror based in the present day, losing in the process the "aesthetic of restraint" evident in the original adaptations.
The BBC Four revival beginning in 2005 with "A View from a Hill" was greeted warmly by Sarah Dempster, who noted that the programme was, "in every respect, a vintage "Ghost Story for Christmas" production. There are the powdery academics hamstrung by extreme social awkwardness. There is the bumbling protagonist bemused by a particular aspect of modern life. There are stunning, panoramic shots of a specific area of the British landscape (here, a heavily autumnal Suffolk). There is the determined lack of celebrity pizzazz. There is tweed. And there is, crucially, a single moment of heart-stopping, corner-of-the-eye horror that suggests life, for one powdery academic at least, will never be the same again."
Related works.
Clark directed another M. R. James story "Casting The Runes" for Yorkshire Television's "Playhouse", first broadcast on ITV on 24 April 1979. Adapted by Clive Exton, it re-imagined the events of James' story taking place in a contemporary television studio. Meanwhile, for Christmas 1979 the BBC produced a 70-minute-long adaptation of Sheridan Le Fanu's gothic tale "Schalcken The Painter" directed and adapted by Leslie Megahey. Like the earlier "Whistle and I'll Come to You", the production was listed as part of the long-running BBC arts strand "Omnibus". Before Clark's films came under the remit of the BBC Drama department, they had commissioned a Christmas play from Nigel Kneale for which the writer penned an original ghost story, "The Stone Tape", broadcast on Christmas Day 1972. With its modern setting, this is not considered part of the "Ghost Story for Christmas" strand and was originally intended as an episode of the anthology "Dead of Night".
Repeats of the original series on BBC Four at Christmas 2007 included "The Haunted Airman", a new adaptation of Dennis Wheatley's novel "The Haunting of Toby Jugg" by Chris Durlacher, although this film was originally screened on 31 October 2006. For Christmas 2008, an original three-part ghost story by Mark Gatiss entitled "Crooked House" was produced instead, with the writer citing the original 1970s adaptations as a key influence. A different James's ghost story was broadcast by the BBC for 2009; Henry James's 1898 novella "The Turn of the Screw" was adapted as a feature-length drama by Sandy Welch and broadcast on BBC One on 30 December. 
Release.
The BFI released the complete set of "Ghost Story for Christmas" films plus related works such as both versions of "Whistle and I'll Come to You" on Region 2 DVD in 2012, in five volumes as well as a box set, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of M.R.

Scale the Summit

Scale the Summit is an American instrumental / progressive metal band based out of Houston, Texas. It formed in 2004 and signed to Prosthetic Records.
The band draws influences from other progressive acts such as Cynic and Dream Theater. However, unlike most other progressive metal bands, they have no vocalist and play instrumental music. The band gained notice as part of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour with Dream Theater, Zappa Plays Zappa and Bigelf.
History.
Formation and early years.
Chris Letchford and Travis Levrier grew up in the same neighborhood, but never played music together until 2004, after they reconnected a few years earlier in a record store discussing a common interest, Between the Buried and Me. The duo formed a metal band in Houston that had trouble finding a bass guitarist and drummer. Letchford was set to attend the Los Angeles Musicians Institute a year after the band's formation, and Levrier decided to attend as well. The duo mainly hoped to meet new people to join their band, reasoning that their chances of doing so would be highest there, and after only a few months they met Jordan Eberhardt and Pat Skeffington, who joined on bass guitar and drums respectively. They first noticed Skeffington when they saw him wearing a Between the Buried and Me T-shirt with drumsticks protruding from his backpack, and Eberhardt joined in response to an ad the trio placed on Myspace. Reflecting on the experience, Letchford explained, "I still think to this day that it was just meant to be, as moving out to Los Angeles didn't guarantee anything. I think we all just crossed paths at the perfect time."
Although the band played typical technical metal with a vocalist in Houston, Letchford and Levrier noted a change in their sound when they started writing again in Los Angeles. After writing their first song, "Rode In on Horseback", the duo realized the material sounded as if it was already complete, without being written for a singer, and so the duo dismissed the idea of finding another singer. The duo took two years of classes at the Institute, where their new band recorded four songs on a demo and played shows around the town. To make it easier to pursue a career in the band, Letchford and Levrier convinced Eberhardt and Skeffington, whom they had never met before attending school, to move to Houston with them instead of basing the band in Los Angeles. Letchford later explained that despite enjoying the area's natural beauty he felt the music scene in Los Angeles was too crowded and difficult to survive in. The band's formation was temporarily threatened by Levrier finding work for a band called Into the Moat, which he considered joining permanently, but Letchford sent him a demo recording of the song "Omni" (a song that would appear on the band's debut album, "Monument"), and Levrier changed his mind. Into the Moat disbanded in spite of touring with acts such as Between the Buried and Me and The Black Dahlia Murder. Levrier coined the name "Scale the Summit" when he perused a photography book and saw a picture titled "The Summit", and mentioned the name as soon as it came to mind; the group took the name immediately.
Early releases.
Scale the Summit's first release was a demo that they personally handed-out at shows in limited quantities, and their first album, "Monument", was self-funded and self-released. Letchford was dismissive of the album's sound, which he considered inferior to those of the group's later albums as the group had had little experience in songwriting by that time and limited funds for the sessions. In 2009 they signed with Prosthetic Records and began working on their second album, "Carving Desert Canyons". Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater heard the band's music and invited them to tour with Dream Theater on the 2009 ProgNation Tour.
In 2010, they toured North America in support of Between the Buried and Me, and recorded their third album, "The Collective", which they released the following year. Also in 2011, the band toured with Periphery and Fair to Midland, The Human Abstract, Cynic, 3, Protest The Hero, Last Chance To Reason, Volumes, Structures, Rings of Saturn, and The Contortionist.
In April 2012, Jordan Eberhardt left the band, citing his reluctance to continue touring full-time; he was replaced by Mark Michell.
In November 2012, Letchford announced that the band had started writing material for their next album, "The Migration", which was released on June 11 the following year.
Musical style.
Scale the Summit maintain a professional standard of musicianship. Each member thoroughly rehearses his part of each song before the band enter the studio to record an album so they can record it immediately, and during each live performance they play every song exactly as it was recorded. Letchford estimates that most of the material remains the same between pre-recording rehearsals and during recording, even though the group do make alterations to the songs as they go sometimes.
The band refer to their style of music "adventure metal", a term which Letchford states originated from how listeners on the Musician's Institute campus told him and Levrier that they felt the music was taking them on a journey as they listened to it. Until their first album was released, the band were often told to get a vocalist and that they would not survive without one, but Letchford has admitted that even if there were auditioning vocalists who had exceptional talent, he and his bandmates were set against the idea of having a vocalist to the point that all prospective members for the position would be turned down. Lacking a vocalist enables the band to transcend the verse-chorus-verse songwriting strategy that most bands with singers have to use to accommodate the lyrics, but Letchford feels that writing music to be complete without vocals is more difficult. Without ruling-out the possibility of side projects that have vocalists, Letchford has stated that Scale the Summit's own music will never feature such things as guest vocals.
Mark Michell's recorded debut with the band was "The Migration". Michell has a substantial understanding of music theory, in much the same way as departing bassist Jordan Eberhardt, and he also has perfect pitch, according to Letchford. The other band members pursued music majors in college.
Song titles are usually selected after the songs are recorded; the band listen to the finished recording to see what kind of ideas it brings to mind, and name the song accordingly. The process for song title selection can last a long time, as the group strive to ensure that each song is named appropriately.

St Cross Church, Oxford

St Cross Church is a former church, now a historic collections centre, in Oxford, England, to the northeast of the centre of the city. The church is on St Cross Road just south of Holywell Manor. Also close by is Holywell Cemetery.
Church history.
St Cross Church was once a dependent chapelry of St Peter-in-the-East on Queen's Lane, north of the High Street in central Oxford. The precise date of the church's foundation is not known, but it has been suggested that the St Cross was first built around AD 890 by St Grimwald.
The chancel is 11th or 12th century and the nave was built in about 1160. The tower and aisles were added in the 13th century, the upper stage of the tower was rebuilt in 1464 and the north arcade and aisle were rebuilt in the middle of the 15th century. A few of the windows are original Perpendicular Gothic; the remainder are Victorian Gothic Revival.
The aisles were rebuilt again in the 19th century — the north (except for its west end) in 1839 and the south in 1843 — the latter to designs by the architect JM Derick. In 1876 the north aisle was extended by the addition of an organ chamber and vestry designed by HJ Tollit. In 1893 the church was restored under the direction of EP Warren, including the addition of new clerestory windows. The tower was repaired in 1908.
GE Street designed the west window of the north aisle, which was made in 1855. However, since then the window has been moved and, in Sir Nikolaus Pevsner's opinion, "garbled". Hardman & Co. made the east window of the chancel in 1874. St Cross church is a Grade I listed building.
In recent years services were held once weekly until 12 October 2008, when the church was closed.
Holywell Cemetery is behind the church and includes the graves of many notable people. They include the composer Sir John Stainer (1840–1901) who, while he was Professor of Music at Magdalen College, was church warden at St Cross. The clockmaker John Knibb (1650–1722), who was Mayor of Oxford in 1698 and 1710, is buried at St Cross with his widow and four of their daughters. Sir John Snell, founder of the Snell Exhibition, is also buried at St Cross Church.
Historic Collections Centre.
After the closure of the church in 2008, building work was undertaken to convert the building for use as an Historic Collections Centre for Balliol College. The College has a 999 year lease on the building, under which the chancel will be maintained for occasional services. The various fittings and fixtures of the church have been removed including the organ which has been relocated to a church in Ireland. The bells remain "in situ", but unringable, after Oxford City Council refused permission for their removal. The work was completed at an estimated cost of £3.3 million and opened in 2011.

<doc id="21455306" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21455306" title="Xanthoria elegans">
Xanthoria elegans

Xanthoria elegans, commonly known as the elegant sunburst lichen, is a lichenized species of fungus in the genus "Xanthoria", family Teloschistaceae. Recognized by its bright orange or red pigmentation, this species grows on rocks, often near bird or rodent perches. It has a circumpolar and alpine distribution. It was one of the first lichens to be used for the rock-face dating method known as lichenometry.
Taxonomy.
"Xanthoria elegans" was described by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link as "Lichen elegans" in 1791, and transferred to the genus "Xanthoria" by Theodor Magnus Fries (son of Elias Magnus Fries) in 1860.
Description.
The thallus of this lichen is described as foliose, having the aspect of leaves, although the central portions of the thallus may appear nearly crustose. It is small, typically less than wide, with lobes less than broad, appressed to loosely appressed. The upper surface is some shade of orange while the lower surface is white, corticate, with short, sparse hapters (an attachment structure produced by some lichens). The vegetative propagules called soredia and isidia are absent, although apothecia are common. It has been described as possessing swollen, orange-yellow thalli (in streams), compact orange thalli (on boulders) or dark orange-red thalli on the driest rock faces.
The variety "X. elegans" var. "granulifera", characterized by having isidia-like vegetative propagules, has been reported from Greenland and Spitsbergen.
Growth rate.
"Xanthoria elegans" was one of the first species used for lichenometry, a technique of estimating the age of rock faces by measuring the diameter of the lichen thalli growing on them. After an initial period of one or two decades to establish growth (the ecesis interval), "X. elegans" grows at a rate of 0.5 mm per year for the first century, before slowing down somewhat.
Habitat and distribution.
This species grows on rock, both calcareous and siliceous, occasionally overgrowing moss or litter or rock. It is often found on exposed to somewhat sheltered sites, often near bird or small-mammal droppings. It has also adapted successfully to growth on man-made and natural growing surfaces from the sea-water spray zone to the boreal forest and in the grasslands of the continental interior. It can thrive in areas having less than annual precipitation and can survive submerged in streams for much of the growing season.
"Xanthoria elegans" has an extremely broad circumpolar and alpine distribution, and is found on all continents except Australia. It is widespread in Antarctic regions.
The lichen is used as a model system to study the potential to resist extreme environments of outer space. Out of various lichens tested, it showed the ability to recover from space-simulating situations, including exposure to 16 hours of vacuum at 10−3 Pa and UV radiation at wavelengths less than 160 nm or greater than 400 nm. "X. elegans" has survived an 18 month exposure to solar UV radiation, cosmic rays, vacuum and varying temperatures in an experiment performed by the ESA outside of the ISS.
Bioactive compounds.
Various anthraquinone compounds have been identified in "X. elegans", including allacinal, physcion, teloschistin, xanthorin, and erythoglaucin, murolic acid and a glycoside derivative of murolic acid ((18"R")-18-"O"-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-2)-β-D-glucopyranoside).
Carotenoids.
Carotenoids have a number of physiological functions in lichens, such as enhancing the availability of light energy for photosynthesis, and protecting the organism from the photooxidizing action of UV light. In "X. elegans", like many "Xanthoria" species, specimens growing in areas with intense UV radiation contain more carotenoids than those grown in more shaded areas. The biosynthesis of carotenoids is also dependent on the season of the year, as was shown in a study of "X. elegans" in Antarctica. The predominant carotenoid in "X. elegans", responsible for the orange-yellow color, is mutatoxanthin.
Bioactive compounds.
In a screen of lichen extracts for cancer-preventing effects, the extract of "X. elegans" showed significant ability to enhance the activity of , an enzyme that breaks down certain potential carcinogens, rendering them less harmful.

Youngstown Belt Railroad

The Youngstown Belt Railroad is a part of the Ohio Central Railroad System, which was bought by Genesee & Wyoming Inc. in 2008, serving the area northwest of Youngstown, Ohio. It began operations in 1997, mainly on ex-Erie Railroad trackage owned by the affiliated Warren and Trumbull Railroad (W&T), which acquired the "Lordstown Cluster" from Conrail in 1996. It also leases a short ex-Baltimore and Ohio Railroad segment from CSX Transportation, formerly operated by the W&T.
The company operates in three separate areas near Warren, Niles, and Youngstown, connected by trackage rights over the Norfolk Southern Railway. In addition to its connections with affiliated railroads - the Warren and Trumbull Railroad at Warren and the Mahoning Valley Railway and Youngstown and Austintown Railroad at Youngstown - it interchanges in Youngstown with the Norfolk Southern at Haselton Yard and with CSX.
History.
The YB's trackage near Youngstown and Niles includes pieces of a former main line, completed in 1856 by the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad, a predecessor of the Erie Railroad. Other ex-Erie trackage includes two branches to Leadville (connecting with the Youngstown and Austintown Railroad there) and the U.S. Steel Ohio Works, and the portion of the line at Warren north of the Warren and Trumbull Railroad junction (opened by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad as part of a main line to Dayton in 1863). The remainder of the Warren line was opened in 1873 by the Ashtabula, Youngstown and Pittsburgh Railroad, a Pennsylvania Railroad predecessor. Conrail sold all of these lines to the Warren and Trumbull Railroad in 1996, and later that year the W&T leased a connecting ex-Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line near Youngstown from CSX Transportation. Effective January 1, 1997, the Youngstown Belt Railroad began operating this trackage under lease.

Quotes.
"The Resurrection of Christ is the most significant event to take place in History. It is the event that differentiates Christianity from every other religion. Other religions have mortal leaders, whereas the Head of the Church is the Resurrected Christ. “Resurrection of Christ” implies the deification and the resurrection of human nature, and the hope for deification and resurrection of our own hypostasis. Since the medicine has been discovered, there is hope for life. 
Through Christ’s Resurrection, both life and death take on a new meaning. “Life” now means communion with God; “Death” is no longer the end of this present lifetime, but the distancing of Man from Christ. The separation of the soul from the mortal body is no longer seen as “death”; it is only a temporary slumber." 
From: "The Resurrection of Christ is the Annihilation of Death" 
"Orthodoxy does not wish to be a religious community for charitable services, nor a human organization which strives only for peace on earth and coexistence among nations. Orthodoxy wishes to be, above all, Body of Christ, a salvation laboratory for healing human existence, which is basic prerequisite for man's formation at the limits of authentic communion with God and the world. 
Moreover, there is no evolutionary process in Orthodoxy by the meaning of continuous change. Our course is Christ-centered with no changes. Christ remains the absolute center and reference point of Orthodox people in all times. He secures our unity throughout time, with His presence within ourselves. His uncreated action is uniting (in the horizontal, as well as vertical dimension) the faithful people throughout history and accomplishes their unity, not as subjection under fixed norms of living and acting, but as life resulting by His presence within themselves." 
From: "Orthodox Spirituality - Mutual Concession of Present and Future Life"

Domingo Monterrosa

Lieutenant Colonel Domingo Monterrosa Barrios was a military commander of the Armed Forces of El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War.
Monterrosa distinguished himself preceding his 1963 graduation from the Escuela Militar Capitán General Gerardo Barrios military academy. Monterrosa went on to take military classes from American soldiers in Panama, and later on went to Taiwan to study anti-communist insurgency tactics. Soon after his return to El Salvador, Monterrosa was assigned to become the leader of the elite and controversial Atlacatl Battalion. The Atlacatl Battalion was held responsible for the El Mozote Massacre. Monterrosa was seen by local guide (most likely someone that had never seen Monterrosa) landing from his helicopter prior to the start of the massacre, as told by reporter Mark Danner; however, Danner also reported that Monterrosa had been contacted by a U.S. military advisor (a more legitimate source) to share the outcome of the battle that had taken place in the Mozote. At that point, Monterrosa was in the Atlacatl's headquarters. According to Danner's story, after the conversation with the U.S. advisor, Monterrosa boarded a helicopter and headed to Morazan. "The Washington Post" reported in 2007 that Monterrosa had ordered the massacre. The Mozote was a tiny village located North of Morazan. It was a launching pad for guerrilla operations in the area. The villagers were open supporters of the FMLN according to an investigation conducted by a staff from the State Department in early 1982. Francisco Mena Sandoval, a traitor of El Salvador's military and a leader of the terrorist organization, Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP), indicated in his book "Del Ejercito Nacional al Ejercito Guerrillero" that in April 1982, he and other leaders of the ERP created a training camp for guerrillas in the Mozote.
Monterrosa was known to be obsessed with destroying the pro-rebel Radio Venceremos, which "specialized in ideological propaganda, acerbic commentary, and pointed ridicule of the government". Monterrosa was a supporter of President José Napoleón Duarte's efforts to hold peace talks in 1984, and his death seriously weakened them.
There are several versions on how Monterrosa was killed. One is that a malfunctioning helicopter crashed and killed its occupants including Col. Monterrosa. Another version is that envious military leaders knowing the capacity and military ability of this leader sought to end his reputation and life because they feared that this man would end the war, and so curtail their roles as saviors of El Salvador which at the time was receiving substantial economic aid that most of the time, ended in their pockets. Another version states that an FMLN booby trap was set under a fake rebel radio transmitter that Monterrosa took with him as a victory trophy, in 1984. The bomb went off while he was in flight. Remnants of his helicopter can be found in the Museum of the Revolution in Perquin, Morazan department.
The museum of El Salvador's Armed Forces has designated a special section for Monterrosa. After his death in October 1984, the Salvadoran congress honored Monterrosa with the title of "Heroe de Joateca" and declared him a national hero for his service to the country.

2009 Manaus Aerotáxi crash

The Manaus Aerotáxi crash occurred in the state of Amazonas in Brazil on February 7, 2009. At 13:50 local time, a Manaus Aerotáxi Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante twin turboprop, registration PT-SEA, operating as an air taxi flight from Coari (SWKO) to Manaus (SBEG), crashed into the Manacapuru River about southwest of its destination, killing the two crew and 22 of the 26 passengers on board. The four surviving passengers, who were seated in the rear, managed to escape the sinking plane and swim safely to shore. Among the passengers were eight small children of whom one survived, and a family of 17, two of whom survived.
Crash.
The Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante twin turboprop aircraft, registration PT-SEA and serial number 110352, was carrying twenty-eight people, though it was certificated for twenty-one. Shortly before the crash, the pilot reportedly attempted to turn back to Coari due to heavy rainfall, but then had to make an emergency landing in the Manacapuru River, a tributary of the Amazon located between Santo Antonio and Montecristo. Survivors said they saw one of the airplane's propellers stop rotating before the crash.
The plane plunged into the river at a point about 500 meters from an abandoned runway, and 20 minutes away from its intended destination Manaus, and it submerged to a depth of about five to seven meters. The four survivors (three adults and one nine-year-old child), who were sitting at the rear of the plane, managed to open an emergency exit and reach the surface; they did not suffer major injuries.
Nearly forty rescue workers, including nine scuba divers and civil defense officials, spent the night searching through the jungle for survivors. Rescue crews were able to recover all twenty-four bodies; all deaths were attributed to drowning. The victims were fifteen adult passengers, seven children, and the two crew members.
The newspaper "Folha de S. Paulo" reported that the plane was packed with members of one family on their way to Manaus to celebrate the birthday of a relative. Fifteen of the fatal victims and two survivors belonged to this family. Paulo Roberto Pereira, a spokesman for the charter company involved, initially misreported the number of people on board, saying that there had been twenty-two passengers and two crew members aboard but later increased that figure to twenty-six passengers and two crew members. He later confirmed the involvement of eight small children.
Investigation.
Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) investigated the crash, and issued its final report on July 30, 2010. CENIPA concluded that the twin engine turboprop aircraft took off overweight, and its left engine failed while en route. Unable to maintain level flight on a single engine in its overweight condition, the aircraft crashed while attempting to execute an emergency landing.
According to CENIPA, the aircraft departed Coari weighing 549.7 kg above its maximum certificated takeoff weight, with 28 persons on board, including two crew and 26 passengers, while the aircraft was certificated for a maximum of two crew and 19 passengers. There were only 18 passenger seats installed in the aircraft, so eight passengers traveled as "lap children", a situation CENIPA called "inconsistent with reality" ("situação que não condizia com a realidade"). CENIPA noted that when the pilot in command contacted Amazonic Center air traffic control by radio, he reported 20 persons on board, instead of the actual 28.

Welcome to Macintosh (film)

Welcome to Macintosh is a 2008 documentary film focusing on computer company Apple Inc. and its Macintosh line of computers. The title comes from the original welcome message shown during the start-up of Macintosh computers.
Plot.
The film focuses on the history of computer company Apple Inc., and its Macintosh line of computers specifically. It discusses the company's employees, philosophy, practices, and interviews people who were working at Apple when the Macintosh was first released.
Production.
Ars Technica noted that neither Steve Jobs nor Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple Inc., appear in the film. However, several notable figures in the history of the Macintosh appear in the film, including Mac engineers Andy Hertzfeld and Jim Reekes, former Apple Evangelist Guy Kawasaki, and Ron Wayne, a "short-lived but original co-founder of Apple Computer".
Release.
"Welcome to Macintosh" was shown at five film festivals. The film's studio released a trailer on YouTube on November 29, 2008. The movie was released on DVD on December 15, 2008, and includes three hours of extra and deleted scenes. In early 2009, the studio setup group screenings for the film with seven Mac and Apple user groups in seven American cities (Rockville, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Scottsdale, Arizona; Nashville, Tennessee; Washington, D.C.; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Providence, Rhode Island), which include more than 700 people who signed up to attend the events.
Technology website Ars Technica describes "Welcome to Macintosh" as a film that "mixes history, criticism and an unapologetic revelry of all things Apple", and wrote, "If you liked "Pirates of Silicon Valley" or read "Revolution in the Valley", then this film is for you." After watching the film, Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak was pleased with the results, and appreciated how "unbelievable" it was to see people "say that great of things about ". He also noted that the film was "so on the mark", and that it was the best independent film regarding Apple that he has seen.

Paranormal operator

In mathematics, especially operator theory, a paranormal operator is a generalization of a normal operator. More precisely, a bounded linear operator "T" on a complex Hilbert space "H" is said to be paranormal if:
for every unit vector "x" in "H".
The class of paranormal operators was introduced by V. Istratescu in 1960s, though the term "paranormal" is probably due to Furuta.
Every hyponormal operator (in particular, a subnormal operator, a quasinormal operator and a normal operator) is paranormal. If "T" is a paranormal, then "T""n" is paranormal. On the other hand, Halmos gave an example of a hyponormal operator "T" such that "T"2 isn't hyponormal. Consequently, not every paranormal operator is hyponormal.
A compact paranormal operator is normal.

HouseholdHacker

HouseholdHacker is a YouTube channel and website that posts videos of various "hacks", or quick solutions, to common everyday problems. As of June 2010, the channel was the third most subscribed "guru" channel on YouTube, and the 35th most subscribed overall. The group is primarily known for its 2007 hoax video which claimed one could charge an iPod battery using an onion and Gatorade. The video fooled normally reliable sources, and drew the attention of the Myth Busters among others. A couple of additional hoax videos followed, but drew less attention. More recently, HouseholdHacker has aimed to publish more truthful content.
HouseholdHacker manages to draw an undisclosed significant revenue through their YouTube activities, and is one of the more significant partners of Google and YouTube. It is organized as "HouseHold Hacker LLC".
HouseholdHacker is also branching out, one of the offshoots being HouseHold Gamer.
Background.
The HouseholdHacker YouTube channel is dedicated to making "videos about everything geek". The videos, which are cross-posted at householdhacker.com, are the work of two anonymous editors known as "Traveler and Frosty Brain" or "Spencer and Dylan" who reside in San Jose, California and Peachtree City, Georgia. Justin Matthew the channels business manager for over 2 years makes over 30 appearances and also negotiated deals with Revision 3 and Break Media. He played a role into developing the hit show Scientific Tuesdays. Each video features a simple hack, or "a quick and/or clever creation for a method of solving of a problem." HouseholdHacker makes money by offering subscription downloads and T-shirts, but the duo told the LATimes that they do not make enough money to "live off comfortably at this point."
HouseholdHacker was launched in November 2007 and quickly attracted interest, becoming YouTube's most subscribed channel for the month of December 2007. By January 2009, HouseholdHacker was the 22nd most subscribed YouTube channel. The channel's popularity began to wane and by July they had fallen to 27th place overall. As of July 2009, HouseholdHacker is the third most subscribed "guru" channel on YouTube.
In 2013 HouseholdHacker has trended into a series of "Life Hack Videos" that illustrate simple and often reliable techniques to tackle situations commonly needing attention all around the house, with just the aid of readily available household items. Portland, Oregon is the new center point of production from filming to editing and collaborations with other YouTube personalities and channels becoming more prevalent. Major U.S. and international corporate entities are regular sponsors of the content produced, but in often subtle ways. HouseHoldHacker passed 2 Million subscribers in October 2013 and is consistently ranked in the top 200 by subscriber count on YouTube. Science, Pranks and other more obscure topics are often visited by the producer.
iPod Onion.
In November 2007, HouseholdHacker released a video entitled "How to Charge an iPod using electrolytes and an onion." The video, which claimed to demonstrate how one could recharge an iPod using little more than Gatorade and a white onion, was an overnight success. The video drew the attention of the Unofficial Apple Weblog, which reported it as fact, and hundreds of other blogs. Within its first week, the video had been viewed over 4 million times.
By the following November, the video had been viewed more than 7 million times and attracted the attention of ABCNews.com, who asked "Can an Onion Charge an iPod?" ABC put the video to the test, but failed to obtain the promised result. Reporter Emily Friedman remarked "this appears to be an iFraud."
The TV show MythBusters also put the onion video to the test in 2008. In a segment dubbed "iOnion", Grant Imahara was unable to get any charge from the onion setup found in the HouseholdHacker video. He explained that the setup lacked the crucial anode and cathode that would be required to get the electrolytes found in Gatorade moving and concluded the video was a complete hoax. In an interview with ABCNews, Adam Savage called the video "complete horseshit."
Appeal.
The iPod onion video fooled a number of normally savvy folks, or at least had them trying the technique out for themselves, which has led to several theories as to why it was so appealing. Farhad Manjoo of Salon.com speculates that it is the style in which the video was delivered. "He's got a friendly, helpful voice, but he's not casual – he speaks in the formal, confident manner of a TV how-to guy," says Manjoo. Anna Solana of La Vanguardia, on the other hand, speculated that it was the "science" itself that attracted the viewers, remarking that something so magical "freaks" people out and makes them want to believe.
Follow up videos.
Following the iPod onion success, HouseholdHacker has released a number of videos that have generated some attention, but none that have risen to the level of the iPod onion. A March 2008 video entitled "How to Cheat on any Test" has attracted 4 million views and the ire of some school teachers. Another video entitled "How to Create a High-Def speaker for under a buck" again drew the attention of the show "MythBusters". Tory Belleci followed the instructions in the video, but when it came time to plug in the speakers nothing happened. In addition to disproving the video, he pointed out that the "under a buck" part of the claim was also false, noting that a single minijack alone typically costs about $10 retail. However, it is possible to get minijack cables for under a dollar online. Another one of HouseholdHacker's hoaxes was "How to make hover shoes" which attracted 15 million views.
In addition to high profile hoaxes, the HouseholdHacker channel hosts a number of less provocative videos such as "How to Prank your Roommate on April Fools" and "How to make a secret, disguised safe." More recently, the channel has focused on more truthful content with its "Scientific Tuesdays" series, and has made fun of itself for previous hoaxes.

St. Michael the Archangel Church (Cincinnati, Ohio)

St. Michael the Archangel Church is a Roman Catholic church located at 2110 St. Michael Street, in Cincinnati, Ohio. The cornerstone of this church was laid in 1847 and the church dedicated a year later. The church closed April 5, 1998.
Parish formation.
As the tide of German immigrants continued to rise in Cincinnati, more churches were needed. Holy Trinity Church was the first German speaking parish. As the city grew in three directions; north, east and west; there were three parishes which descended from that parish Old St. Mary's Church, St. Philomena's Church and St. Joseph's Church. The three parishes were founded in 1840, 1846 and 1846 respectively. As more immigration followed, St. Michael's was founded, the first filial parish of St. Joseph.
The parish was located to what was then called Storrs township. Forty-five persons organized themselves into a congregation in the early part of 1847 and drew up a constitution for the church
A lot was donated by Innocent Troenle and two additional adjacent pieces of property were bought in April and May 1847. The cornerstone was laid August 1, 1847 and the church dedicated June 4, 1848. Rev. Fr. Zoppoth was selected as the first pastor for the congregation.
Filial parish and operation by the Combonis.
In 1868 St. Michael Church became the mother parish to St. Lawrence Church which was organized that same year. The Comboni Missionaries took charge of the parish in 1964. By this time many of the German-speaking families in the parish had begun to move to other parts of the city.
Parish closing.
In a mass celebrated by Daniel Edward Pilarczyk the church building was used for the final time to celebrate the Eucharist on April 5, 1998. The parish closed. The last pastor was Rev. Fr. Mark Burger.
Building and church today.
The Hook and Hastings pipe organ was removed and installed at West Chester's St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in September 1999 and dedicated on October 17, 1999. The sanctuary stands in the Lower Price Hill neighborhood. The entire complex is owned by the Lower Price Hill Community School, a non-profit education and community center. The former school building currently houses the Lower Price Hill Community School. The former St. Michael's sanctuary, is now known as The Sanctuary: Center for Education and the Arts and is being renovated into a space for a community directed center. The former rectory and annexes are currently being renovated into an artist community by BLOC Ministries and will also house other neighborhood outreaches (i.e.- BLOC, weightless anchors, and job skill programs).

Watkins Books

Watkins Books is London's oldest esoteric bookshop specializing in esotericism, mysticism, occultism, oriental religion and contemporary spirituality.
The book store was established by John M. Watkins, a friend of Madame Blavatsky, in 1897 at 26 Charing Cross. John Watkins had already been selling books via a catalogue which he began publishing in March 1893. The first biography of Aleister Crowley mentions that Crowley made all of the books in Watkins disappear and magically reappear.
Geoffrey Watkins (1896–1981) owned and managed the store after his father. He was also an author and publisher, with notable books including first publishing Carl Gustav Jung's 1925 edition of "Septem Sermones ad Mortuos".
In 1901, Watkins Books moved to 21 Cecil Court where it has been continuously trading ever since. It publishes a magazine called the "Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine", which has featured leading authors from mind-body-spirit and esoteric fields. Watkins Books has been owned by Etan Ilfeld since March 2010. Since then, a new website has been launched, and the store regularly hosts book launches and signings.

Figure of thought

Ancient rhetorical theory distinguished between form and content. As Gordon Williams states in introducing his study on "Figures of Thought in Roman Poetry", "Language was subject to ordering by exhaustive description of vocabulary, syntax, and figures. The content was likewise subject to ordering by the rules of "inventio" (the technique by which all the latent or inherent possibilities in a given idea or cluster of ideas could be 'discovered' and exploited)."
Figures of speech, however, are those we most commonly hear about, and virtually any reader can retrieve a definition of 'figure of speech', as in fact the existence of a Wikipedia entry for 'figure of speech' demonstrates. When it comes to describing a figure of thought, the task is not as comfortable as we might wish, especially when our primary area of inquiry is poetry rather than a prose composition, which adheres to the rules of rhetorical theory that were for the most part created in their fullest articulation in the age of Quintilian. In their approach to language, the Roman poets (Horace, Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus) did not distinguish between "inventio" and "elocutio", which explains somewhat our confusion between figures of thought and figures of speech. The latter are exemplified most immediately by conceptual substitutions, such as metaphor or synecdoche, but if we consider not just the mere linguistic aspect of the substitution and focus most closely on the concepts themselves, then we might begin to perceive the comprehensiveness of the conceptual for the poet, who operates with words to extend and amplify the potential semantics of poetic output.
In other words, if the poet says 'stars' to mean 'eyes', on the linguistic level we witness a conceptual substitution that plays on the gleaming of stars to describe human eyes, and thereby the object described acquires greater detail and more seductive features. The resulting effect of the substitution, however, also includes a fusion of concepts because the gleaming of stars and the gleaming of eyes are added to one another in thought, and the resulting meaning is a new and more potent concept than the one available in the two separate concepts of 'stars' and 'eyes', for after qualifying the eyes of a beloved as stars, the whole universe becomes readable in the beloved's eyes, and the eyes of the beloved are watching us from above on any given night.

<doc id="21455887" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21455887" title="Devonport Football Club">
Devonport Football Club

Devonport Football Club is an Australian rules football club based in Devonport, Tasmania. The club previously competed in the Northern Tasmanian Football League but from 2009 it joined the newly reformed Tasmanian State League.
Devonport joins the Northern Tasmanian Football League.
The collapse of statewide football in late 2000 saw Devonport revert to a regional competition, in this case the NTFL, but with only 9 wins from 20 matches for the year the club finished 8th (out of 12), a result it failed to improve on in 2002.
In 2003, however, the Magpies surged up the ladder to qualify for the finals, while the next year they went within one game – albeit a game in which they were conclusively vanquished by Burnie – of a flag. The 2005 season brought another grand final appearance, and another loss to Burnie, albeit this time by the comparatively more respectable margin of just 17 points. Then, in 2006, hopes that it might be third time lucky were conclusively dashed on grand final day by a much more talented and cohesive Launceston side, which ultimately won with ease by 57 points. The 2007 season brought a marginal decline in fortunes as the Magpies, having topped the ladder prior to the finals, bowed out of flag contention in straight sets after defeats by eventual premiers Launceston in the second semi final, and Ulverstone in the preliminary final. Kurt Heazlewood's Baldock Medal victory as the competition's best and fairest player provided a small measure of consolation.
Devonport joins the Tasmanian State League.
The Devonport Football Club accepted an invitation to join the new Tasmanian State League in 2009. After a meeting of club members, delegates and supporters, the club unanimously voted to leave the NTFL and join the new league. The club began their foray back into Statewide football with distinction in their first two seasons, with a first semi final loss to eventual premier Clarence in 2009 and a surprise Grand Final appearance the following season, again meeting Clarence at Bellerive Oval, but there was to be no fairytale as the Coastal Magpies were swept aside by the reigning premier by 57 points.
Financial ruin.
Just three months after competing in a Grand Final, financial disaster was to beset the club, on 10 December 2010 the Devonport Football Club was to announce that they were facing a debt of $507,525 and faced impending collapse should a white knight not be found. AFL Tasmania's CEO Scott Wade announcing that the club had fourteen days to prove to the sport's governing body that they were able to put plans in place to reduce the debt or they would face immediate expulsion from the Tasmanian State League for poor financial management. The NTFL stating that they would not let Devonport Football Club back into their competition should this eventuate and cross-town rival East Devonport refusing to enter into amalgamation talks with the club would most likely see the club go into extinction. The club is no stranger to financial turmoil, having been in trouble for most of the previous twenty years stemming back to their appointment of former Hawthorn legend Peter Knights as senior coach in 1990. By 1998 Devonport were close to extinction with a debt of $709,067 and were only saved by an approximately $246,000 loan from the Devonport Council in order to pay off some of their creditors. Urban legend amongst football writers and punters on the North West Coast was that the club were well known to have been in almost a quarter of a million dollars debt when they joined the TSL in late 2008, but the full extent of the financial problems were not known by AFL Tasmania until the sport's governing body appointed an independent administrator to oversee the running of the club in late 2010 whereby the extent of the financial problems were fully disclosed as Devonport Council also called in their loan to the club at the same time. After a change of board of directors, the club were granted donations of approximately $200,000 by a number of North Western businessmen and other supporters in the community and as such, were granted permission to remain a member of the Tasmanian State League.
Season 2011.
After being runners up to Clarence in the State League Final in 2010, there was an exodus of players at club while the coaching panel was being decided for 2011. Errol Bourn was appointed head coach after a long process but resigned due to personal reasons leaving the Magpies without a coach and players leaving. The Board then appointed former Ulverstone Under 19 Premiership Winning Coach Glen Lutwyche to the role. Due to the dire financial state of the club the board resigned in December following revelations the club was more than $500,000 in debt, with a $103,000 rescue package to meet immediate liabilities contingent on the majority of the board resigning, apart from directors Shane Yates, Shane Lee and Leon Perry. On 4 February, a special general meeting was called to introduce the new directors to the members and playing group. The new directors endorsed include multiple world champion woodchopper David Foster, former assistant coach Mark Fagan, former East Devonport Football Club president Peter Mitchell, former players Pat Fagan and Barry Duckett, supporter Peter McConnon, and marketing consultant Trudi Jones. Shane Yates was confirmed as the new president at this meeting. The playing group was left battered by the player exodus which included star midfielder Kurt Heazlewood moving to WA for work and forward Ben Reynolds signing at Glenorchy. The club has started to put back together there playing list by signing Ulverstone pair Justin Rodman and Tim Mee.
Season 2013.
After the departure of Glen Lutwyche as coach, the DFC brought in Paul Griffths to lead the team in 2013. After what some had described as a big pre season for the Magpies with an improved list and developing youngsters, Griffths' reign only lasted 5 games before he resigned. Griffths had only coached the team to a memorable ANZAC day clash win over eventual preliminary finalists Launceston in round three before he suddenly resigned after a big loss to South Launceston in round five. This brought under 18s coach Max Brown to the role of Senior coach where he set upon building the list and getting games in younger players. This strategy would come at a price with the Magpies only winning one more game for the rest of the year. Browns young team did show signs of improvement and with these good signs, Brown signed on to coach in 2014. Klay Griffths won his first Lance Cox Medal ahead of Quade Byard and Bodie Murphy won his first Noël Hetherington Memorial ahead of highly touted youngster Benjamin Hawkes. 
Season 2014.
Season 2014 has seen many new faces arrive at the club. Brayden Butler, Brayden Stevenson and Matthew Sheehan from Latrobe, Callen Newman from East Devonport and Scott Jaffery from Wesley Vale have all signed on for season 2014. The club also welcomes back Brad Symmons and Corey Plumbridge from injury and retirement. The club has loss Justin Rodman and Jack Vanderfeen to Ulverstone, Brennan Kendal to Queensland and Quade Byard to a knee injury.

March On! (You Fighting Sycamores)

"March On! (You Fighting Sycamores)" is the official school fight song of Indiana State University. The song and lyrics were written by ISU professor of music Joseph A. Gremelspacher as a pep song.
"March On!" was first performed at a Homecoming pep rally on October 20, 1939. "March On!" replaced "Cheer for the Blue and White" as the school's primary fight song.
"March On!" is performed by the "Blue Thunder" basketball band at every home basketball game, and by the Pride of Indiana at every home football game. When Indiana State wins, the band alters the fight song to have a waltz feel, which is known as "Waltz On!".

Wild Oak Music Group

Wild Oak Music Group (WOMG) is an independent record label operated out of the Music Industry program at California State University, Chico in Chico, California and was founded in the fall of 1997. The Wild Oak name was coined due to its surrounding environment of the city’s boisterous and edgy music scene paired with the historic oaks of magnificent Bidwell Park. Wild Oak Music Group, includes 15 separate departments all run by the music industry students themselves, such as Songwriter’s Guild and the Hip Hop Collective, Concert productions, Artist Management and Oak Leaf CD Duplication Services.
Mission statement.
Since its inception over a decade ago, Wild Oak Music Group's mission has been to “support and promote local and regional popular music.” To this end WOMG has released ten CDs, produced over 100 concerts, partnered with local businesses and organizations to raise money for worthy causes, managed local artists and assisted a generation of local songwriters to improve their craft and live performance skills.
History.
1997 - 2007.
Wild Oak Music Group first CD release was the spoken word "Music Industry 2000, A Symposium on the Future of the Music Delivery and the Web" (1998) featuring industry leaders speaking about the major issues facing the music business. Participants included: Jim McDermott (Polygram Records), Mike Farrace (Tower Records), David Pakman (eMusic CEO), Andrew Frances (management consultant for David Bowie and Garth Brooks) and David Sanjek (BMI). A year later, they issued "Chico Symphony Orchestra (1999)" performing a program of Beethoven and Mozart under the baton of maestro David Colson.
The first rock release came in 2001 with "Four Corners, A Compilation of Chico Music" featuring cuts from Chico stalwarts Electric Circus and Indecisive Youth and newer artists the Craze and El Diablo. Wild Oak reached out to regional artists next with their popular "Bands Gone Wild", a Northern California Compilation (2002),” showcasing Fresno’s 40 Watt Hype (who was featured on the "Adventures of Pluto Nash" movie soundtrack), Simplistic (who went on to sign to Linkin Park’s Machine Shop Recordings), Thirst (whose cut “In My Eyes” would gain significant North state radio airplay) and several other artists.
In 2003, Wild Oak celebrated indie music with "All Things Rock", highlighting local favorites Idle Discourse, Machine Green, Bear Hunter and others. This was followed by the 2004 "Chico State of Mind: A Party-Hop Compilation", featuring the hip-hop/dance sounds of Chico alums Mystic Roots, Pyrx, Derivative and many more.
Wild Oak Songwriter’s Guild got into the spirit with their "Volume I" (2005), a release of performances by members including Erin Lizardo, David Harris, Corey Nitchke and John Paul Guttierrez. A follow-up "Volume II" (2006), "Songwriters", contained performances from the Shimmies, Jonathan Leroy, JP and Dr. Lacubrious. WOMG went back to the ‘hood in 2006 with "The Mix Tape ‘06" and beats from the Dirt Merchants, the Hooliganz, Doctor Proper, Dusted Phoniks, Bugzy and others.
When Wild Oak promotes its featured artists and others, Wild Oak Concert productions presents shows in venues like: intimate all ages venues (Cafe Coda, Has Beans, and 1078 Gallery); clubs such as La Salles, the Brickworks and Off Limits; 1000 seat theaters (the Senator) and ballrooms (the BMU); and major outdoor celebrations on the Chico State campus such as the Warped Tour’s Ernie Ball Stage, Katrina Benefit (featuring Sublime Revisited) and New Orleans Benefit (featuring The Expendables). Chico Indie Fest I and II (2005, 2006) featured national artists Maxeen, Communique, Division Day and Narwhal at multiple venues throughout Chico. Throw in bi-annual high school Battles of the Bands and Chico rocks to the sound of Wild Oak Music Group.
2007 was a banner year for Wild Oak Music Group. They added a new EP duplication package to their professional quality duplication services they already offer. They began Wild Oak Artist Management to assist local artists in professionalizing their business practices, learn more about music marketing and conduct valuable career planning. Finally, they began WOMG Business Soundtracks, a service pairing customized CD compilations of Chico regional music with local businesses.

The Business Soundtracks division also released two compilations during the semester, a feat that was unprecedented. The first album, "Jambalaya", was created for Chico Bike and Board featuring artists from The Motorists, Broken Idols, and Andrea Desmond. The second album,"Peace of Mind", was created for Santy's Massage Parlor and included music by Soulifted, 10,258, and Prozak's Beat Factory.
2012.
Because WOMG's CEO Professor Paul Friedlander retired in the spring of 2012, the name Wild Oak Music Group was replaced with The School of the Arts Productions and the role as CEO was filled by Professor Anita Rivas. The name change was inspired by the combination of the Theater Arts department and the Music department at CSUC in 2012. Although the group has changed their name and image, they still maintain their old mission to “support and promote local and regional popular music.”
Departments.
The artist management department chooses bands and artists to work with who would like assistance with their career development. This includes press kits, show bookings, and promotion. In Spring of 2009 Artist Management has taken four local artists under their supervision; Andrea Desmond, Broken Idols, Esoteric, and Kyle Williams.
Arts 7 Graphics is charged with the task of developing and creating all of the visual art seen by the public including the logo, online banners, handbills, and posters of events and services.

Business Soundtracks division, added in 2007, focuses on connecting the community with its local musicians in an attempt to build a bridge between the two. This allows the business to grow, as well as a great way to promote the artist. In the spring of 2009 WOMG released a business soundtrack for Chico Bike and Board.

Media Relations gets the word out about Wild Oak through all forms of coverage and promotion. With Media Relations, Wild Oak is able to bring its events to the attention of the Chico community. 
Oak Leaf CD Duplication, added in 2007, acts as a key promotional tool for both WOMG affiliated artists and other members of the surrounding area in need of this service. Oak Leaf specifically offers a cheap, reliable way for artists to make professional copies of their music.
Outreach/Audience Development/Distribution Department is dedicated to creating a larger loyal audience for Wild Oak Music Group. Those within this department are in the Chico community and on the streets giving its members information. Outreach also gathers information from the audience to benefit them at our events.
Photo & Video collaborates with every department to help develop a respectable visual representation of what Wild Oak Music Group is involved in. From making music videos for featured artists, to filming live shows, the camera is always rolling, while the photo department creates lasting images that reflect the history being created for not only a record label, but an entire music scene.
The Songwriter's Guild is a division of Wild Oak dedicated to enhancing the overall quality of songwriting in Chico. They hold weekly meetings for local songwriters to share music in a friendly atmosphere. The Songwriter's Guild also organizes competitions and showcases in order to get our musicians' music heard by the community. In the fall of 2008 Songwriter's Guild successfully completed a compilation which included music by Kenny Williams Jr., Mandy Dobbelmann, Anthony Sarvedra, and Jeanette Hawkins.
Hip Hop Collective is a common place where producers, lyricists, and hip-hop heads alike will be able to come and share their work, projects, and ideas with others. Born out of the Songwriters' Guild, the Hip Hop Collective serves those who compose hip-hop by way of emceeing, beat production, turntablism, or beat boxing. Future projects will include the production of a Hip Hop Collective Mix tape, as well as showcase performances at a variety of Chico venues. Meetings consist of recording and collaborating on new music with other artists, learning techniques of recording, meeting with fellow producers to share work with, freestyle sessions, and weekly discussions regarding the future of hip-hop in Chico.
The talent department is similar to the position of Artists & Repertoire. This is primarily the task of finding talent for all Wild Oak shows. This also includes continually accepting songs from artists to be submitted to Wild Oak Music Group for affiliated artist program and business soundtrack department. The department works closely with artist management and the business soundtrack department.
The Web Department manages all of WOMG’s online content. The list of websites used by Wild Oak includes; wildoakmusicgroup.com, chicomusiccloud.com, a Facebook group, a Twitter account, a YouTube account, and a Myspace account for Songwriter's Guild.
The department of Chico Music Fest is responsible for the planning and execution of the annual Chico Music Fest. This year Chico Music Fest
will take place on Saturday May 9 and will include a total of 12 artists playing at 4 different venues. The director of promotions for Chico Music Fest is the face of Wild Oak seen by the outside businesses. This position has the sole responsibility of raising funds for CMF. These packets are taken to corporate and local businesses to get money/merch from these businesses.

Tom Page (footballer)

Thomas "Tom" Page (15 November 1888 – 26 October 1973) was an English footballer and international baseball player. He was the older brother of Louis Page.
Playing career.
Page played for Carada, Pembroke, and Rochdale, before spending six weeks at Everton in 1913. He then moved on to St. Mirren, and guested for South Liverpool during World War I. He had a trial with Liverpool before joining Port Vale for £400 in June 1920. He hit nine goals in 41 appearances in 1920–21, including one in the 2–1 Potteries derby victory over Stoke at The Old Recreation Ground on 25 September.
He was top scorer in the 1921–22 season with 10 goals in 39 games, helping the team to share the North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup in 1922. He also scored another goal against Stoke on 7 January, in a 4–2 defeat in the FA Cup First Round tie at the Victoria Ground. However he struck just once in 26 games in 1922–23. For the 1923–24 season he was joint-top scorer with Billy Briscoe, hitting ten goals in 39 games. He continued to be a bogey player for the "Potters", scoring in another 4–2 defeat on 13 October. He hit five goals in 29 appearances in 1924–25, as Vale finished eighth in the Second Division.
By 1925–26, Wilf Kirkham was the club's number one goal threat, though Page still managed 10 goals in 37 appearances. It was much the same story in 1926–27 and 1927–28, as he bagged 10 goals for three seasons running. However he was goalless in his seventeen appearances in the 1928–29 season, as the club were relegated into the Third Division North. Now at the age of 40, he was released, having played 302 games (286 in the league) and scored 65 goals (59 in the league) for the club. He still continued his career though, signing a contract with New Brighton, also of the Third Division North.

Khan Jaqmaq

Khan Jaqmaq () is one of the few remaining khans in the Old City of Damascus. at the intersection of Street Called Straight and Suq Bab al-Barid, it was built and named after Mamluk Prince Sayf al-Din Jaqmaq al-Argunsawi, governor of Damascus, in 1419-1420.
Architecture.
The building is a rectangular structure on two floors, accessed from the Street Called Straight by a monumental portal situated on its south façade. This portal is the oldest khan entrance in Damascus. On the east façade giving onto Suq Bab al-Barid and on the south façade flanking the portal are a series of shops of different sizes. Two shops are built into the gateway, which also has a single flight of stairs leading to the second floor. The gateway leads to the open-air courtyard, surrounded by shops on four sides, with a small fountain at the center. The second floor is composed of several rooms organized around a peripheral gallery, protected bordered by a wrought iron balustrade. 
The "khan", as it stands today, is occupied by a small family-run enterprise producing silk and clothes.

Janolus fuscus

Janolus fuscus is a species of sea slug, or more accurately a nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Proctonotidae.
Distribution.
The species "Janolus fuscus" is found from the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska to central California and also in northern Japan.
Habitat.
This species of nudibranch is found in shallow and subtidal waters.
Description.
The bodies of nudibranchs in this species are semi-translucent. The body is covered in short cerata. In "Janolus fuscus" the cerata are orange and white tipped.
Life habits.
"Janolus" species feed on Bryozoa. 
Predators.
In California, "Navanax" is a known predator of "Janolus". "Navanax" tracks the slime of "Janolus" by using chemoreceptors. When "Janolus" is about to be caught, it rolls into a ball, leaving its cerata exposed. If there is a water current, as if often the case, the sea slug may then be passively rolled away from the predator.

Chelsea Wetlands

Chelsea Wetlands is a 12 acre (≈4.9 hectare) marshland of the San Francisco Bay in Hercules, California.
History.
Originally part of a much larger system of wetlands lining the shoreline of western Contra Costa County, Chelsea is the remainder of the undeveloped coastal marshes of Hercules. Once home to egrets the marsh has been degraded by dumping of soil from surrounding construction projects. The site however remains crucial habitat to wildlife including endangered species such as the California clapper rail and salt marsh common yellowthroat. The marsh's host city is searching for funds to restore the creek and the flood plain surrounding it to protect against flooding to the adjacent neighborhood and to restore habitat for the living organisms that call the wetlands home.

<doc id="21456097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21456097" title="August of Legnica">
August of Legnica

Count August of Legnica (; ; Brzeg, 21 August 1627 – Siebenhufen near Przeworno, 14 May 1679), was a member of the House of Piast.
He was the ninth (fourth surviving) son of John Christian, Duke of Brzeg-Legnica-Wołów-Oława, but the first-born by his second wife Anna Hedwig of Sitzsch.
Life.
The marriage of Duke John Christian and Anna Hedwig was considered morganatic and in consequence all the eventual children born of them were excluded from the succession of the Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg. The status of Anna Hedwig changed considerably when she was raised to the rank of Baroness by Emperor Ferdinand II on 7 December 1627. Shortly after, on 18 February 1628, August was also raised to the Baronial rank with the title of "Baron of Legnica" (), a title who was secured for the future children of the couple. From August's six full-siblings, only two survive infancy: Baron Sigismund and Baroness Johanna Elisabeth of Legnica, by marriage Baroness Berka von Dub und Leipa. None of them leave descendants.
After the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, the young August and his family fled to Poland, first to Toruń and later to Ostróda, where his parents died in 1639.
August was raised to the Comital rank with the title of "Count of Legnica" () by Bohemian royal order at Regensburg on 12 January 1664. 
In 1675 his nephew George William, the last Piast Duke of Legnica-Brzeg, died without issue. Then August made his claim over the Duchies, as the last living male representative of the family (his younger brother Sigismund had died in 1664). The key of his eventual success was to demonstrated that the Agreement of 24 June 1626 who deprived Anna Hedwig of Sitzsch's descendants from the right of succession over Legnica-Brzeg was valid only if the descendants of Duke John Christian's first marriage were alive. 
August's claims were ultimately rejected, and in compensation, the Emperor Leopold I granted to him a high annual pension. From all the Legnica-Brzeg lands, August could retain only two districts: Przeworno and Kantorowice near Brzeg. 
August, the last male member of the Piast dynasty, died on 14 May 1679 in his castle of Siedminie ("Siebenhufen") and 28 September of that year he was buried in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Przeworno.
Marriages and Issue.
On 8 October 1653, August married firstly with Elisabeth (d. 24 April 1660), daughter of Johann Adam Raupowsky von Raupow, Baron of Ruppau, and widow of Karl Deodat, Baron of Zahradek. They had three children:
On 2 August 1665, August married secondly with Elisabeth Charlotte (b. Dillenburg, 2 June 1643 - d. Györ (Raab), Hungary, 2 March 1686), daughter of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg. This union was childless.

21st Century Breakdown

21st Century Breakdown is the eighth studio album by the American punk rock band Green Day. It is the band's second rock opera, following "American Idiot", and their first album to be produced by Butch Vig. Green Day commenced work on the record in January 2006 and forty-five songs were written by vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong by October 2007, but the band members did not enter studio work until January 2008.
The album was released May 15, 2009 through Reprise Records. Armstrong has described the album as a "snapshot of the era in which we live as we question and try to make sense of the selfish manipulation going on around us, whether it be the government, religion, media or frankly any form of authority". The singles "Know Your Enemy" and "21 Guns" exemplify the themes of alienation and politically motivated anger present in the record.
Critical response to "21st Century Breakdown" was generally positive. The record achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries, including the United States "Billboard" 200, the European Top 100 Albums, and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. It was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards held on January 31, 2010. As of December 2010, "21st Century Breakdown" has sold 1,005,000 copies in the United States and more than 4 million worldwide.
Writing and recording.
Green Day began to write new songs for what would become "21st Century Breakdown" in January 2006 after touring extensively in 2005 in support of their seventh studio album "American Idiot". At the time, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong stated, "We'll start with silence, and that's how we'll be able to find the inspiration to find another record." The band did not release any details of the writing and recording process until October 2007, when Armstrong said in an interview with "Rolling Stone" that he had written "something like 45 songs". The band members worked on the primitive conceptual stages of the album at their rehearsal studio in Oakland, California. Little was revealed on the themes or musical style of the album, but Armstrong pointed out, "I want to dig into who I am and what I'm feeling at this moment – which is middle-aged." He added that many of the 45 songs were written on piano rather than guitar.
Green Day began the recording process for "21st Century Breakdown" in January 2008. Later that year, it was confirmed that the band worked with producer Butch Vig. The album was recorded with Vig throughout 2008 and into early 2009 at four locations in California: Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, Studio 880 in Oakland, Jel Studios in Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa Studios in Costa Mesa. While recording in Hollywood, the band members bought cheap turntables from Amoeba Music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration, including albums by The Beat and The Plimsouls. Armstrong cited as inspiration the music of The Kinks' Ray Davies, The Pretty Things' "S.F. Sorrow", The Doors' "The Doors" and "Strange Days", and Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell". Drummer Tré Cool noted the influence of Eddie Cochran and The Creation on Armstrong's writing.
While writing at his home studio, Armstrong worked on a cover of The Who's 1966 mini-opera "A Quick One, While He's Away"; Green Day recorded a full-band version of the song during the album sessions. Vig noted that frustrations would sometimes cause delays in the recording process for "21st Century Breakdown". Armstrong kept his lyrics closely guarded and intentionally mixed his demos so that the vocals were low in the mix and thus unintelligible to the other band members. It was not until late 2008 that he chose to share his words with Cool, Vig, and bassist Mike Dirnt by sitting down with them and reading the entire album's lyrics aloud in order. The band members made the finishing touches on the album in early April 2009 and claimed that its release would lead to a "kind of... post-partum depression".
Themes and composition.
"21st Century Breakdown" continues the rock opera style of its predecessor, "American Idiot". The album is divided into three acts: "Heroes and Cons", "Charlatans and Saints", and "Horseshoes and Handgrenades" and is set in Detroit, Michigan. Its loose narrative follows a young couple named Christian and Gloria through the challenges present in the U.S. following the presidency of George W. Bush. Bassist Mike Dirnt has compared the relationships between the songs to those in Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run", saying that the themes are not as tightly interwoven as in a concept album, but that they are still connected. Many of the record's themes and lyrics are drawn from Armstrong's personal life and he sings in the first-person narrative style about abandonment and vengeance in "Before the Lobotomy", "Christian's Inferno", and "Peacemaker". "Rolling Stone" noted that the album is "the most personal, emotionally convulsive record Armstrong has ever written".
The title track's opening lyric "Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell" references Armstrong's birth year of 1972, while "We are the class of '13" references the fact that his eldest son, Joseph, will graduate from high school in 2013. Dirnt has expressed his belief that "Last of the American Girls" was written about Armstrong's wife Adrienne, who he claimed is steadfast in her beliefs and assertively defends them. Armstrong has cited his "disconnected" childhood—he was raised by his five older siblings after their father's death, while their mother worked graveyard shifts as a waitress—as the roots of the discontent expressed on "21st Century Breakdown". "East Jesus Nowhere" rebukes fundamentalist religion and was written after Armstrong attended a church service where a friend's baby was baptized.
Musically, "21st Century Breakdown" is similar to the punk rock style of "American Idiot", but many critics have claimed that Green Day's traditional sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while "Spin" called the title track "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked, "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education", but has noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing "21st Century Breakdown" by gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated, "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit you can sing about. It's just my DNA."
Promotion and release.
Green Day commenced work on the record in January 2006. The writing and recording process spanned three years and four California recording studios and was finished in April 2009.
On February 9, 2009, Green Day announced the album title and that the record would be split into three acts: "Heroes and Cons", "Charlatans and Saints", and "Horseshoes and Handgrenades". On March 17, a teaser trailer for "21st Century Breakdown" was posted on the band's website. The international release date of May 15 was announced on March 25. In early April 2009, Green Day premiered "Know Your Enemy" on television; a portion of the song was used as introductory music to the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament Championship game. The band first performed "21st Century Breakdown" in full during a string of California club shows in April 2009. At each show, concertgoers were given programs containing all of the album's lyrics. The first single, "Know Your Enemy", was released on April 16, 2009, and soon after the world premiere of the song's music video occurred on April 24 on the MTV UK website.
"21st Century Breakdown" was released internationally on May 15, 2009, through Reprise Records. The special edition vinyl version was limited to 3,000 copies and consisted of three 10" records, one for each of the album's "acts", a CD copy of the album, a 60-page art booklet, and a code for the digital download of the full album. The album artwork process was led by Chris Bilheimer and is based on a work from artist Sixten, who confirmed that the couple on the cover were "just friends of a friend at a party in Eskilstuna, Sweden" and explained that a mutual friend snapped a picture of the pair kissing. He added, "I love their passion, and just had to make a stencil out of it to spread the love." The cover art was noted for a marked similarity with that of Blur's 2003 album "Think Tank", itself a stencil by artist Banksy. Green Day showcased a collection of similarly themed art, called "The Art of Rock", at an art exhibition in London between October 23 and November 1, 2009.
The record reached number one on the "Billboard" 200 in the U.S., where it sold 215,000 copies in its first week, which was a shortened three days. The album remained at number one on the "Billboard" Top Rock Albums chart for three weeks. In Canada, the album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 30,000 copies in its first week. The album debuted at the top of sales charts in twenty four total countries, including a peak of number one on the European Top 100 Albums. "21st Century Breakdown" was only released in a Parental Advisory version containing explicit lyrics and content; Wal-Mart refuses to sell albums with a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members responded by stating, "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something." The second single, "21 Guns", was released to radio stations on May 25. The band embarked on a world tour in July 2009; the North American leg lasted through September and the European leg ended in November. "East Jesus Nowhere" was released as the album's third single on October 19, 2009.
Critical reception.
Reception to "21st Century Breakdown" has been generally favorable, according to aggregating website Metacritic, which reported a rating of 70/100 based on 30 critical reviews. Dan Silver of "The Observer" awarded the record four stars out of five and likened it to both Bruce Springsteen's music and the avant-garde writing of Chuck Palahniuk. "Rolling Stone"'s David Fricke called "21st Century Breakdown" "a compound bomb of classic-rock ecstasy, no-mercy punk assault and pop-song wiles; it's like The Clash's "London Calling", The Who's "Quadrophenia" and Hüsker Dü's "Zen Arcade" all compressed into 18 songs". Dan Cairns of "The Times" concluded, "Lyrically, it may succeed in capturing the contradictions, vulnerabilities and longing for harmony that thrum through Armstrong, Dirnt and Cool, their country, and humanity as a whole. But its real triumph, in an age of trimming, of market testing, of self-censorship and lowest common denominators, is not simply to aim insanely high, but to make it to the summit."
Criticism centered on the concept of the record; BBC's Chris Jones said that it is "griping vaguely against 'authority' " and that "too many buzz words obscure incisive meaning". Steve Kandell of "Spin" wrote that the humor of "American Idiot" was "sorely missed" and that the energy of the album seemed "directionless". "The Guardian"'s Alexis Petridis indicated that "the storyline becomes impossible to follow". Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic was the most critical professional reviewer of the album and questioned the clarity of the lyrics by calling "21st Century Breakdown" "more conceptually vague/ridiculous than "American Idiot""; he went on to say that it "spirals out of control in its own heroic glory and never regains focus, thus ending with a product that Green Day couldn’t afford to produce: an average record". Slant Magazine claims that "...an uncanny sense of familiarity hangs over too much of the album. The melodies of several tracks suggest ghosts of older Green Day songs."

The Final Test

The Final Test is a 1953 British sports film written by Terence Rattigan, directed by Anthony Asquith, and starring Jack Warner, Robert Morley, George Relph and Ray Jackson. A number of leading cricketers also appear including Denis Compton, Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook. The film was produced by R J Minney for Act Films Ltd.
Plot.
The film is a comedy drama, set around leading cricketer Sam Palmer's last appearance for England. He desperately wants his son to be there at The Oval to witness this, but the son is more concerned with meeting a leading poet Alexander Whitehead. Whitehead, it turns out, is more interested in cricket. Whitehead takes Reggie along to the match, in time to see Sam get out for a duck.
Cast.
The England cricketers Len Hutton, Denis Compton, Alec Bedser, Godfrey Evans, Jim Laker and Cyril Washbrook appear as themselves with John Arlott providing the match commentary.
Genesis.
The writer Terence Rattigan was an excellent cricketer in his school days. He played opening batsman for the Harrow Eleven, often in partnership with Victor Rothschild, and in 1929 he represented Harrow at Lord's in the annual match against Eton College. He originally wrote "The Final Test" as a television play in 1951, partly as a tribute to Sir Donald Bradman, who was out for a duck in his final test in 1948. That production was directed by Royston Morley and also starred Jack Warner.
As with almost all of Rattigan's plays, the theme of the relationship between father and son, and the tension between parental expectations and the son's driving force leading him in different directions, is explored.
It was filmed in 1953, directed by Anthony Asquith.
Media releases.
The film was released on Region 2 DVD on 6 August 2007.

Stoked (TV series)

Stoked (stylized as "Stōked") is a Canadian animated series produced by Fresh TV that premiered on Teletoon on June 25, 2009. It airs on Teletoon in Canada and ABC3 in Australia, and formerly aired on Cartoon Network in the United States. The series is from the same creators as "6teen" and the "Total Drama" series.
Plot.
"Stoked" is a character driven animated situational comedy about a group of groms who come together one summer on legendary Surfer's Paradise Hotel, British Columbia, to experience the ultimate surfer's dream — the endless summer. Emma, Reef and Fin join locals Broseph, Lo, her brothers George and Ty, and Johnny to work at the world renowned Surfer's Paradise Ridgemount Resort, stoked to have the summer of their lives. What they find instead—the worst jobs ever, hideous uniforms, zero respect, a run-down staff house, and a tacky, fake, kooksville resort. For twelve weeks, they will spend their first summer away from home and work the hardest that they have ever worked in their lives, but most importantly, they have the opportunity to surf on their days off.
Characters.
Main characters.
"Reef": 16 years old, and the new surf instructor of the resort, he has dreamed of going to Sunset Beach all of his life and finally made it. Reef's nickname comes from a surfing trip to Australia where he wiped out and "ate coral". His first name is actually Leslie and he is not proud of this name. Reef is extremely competitive and will go out of his way to tease and trash-talk Fin since he secretly likes her (only the guys and Lo know about it). In the episode "Who Knows What Evil Lurks In The Heart Of Clam?" when Reef starts dating a girl to make Fin jealous, he ends up begging Fin to help him get rid of her and he admitted that he only dated her to make Fin jealous. Reef also breaks many of Andrew's rules since he always wants to surf, which results in him being Andrew's least favourite employee. He is also vain and flirtatious and gets easily distracted by any good-looking girl. He wears a black and white T-shirt, navy blue shorts, and navy blue flip-flops and has a tribal tattoo on his right side of his chest. His board shorts are dark red like his surfboard. Reef has spiky auburn brown hair that he guards with his life, green eyes, and a muscular and tan body. He has also been proven to be scared of the dark and not very smart (as proven in "Grand Theft Whale Bus", when he did not know when 9:00 was). In the second season of Stoked, he dates Lo whom he loves, but does not think she is the ideal girlfriend. It is hinted in the intro that Reef and Fin end up as a couple together. He enjoys annoying Fin and knows she will eventually go out with him even though she refuses and acts like she hates him. Reef is voiced by Terry McGurrin.
Fin McCloud: She is the ultimate surfer girl: tough, fun and laid back. She is totally into girl power, which is something she and Reef argue frequently about. Originally, Fin was going to be Sunset Beach's new surf instructor, but instead ended up stuck as a maid with a hideous uniform. She and Reef tend to get into fights; he believes that boys are better at surfing than girls, though Reef has a crush on Fin. Fin refers to Reef as a kook. Fin also seems to possibly have a secret crush on Reef that Lo and Emma know about, though Fin will never admit it. However, in "Boards of Glory" she admitted to Reef that he is "kinda" cute but nothing more. She has four brothers and one sister whose name is Sam. She built the website, crustyhotelrooms.com, to show all the rooms in the hotel that are disgustingly dirty. Rosie, a senior maid, is basically the vice-president of the site. Fin wears a light green sleeve-less shirt, white and green capri shorts, and white sneakers. She has a lavender tie-dye surfboard, and her bathing suit is a yellow and purple surfing top that has the Fresh TV inc. logo with a purple bikini bottom. She has short blonde hair, blue eyes and a tanned and slim but fit build and is 16 years of age. She believes that women should not reveal their bodies so men can gawk at them by wearing bikinis that barely qualify as clothing. In "Will the Real Broseph Please Stand Up", Fin reveals that she is a native of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fin is voiced by Katie Crown. On March 10, 2009, Fresh TV started an official, in-character Twitter account for Fin, which has not been active since its most recent posting on April 25, 2011. In the intro, it is hinted that she and Reef end up as a couple, but he infuriates and annoys her. Overall she has a secret crush on him but is careful not to let it show.
Emma: Emma is from Calgary, Alberta, and before coming to Sunset Beach she had never surfed before. Emma was intent on surfing as soon as she saw a surf movie with her older brothers. At the resort, she works as a waitress in the dining room. She has a nice and easy-going personality and gets along with people, and is sometimes quite naive. Emma has red hair, green eyes and wears a baby pink top with pink shorts and a pearl necklace. Her bikini is light pink, and her surfboard is hot pink with a flower imprinted on the sides. Starting from the first season in the early episodes, Emma develops a huge crush on Lo's brother Ty (Tyler) but does not come up with the chance to tell him this. Johnny is shown to have a mad crush on Emma, but she is oblivious to this, resulting in Johnny's desperate attempts to impress her, even though she does not realize this as well. She is portrayed to be clumsy as she drops plates and items numerous times. She is shown to be one of the girlier characters, and is into all the lovey-dovey girlfriend and boyfriend gossip. In the second season, she can't stand the sight of Ty going out with Kelly (an antagonist in the series who works in the Pirate Ship restaurant) and teams up with Lo to destroy their relationship. She establishes good surfing skills throughout the series and competes in Gromfest, but ends up finishing 49th out of fifty competitors in the girls' category. Nevertheless, she was proud of this achievement as she wasn't placed last. Emma is voiced by Kristin Fairlie.
Broseph: He is a chilled-out local surfer, with wisdom that is not seen by many and is a loyal friend. When he notices Emma is sad about her awful first day, he teaches her how to surf. Broseph is also known to use certain things to his advantage, as seen in "Board and Confused", when he bribed Johnny with discounts at his mom's surf shop and having some of her famous jambalaya in exchange for light or no hazing. His name is a portmanteau of "Bro" and "Joseph", also with a connection to the term Brosef, which is Hawaiian slang meaning "bro". His hair has a hammerspace quality to it, pulling out objects that should not be able to fit inside, such as a huge submarine sandwich. Broseph is 16 and wears a blue gym shirt, white shorts, and brown flip-flops. His swimsuit looks like his shorts too. In the first episode it is revealed that instead of needing a job like most employees, he chooses to work there willingly instead of working at his mother's surf shop, claiming he needed a change of scenery. His job now is being a bellhop. Broseph believes that surfing should be done for the thrills, instead of surfing for publicity and fame. He doesn't believe in competition, which leads people to believe that he is a true surfer. Broseph's voice actor is Mazin Elsadig.
Lauren (Lo) Ridgemount: The daughter of the resort's owner, Lo's life has been that of a spoiled princess. However, after having an out-of-control party so big that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and local news station got involved, her dad comes up with the ultimate punishment for her: get a job at the resort (also preventing her from staying in the penthouse, and forbidding her to use her credit card in the process). Now with none of the luxuries of being a rich girl, she has to spend the summer in uniform and living in the staff house. She has since been trying to show her dad how responsible she is so he will let her move back into the penthouse. She has occupied several jobs throughout the two seasons. She is currently a housekeeper, having previously been a babysitter and a waitress. Although people think badly of Lo, especially her queen bee supervisor Kelly, she helped Emma get her job back in one episode, which shows she is not always a spoiled rich girl who only cares about herself. Having lived her whole life with no form of responsibility, Lo has no idea how the real world works. As a result, she has tendencies to leave work, thinking everything will be alright. She is good friends with Emma, but she knows that Emma has a huge crush on her older brother Ty, and Lo tries to make Emma move on to someone else instead of Ty. She also gets along well with Fin, despite their differences, and knew Johnny and Broseph as they are locals like her. After she gets stuck babysitting a bunch of brats that drive her crazy, Bummer assigns Lo as a permanent child sitter on certain days along with her regular job in the "D.R.". She wears a yellow Hawaiian dress and purple flip-flops. Her hair is long and brown with a purple flower hair clip. Her bikini is white with purple lining and her surfboard is yellow and purple. Lo is 15, the youngest of the main characters, and although she has not been seen surfing in many episodes, she has proven to be a very good surfer. It is hinted that Lo has a crush on Reef. She and Reef start dating in season 2 but by the end of episode 36 "Hunka Hunka Burning Reef", she ended her relationship with Reef. In a major continuity error however, she and Reef are inexplicably still dating in episode 39, "Clinging in the Rain" (with the storyline treating the relationship as if it never ended), but in episode 52, "Grom Fest", she ends the relationship with Reef for good and seems to be interested in Broseph. Despite her spoiled lifestyle, she has displayed (particularly in "The Day the Sea Stood Still") that she values her friends and is truly a grom at heart. She is voiced by Anastasia Phillips.
Johnny: He works at the front desk of the hotel. He befriends the group and even helps Emma keep her job by changing her evaluation scores. He worked at the Resort last summer, so he knows the ropes. Johnny also has a huge crush on Emma, which only Reef and Broseph know about, but due to her own crush for Ty, every time Johnny does or says something romantic to her, she is oblivious to his advances and mentions how Ty would love what Johnny just described. His crush on her may have ended in "Endless Bummer" when he discovered he was Emma's second choice. Johnny has a blue surfboard (actually Broseph's) and a navy blue and orange wetsuit. His normal outfit is a yellow shirt almost exactly like his work shirt, light yellow shorts, and black sneakers. Known by the groms as "Johnny Front Desk Guy" in the earliest episodes, he is very helpful to them and occasionally tells them advice when they are in a jammed situation. Johnny is the least fit of the six main characters and 17, the oldest of the main characters. Johnny is voiced by Arnold Pinnock.
Secondary characters.
Tyler (Ty) Ridgemount: Lo's 17 year old brother who also surfs. He has no clue of Emma's massive crush on him, even though it is very obvious. He has a hobby of recording surf videos and wishes to make a career out of it. He is portrayed to be an exceptionally skilled surfer. At first he could not remember Emma's name, though he makes up for it later. Despite Emma's many mistakes on him and his date at the theaters, spilling her drink on his date, showing "The Office" to a kook who later brings friends, and spitting a marshmallow in his eye, he does not get angry with Emma and is very patient and forgiving with her which might be signs that he may have some sort of feelings for her but it is not strongly stated. He also is close friends with the seniors. He and Kelly were dating until Ty found out (via Emma and Lo) that she was just using him to get to his family's money. Near the end of season 2, he and Kelly break up, resulting in a very angry Kelly, and a very happy Emma. Ty is 5 foot 10 (as estimated by Emma), has light brown hair, purple eyes and is tan. He is normally seen wearing green board shorts and a cream coloured T-shirt. He's your typical hot and hunky but polite type of guy. Unlike Reef, he's not a womaniser and prefers to keep things natural with the ladies. Ty is voiced by Jamie Spilchuk.
George Ridgemount: Lo and Ty's 10-year-old younger brother. He once burned down their boat house and has a pet spider named Shania Twain. He likes getting Lo in trouble. He is seen to have crushes on girls far older than he is and is selfish. In one episode (Waves of Cheese), it is shown that he does know how to surf. George is very cunning and cheeky, and often spends his time tormenting and playing practical jokes on Lo. He's shown to wear a light white top with blue board shorts, and has light blonde hair and purple eyes, resembling a miniature form of his older brother Ty. He is voiced by Gage Munroe.
Grommet: Grommet only appears in a few episodes. He is usually with George, being best friends. Grommet looks like a younger version of Broseph but it is unknown if they are related. In "Hang 9", he helps George get revenge on Lo for telling an older girl that he likes her. Grommet is usually quiet and mysterious. In another episode, he replaces Broseph as bellhop when Broseph wants to surf "El Dudarino", a wave that only comes once every 20 years. Even though Grommet doesn't talk at all during the series and that he looks like Broseph when he was younger, Bummer thinks it is Broseph who is working when it is actually Grommet. In "Waves of Cheese" it is shown that Grommet knows how to surf when he and George paddle out past Emma and Finn.
Ripper: A friend of the group and a soul surfer, he tends to make people laugh with his gas (hence his nickname), although the group just thinks that it is disgusting. He is best friends with Lance and Broseph and is occasionally ridiculed because of his blue hair. He also has very dark blue eyes and speaks with a heavy Australian accent. His ultimate dream is to become the world's best surfer. He is shown to usually be laid-back but is also very serious when it comes to certain things. Ripper works in water sports with Lance and Reef. He is returning staff from last year and is 17. He also happens to be a prankster, and because of that, he acts as an antagonist for Reef. In season 2, Ripper and Lance get up to mischief, resulting in Emma injuring her knee. Seeing this, Ripper blows on her grazed knee to sooth the pain, which Emma found quite nice of him to do. This leads to Emma and Ripper dating, but for a brief period. Ripper is voiced by Sergio Di Zio.
"No Pants" Lance: He is another of the returning staff and Ripper's best friend, and is normally the accomplice of Ripper when they get up to mischief. They think much the same, despite the fact that they are physical opposites. Lance has very short brown hair, brown eyes, and always wears swimming trunks, earning him his nickname. He is 17 and works at the water sports with Ripper and Reef as a life guard and possibly at the golf course, as shown in one episode where he is driving a resort golf cart. He is voiced by Corey Doran.
Kelly: A bossy, selfish, snobbish, and possibly sadistic girl and the secondary antagonist of the series who leads the staff seniors in their harassment and intimidation towards the groms. When the groms passed hazing initiation, she was the only staff member not to be impressed. She does not surf and instead loves to give Lo and Emma a hard time working as waitresses. She works as a dining room waitress and is Emma and Lo's immediate supervisor. She secretly seems to care about Emma (at least in the beginning), as shown in the episode "Penthouse of Horror". In "Charging Into the Night", she was tricked into going on a blind date with Bummer, resulting in her forcing him to pay for her meal and making it clear that she was miserable being stranded on the waterfront with him. In "Grand Theft Whale Bus", she is also shown to dislike Rosie. She later becomes a social-climbing gold digger when, knowing that Ty Ridgemount is Lo's brother and that Emma has a crush on him, she asks Ty out on a date and kisses up to his and Lo's parents purely to spite both Lo and Emma, who have tried in vain so far to expose Kelly and her true motivations to Ty and the rest of Lo's family. She is voiced by Lauren Lipson.
Rosie: She is a 35-year-old maid at Surfer's Paradise. While she apparently is not the head of Housekeeping (as the Head Housekeeper would not regularly clean rooms), she seems to have seniority or be at least the maid with the most experience. Also, according to Lo, Rosie has known her since she was a baby. In "Grand Theft Whale Bus", she has a distaste in Kelly for her snobbery. She is voiced by Fiona Reid.
Wipeout: Dressed in a purple orca costume, Wipeout poses as the resort's mascot, carrying around a portable stereo and dancing to greet visitors. His job is thankless however, as he gets little respect among peers and has been known to get left behind by the resort's tour bus. Wipeout's real face or body without the orca costume has yet to be seen. He is voiced by Sergio Di Zio.
Andrew "Bummer" Baumer: The day manager of the resort and the main antagonist of the show, he is stern and strict with the workers below him. His main ambition is his career, and besides Johnny he is one of the only characters to show any sense of responsibility. He is scared of Mr. Ridgemount and cares little about the employees. Reef and Broseph refer to him as a selfish dork. In order to surf at night, the groms had set him up on a blind date with Kelly (though both were enraged to be paired together) indicating that he is a young adult not much older than she is. He hates Reef the most out of all the employees. He is voiced by Cory Doran, who also voices Captain Ron.
Mr. Ridgemount: He is the owner of the resort and is the head of the Ridgemount Hotel chain of which Surfer's Paradise is the flagship property. Normally, very little of his face is seen; though in "Penthouse of Horror" all except his intimidating eyes were visible revealing that he resembles Coach Halder from 6teen. He always wears a black suit and is the father of Lo, Ty, and George. In "Another Grom Bites the Dust", Mr. Ridgemount mentions that his first job was working as a golf caddy; a possible reference to "Caddyshack", a movie with which Stoked shares the theme of being about teenagers with lousy summer jobs waiting on rich people. He is voiced by Jamie Watson.
Mrs. Ridgemount: She is Lo, George, and Ty's mother and a stereotypical trophy wife, although in a near death experience, Mr. Ridgemount flashbacks to them both being highschool or college sweethearts. She acts just like Lo, shirking responsibilities and accustomed to living the life of luxury. She also resembles Lo a few years into the future. She has Lo's back when trying to get Mr. Ridgemount to lighten up. She is voiced by Emilie-Claire Barlow.
The Kahuna: He is a very friendly person whose laid back personality resembles that of a flower child. He has an orange beard and vaguely resembles a younger George Carlin. Displaying numerous job talents, he appears to be a Jack of all trades, master of none. Among his many jobs and hobbies, he is the resort's tour bus driver, the owner of a movie theater specifically for surf flicks where he accepts anything as currency, is an avid taxidermist, and was seen making sandals out of palm trees. He has also been involved in some of the stranger events of the series, such as unknowingly reviving a fish stick as a revenge-crazed zombie.
Mark and Todd Marvin: Twin brothers who are guests at the resort. They are rambunctious children who get on everyone's nerves. They never listen to the employees and apparently do not want to surf, evident when Andrew gives them free surf lessons. They also seem to enjoy kicking Reef in the groin for fun.
Mr. & Mrs. Marvin: They are the parents of Mark and Todd, who frequently allow their children to run wild and engage in destructive behavior in the hotel, are very defensive for them, and think that the staff enjoys babysitting their unruly children. They either do not know what to do or are in denial of their children's behavior. However, in "Waves of Cheese", they were chastised by Johnny for their terrible parenting.
Sonny and Buster: A shark and a yellow tang who are two fish that reside in the Lobbyquarium. Buster is friendly and dimwitted, although he tries to be non-violent, and can have a mean streak. Sonny speaks with a New York accent, and makes bets with other fish in the aquarium.
Broadcasts.
"Stoked" has aired on a number of channels around the world.

Ethics and religious culture

Ethics and religious culture (Éthique et culture religieuse) is a course taught in all elementary and high schools in Quebec. It replaces the abolished subject of religious/moral education in these schools and is compulsory in all schools: private as well as public. The aim of the subject is to adopt a descriptive approach to the religious heritage of Quebec. The program's twin paramount principles are Recognition of Others and Pursuit of the Common Good. It is also claimed that the course will promote a “culture of dialogue” among students.
The project was adopted under the liberal government of Jean Charest, and has garnered some controversy. The first year this course has been taught is 2008-2009.
Controversy.
The course has been opposed by three main groups: 
Many condemned the fact that the State is imposing a vision of morals and religion (or lack thereof), while in a democratic society this is the purview of parents.
Court cases.
Two legal challenges were launched against the compulsory nature of this course.
Public school exemption.
A court case against the ERC curriculum was heard from the 11th to the 15th of May, 2009 in Quebec’s Superior Court in Drummondville. Two Catholic parents were challenging the school’s refusal of an exemption for both their first grader and their sixteen-year-old who was in last year of high school. They were arguing that the course’s contents put their children’s faith at risk by being premature, relativistic and polytheistic, and teaching ethics detached from the parents' moral framework. It was seen as a test case for Quebec parents.
The parents lost their court case and decided to bring their cause to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court granted the parents leave to appeal, but on hearing the merits determined that the appellants were unable to prove their case. 
The case was heard on the 18th of May 2011 by the highest tribunal in Canada. A summary of the legal issues at stake is listed on the Supreme Court's site. The parents' factum is to be found here.
Apart from the original parties, 8 additional parties were granted the status of interveners (a pointer is supplied to the party's factum):
The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada wrotea FAQ in layman's terms explaining what it saw as the issues at stake and how this court case differs from the Loyola one.
Two court reports were published, one in English by a writer of the Catholic register, another more detailed in French by a parent in favour of parents being exempt of this course if they so wish.
The Supreme Court heard the case and ruled that "...court cannot conclude that the appellants have been able to prove their case." 
The parents were awarded the Catholics Civil Right League's yearly award for their defense of parents' free choice in education.
Private school exemption.
A private Catholic high school, Loyola High School in Montreal, also launched a court challenge. Loyola High was challenging the fact that the Ministry of Education has not allowed it to teach what it deems an equivalent ethics and religion course better fitting the Catholic outlook of the school. It alleged that the Ministry had done so despite provisions in the law that would allow such an equivalent course. 
Loyola High won its court case and is now exempt for the ERC course and may teach its equivalent catholic course. On the 18th of June 2010, Superior Court Justice Gerard Dugre compared the attempt of the education minister to impose a secular emphasis on Loyola High School's teaching of the course to the intolerance of the Spanish Inquisition: "The obligation imposed on Loyola to teach the ethics and religious culture course in a lay fashion assumes a totalitarian character essentially equivalent to Galileo's being ordered by the Inquisition to deny the Copernican universe," the judge wrote in his 63-page decision, .
Surveys.
Several polls had shown the Quebec population to be polarized around this course. While 45% opposed the course in October 2008, 72% wanted parents to be able to choose the moral and religious training their children will get at school: the new ERC course or a traditional denominational religion course.
Jewish community response.
On May 28, 2009, the Canadian Jewish News announced the formation of a grassroots organization to represent "a response of Orthodox Judaism to the Ethics and Religious Culture program." The organization, calling itself the Council on Jewish Education in Quebec, commended the Quebec government for championing the cause of universal friendship among human beings, and for identifying "Recognition of Others" and "Pursuit of the Common Good" as values to be taught. However, the organization contended that because Orthodox Jews are required according to Torah law to limit their study of theology to the theology of the Torah, the curriculum should consist of the Noahide Code. The "Hade'ah Vihaddibur" online Orthodox Jewish weekly neawspaper reported a comparable sentiment expressed by the Israeli halakhic decisor Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Consistent with this response, the Montreal Gazette, in an op/ed published on June 6, 2009 (p. B6), noted that Quebec Jewish school curricula are exclusively loyal to the theology of the Torah.

The film starts with Maureen Brennan (Rosie O'Donnell) at a group home where she is giving a small introduction about the outlook for most of the group home children's futures (they'd either end living on the streets, in jail, or dead). A young America, emotionally vacant and suicidal, comes to the attention of Brennan. When she tries to talk to America, he refuses to give her any answers about his childhood. She helps him understand his troubled past in order to find the courage to survive. She also helps him forgive and forget and move forward.

List of Superfund sites in Oregon

This is a list of Superfund sites in Oregon designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law. The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a list of polluted locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations. These locations are known as Superfund sites, and are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for environmental remediation. As of April 2010, there were thirteen Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in Oregon. Four further sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list; none are currently proposed for entry on the list.

Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri

Abū Ibrāhīm K͟halīl Aḥmad ibn Majīd ‘Alī Anbahṭawī Sahāranpūrī Muhājir Madanī (; December 185213 October 1927) was a Deobandi Hanafi Islamic scholar from India who authored "Badhl al-Majhud", an 18-volume commentary on the hadith collection "Sunan Abi Dawud". He was also a Sufi shaykh of the Chishti order, being a disciple and successor of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi.
Name and background.
In one of his books he introduces himself as, "The humble servant, Ḥāfiz̤ Abū Ibrāhīm K͟halīl Aḥmad ibn Shāh Majīd ‘Alī ibn Shāh Aḥmad ‘Alī ibn Shāh Qut̤b ‘Alī." In the biographical work "Nuzhat al-Khawatir" it is written, "K͟halīl Aḥmad al-Anbeṭhawī as-Sahāranpūri: The Shaykh, the ‘Ālim, the Faqīh, K͟halīl Aḥmad ibn Majīd ‘Alī ibn Aḥmad ‘Alī ibn Qut̤b ‘Alī ibn G͟hulām Muḥammad al-Anṣārī al-Ḥanafī al-Anbeṭhawī, one of the righteous scholars and senior jurists and traditionists." In "Mu‘jam al-Ma‘ājim wa-al-Mashyakhāt" it is written, "The Shaykh, the Muḥaddith, the Faqīh, Khalīl Aḥmad ibn Majīd ‘Alī […] al-Anṣārī al-Ḥanafī al-Anbayt′hawī as-Sahāranfūri al-Muhājir al-Madanī, one of the senior scholars of India." Husain Ahmad Madani writes in the introduction to "Badhl al-Majhud", ""Mawlānā" Abū Ibrāhīm Khalīl Aḥmad, al-Ayyūbī al-Anṣārī by lineage and origin, al-Ḥanafī ar-Rashīdī by "mashrab" (spiritual disposition, lit. 'spring') and "madhhab" (legal school), and al-Jishtī al-Qādirī an-Naqshbandī as-Suhrawardī by "ṭarīqah" (Sufi order) and "maslak" (track)."
His given name was Khalil Ahmad, while Abu Ibrahim was his kunya. He was Ayyubi and Ansari, as his family claimed descent from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was Anbahtawi (of Ambehta, referring to his family home), then Saharanpuri (of Saharanpur), then Madani (of Medina). The nisbat Muhajir Madani indicates his permanent migration ("hijrah") to the holy city. He followed the Hanafi school of "fiqh" (Islamic jurisprudence), and in "tasawwuf" (Sufism) he was a disciple of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi in the Sabiri-Imdadi chain of the Chishti order, which incorporates the Chisti, Qadiri, Naqshbandi, and Suhrawardi orders.
Early life.
Khalil was born toward the end of Safar 1269 AH (December 1852) in Ambehta, a town in the district of Saharanpur in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, India. He was named both "Zahiruddeen" and "Khalil Ahmad", but Khalil Ahmad became his official name.
His mother, Bi Mubarak an-Nisa, was the daughter of Maulana Mamluk `Ali and the sister of Maulana Muhammad Ya`qub Nanautawi.
Khalil commenced his studies at an elementary school at the age of five. Maulana Mamluk `Ali conducted his "bismillah" and Khalil soon completed the recitation of the Qur'an. He then studied the primary books of Urdu and Persian under various ulama in Ambehta and Nanauta. Thereafter, he accompanied his paternal uncle, Maulana Ansar `Ali, to Gwalior, where he studied the primary texts of Arabic grammar—"Mizan as-Sarf", "Sarf Mir", and "Panj Ganj".
Thereafter, Khalil returned home, where his education was assigned to Maulana Sakhawat 'Ali Anbahtawi. During this period, some of his relatives insisted that he be enrolled at an English school. Though he did not want to, he commenced his secular studies. When Darul Uloom Deoband was opened in May 1866 and his uncle, Maulana Muhammad Ya'qub, was appointed as the "sadr mudarris" (head teacher), Khalil took permission from his parents and travelled to Deoband, where he commenced studies from "Kafiyah". Six months later, in November 1866, Mazahir Uloom Saharanpur was established. There, another maternal uncle of Khalil, Maulana Muhammad Mazhar, was appointed "sadr mudarris". Khalil transferred to Mazahir Uloom Saharanpur, where he entered the class of "Mukhtasar al-Ma’ani".
Khalil commenced his studies in hadith by studying "Mishkat al-Masabih" in 1868. The following year, he studied "Sahih al-Bukhari" and "Hidayah".
Khalil completed his academic studies and graduated from Mazahir Uloom in 1871.
"Bay'at".
One day, Moulana Khalil's paternal uncle, Moulvi Ansar 'Ali, said, "After your studies, you should acquire tasawwuf from Moulvi Saab (i.e. Gangohi)". At around this time, Moulana Khalil's marriage was conducted with a woman from Gangoh. Thus, he passed much of his time in Gangoh. While in Gangoh, Khalil remained in the blessed company of Gangohi. However, the thought of requesting Khalil for "bay'at" did not occur to him. However, after his graduation, the idea of "bay'at" did occur to him. Coincidentally, Moulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi arrived. At night, in privacy, Moulana Khalil said, "I have the thought of "bay'at". In our surroundings, there are several "buzurgs". I do not know what is best for me. If you feel that it is best for me to enter into the association of your "khuddam", then do accept me. However, instruct me according to what you feel is best for me." In reply, Moulana explained that there was none better than Moulana Rashid Ahmad for this. Moulana Khalil then said, "He is extremely reluctant regarding "bay'at". However, if you intercede on my behalf, then this matter will be finalised." He responded, "Good, when I come to Gangoh, be there." Thus, when he was informed that Moulana was travelling to Gangoh, Moulana Khalil immediately did the same. In the morning, after he had conversed with Gangohi, he called Moulana Khalil. Moulana Khalil entered, greeted Gangohi, and sat down. Gangohi, with a slight smile, said, "Humble and lowly people become my "murids". You are the son of a "pir" and selected one. Why do you wish for your "bay'at" to be accepted by me?." This statement incapacitated Khalil's senses and he stammered, "‘Hazrat, I am worse, more contemptible, and useless than them (the humble folk)." Gangohi responded, "Enough! Enough! Make Istikhara. I am coming to the masjid". Moulana Khalil immediately proceeded to the masjid, performed wudhu, and performed Istikhara. On his arrival, Gangohi instructed Moulana Khalil to repent and initiated him into the System of Subjection thereafter.
Career.
In 1871, Khalil became a teacher at Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur. His monthly salary was three rupees. However, soon after, he proceeded to Lahore to pursue further studies in 'Uloomul 'Adabiyya. He remained in Lahore for a few months. After studying "Maqaamaat" and "Mutanabbi" under Moulana Faidhul Hasan, he travelled to Deoband. Moulana Ya'qub arranged for him to be employed as the translator of "Qaamus" into Urdu. The monthly salary was ten rupees. He was sent to a mountain to execute this task and returned after approximately two months. Thereafter, he became the principal of Manglore's madrasa. At around this time, an offer of employment from Bhopal arrived for Maulana Ya'qub for a monthly salary of three hundred rupees, but he declined the offer. However, he was pressed to send another reliable person to occupy the post, so he decided to send Khalil. By the choice of his honourable uncle and on the approval of Gangohi, he departed in 1293 AH to occupy the post in Bhopal at a monthly salary of fifty rupees. However, due to his dislike of Bhopal and its atmosphere, Khalil resigned and requested permission to return. In accordance with the instructions of Moulana Gangohi, Khalil remained in Bhopal until the Hajj season. Khalil then departed from Bhopal with a few months of salary in advance.
After returning from his first Hajj, Khalil passed a few days in his hometown. Thereafter, he departed for Sikandarabad in the Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh in Jumadul Awwal of 1294 AH, where he became a teacher at the Madrasa 'Arabiyya of Jami’ Masjid. However, the people there vehemently opposed him. Thus, he sought permission from Gangohi to return. However, Gangohi refused. Despite Khalil's affection and affability, the intransigence of the people increased. Thus, with the permission of Gangohi, Khalil resigned and returned. In 1295 AH, a letter from Moulvi Shamsuddin, Chief Justice of Bhawalpur, was sent to Moulana Muhammad Ya'qub. The letter was a request for a highly qualified teacher. Moulana Ya'qub selected Khalil for this post. Finally, upon the instructions of Moulana Ya'qub and Moulana Gangohi, Khalil accepted the post in Bhawalpur at a monthly salary of thirty rupees.
Thereafter, Khalil returned to Saharanpur and resumed his post as a teacher there. He soon progressed into a senior teacher and taught "Tawdih Talwih", "Hammaasa Rashidiyya", "Sharhul Wiqaayah", "Shara Nukhbatul Fikr", Mu'atta Imam Muhammad, and "Siraji". The following year, together with several "kitabs" of various subjects, Khalil taught Sahih al-Bukhari, Sunan Abu Da'ud, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, and Sahih Muslim. Khalil, together with internal spiritual knowledge, also possessed external theoretical knowledge. He could lecture on any "kitab" with ease and possessed perfect methodology. Even Moulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri would visit Khalil for advice and guidance in his writings and discourses.
Journeys for Hajj.
Khalil performed seven Hajj in his lifetime. His first Hajj occurred in 1293 AH, while he was in Bhopal. Although he did not possess sufficient money, his enthusiasm compelled him to proceed for Hajj. On reaching Mecca, he presented himself at the home of Haji Imdadullah. After completing Hajj, his intention was to proceed to Medina. Thus, Khalil departed for Medina. He remained there for about two weeks, after which he returned home. During this journey, Khalil received "ijaazah" in hadith from Shaikhul Haram Ahmad Dahlan and Shaikhul Mashaa'ikh Shah Abdul Ghani Mujaddid An Naqshbandi Ad Dehlvi. The "ijaazah" from Shaikh Ahmad Dahlan was acquired in Mecca, while that of Shah Abdul Ghani was obtained in Medina in 1294 AH.
Khalil's second Hajj occurred when he was in Bhawalpur in Shawwaal of 1297 AH. When he departed for Hajj, Moulana Gangohi wrote to Haji Imdadullah requesting him to confer the mantle of "khilaafah" onto Khalil. Thus, on seeing Khalil, Haji became overjoyed. In Muharram of 1298 AH, he presented the document of "khilaafah" adorned with his seal to Khalil. In a state of elation, Haji placed his turban on Khalil’s head. Khalil presented both of these gifts to Gangohi and said, "I am not deserving of these. This is only your affection and grace for me." Gangohi replied, "May these be blessed for you. He then signed the "Khilaafat Naama" and handed it with the turban to Khalil. However, the respect of Khalil was such that whenever he would initiate a "murid", he would instruct the "murid" to proclaim, "I have made "bay'at" to Hazrat Moulana Rashid Ahmad Saab at the hands of Khalil Ahmad".
Khalil's third and all subsequent Hajj journeys were undertaken from Saharanpur. The third Hajj was after the demise of Gangohi. Consolation for the immense grief that he suffered as a result of this event could only be obtained from the grave of Muhammad.
Khalil's fourth Hajj was performed in 1910. He departed from Saharanpur in the middle of Dhul Qa'da and reached Mecca on 8 December. After Hajj, he travelled to Medina via Yambu’. He remained there for twenty-two days and then returned to Saharanpur at the end of Safar in 1329 AH.
Khalil's fifth Hajj was a momentous occasion which occurred in Shawwaal of 1332 AH in the company of Shaikhul Hind. In Mecca, on account of the oppression of Sharif Husain, Khalil was compelled to return before Hajj. He departed from Mecca at the end of Shawwaal and his ship arrived in Bombay on 6 September 1916. However, as he alighted from the ship, him, his wife, and his brother, Haji Maqbul Ahmad, who was his right-hand man, were arrested. All three of them were transported to Nanital with their luggage. They were released shortly after.
Khalil's sixth Hajj occurred in 1920. He departed from Saharanpur on 21 April 1920 and reached Mecca on 29 May. Despite his weakness and dizziness due to seasickness, Khalil led Tarawih Salaah while standing. He would recite half of a "para" in eight rak'aats. When Khalil arrived in Mecca, Moulana Muhibbuddin Muhajir-e-Makki, while embracing him, said, "Moulana, why have you come here? The greater Qiyaamah is about to be enacted here. Return immediately to India after Ramadan". Thus, Khalil said to his companions, "It was my intention to reside in Medina, but Maulana Muhibbuddin Saab vehemently forbids it. I have already visited Medina several times. Since this is your first Hajj and it is unknown if you will receive this opportunity again, proceed to Medina". Khalil reached Saharanpur in Safar of 1339 AH.
Khalil's seventh Hajj was the journey during which he bid a final farewell to India. On the insistence of his attendants from Hyderabad, it was arranged for Khalil to remain in Hyderabad for a week. Khalil departed from Saharanpur for Hyderabad on 29 April 1926. After his sojourn in Hyderabad, he left for Bombay. He departed from Hyderabad at 9:00 AM on Saturday, 8 May 1926 and arrived in Bombay the following morning. From Bombay, the ship on which he was travelling departed on 19 May 1926. The ship arrived in Kamraan on 29 May 1926, left Kamraan on 30 May 1926, and arrived in Jeddah on 2 June 1926. From Jeddah, the journey to Mecca was by camel. The party reached Mecca on 6 June 1926. Khalil had rented a house on a narrow street opposite Babul Ibraheem, where he remained with three or four of his attendants. On 8 June, they left for Mina. Khalil and his wife rode one camel. In Mina, they remained in the tent of the "mutawwif". One tent was for the ladies and another tent was for Khalil and his attendants. After Hajj, they remained in Mecca for a few days. It was then decided to proceed to Medina. The departure was planned for 24 June, but the government confiscated twenty-three camels, which resulted in a delay of two days. They arrived in Medina on Monday, 19 July 1926 at the time of Chasht. Aqdas Moulana Al-Haj Sayyid Ahmad had rented a house in Madrasa Shari'a Qadim. He occupied the ground floor of this house. Khalil occupied the second floor. The third floor was occupied by Moulana Sayyid Ahmad's womenfolk. Adjacent to this was the residence of Khalil’s womenfolk.
After Ishraq Salaah, Khalil would remain in his room for a few hours in complete solitude, engrossed in writing "Badhlul Majhud". After the completion of "Badhlul Majhud", this portion of the morning was utilised to study "Wafa ul Wafa" and other "kitabs" which had accumulated during Khalil’s sojourn in Medina. During Ramadan, Khalil would engage in recitation of the Qur'an after Ishraq Salaah for a considerable time. If it was not Ramadan, he would partake of a meal in the same room thereafter. After his meal, Khalil would rest in the "zanaana". If it was Ramadan, he would rest in the "zanaana" right after he completed his morning activity. After a siesta, he would depart for Masjid un Nabawi before "Zawwaal". He would return home after Dhuhr Salaah. There, he would engage in the recitation of the Qur’an for approximately an hour. Thereafter, he would occupy himself by studying "Wafa ul Wafa". After Asr Salaah, he would proceed to the home of Moulana Sayyid Ahmad and remain there until Maghrib Salaah. Here, Khalil held a "majlis", which was open to the public. In Ramadan, he would leave for Masjid un Nabawi shortly before Maghrib Salaah and partake of "iftar" there with dates and Zam-Zam water. After Maghrib Salaah, Khalil would recite two "paras" of Qur'an in Awwaabin Salaah on the roof of Madrasatul 'Uloom Shari'a in a sitting position. After 'Isha Salaah in Masjid un Nabawi, Khalil would return to the madrasa and perform Tarawih Salaah behind Qari Muhammad Taufiq. Tarawih Salaah would end at approximately 12:30 AM. He would then retire to bed at approximately 1:30 AM and instructed his attendants to awaken him at 3:30 AM.
On his arrival in Medina, Khalil engrossed himself in the completion of "Badhlul Majhud" which had reached a length of four volumes prior to his arrival in Medina. When he arrived in Medina, he commenced "Kitabul Jana'iz". The solitude which Khalil had coupled with the "baraka" of Medina enabled him to complete one and a half volumes in seven and a half months. The work was written in Moulana Sayyid Ahmad’s room. However, for the acquisition of "baraka", it was completed at "Raudatu min Riyadhil Jannah" in Masjid un Nabawi. On the completion of "Badhlul Majhud", Khalil was overwhelmed with happiness, so he invited the 'Ulama of Medina for a lavish feast.
Last Years & Death.
Towards the end Ramadaan, Khalil became affected with paralysis and moved about with difficulty. The paralysis had started after the completion of "Badhlul Majhud", when he became ill. However, this illness disappeared with the dawn of Ramadaan. However, the illness reappeared two or three days before Eid ul-Fitr and then paralysis set in. At the end of Ramadaan, he experienced the effects of partial paralysis. Even on Eid ul-Fitr, the effect of the paralysis was predominant to such an extent that he was unable to attend Salaatul 'Id in the Haram. However, when he regained his strength, he limped to Masjid un Nabawi with a cane. In the month of Rabiul Akhir in 1346 AH, the severity of his illness intensified. His fever and paralysis increased. Sometimes, when the severity of his illness increased, he could not attend salaah at Masjid un Nabawi. However, when he felt somewhat better, he would go to Masjid un Nabawi with the support of a cane and the aid of one of his attendants. In the first week of Rabiul Aakhir in 1346 AH, he experienced pain in his chest, which would disappear when he was massaged. In the second week, on the request of some of the 'Ulama of Medina, Khalil started to teach Sunan Abu Da'ud after 'Asr Salaah at the residence of Moulana Sayyid Ahmad. After conducting lessons for a weekend, while returning from Dhuhr Salaah on Monday, Khalil complained of more pain in his chest. He added that he had felt a similar pain three or four days earlier, which disappeared within two or three hours after a massage. On reaching the house, he was massaged. At the time of 'Asr Salaah, although the pain had decreased, weakness did not permit him to attend salaah in the Haram. Thus, he performed 'Asr Salaah at home behind Moulvi Sayyid Ahmad. Despite his weakness, he stood and performed his salaah. His weakness increased and, instead of feeling feverish, he started to feel cold and perspired. He could not perform Maghrib Salaah while standing. Thus, he sat and requested Moulvi Sayyid Ahmad to perform the salaah quickly. His condition deteriorated and he performed 'Isha Salaah while seated on his bed. He passed the night in restlessness while constantly performing "dhikr". He did not sleep at all. On Tuesday morning, Khalil performed Fajr Salaah while seated on his bed. His perspiration and coldness continued to increase. Medicine was administered for a day. At the time of Dhuhr Salaah, Khalil was overcome with weakness to such an extent that he was unable to perform wudhu. Thus, he performed "tayammum" and then performed salaah while seated on the bed. Thereafter, movement became difficult. By the time of 'Asr Salaah, his condition had further deteriorated. He performed 'Asr Salaah with much difficulty. By Maghrib Salaah, he no longer had any strength to lift himself. Besides "Pas Anfas", which is a method of dhikr by breathing, Khalil did not do anything. He did not respond to any conversation nor did he ask any questions. Twenty-four hours passed in complete silence and on Thursday, 13 October 1927, Khalil died as he repeatedly proclaimed "Allah!" aloud. Then, his eyes closed and he became silent. Allah yarhamu, Ameen.
Funeral.
Despite the small amount of time available, funeral arrangements were accomplished successfully. Sayyid Ahmad Tawwaab performed the ghusl while Abu Sa'ud poured the water. Moulvi Sayyid Ahmad and Moulvi Abdul Karim assisted. The Janaaza was prepared, brought outside Masjid un Nabawi, and placed near Babul Jibra'il for Salaatul Janaaza. After Maghrib Salaah, Moulana Shaikh Tayyib, the rector of Madrasa Shari'a, led the Salaatul Janaaza. The Janaaza then proceeded to Jannatul Baqi thereafter. Khalil was buried in his grave shortly before 'Isha Salaah.

Karatiyya

Karatiyya () was a Palestinian Arab village of 1,370, located northeast of Gaza, situated in a flat area with an elevation of along the coastal plain of Palestine and crossed by Wadi al-Mufrid. 
History.
The place called "Kulat el Fenish" by the village was apparently once a church.
In the 12th century, a castle called Galatie was built on the village site by the Crusaders and was subsequently captured by the Ayyubids under Saladin in 1187. In 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of the village under Ayyubid rule as "Karatayya" as "a town near Bait Jibrin, in the Province of Filastin. It belongs to Jerusalem. The Mamluk sultan al-Nasir ibn Qalawun camped in Karatayya in 1299 on his way to fight the Mongols. 14th-century Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi reports that at times it was a part of Mamlakat Ghazzah ("Kingdom of Gaza"). 
In 1596, while under Ottoman rule, Karatiyya was under the administration of the "nahiya" of Gaza, part of Sanjak of Gaza. A population of 253, it paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit, vineyards, beehives, and goats. In the 19th century, a ruined tower stood atop a mound just outside the village which was built in an open plain.
During the British Mandate of Palestine period in the 20th century, the village houses were built of adobe brick and it relied on the nearby town of al-Faluja for medical, commercial, and administrative services. Karatiyya itself, had a mosque, a grain mill, and an elementary school—the latter was built in 1922 and had an enrollment of 128 students in the mid-1940s. Domestic water was supplied by two wells dug within the village and the primary agricultural crops were grain and prickly pears.
1948 War, and aftermath.
As a part of a new policy the Haganah blew up a house in Karatiyya on the night of December 9, 1947, the orders to the Givati Brigade who executed the order had been for "two houses".
Karatiyya was captured by the Israeli Army's 89th Mechanized Battalion, commander Moshe Dayan, on July 18, 1948 as part of Operation Death to the Invader. Its inhabitants fled upon their arrival, according to Dayan. According to Benny Morris, the village "was harassed by machine-gun fire and abandoned by its inhabitants". Israeli forces intended to link their northern territory with that held by Israeli forces in the Negev, but succeeded only partially, only taking control of Hatta and Karatiyya. After it was stormed by Dayan's troops he controversially withdrew them leaving a Givati infantry company to hold the position. A fierce battle ensued between them and the Egyptian Army who got as far as the village outskirts. When two Egyptian tanks were on the verge of breaking the Israeli defenses from the south, a unit hiding behind a wall of prickly pear cacti, armed with anti-tank weapons "changed the course of the battle", according to Haganah accounts.
On August 20, 1948, Ben-Gurion together with Yehoshua Eshel, presented a plan for 32 new Jewish settlement on newly depopulated Palestinian villages, for Karatiyya one proposed a settlement named Otzem or Komemiyut
Three Israeli settlements were eventually founded on village land: Komemiyut in 1950 and Revaha in 1953, close to the village site. Nehora, established in 1956, is partly on village land, and partly on land belonging to al-Faluja.
The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described Karatiyya in 1992: "Piles of debris are scattered on the site, and a destroyed cemetery (partially hidden among eucalyptus trees) can be seen. An agricultural road runs through it. Grain and alfalfa are grown by Israeli farmers on the site and surrounding lands."

Kim's Video and Music

Kim's Video and Music was a video and music retail store in the East Village of Manhattan, New York City, described as the "go-to place for rare selections" and "widely known among the cognoscenti of new, experimental and esoteric music and film". Its owner is Yongman Kim. 
History.
It opened at the site of Kim's dry cleaner business and eventually moved to its own location on Avenue A in 1987. It expanded to five other locations, including St. Mark's Place (Mondo Kim's) in the East Village, Kim's Underground at 144 Bleecker Street (on Laguardia Place), and Kim's West (350 Bleecker Street & West 10th Street). By 2008, it had over 55,000 rental titles, many of which were rare or esoteric. 
The original Avenue A location closed in 2004 and was much missed by customers despite its reputation for rude and opinionated employees. [http://gothamist.com/2004/10/18/kims_video_closes_its_mean_location.php] Mondo Kim's, to a lesser extent, also had a reputation for "ornery" service. 
In June 2005, police raided Mondo Kim's, alleging they were selling bootlegs. 
In September 2008, Kim announced he would be closing Mondo Kim's and giving away the film collection to anyone who could fulfill certain criteria, stipulating that the entire collection was to be taken intact and that Kim's members would continue to have access to the collection wherever it resided. In December 2008, it was reported that Salemi, Sicily had made a successful bid for the collection, as part of a village restoration effort. In 2012, a Village Voice article entitled "The Strange Fate of Kim's Video" reported that the collection, though remaining intact, had essentially disappeared from public view after arriving in Salemi, and that the initiatives promised by Kim and the government of Salemi remained unfulfilled. 
The last remaining location of Kim's Video & Music, located on 1st Ave, announced its closure on 21 April 2014.

Craig Mullaney

Craig M. Mullaney (born c. 1978) is a United States Army veteran and the author of "The Unforgiving Minute: A Soldier’s Education" (Penguin Press). He was Senior Vice President of Content, Strategy and Operations at Ustream from 2011 to 2013. He also served as Senior Policy Advisor working for the United States Agency for International Development.
Early life, education and family.
Raised in a blue-collar family in Rhode Island, Mullaney was the Bishop Hendricken High School valedictorian and was selected for nomination to the U.S. Military Academy in 1996. While a cadet, Mullaney double-majored in French and History, served as the cadet brigade operations officer in his senior year, and completed over 400 jumps as a nationally ranked member of West Point's sport-parachute team. He graduated second in the West Point Class of 2000.
Mullaney attended Lincoln College at the University of Oxford from 2000 to 2002 as a Rhodes Scholar. He earned a Master of Science degree in Economic and Diplomatic History and a Master of Studies degree in Historical Research. During this time he traveled to over thirty countries.
Mullaney was married to Dr. Meena Seshamani, M.D., Ph.D., formerly an otolaryngology resident physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital, a published health economist and currently Deputy Director in the Office of Health Reform in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. They met at Oxford where Dr. Seshamani was a Ph.D. Marshall Scholar and he was a Rhodes Scholar.
Military career.
Prior to arriving at Oxford, Mullaney completed Ranger School at Fort Benning, Georgia, a grueling nine-week course designed to test small-unit leadership by simulating combat stress through strenuous tactical exercises. When Mullaney returned to the United States in 2002, he completed additional infantry training and joined the 10th Mountain Division, which had recently returned from Afghanistan. In 2003, Mullaney served as an infantry officer with the 10th Mountain Division as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, where he led a rifle platoon along the hostile border with Pakistan. His platoon operated along the entire spectrum of combat operations—from humanitarian assistance to full-scale combined arms against al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. Mullaney's platoon was the most decorated in Afghanistan during its tour and was commended in person by General Richard Myers, General John Abizaid, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Mullaney was recognized with the Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal for Valor, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.
After his tour in Afghanistan, Mullaney served in the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), in Arlington, Virginia. At this elite ceremonial unit, he planned portions of the 2005 Presidential Inauguration, marched in reviews for foreign dignitaries, and managed a team of Pentagon-funded software engineers developing management software for small units in the Army.
In the summer of 2005, Mullaney joined the faculty of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, as a history professor and Army Exchange Officer. He designed and taught an undergraduate course on the history of the U.S. Navy and American foreign policy. Mullaney left the Army in the summer of 2008 upon completion of his tour at the Naval Academy.
Public service.
Mullaney was on the national security staff of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, and served as the Chief of Staff of the United States Department of Defense Transition Team under co-chairs Michele Flournoy and Dr. John P. White. He worked as the Principal Director for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia for the Department of Defense from May 2009 to April 2010. In April 2010, he was appointed as a senior advisor on Afghanistan and Pakistan issues to the United States Agency for International Development.
Author.
Mullaney wrote "The Unforgiving Minute: A Soldier’s Education", an autobiographical look at preparing for the responsibility of leading men in combat and the hard-won lessons of that experience. In advance of its publication on February 19, 2009, it received critical praise from an array of leading political and military figures. Since publication it has received favorable reviews from publications including "The New York Times". "Times" reviewer Janet Maslin noted the "searing detail" of the Afghanistan combat description, and concluded that the memoir's "impact" comes from its account of "the inner journey of a man who is at first eager to learn as much as he can from service and scholarship. Later on he learns from his mistakes."

Geoffrey J. Neale is the former chair of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), the executive body of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He served two non-consecutive terms in that position. Neale's first term as LNC chair extended from 2002 to 2004. During the beginning of that first term he served for nine months unpaid in order to help the party financially. He served his second term from 2012 to 2014. 
In 2006 Neale was elected Treasurer of the Libertarian National Committee. In January 2007 he resigned that position and was replaced by Aaron Starr. Neale later stated that he had resigned as Treasurer because the committee had passed, over his objections, a budget that was unbalanced by $500,000.
The 2012 Libertarian National Convention, held May 2-6, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada, saw a two-day election of officers and members-at-large of the Libertarian National Committee officers leading to the defeat of most of the incumbents who were seen as being part of a "top-down faction". The voting for chair saw the first instance where "None of the Above", which was listed as a choice on the party ballot, received more votes than any of the candidates for chair. After a new list of individuals was nominated, Neale was elected chair.
At the 2014 Libertarian National Convention in Columbus, Ohio, Neale was defeated by Nicholas Sarwark in his bid for re-election as LNC chair.

UHTREX

The Ultra-High Temperature Reactor Experiment (UHTREX) was an experimental gas-cooled nuclear reactor run at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory between 1959 and 1971 as part of research into reducing the cost of nuclear power. Its purpose was to test and compare the advantages of using a simple fuel against the disadvantages of a contaminated cooling loop. It first achieved full power in 1969.
The experiment was a spin-off from the technology developed by the earlier ROVER project.
Reactor core design.
The UHTREX core was composed of a vertical hollow rotating cylinder (turret) constructed of solid graphite. The cylinder was 70 in. OD x 23 in. ID x 39 in. high. The core had 312 fuel channels. The channels were equally spaced radially around the core at 15 degree intervals arranged in 13 separate layers of 24 channels each. Each channel held up to 4 fuel elements and extended completely through to the inside of the cylinder. The core could be refueled remotely while at full power. Refueling involved rotating the core to the channel containing the element requiring replacement and pushing in a new element. The used element would be pushed out into the center and fall to the base of the reactor to be collected. At full power the reactor used up 1 to 6 fuel elements per day depending on enrichment and porosity of the fuel element. It produced 3MW of thermal energy.
Advantages.
A typical nuclear reactor prevents the coolant medium from directly contacting the fuel pellets either by cladding the fuel pellets, sealing the fuel pellets inside a fuel rod or running the coolant through separate piping. This prevents contamination of the cooling medium. One of the disadvantages of a sealed fuel assembly includes buildup of fission products inside the fuel element. Some of these products poison the reaction ultimately leading to poor efficiency well before a significant portion of the fuel is used up. At this time the reactor requires re-fueling. Keeping the fuel and coolant separate can present significant design challenges as well. For example the metal tubing required to do so cannot be operated at temperatures above its melting point which is generally significantly lower than the fuel pellet. This lowers the maximum theoretical thermal efficiency of the reactor.
The UHTREX used un-clad porous carbon extruded fuel elements each shaped like a long hollow cylinder. The fuel elements were manufactured by vacuum impregnating the porous carbon cylinders with aqueous uranyl nitrate solution then air drying and baking them in a furnace ultimately producing a uranium oxide coating tightly held in a porous graphite matrix. This fuel was expected to be substantially less expensive to manufacture than other types of fuel at the time. The primary advantages of this type of fuel was that the porosity of the pellet in addition to the high temperatures achievable would allow most of the poisons created by the fission products to migrate out of the fuel. The poisons would then be carried away by the coolant stream for eventual filtering out and removal. This allows a higher percentage of fuel to be burned up before the pellet needed replacement (up to 50%).
Disadvantages.
The major disadvantage to porous reactor fuel is that the entire primary cooling loop including all the pumps, compressors and heat exchangers would be become highly contaminated with fission products. Contamination caused by a potential contaminated coolant leak would pose a significant danger to personnel and the environment. The high contamination level precludes being able to open the reactor vessel for the eventual refueling. Therefore the reactor was designed for remote online refuelling.
Specifications.
UHTREX had following specifications:
where ID and OD are the inner and outer diameter, respectively.

List of Scott Pilgrim characters

This article is a list of fictional characters in the comic book series "Scott Pilgrim" and the film adaptation "Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World" by Bryan Lee O'Malley.
For the film versions of the characters, O'Malley sent crib sheets that explained backstory, character motivations, as well as events in the book to Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright. Bacall then created a "ten secret things" for each character, according to O'Malley, for fun, and many of the entries were jokes: O'Malley said that the "ten secret things" documents were not intended to be taken seriously as character background.
O'Malley created a height chart for the characters, printed in Volume 1 but said "it’s not really canon, and I never did one again, and the heights were always very inconsistent." With the exception of five of the characters, O'Malley said that the heights were "always kinda vague. I didn’t pay enough attention to it." O'Malley said that during the development of the book, "the hair colors in the book barely crossed my mind (I just used whatever color seemed nice at the time if I was coloring a cover or illustration). There were no “canon” hair colors in my mind."
Main characters.
Scott Pilgrim.
Scott William Pilgrim is the 23-year-old (24 in volumes 5-6) protagonist. He is the bass player for the band Sex Bob-Omb with his friends Stephen Stills and Kim Pine, He plays a Rickenbacker 4001c64, 4003 in the film. Though initially unemployed, he later gets a job as a dish washer and food prep trainee at The Happy Avocado vegetarian restaurant. The character's name was inspired by the song "Scott Pilgrim" from Plumtree's 1998 album "Predicts the Future". He believes that smoking is evil, drinks "only on occasions", and doesn't hit girls. Scott seems to suffer from memory problems, which his friends chalk up to his stupidity, though the memory problems began after his break-up with Envy Adams whom he dated through college. The series also references a "dark side" of Scott's personality which he avoids as much as possible. He is initially devastated by his break-up with Envy Adams and begins dating Knives Chau, before meeting Ramona. Ramona and Scott begin dating, but Scott is plagued by Ramona's elusive past and her "7 evil exes" led by the mysterious "Gideon", all of whom challenge him in succession for the right to date her. Despite his limited intelligence and poor memory capacity, Scott is often able to defeat his opponents through cunning rather than brute strength: in volume 2, he manages to goad Lucas Lee into performing a dangerous skateboarding trick and in the film adaptation, he successfully tricks Todd Ingram into consuming dairy products despite Todd's psychic powers. Scott is a surprisingly skilled fighter in unarmed combat and sword fighting. His hair is usually "messed up" after Ramona laughed at Scott when he had straight hair. He often dreams of stupid games until Ramona tells him to get a job.
Scott Pilgrim was ranked as the 85th greatest comic book character of all time by "Wizard" magazine. "Empire" magazine ranked Scott Pilgrim as the 40th greatest comic book character stating that Scott "is one of the most authentic twenty-somethings ever committed to comic book paper." IGN ranked Scott Pilgrim the 69th greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that they love Scott not just because he is a tried-and-true nerd who battles villains in epic fashion, but because he went through a dramatic character arc over the course of his series.
O'Malley said that Scott was not based on any one person, though referring to a friend he said "is is the only guy who has any claim to inspiration for Scott, and it’s purely visual — the personality is all fiction." O'Malley said that Scott is "a little taller than Ramona".
Scott is played by Michael Cera in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". Shortly before filming began, Cera received a list of secrets (some of which are already in the books, some of which are neither in the books nor the film) about the character. Cera said: "The one that really stays in my head is that Scott, in his mind, is the star of his own movie. This movie is, in a way, existing in his own mind. This is his weird perception of the world around him."
Cera also voices Scott for the animated short "Scott Pilgrim vs. The Animation".
Ramona Flowers.
Ramona Victoria "Rammy" Flowers is an American expatriate from New York, a "ninja delivery girl" for Amazon.ca and Scott's main love interest. Her age is unknown until the end of the 4th volume, where she reveals that she is 24 years old. She reveals very little and is very guarded about her past in New York before she moved to Toronto. She is capable of traveling through subspace and has seven evil exes who challenge Scott for her affection. She changes her hairstyle every three weeks and becomes anxious when Gideon is mentioned or brought up. Her head glows periodically, usually when she is upset or jealous, though she herself is unaware of this until Kim Pine brings attention to it in volume 5.
When asked if Ramona is supposed to be fat or plump, O'Malley responded by stating that "since it is a comic book and I draw everyone kinda cartoony and rounded, I figure it’s up to the reader to decide. However, I must inform you that Knives was mainly being mean when she said Ramona was fat." Her natural hair colour is not stated. O'Malley said "Nobody knows her natural hair color. Ramona may not even remember. She changes it a lot because she’s trying to figure out who she is / who she wants to be." On another occasion, when asked, O'Malley said "i don’t know… brown? How many natural hair colors are there really? she isn’t blonde. Honestly, i never thought about it… her hair color didn’t matter to me. because I was drawing a black & white comic. Her hair color is ‘whatever u desire~’" For the new colour editions of Volume 2 he kept Ramona's hair as purple, reserving the blue colour spectrum for Ramona's hair for Volume 4 and onwards. O'Malley said that if Ramona hypothetically broke up with Scott after Volume 6, she would change her hair to a chin-length, "messy" bob with bangs that is dyed black and chopped: O'Malley explained that he never used this hairstyle for Ramona because it is too similar to the shape of Kim Pine's hairstyle. In terms of Ramona's height, O'Malley said that it was "supposed to be tallish" meaning around or . Ramona's subspace bag, like her hair, changes colour periodically. Throughout her dating history, Ramona had one "non-evil" ex, Doug, who O'Malley named after one of his real life friends.
Ramona Flowers was ranked 70th in "Comics Buyer's Guide"s "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.
Ramona is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World".
Shortly before filming began, Winstead received the list of facts about Ramona's past. When asked what those facts are, she responded, "I honestly don't know if they are things that Bryan would want out there, so I'll keep them quiet. But things about her family-she's kind of a tragic figure in a way. She's been through a lot, and that's why she's so guarded and mysterious." Winstead has since revealed at least one of the secrets, one that she considered very insightful for her character: Ramona’s younger brother died when she was younger and she wears one of his shoelaces around her neck in memory of him. According to O'Malley, the particular detail about the brother is not applicable in the book version of Ramona. After Winstead learned she had the part, she began training to be the character in Los Angeles. The training included stunt training, pushups, kung fu training, as well as fight training. Winstead said that the training was "pretty cool" and "like being in some sort of kung fu camp."
Wallace Wells.
Wallace Wells (Rating 7.5/10) is Scott's "cool gay roommate". He is 25 years old and first met Scott in college, the circumstances in which they met are unknown - a flashback shows that both were drunk and headed to Wallace's. Wallace is more intelligent, responsible and mature than Scott: he holds down a job and pays for most of their expenses while they lived together as roommates. Most of their apartment's furniture and possessions belong to Wallace and he buys the majority of their groceries. Wallace serves as Scott's mentor during his trials, assisting Scott with training for his fights against Ramona's exes and gathering intel on them. He may have trained Scott in his fighting style, as Scott calls him a terrible master. He dates and later moves in with his "psychic" boyfriend, Mobile. The character was inspired by O'Malley's former roommate Christopher Butcher, the co-founder of PopImage and PreviewsReview.
O'Malley said that Wallace is "a little taller than Scott."
Wallace is played by Kieran Culkin in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World".
Knives Chau.
Knives Chau (Age 17) Chinese-Canadian high school girl and self-described "Scott-aholic". Scott dates her for a short while, but breaks up with her after he met Ramona (though he initially "forgets" to break up with her). Initially a quiet, typical school girl, after their break-up, she cuts and dyes her hair and changes her clothing style, hoping to win Scott back by becoming more of a hipster. Her discovery that Scott was cheating on her with Ramona causes tension between the two girls, sometimes culminating in actual fights, though later the two reach a level of acceptance of one another. She starts dating Sex Bob-omb's groupie Young Neil, although she is still in love with Scott. She and Young Neil later break up, but Knives still hangs out with the group. She initially idolizes Envy Adams, based on her success as a musician and her former relationship with Scott, but is soon disenchanted when Envy has her drummer Lynette Guycott punch Knives hard enough to knock the highlights out of her hair. Knives' father becomes aware of Scott's past relationship with his daughter, causing him to hunt him down and try to kill him, though Scott later earns his acceptance. Knives becomes aware of her father's plot when Scott tries to hide in the Second Cup, where Knives is newly employed. In Vol. 6, Knives turns 18 and goes off to university. Scott and Knives reconcile and remain friends.
Bryan Lee O'Malley used St. Michael's College School as the school Knives attends: in real life it is an all-boys school. In terms of her height, O'Malley described it as "short."
Knives is played by Ellen Wong in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". When an interviewer from "GQ" said "As a character, Knives can be a little bit...annoying," Wong responded, "Put yourself in her shoes! She's a capricious young girl. At that age, you don't know what you want or where you fit in in life." When the interviewer responded with "But she's obsessed with Scott Pilgrim. She's pathological," Wong responded with "I wouldn't say she's "obsessed". This is her first time being in love with somebody. She's feeling new emotions." Wong added that Knives begins as an "unblemished teenager" who was sheltered and discovers new aspects of life with Scott, and she adds that "then Scott breaks up with her and she’s forced to go back to her old life? No, she can’t go back now! No, not after she’s seen what exists out there, so she kind of fights for that and she wants to keep going, she’s just passionate, she’s determined, not annoying!"
Wong said that when she first auditioned for the role, she did not know who Knives was. She liked playing as Knives in that audition, so she bought the books and read them. Wong said that she "loved how free-spirited she was in the beginning phases -- she genuinely wants to have a good time. Then I got the books and found out she’s this bad ass ninja too it just kept getting better."
An interviewer told Wong that "More than anyone else in the film, Knives really goes on the most complex journey emotionally." Responding to that, Wong said that she enjoyed "figuring out her arc – showing her growth is definitely key to her story. It really is the story of a young girl figuring out where she fits in the world. A lot of the things she encounters in this movie have to do with it being “the first time” she’s dealt with it. I feel like the other characters have all gone through their Knives phase already – it’s kind of refreshing to see somebody young and untainted. She brings a fresh perspective to the movie." She added that she preferred the final cut ending versus the alternate ending where Knives and Scott become a couple, saying that it "adds to her character." Wong further explained, "But what’s great about both endings is that it remains unclear if Scott is in a dating relationship with Knives or Ramona. It's nice to leave that open because it’s like life. You don’t always get closure with concrete answers – anything can happen and you just have to move on."
As part of the film, Wong said that the "wire work" was "fun. It's like flying!" When the interviewer mentioned that he heard many complaints about the wires causing pain, Wong stated "It hurts more for the guys..."
Stephen Stills.
Stephen Stills is the lead singer, guitarist and "talent" of Sex Bob-omb. He is 23 years old and went to university with Scott. He is employed at The Happy Avocado vegetarian restaurant as a cook and later helps Scott get a job there as a dishwasher. Stephen is in a tumultuous relationship with Julie Powers, who at one point suspects that he and Knives may have a mutual attraction to one another. Whilst typically laconic, Stephen is known for rare fits of neurosis, typically over the quality—or lack thereof—of his band's music, as well as irritability, usually over Scott's absentmindedness. By the end of the series, Stephen reveals to Scott that he and Joseph are in a relationship and that he came out to the rest of their friends in Volume 5 after realizing that he is gay, causing Scott to ask "Julie turned you gay?". He claims that he did not tell Scott because he seemed to have a lot going on with his life. He shares a name with Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Scott always refers to him by his full name.
Stephen Stills is played by Mark Webber in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". Prior to this role, Webber had neither sung professionally nor played the guitar, but learned both in the weeks preceding filming. Bryan Lee O'Malley said that the film version of Stephen Stills is homosexual, as well as that he remains closeted throughout the movie. O'Malley said that he "maybe doesn't fully understand himself yet."
Kim Pine.
Kimberly "Kim" Pine is Scott's high school friend and drummer of Sex Bob-omb. She is 23 years old and was Scott's first girlfriend, whom he "saved" from Simon Lee. The two broke up when Scott's family moved away to Toronto. She has a sarcastic personality and dislikes many people. Kim is employed at No-Account Video throughout the series. Her relationship with Scott is typically one of annoyance at his ineptitude, but Volume 5 strongly hints that she is still in love with him, but has become resigned to the fact that he loves Ramona. She later moves back home to Northern Ontario at the end of Volume 5, prompting Scott to apologize ambiguously for his actions: she accepts the apology before boarding the bus. She later contacts Scott to have him relieve her of boredom at her parent's place. While he visits, Kim helps Scott remember the reality of his past relationships and accept that he did things as a bad boyfriend that he did not want to accept about himself. With Kim, it is revealed that he never told her he was moving away. She had to confront him after finding out from their mutual friend, Lisa Miller. During Scott's final fight with Gideon, she is psychically aware of the events taking place, despite being at her parents' home. She later forms another band with Scott. Bryan Lee O'Malley came up with the name "Kim Pine" when he was in high school, first used it for a character in the short-lived comic strip "Style" before using it for the Scott Pilgrim series. After viewing edits on TVTropes, O'Malley explained that Kim Pine is not necessarily less attractive than other characters, but that she believes she is less attractive than other characters and therefore "is insecure and/or uncomfortable with her looks". O'Malley explained that "Kim says Envy is pretty and looks bummed and clearly thinks Envy is prettier than her. But Envy is on the cover of a magazine, she’s a rock star, she’s wearing tons of makeup and she’s been professionally styled and photoshopped. Plus Scott dated her after Kim and it’s confusing. There’s more to it than “Envy is pretty! Kim is ugly so she’s sad!”"
In terms of Kim's height, O'Malley said that it was "medium".
Kim is played by Alison Pill in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World", Pill also voices Kim for the animated short "Scott Pilgrim vs. The Animation". Pill said that the film Kim "cares more about Sex Bob-omb than she lets on" and that she "cares more about Scott than she lets on." She added that Kim does feel some bitterness about the result of the romance between Scott and Ramona. Pill learned to play the drums for the role and performs on the soundtrack.
Young Neil.
Neil "Young Neil" Nordegraf is Sex Bob-omb's biggest fan. He is Stephen Stills' 20-year-old roommate/younger brother stated by Lynette Guycott in "The Infinite Sadness" and briefly dates Knives Chau, until she breaks up with him. Knives admits in volume 3 to only dating him because he looks so similar to Scott. In volume 5, he becomes angry at how isolated he has become from his friends and later becomes bitter and sullen, taking up smoking. He is the quietest character and is very apathetic to almost everything. He is described as "The young one, at least until Knives showed up". When called an ass, he says "I'm young, I'll grow out of it". In Volume 6, Scott introduces him for the first time as simply "Neil", which is described as the best day of his (Neil's) life. The inside cover of volume 5 calls him a "hanger on" and the author himself says that Young Neil is written as dopey because his eyes are covered by his hair. It was easier to write Neil as dopey than to portray him differently given his lack of eyebrows. His nickname is a reversal of Neil Young, a frequent collaborator of musician Stephen Stills.
In regards to his hair colour, when a Tumblr user asked Bryan Lee O'Malley why the character's hair colour was "light brown-nearly blond" in the colour section of "Scott Pilgrim Gets it Together" but in the new colour editions had a brown colour that is darker than Scott's colour, O'Malley replied saying that "the reason is that i don’t care what color young neil’s hair is lol who’s young neil even?"
His sister, Stephanie "Steph" Nordegraf played bongos and the viola in Scott's old band, Kid Chameleon.
Stephanie was a roommate of Stephen Stills while they attended university. After Stephanie moved out to pursue further education, Neil moved in and became a part of Stephen Stills's social circle. O'Malley said "That’s about as far as I thought it through. It was really just an explanation for why they’d have a younger friend, and this sister/roommate setup was based on an IRL ["in real life"] friend."
Young Neil is played by Johnny Simmons in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World".
Supporting characters.
Envy Adams.
Natalie V. "Envy" Adams is Scott's ex-girlfriend who devastates Scott by breaking up with him in college previous to the events of the book. Initially a quiet, mousey girl, she decides to change herself and her image, becoming more callous and aggressive, eventually taking over Scott's band and dumping him. She later reappears, introduced in the series as the lead singer and keyboardist for the popular emerging band "The Clash At Demonhead". Scott describes her original personality as being "nice" and does not understand what she has since become. Envy was in a relationship with Ramona's ex-boyfriend Todd Ingram and claims to know about Ramona's past. She later begins a relationship with Gideon, who helps promote her new solo album in Chaos Theatre. She tries to help Scott remember the real reason for why they broke up (an argument he started with her that night) and prepare for the fight with Gideon. Despite Gideon supporting her career, Envy is dissatisfied with his lack of true affection for her. Gideon later revealing he has no true interest in her. After his defeat, Envy reconciles with Scott.
O'Malley drew inspiration for Envy from several sources, including the "character" of Metric frontwoman Emily Haines as a performer. O'Malley used images of Haines as references for drawings of Envy in Volume 3. He stated that he did not entirely base Envy on Haines. He stated that he does not personally know Haines and is not aware of what her personality is like and so Envy's personality did not originate from Haines.
Envy is played by Brie Larson in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". In the film, Envy does not have a relationship with Gideon, she was originally intended to replace Ramona's fourth Evil-Ex, Roxie. In the film, Envy has blond hair instead of red hair. Edgar Wright originally read the volumes unbound, so he did not see the colour covers until later. He envisioned Envy being blonde. When discussing Envy with Bryan Lee O'Malley, he identified her as a blonde. O'Malley said that while he had coloured her hair red at one time, the character may have a good appearance with blonde hair. During initial costume tests, the red wig was applied, but O'Malley said "nobody was super into it." During the blond hair test, "obviously we all loved it." O'Malley said that therefore, "we all liked the platinum blonde better on Brie, so we went with that." O'Malley added that "Anyway, her hair in the movie is clearly bleach-blonde, so you can imagine for yourself that Envy was a redhead in college and dyed it for her big rock star makeover." For the coloured versions of the comic books, O'Malley continued giving Envy red hair because "Red on a cartoon character just has a completely different look and feel."
In a draft script, her middle name is "Veronica."
Stacey Pilgrim.
Stacey Pilgrim (Rated "T" for Teen) is Scott's 19-year-old younger sister, who is much more mature than Scott. She works at the same Second Cup as Julie Powers and is also friends with Ramona. She receives a fair amount of gossip from Wallace, though is generally annoyed at him for stealing away all of her boyfriends. Stacey is played by Anna Kendrick in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". Stacey is based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's sister, who has the name Stacey. When O'Malley was asked retrospectively which character he would remove if he could choose one, he said that it would be Stacey and he explained that he "kind of did remove her as the story went on… you’ll notice that she’s barely in the books at all after the first few volumes. I just felt weird about putting my sister out there in the world as the books got more popular. So anyway, I probably would have changed Scott’s sister’s name or something, if I was smarter. I’m dumb."
Julie Powers.
Julie Powers is Stephen Stills' 22-year-old ex-girlfriend. She attended the same college that Stephen and Scott did. She was roommates with Envy before Scott began dating her. Despite hating her in college, she tries (unsuccessfully) to get back in Envy's good graces once she has become famous. She was also friends with Ramona before she and Scott began dating. She tries to keep Scott away from Ramona, stating that she believes him to be a loser. Her character is described as "ass and obnoxious" and she frequently fights/argues with other characters, even befriending two of Ramona's evil exes as they attempt to fight Scott. At one point, she suspects that Stephen and Knives may have a mutual attraction, causing her to react toward Knives with hostility. During Volume 5 she begins holding regular themed parties at her loft apartment, with themes ranging from Halloween, "Underwater pimp and hoe, Canadian politics circa 1972 but you're secretly Batman", as well as a Day of the Dead party. Julie is played by Aubrey Plaza in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". Plaza received the list of ten secret facts about Julie the night before filming started. Plaza has since revealed at least two of the facts and has said that "some of them were weird" and "kind of silly": first, she is allergic to either cauliflower or penicillin depending on the interview, possibly both (she also implies in one of the interviews that the penicillin allergy may have been a plot point for a scene (or scenes) in the movie that ended up being cut out later). Second, as she put it, "…one of my secret facts was that Julie had a massive crush on Scott Pilgrim in college, and he never liked her. So that was helpful, 'cause I was like, "no wonder she hates him"." Plaza expands on this point in another interview, saying "...he had little flings and crushes on all of her friends but never really paid attention to her so that really bugs her." According to Bryan Lee O'Malley, Plaza had entirely created the plot point about Scott dating all of the other characters around Julie Powers and that the point was not created by anyone else.
Ramona's Evil Exes.
The League of Evil Exes was founded when Ramona left Gideon for Toronto. When he finds her six other exes online, he manipulates them into believing that Ramona was responsible for their break-ups. He uses their anger to mold them in the image of evil. They believe this to be a plan to get revenge on her, but Gideon's secret intention is to use Ramona's ability of subspace travel to manipulate the minds of everyone on Earth. The team was founded two weeks prior to the events of Vol. 1. Each time Scott defeats one of them they become (or drop) coins according to their place in the list in similar fashion to the enemies from the "River City Ransom" NES videogame from the 80s.
1. Matthew Patel is Ramona's first evil ex. According to Ramona, they only kissed once and broke up after about a week. Scott initially ignored Matthew's repeated challenges to fight him, leaving him confused when Patel arrived at the Rockit. He is Indian-Canadian, has mystical powers (flight and the ability to hurl fireballs) and can summon "Demon Hipster Chicks" at will. Scott gets $2.40 for defeating him. Matthew is played by Satya Bhabha in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World", in which his fight scene resembles a Bollywood musical number. His demons are portrayed by stage actress Christine Watson. In the film adaptation, Ramona mentions that she liked that he was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school.
2. Lucas Lee is Ramona's second evil ex, a pro skateboarder turned movie star (and a "sell out"). Scott gets $14 in coins and a mithril skateboard (that he cannot use since he lacks a skateboarding proficiency) after "defeating" him by tricking him into attempting a dangerous skateboard trick. He is named after pro skateboarder-turned-actor Jason Lee who Scott often mistakes him for. Lucas is played by Chris Evans in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World", where he battles Scott prior to his fatal skateboard trick using a gang of stunt doubles.
Chris Evans described Lucas as "a bit of a jerk, a little full of himself, not the best actor in the world."
3. Todd Ingram is Ramona's third evil ex, a bass player for the "Clash at Demonhead band". He has special "vegan-based" psychic powers (although he is secretly consuming non-vegan foods). He is arrogant, narcissistic, uncaring, also being a pathological liar. He dates Envy, his childhood love, but cheats on her repeatedly with Lynette, the band's drummer, as well as with other girls. He is caught by the Vegan Police for breaking his diet and has his powers taken away, giving the advantage to Scott. Scott gets some money (again in coins) plus an extra life when he defeats him. Todd is named after Scott Ingram, the real-life inspiration for the song "Scott Pilgrim". He is played by Brandon Routh in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World".
4. Roxanne "Roxie" Richter is Ramona's fourth evil ex and her former college roommate. She is a "half-ninja" (Kunoichi) and an accomplished fine artist, who taught Ramona much of what she knows of her ninja abilities and subspace. Scott is usually against fighting girls (or anyone with a sword), so Ramona fights Roxie, for part of the time using Scott's body as a weapon. Roxie has an inferiority complex over her "half-ninja" background, as well as her figure - she is much shorter than Ramona. Despite her status as an evil exe, Roxie gets on well with Ramona but openly hates Scott, claiming Scott is a "lazy ass" who refuses to fight his own battles, prompting Scott to finally mature in his relationship with Ramona, gaining a sword and "The Power of Love" (a reference to a Huey Lewis song). The final fight scene between her and Scott is a reference to the beginning of "Ninja Gaiden". When defeated by Scott, she explodes into a cascade of woodland creatures, a reference to "Sonic the Hedgehog". Roxie, spelled 'Roxy' in the film, is played by Mae Whitman, where she battles Ramona and Scott at a nightclub after-party (combining elements of Ramona and Envy's fight in Vol. 3 and the Winnifred Hailey fight in "Free Scott Pilgrim"). Scott barely defeats her by poking her "weak spot" on the back of her knee, causing her to explode into coins.
5.& 6. Kyle & Ken Katayanagi (Ken is referred to as "Kevin" in the video game) are Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, a pair of Japanese twins who often finish each other's sentences. The pair are "expert roboticists" who summon robots to fight Scott. They vowed to work together closely once the pair realized Ramona had been cheating on them with each other. The twins capture Kim Pine to lure Scott to them, pointing out in the meantime that Kim may still be in love with Scott. Scott defeats them and gets $79.95 for Ken, $74.95 for Kyle, as well as a $2 twins bonus (again all in coins) after defeating them both. He also unlocks an achievement for defeating them simultaneously (which is available in the video game). Kyle and Ken are played by Shota and Keita Saito respectively in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World", where they are instead DJs who engage Sex Bob-omb in a mystical amp battle during the semifinal round of the battle of the bands. They initially outclass Sex Bob-Omb by summoning "double dragon" animals from their amps, but are eventually defeated when Scott summons a Yeti by activating his distortion pedal.
In the video game Ken's name became Kevin in order to give a feel of a "looser" video game adaptation and to reference "Double Dragon 3" where "Billy" was mis-introduced as "Bimmy."
7. Gideon Gordon Graves is the 7th evil ex, the series' main antagonist and the leader of the League of Ramona's Evil Exes and suggested to be Ramona's boyfriend previous to Scott, in New York City. He is mentioned several times throughout the series, but never seen fully until the end of Volume 3. He is the owner of the "Chaos Theatre" (a reference to EarthBound), in NYC and "GGG Heavy Industries," which is opening "Chaos Theatre Toronto". Ramona has also "worked" for him previously in an unknown capacity, eventually he makes contact with Scott. There is also a small cat living at Ramona's house by the same name, though the cat is revealed to only be named as such by Ramona as a way of dealing with the breakup. Gideon finally appears in the last volume as an inventor and club entrepreneur who is opening a new club, the Chaos Theatre, in Toronto. He begins a relationship with Envy, promoting her new solo album and setting her debut up as his club's opening act. During this time, he meets up with Scott, who flees instead of fighting him, though their altercation is unavoidably inevitable. He has apparent control over subspace, a side effect of his ability to induce "emotional warfare" via The Glow, which essentially traps people in their minds with their psychological issues. Using this allows him to literally be inside Ramona's head. He is also able to steal Scott's Power of Love katana and proves to be a competent swordsman. Upon his defeat, he showers $7,777,777 (once more, in coins) over the Chaos Theatre. Gideon is played by Jason Schwartzman in the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World", who also controls Ramona's head through the use of microchips. One of the ten secrets for Gideon was that "Gideon is very passive aggressive and so he’s not overtly evil. He smiles a lot, just kind of 'kill ‘em with kindness,' but you can feel that it’s not sincere almost instantly." Schwartzman also stated that he really liked learning about this aspect of the character.

Taking Chance is a 2009 historical drama film based upon the experiences of Marine Lt. Colonel Michael Strobl (Kevin Bacon), who escorted the body of a fallen Marine, PFC Chance Phelps (posthumously promoted to LCpl), back to his hometown from the Iraq War.
The film was selected for showing at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and premiered on HBO on February 21, 2009.
Plot.
The film opens on a black screen, with white letters describing the date and place, as we hear radio chatter about a "suspicious vehicle" followed by the sound of an explosion and gunfire. We then cut to see two Marines driving, wearing dress blue uniforms, to an unmarked house in the middle of the night and knocking on the door. Finally we cut to Lt. Colonel Michael Strobl (played by Kevin Bacon) searching on his computer the casualty report for the Middle East. After a couple clips of Michael running through the woods, service members' coffins getting put into an airplane, and some driving. We find the Lt. Col. at work giving a presentation to several other Marines. Then the Lt. Col. makes his way home with his family for a short while, then the camera cuts to five Airmen in woodland MarPat camouflage taking US Flag draped coffins off of an airplane in the rain. After a short clip of the Lt. Col. eating dinner with his family, we find him looking at the casualty report yet again but this time he writes down some information. The movie then cuts to him in an interview with a higher ranking Marine and he asks to escort a Marine named PFC (Private First Class) Chance Phelps. He says it is because the PFC is from his hometown, then we see him discuss his choice with his wife. After he explains that he is doing this only because the PFC is from his hometown and has no other meaning, the film cuts to several people doing medical procedures on a dead body which one can assume to be PFC Phelps. After the morticians are shown, the film then cuts to the Lt. Col. leaving and telling his wife goodbye.
He then arrives at Dover Port Mortuary where he gets his instructions along with other Marines on how to go about escorting a fallen Marine. After the instruction, all the service member escorts who are awaiting their turn to depart head outside and render honors as each of them departs. The Lt. Col. then gets told that Phelps isn't ready to be transported yet due to the amount of casualties. He checks into a hotel room and the next day does an inventory, with another Marine, of Phelps' personal items including: a cross on a string, a Saint Christopher necklace, a wristwatch, and Phelps' dog tags. He is told that PFC Phelps's private effects are not to leave his side, under any circumstances. The Lt. Col. then verifies that the body in the van is in fact the PFC and then begins his drive to the airport where he has a talk with Rich Brewer (played by John Magaro) of the Dover Port Mortuary. They talk about the military and how the driver knew two men from his high school who enlisted, one of whom returned after sustaining severe injuries (who is recovering at Walter Reed), and the other who was killed. Lt. Col. Strobl arrives at the airport, where he first renders honors to the PFC as he is offloaded to a cargo area, before saying a curbside goodbye to the driver (telling him, he's "a good man"). Lt. Col. Strobl heads to the check-in counter, where the ticketing agent tells him that he has been upgraded to First Class. As he goes through security, he tells a somewhat annoyed TSA agent that he can't put Phelps' personal items into the x-ray scanner (because they are not allowed to leave his side at any time for any reason). He also says that he won't take off his Marine Dress Uniform Jacket to go through the metal detector because it would degrade the uniform. Eventually he is screened in private, with the TSA agent using a metal-detector wand, while the Lt. Col. holds on to the PFC's personal effects in his hand. He then renders honors to the PFC again as the coffin is loaded onto the airplane. On board, the man next to him in first class orders a Jack Daniels, and he orders a water, after which the man asks him "What, are you on duty?" He replies, "Yes, I am," and they take off. While in the air the flight attendant hands him a crucifix and tells him that she wants him to have it.
A few hours later, the plane touches down and Strobl and the PFC's casket wait to change flights in Minneapolis. After the casket is unloaded, Strobl requests to stay with the casket overnight in the airport's cargo area. Despite reservations from the foreman, his request is granted; one of the workers offers him a sleeping bag from his jeep. During this time, Strobl meets an Army sergeant of the 1st Cavalry division who he recognized from the Dover Port Mortuary. The sergeant tells Strobl that he is escorting his deceased brother home. The following morning, the PFC's casket is loaded onto a Northwest Airlines flight as the baggage handlers and even the flight captain pay their respects. On this flight, Lt. Col. Strobl sits next to a young woman who cheerily offers him a magazine to read, and also texts someone that she is sitting next to a "HOT soldier," which Lt. Col. Strobl happens to catch a glimpse of and corrects her that he is actually a Marine. Upon landing, the captain, a former A-10 pilot in the first Persian Gulf War, makes a special announcement, asking for the other passengers to remain seated so that Lt. Col. Strobl has a chance to deplane first and render honors for PFC Phelps as his casket is unloaded. The woman sitting next to the Lt. Col, who had no idea he was on an escort mission for a fallen Marine, is visibly touched, and apologizes for potentially being insensitive with her earlier actions; Lt. Col. Strobl instead warmly thanks her for her company.
After unloading, Lt. Col. Strobl is greeted by the funeral director, and they load PFC Phelp's casket for the final part of his journey. Along the way, an impromptu funeral procession forms along the highway, as people in passing cars see Lt. Col. Strobl and realize what the hearse is carrying. After arriving in the town where PFC Phelps's parents reside, the Lt. Col. is greeted by a younger fellow Marine, who along with a partner had driven up from Salt Lake City a few days earlier to inform PFC Phelps's family of his death. The men proceed into the funeral home, where the younger Marine suggests that this would be a good time to place some personal items that PFC Phelps's family had asked him to place into the casket; Lt. Col. Strobl agrees, and despite it being a closed casket ceremony, insists that he wants to make sure PFC Phelps's uniform is correct and in place. As the men open the casket, both Marines have a strong, emotional reaction to seeing PFC Phelps; Lt. Col. Strobl remarks that even though the staff at Dover Port Mortuary knew it was going to be a closed casket ceremony, they still made every effort to make sure that PFC Phelps was prepared and dressed perfectly.
Later that evening, a memorial event is held at the local VFW, to which Lt. Col. Strobl was invited earlier. The local veterans, along with PFC Phelps's sergeant (who was with him when he was killed) and others, all welcome Lt. Col. Strobl with sincere gratitude for "bringing Chance home." They reminisce about Chance's outgoing personality, and recount some war stories of his, including, eventually later in the evening, the sergeant's story of what happened the day that PFC Phelps was killed (apparently in the firefight following the IED attack on their convoy, heard at the beginning of the film, in which PFC Phelps was the gunner on a machine gun and was able to draw the focus of much of the enemy fire, allowing for his comrades to safely find cover for themselves). As the attendees of the memorial leave at the end of the evening, Lt. Col. Strobl remarks to the Korean War veteran who first introduced himself at the bar, that he could have been eligible for a tour of duty in Iraq himself, but instead "got used to the sight of his wife and kids" and put in an application for an office tour instead, which was granted. He feels somewhat ashamed of his actions, to which the Korean War veteran reminds him that there is no shame in loving his family, and that he is not any less of a Marine than PFC Phelps or his sergeant or any of the other men serving in combat in Iraq, because now, he is a witness for PFC Phelps, having served this escort mission, and he is now responsible in no small part for PFC Phelps's legacy.
Prior to the funeral the next day, Lt. Col. Strobl meets PFC Phelps's family for the first time, and makes a point of mentioning that PFC Phelps was treated with great care and dignity across his entire journey. He hands over PFC Phelps's personal effects, as well as a letter from PFC Phelps's platoon leader. He finally leaves them with the cross that was given to him by a flight attendant, saying that eventually he realized it wasn't really given to him, only that he was carrying it for them. With the father's voiceover reading the platoon leader's letter in the background, we see PFC Phelps's receive a funeral with full military honors, and his divorced parents are each presented with a flag, "on behalf of the President, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and a grateful nation," honoring their son. As the attendees all pay their respects, Lt. Col. Strobl renders one final salute as the last one left at the ceremony. The film ends as Lt. Col. Strobl reminisces about his experience, saying that despite the fact he didn't know PFC Chance Phelps prior to his death, somehow after escorting him home and laying him to rest, he now misses him. We then see Lt. Col. Strobl returning home and embracing his wife and children, as the final shot of the film reveals that the mailbox of the unknown house depicted at the beginning of the film says "Phelps."
Critical reception.
"Taking Chance" received generally favorable reviews, and currently holds a 76/100 rating on Metacritic. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a more mixed reception, with 50% of professional critics giving the film a positive review.
One review from "The Baltimore Sun", said that it "... is one of the most eloquent and socially conscious films the premium cable channel has ever presented," and "USA Today", said "A small, almost perfectly realized gem of a movie, "Taking Chance" is also precisely the kind of movie that TV should be making." On the other end is "Slant Magazine", saying "Instead of well-drawn characters or real human drama, we are presented with a military procedural on burial traditions. The film desperately wants the viewer to shed tears for its fallen hero without giving a single dramatic reason to do so."
The film was the most-watched HBO original in five years, with over two million viewers on the opening night, and more than 5.5 million on re-airings. Critics often attribute this success to its apolitical nature, not directly depicting nor offering an opinion of the Iraq War.
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote in his memoir 'Duty' that the film had an "important impact" on his decision to allow the media access to the transfer of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in February 2009.
Bacon received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie. The film received ten nominations for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Emmy for "Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or Movie".

Snake Tide (EP)

Snake Tide is You Am I's debut EP, released in May 1991. It is the last You Am I recording to feature original bassist Nik Tischler.
Background.
After signing with Sydney-based independent label Timberyard Records in 1990, You Am I recorded the tracks for their first EP during February 1991 with Phil Punch at Electric Avenue Studios. Guitarist and vocalist Tim Rogers was emerging as the group's primary songwriter, although he is now somewhat dismissive of his early output: "I knew I wasn't a good songwriter. It was all dynamics: soft bit, heavy bit, soft bit, heavy bit."
"Snake Tide" was released in May 1991, with the official launch held at the Lansdowne Hotel on 3 June.
Track listing.
All songs: Rogers/Tischler/Tunaley
Release history.
The original 12" vinyl EP was released in May 1991.
In May 1992 four of the tracks ("Drink It Dry, ", "New Face", "Conscience" and "Snake Tide") were issued on CD for the first time on You Am I's second EP, "Goddamn" (Timberyard SAW027CD). The same four tracks appear on the European release of "Goddamn", which was titled, somewhat confusingly, "Snake Tide" (Survival sur522cd).
In 2006 all tracks from the original "Snake Tide" EP appeared on the re-issue of "Goddamn" (Timberyard SAW522CD). This marked the first appearance on CD of the tracks "Inspiral" and "Home", although they have been taken from a vinyl source rather than the original master tape.
Alternative versions.
An alternative version of "Snake Tide" appears on the 7" vinyl EP "Self Mutilation Volume One" (Hippy Knight creep004), later re-issued on CD as "Self Mutilation: one, two, three, and more" (Hippy Knight CREEP 015). This recording pre-dates the version released on the "Snake Tide" EP.

Douschka Pickens

Francis Eugenia Olga Neva "Douschka" Pickens (later Dugas; March 14, 1859 – August 18, 1893) was the daughter of Francis Wilkinson Pickens, former Governor of South Carolina, and Lucy Holcombe Pickens. Born in Russia in 1859, rumor held that she was actually the daughter of Czar Alexander II.
Following the American Civil War, she was the dashing female leader in Edgefield County, South Carolina, in the Red Shirts movement. Douschka often wore a red cape and a red feathered plume in her hair. The Red Shirts blocked the polls to override the newly freed slaves votes in South Carolina to elect General Wade Hampton III in the 1876 governor election. She was nicknamed the "Joan of Arc of Carolina" for her leadership in the elections.
Biography.
Francis W. Pickens and his third wife, Lucy Holcombe, were married just prior to their departure for Russia following his appointment as Minister to the Russian Empire in 1858. The couple was popular among members of the imperial court and became intimate friends of the Russian czar and his wife. During their residence in Saint Petersburg, Lucy fell pregnant and soon gave birth to a daughter, Francis Eugenia, at the Winter Palace. The newborn daughter of the U.S. minister and his wife was christened with the names Olga and Neva, though she would come to be known as Douschka, a pet name meaning "little darling" in Russian said to have been given to her by the Empress Maria Alexandrova at her christening.
Douschka Pickens would marry Dr. George Couvier Dugas, a native of Augusta, Georgia. On December 18, 1884, she and Dugas gave birth to a son, Louis Alexander Dugas III. Douschka died in 1893 at the age of thirty-four after a sudden illness and is buried in Edgefield, South Carolina. Her son, Louis, would die nearly five years later on June 26, 1898, at the tender age of thirteen.

Literary Rejections On Display

Literary Rejections On Display is a website on which people can post and discuss rejection letters from magazines, agents and book publishers. The site was founded in 2007 and is run by a person calling him/herself "Writer, Rejected." "Entertainment Weekly" critic Michael Slezak described the site as for any writer "who's looking for a better way to deal with cruel dismissal than crying into a cup of herbal tea" or any bookworm "who wants to better understand the indignities your future favorite authors are suffering on their way to their seven-figure book deals..."
The website became the subject of a literary controversy in late 2008 when novelist Darin Strauss used it as a forum to respond to his critics. According to "The Village Voice", users of the website had launched slashing attacks on Strauss without having read any of his work, mocking his complaints, the "smirky" author photo, his theories about writing and literary history, and the "millions of dollars" that had supposedly been spent promoting him. Strauss responded on the website with an angry attack on his anonymous critics. The website has also criticized short story writer Scott Snyder and Virginia Quarterly Review editor Ted Genoways.
The website also awards a Golden Apple of Kindness award for members of the literary community who have demonstrated "niceness"; previous winners include Rosemary Ahern, the former director of Washington Square Press, and short story writer Jacob M. Appel.

<doc id="21456665" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21456665" title="Vine Brook">
Vine Brook

Vine Brook is a brook in Middlesex County, USA. According to the History of Bedford, Vine Brook is "an important tributary of Shawsheen River." The book also states it as an excellent source of water-power in the 17th to 19th Centuries.
Vine Brook flows from the "Old Reservoir," at a public park off Marrett Road in Lexington, then meets Upper Vine Brook (one of its tributaries), then continues northward through Lexington Centre, through Butterfield's Pond on the Lexington-Burlington border, underneath the Middlesex Mall and Burlington Mall (in a culvert), remaining northward and parallel to the Middlesex Turnpike for a ways, then meets Long Meadow Brook (one of its tributaries), then part of it branches off to form Sandy Brook, then continues to flow northwesterly over the Burlington-Bedford border, to Route 3 at Burlington Road, then crosses over Rte. 3 to an old millpond, and empties into the Shawsheen River. (The Shawsheen, in turn, empties into the Merrimack River, which then empties into the Atlantic Ocean.)
Vine Brook is one of the best-known water features in Lexington, and is closely identified with the histories of Lexington and Burlington, due to the several mills which once operated on its banks. The brook lends its name to many local streets and developments. Several segments of the brook, in all three towns it passes through, are parts of town-owned conservation land parks.
Tributaries.
Vine Brook has two major tributaries.
Branches.
Vine Brook has one secondary branch.
General History.
Before the first white settlers came around the 1630s, the Indians had formed no permanent settlement near Vine Brook in Lexington, as the water supply was not great enough for an entire tribe. However, towards the Shawsheen River there were settlements, as that was certainly a greater body of water. (While Vine Brook was small in those days, though, it did have fish.)
When the first settlement was made at Lexington circa 1642, it was near Vine Brook.
As can be seen in the next section, there was a great use of the Brook for mills, from the 17th to 19th Centuries.
In the early 20th Century, however, the practical use of the Brook switched to irrigation for neighboring farms, as Lexington was still very much a farming community up to around the 1950s. In the 1930s, as part of a WPA project, the Brook was widened and deepened from its original shallow, narrow bed from Hayes Lane to Emerson Road, all in Lexington. This was to better use it for irrigation purposes. (Today, much of the brook bed is reverting to its natural size, gradually filling back in with silt.) In addition, it was culverted from Hayes Lane back upstream to Vine Brook Road in Lexington.
Today, a great deal of the Brook is on town-owned conservation land parks. Though many sections of the Brook have had their appearance altered over the years, some areas still remain relatively as they were in the Colonial days and before.
Mills.
There have been several mills on Vine Brook over the centuries, and it is this industry that has so connected the brook to the towns it passes through. According to the History of Bedford, at the time it was written, "the only motive-powers, utilized that time in Bedford are on the Shawshine River and Vine Brook." According to the Bedford town website, when Bedford was being incorporated as a separate town from Billerica, there was negotiations as to which town would retain rights to the Vine Brook area, due to its valuable water-power. Following are known mills listed in downstream order, with locations, and dates if known:
Conservation lands.
Many stretches of Vine Brook are owned by their respective towns, as conservation land. This body of water is vital to the wildlife of its respective towns; The Bedford town website notes that the old millpond at Vine Brook and Route 3 "is one of the few open bodies of water in Bedford and supplements an important wildlife habitat corridor along Route 3 which supports a diverse wildlife population." Following is a list of conservation areas that include sections of the Brook.
Etymology and spelling.
In 1636 is the first deed reference to land that is now Lexington. It granted of upland and meadow to a Mr. Harlackenden of Cambridge, at "Vynebrooke."
Vine Brook probably took its name from grape vines growing by its banks. John Josselyn (in his "New England's Rarities") and other writers from the 17th Century (such as William Wood in his "New England's Prospect") noted the abundance of grape vines, primarily in low, wet areas.
The type of grape that probably grew at Vine Brook was Vitis labrusca, or "Fox Grape." These same 17th Century authors noted the great size of these grapes (nearly four inches around in some cases), and enjoyed the sweet flavor. There are still a few grape vines which grow at the Brook's bank in Lexington today, on conservation land.
It is quite probable that there was an ancient Indian name for this brook, though it is not known. The Nipmuck Indians were frequent passers-through in the Vine Brook area, though they had no permanent settlement there. A loose translation of "Vine Brook" into Natick Algonquin would be "Wenonis Seep," literally grapevine river.
Flooding.
The Brook would frequently flood Waltham Street, Lexington, in the Colonial days. The residents of the Southwest part of town would complain that they could not get to "meeting," or church.
March 14 and 15, 2010, has seen the only major flood in recent years. North Street in Lexington was nearly submerged, and Vine Brook's swelling contributed to major flooding on the Shawsheen River.

Empress Eishō

Early life.
As the daughter of Kujō Hisatada, who was a former "kampaku," Kujō Asako could anticipate a life unfolding entirely within the ambit of the Imperial court; but she could not have anticipate the vast array of changes which the years would bring during her lifetime. At age 13, she was matched with Crown Prince Okihito. When Emperor Ninkō died in 1846, the newly elevated Emperor Kōmei named her "Nyōgo," a consort position of high honor to which princesses of the blood were appointed after the time of Emperor Kammu.
Consort.
Asako had two daughters, whom both died in infancy; but she became the official mother of Komei's heir, Crown Prince Mutsuhito. He developed a strong emotional attachment to her, which became especially important in the unsettled period after Emperor Kōmei died unexpectedly.
Empress dowager.
Soon after the death of Emperor Kōmei, Emperor Meiji conferred the title of Empress Dowager; and she was given a posthumous name to go with her new title. This was a highly unusual gesture; and she was afterward known as . This specific posthumous name was taken from the title of a poem, "Purple Wisteria over a Deep Pool," by a T'ang dynasty poet; and it was deemed appropriate for a daughter of the Kūjo family as part of the Fujiwara ("Wisteria Field") clan. 
When the Meiji period Imperial court relocated from Kyoto to Tokyo, she followed, living first in the Akasaka Palace and then in the Aoyama Palace.
The empress dowager died in 1897 at age 62 and was buried at Senyū-ji, which is in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Her memory is officially honored at her husband's mausoleum in Kyoto, which is known as "Nochi-no-tsukinowa no higashiyama no misasagi."
Franz Eckert composed ""Trauermarsch"" ("Deep mourning" funeral march or ""Kanashimi no kiwami"") for the funeral of Empress Dowager Eishō.
Emperor Meiji and his wife could not attend the funeral, but they traveled to Kyoto to pay graveside respects in the spring after her death.

Carlin Romano

Carlin Romano is an American writer and educator. He was cited for "bringing new vitality to the classic essay across a formidable array of topics," as a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize in criticism.
Career.
Romano is a critic-at-large for the "The Chronicle of Higher Education." He was a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer for many years. He teaches at Ursinus College and the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. He previously taught philosophy at Bennington College.
In 1981, Romano reviewed books about philosophers for "The Village Voice Literary Supplement". His writing has appeared in "The Wall Street Journal", "The Nation", The Weekly Standard, Times Literary Supplement, The New Yorker, and elsewhere.
Romano contributed an article on Umberto Eco to Oxford University Press's "Encyclopedia of Aesthetics". In 1993, Romano wrote an essay for "Danto and His Critics" entitled, "Looking Beyond the Visible: The Case of Arthur C. Dantwo," about art critic Arthur Danto. In his essay, Romano sets up a dichotomy between "pragmatism" and "Hegelianism" and finds statements in Danto's books that he claims fit into one of these two schools of thought. "The Institution of Philosophy: A Discipline in Crisis?" (published 1989 by Open Court, edited by Avner Cohen and Marcelo Dascal), includes a proposal by Romano to set up a World Court of Philosophy in which appointed philosophers would stipulate philosophical conclusions.
He wrote "America the Philosophical", a book with the main claim that the current United States has the "most philosophical culture in the history of the world."
In 2013 he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship.
Life.
Romano was born in Brooklyn, New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Princeton University. He took an M.Phil. in philosophy from Yale University and a J.D. from Columbia University. One of the Fulbright Scholars in 2002, he lectured at Smolny State University, St. Petersburg. He was a Joan Shorenstein Center fellow in 1993. and a NAJP(National Arts Journalism Program) Fellow at Columbia University in 1998. In 1989 Romano received an Eisenhower Fellowship; in his case to travel to Israel. He is an ongoing elected Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University.
Controversial critiques.
Martin Heidegger.
In the 18 October 2009 issue of "The Chronicle" in "Heil Heidegger!", citing Heidegger's well-known past Nazi affiliations, Romano was highly critical of Martin Heidegger's work and its continued acceptance amongst American academics and intellectuals. The article was a review of the publication in English of French philosopher Emmanuel Faye’s "Heidegger: The Introduction of Nazism into Philosophy in Light of the Unpublished Seminars of 1933-1935" (first published in 2005, in France), highly critical of Heidegger for the same reason. Romano called on librarians to stop stocking the collected works of the German philosopher, which appear under the term "Heidegger Gesamtausgabe". This controversial article renewed public dialogue about the relation between a person's politics and the merit of their work.
Catharine MacKinnon.
The publication of "the most controversial by far" "Only Words" book review, written by Romano, provoked a strong reaction with his imagined description of himself raping the author, Catharine MacKinnon.
This performative counterexample to MacKinnon's apparent contention that a rape in words is equivalent to a rape in deeds intensified the debate about legal sanctions against pornography. Romano said in defense of this review, "The worst thing that can happen to a flamboyant claim is to be tested by a good example." 
Philip Roth.
In a 2007 book review of Philip Roth's "Exit Ghost", Romano revived the long-standing controversy over the extent that Roth's fiction is autobiographical. He used Claire Bloom's 1996 memoir "Leaving a Doll's House" as proof that Roth's books are "more autobiographical than imaginative."

ASEAN Basketball League

The ASEAN Basketball League, often abbreviated to the ABL, is a men's professional basketball league in Southeast Asia. Six clubs from six different countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) competed in the league's 2009 inaugural season. The league was proposed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and launched on October 1, 2009.
History.
Formation.
Basketball luminaries from 6 ASEAN nations gathered at the Renaissance Hotel, Makati City in Metro Manila, the Philippines on September 1, 2009 to officially begin a new era of Southeast Asian basketball. In addition to the local basketball leagues in their respective countries, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have all contributed to setting up a diverse basketball league with passionate country-to-country rivalries.
Teams that participated in the inaugural season were the Brunei Barracudas, Kuala Lumpur Dragons, Philippine Patriots, SM BritAma, Thailand Tigers and former National Basketball League team, the Singapore Slingers. Mirroring the Euroleague in the west, the ABL has its own set of rules in terms of its roster makeup and salary caps. Teams are permitted two imports of non-ASEAN citizenship, three ASEAN imports, one player with one Southeast Asian parent, and seven local players. Teams are allowed to field a team of all local players if they wish to do so.
In July 2012, the league announced that Kuhan Foo, CEO since the ABL's inception, was moving on to a position leading additional regional sports properties. In his place, the league named Anthony Macri as the next CEO, and he will lead the ABL into Season 4, set to begin in early 2013.
The League also revealed a major change in November 2012 when a new ABL logo was unveiled for the 2013 season. The new logo is a shield and predominantly red and orange, although the ABL's signature basketball is still incorporated as a main feature of the design.
“Although the ABL’s ball and net has successfully identified the league with the sport across the region, we felt that we now needed to update the league’s brand to reinforce the league’s ASEAN identity,” said Mr. Anthony Macri, Chief Executive Officer of the ASEAN Basketball League. “So we’ve integrated the full name of the league into the logo and made the letters ASEAN more prominent.”
On February 21,2014, ABL announced that CEO Anthony Macri is leaving the league after two years, citing family reasons. In a statement, "I thankful to our owners, my colleagues, the players, and most of all, our fans for their support for the last two years.", "This was a very difficult decision as my time with the ABL has been extremely fulfilling for me personally and professionally. This decision is entirely about my family." Macri finished,"I will always have a special place in my heart for the ABL and wish the league nothing but continued success."
League expansion.
In the ABL Internship Program Press Conference held on March 11, 2011, ABL CEO Kuhan Foo reported that 3 teams are on talks for a possible entry as expansion teams, 2 of them are from the Philippines, one of them is San Miguel Corporation and another a Cebu-based company, the other is from Jakarta, Indonesia.
On July 6, 2011, the well-known PBA team, the San Miguel Beermen will bring their winning tradition to the ABL, when they joined the league in a signing ceremony at the San Miguel Corporation office in Mandaluyong. Bobby Parks has been named as the team's head coach. This will be a different team from the original PBA team that is currently named as the Petron Blaze Boosters.
On August 5, 2011, Bangkok Basketball Holdings joined ABL in a signing ceremony at Golden Tulip Sovereign Hotel, the team is owned by Tom Griffin and Jeffrey Premer. The team will be known as the Bangkok Cobras for the upcoming season.
On September 22, 2011, the Brunei Barracudas has announced that they had bow out of the third season of ABL after participating for 2 seasons. This was stated by Barracudas owner Nadzaty Azma Azeez. No reason was announced on their pull-out.
On October 20, 2011, the Saigon Sports Academy officially announced the participation of Saigon Heat into the third season of ABL, making them the first ever international professional basketball team to represent Vietnam.
League format.
ABL announced that the tentative start of Season 3 is on January 2012, this is due to FIBA Asia's calendar of tournaments for 2011 (FIBA Asia Championship 2011 and 2011 Southeast Asian Games). From then on, ABL will start in January and ends in June coinciding with FIBA calendar of tournaments. Prior to the 2012, the season started on October and ended on February.
The league is held via a triple home and away format where each team faces each other 3 times per regular season; as such the number of total games per regular season varies depending on the number of participating teams in that year. At the end of the regular season, the four teams with the best records qualifies for the playoffs. In the best-of-three semifinals, the top 2 seeds will have the home court advantage against the lower seeds and will host the first and third (if necessary) games. In the first season, the finals was a best-of-five series, with the higher seed hosting the first two and the fifth (if necessary) games. The Finals format was changed to a best of three series for the second and third seasons, where the higher-ranked team earns home-court advantage and hosts the first and third (if necessary) games. For the fourth season, it will be a quadruple home and away format where each team faces each other 4 times with the semis,a best-of-five, and the finals, a best-of-five series.
The champions are supposed to represent the Southeast Asia Basketball Association (SEABA) in the FIBA Asia Champions Cup. However, since the tournament only limits one club per country, the 2010 champions Philippine Patriots were disallowed from participating since the Smart Gilas Philippine team had already qualified. In 2011, the Chang Thailand Slammers were supposed to represent SEABA but the Thailand federation was then suspended by FIBA; this caused the Westports KL Dragons to represent SEABA, as the runner-up Patriots' slot was already taken by Smart Gilas.
Champions.
The finals was a best-of-5 (2–2–1) series in 2010 and again in 2013,it became best-of-3 (1–1–1) series from 2011-12.
