International Association of Classification Societies

The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) is a technically based organization consisting of thirteen marine classification societies headquartered in London.
Marine classification is a system for promoting the safety of life, property and the environment primarily through the establishment and verification of compliance with technical and engineering standards for the design, construction and life-cycle maintenance of ships, offshore units and other marine-related facilities. These standards are contained in rules established by each Society. IACS provides a forum within which the member societies can discuss, research and adopt technical criteria that enhance maritime safety.
History.
IACS was founded on September 11, 1968, in Hamburg, Germany. As of September 2011, its members are the thirteen largest marine classification societies in the world. More than 90% of the world's cargo carrying ships’ tonnage is covered by the classification standards set by the thirteen member societies of IACS. (Source: IACS Website)
IACS can trace its origins back to the International Load Line Convention of 1930 and its recommendations. The convention recommended collaboration between classification societies to secure "as much uniformity as possible in the application of the standards of strength upon which freeboard is based...".
Following the Convention, Registro Italiano Navale (RINA) hosted the first conference of major societies in 1939 - attended by ABS, BV, DNV, GL, LR and NK - which agreed on further cooperation between the societies.
A second major class society conference, held in 1955, led to the creation of working parties on specific topics and, in 1968, to the formation of IACS by seven leading societies. In 1969, IACS was given consultative status by the IMO. Its membership has increased since that time to the current thirteen members.
Purpose.
Although IACS is a non-governmental organization, it also plays a role within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), for which IACS provides technical support and guidance and develops unified interpretations of the international statutory regulations developed by the member states of the IMO. Once adopted, these interpretations are applied by each IACS member society, when certifying compliance with the statutory regulations on behalf of authorizing flag States.
IACS has consultative status with the IMO, and remains the only non-governmental organization with observer status which also develops and applies technical rules that are reflective of the aims embodied within IMO conventions. The link between the international maritime regulations, developed by the IMO and the classification rule requirements for a ship’s hull structure and essential engineering systems is codified in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).
Organization.
IACS is governed by a Council, with each Member represented on the Council by a senior management executive. The position of Chairman of the Council is rotated between the members on an annual basis. Reporting to the Council is the General Policy Group (GPG), made up of a senior management representative from each member society. The GPG develops and implements actions giving effect to the policies, directions and long term plans of the Council. The chair of GPG is taken by the Member holding the Council chair. Much of the technical development work of IACS is undertaken by a number of working parties (WP), the members of which are drawn from the technical, engineering, survey or quality management staff of the member societies.
Duty and responsibility for membership.
More than 50 organizations worldwide define their activities as providing marine classification. Any classification society that meets the conditions of membership may apply for membership within IACS. To remain a member of IACS, all members are required to demonstrate continued compliance with quality standards as determined by periodic audits.
To promoting maritime safety and clean seas, IACS and its individuals carry out research and development on marine-related topics, providing technical support and verifying compliance with published standards.
The classification process begins with the evaluation by the class society of a submitted design to determine its compliance with the rules. During construction, classification society surveyors attend the vessel to verify that it is built in conformance with the drawings and to the rules. On delivery, the vessel will receive periodic surveys by the society to verify that it is being maintained to the required standard. These surveys generally follow a five-year cycle of annual, intermediate and special surveys with the extent of the survey varying depending upon the age of the vessel or offshore unit and the type of survey being conducted.
For a vessel to remain ‘in class’ it must meet the class rule requirements at the completion of each survey. Should a vessel sustain in-service damage, the vessel’s owner advises the classification society of record so that a damage survey can be arranged. If the surveyor decides that the damaged vessel no longer meets the rules, the owner must carry out repairs to bring the vessel back into compliance if it is to remain in class.
Withdrawal of services.
In November 2012, following action by the China Classification Society (CCS), all members of IACS had ended Iran-related certification work. A targeted campaign by United Against Nuclear Iran led CCS and other IACS classification societies to exit Iran. Without certification from IACS firms, vessels are largely unable to secure insurance cover or call at international ports.

Armstead, Montana

Armstead is a former community in Beaverhead County, Montana, United States, about south of the county seat of Dillon. It was named after miner Harry Armstead. Armstead was located in a narrow valley of the Beaverhead River, near the mouth of Horse Prairie Creek. The town was a station stop on the Union Pacific Railroad line from Idaho Falls, Idaho to Butte, Montana. There was a post office in Armstead from 1907 to 1962.
Armstead is perhaps best remembered as the eastern terminus and headquarters of the Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad, which operated a line from there to Salmon, Idaho between 1910 and 1939.
The Lewis and Clark expedition traveled past the future location of Armstead during its westward trek in 1805.
The construction of Clark Canyon Dam in 1961–1964 created a reservoir that completely inundated the former site of Armstead. The town was still a viable community when the decision to build the dam was made. Because of this, some people do not categorize Armstead as being a ghost town. When the water level is low enough parts of the old highway, railroad, and even some building foundations are still visible.

Silent lotus

silent lotus is a spiritual advisor with an additional gift of sharing through poetry and art.
Descending from grandparents who traveled from homes in Hungary and Russia, silent lotus was born in America. He was raised in the small unique community of Roosevelt, New Jersey, which was designed in the Bauhaus style by Louis Kahn and Alfred Kastner in 1936 and was the home to many renowned people in the arts including Ben Shahn, Bernarda Bryson Shahn, Jacob Landau, Gregory Prestopino and Benjamin Appel. During 1970-71 he helped to organize college charity benefits in Boston that were in part performed by his classmate, performance artist/comedian, Andy Kaufman. In his mid-twenties he left for the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean to give priority to his talents as a visual artist.
Almost two years later, as crew of a 30-meter sailboat, along with film producer Saul Zaentz, he ventured across the Atlantic Ocean. From the Mediterranean he traveled overland through Europe and settled in the city of Rotterdam. He began a unique friendship with the elderly Willem Sandberg. Shortly thereafter his work was purchased by the Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art in Amsterdam for the permanent collection. One of his earliest lithographs was commissioned by the art editor of the NRC Handelsblad and the entire edition was sold out in less than a week.
In 1995 he was chosen to represent The Netherlands in the Art Accra exhibition held in Accra, Ghana. His video about his art work TOBARI was shown on Ghana's National Television and he was also interviewed by Lana Wong for BBC Television.
He was interviewed in 2004 about his poetry by Louise Hutner, editor of Sacred Journey

USS Jaguar (IX-120)

USS "Jaguar" (IX-120), an "Armadillo"-class tanker designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the jaguar, a large leopard-like mammal of wooded regions, typically yellowish brown marked with dark spots. Her keel was laid down as "Charles T. Yerkes" under Maritime Commission contract (Z-ET1-S-C3) by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, in San Pedro, California. She was launched on 20 November 1943, renamed "Jaguar" 27 October, acquired by the Navy 15 December 1943 and commissioned that day with Lieutenant Commander T. E. Hammond in command.
After shakedown out of San Pedro, California, "Jaguar" departed 19 January 1944 for duty as a floating storage ship in the Pacific islands. She arrived New Caledonia on 21 February via Wellington, New Zealand, and from there she transported vital diesel oil, aviation gasoline, and minesweeping gear to the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands. "Jaguar" returned to the West Coast early in 1946 and arrived Norfolk, Virginia, via the Panama Canal on 20 April. She decommissioned there 10 June 1946, and was turned over to the Maritime Commission. After serving as a tanker with various American lines under the name of "Harry Peer" in 1948 and "Tini" in 1949, the ship was transferred to Panamanian flag in February 1951.

USS Mink (IX-123)

USS "Mink" (IX-123), an "Armadillo"-class tanker designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the mink, a mammal found in the cooler latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, valued for its lustrous fur. Her keel was laid down as "Judah Touro" 20 October 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract (T. Z.ET1.S.C3) by Delta S. B. Shipbuilding Company, New Orleans, Louisiana. She was launched on 4 December 1943 sponsored by Mrs. E. S. Lazarus, renamed "Mink" 27 October 1943, acquired by the Navy 8 January 1944, and commissioned on 9 January 1944 with Lieutenant W. J. Meagher in command.
After shakedown off Texas, "Mink" arrived Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 2 February 1944. She then sailed to Milne Bay, New Guinea, with a cargo of diesel oil and motor gasoline, arriving 12 March to strengthen the service force of the Seventh Fleet. After unloading cargo and fuel along the coast of New Guinea, she joined a convoy which anchored in Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, on 30 May. "Mink" spent the next two months discharging cargoes, of aviation gasoline, diesel, and lubricating oil to many ships and craft during the buildup for the invasion of the Philippines.
She arrived in Leyte Gulf, Philippines, on 24 October from Hollandia, New Guinea. "Mink"’s gunners shot down two Japanese planes during the Battle for Leyte Gulf.
"Mink" steamed with a convoy to Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, reaching her destination 13 January 1945. There Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid and the Seventh Fleet landed United States Army troops in an amphibious operation which contributed greatly to the success of the Luzon campaign. For the next four months, "Mink" steamed off Morotai, refueling ships, and during the final month of the war, she ranged from Luzon to Mindanao, refueling craft.
Following the Japanese surrender, she sailed under the command of Lt. Harold C. "Brownie" Brown to Newport News, Virginia, arriving 16 May 1946. "Mink" decommissioned on 26 June and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 27 June. On 19 July she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Renamed "Judah Touro", she was subsequently sold into merchant service, and later carried the names "Seavalor", "Apukia", and "Eleni V".
"Mink" received three battle stars for World War II service.
A black and white photograph of the ship during its launching exists. It is in a historical display on the first floor
of Touro Infirmary in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Marathon Classic

The Marathon Classic, in full the Marathon Classic Presented by Owens Corning and O-I, is a women's professional golf tournament on the LPGA Tour. It was founded in 1984 and has been played yearly, except in 1986 and 2011, in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb northwest of Toledo.
History.
The tournament was founded after PGA Tour caddie Judd Silverman, a Toledo native, sought to bring a ladies professional golf tournament to his hometown. He contacted sponsors and actor Jamie Farr, also a Toledo native, brought his name and several of his celebrity friends to the tournament. Throughout the history of the event, children's charities in Northwest Ohio and Southern Michigan have been the charitable beneficiaries of the tournament. They have received more than $6.2 million during the event's history.
From 2004 to 2010, the title sponsor was Owens Corning, the world's largest manufacturer of fiberglass and related products, headquartered in Toledo, near the site of the tournament. In 2012, they became a presenting sponsor. Kroger, one of the largest American supermarket chains, with headquarters in Cincinnati, has also been involved as a sponsor of the tournament since 1997. Owens-Illinois (O-I) will begin being a sponsor during the 2012 tournament.
From 1984 to 1988 the tournament was held in the village of Holland at the Glengarry Country Club, which became Stone Oak Country Club in 1988. The event moved several miles north to the Highland Meadows Golf Club in Sylvania in 1989, where it is currently played.
The largest playoff in LPGA history took place at the 1999 Jamie Farr, a six-player affair involving Karrie Webb, Carin Koch, Sherri Steinhauer, Se Ri Pak, Kelli Kuehne, and Mardi Lunn. Pak won it on first hole of sudden death by making a ten-foot birdie putt.
In 2007, Se Ri Pak won the Farr for the fifth time, becoming only the fourth LPGA golfer to win the same tournament on five different occasions.
The tournament was at risk of ending after 2009, due to a variety of circumstances including the slumping worldwide economy and reported dissatisfaction with LPGA Commissioner Carolyn Bivens. Late in August 2009, after Bivens had resigned under pressure, it was announced that the tournament would continue for at least one more year, albeit with a sharply reduced purse.
On June 29, 2010, LPGA Commissioner Michael Whan announced the Farr Classic would return for at least three more years beginning in 2012. The tournament took a one-year hiatus in 2011, as the Toledo area will host the U.S. Senior Open, a major championship on the Champions Tour, at the Inverness Club.
On December 2, 2011, tournament director Judd Silverman announced that the Jamie Farr Classic would have a new name and a new logo. The tournament would be known as the "Jamie Farr Toledo Classic Presented by Kroger, Owens Corning and O-I". On January 8, 2013 the LPGA announced that Marathon Petroleum was replacing Jamie Farr as the title sponsor.

Malcolm Musgrove

Malcolm Musgrove (8 July 1933 − 14 September 2007) was an English football player and manager.
Musgrove played for his local side, Lynemouth Colliery, before being called up for national service, which he served in the Royal Air Force. He played for a Forces team and also for Scottish junior side Sunnybank while in the RAF and joined West Ham United in December 1953.
At West Ham, he soon established himself as a left-winger, making his league debut in 1954 against Brentford. He went on to make 301 league and cup appearances for the Hammers before joining Leyton Orient as player-coach in December 1962. He became chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1962 and remained in the post until his retirement as a player in 1966. 
He left Orient in 1965 to coach Charlton Athletic under Bob Stokoe, from where he moved to Aston Villa in 1967. In late 1968, he joined Leicester City as assistant manager under former West Ham team-mate Frank O'Farrell, taking them back to the top flight when they won the Division 2 Championship in 1970–71. When O'Farrell moved to Manchester United in June 1971, Musgrove followed, again taking an assistant manager's position. O'Farrell and Musgrove were both sacked by Manchester United in December 1972, after a disastrous 5-0 loss at Crystal Palace. In January 1973, Musgrove took the manager's job at Torquay United, a post that O'Farrell had held himself five years earlier.
He had little success at Torquay, with a highest league finish of 9th place in 1975–76 in his time at Plainmoor. He left Torquay in November 1976, to be replaced by O'Farrell, and the following year coached NASL side Connecticut Bicentennials. In 1978, he coached another NASL side, Chicago Sting and on his return to England sold insurance for a while before joining Exeter City as coach/physio. He was made redundant in 1984 and then took the post of physio for the Qatar FA in the Middle East.
On his return, two years later, he became coach/physio at Plymouth Argyle, where he stayed until joining former Hammer John Bond at Shrewsbury Town. There, he was part of the backroom staff when they won the Third Division title in 1993, before retiring in 1998.
On retiring, he moved back to Torquay with his wife, Jean, to be nearer their children, David, Martin & Allison, and grand-children. Unfortunately, Musgrove was already suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, which was to eventually take his life on 14 September 2007.

Feldjägerkorps

"For the modern German Military Police see: Feldjaeger"
The Feldjägerkorps was a military police organization in the German Wehrmacht during World War II. It was formed on 27 November 1943 from distinguished veterans and Patrol Service personnel. This corps was formed into three Feldjäger Commands (I, II and III), which reported directly to Field Marshal Keitel, and was senior to all other military police organizations.
This was divided into 30 (Streifen) Patrols, which were based 12 miles behind the front lines. These patrols could be rough in their justice, which included summary executions. They were supported by a "Streifkorps" (Patrol Corps), organized into sections of a senior non-commissioned officer and 9 enlisted personnel.
History.
By 1943, World War II was turning against Germany and morale amongst the front line troops was dropping. Until this time, the Feldgendarmerie and Geheime Feldpolizei had been relied upon to try to curb desertion and maintain discipline, however these men had other duties as well and the situation was getting out of hand. In November 1943, a new formation was created - the Feldjägerkorps. In order to be eligible for service, soldiers had to have a minimum 3 years frontline combat experience and have earned the Iron Cross 2nd class.
Organization.
The Feldjägerkorps consisted of 3 Feldjägerkommando:
Feldjägerkommando I and II saw action on the Eastern front, whilst Feldjägerkommando III saw action on the western front. 
Each "Feldjägerkommandeur" originally controlled an Feldjägerabteilungen (battalion), and from 24 April 1944, a regiment). The Fj battalion consisted of five motorized companies, each of 30 officers and 90 non-commissioned officers. The Feldjägerregiment contained five Feldjägerabteilungen each of which contained three Kompanies, of about 50 men. 
The basic unit was the Streife (patrol) which was made up of anywhere between 1 Feldjäger and 3 Feldjäger and an officer.
Mission.
The authority of the Feldjägerkorps came directly from the German Army High Command, and as such even the lowest ranking soldier theoretically carried more power than army officers. The commanding officer of a Feldjägerkommando had the same level of authority as an Armee commander with the authority to punish any soldier of any branch of service (the Waffen SS included).
The Feldjägerkorps operated parallel to the front line and approximately 12–15 miles behind it. Their basic duties were to:
They could also be employed in the same capacity as the Feldgendarmerie.
After the surrender of Germany, Feldjägerkommando III remained armed and at the disposal of the US Army in order to maintain discipline amongst the German PoWs. Feldjägerkommando III finally and formally surrendered its arms to the Allies on 23 June 1946.
Reputation.
Although the image of the Feldjäger was one of a tough, brutal soldier who shot on sight; this was often not the case. Veterans have stated that if they were caught by the Feldjäger, as long as they had a valid reason and the necessary paperwork to be behind the lines they were left alone. In only a very few cases on the Western front were summary executions used. More was to be feared from roaming groups of deserters or SS officers who took it upon themselves to "police" the rear line areas - in some cases fire fights between these groups and the Feldjägerkorps occurred.
Uniform.
The Feldjäger wore a normal German Army infantryman's uniform with white waffenfarbe. The only items which identified him were the gorget and red armband worn on the lower left cuff, bearing bold black lettering reading; Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - Feldjäger -
Other Feldjager units.
The SA-Feldjägerkorps - In October 1933 Hermann Göring established a supplementary police group for use within the State of Prussia. This group was also intended to have responsibilities in selected cities within Greater Germany. The unit consisted of former polizei members and volunteers recruited from existing Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) units. At this point in their history, leaders of the Nazi Party intended to use police brigades for protection as well as for gaining power over other political groups. Much of the intent of organizing these police units was to band together groups of men who had military training and knowledge stemming from their First World War experience. Designated the SA Field Police (SA-Feldjägerkorps), this formation was organized into eight battalions of approximately 195 men each with each battalion being assigned to a specific city or district with its headquarters in Berlin. Members of the SA-Feldjägerkorps were allowed to rejoin or transfer into the SS following completion of their service with the unit. On 1 April 1935 the SA-Feldjägerkorps was incorporated into the larger Prussian “Schutzpolizei” and was no longer under the control of the SA or related authorities. Over time, many smaller police units were organized or cluster together for the purpose of expanding control.

Nesttun–Os Line

The Nesttun–Os Line () was a narrow gauge railway between Nesttun, now part of Bergen, and the community of Osøyro in Os municipality, Norway. As the first private railway in Norway, it opened 1 June 1894, designed to connect Os to the Voss Line, allowing for passenger and freight transport to Bergen and Voss. Despite a boom caused by World War I, the railway was eventually driven out of business by competition from road transport, which provided faster service. On 2 September 1935, it became the first Norwegian railway to close, and most of the railway was demolished the following year.
Today, only short stretches of the railway and a few stations survive. Much of the former railway line is used as a bicycle path, which makes revival of the Nesttun–Os Railway as a heritage railway impossible. However, a 40 metre long railway stretch remains at Stend Station, the only unaltered remaining station, upon which a diesel locomotive and a passenger car are placed. The station building itself has been restored and is used as a museum.
History.
Proposals to build a railway from Nesttun to Os were first made during the planning of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss. Initial plans called for slightly longer route via Os, Samnanger, Norheimsund and Granvin. At the time it was required that local municipalities finance 20% of railways, and in 1874, Os Municipality was encouraged to purchase shares for NOK 8,000. This was rejected by the municipal council, and eventually the Voss Line was instead built via Dale. In 1884, a committee was established in Fana to consider the possibility of building a branch line from Nesttun to Fana. But neither the municipality nor the county were willing to give grants to the line, and, the plans were shelved in 1885. At the same time, the physician Daniel Schumann Krüger started to popularize the possibility of building a connection from Nesttun to Osøren (now Osøyro). At the time it was popular to build tracks along existing roads and use slow locomotives, and Krüger at first proposed such a solution, but later determined to support a conventional railway.
In 1884, a line from Os to Nesttun was estimated to cost NOK 885,000 plus land acquisition costs. Public meetings were held and in 1885 a committee was established. The following year, an application was sent to the state for NOK 3,000 in grants for preliminary work. It was presumed that the railway would be private, but the committee wanted to receive partial state funding. While the government favored the railway, the grant was a lower priority among the many proposed railway lines at the time. In 1888, an engineer from the state investigated the route, and recommended that the line be built via Rådal to increase the population which it would serve. In addition, Fanahammeren and Stend were regarded as transport hubs at the time. Following this, shares were issued for NOK 50,000 in the company, but this was not sufficient to finance the railway.
Instead of raising more capital, Krüger tried to reduce the cost. He proposed reducing the minimum curve radius from and reduce the gauge from the gauge used on the Voss Line to . This would allow the railway to have sharper curves and allow it to pass around any obstacles and hills, removing the need for cuttings and tunnels. Engineer Nicolay Nicolaysen Sontum started planning the cheaper railway in 1889, and he estimated the cost to NOK 500,000. After the project was marketed in the Bergen press, shipowners Fredrik Georg Gade and Johan A. Mowinckel supported it, as did major Wollert Konow (SB). An application for a concession was sent on 15 March 1890, in which Gade and Mowinckel guaranteed the necessary capital. This made Nesttun-Os the first railway in Norway to be built without state grants. The construction contract was signed with Sontum on 29 March.
The concession was granted on 2 February 1891 and had a duration of 40 years from the date the line started operation. The delay was in part because there was a debate about the gauge in the Parliament of Norway. The company opened for sales of shares on 3 March 1891. The largest owners were Gade (20%), Mowinckel (10%), Os Municipality (5%) and Krüger (2%). The municipality used a whole year's budget on the share purchases, and borrowed money to be repaid in 40 years. In addition to the share sales, the railway received free real estate from many farmers.
The railway was constructed in narrow gauge, the smallest gauge ever built in Norway. The smallest curve radius was 50 metres. This combination made it possible to avoid any tunnels whatsoever and the longest bridge was 8 metres. But it also meant that all goods had to be off-loaded at Nesttun and that the railway had a maximum speed of 25 km/h. The railway was of vast importance for the Os community, as it allowed for day trips to Bergen. The rail trip took only two hours, and was considerably faster and cheaper than travel by steam ship.
Despite a boom caused by World War I, the railway lost business to road transport, which provided faster service. On 2 September 1935, it became the first Norwegian railway to close, and most of the track was demolished the following year.
Heritage.
Most of the right-of-way still exists, although all the tracks were removed in 1936. In 1980, most of the right-of-way within Bergen was converted to a hiking and bicycle trail, and later asphalted. The right-of-way can therefore be walked from Nesttun to Kismul. Along there is a combined path and road, although the latter has little traffic. The section from Selsvik to Ytre Sandvika was converted to a bicycle path in 2002, and in 2008, the path was extended another kilometer (half a mile) past Kismul. The remaining section past Kalandseid has been regulated, but lack of funding has delayed the process. While hiking is possible, the path is overgrown and some places become a swamp.
From Kalandseid to Søfteland, the route runs next to European Route E39. South from Kalandseid, the route goes through private agricultural land towards Røykenes. In Os there is a section from Tømmernes to Søfteland that has been asphalted as a path. From Storestraumen south of Søfteland, about one kilometer (half a mile) has been converted to a gravel path. On this section is Bergstø Bridge, where of track has been laid.
Stend Station has been converted to a railway museum and is the only station building to remain in its original design. In the 1980s, the building had fallen into disrepair, but from 1987, Friends of the Os Line started renovating it. It has a small display of artifacts from the railway, including old pictures, a film and items, including tools from the workshop. Outside there is a long railway line. On it is a draisine from 1925, a combined third-class and post wagon from 1894. It consists of two half frames that were welded together, with bogies bought from Poland. It is the smallest bogies wagon in Norway. The station also features a water station. The museum also has a diesel locomotive which dates from 1967. It was used by Fana and later Bergen Municipality in the sewer tunnels, and was given to the museum in 1995. It features gauge, but otherwise has no resemblance with the material used on the Nesttun–Os Line.
Os Station has been preserved and is owned by Os Municipality. Plans exist to renovate and revert it back to its look from 1894, but lack of money has only resulted in the station being painted in the original colors. Plans call for a short section of track to be laid on the station area. The workshop has become the location of a sewer pumping station, although the exterior has been renovated to the original. The depot was built with decorative pillars, but there were built over in the 1930s. In the 1990s, these were removed again. Os Cultural Development has the rights to use the municipally owned building, and they have stated that they plan to convert it to a center for art. The building is planned expanded with a glass facade towards the fjord is planned, which would feature art workshops and ateliers.
Ulven Station also remains, has been modernized and serves as a private residence. All the buildings at Kalandseid Station have been demolished, except a private residence. The station area of Hamre Station has been converted to a turning spot for buses. Fana Station still stands, but has been renovated and modernized to the unrecognizable, and serves as a private residence. Rådal Station is in use as a private residence.
Two passenger cars are displayed at the Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar, after they had served on the Urskog–Høland Line from 1935 to 1960. They are used on the museums "Tertitt" train that runs on the museum area. They were renovated in 1994–95. Os Municipality has a dismounted half wagon frame from an Oldbury wagon dating from 1894. A wagon frame built by Skabo in 1907 is in use in a garden at Kismul. It includes some original benches.

Open-source video game

An open-source video game, or simply an open-source game, is a video game whose source code is open-source. They are often freely distributable and sometimes cross-platform compatible. Many are included in Linux distributions as a result.
Open source games which are free software and contain exclusively free content are called free games. Most free games are open-source, but not all open-source games are free software; some open-source games contain proprietary non-free content.
Background.
In general, open-source games are developed by small groups of people in their free time, with profit not being the main focus. Almost all open-source games are volunteer-run projects, and as such, developers of free games are often hobbyists and enthusiasts. The consequence of this is that open-source games often take longer to mature, are less common and often lack the quality of commercial titles. One of the challenges to building high-quality content for games is it often requires expensive tools like 3D modeller or a toolset for level design.
Some of the open-source game projects are based on formerly proprietary games, whose source code was released as open-source software, while the game content (such as graphics, audio and levels) may or may not be under a free license. Examples include "Warzone 2100" (a real-time strategy game) and "Micropolis" (a city-building simulator based on the "SimCity" source code). Advantage of such continuation projects is that these games are already "complete" as graphic and audio content is available, and therefore the open-source authors can focus on porting, fixing bugs or modding the games.
History.
Beginnings and early games.
Just as in most other forms of software, free software was an unconscious occurrence during the creation of early computer games, particularity for earlier Unix games. These are mostly original or clone arcade games and text adventures. A notable example of this is BSD Games, a collection of interactive fiction titles. Game fan communities such as the modding community do include some aspects of free software, such as sharing mods across community sites, sometimes with free to use media made for the modification. With the rise of proprietary software in the mid to late 1980s, games became more and more proprietary. However, this also led to the first deliberately free games such as GNU Chess of the GNU Project, part of whose goal is to create a complete free software system, games included. More advanced free gaming projects emerged, such as NetHack and Netrek, many still developed and played today in front-ends such as Vulture's Eye.
As PC gaming began to rise in the late 1980s and early 1990s, free gaming also advanced. More complicated games utilizing the X Window System for graphics started to emerge, most beginning with the signature letter X. These included XBill, XEvil, xbattle, Xconq and XPilot. XBill is notable as one of the earliest free gaming titles to feature an activist theme of halting proprietary software adoption. This theme was echoed in later titles such as FreeDroidRPG. XEvil followed the development cycle of many early pieces of free software, having originally been developed as a university project, although it was freeware for a while. The game was also one of the first free titles to feature controversial subject matter such as graphic violence and drug use. Rocks'n'Diamonds is another earlier free software game, and one of the first for Linux.
The FreeCiv project was started in 1995 and gave rise to another new style of free game development. Similar to the cooperative nature of the Linux kernel development, FreeCiv was extended by many volunteers, rather than only one or two authors. It had started out as a small university student project but then branched out into its current form and is still being developed today. FreeCiv also proved to be one of the earliest hit free software games, and was among the first to be included with Linux distributions, a system commonly known now as a source of peer review or selection of quality for free gaming projects. Magazines, news sources and websites have also started noting free games, often in listings. FreeCiv and other archetypes have led to the development of many other clones of popular proprietary games. BZFlag, first worked on a few years earlier, is another project that had humble beginnings but grew into a popular and heavily developed project.
3D games and source releases.
Proprietary games such as Doom and Descent brought in the age of three-dimensional games in the early to mid 1990s, and free games started to make the switch themselves. Tuxedo T. Penguin: A Quest for Herring by Steve Baker, a game featuring the Linux mascot Tux, was an early example of a three-dimensional free software game. He and his son Oliver would later create other popular 3D free games and clones such as TuxKart and contribute to those by other developers such as Tux Racer. The Genesis3D engine project, Crystal Space and Cube also spawned other 3D free software engines and games. FlightGear is another good example, especially noting that it is not a shooter engine but a flight simulator.
id Software, an early entrant into commercial Linux gaming, would also prove to be an early supporter of free gaming when John D. Carmack released the source code for Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, first under a custom license and then later the GPL. This was followed by the release of Quake engine, id Tech 2, id Tech 3 and most recently id Tech 4. This led not only to source ports that allowed the playing of the non-free games based on these engines (plus fan added enhancements) on free engines and systems, but also to new free games such as Freedoom, Nexuiz/Xonotic, Tremulous, and OpenArena. Freeware games, such as , Warsow, World of Padman and Urban Terror, have also taken advantage of these free engines and sometimes have given code back to the community. id Tech 4 was released as free software, even amongst patent concerns from Creative Labs. Development and editing tools are also commonly released freely, such as GtkRadiant.
id partners and related, such as Raven Software, Bungie Software and 3D Realms, as well as several of the developers who participated in the Humble Indie Bundle, have also released code and it is now accepted practice for some mainstream game developers to release legacy source code. Formerly proprietary games such as Jump 'n bump, Meritous, Warzone 2100, HoverRace and Abuse have even been entirely released freely, including multimedia assets and levels. Some games are mostly free software but contain some proprietary content such as the Cube sequel, or the former Quake III Arena mod Smokin' Guns, but some developers desire and/or work on replacing these with free content. Primarily proprietary developers have also helped free gaming by creating free libraries. Loki Software helped create and maintain the Simple DirectMedia Layer and OpenAL libraries and Linux Game Publishing created and maintain the free network layer Grapple. LGP also avoids publishing games similar to popular free titles. Many libraries/infrastructures have been created without corporate assistance however, such as the online gaming system GGZ Gaming Zone. In addition, various game creators are free software such as the ZZT remake MegaZeux, versions of Game Editor, the inspired G-Creator, Godot, Construct, and ZGameEditor.
Rise in popularity and diversity.
Individuals and teams have continued creating many popular free software games, starting really in the late 1990s to the present day. Many of these are clones such as Pingus (Lemmings clone), SuperTux and Secret Maryo Chronicles (Super Mario Bros-inspired), WarMUX and Hedgewars (Worms) as well as Frets on Fire, which is a recreation of Guitar Hero. A number of these games and those mentioned earlier and later in this section have even received mainstream press coverage and have helped to establish free gaming as a moderately popular pastime, even if mostly enjoyed by Linux and BSD users. Frozen Bubble, originally a clone of Puzzle Bobble, has become a classic known for its addictive gameplay and winner of many Linux Journal reader's choice awards. These games and others have also helped expand the prevalent Tux genre which started with titles and like A Quest for Herring and are related to the activist content of games like XBill. More unique games like Neverball, another 3D title, have also been able to carve out their own niches.
Strategy games have also been a prevalent force in free software gaming, partly due to the lack of proprietary strategy games for free software operating systems as compared to other genres like first-person shooters and role playing games. FreeCiv began the trend, and was followed by other clone titles like FreeCol, LinCity and Widelands. The Stratagus project began as an attempt to recreate the proprietary Warcraft II engine, under the name FreeCraft. Blizzard Entertainment sent a cease and desist letter in 2003 over the use of the name "craft" in comparison to Warcraft and "StarCraft". Though the earlier free software strategy game CRAFT: The Vicious Vikings shared the name "craft" without controversy.
With the new, legally inoffensive name Stratagus, the team began work on a new strategy game called Bos Wars. Development on this game still continues, as well as the modern Warcraft II port Wargus. Other games branched out of the engine project as well such as the Battle for Mandicor and Astroseries projects and the StarCraft port attempt Stargus. After the Stratagus example, other real time strategy games were developed, such as Globulation 2, which experiments with game management mechanics, 0 A.D., a former freeware project, and the 3D projects Spring and Glest. In addition, the more economically driven strategy game Widelands bases itself upon the proprietary Settlers franchise.
Racing games, another uncommon Linux commercial genre, has also seen development with TORCS and VDrift, as well as the Mario Kart-inspired SuperTuxKart. WorldForge is another example of increasing diversification, in its attempt to create a free massively multiplayer online role playing game. Free software is also the main source for educational and children's software specifically for Linux, usually utilizing the child appeal of the Tux mascot, such as Tux Paint, Tux, of Math Command, Tux Typing and related efforts.
Greater organization.
Despite its initial roots as small private projects, the free software gaming scene has been becoming progressively more organized. The roots of this even go back as far as the games created for the GNU Project and to the original larger-scale free software projects like FreeCiv. Still, for the most part free game development had very little organization throughout its history. Popular games were generally separate efforts, except for instances of people working on them known for other projects such as Ingo Ruhnke, Bill Kendrick and Steve Baker. Games were commonly found in directories such as The Linux Game Tome and Freshmeat and hosted on sites like SourceForge, but they were largely only ever brought together in the form of disorganized lists. Other projects and games existed purely on small isolated personal or project websites, often unknown and ignored.
The launch of the GNOME and KDE desktop projects in the late 1990s organized application and, to a certain extent, game development. Both attempts to create a more usable Linux desktop attracted volunteers to make utilities to that end. These programs included games, mostly recreations of small games like Minesweeper or Solitaire that come with Microsoft Windows, arcade classics and the like, games from combined packs such as the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack, and occasionally original ideas. The variety and amount of these games, and other free games easily found in software repositories, have even led some to call GNOME or KDE-enabled Linux a better option for out of the box casual gaming than Microsoft Windows. Examples include gbrainy, Gnomine and KAtomic. Many such games are packaged into GNOME Games and kdegames. The availability of free game engines, such as Stratagus, Pygame, Sauerbraten and most prominently ioquake3 have also helped unify free software development by making the engine projects themselves hubs of activity for games that make use of them.
The Battle for Wesnoth project was started in 2003 and quickly became popular to both players and editors. It also showcased some new ideas when it came to free game development. Like FreeCiv before it, it utilized the efforts of the gaming and free software community and their code, levels and artwork contributions but it also accepted storyline contributions and ideas for the game's entire fictional universe. The game's canon is maintained through review and discussion over which submitted campaigns become official, thus setting up a model for community input and organized results. This helped the game grow in scale and popularity to the point of being almost saga-like in scope. In addition, the project is worked on by many well-known free programmers, artists, designers and musicians such as the co-founder of the Open Source Initiative Eric S. Raymond, and Linux kernel hacker Rusty Russell. Vega Strike has similarly allowed its community to expand the game and the surrounding lore while maintaining canon consistency.
Hubs and development teams.
The general lack of unity and organization has created and continues to generate some controversy among the free software community, with problems of "reinventing the wheel" by making similar clones, games and multimedia resources being cited as a notable problem to free game development. This is especially taking up more notice as other problems are corrected, such as a lack of tools, libraries, artists and coders. A more central knowledge bank, texture library, and discussion area have been called for several times.
Traditionally free software video games were developed as individual projects, some small scale and others larger scale. Programmers and other developers did often work on other projects, but the whole system was very unlinked. More recently free software development teams have started appearing, groups that function like software companies and create multiple pieces of work. Examples include the developer Parallel Realities, which have released the games Project: Starfighter, The Legend of Edgar, , as well as its sequel, .
In recent years, content repositories such as OpenGameArt.org and The Freesound Project have enabled developers to easily find appropriately-licensed content rather than relying on programmer art. Such content is often under Creative Commons licenses or those in the GNU General Public License family, easily facilitating use by most free software projects.
The Linux Game Tome "Game of the Month" team was an open group of game developers that revamp old free software games. Some examples include the transformation of TuxKart into the more modern SuperTuxKart, work on Pingus and SuperTux and LinCity-NG, an updated version of LinCity with superior graphics.

Her second novel in English, "The Bastard of Istanbul", was the bestselling book of 2006 in Turkey and was longlisted for the Orange prize. The novel, which tells the story of an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women, brought Şafak under prosecution but the charges were subsequently dismissed.
Following the birth of her daughter in 2006 she suffered from post-natal depression, an experience she addressed in her first autobiographical book, "Siyah Süt" ("Black Milk"). In this book Şafak explored the beauties and difficulties of being a writer and a mother. The book was received with great interest and acclaim by critics and readers alike, and became an instant bestseller.
Şafak's novel "The Forty Rules of Love" focused on love in the light of Rumi and Shams of Tabriz. It sold more than 750,000 copies, becoming an all time best-seller in Turkey and in France was awarded a Prix ALEF* - Mention Spéciale Littérature Etrangére. It was also nominated for the 2012 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. 
Her latest novel in English, "Iskender" ("Honour"), has topped the best-seller lists and has been acclaimed by both critics and readers of various ages and backgrounds. The novel has opened up a vivid debate in Turkey about family, love, freedom, redemption and the construct of masculinity. It was nominated for the 2012 Man Asian Literary Prize and Women’s Prize for Fiction, 2013.
Her most recent novel revolves around the life of Mimar Sinan, the most famous Ottoman architect and opens up important debates on power, creativity, artistic freedom and bigotry.
Academic life.

Elif Şafak holds various social, academic roles. She is an active social media figure with 1.5 million Twitter followers http://twitter.com/Elif_Safak. Besides her professional titles Elif Shafak is a TED Global speaker, founding member of ECFR (European Council on Foreign Relations); member of Weforum Global Agenda Council on The Role of Arts in Society; the 2013 judging panel for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the 2014 judging panel for the Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award; Ambassador of Culture Action Europe Campaign, 2010; Special Envoy for EU-Turkey Cultural Bridges Programme, 2010. She was awarded the honorary distinction of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2010.
Early life.
Şafak was born Elif Bilgin in Strasbourg to philosopher Nuri Bilgin and Şafak Atayman who later became a diplomat. When she was a year old her parents separated and Şafak was raised by a single mother. She says not growing up in a typical patriarchal family had a great impact on her work and writing. She incorporated her mother's first name, which means Dawn, with her own when constructing her pen name.
Şafak spent her teenage years in Madrid and Amman before returning to Turkey. She has lived around the world -Boston, Michigan, Arizona, Istanbul and London- and her writing has thrived upon these journeys. She sees herself as not just migrating from country to country, city to city but language to language, even in her native Turkish she believes she plays to the vocabularies of different cultures. Through it all she has maintained a deep attachment to the city of Istanbul, which plays an important part in her fiction. As a result, a sense of multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism has consistently characterized both her life and her work.
Istanbul.
Istanbul has always been a central part of Şafak’s writing. She depicts the city as a ‘She-city’ and likens her to an old woman with a young heart who is eternally hungry for new stories and new loves. Şafak has remarked “Istanbul makes one comprehend, perhaps not intellectually but intuitively, that East and West are ultimately imaginary concepts, and can thereby be de-imagined and re-imagined.” In the same essay written for "Time Magazine" Şafak says "East and West is no water and oil. They do mix. And in a city like Istanbul they mix intensely, incessantly, amazingly."
In a piece she wrote for the BBC, she said, “Istanbul is like a huge, colourful Matrushka - you open it and find another doll inside. You open that, only to see a new doll nesting. It is a hall of mirrors where nothing is quite what it seems. One should be cautious when using categories to talk about Istanbul. If there is one thing the city doesn't like, it is clichés."
She lives with her husband and two children and divides her time between Istanbul and London.
Sufism.
Şafak first became interested in Sufism as a college student in her early 20s, and it has reverberated through her writing and her life ever since. In "The Forty Rules of Love", she tackles the subject head on with a modern love story between a Jewish-American housewife and a modern Sufi living in Amsterdam. Their unusual story is set against a historical background that narrates the remarkable spiritual bond between Rumi and Shams Tabrizi. She said in an interview given to "The Guardian", "The more you read about Sufism, the more you have to listen. In time I became emotionally attached. When I was younger I wasn't interested in understanding the world. I only wanted to change it, through feminism or nihilism or environmentalism. But the more I read about Sufism the more I unlearned. Because that is what Sufism does to you, it makes you erase what you know, what you are so sure of. And then start thinking again. Not with your mind this time, but with your heart."
Motherhood, feminism and post-feminism.
Elif Şafak grew up with two very different models of Turkish motherhood – her modern, working, educated mother and her traditional, religious grandmother. Her writing has always addressed minorities and subcultures, such post-colonialism and post-feminism, and in particular the role of women in society.
Following the birth of her daughter in 2006 she suffered from postpartum depression, a period she then addressed in her memoir, "Black Milk: on Motherhood, Writing and the Harem Within" which combines fiction and non-fiction genres. Şafak has commented concerning the book: "I named this book Black Milk for two reasons. First, it deals with postpartum depression and shows that mother's milk is not always as white and spotless as society likes to think it is. Second, out of that depression I was able to get an inspiration; out of that black milk I was able to develop some sort of ink."

Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam

The Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam (formerly known as the Sunbury Fabridam) is the world's longest inflatable dam. The dam is located just below the confluence of the Western and Main Branches of the Susquehanna, in Upper Augusta Township, between the town of Shamokin Dam and the city of Sunbury, Pennsylvania.
The dam is 2,100 feet (640 m) long. When it is raised in the summer time, it creates the 3,000 acre (12 km²) Lake Augusta, which is used for recreation. The dam and lake are part of Shikellamy State Park.
In 2001, the dam was renamed for Adam T. Bower, Chief Clerk of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1967–68 and Director of Services during the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, by Act 2001-5 of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.
There are plans underway to add a fish ladder to the dam. The fish ladder is primarily to allow the American shad to access the upper part of the Susquehanna. For the 2007 season the dam was slated to be deflated slowly over the period from August 20 through August 23. This earlier than usual lowering of the dam was to facilitate the replacement and repair of at least 3 of the synthetic bags which comprise the dam.
Shamokin Dam.
On this site there was the earlier Shamokin Dam. This dam maintained an adequate water level for ferry traffic across the Susquehanna from Shamokin (now Sunbury) to the west bank. It was destroyed in March, 1904 by the breakup of 22 inches (56 cm) of ice in the spring thaw. This is the dam for which the west bank town of Shamokin Dam was named.
There is another, existing, low head dam 1.2 miles (1.9 km) down stream, for the Shamokin Dam Power Plant.

Littledean Hall

Littledean Hall () is a country house in the village of Littledean, Gloucestershire, England. It is reputedly one of the most haunted houses in England and is thought to be the oldest house in the United Kingdom which is still occupied. Saxon and Celtic remains have been uncovered in the cellars. Part of the house is designated an SSSI as it is a proven breeding roost for the Greater Horseshoe Bat "(Rhinolophus ferrumequinum)".
Architecture and History.
Originally a Saxon hall, then a church, it was then converted to a Norman hall, complete with a crypt and undercroft. Testing has shown that these remains date back to the 5th century. However, when records began of the house in 1080, it had evolved into a substantial medieval manor house which was eventually replaced with a Jacobean house in 1612.
The hall has seven bedrooms, a coach house, a dining room, sitting and drawing rooms, a stable, living room and cellar. The estate covers four acres. The sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) which line the driveway are at least 500 years old and the remains of a Roman road have been found underneath the drive itself. 
In 2007 the building suffered damage after lightning struck nearby and in 2008 the owners of the hall were ordered to rebuild a section of wall they had knocked down. The wall was deemed to be a Grade II listed building alongside the main hall.
Reports of hauntings.
There are at least three distinct tales which are said to have led to hauntings at Littledean Hall. The first is the deaths of Colonel Congreve and Colonel Wigmore, who both died when the Kings garrison met with roundheads in the dining room. It is reported that visitors can still see the bloodstains where they fell.
In 1741 Charles Pyrke, former occupant of the house, was accused of raping the sister of his servant. The servant promptly murdered Pyrke before being put to death himself. The servant's ghost is thought by some to haunt the hall to this day and it has been reported to be carrying a candle. Two other Pyrke brothers are said to wander the halls, having killed each other in a duel in 1740. 
There have also been claimed sightings of a headless horseman and a 'Lady in Yellow' which have not been ascribed to any particular event. When the halls were opened to visitors in 1983, there were several reports of strange sightings, dizziness and other disturbances felt by guests.
Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar SSSI.
Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar () is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1988. The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).
The hall (coach house and cellar) is currently home to Greater horseshoe bats which makes it a Site of Special Scientific Interest which is closely monitored by Natural England. It is a significant breeding roost and its used have been recorded since 1986. Local reports indicated that bats may have used the building for over 75 years.
Location and habitat.
The site is one of a series of Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley (Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire). These sites support (between them) breeding and hibernation roosts for Lesser and Greater horseshoe bats. This is of European importance. Other sites in the group in Gloucestershire (all of which are SSSIs) include the breeding sites of Blaisdon Hall, Caerwood And Ashberry Goose House, and Sylvan House Barn. Hibernation sites include Buckshraft Mine & Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel, Devil's Chapel Scowles, Old Bow And Old Ham Mines and Westbury Brook Ironstone Mine.
The deciduous woodlands and sheltered valleys of the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley provide a good feeding area, and the underground systems provide roosting and breeding sites. A ring of iron-ore bearing Carboniferous Limestone in the Forest of Dean has created a series of ancient and more recent mines which provide hibernation sites. The citations for the series of sites provide common information. 
Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Bat Sites/ Safleoedd Ystlumod Dyffryn Gwy a Fforest y Ddena are recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.

Luftwaffe Field Division

The Luftwaffe Field Divisions (German: "Luftwaffen-Feld-Divisionen" or LwFD) were German military formations during World War II.
History.
The divisions were originally authorized in October 1942, following suggestions that the German Army, the "Heer", could be bolstered by transferring personnel from other services. The head of the "Luftwaffe", Hermann Göring, formulated an alternative plan to raise his own infantry formations under the command of "Luftwaffe" officers; this was at least partly due to political differences with the "Heer". Goering took great pride in the degree of political commitment and indoctrination of the air force men (he went as far as to describe the air-force paratroopers as "political soldiers") while the Army was considered (by Nazi standards) too "conservative" (linked to traditions and ideals harking back to the Imperial days of the Kaiser).
The plan was approved, and the divisions were raised from 200,000–250,000 "Luftwaffe" ground, support and other excess personnel. They were initially organized with two Jäger regiments of three battalions each, along with an artillery battalion and other support units, but were substantially smaller than equivalent "Heer" divisions, and by Göring's personal order were intended to be restricted to defensive duties in quieter sectors. Most of the units spent much of their existence on the Eastern Front: Luftwaffe Field Divisions were present at actions such as the "Little Stalingrad of the North", the attempt to relieve Velikiye Luki; the attempted defence of Vitebsk during Operation Bagration, and the fighting in the Courland Pocket, though they also fought in other theatres.
The Luftwaffe Field Divisions initially remained under "Luftwaffe" command, but late in 1943 those that had not already been disbanded were handed over to the "Heer" and were reorganized as standard infantry divisions with three two-battalion rifle regiments (retaining their numbering, but with "Luftwaffe" attached to distinguish them from similarly numbered divisions already existing in the "Heer") and Army officers.
Until taken over by the "Heer" (and in many cases for some time afterwards) these units were issued with standard "Luftwaffe" "feldblau" uniforms, and being so easily identifiable were said to often be singled out by opposite forces. Their reputation as combat troops was poor, despite the high standard of "Luftwaffe" recruits, at least in part from being required to perform roles (ground warfare) for which they as airmen had little training. They were frequently used for rear echelon duties to free up front line troops.

Choplifter III

Summary.
In Europe, a remake of "Choplifter II" was released under the same name, and later ported to Game Gear. Despite the confusing name change, these are not conversions of the Super Nintendo game. It was the third "Choplifter" title starting with the original Apple II game released in 1982. The gameplay revolves around piloting a rescue helicopter into hostile territory and rescuing hostages. The player's task is made more complicated by the limited number of hostages the helicopter can carry as well as increasing difficulty throughout the four chapters of the game. Each chapter is set in a different environment, starting off with jungle, then desert, sea and finally city.
The game also has a number of minibosses spread throughout the campaign.

Kristiansund BK

Kristiansund Ballklubb is a Norwegian football club located in Kristiansund. It currently plays in the Norwegian First Division. Kristiansund BK was formed in the autumn of 2003, when two rival clubs of Kristiansund, Kristiansund FK and Clausenengen FK, agreed to establish a new elite team.
History.
Since Magnar Isaksen won a bronze medal in the 1936 Summer Olympics, many footballers from Kristiansund have played for the Norwegian national team including Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Øyvind Leonhardsen and Trond Andersen. In addition have players like Ola Lyngvær, Jan Erlend Kruse, Arild Stavrum, Ole Erik Stavrum and Andre Flem has played for different clubs in the Norwegian Premier League, and Clausenengen has been called a "talent factory". Nevertheless, the football clubs from Kristiansund has had limited success, with Kristiansund FK's spell in the First Division in 1991 and Clausenengen in 1999 as the most recent.
In 2003, the local bank Sparebank 1 Nordvest initiated a merge between Kristiansund FK and Clausenengen, with the bank as the main sponsor of the new club paying per year. Kristiansund BK was founded on 2 September 2003 and replaced Kristiansund FK in the Third Division, with the other two clubs continuing to play in the lower divisions.
The club finished second behind Træff in their Third Division group in 2004 and won promotion to the Second Division in 2005 after beating Volda in the 4-2 on aggregate in the promotion playoff. In 2006, Kristiansund finished seventh in their first season in the Second Division. Ahead of the 2007-season, Geir Midtsian replaced Ole Gunnar Iversen as head coach and with New Zealand international Kris Bright on the team, who scored 23 goals in 26 matches for the club, Kristiansund BK started to look like a contender for promotion and finished fifth in 2007 and fourth in 2008. The team also eliminated the Rosenborg in the second round of the 2008 Norwegian Football Cup.
After finishing third in 2009, the club's goal was promotion to the First Division, and in March 2010 Kristiansund BK and Surnadal IL started a cooperation with Molde FK on developing local players. In August 2010 Molde FK loaned out Elias Valderhaug and Jacob Falch Meidell to Kristiansund BK to help out in the race for promotion, but the team finished second behind Hødd. After a suffering from bad results in the beginning of the 2011-season, Midtsian decided to withdrew as head coach in July 2011, while his assistants Per Eirik Bentz and Torgeir Fredly was in charge until the club hired a new head coach. The team's results improved in the second half of the season and finished second behind Bærum.
On 10 November 2011, Kristiansund BK announced that they had hired Geir Bakke, who had previously worked as assistant coach at the first-tier clubs Vålerenga and Stabæk, as head coach starting from 1 January 2012. After playing 21 matches without losing, the club was promoted to the First Division on 16 September 2012, as winners of their 2012 Norwegian Second Division group in 2012.

Mike Green (footballer born 1946)

Michael Clive "Mike" Green (born 8 September 1946) is an English former professional football player and manager. As player, he made more than 400 appearances in the Football League as a centre half for Carlisle United, Gillingham, Bristol Rovers, Plymouth Argyle and Torquay United. As manager, he took charge of Torquay United.
Green was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, and began his career as an apprentice with Carlisle United, turning professional in September 1964. He played only two league games for Carlisle, both the following season, before moving to Gillingham in July 1968. He soon found a regular place at the Priestfield Stadium, playing 132 league games, scoring 24 goals.
He moved to Bristol Rovers in July 1971 and was appointed captain of the Eastville side. In July 1974, after 2 goals in 77 games, he moved to Plymouth Argyle for a fee of £19,000. He captained Argyle to promotion from Division Three at the end of his first season at Home Park, going onto play 108 league games, scoring 8 goals, before leaving for local rivals Torquay United in March 1977 as player-manager for a fee of £5,000.
Working with the experienced Frank O'Farrell as the general manager, he put together an attacking side at Plainmoor, but could never get them challenging for promotion, not helped by the lack of funds at his disposal. He retired from playing, after 88 league games and 7 goals, to concentrate on his managerial duties. During the 1979-80 season he surprisingly turned down an offer to manage Second Division Bristol Rovers to remain at Plainmoor, but was sacked in May 1981 after a disappointing season, with O'Farrell taking over as team manager for a third time.
He subsequently played for local non-league side Newton Abbot and later managed a sub-post office in Torquay.

Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne

Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne or Voyage de Charlemagne à Jérusalem et à Constantinople ("Pilgrimage of Charlemagne" or "Charlemagne's Voyage to Jerusalem and Constantinople") is an Old French "chanson de geste" (epic poem) dealing with a fictional expedition by Charlemagne and his knights. The oldest known written version was probably composed around 1140. Two 15th-century reworkings of the story are also known.
Summary.
In the story, Charlemagne asks his wife if she thinks he is the most handsome king in the world. To Charlemagne's outrage, she answers that the (fictional) Byzantine Emperor Hugo is better looking. Under the pretence of a pilgrimage, Charlemagne and his Twelve Peers set out for the east. They go to Jerusalem first, where they meet the patriarch, who gives them many important relics to take back, and also the title of Emperor. On the way home, they stop at Constantinople, a very beautiful and rich city free from theft and poverty. There they meet Hugo, indeed a very handsome and glorious king, standing on a golden plough. They are invited to the palace, an edifice which stands on a pole and revolves when the wind revolves.
Charlemagne and the Peers are welcomed in courtly fashion and they are assigned a beautiful room, in which King Hugo has hidden a spy. Charlemagne and his companions drink too much and start to "gabber", to joke, about their extraordinary abilities. Olivier says he can sleep with Hugo's daughter a hundred times during a single night, Turpin claims he can juggle apples while standing with each leg on a different running horse, and so forth. The next day, when confronted with these lies, Charlemagne and his Peers retreat to their quarters ashamed. There, they pray to God in front of the relics, and promptly an angel appears, saying he will help Charlemagne.
Charlemagne returns to Hugo and claims that he is indeed capable of all the things he and his companions boasted about. Hugo doesn't believe it, but with the help of God, the Peers can perform their tasks. Hugo is very impressed and takes a vow to become Charlemagne's vassal.
Once back home he forgives his wife and becomes a more pious king.
Later use.
Whether "Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne" is a satire on the genre of the "chanson de geste" or not is debated. Also, date and location of composition of the poem is unknown. The text has also been translated into Old Norse prose, into the so-called "Karlamagnus Saga". The prose translation into Middle Welsh, "Pererindod Siarlymaen", is found complete together with the other tales of the Welsh cycle of Charlemagne, "Cân Rolant", "Cronicl Turpin" and "Rhamant Otuel", in two Welsh manuscripts of the middle of the 14th and late-14th century (White Book of Rhydderch, Peniarth 5, and Red Book of Hergest).
The later "chanson de geste" "Galiens li Restorés" derives, in part, from the "Pèlerinage" and tells of the adventures of Galien, the son of Olivier and the Emperor of Byzantium's daughter.

Education.
Bryza graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International relations and obtained his Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University in 1988.
Career.
Beginning of the foreign service.
Bryza joined the United States Foreign Service in August 1988. He then served in Poland in 1989-1991 at the U.S. Consulate in Poznań and the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, where he covered the Solidarity movement, reform of Poland’s security services, and regional politics. From 1991 through 1995, he worked on European and Russian affairs at the State Department. Bryza served at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during 1995-1997, first as special assistant to Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and then as a political officer covering the Russian Duma, Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus. He was recalled from Moscow after he allegedly hit a pedestrian in August 1997. From 1997 through 1998, Bryza was special advisor to Ambassador Richard Morningstar, coordinating U.S. Government assistance programs on economic reforms in Caucasus and Central Asia. Starting from July, 1998 he served as the Deputy Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Caspian Basin Energy Diplomacy, coordinating the U.S. Government's inter-agency efforts to develop a network of oil and gas pipelines in the Caspian region.
European and Eurasian Affairs.
In April 2001, Bryza joined the United States National Security Council as Director for Europe and Eurasia, with responsibility for coordinating U.S. policy on Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Caspian energy. In June 2005, he assumed duties of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.

Appointment as Ambassador to Azerbaijan.
In May 2010, the White House appointed Bryza as the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan. On September 21, 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his ambassadorial nomination and sent it to the Senate floor.

On December 29, 2010 Bryza's appointment by President Obama was confirmed by the White House as a recess appointment. He served as ambassador to Azerbaijan starting from February 2011.
In January 2012 Bryza left the post and the foreign service as the Senate did not confirm his nomination due to the opposition by Armenian-American lobbying groups who alleged his ties with the Azerbaijani government.

<doc id="5977075" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977075" title="1913 Tour de France">
1913 Tour de France

The 1913 Tour de France was the 11th Tour de France, taking place between 29 June and 27 July 1913. The total distance was and the average speed of the riders was . The competition was won by the Belgian Philippe Thys, after in the crucial sixth stage Eugène Christophe broke his bicycle and lost several hours because he had to do the repairs by himself. In the last stage, Thys also had mechanical problems, but he got help during the repairs, and only got a penalty of ten minutes.
Between 1904 and 1912, the overall classification had been calculated by points, but in 1913 the classification was reverted to the original format from 1903, where the overall classification was calculated by adding up the times of the individual stages. The general classification has been calculated in the time format ever since.
Changes from the 1912 Tour de France.
In 1905, the format of the Tour de France had been changed from the time system to the points system, to reduce the cheating that had caused the first four cyclists of the 1904 Tour de France to be disqualified. In the 1912 Tour de France, this system had been working against Eugène Christophe's chances, who would have been leading the time classification up until the final stage where he allowed a group to ride away. The system had been working against a French cyclist and in favor of a Belgian cyclist (Odiel Defraye, who won the Tour de France in 1912), and the French organisation changed the system back again to the time system: the finishing times of all stages were added per cyclist, and the cyclist with the least total time was the winner.
For the first time, the route of the race was in the opposite direction. Prior to the 1913 race, the Tour the France always had been in the clockwise direction through France, and in 1913 it was counterclockwise.
Participants.
The 1913 Tour started with 140 cyclists; there were 51 cyclists distributed over 9 teams, including all favourites for the overall victory. The remaining 89 cyclists started in the isolés category. This edition started with six former Tour de France winners (Louis Trousselier, Lucien Petit-Breton, François Faber, Octave Lapize, Gustave Garrigou and Odile Defraye), the most ever.
Although cyclists had started in teams previously, the rules had forbidden them to work together against other cyclists. In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organizers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.
The first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: Ali Neffati from Tunisia. Neffati had been discovered by Tour organizer Henri Desgrange, and would later become a driver at "l'Auto", the newspaper that organised the Tour de France.
Race details.
In the first stages, not much happened in the overall classification, as most cyclists were saving their energy for the Pyrénées. The stage was won by Italian Giovanni Micheletto in a sprint. Micheletto was not part of the first group in the second stage, and thus lost his lead. There were four cyclists who had been in the lead group in both stages, and they were jointly leading the Tour.
The most important event occurred in the third stage, when former winner Lapize stopped the race because he considered his earning insufficient.
The crucial stage proved to be the sixth. At the start of the sixth stage, last year's winner Defraye lead the general classification, some 5 minutes ahead of Eugène Christophe. In that sixth stage, the first mountains were climbed. Defraye was dropped quickly, and Christophe lead the race. Christophe came up first on the Aubisque, and in second place behind Philippe Thys on the Tourmalet. On the way down from the Tourmalet, Christophe's fork broke, rendering his bike unusable, and the rules said that he had to repair it himself. He walked more than 10 km down to the next village, and found a place where he could repair his bicycle. He worked on it for over three hours, being watched by race officials who made sure that he was not helped by anyone. When Christophe asked a small boy to work the bellows, he was fined with ten minutes. After his bicycle was fixed, he rode away and finished the stage, 3 hours and 50 minutes later than the stage winner Thys. Christophe's chances to win the 1913 Tour de France were over.
After that sixth stage, Marcel Buysse was in the lead. In the ninth stage, Buysse had mechanical failure with a broken handlebar, and finished almost three and a half hours after stage winner Lambot. This was the end of the chances for Buysse for the victory. Buysse did not give up, and won four of the remaining five stages.
The lead had transferred to Thys now. In the last stages, the race focussed on the duel between Petit-Breton and Thys. In the 14th stage, Petit-Breton fell down and stopped the race. In the same stage, Thys also fell down and remained unconscious for a while. When he was conscious again, he was helped to repair his bicycle. All help was illegal in 1913, but the jury only gave him a 10 minute penalty. Thys finished the stage, and kept 8'37" in front of Gustave Garrigou in the general classification. In the final stage, Thys stayed with Garrigou, and so won the 1913 Tour de France.
Results.
General classification.
For each cyclist, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time after the last stage was the winner. Of the 140 starting cyclists, 25 finished.
Other classifications.
Camillo Bertarelli, ranked 8 in the general classification, became the winner of the "isolés" category. The "isolés" classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only the isolated cyclists (not part of a team) were eligible.
The organising newspaper l'Auto named Philippe Thys the "meilleur grimpeur". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.

He brings a golden glow to every session he partakes in, having abandoned amped up noise in favour of a much more introspective and calligraphic style of play." 
Around 2002 his music became increasingly abstract, all but eliminating melody and featuring extended periods of silence.
He has collaborated with other Japanese musicians involved in the Onkyo movement, such as Sachiko M, Toshimaru Nakamura and Otomo Yoshihide. He has also collaborated with musicians from European free improvisation scenes, notably trombonist Radu Malfatti and guitarist Keith Rowe.

Radika

The Radika (Macedonian and Serbian: , "Radika"; ) is a river in southern Kosovo and western Macedonia, a -long right tributary to the Black Drin river.
The Radika proper is long, but measured from the most distant source in its watershed, that of the Crni Kamen river, it is long.
Origin.
The Crni Kamen (Cyrillic: Црни Камен; "black stone"; Albanian 'Guri i zi') springs out from the northern slopes of the Vraca mountain, the southern extension of the Šar, Sharri Mountains, under the "Golema Vraca" peak (). The 'Guri i Zi' 'Crni Kamen' originally flows westward, through the Gora region, bends around the Vraca and sharply turns to the south and empties into the Kosovo-Macedonian border river Qafa e Kadies Ćafa Kadis (Serbian Cyrillic: Ћафа Кадис; Macedonian: Ќафа Кадис;).
The Ćafa Kadis originates from the southern slopes of the Vraca mountain and northern slopes of the Mangulova Kula mountain, another extension of the Šar Mountains. It flows westwards, on the northern section of the mountain of Ničipurska planina ("Brodec" peak, still part of the Šar massif) and for several kilometers forms the Kosovo-Macedonian border. After it receives the Crni Kamen from the right and another stream coming from Kosovo, the Ćafa Kadis turns south into the Macedonian proper again and from this point it is known as the Radika.
Upper Radika.
Upper Radika is just long and due to the human managing of its course, it belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage basin, unlike the latter course of the Lower Radika which belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin. It flows to the south between the mountains of Korab to the west and "Ničipurska planina" to the east. At the village of Volkovija, an artificial bifurcation is created, as the waters of the Upper Radika are conducted into the artificial lake Mavrovo at the village of Mavrovi Anovi and from there, via the Mavrovo system of the hydroelectric power plants, into the Vardar river (in this bifurcational flow, it even receives a tributary, small stream of "Beličica" from the right).
Lower Radika.
In the lower, -long section of the course, the Radika continues its general direction to the south. It carved a long and deep gorge between the mountains of Korab and Dešat on the west and Bistra (on the east). There are many interesting places along the Radika valley; including the villages of Velebrdo, RostušaRostushe, Jance, Prisojnica, Skudrinje, the Saint Jovan Bigorski Monastery, the spa of Kosovratska banja banjat e Kosovrastit(with sulphuric water, hot up to ) and the unique Alčija cave, formed in alabaster. Alabaster is abundant in the surrounding terrain and it has been extracted and treated for industrial and commercial use in the town of Debar.
After the gorge, the Radika receives its major tributary, the Valovica river from the right and flows on the northern slopes of the Stogovo mountain. After the villages of Dolno Kosovrasti, Dolni Melničani, Gorenci and Rajčica, the Radika empties into the Black Drin, just south of Debar Diber. The river Black Drin is one of tributaries of River Drin, while the next is White Drin that originate from Kosova. Actually, the lowest section of the river is floodbed by the artificial lake Debar on the Black Drin, becoming one of lake's bays.
Overall, the Radika belongs to the Adriac Sea drainage basin, drains an area of itself and it is not navigable.
The Radika has huge possibilities for the hydroelectric power production, which is partially used in its upper course. Also, the river valley is the natural route for the major road in Western Macedonia which connects the regions of Polog and Ohrid.

Fold-forming

Fold-forming is a technique of metalworking whereby metal is folded, repeatedly forged and annealed, and unfolded; at which stage it generally has a dramatic new three-dimensional form.
The technique was invented in the late 1980s by Charles Lewton-Brain, an English-born goldsmith who lived and studied in Tanzania, the United States, and Germany before moving to Canada. Outside of the Industrial Revolution, the method represents the first major innovation in metalworking in thousands of years. It can best be described as a combination of origami and traditional metalworking. By 1991, Lewton-Brain was winning awards for the technique and in 1997 workshops demonstrating the technique were at the core of the "Touch the Future" portion of the JCK International Jewelry Show in Orlando, Florida. 
Hundreds of folds have now been categorized, and techniques now include use of traditional forging tools, rolling mills, and embedding wire and other objects into the folds.

National Youth Choir of Scotland

The National Youth Choir of Scotland (NYCoS) was founded in 1996 as a flagship youth choir; its activities have since expanded to include four National Choirs: The National Youth Choir of Scotland, NYCoS Training Choir, National Boys Choir and National Girls Choir, in addition to 15 Area Choirs, a strong educational remit and a range of music publications, CDs and resources. There are over 2,500 young people across Scotland involved in NYCoS activities.
NYCoS is led by Artistic Director Christopher Bell, who has run the choir since its formation.
<br>They have sung numerous arrangements and original pieces by prolific Scottish and international composers including Eric Whitacre, Poulenc, Bernstein, Britten and Ken Johnston.
<br>Entry is by audition for singers aged 16 – 24 years. The basis of the choirs activities stem from a residential week in the summer, followed by concerts in Scottish cities. They have toured internationally to Sweden in 2001, Chicago in 2004, Hungary in 2007, and Germany in 2011. They performed at the BBC Proms in the Park in 2005 and 2007.
NYCoS Training Choir, formed in 1997 and currently directed by Michael Kibblewhite, gives singers aged 16 – 19 who need more experience (and perhaps time for their voices to develop) the opportunity to undertake challenging repertoire and have expert vocal and choral and individual coaching. Entry is by audition and the members of Training Choir share the residential course and some of the Scottish concerts with NYCoS.
The National Boys Choir was formed in 2002 and gives boys with unchanged and changed voices a unique opportunity to sing together to the highest standards. Entry is by audition and is open for boys aged 10 – 15. Structured in three sections, Junior Corps, NBC and Changed Voices, the choir meets annually around Easter time for a residential course, followed by concerts. The choir has performed in Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Linlithgow, Londonderry, Paisley and Stirling. In 2007, NBC toured to Kendal and Dumfries giving concerts in Kendal Town Hall and the beautiful Crichton Church in Dumfries.
The Choir has a varued repertoire including classical, sacred and Scots songs. Recent commissions include Tom Cunningham's "Saga of the Seven Days" and Sheena Phillips "Sea Shanties".
The National Girls Choir was formed in 2007. 80 young singers between the ages of 12 and 16 were selected by audition from all over Scotland. The daily timetable was the usual NYCoS mixture of high quality vocal coaching, musicianship training and full choir rehearsals. They performed their first concert to critical acclaim in the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh in April 2007. In 2010, the choir formed another section, the National Girls Training Choir. It offers girls who audition successfully, but whose voices are not quite ready for National Girls Choir, a chance to benefit from all that is offered by the National Girls Choir course.
In 1998 NYCoS formed two Children's Choirs (now known as Area Choirs), one in Livingston, West Lothian and one in Edinburgh. Each choir had approximately 60 members. Members were recruited from Primary 3 pupils (with some Primary 4 to make up numbers). Both choirs met for one hour each week and members received musicianship training for 30 minutes and sang as a choir for the remaining 30 minutes. At present there are 15 Area Choirs - Aberdeen, Angus, Dumfries, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Inverness, Isle of Lewis, Midlothian, Orkney, Perth, Renfrewshire, Stirling and West Lothian - with a membership of over 2,000 children. The set-up of the Area Choirs is still the same with members receiving musicianship training and singing as a choir. End of term concerts are given at Christmas and Summer.
NYCoS has a large educational remit and runs successful Kodály Musicianship Training weekends for teachers, choir directors and music specialists. They run in-service days and singing workshops for schools.
They also run Mini Music Makers classes across Scotland, which are musical sessions designed to introduce babies, toddlers and nursery age children and their parent/carer to the world of music.
NYCoS also produces a wide range of song books and educational resources.

Clan Guthrie

Clan Guthrie is a Scottish clan.
History.
Origins of the clan.
The family of Guthrie took their name from the lands of the same name in the county of Angus, Scotland and their name is one of the oldest in that county. The origin of the name Guthrie is not known, although there is a tradition that the lands were named Guthrie by an early king of Scots, after a fisherman "gut three" fish to serve his hungry monarch.
In about 1178 William the Lion granted the lands of Gutherin to Arbroath Abbey. The family were royal falconers and subsequently purchased these lands.
Wars of Scottish Independence.
The Laird of Guthrie was sent to France in 1299 to invite William Wallace to return to Scotland. The mission was successful and Guthrie landed with Wallace at Montrose, Angus. The early charters of the Guthrie family have since been lost but it seems certain that they obtained the Barony of Guthrie from David II of Scotland.
15th century.
In August 1442, Alexander Guthrie of Guthrie witnessed a charter by Alexander Seton, lord of Gordon to Lord Keith. He acquired the lands of Kincaldrum near Forfar in 1446 and became Baillie of Forfar. Sir David Guthrie of Guthrie was amour bearer to the king, captain of the guard and was appointed Lord Treasurer of Scotland in 1461. He also obtained a charter under the great seal to build Guthrie Castle in 1468 and in 1473 was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Scotland. David greatly increased the Guthrie estates and founded a collegiate church at Guthrie which was confirmed in a Papal bull of 1479.
16th century and clan conflicts.
David's son, Sir Alexander Guthrie, was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. In 1567 the Guthries signed a bond upholding the authority of the infant James VI of Scotland against that of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. Around the same time the Clan Guthrie were feuding with their neighbours, the Clan Gardyne. Alexander Guthrie had been assassinated at Inverpeffer and the Guthries retaliated. The feud lasted until 1618, when the Guthries were saved from their actions by a royal pardon.
17th century and civil war.
In the early seventeenth century the estate passed through cousins until 1636 when John Guthrie, Bishop of Moray became the eleventh chief of Clan Guthrie. Guthrie had been ordained at Perth and had become minister of St Giles in Edinburgh in 1621. He took up residence at Spynie Palace in 1623 and was consecrated Bishop of Moray. During the Scottish Civil War he was forced to surrender his castle to the forces of Colonel Monroe, retiring to his own estates in Guthrie. His third son, Andrew, fought for James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose but was captured at the Battle of Philiphaugh. Andrew was sentenced to death and beheaded by the Scottish "Maiden" in January 1646 in St Andrews. Andrew's daughter, Bethia, married a kinsman, Francis Guthrie of Gagie, and as a result the title and estates remained with the Guthrie family.
The Guthries were religious leaders in the time of Martin Luther and were champions of Presbyterianism against the Roman Catholic Church. They were ready to back up their beliefs with their lives and were true to their reputation of 'holding a sword in one hand, a Bible in the other'.
James Guthrie, who was of the chiefly family, was a Covenanter minister who became one of that movements early martyrs. He was ordained the minister of Lauder in 1638 and moved to Stirling in 1649. He preached openly against the king's religious policies and was stripped of his office by the Church of Scotland's General Assembly, whose authority Guthrie had challenged. He continued to preach until 1661 when he was sentenced to death and executed.
18th and 19th centuries.
A branch of the Clan Guthrie were the Guthries of Halkerton who held their barony by right of the office of royal falconers in Angus. However this title and office were only relinquished under the terms of the Heritable Jurisdictions Act in 1747.
John Douglas Guthrie of Guthrie served in the cavalry during the 1882 Egyptian campaign. He married Mary, daughter of Duncan Davidson of Tulloch.
Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Guthrie of Guthrie was the last chief of Clan Guthrie to live at Guthrie Castle. He was born in 1886, he became a distinguished soldier, commanding the 4th Battalion the Black Watch and was awarded the Military Cross.
The clan today.
Guthrie Castle was purchased by the Peña Family in 1984, and is now a venue for weddings, business meetings, and golf. There is an active fraternal organization, Clan Guthrie USA, dedicated to preserving and promoting Guthrie heritage.
Clan Chief.
The current chief is Alexander Guthrie of Guthrie 22nd of that Ilk, who inherited title from his grandmother Moira Guthrie of Guthrie. Educated in Italy and England, he attended UCL and now lives between Italy and the UK.
Clan Tartans.
Ancient (AKA Dress) Tartan 
A dark blue and green plaid with red/orange stripes.
Battle (AKA Weathered) Tartan 
The same pattern, but primarily brown and bluish gray with red striping.
Modern Tartan 
Follows the same pattern, but is primarily dark navy & dark green with red stripes.
Branches of Clan Guthrie.
Although the Guthries of Guthrie were the main line of the family, many offshoots existed, some of them mentioned in an old rhyme: "Guthrie o' Guthrie and Guthrie o' Gagie Guthrie o' Taybank an' Guthrie o' Craigie."
Clan Guthrie USA.
Clan Guthrie USA is a nonprofit, fraternal organization of over 400 Guthrie families who have joined together to promote and preserve their common heritage. The organization participates in Scottish Highland festivals, sells Guthrie merchandise, publishes a quarterly newsletter, sponsors special events (such as Scotland reunion tours), and maintains a Guthrie genealogy database.

Chuk Yuen

Chuk Yuen () or Chuk Un was a village and an area in New Kowloon of Hong Kong. The area located in the approximate area of present-day Wong Tai Sin. The name now also refers to two public housing estates, Chuk Yuen North and Chuk Yuen South Estates.
There is a village in proper Chuk Yuen at the junction of Shatin Pass Road and Lung Cheung Road.
History.
The original village of Chuk Yuen was centred approximately around the current Wong Tai Sin Fire Station, beside Shatin Pass Road. During early British rule of New Kowloon, Shatin Pass Road was a road from a point from Kai Tak Airport to Shatin Pass in the north ridge via villages of Po Kong and Chuk Yuen.
A forest of bamboo surrounded the village, and the village's name is derived therefrom - Chuk Yuen means "bamboo garden" in Chinese language. A river from the range north ran by the village west emptying into Kowloon Bay via Po Kong.
In 1921, a Taoist priest built Wong Tai Sin Temple west of the village, and a Taoist group Sik Sik Yuen (嗇色園) was established to manage the temple at the same time.
After World War II and the years around Chinese Civil War, large influx of refugees rushed into Hong Kong and built their home on the hill sides. Hong Kong Government zoned the hilly area north of the temple as Chuk Yuen Resettlement Area, which covered present-day Chuk Yuen North Estate, Chuk Yuen South Estate and Upper Wong Tai Sin Estate.
In 1956, the government decided to relocate the residents of squatters and Chuk Yuen Village in the resettlement area to a high-rise residential blocks. Two Wong Tai Sin Estates, "Upper" and "Lower", were built. A special block with better in-house facilities was constructed for indigenous villagers. 
Originally, the Wong Tai Sin temple was threatened as it was within the development project. However, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals successfully persuaded the government to preserve the temple.
The housing project of two Wong Tai Sin Estates were completed in early 1960s. The name of Wong Tai Sin gradually gains popularity over Chuk Yuen, though the temple continues to use the address of No. 2 Chuk Yuen Village.
Later, the northern part of the settlement area were replaced with the Chuk Yuen North and Chuk Yuen South estates. The Chuk Yuen Bus Terminus at Chuk Yuen Road, between two estates, hosts many bus routes to other areas of Hong Kong. 
Nowadays, Chuk Yuen commonly refers to the estates, the bus terminus, and surroundings.
Notable buildings.
The Salvation Army Chuk Yuen Corps was set up on June 261956, as a vocational centre for youngsters with a primary school for children. It was opened by the then Governor of Hong Kong Sir Alexander Grantham and about one hundred distinguished guests attended .

<doc id="5977173" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977173" title="Leyland National">
Leyland National

The Leyland National is a British single-deck bus manufactured in large quantities between 1972 and 1985. It was developed as a joint project between two UK nationalised industries - the National Bus Company and British Leyland. Buses were constructed at a specially built factory at the Lillyhall Industrial Estate, Workington. Styling was carried out by the famed Italian vehicle stylist Giovanni Michelotti, well known to British Leyland, having worked for both Triumph (Herald, TR4, GT6, 2000/2500, 1300, Dolomite and Stag) and Scammell lorries (Routeman GRP cab).
It was built with the intention to replace all the rear-engined single-deckers offered by British Leyland, including the AEC Swift, Bristol RE, single-deck Daimler Fleetline, Daimler Roadliner and Leyland Panther.
Design.
The Leyland National was built with integral, modular construction and a rear engine. All components were designed for ease of construction and replacement. Until 1978, it was always built with a distinctive roof mounted pod at the rear, housing the heating equipment, which consequently blew warm air out at roof level. At first the pod was almost the length of a bay and appeared designed to give a Trans-Atlantic feel. In 1976 a new shorter version of the roof pod was introduced along with the battery being relocated to the front under the cab. The Leyland National was available in two lengths, 10.3m and 11.3m. It was easy to spot the longer ones as its main side windows were all the same length, on the shorter models the windows were shorter except for one in the middle (where the exit doors were on dual door variants) which was the same length as on the longer models.
The Leyland National was a simple design: all parts could be replaced. Some operators, like London Transport, bought dual door models, and then later configured some of them to single door. This was helped by the design of the body, and the fact that parts were inter-changeable.
The earlier vehicles were only available in three colours - National Bus red, National Bus Green and White. At London Transport insistence, London bus red was added to the colour card, and their fleet eventually amounted to over 500 examples acquired between 1973 and 1980.
In 1978, Leyland brought out a simplified model (10351B/1R) with a revised interior that had minimal lighting and without the rear roof-mounted heating unit in previous models. Heating was under the seats, and was basic but effective. These vehicles were lighter, and this characteristic and the lower cost helped make extra sales. London Country bought quite a number of these, which other operators snapped up when London Country was broken up.
The National 2 was introduced in 1979. It differed from its predecessor mainly by having a wider choice of engines, along with a new nose moulding giving it a more bulbous look and a grille to cool the new front-mounted radiator, and a revised rear end with new lights and different engine door. 
Engines.
The Mark I Leyland Nationals had 8.3-litre straight-six turbocharged Leyland 510 "headless" diesel engines. The Leyland 510 engine had an unusual design, in that it featured non-detachable cylinder heads; any work on the valves required the crankshaft and pistons to be removed to enable access from the cylinder bore. This engine did not prove popular with all operators, being prone to poor fuel consumption and heavy smoking—especially if not maintained to high standards.
Some operators experimented with a different engine and found they could avoid the 510, which had the reputation of being a high maintenance unit and hard to work on.
Later on a simplified model (10351B/1R) was offered, with an engine that was reduced in power to stop it smoking. 
The National 2 was powered by initially the 0.680 engine then later the TL11, the Leyland 510 engine no longer being offered.
In 1981, a Gardner 6HLXB engine was experimentally installed in accident-damaged Eastern Counties LN600 (WVF 600S). This led to sister vehicle LN781 (DPW 781T) becoming the first operational Gardner-engined example which in turn paved the way for many engine conversions. Leyland were taken to court by Gardner for not offering their engine as an option in the fast selling National and as a result began to offer the Leyland National 2 with Gardner engines from 1982, initially the 6HLXB and later the 6HLXCT.
United Kingdom.
The bus quickly became a common sight on British roads. Although developed for the National Bus Company (whose subsidiaries effectively had to purchase it), it was also bought by the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, London Transport, SELNEC, Greater Manchester Transport, British Airways (which chose the 3 door version) and other operators.
Refurbishment.
In years to come, with all of the pressures created by deregulation, operators began refurbishing their Nationals for extended service, often retrofitting DAF or Volvo engines. The riveted body parts were easily replaced. In some cases a vehicle could be repaired and returned to service on the same day. All new parts were painted with grey primer so operators could paint to their requirements.
A more extreme approach was offered by East Lancashire Coachbuilders with their Greenway, that saw virtually everything other than the frame and axles replaced.
Exports.
The export version of the Leyland National was constructed in the standard way, although some were what might be called a hybrid, consisting of longer windows up to the rear axle and shorter ones after. This resulted in a 10.9 metre bus as opposed to either a 10.3 or 11.3 metre version.
Given the design it was very easy to produce left hand drive vehicles and these were used as a way of generating orders.
However, the Leyland National was not very successful in the export market - the largest export order of 450 was to Caracas, Venezuela in 1975/76. Around 125 Leyland Nationals were shipped to Kingston, Jamaica between 1972 and 1974 to be operated by the Jamaica Omnibus Service, a subsidiary of the British Electric Traction company. A shipment of 40 units was exported to Trinidad and Tobago for use by the National Bus Company.
Some examples were sold in the Netherlands but the problem with windscreen glare resulted in the windscreens being removed and a different version being fitted. No more were exported to the Netherlands. St Etienne Municipality in France also purchased 
In Australia, ACTION, Canberra purchased 70 Leyland Nationals between November 1974 and October 1975, 16 being fully assembled in the UK and 54 in Australia. The last were withdrawn from service in the early 1990s. Some were repowered with MAN engines. Brisbane City Council purchased seven in 1975 that were withdrawn in 1985. The Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board purchased 30 in 1975.
The Metropolitan Transport Trust, Tasmania purchased 63 in 1975/76 for use in Hobart. These were all 10.3 metre units, however one was rejected and its replacement was a 10.9 metre unit. Surfside Buslines, Tweed Heads were the largest Australian private bus operator with a fleet of 30 purchased new and second hand.
Replacement.
In all over 7,000 Leyland Nationals were built. It was replaced by the Leyland Lynx, although only around 1,060 were built.
Survivors.
Very few Nationals remain in service, the last major operator was Chase Bus Services, Chasetown who sold out to Arriva and who ceased full operations on 28 April 2007. Notably all but two retained Leyland 510s to the end. 
A large number of Leyland National buses have been preserved.
The Workington factory is now closed, though part of the building now forms part of the depot of Eddie Stobart.
Railbus derivatives.
In 1980s Leyland National bus components were also used to build the following classes of railbus for British Rail:
Despite the best intentions, the front end of the Leyland National was not considered substantial enough to allow for a standard bus front end to be used on train carriages. The body was very similar to a National, the components used were identical but the configuration was to a different format.
Articulated bus derivative.
In 1980, Danish subsidiary Leyland-DAB built some underfloor-engined articulated buses with bodywork derived from the Leyland National.

Fyllingen Fotball

Fyllingen Fotball was a Norwegian association football club from Fyllingsdalen, Bergen, Hordaland.
It was founded as a formally independent section of the alliance sports club Fyllingen IL on 1 January 1994. Fyllingen IL was founded on 6 June 1946. Fyllingen Fotball still uses Fyllingen IL's logo.
The club played in the Norwegian Premier League in 1991 and 1993, and reached the Norwegian Cup final in 1990, where they lost 5–1 against Rosenborg. This earned them a place in the 1991–92 European Cup Winners' Cup, where they were eliminated by Atlético Madrid in the first round.
Fyllingen played in the First Division from 1994 to 1996 and in the Second Division from 1997 till 2009. The last two seasons of its existence, the club played in the Third Division. After the 2011 season, Fyllingen merged with Løv-Ham to create FK Fyllingsdalen, and the two clubs ceased to exist.
Merger with Løv-Ham.
Løv-Ham had in the recent years taken over Fyllingen's spot as Fyllingsdalen's best football-club, but it was still Fyllingen that had the biggest support and the financial power in the borough. In the end of 2007, the two clubs started negotiation to merge the football-departments of the two clubs. If this had been a reality the goal was a budget of at least 15 million, a doubling compared to the Løv-Ham's budget in 2007. The aim was to create an organization and a name that create a stable state football team, and which in time also be able to play up in the Premier League. The experiment stranded when it was not achieved sufficient majority at the extraordinary annual meeting of Fyllingen. Four years later, on 28 September 2011, the members of both clubs' voted yes to a merge. The new club replaced Løv-Ham in the 2012 Norwegian Second Division, and the two old clubs will ceased to exist. Kjetil Knutsen became head coach of the new team.

Clay Cole

Clay Cole (January 1, 1938 – December 18, 2010) was an American host and disk jockey, best known for his eponymous television dance program, "The Clay Cole Show", which aired in New York City on WNTA-TV and WPIX-TV from 1959 to 1968.
Origins.
Clay Cole was born Albert Rucker, Jr., on January 1, 1938, in Youngstown, Ohio. He became a juvenile stage and radio actor; then in 1953, at age 15, became the television host and producer of his own Saturday night teen music show, "Rucker's Rumpus Room", first on WKBN-TV, then, until 1957, on WFMJ. Arriving in Manhattan in 1957, he worked first as an NBC page, then as a production assistant on the troubled quiz show Twenty One, the events at which were recreated in the 1994 film "Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford.
Early television and film career.
In 1958, he continued his Saturday night television legacy, launching "Al Rucker and the Seven Teens" program on WJAR-TV, Providence, Rhode Island. In New York City in 1959, when asked to change his name, he chose that of a distant cousin, Clay Cole. Clay's 1960 all-star ten-day Christmas show at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater broke the all-time house box office record. Clay was among the few white performers invited to appear at Harlem's Apollo Theater; he headlined three week-long revues, starring Fats Domino, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Chubby Checker. In 1961, he appeared as himself in the film "Twist Around the Clock." When WNTA-TV was sold in 1963, Cole's program was picked up by New York City television station WPIX-TV, where the program became known as "Clay Cole's Discotek" by 1965. During the 1960s "British Invasion", musical acts arriving from the UK often appeared on Cole's television show before doing network shows such as "The Ed Sullivan Show". The Rolling Stones and The Who were among those who first appeared on Cole's television show. Cole's show differed from "American Bandstand" in a few ways: while both Cole and Dick Clark had an interest in young people and their music, Cole did not hesitate to join in on his show's dance floor. He was also more confident about booking lesser-known performers and comedians for his show.
Writing, producing and directing career.
Leaving the "Clay Cole Show" in 1967, Clay became a television writer - producer, involved in the production of over 3500 broadcast television shows. He is twice winner of the Emmy Award (NATAS) as "producer of outstanding television programming" in 1981 and 1982 for the Joel Siegel Academy Awards special. He produced"The Discovery of Marilyn Monroe," "Play Bridge with Omar Sharif" and 365 "This Day In Hollywood" segments. Along with David Susskind and Raysa Bonow, he created and produced the first primetime entertainment magazine "People" for CBS in 1979. Cole also hosted "A. M. New York". He returned briefly in 1974 as the star of the first HBO-produced music special "Clay Cole's 20 Years of Rock and Roll," a two-hour event taped at Rockland Community College, and as co-host of the WABC-TV weekday program, "AM New York." His final professional assignment was as writer/producer/director of the television special, the 2002 Sanremo Music Festival in Italy, featuring Britney Spears, Destiny's Child, Alicia Keys, Shakira, Kylie Minogue and other international pop divas.
Retirement and death.
Cole retired and had been living on Oak Island since 2007, off the Cape Fear River on the North Carolina coastline. His pop culture memoir, "Sh-Boom! The Explosion of Rock 'n' Roll (1953-1968)", has been published by Morgan James. It has been nominated for the 2010 Association for Recorded Sound Collections Awards for Excellence in Historical Recorded Sound Research. Cole made a personal appearance at the annual Long Island Radio & TV Day in April 2010, and also at the New Jersey Rock Con later that year. Clay appeared at the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention in Newark, New Jersey in October 2010.
In addition, Cole was a member of the nominating committee of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.
Cole died of a heart attack at his home on December 18, 2010, at the age of 72.

USS Kangaroo (IX-121)

The second USS "Kangaroo" (IX-121), an "Armadillo"-class tanker designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the kangaroo, a family of herbivorous, leaping, marsupial mammals of Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent islands. Her keel was laid down as "Paul Tulane" under Maritime Commission contract (T. Z-ET1-S-C3) by Delta Shipbuilding Company, New Orleans, Louisiana, on 28 September 1943. She was renamed "Kangaroo" 27 October 1943, launched on 6 November 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Rufus C. Harris, acquired by the Navy on bareboat basis 17 December, and commissioned on 20 December with Lieutenant G. D. Lawson in command.
Following shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, "Kangaroo" departed Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on 24 January 1944, transited the Panama Canal on 28 January, and steamed to Noumea, New Caledonia, arriving 1 March. Assigned to the Service Force Pacific as a replacement for "Stag" (IX-128), she loaded fuel and supplies and departed for Guadalcanal on 21 March. Upon arrival 26 March, she commenced fueling operations, and for the next five months she replenishing ships in waters of the Solomon Islands.
Departing Tulagi on 10 September, she sailed to the Tonga Islands, received a cargo of fuel oil, and delivered her cargo at Noumea on 5 October. For seven months she served as a shuttle and station tanker, transporting bunker oil from the Fiji Islands and Tonga Islands to bases in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia. After a voyage to New Zealand for repairs, she departed Auckland on 6 June to load fuel oil at American Samoa. Subsequently, she conducted fueling operations in the Solomon Islands, Eniwetok, and the Western Caroline Islands before arriving Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 14 August to resume duty as a station tanker.
While in the Pacific "Kangaroo" steamed over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) and hauled more than 38,000,000 gallons (900,000 barrels, 144,000 cubic meters) of fuel oil and hundreds of drums of lubricating oil for fighting ships of the Navy. During her service she refueled more than 80 ships, including ten aircraft carriers, 34 destroyers, 20 troop transports, 12 cargo ships, and numerous merchantmen — not to mention storage barges, oilers, and tank farms.
"Kangaroo" departed Okinawa on 2 February 1946, for the United States. Transiting the Panama Canal on 9 March, she put into Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 April after a six-week anchorage at Lynnhaven Roads and Hampton Roads. "Kangaroo" decommissioned on 13 May, and the following day she was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal.

Athletics Kenya

Athletics Kenya (AK) is the governing body for the sport of athletics (track and field) in Kenya. It is a member of the IAAF and Confederation of African Athletics. AK organises athletics competitions held in Kenya. It also sends Kenyan teams to international championships. Isaiah Kiplagat is the current chairman of Athletics Kenya. AK is headquartered in "Riadha House", next to Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi.
History.
Athletics (track and field) in Kenya was governed by an organization known as Kenya Amateur Athletics Association (KAAA) from 1951 until 2002 when the organization changed the name to Athletics Kenya (AK). Arthur (Archie) Evans is credited for starting organized athletics and forming Kenya Amateur Athletics Association (KAAA) in 1951. Evans became the secretary of the newly formed KAAA and the late Sir Derek Erskine became its first chairman.
Kenya is a powerful nation in Athletics, but the talent is limited to long and middle distance running. Famous Kenyan runners typically come from districts like Keiyo, Marakwet and Nandi in western Kenya. Almost all of them represent Kalenjin tribes.
Kenyan Championships are held in summer, but separate trials are used to pick athletes for major international championships. Top Kenyan athletes usually attend these events, since those who skip them are likely miss major championships as well. Many leading Kenyan runners mostly compete in Europe, national championships and trials are the only event where local spectators can see them competing.
Other competitions organised by AK include series of track and cross-country meetings and number of road races. Kenya hosts three annual marathon events. Nairobi Marathon is the youngest, but is now leading in competitiveness and participation. Others are Mombasa Marathon and Great Lake Marathon, which is held in Kisumu. Additionally, there is a competition known as a Lewa Marathon, which involves races equal to full (42 km) and half marathon, but it is a cross-country race and thus cannot be classified as a marathon. Nevertheless, the half marathon event of Lewa Marathon has allured many Kenyan international runner and the event has been won by Paul Tergat, Catherine Ndereba and Joyce Chepchumba in recent years.
Many Kenyan runners are affiliated to governmental organisations like Armed Forces, Kenya Prisons or Kenya Police, which provide livelihood as well as training. In addition there are several private athletics clubs, like Mfae (based in Nyahururu) and Kiptenden (based in Kericho). 
Athletics Kenya operates an Athletics Museum in Riadha House, Nairobi. The museum was opened on November 1, 2006.
AK has been awarded the Kenyan Sports Federation of the Year award in 2006 2009 and 2010

<doc id="5977273" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977273" title="Ålgård FK">
Ålgård FK

Ålgård Fotballklubb is a Norwegian football club located in Ålgård founded in 1915. It currently plays in the Norwegian Second Division. Ålgård played in Hovedserien, then the highest division in Norway, for several years after World War II. The club has afterwards mainly been playing at the third highest level, and was last promoted to Second Division in 2002.
Ålgård is one of the largest football clubs in Rogaland in regarding to members and has many teams in the youth department. This has made it possible to produce enough talents to keep the club in the 2nd division. After Bryne FK was promoted to Norways highest division in 1975, many players have been transferred to the club from Jæren. Bryne lies only 16 km from Ålgård. Players like Birk Engstrøm, Kåre Sivertsen, Sverre Kristian Vaule, Rune Medalen, and Jørgen Rangnes have played for Bryne in the highest division. Engstrøm also have one cap for Norway.
The last players who have been transferred to larger clubs, have been Marius Helle (Bryne), Edwin Kjeldner (FC Lyn Oslo) and Robert Tveit (Sandnes Ulf). The clubs also have transferred women to Klepp IL like Sissel Grude and Dagny Mellgren. Mellgren scored Norways winning goal in the 2000 Summer Olympics Final.
History.
It was presumed that the club was founded in 1925, and the club celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1975. It was then known that the club was a bit older, but it was refounded 30 March 1925. After the 50th anniversary there was found a cup where the words "ÅFK 1915" was written. This is the only reason that the club today regards 1915 as its foundation.
The golden age.
Ålgård FK joined Rogaland Fotballkrets in 1928, and reached the final of the kretsmesterskapet (KM, "area championship") where they lost 5–2 for Jarl. The team was promoted to class A i 1936 when they won 2–1 against EIK in the qualification at Sandnes Idrettspark. Ålgård made themselves known in Norgesserien in 1938/39 and was leading after the matches in the autumn. In the end SIF won the championship after winning 1–0 against Ålgård in the last match of the season. Ålgård made their best effort in the cup ever in 1939, but finally lost against Drafn in Drammen in the 4th round.
Ravn Tollefsen moved to Ålgård in the 1930s to work as a policeman. He came from SIF and played for "kretslaget" (a team for the best players in area not regarding clubs). He was a natural leader and coach. There were many stories about how he used his position as policeman to watch the players behavior at parties Saturday night before matches. Many skillful players had to watch the match as a spectator when Tollefsen did not like what he saw. He made the players do their best, and it was a disciplined team. Ålgård also attracted players from Figgjo and had strong support from DFU which were a large and dominating company in the region. Ålgård got a lot of players which DFU hired in their factories. All this made the years between 1945 and 1950 Ålgårds golden age. The culmination came in 1948 when Sportsmanden ranked Ålgård as the seventh best club of Norway after a strong run in Hovedserien:
In 1949 Ålgård had to play all their home matches in Sandnes since DFU was expanding, and a new ground had to be built. The new ground was opened in September 1950. The opening match against Mjøndalen attracted 2000 attendants.
Decline.
The club celebrated their 25th anniversary in 1950, and had decided to make an impact, but struggled considerable. The club did not manage to get enough talents, even though Alf Ravndal made the team. It was the same players in the club who had played for many years. Gunnar Stensland and Sigurd Ravndal, two decent players, moved to Stavanger and joined Viking. Sverre Fredriksen became coach, but this was not enough, the club did not secure their place in Hovedserien and was relegated while they played their home matches in Sandnes. Ålgård reached the qualification for Hovedserien the next year, but Gjøvik-Lyn, Årstad and Snøgg were to strong. But Ålgård still attracted 2000 attendants against Årstad in Haugesund, even though Årstad is from Bergen.
Ålgård again reached the 3rd of the cup in 1951 and was once again drawn against Viking. The teams had played each other ten times after the war before this match. Ålgård had won five, Viking four and one draw. The match attracted 4500 attendants. After a 0–0 draw, a rematch had to be played, a match with 6000 attendants in Stavanger.
Before the season of 1951/52, 1st division became "Landsdelsserien". Ålgård ended this season as the last one, winning the league of Rogaland. Once again the club had reached the qualification. This time was Varegg from Bergen opponents in Haugesund. The match ended 2–2 in front of 2000 spectators. The decision finally came after extra time in the rematch, and Varegg could celebrate after winning 2–1.
Ålgård lost their first home match at the new ground in the autumn 1952, two years after the ground was opened, when Djerv 1919 won 2–1. ÅFK got nine out of ten points in the spring 1953, but the team had been too weak in the autumn, and was not able to win the league this year. The first of the "great" players from the end of the 1940s had retired, and new players were added. 1952/53 was a good year for the team, the last time the team had scored as many goals was in 1947, but the economy was bad. The team was going to put this straight in the cup, and after an easy win against Klepp, the team was drawn against Donn in Kristiansand. But Ålgård surprisingly lost, and the club missed an income of several thousands kroner.
The next season was disappointing, but 1955 was considerable better. The team reached 3rd round of the cup and SK Brann visited Ålgård. But Ålgård was unable to repeat the achievement from 1946, and lost 6–2. The club was relegated from Landsdelsserien in the spring of 1955, but was back in 1957. But the season of 1957/58 became the last one in Landsdelsserien. After the league system was remade in 1961, Ålgård has never been higher than the third highest division. 1958 is remembered for the 1st round cup match against Viking, where a controversial decision by the referee in the end gave Viking a 3–2 victory after extra time. Jørgen Madland, the Ålgård goalkeeper, turned while he had the ball in his hands, and the referee decided that the ball had crossed the goal line. The referee had to be protected as he went to the dressing room after the match, as angry Ålgård players meant that the ball could not have crossed the line.
1957/58 became Ålgårds weakest season until then, and the club did not qualify for the cup for the first time in 1959. Ålgårds under-19s team won KM in 1956, but many of these players left the club or could not strengthen the team.
4th division.
In the beginning of the 1960s, ÅFK was struggling in the 4th division. But even though their results were poor, many youths made the team, which would make a positive impact. In 1964 the tide changed, and players who played many games earlier, lifted Ålgård to a great season. Buøy IL became to strong in the qualification in the end, but the team only lost one game in the league. 1964 was the best season in many years, since other teams in the club also had a good season.
The famous footballer Reidar Kvammen was appointed coach the next year aside Alf Ravndal. The results did not change significantly from the earlier years in the beginning of the 60s, but the club won KM in under-19s and under-16s. The club had many decent talents, but the club was not able support them. Marvin Skjæveland was one of the most promising players, but he left ÅFK for Ulf.
The club was promoted to 3rd division in 1966 after nine consecutive seasons in 4th division. It was no surprise, as Rogalands Avis expressed:
The first ever Ålgård-player got a cap for a Norwegian national youth team when Birk Engstrøm appeared in a Nordic tournament in Finland. He transferred to Bryne later the same year, which caused reactions among the elder members of the club.
The club had great expectations for playing in the 3rd division in 1967, especially after Vålerenga was beaten with their best players at Ålgård in a friendly match before the season started. But the season brought loss upon loss, and the club dived straight back to 4th division.
A new era.
1969 became an important year by two reasons. The new pitch was finished at Ålgård stadion, and November brought changes in the club. Young inexperienced leaders took almost total control over the general assembly and got the most important positions in the club. A new era started with a new generation leaders whom introduced objectives. Elderly ÅFK-members were disappointed and expected everything to go from bad to worse. The club was not promoted this year, but the club was in motion. The new leaders made the foundations for growth both in the economy and on the pitch, in quality and quantity, which gave results in the 70s and which made the foundation for today's club. The club hired a manager full-time in 1970, and the club was promoted to 3rd division again.
ÅFK avoided relegation in 1971 and 1972, but the club struggled. The clubhouse was built in 1972 after many years of planning and was opened 21 March 1973. In 1973 women were given voting rights in the club, and the club had their first female officials.
Ålgård was relegated in 1972, and was almost promoted the next year. It got especially heated when Djerv 1919 visited Ålgård. Djerv was up by 2–0 with only a couple of minutes to go, but the match ended by a 3–2 win for Ålgård. The players from Haugesund attacked the referee after the match, and the local police officer had to restore order. Several fines were given after the match. In the end Fartbutt 1919 won the promotion.
The next year became victorious when the club finally promoted after qualification against Odda and Flekkefjord, the same year the club celebrated their 50th anniversary. The team could not meet the expectations the following year, but was back in 3rd division only one year later. The club had an excellent youth team with players which would make an impact on the club in the years to come, like Peder Skårland, Gaute Engstrøm and Kåre Sivertsen. In addition, Sverre Kristian Vaule made the team.
The club managed to avoid relegation with Trond Tengesdal as manager. Before Tengesdal took charge, the club had a committee which picked the team for matches. This committee usually consisted of three persons. With Tengesdal this committee was removed, and the manager picked the team himself. The club got its second national player when Lars Hovland made his debut at Norways Under-16.
1979 was the last season where 3rd division had a league with only teams from Rogaland. Only the top five teams would qualify for the following years 3rd division. But Ålgård made a fine 2nd place which was far better than expected.
1980s.
Sivertsen transferred to Bryne in 1980, and the team was struggling before the summer break. ÅFK was the favorite for relegation, but Ålgård finally got their first home win in the end of August with 6–0 against Sandviken. The club ended at 6th place in the end of the season.
1981 brought a fine cup season with 1–0 against Ulf. The team had reached 2nd round for the first time in 13 years. Extra time divided Ålgård and Viking after Ålgård took the lead at Ålgård stadion. Viking won 3–2 after extra time. Gaute Engstrøm transferred to Bryne in the summer, which caused concern in the club, while Sivertsen returned injured from Bryne. Ålgård had in 1981 for the first time a team for girls, a youth team, whom won their division and Vidar Cup.
Again a slow start made Ålgård struggling in 1983, and in the summer the board chose to get a new manager to the club. The struggle for continued play in the 3rd division continued to the last game, but Ålgård was relegated. The team improved the next season and lost only one game, home against Figgjo IL. Figgjo won 3–1, led by Bjarne Berntsen. Ålgård finished 2nd behind Figgjo as they drew more than Figgjo.
1985 became one of the worst seasons in ÅFKs history. The team did not win a single match from 11 May to 23 August. In the end the team reached 9th place, only three goals ahead of Hovsherad who were relegated to 5th division. The club lost several players before the season of 1986, but Jan Erik Aunevik was back from military service and young promising Rune Medalen was promoted to the senior squad. Ålgård won 4th division by a ten points gap to Sola FK og won the regional championship through defeating Åkra 1–0 at Karmøy and 2–2 at home.
In five years the club had doubled its activities and had 28 teams which played 709 matches in 1988. The "Match of the Century" this year away against Figgjo drew a lot of attention, a match ÅFK surprisingly won 2–1. Figgjo later got their revenge at Ålgård stadion by a late goal. Ålgård became 6th in their first season in 3rd division. 1989 became ÅFKs best season in the 80s. Among the new players were Nils Ove Hellvik and Jørgen Rangnes. The team used three goalkeepers as their first choice in 1989, first Roger Årdal from Hana, then Øyvind Bjelland from Oltedal and finally U-19s Einar Fjeldheim. Ålgård ended in 3rd place.
2nd division.
The club remained at the 3rd level of Norwegian football from 1988 through twelve consecutive seasons before the club ended last in 1999. Ålgård lost many players to other teams in the 90s, Rune Medalen (Viking), Jørgen Rangnes (Bryne), Pål Endre Oftedal (Bryne), Tord Oftedal (Bryne), Arne Eigil Aksnes (Bryne), Odd Arne Tjåland (Bryne) and Knut Terje Stava (Sandnes) among others. But the team won 3rd division in their first season, became regional champions, but lost qualification matches against FK Jerv and Sandnes Ulf. Ålgård was promoted after defeating Vaulen IL in 2002, 6–2 at home and 2–2 away in Stavanger. Following the promotion the club has many times struggled against relegation, but has so far secured their place in 2nd division.
Helge Aune got a bad start in the season of 2005. After playing half the games, Ålgård only had seven points and needed badly a win against local rival EIK. Ålgård got former ÅFK-player Espen Sola on loan from Bryne, and Kim Cassim made a comeback from the reserve team. The club needed a win to have a chance of remaining in 2nd division, but was trashed 4–0 in Egersund. But Ålgård got ten points in the next four games and ended in 6th place at 35 points. Ålgård was the best club of the division in the autumn, while EIK was relegated to 3rd division.
Egil Svendsen became new manager in 2006, and the season started like the previous ended, ÅFK made a good start. The team stayed for a while at second place, but ended in a new 6th place. They claimed 38 points, best result since 1994. Striker Marius Helle transferred to Bryne halfway through the season and was replaced by Geir Tharaldsen from SK Nord.
2007–.
Tommy Bergersen replaced Svendsen as manager in 2007. He came from Bryne where he had to retire due to injuries. Eirik Sanne, Tharaldsen, Gustav Kjølberg and Ingve Aarrestad left the club, while Håkon Eikrem and Arnt Ove Ivesdal transferred from Bjerkreim, Jan Tore Lende Fadnes from Bryne and Espen Skogen from EIK. In the summer break the team was strengthened by Geir Andre Herrem and Oddgeir Salte from Bryne on loan for the remaining part of the season.
Ålgård got a weak start of the season 2007 through defeats by relegation contenders Askøy and Os, but managed to defeat Fana IL at home. ÅFK was helpless against a strong Viking 2. Bergersen protested in Stavanger Aftenblad later in the season against what he and SIF manager Cato A. Hansen felt were destructive use of players after Viking 2 in several matches used their youth team in some matches and strong teams in others.
The club surprised against relegated Manglerud Star and fought a draw at home, then managed to win an important victory away at Fyllingen after a late goal by Rogvi Baldvinsson. The team needed a victory home against FK Arendal, but things looked lost at half time when Arendal were two up after goals by Geir Tungesvik and former Odd Grenland Armin Sistek. The team did not give in and Urstad headed ÅFK back into the game after only three minutes of second half. Eikrem was sent up the field as striker aside Skogen and equalized only two minutes after Urstads goal. The match was finally turned when Sivertsen six minutes later curled the ball passed Arendals goalkeeper after getting a freekick just outside the penalty area.
No goals were scored in the next two matches, but drew against Vard Haugesund before winning 2–0 away at Åsane. ÅFK then lost 4–1 in a friendly match against Luton Town at Ålgård stadion where the team was reinforced by SIF-players Cato A. Hansen and Rolf Magne Olsen.
Fall started with nine points in four games, followed by two points in the three next. The last six games were lost. Things was not better in other relegation battling teams, except for Åsane who fought their way back from being hopelessly lost to getting a last chance against Ålgård in the last match of the season. If winning by two goals Åsane would stay while Ålgård was relegated. ÅFK got many chances to finish Åsanes hope early on, but Åsane still managed to take the lead in first half and went two up with only ten minutes to go. Ålgård was as good as relegated. Two minutes before full time, Jonas Vølstad Fjeldsbø got a freekick at the edge of the penalty area by the goal line. Oddbjørn Sivertsen struck the ball into the box where Baldvinsson headed the ball down to the feet of Håvard Urstad who forced the ball over the line. Ålgård had avoided relegation.
After the season ended, Ålgård was left with 11 players from 2007, and the club started building a new team. ÅFK got Joakim Bjordal (from reserves), Stein Morten Hansen (Flekkefjord), Henrik Karlsen (Hana), Alexander Idland (Buøy) and Bård Tommy Karstensen (Sandnes Ulf) as replacements for players like Robert Tveit (Sandnes Ulf), Eikrem, Sivertsen (retired), Høvring and Lende Fadnes. Later Geir André Herrem returned through loan from Bryne after first joining SIF. Goalkeeper Ole Fredrik Bergseth was also lost. Commotion followed the clubs attempt to get Ole Gunnar Solskjær to the club.

River Dour, Kent

The River Dour is a river in the county of Kent, in England. It flows from the villages of Temple Ewell and River, through the village of Kearsney, to Dover. It is roughly 4 km long. 
It originally had a wide estuary on the site of modern Dover, although today it flows into the Dover Harbour through a culvert. The estuary was a natural harbour for the Bronze Age settlers and traders in the area. The remains of a Bronze Age seagoing boat (from 3,500 years ago), was found in 1992, and it can be seen in Dover Museum. 
The Dour Estuary was then used as a port for the Roman town,as a natural harbour for the Roman fleet.
But this was silted up in the medieval period, necessitating the construction of various artificial harbours for Dover instead.
The river has been used since AD 762 to power various watermills along its route. These included 8 Corn Mills and 5 paper mills. Buckland Mill (near Buckland Bridge) was one of the first corn mills, it has now been converted into flats. Crabble Mill (is now a restaurant), Old Mill (in Kearsney - is now a private house) and others (also converted into various uses). 
Other industries on the river included, iron foundries, saw mills (demolished) and a tannery (also converted).
Kearsney, Kent and Kearsney Abbey (a former Grand House) is also beside the River. 
The River Dour Trail is a new walking trail (set up by the White Cliffs Countryside Project). It follows the Dour from Temple Ewell to Wellington Dock on the seafront.
The trail is about 4miles long and takes 2.5 hours to walk fully.

Tetrahedral prism

In geometry, a tetrahedral prism is a convex uniform polychoron (four-dimensional polytope). This polychoron has 6 polyhedral cells: 2 tetrahedra connected by 4 triangular prisms. It has 14 faces: 8 triangular and 6 square. It has 16 edges and 8 vertices.
It is one of 18 uniform polyhedral prisms created by using uniform prisms to connect pairs of parallel Platonic solids and Archimedean solids.
Structure.
The tetrahedral prism is bounded by two tetrahedra and four triangular prisms. The triangular prisms are joined to each other via their square faces, and are joined to the two tetrahedra via their triangular faces.
Projections.
The tetrahedron-first orthographic projection of the tetrahedral prism into 3D space has a tetrahedral projection envelope. Both tetrahedral cells project onto this tetrahedron, while the triangular prisms project to its faces.
The triangular-prism-first orthographic projection of the tetrahedral prism into 3D space has a projection envelope in the shape of a triangular prism. The two tetrahedral cells are projected onto the triangular ends of the prism, each with a vertex that projects to the center of the respective triangular face. An edge connects these two vertices through the center of the projection. The prism may be divided into three non-uniform triangular prisms that meet at this edge; these 3 volumes correspond with the images of three of the four triangular prismic cells. The last triangular prismic cell projects onto the entire projection envelope.
The edge-first orthographic projection of the tetrahedral prism into 3D space is identical to its triangular-prism-first parallel projection.
The square-face-first orthographic projection of the tetrahedral prism into 3D space has a cubical envelope (see diagram). Each triangular prismic cell projects onto half of the cubical volume, forming two pairs of overlapping images. The tetrahedral cells project onto the top and bottom faces of the cube.
Related polytopes.
It is the first in an infinite series of uniform antiprismatic prisms.
The tetrahedral prism, -131, is first in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes, expressed by Coxeter as k31 series. The tetrahedral prism is the vertex figure for the second, the rectified 5-simplex. The fifth figure is a Euclidean honeycomb, 331, and the final is a noncompact hyperbolic honeycomb, 431. Each uniform polytope in the sequence is the vertex figure of the next.

The Heroic Age of American Invention

The Heroic Age of American Invention is a 1961 science book for children by L. Sprague de Camp, published by Doubleday. It was reprinted in 1993 by Barnes & Noble under the title "Heroes of American Invention".
By "heroic age" the author means the era of American history in which individual initiative and enterprise constituted the primary thread in technical innovation, roughly from the early 19th century until mass production and corporate enterprise outpaced that of the individual aroung the time of World War I. The story of innovation is told through the biographies and inventions of thirty-two key inventors of the United States' industrial revolution, whom de Camp feels were pivotal in converting the country from an agrarian nation to an industrial one.
Some of the inventors spotlighted include Robert L. Stevens, George Westinghouse, Samuel Morris, Samuel Colt, Cyrus McCormick, Alexander Graham Bell, and Thomas Edison.

Ralph Adimari

Ralph T. Adimari (1902 – 1970) was an editor, researcher, and historian of the dime novel, a class of popular fiction that thrived in the mid to late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. The term "dime novels" refers to inexpensive, cheaply produced paperbacks and serials, often romance, adventure, westerns, or detective stories. 
Life.
A prodigious collector, Adimari did extensive research on dime novels, and published many articles in "Dime Novel Round-Up" before 1940, and at least 20 articles between 1954 and 1964. He also wrote a piece titled "Saga of a Dime Novelist" which appeared in "American Book Collector" in early 1935. Through correspondence with fellow dime novel historian and "Dime Novel Round-Up" editor Ralph F. Cummings, Adimari acquired the letters and notebooks of William J. Benners (1863-1940), a dime novel historian, author, and agent, and wrote a biography of Benners for the "DNRU". Building upon Benners's work identifying dime novel authors, Adimari compiled detailed lists of authors and pseudonyms, titles, and publishers, definitively solving several mysteries about dime novel authorship.
Adimari was born Raphael Adimare on October 19, 1902. He lived in the New York City area for most of his life, including Mount Vernon and Suffolk. In addition to his work on dime novels, he co-edited a 1936 collection of Walt Whitman's essays, titled "New York Dissected". Adimari died November 1970 in Suffolk, New York. 
The Ralph Adimari Papers are housed in the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University's Bobst Library. The papers comprise correspondence from fellow dime novel collectors and historians, including Edward G. Levy, Dr. Albert Johannsen, "Dime Novel Round-Up" editors Edward T. LeBlanc and Ralph Cummings, the latter from whom Adimari acquired William Benners's papers, and writers including Col. Charles D. Randolph, aka "Buckskin Bill," known for his dime-novel and Western themed poetry. Also included are notebooks of research, manuscripts, newspaper clippings related to dime novel authors, photographs, and Victoriana. The William J. Benners Papers, also housed in Fales, includes several of Benners's notebooks that were subsequently used and annotated by Adimari.

Karlsruhe Institute of Technology

The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is one of the largest and most prestigious research and education institutions in Germany. It was created in 2009 when the University of Karlsruhe ("Universität Karlsruhe"), founded in 1825 as public research university and also known as "Fridericiana", merged with the Karlsruhe Research Centre (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe), which was originally established as a national nuclear research centre (Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, or KfK) in 1956.
KIT is one of the leading universities in the Engineering and Natural Sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact. KIT is a member of the TU9 German Institutes of Technology e.V. As part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative KIT was accredited with the excellence status in 2006. In the 2011 performance ranking of scientific papers, Karlsruhe ranked first in Germany and among the top ten universities in Europe in engineering and natural sciences.
In the 2013 QS World University Rankings the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology achieved 116th place in the global ranking across all disciplines and 33rd and 34th place in engineering and natural sciences, respectively. In the 2013 Taiwan ranking, KIT (world rank 61) remained the best German University in the engineering and natural sciences, ranked in the engineering sciences ahead of the RWTH Aachen (world rank 89), the Technical University of Munich (world rank 94) and the Technical University of Dresden (world rank 108). For the natural sciences KIT (world rank 51) led the domestic comparison against the LMU Munich (world rank 62), the University of Heidelberg (world rank 72) and the Technical University of Munich (world rank 81).
Historical background.
The University of Karlsruhe was founded as "Polytechnische Schule", a polytechnical school, on 7 October 1825. It was modelled upon the École polytechnique in Paris. In 1865, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden raised the school to the status of a "Hochschule", an institution of higher education. Since 1902 the university has also been known as the "Fridericiana" in his honour. In 1885, it was declared a "Technische Hochschule", or institute of technology, and in 1967 it became an "Universität", a full university, which gave it the right to award regular doctorate degrees. It had hitherto only been allowed to award doctorates in engineering, identified as "Dr. Ing", a right bestowed on all technical institutes in 1899. 
The University of Karlsruhe has been one of the leading German institutions in computer science. A central computer laboratory was founded in 1966. The department of informatics was established three years later, along with the first regular course in informatics. On 2 August 1984, the university received Germany's first email. The Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research) was founded at the university in 1985.
The university also cooperated extensively with the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Research Centre), and this relationship was formalised on 6 April 2006 when Professor Horst Hippler and Dr. Dieter Ertmann from the University of Karlsruhe, and Professor Manfred Popp and Assistant Jur. Sigurd Lettow from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe signed a contract for the foundation of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The name was chosen in emulation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the leading technical university in the United States. In February 2008, the merger of the university and the research centre to form KIT was agreed by the state of Baden-Württemberg and Germany's federal government. The necessary state law was passed on 8 July 2009. KIT was formally established on 1 October 2009.
The main reason for establishing KIT was to strengthen Karlsruhe's position in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, which offered elite universities grants of up to 50 million euros per annum. This aim was not achieved: while the University of Karlsruhe was chosen for the initiative in 2006/2007, KIT failed to secure a place in 2012. It did, however, attract funds from other sources. In 2008, Hans-Werner Hector, co-founder of SAP, raised 200 million euros to support researchers at the institute. (Hector is the only founder of SAP who did not graduate from the University of Karlsruhe; he was given an honorary doctorate for his support of intellectually gifted children in 2003.)
Admission and education.
Since the winter semester of 2008/2009, KIT has completed the change from the Diplom system to a bachelor and master system. Students already enrolled for a diplom degree when the transition began were allowed to finish their studies, but new students are only allowed to apply for a bachelor or master degree.
Admission policies differ between departments. While students are chosen by the quality of their school degree and their extracurricular activities for courses such as industrial engineering and management (27 per cent of admissions in 2008), other departments do not preselect for their courses, including physics, informatics, and meteorology. All courses require a minimum number of passed exams, called Orientierungsprüfung or orientation assessment, in the first three semesters before students are allowed to complete their course. There is a substantial drop-out rate for some engineering courses due to the immense study requirement in order to pass the pre-requisites.
In the first semesters of a course, education tends to be theoretically oriented at KIT, with a high concentration of mathematics for engineering and natural science courses. It is possible to choose between practical and theoretical topics in later semesters.
Interdisciplinary education and research.
The university allows a broad range of education with the possibility of cross studies and work. The studium generale (English: general studies) was established in 1949, allowing students to attend lectures not directly pertaining their study field.
The Zentrum für Angewandte Kulturwissenschaft und Studium Generale (Centre for Applied Culture and General Studies) was founded in 1989 to support the students as a central institution for their interdisciplinary study. Nowadays it offers specialised qualifications in the fields of "Leadership and Entrepreneurship", "Media - Culture - Communication", "Internationalisation and intercultural decision-making and responsibility", "Diversity Management", "European Integration and Identity Studies", as well as the classical studium generale. A possibility for a concomitant study in applied culture science is given as well.
In 1979, the Interfakultatives Institut für Anwendungen der Informatik (Interfaculty Institute for Applications of Informatics) was founded. It brings together research in physics, mathematics, and engineering based on computer science. Its mathematical pendant is the Institut für Wissenschaftliches Rechnen und Mathematische Modellbildung (Institute for Scientific Calculations and Mathematical Modelling). Its aim is to enhance the exchange between mathematics and engineering in the fields of scientific calculations.
The Interfakultatives Institut für Entrepreneurship (Interfaculty Institute for Entrepreneurship) was established by SAP funding. Its teaching professors were entrepreneurs on their own. Before being shut down in 2010 the former professor was Götz Werner, founder of dm-drogerie markt.
In 2001, the Centre for Functional Nanostructures (CFN) was established. It merges the fields of material sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics which are related to nano technology. The CFN is one of the three Exzellenzzentren (English: Excellence Instituitions) of the University of Karlsruhe. Another interdisciplinary institution is the Centre for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM).
The Karlsruhe School of Optics and Photonics (KSOP) was established in 2006 as a publicly funded project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under the German Universities Excellence Initiative. KSOP was the first graduate school at the University of Karlsruhe and covers photonic materials and devices, advanced spectroscopy, biomedical photonics, optical systems and solar energy. It is supported by several institutes and professors of the university. It is also a partner in the EUROPHOTONICS consortium, which provides scholarship for master's degrees and PhD under the European Commission's prestigious Erasmus Mundus cooperation and mobility program.
Reputation.
KIT is one of the leading universities in the Engineering and Natural Sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact. KIT is a member of the TU9 German Institutes of Technology e.V. As part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative KIT was accredited with the excellence status in 2006. In the 2011 performance ranking of scientific papers, Karlsruhe ranked first in Germany and among the top ten universities in Europe in engineering and natural sciences.
In the 2013 QS World University Rankings the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology achieved 116th place in the global ranking across all disciplines and 33rd place in the engineering sciences. In the 2013 Taiwan ranking, KIT leads as best German University in the engineering and natural sciences. As in 2012, KIT (world rank 61) remained ranked as the top University for engineering sciences in Germany, before the RWTH Aachen (world rank 89), the Technical University of Munich ( world rank 94) and the Technical University of Dresden (world rank 108). For the natural sciences KIT (world rank 51) leads the domestic comparison against the LMU Munich (world rank 62), the University of Heidelberg (world rank 72) and the Technical University of Munich (world rank 81).
According to the Ranking of Scientific Impact of Leading European Research Universities, an official document compiled by the European Commission, Karlsruhe ranks 2nd nationally and 6th in Europe in terms of scholarly impact.
With the exception of the department of biology, this university receives more funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft than any other university specializing in the natural sciences in Germany. In the engineering sciences (Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering), the university is in the top three together with University of Stuttgart and the RWTH Aachen. It also consistently ranks top in the course industrial engineering and management, concerning the overall study situation as well as popularity with employers.
More than 20% of its students are attracted from other nations and 0.6% of its students receive grants from the German Studienstiftung (German National Academic Foundation). In 1998, ScienceWatch ranked its chemistry faculty as belonging to "the cream of the crop in chemistry" internationally.
In 2006, the University of Karlsruhe was chosen to be one of the first three universities with the best future concept within the scope of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. These universities have been called "elite universities" in general public and media from that day on.
For many years the department for Computer Science has been the number one institution in this field in Germany. Hence, the University of Karlsruhe has established international reputation.
In the 2013 QS World University Rankings the university was ranked 116th in the world. Its subject rankings were 33rd in Engineering and Technology and 34th in Natural Sciences.
It was ranked 13th in the world for Mechanical Engineering by the Taiwan Rankings.
In the 2012 Times Higher Education World University Rankings the university was ranked 151st in the world.
Campus Nord.
The "Campus Nord" (English: Campus North), the former "Forschungszentrum" was founded in 1956 as "Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK)" (Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre). Initial activities concentrated around the Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2), the first nuclear reactor built by Germany. With the decline of nuclear energy activities in Germany, Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe directed its work increasingly towards alternative areas of basic and applied sciences. This change is reflected in the change of name from "Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe" to "Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe" with the subheading
"Technik und Umwelt" (technology and environment) in 1995. This subheading was replaced by "in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft" in 2002.
The Campus Nord is the site of the main German national nuclear engineering research centre and the Institute for Transuranium Elements. Also present on the site is a nanotechnology research centre and the neutrino experiment KATRIN.
There is further a 200 metre tall guyed mast for meteorological measurements at Campus Nord.
Computer facilities.
The Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC), named after Karl Steinbuch, is the institution which was formed in 2008 out of the merging process between the main computer facilities of the University of Karlsruhe and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. It is responsible for the university's IP connectivity and provides central services (Mail, Web, Campus management) for students and employees. It supplies students with 10 fully equipped computer rooms, one professional print office and a wireless network over the whole campus area. Some departments, like computer science, physics, and mathematics, run their own computer rooms as well.
The SCC runs some of the fastest computers in Germany:
On 2 August 1984, Michael Rotert, a research fellow at University of Karlsruhe, received the first email ever sent to Germany, at his address "rotert%germany@csnet-relay.csnet".
GridKa runs the Rocks Cluster Distribution Linux distribution for supercomputers.
Libraries.
The KIT Library is the main library of KIT. Its two branches on Campus South and Campus North provide literature for research and study for about 25,000 students and 8000 scientists with a widespread, interdisciplinary book stock of over 2 million volumes, reports and 28,000 periodicals in print and electronic form. The emphasis of the collection lies on natural and engineering sciences.
The 24-hour library at Campus South was extended in 2006. It became a 24-hour library with many working places and a relaxing area, and is now open around the clock. The combination of a special book security system and an automated issue desk make it possible to use the 1000 workplaces anytime, day or night. Current and contemporary literature is freely accessible in the four specialised reading rooms. Each reading room provides cross-linked, modern and well-equipped study and work stations as well as printers, scanners and copy machines.
The research library at Campus North provides a large specialised book stock (especially reports and primary reports) on energy and nuclear energy. The complete literature is freely accessible to the user. Thirty modern workplaces, as well as printers, scanners, copy machines and cubicles for individual work are available.
Additional literature is located in the two specialised reading rooms for chemistry and physics, as well as in the Library of the University of Applied Sciences at Campus Moltkestrasse, which is administrated by the KIT Library. The faculty of physics, the faculty of mathematics, the faculty of computer science and the faculty of economics and management have got their own libraries to supply students and researchers with topic related literature.
Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE).
The CIE is an entrepreneurial driven platform for students, scientist and alumni of the KIT and the region Karlsruhe who are interested in starting a business. The CIE platform is developing towards an entrepreneur club where entrepreneurs support each other to raise successful businesses. Prospective entrepreneurs seek advise from the very first idea, how to develop business concepts and how to find co-workers.
Founded in 2008 by two alumni of the KIT, the CIE offers a wide portfolio of services including consulting and concept development. The CIE also provides facilities like a StartUp-office where new entrepreneur teams can work on their ideas. All services are for free. Entrepreneurs who benefit from the active club are asked to support the CIE financially and with own services.
As a project of the KIT, the CIE receives financial support from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and the European Social Fund.
Faculties.
The university has eleven faculties:
Many departments cooperate, some are shared with the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe.

Örjan Persson

Per Örjan Persson (27 August 1942 in Uddevalla, brought up in Smögen) is a former Swedish football player probably most famous for playing for Scottish clubs Dundee United and later Rangers in the 1960s. He also represented Sweden at the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico and the European Championship in 1964.
Persson was the first of five Scandinavian imports signed by Dundee United manager Jerry Kerr who was one of the first managers in Scotland to tap into the Scandinavian market to find talented and experienced players at an affordable price. Persson moved to Tannadice from Örgryte IS on 2 December 1964, the first overseas player to join the club. As there was no professionalism in Swedish football in the 1960s United did not have to pay a transfer fee. He made his debut along with the Danish striker Finn Døssing. United had made a poor start to the 1964-65 First Division season and appeared to be heading towards relegation, which would have undone the great work done by Kerr since leading the team to promotion in 1959-60. Since then the club had enjoyed their longest ever spell in the top flight and were becoming established as a permanent fixture in the First Division although relegation in the Spring of 1965 may have doomed the club to obscurity.
Kerr had taken a gamble in bringing players with no experience in Scottish football, like Mogens Berg and Lennart Wing, to the club to help fight relegation. The gamble paid off, and Persson’s classy play on the wing and pinpoint crosses being complementary to Døssing's huge goal scoring talent. United managed mid-table security by the end of the season. In the following 1965-66 season Persson played a crucial role in helping United to finish in 5th place in the league qualifying for Europe for the first time. The 1966-67 was to be Persson's last at Tannadice, but arguably his most successful. Scoring 11 goals in 29 appearances from the wing as well as helping United to two victories over FC Barcelona and one over Juventus in the Fairs Cup although the success of the Scandinavians with United in their first season in Europe was a little overshadowed by Celtic's homegrown Lisbon Lions that year.
Persson was immensely popular at United playing in 101 matches and scoring 17 goals. He has the distinction (shared with fellow countryman Lennart Wing) of being the first Dundee United player to win a full international cap. He won a total of 9 Sweden caps while with United.
He moved to Rangers in May 1967 where he played 113 games, scored 31 goals (often spectacular ones) and won 6 caps, representing his country at the World Cup in 1970. Later that year he returned to Örgryte IS and went on to play for Sweden at the 1974 World Cup.

Rui'an, also known as Meitou, has a history which goes back to about 2000 BC, when it became known for its machine production. The historic city began its trade and commerce in ancient times and saw busy streets and flourishing businesses. In the 2nd century BC it was called the Kingdom of Dong'ou. Under the Tang Dynasty, it was promoted to prefecture status and given its current name in 675 AD.
Economy.
Rui'an has been a rich and prosperous city since ancient times. However, it was not until the practice of economic reform and opening that Rui'an regained its momentum. The people of Rui'an have been pioneers in many fields, especially in the development of China's market economy in the form of joint-stock system.
They set up the household contract responsibility system which would encourage the citizens to take lead in the household industries and they tried their best to sell their products. Consequently, Rui'an experienced fast economic development. The government induced the rural entrepreneurs and shareholders to co-operate effectively. Many kinds of economic systems have been introduced in Rui'an, making regional development speedier. One such system is the famous “Wenzhou Pattern“, which became well known both in China and abroad.
In 2005, Rui'an ranked 39th place in comprehensive economic strength among the first 100 counties and cities of china. In the 20 square kilometer economic development zone at the provincial level, there is enthusiasm for capital investment in building Rui'an into a new urban area with comprehensive development of industry, trade, science and technology. Rui'an is also known for its production of plastics and auto accessories.
Transportation.
The infrastructure of Rui'an has become better and better, with an ever-quickening pace of urbanization. Now, it has modernized traffic control systems, transportation and communication. The Wenzhou Yongqiang Airport, the 10,000-ton seaport and the railway station are each less than 30 kilometers from the city proper. The coastal super highway and the No.104 state highway which run across the city, and the Rui'an station on the Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway are a few examples of developments in transportation in Rui'an.
Resources.
As a coastal city, Rui'an is rich in natural resources. About 100 nautical away miles from the estuary of Feiyunjiang, there lie under the seabed rich crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are now being prospected and developed.
Ruianese Ex-pats.
Rui'an has been famous for its expatriates in China since the Song Dynasty. In spite of all difficulties and perils, Rui'an people have left their native land travelling to foreign countries to create businesses. At the present, more than 80,000 Rui'anese ex-pats occupy 60 countries, and nearly 120,000 ex-pats’ families. There is almost 1 Rui'anese among 5 ex-pats in France and Italy.

Thomas William Worsdell

Thomas William Worsdell (14 January 1838 – 28 June 1916) was an English locomotive engineer. He was born in Liverpool into a Quaker family.
Family.
T. W. Worsdell – normally known as William – was the eldest son of Nathaniel Worsdell (1809–1886), and grandson of the coachbuilder Thomas Clarke Worsdell (1788–1862). His younger brother, Wilson Worsdell (1850–1920), was also a locomotive engineer. T. C. Worsdell had become a Quaker at some point between 1812 and 1816, and his descendants, including Nathaniel, William and Wilson, were brought up in the Quaker faith.
William was born at his parents' house in Liverpool on 14 January 1838. He began school at the age of two, and in 1847 was sent as a boarder to Ackworth, a Quaker school in Yorkshire, where he remained until 1852.
Career.
He worked at the Crewe Works of the LNWR under John Ramsbottom but in 1865 moved to the United States to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1871 he was invited by Francis William Webb to return to Crewe. In 1881 he was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway, but in 1885 moved to the North Eastern Railway, being replaced at the GER by James Holden. He retired from the NER on 1 October 1890 due to ill health and was replaced by his younger brother Wilson Worsdell.
Patents.
Worsdell obtained a number of patents including several (in association with August von Borries, a Prussian locomotive engineer) relating to compound locomotives. T. W. Worsdell used the von Borries two-cylinder compound system in several of his designs for the North Eastern Railway.

Spiegelman Monster

Spiegelman Monster is the name given to an RNA chain of only 218 nucleotides that is able to be reproduced by an RNA replication enzyme. It is named after its creator, Sol Spiegelman, of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Description.
Spiegelman introduced RNA from a simple bacteriophage Qβ (Qβ) into a solution which contained Qβ's RNA replication enzyme, some free nucleotides, and some salts. In this environment, the RNA started to replicate. After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated.
Shorter RNA chains were able to replicate faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. Such a short RNA had been able to replicate very quickly in these unnatural circumstances.
In 1997, Eigen and Oehlenschlager showed that the Spiegelman monster eventually becomes even shorter, containing only 48 or 54 nucleotides, which are simply the binding sites for the reproducing enzyme RNA replicase.
M. Sumper and R. Luce of Eigen's laboratory demonstrated that a mixture containing no RNA at all but only RNA bases and Qβ replicase can, under the right conditions, spontaneously generate self-replicating RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster.

Norwegian Air Ambulance

The Norwegian Air Ambulance is the air ambulance service in Norway organised through the government owned limited company Luftambulansetjenesten ("Air Ambulance Service"). The service provides helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) and fixed-wing air ambulance operations. 
Dedicated planes are provided at six airports, and helicopters at 11 hospitals. In addition the service depends on the state Search and rescue helicopters for a full national coverage. The fixed-wing aircraft and HEMS helicopters are operated by the private companies Lufttransport and Norsk Luftambulanse on contract for the Air Ambulance Service. The rescue helicopters are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force 330 squadron
History.
Air ambulance services in Norway have been operated by private companies and the military since the 1920s, but the first dedicated service came in 1972 when the Air Force 330 squadron was equipped with Westland Sea King helicopters. The helicopters were purchased by the ministry of justice while they were to be operated by the Air Force.
In 1973 the Norwegian government started looking at possible ways to organise an air ambulance service in Norway. Before the government had made a decision, the foundation Norsk Luftambulanse had been founded in 1977 and provided one helicopter from its base at Lørenskog. In 1983 the government started buying services from the foundation, and in 1988 a nationwide air ambulance service was started where the government bought services from private companies.
By 1993 three companies had established themselves on the domestic air ambulance marked in Norway: Norsk Luftambulanse, Airlift and Lufttransport. In 2002 Norsk Luftambulanse bought the air ambulance operation from Airlift, and merged the operations. In April 2006 the Air Ambulance Service has extended its contracts with Norsk Luftambulanse and Lufttransport until 2014.
Operations.
Helicopter emergency medical service.
The helicopter ambulances are located on heliports at 11 hospitals around the country. The helicopters are operated by the private companies Lufttransport and Norsk Luftambulanse. Lufttransport operates a total of four AgustaWestland AW139 while Norsk Luftambulanse operates a total of 13 Eurocopter EC 135 P2 and Eurocopter EC 145 for the service.
Helicopters are stationed at the hospitals in Arendal, Bergen, Brønnøysund, Dombås, Førde, Lørenskog, Stavanger, Tromsø, Trondheim, Ål and Ålesund. The helicopters must be airborne within 15 minutes.
Fixed-wing ambulances.
Plane ambulances are stationed at six airports in Norway. The service is provided by Lufttransport with 12 Beech King Air B200 aircraft. The airplanes are stationed at Alta Airport, Bodø Airport, Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, Tromsø Airport and Ålesund Airport, Vigra.
Search and rescue helicopters.
The Air Force 330 squadron has its headquarters at Sola Air Station outside Stavanger. The squadron operates out of four military airports: Sola Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Bodø Main Air Station, Banak Air Station and Rygge Air Station. A detachment is located at the civilian airport in Florø.
The squadron operates 12 Sea King helicopters and had 1 038 operations in 2005. At any given time the 330 squadron has six helicopters on 15 minutes readiness, one at each station. The helicopters are under command of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway located at Sola which is responsible for Southern Norway (Rygge, Sola, Florø and Ørland) and the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway located at Bodø which is responsible for Northern Norway (Bodø and Banak). The primary function is search and rescue (SAR) but several hundred air ambulance missions are undertaken each year.

Caseros Prison Demolition Project – 16 Tons

The Caseros Prison Demolition Project — 80,000 Tons, which contains "16 Tons" and "Aparecidos" is the work of artist Seth Wulsin. It uses the defunct Caseros Prison of Buenos Aires, Argentina and its demolition as raw materials.
"Aparecido" is the past participle for the Spanish verb "aparecer" - to appear. Its second meaning is apparition or ghost. It may also refer in an oblique way to Argentina's Dirty War, in which an estimated 30,000 people, "Desaparecidos" were disappeared between 1976 and 1981 by the military junta, many of them thrown from airplanes into the Rio Plate.
"Sixteen Tons", the name of a popular song written in the late 1940s, referred to the amount of coal a miner was expected to load in a day, but in this context may refer to the amount of glass broken out through the installation, or de-installation, process.
80,000 tons is the approximate weight of the entire building, and the debris that the demolition produced.
The demolition.
On a basic level, the demolition of the prison, contracted out by the city government of Buenos Aires to the Argentine military, was the seed for the artwork. The building was slated for demolition in 2001, but the process was subject to various legal, environmental and bureaucratic roadblocks. The original plan was to implode the building in three steps. But the implosion was stopped at the last minute by a group of neighbors concerned about the possibility of damaging environmental effects, including asbestos poisoning and the possibility of driving millions of rats out of the tunnels underneath the prison. Caseros was demolished by mechanical means floor by floor from the top down between 2003 and 2008. The cost of demolishing the prison, and thus the budget for the artwork, was estimated at somewhere between one and three million dollars.
The grids.
The window grids on the north end of the former prison provided the locus and point of entry for the work. Each grid was approximately tall and wide. Breaking out certain windows, Wulsin created faces in each of the 48 outer grids on the building. Each grid consisted of 11 x 19 (209) circular semi-opaque windows, eight inches (203 mm) in diameter. The windows that remained reflected the light of the sky, the sun and the moon, producing images from certain angles that were completely a function of space and light—the dark interior space of the prison, and the light shining through the optically reflective space of the remaining windows.
The pictorial space of each image was directed at different points on the ground where the sun reflecting in the windows was visible. The viewing angles changed throughout the year as the sun's elevation in the sky changed.
In addition to the 48 outer window grids, there were also 48 grids facing inward, directly opposite the outer grids. They didn't reflect the light of the sun from any possible viewing angles on the street, but the artist worked with them as well, using morse code to embed messages in the window grids.
The window grids were already in various stages of decomposition when Wulsin found the building, with almost a third of the total number of windows already broken out by inmates during various prison riots when the jail was still in use.
The cycle of appearance and disappearance that took place according to the daily, monthly and yearly lunar and solar cycles, and the position of the potential viewer was underscored at a larger magnitude by the demolition process, which consisted in the removal of the building from the top down, floor by floor. The demolition lasted until March 2008, with the majority of the rubble taken to a fill in the River Plate at Costanera Norte near Jorge Newbury Airport.
After discovering the prison in January 2006, while exploring the neighborhood of Parque Patricios, where he'd recently moved from New York, Wulsin spent four months navigating the bureaucracies of the national and city governments of Argentina and Buenos Aires, respectively, to gain authorization to enter the building and carry out the onsite work. The resolution authorizing the project was finally signed on Friday, June 16 (Bloomsday), 2006 by Minister of Public Works of the city of Buenos Aires, Juan Schiavi. The security tarp made by Wulsin to direct broken glass back inside the building was blue and white, and painted with the hot air balloon logo of the local Parque Patricios soccer team Huracan. The five weeks of onsite work were completed on Marcel Duchamp's birthday, July 28. But the project itself was ongoing through the entire demolition process of the building.

<doc id="5977457" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977457" title="Musical clock">
Musical clock

A musical clock is a clock that marks the hours of the day with a musical tune played from a spiked cylinder either on bells, organ pipes, bellows, combs and even dulcimer strings.
The earliest ones began in mainly churches and would be used to mark times for the public and for farmers in fields to tell them when it was sunset dawn and lunchtime.
Some musical clocks play a tune each hour whereas others are known to play every 3 to 4 hours. This might have originated with the Angelus and/or Liturgy of the Hours.
The earliest known domestic one is by Nicholas Vallin, made in 1598, and it currently resides in the British Museum in London. This clock plays a different piece of music on every 1/4 hour. However some purists argue this clock is still technically a quarter chiming clock due to the quarter past melody only being around 8 notes long. The hour melody is certainly a tune though.
In terms of domestic clocks—most particular early ones—all the European clocks played tunes on carillons of bells from a large spiked drum within the clock. Many of these were in bracket clock form and there are a majority of longcase ones too. Some played their tunes each hour while others played every 3 or 4 hours usually either preceded or followed by the hour strikes.
Builders in the Black Forest later started to make trumpeteer musical clocks which played on horn bellows and have animated figures appear (usually of some kind of trumpeter), and appear to be blowing out the tune. Some of the London clock makers also started using organ mechanisms and coned cylinder-type music boxes; some were even combined with a set of bells to play tunes using both instruments implemented, although these are much rarer.
Musical clocks are even more interesting because they can play music using as few as 6 bells but usually with multiple hammers for quick note succession, but on average most would have 8, 10, 12 or 13 bells and multiple hammers, particularly if it has a lot more complex tunes. There are always exceptions and there are musical clocks out there with 16 to even 20 bells and usually have around 14–15 different tunes. On average most have 2–7 tunes selectable via a subsidiary dial.
In fact, some musical clocks were made with interchangeable spike drums allowing the owner to peg them to play whatever tune they desired, although these were very rare.
Most all had their own specially made music spiked drums.
No matter what kind of musical clock it is: a turret/church clock, a bracket clock, a carriage clock, a longcase clock, an organ clock, or whatever else, the same basic system of how the clock plays its tunes is the same. It all revolves around a large cylinder which is spiked and pushed the relevant hammers or combs.
Beginning in the 1988, Rhythm Small World Clocks introduced modern battery powered musical clocks. Storing their music on computer chips, the first models played 6 melodies in rotation. Newer clocks play up to 18 melodies including Christmas tunes. Rhythm Small World Clocks was the only major brand in the market until 2000 when Seiko introduced their Melodies in Motion Clocks. Both Seiko and Rhythm musical clocks perform a new melody every hour on the hour and feature a light sensor which automatically switches off the music in the dark. Modern musical clocks play popular, country, classical or holiday melodies. The most popular modern musical clocks have elaborate motions where the clock face opens up revealing crystals, flashing lights, or other eye catching details.

He made his international debut for Jamaica in 2004, and has earned 73 caps, scoring 35 goals. He has played at three CONCACAF Gold Cups.
Club career.
Harbour View.
Shelton started his career in the club youth system before becoming a first regular by the age of 18. While at Harbour View he won the CFU Club Championship and the National Premier League. He was also recognised as youth player of the year during his tenure.
Helsingborg.
In August 2005 Shelton was due to move to Football League Championship club Burnley after a successful pre-season trial. They attempted to sign Shelton, but a work permit was rejected, and in August 2006 he joined Helsingborg for about £100,000. During the 2006 season, he scored nine goals in 19 games in the Swedish Allsvenskan, despite playing only irregularly due to repeated injuries. He scored a total of 17 goals in 28 competitive matches, including five goals in four Swedish Cup matches on the way to Helsingborg's victory in the competition. His 120th minute equaliser against to-be league champions Elfsborg in the quarter-final, which Helsingborg won 5–3 after a penalty shootout (4–4 after extra time), and the 1–0 goal in the final against Gefle, were two of his highlights at the club.
Sheffield United.
Despite being signed amidst much fanfare, Shelton did not make his full début until April 2007 in a 2–0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. He made only three more appearances for the Blades in the Premiership that season as they unsuccessfully battled to avoid relegation.
With the arrival of James Beattie and Billy Sharp at Bramall Lane during the close season he found games no more easy to come by under new manager Bryan Robson. Initially limited to cup appearances, he scored his first competitive goals for the club, netting twice in a 5–0 League Cup win over Morecambe in September 2007.
As the team struggled he began to see more first team action, but was unable to turn appearances into goals, scoring only twice more that season, against Manchester City in the FA Cup and Colchester in the league. With the arrival of new manager Kevin Blackwell Shelton was sidelined once more.

Underwater panther

An Underwater panther, called Mishipeshu or Mishibijiw in Ojibwe, is one of the most important of several water beings among many Great Lakes and Northeastern Woodlands Native American tribes, particularly among the Anishinaabe peoples.
Mishipeshu translates into "The Great Lynx." It has the head and paws of a giant cat but is covered in scales and has dagger-like spikes running along its back and tail. Mishipeshu calls Michipicoten Island in Lake Superior his home and is a powerful creature in the mythological traditions of some Native American tribes, particularly Anishinaabe tribes, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi, of the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. In addition to the Anishinaabeg, Innu also have Mishibizhiw stories.
To the Algonquins, the underwater panther was the most powerful underworld being. The Ojibwe traditionally held them to be masters of all water creatures, including snakes. Some versions of the Nanabozho creation legend refer to whole communities of water lynx.
Some archaeologists believe that underwater panthers were major components of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex of the Mississippian culture in the prehistoric American Southeast.
Name.
In the Ojibwe language, this creature is sometimes called "Mishibizhiw, Mishipizhiw, Mishipizheu, Mishupishu, Mishepishu, Michipeshu", or "Mishibijiw", which translates as "Great Lynx", or "Gichi-anami'e-bizhiw" ("Gitche-anahmi-bezheu"), which translates as "the fabulous night panther." However, it is also commonly referred to as the "Great underground wildcat" or "Great under-water wildcat." It is the most important of the underwater animals for the Ojibwa.
Description.
In Native American mythologies of the Great Lakes, underwater panthers are described as water monsters that live in opposition to the Thunderbirds, masters of the powers of the air. Underwater Panthers are seen as an opposing yet complementary force to the Thunderbirds, and they are engaged in eternal conflict.
Underwater panther was an amalgam of features from many animals: the body of a wild feline, often a mountain lion or lynx; the horns of deer or bison; upright scales on its back; occasionally bird feathers; and parts from other animals as well, depending on the particular myth. Underwater panthers are represented with exceptionally long tails, occasionally with serpentine properties. The creatures are thought to roar or hiss in the sounds of storms or rushing rapids.
"Mishipizheu" were said to live in the deepest parts of lakes and rivers, where they can cause storms. Some traditions believed the underwater panthers to be helpful, protective creatures, but more often they were viewed as malevolent beasts that brought death and misfortune. They often need to be placated for safe passage across a lake. As late as the 1950s, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians performed a traditional ceremony to placate the Underworld Panther and maintain balance with the Thunderbird.
When ethnographer Johann Kohl visited the United States in the 1850s, he spoke with a Fond du Lac chief, who showed Kohl a piece of copper kept in his medicine bag. The chief said it was a strand of hair from the "mishibizhiw", and thus considered extremely powerful.
Copper.
The history of Mishipeshu is merely a legend for some, but for Algonquin Indians and their relatives it is as real as the water and precious metal it guarded. Mishipeshu is known for guarding the vast amounts of copper in Lake Superior and the Great Lakes Region. There seems to be substantial evidence that there was a very ancient and unknown people that mined the copper and moved the majority to an undisclosed location. Later, during the 17th century, the Jesuit Missionaries arrived in the Great Lakes Region. By that time, swiping copper from the region was extremely taboo and forbidden by the Ojibwa tribe. It was even worse to take it from the Great Lynx's home, Michipicoten Island - this was considered to be stealing from Mishipeshu himself.
Close encounters.
There are a few stories that might be of true believers of this great beast. A Jesuit missionary named Claude Dablon told a story about four Ojibwa Indians who embarked on a journey to the home of Mishipeshu to take some copper back to their home, and use it to heat water. The very second they pushed off and backed into the water with their canoe, the eerie voice of the water panther surrounded them. The water panther came growling after them, vigorously accusing them of stealing the playthings of his children. All four of the Indians died on the way back to their village; the last one surviving just long enough to tell the tale of what had happened in his final moments before he finally died. During the 1840s there was a copper rush; people there had realized the value of copper which was for the taking around Isle Royale and Keweenaw Peninsula. There was great suffering and accidents to which many key people and vessels fell victim. The steamer Cumberland was lost at the Rock of Ages Reef on Isle Royale. Another ship, by the name of Algoma, was sunk in a storm during 1885, and forty-five people sunk to a watery death in the creature's lair.
Depictions in art.
The underwater panther is well represented in pictographs. Historical Anishnaabe twined and quilled men's bags often feature an underwater panther on one panel and the Thunderbird on the other. Norval Morrisseau (Ojibwe) painted underwater panthers in his Woodlands style artworks, contemporary paintings based on Ojibwe oral history and cosmology. The emblem has been embellished, and appears as a decorative motif on muskets.
The Canadian Museum of Civilization includes an underwater panther in its coat of arms.
"Alligator" mound.
In 2003 archaeologist Brad Lepper suggested that the Alligator Effigy Mound in Granville, Ohio represents the underwater panther. Lepper suggests that early European settlers, when learning from Native Americans that the mound represented a fierce creature that lived in the water and ate people, mistakenly assumed that the Native Americans were referring to an alligator.

Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad

The Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad (G&P), now defunct, was an American railroad located in southwestern Montana and east-central Idaho. Constructed in 1909 and 1910 between the towns of Armstead, Montana and Salmon, Idaho, the G&P served mining and agricultural areas in Lemhi County, Idaho and Beaverhead County, Montana. The line was financially backed by the Northern Pacific Railway, and later became its subsidiary. Never financially successful, the G&P ceased operations in 1939, and the railroad was dismantled the following year.
Planning and construction.
During the first decade of the 20th Century Lemhi County, in the remote Salmon River country of central Idaho, was seeing both increased agricultural development and substantial, renewed mining activity. The area was part of one of the largest contiguous blocks of land not served by a railroad at that time, and consequently there was significant interest in the prospect of building a railway line to (or through) the region. The desire for a railroad was perhaps most strongly felt by those promoting the county's mining developments, although a variety of existing railway companies also studied the prospects of the area. The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) gave Lemhi County particular attention, envisioning a new transcontinental route that would veer southward from existing NP lines in Montana, cross into Idaho via Bannock Pass, and then follow the rugged Salmon River canyon westward across the state.
These dreams began translating to action in 1907 when a group of Pennsylvania businessmen led by W, A, McCutcheon incorporated the Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railroad. McCutcheon envisioned a railroad running westward from a connection with the Oregon Short Line Railroad at Armstead, Montana. The line would enter Lemhi County via Bannock Pass, and continue to the Lemhi River valley. In the valley, branch lines would run upstream to the promising mining camp of Gilmore, and downstream to the county seat of Salmon. Soon, McCutcheon was able to interest NP officials in his plan, since a completed G&P could form a basis for a future NP line down the Salmon River. The NP assisted in the initial survey of the G&P route, and later agreed to financially and materially support the G&P's construction.
A contract for construction of the G&P grade was awarded in March, 1909, and work began in earnest the following month. Construction was pursued in earnest throughout the following year, working west from Armstead, and the tracklayers reached Salmon on April 25, 1910. The completed line was in length, and was largely built to the mainline standards of the NP. A golden spike celebration was held in Salmon that May 18, even though portions of the line—including the tunnel under Bannock Pass—were still being completed. Regular passenger and freight service on the G&P began soon thereafter.
Optimism and rumors concerning further expansion of the G&P persisted through 1910. McCutcheon had promised that the line would be extended northward from Armstead to Dillon, Montana that year, the first step in completing a connection to the NP's trackage at nearby Twin Bridges. No further construction took place, however, in part due to G&P legal difficulties in securing right-of-way between Armstead and Dillon. Simultaneously, though, the NP began to realize the engineering difficulties and limited economic potential of its proposed Salmon River route, and local G&P officials began to discover that the local traffic potential was actually far less than anticipated. Consequently, the hopes for future expansion of the G&P soon faded, and the line was never extended beyond either Armstead or Salmon.
Route.
The route of the G&P was remote, thinly populated, and often rugged. The line began at the small hamlet of Armstead, Montana, a station stop on the Oregon Short Line Railroad's route between Idaho Falls, Idaho and Butte, Montana. (The Oregon Short Line was a long-time subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, and was later absorbed into that system.) Armstead was in a high valley of the Beaverhead River, in a region known for livestock grazing. The G&P maintained a small yard there, and it was the site of the railroad's corporate office.
From Armsted, the railway headed almost due west, traversing a thinly-populated ranching region known as Horse Prairie. The area provided additional livestock traffic for the railroad, and there were mines in the nearby mountains. Substantial areas of cut and fill were required as the railroad ascended the prairie. The railroad curved southward near the western end of Horse Prairie. and began its ascent of Bannock Pass.
Bannock Pass, on the Idaho-Montana border and the Continental Divide, was by far the most substantial obstacle encountered by the G&P. The pass itself is at an elevation of , some higher than the center of Horse Prairie. Temporary trackage was built over the top of the pass during the G&P's construction, but a tunnel beneath the pass was clearly needed for the railway's permanent use. Since a tunnel to completely bypass the heavy grades of the pass was prohibitively expensive, the railroad compromised by boring a shorter, tunnel at the elevation. To bring the tracks to the elevation of the tunnel, the railroad line included a switchback on each side of the summit; trains ascending the pass would pull into the first switchback, run backwards through the summit tunnel, and then reverse direction again at the switchback on the opposite side. 
Descending Bannock Pass, the railroad followed a narrow canyon into Idaho's Lemhi Valley and the small agricultural community of Leadore, some from Armstead. The G&P's repair shops were at Leadore, and it also marked a junction point for the railway. The main line continued northwest from Leadore for another , following the broad valley and the Lemhi River downstream through fertile farming and ranching land to the county seat of Salmon. Salmon was the line's terminus, and by far the largest town on the G&P route, with a 1910 population of 1,434.
The only branch line operated by the G&P began at Leadore and headed southeast, following the Lemhi River valley upstream about to the town of Gilmore, near the upper end of the valley. Gilmore in 1910 was the center of a prosperous silver and lead mining district, and was thus a major source of early traffic for the railroad.
Operating history.
When the G&P began service in 1910 the railroad owned a total of 8 steam locomotives, 16 passenger cars, 250 freight cars, a rotary snowplow, and other miscellaneous pieces of equipment; except for some of the freight cars, all equipment was acquired second-hand. When service began that May, the G&P scheduled a tri-weekly passenger train between Armstead and Salmon, leaving Armstead on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and returning on the following days. Freight trains also operated on most days. Traffic levels proved lower than expected, however, and in 1913 the separate freight and passenger services were replaced by a tri-weekly mixed train, carrying both freight and passenger equipment.
Both passenger and freight traffic declined in later years, and beginning in 1922 mixed train service was partially supplanted by a Brill railbus, a self-propelled vehicle designed to carry passengers and small freight shipments. For most of the 1920s, the railbus operated between Salmon and Gilmore, while the tri-weekly mixed continued between Salmon and Armstead. In 1931, the G&P borrowed a second, larger railbus from the Northern Pacific, and used it to provide a daily-except-Sunday roundtrip between Armstead and Salmon. The mixed was discontinued at that time, and freight trains began operating only as required, usually about once a week.
Service on the Gilmore branch was more dependent on the output of the district's mines, and as they declined and ultimately closed rail service to Gilmore dropped correspondingly. The Gilmore branch was largely out of service by the 1930s.
The railroad's equipment roster was significantly reduced over the years, as well, because of a lack of traffic and a need to conserve expenses. The majority of the line's passenger and freight cars, and all but two of the locomotives, were gone by the early 1930s.
Operations of the railroad were directed by its President and General Manager, W. N. Bichler (1881–1955). Bichler, who lived in Armstead, managed the railroad throughout its entire corporate history, from construction to abandonment.
Decline and abandonment.
Traffic levels on the G&P never began to reach the optimistic expectations of the line's backers, and by the early 1910s it was clear that they never would. The railroad's lack of economic viability was realized as early as 1913, when the G&P's substantial construction indebtedness (nearly $6,000,000) was written off by the Northern Pacific in exchange for full ownership of the line. Despite continual efforts to economize, the railroad lost money throughout much of its existence.
The railroad's prospects worsened in the 1920s, as the Gilmore mines declined and eventually closed, and in the 1930s as improved local roadways made auto traffic to and within the region easier. By the late 1930s it was clear that the G&P's days were numbered. Early in 1939 the railroad announced that it was out of money and would cease operating effective that May 1. The moribund railroad sat unused until the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the line's abandonment in 1940, and the track was removed later that year.
Remnants.
While much of the physical evidence of the G&P has disappeared since the railroad's abandonment, numerous traces of the route still remain visible in the 21st Century. The line's eastern terminus at Armstead is now beneath the waters of Clark Canyon Reservoir. Elsewhere, though, most of the railroad's grade in Montana remains readily visible, as does the former alignment over Bannock Pass. Less of the old G&P grade between Leadore and Salmon is evident today, due to agricultural and highway development, as the highway is on the G&P right of way for most of the way from Leadore to Salmon. The Bannock Pass tunnel remains visible, although the bore has partially collapsed. Gilmore has long been a ghost town.
The only major G&P building to survive in 2006 is the former freight house at Leadore, A modern structure nearby (serving as the town's community center) is a replica of the former Leadore depot building. Several derelict railway cars once used on the G&P still exist on farms and ranches along the railroad's former route.

Beto Vázquez Infinity

Beto Vázquez Infinity is an Argentine metal band from Buenos Aires, formed in 2000.
Biography.
After the split-up of Nepal, the Argentinean bass player and songwriter Beto Vazquez continued enlarging his musical horizons, always accumulating new ideas, and with the hope of finally making a group of musicians that could fulfill and understand what he really wanted to transmit. This new creative stage in Beto's career uses very varied compositions in what refers to styles. In September 1999, he finished to compose what would be a demo, which was listened by the record label Nems Enterprises, who immediately offered him a record deal. Vazquez would have the hard task now of finding musicians that were adjusted to the high standards that the project demanded. The company also suggested him that the album could be sang in English by voices of international fame, making it easy for the album to be released worldwide. Without a doubt, a great challenge for an Argentinean musician; difficult but not impossible. All the songs were created by Beto Vazquez and performed by the band. This way, in charge of the songwriting, the musical direction, the arrangements; and playing four & five strings bass, acoustic and electric, acoustic and electric guitar, Vazquez was able to expand his potential as a musician and give shape to a new project based on his personal music favorites (Pink Floyd, Rhapsody, Helloween, Skyclad, Porcupine Tree, Moonspell, Blackmore's Night, In Flames, etc.). On the first album the guests were: Tarja Turunen (ex Nightwish), Candice Night (Blackmore's Night), Sabine Edelsbacher (Edenbridge) and Fabio Lione (Rhapsody).
In April 2002 the tour producer José Luis Botto poposed Beto to take the band on tour and play in Spain, in a fest where bands such as Barón Rojo, Shaman, Ángeles del Infierno and Dark Moor among others would take part. Therefore, the band travelled to Spain and gave their first international show there. Beto Vazquez Infinity played as support with bands like: Nightwish, Labyrinth, Vision Divine, Angra, Tierra Santa and others.
In 2003 and 2004 composed other full CD of the band, called "Space Without Limits", on which participated artists like: Liv Kristine (Leaves Eyes), Floor Jansen (After Forever), Elisa Martin (Dreamaker), Arjen Lucassen (Ayreon), Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto (Charon), Walter Giardino (Rata Blanca) among others. Unfortunately, the album is still delayed by the record |Nems Enterprises by mix troubles and they are working to edit it. Nems Enterprises is the only who can release "Space Without Limits".
The second studio album called Flying Towards The New Horizon was released in 2006 under of Beto Vazquez own label, BVM Records.
International artists participate again such as Antti Raili (Celesty), Aldo Lonobile (Secret Sphere) and Sonia Pineault (Forgotten Tales) among others. The album was released in Argentina, China and Taiwan and was the first step of Beto Vazquez as producer of hes own projects.
Continuing the musical composition, 2008 come and so did Darkmind with guests musicians such as Olaf Thorsen (Vision Divine - Labyrinth), Sandra Schleret (Elis), Marcela Bovio (Stream of Passion) and Manda Ophuis (Nemesea) among others. All prestigious musicians who agreed to collaborate on the project, for this special Argentina edition. Continuing with the eclectic style of the compositions,within Darkimnd we can found, from a saxophone duet with the bass to gothic, power or rockers songs. This third full studio album, received excellent reviews from all over the world and gave a new impetus and creativity Beto Vazquez Infinity.
Two months after Darkmind release, Beto Vazquez was already writing what would be a challenge in his career. The idea of constant improvement and the desire to keep doing different things ended in a new studio album, this time a double one, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the band in two different releases.
A limited numbered digipack edition, only a thousand copies exclusively for Argentina and another in double jewel case for the rest of the world.
Twenty guest musicians, eleven countries were involved in the project. Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius ex), Dominique Leurquin (Rhapsody of Fire), Alfred Romero (Dark Moor) Jacob Jansen (Anubis Gate) among other major artists that Beto chooses not only for their musical talent but also for what they are as people, getting a friendly and funy working team to create what will be released as¨Existence¨ on 2010 
A new era began with more musical challenges, Beto worked to finish the rock opera which would name the new album. Titled ¨BEYOND SPACE WITHOUT LIMITS¨
This new albums is full of variety that runs along from power metal lines, symphonic gothic, all together with national and international musicians as always . The peculiarity of this album is that the complexity of the songs, worked with many classical instruments as horns, cellos, violins, flutes, percussion, and various vocals colors that add harmony to spice up one of the more complex Beto Vazquez 's compositions lasting more than 12 minutes with an unexpected ending, for this ambitious album.

Hebdomadal Council

The Hebdomadal Council was the chief executive body for the University of Oxford from its establishment in 1854 until its replacement, in the Michaelmas term of 2000, by the new University Council. The Hebdomadal Council held statutory responsibility for the management of the University's finances and property, University administration, and relations between the University and all outside institutions. Direct responsibility for academic administration was delegated to the General Board of the Faculties, with the Hebdomadal Council holding an oversight role. 
Eighteen members of the council were elected by Congregation of the full faculty. The Council had the prerogative of initiating resolutions and statutes, which were submitted to Congregation for approval. It met once every two weeks during University terms, and twice during the Long Vacation. 
One of their curious rituals was to only meet strictly once a week. This was highly peculiar because even if more meetings needed to be held to attend to financial or administrative matters, they would all be tied into one weekly meeting. Such is derivation of the name of their organization, the 'Hebdomadal' Council.

Dan Daniel (sportswriter)

Dan Daniel (June 6, 1890 – July 1, 1981), born Daniel Margowitz, was an American sportswriter whose prolific contributions over a long period led him to be called the Dean of American Baseball Writers.
Daniel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. His family moved to New York City when he was a boy, and he remained there throughout his career. He attended the City College of New York, where he managed the basketball team.
Daniel received his first writing assignment with the "New York Herald" in 1909 at the age of 19. He decided to use a single-name byline, “By Daniel”, because editors in the early 20th century were concerned that anti-Semitism would hurt newspaper sales if he used his Jewish surname.
1920s.
By 1924, he had settled at the "New York Telegram", where he remained for the next forty years. In 1925, he won Best Story of the Year from the Baseball Writers Association of America for his portrayal of Walter Johnson's loss in the seventh game of the Washington Senators/Pittsburgh Pirates World Series match-up.
In the early 1920s, Daniel helped start "Ring Magazine" with Nat Fleischer. He was a prolific contributor and editor throughout "The Ring"'s history and could be seen behind his desk at "The Ring" when he was well past the age of 80.
In addition to his daily columns for the "New York Telegram" (later "World Telegram" then "World Telegram and Sun"), Daniel wrote weekly columns for "The Sporting News", contributing more words to that publication than any other writer in its history.
1930s.
From 1930 through the 1960s, Daniel was a frequent contributor to "Baseball Magazine" and SPORT Magazine, along with other sporting publications of the day. His patriotic articles during World War II earned him wide praise. He was one of the first writers to identify the potential of both Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, extolling their virtues before either had swung a major league bat.
In 1930, Daniel was elected president of the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. That year, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker made Daniel sports chairman of his Committee for Relief of the Unemployed. The committee organized the first college basketball games in Madison Square Garden and raised the equivalent of 5 million dollars between 1930 and 1933. Walker presented a citation to Daniel at a testimonial dinner held in his honor, the first time a private citizen had been so-honored by the city.
Also in 1930, Daniel helped convince Babe Ruth to sign his record US$80,000 contract with the New York Yankees. Ruth had been holding out for more money and had threatened to boycott spring training in Saint Petersburg, Florida. Daniel helped Ruth come to the decision to sign by reminding him that many of his fans were out of work and selling apples on street corners back home in New York City.
Later in 1930, Daniel published "Babe Ruth, Idol of the American Boy". This early biography of The Babe was developed from material Daniel had published in a series of feature stories in the "New York Telegram". It included a forward to boys from The Babe admonishing them to “do everything in moderation”!
1940s.
Starting in the 1940s, his "Ask Daniel" column ran in the "World Telegram" every Tuesday. Daniel answered thousands of baseball questions, becoming one of the game's leading experts and historians. Each spring, Daniel put his reputation on the line by predicting how the eight teams in each league would finish. Cartoonist Willard Mullin captured the audacity of these predictions in charming caricatures.
Daniel was an accomplished speaker and raconteur. He had a rasping voice and a biting wit, which made him a popular choice as master of ceremonies for sports dinners and roasts.
Daniel was official scorer for more than twenty games during Joe DiMaggio's 1941 hitting streak. His decisions are still criticized more than 60 years later, but Daniel maintained throughout his life that he called each play as he saw it.
Shortly after Babe Ruth's death in 1948, Daniel wrote "The Real Babe Ruth", his second biography of the Babe, which contained many of his personal recollections from having been friend and advisor to Babe Ruth.
1970s.
In 1972, Daniel received baseball's highest honor for a writer, the J. G. Taylor Spink Award at the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his acceptance speech, he thanked the players and the fans for “giving him the medium of a wonderful career”. He mused that without baseball, he would have ended up as a doctor and assured the audience that “Had I been a doctor, I would have made house-calls”.
At the age of 86, Daniel was still a relevant contributor to the history of New York City sports. In 1976, he co-authored “Yankee Stadium Then and Now”, a feature article in "The New York Times".
Daniel was a noted bibliophile and amassed a significant collection of first editions, befriending book sellers in the cities he frequented as he traveled with the Yankees and other teams. His collection included an imprint of Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric, published by Gunther Zainer in 1476.
Death.
Dan Daniel died in Pompano Beach, Florida, at the age of 91.

Introvoys

INTRoVOYS is a Filipino pop rock band formed in 1986 by 3rd-G Cristobal, Paco Arespacochaga and Jonathan Buencamino. The band is now based in Los Angeles, California.
History.
Formation and early years: 1986-1988.
INTRoVOYS was born in Manila, Philippines and formed in 1986 by 3rd-G Cristobal, Paco Arespacochaga and Jonathan Buencamino. 3rd-G and Paco were classmates in high school, but have known each other since elementary. 3rd was part of the Rondalla group. When 3rd G told Paco that he was looking to start a band, Paco told him that he had the same idea in mind. It was then that Paco introduced Jonathan Buencamino to 3rd-G. The first incarnation of INTRoVOYS had Jonathan Buencamino, Paco Arespacochaga and 3rd-G Cristobal in a small rehearsal space on the corner of Katipunan and Santolan in Quezon City, Philippines, During their first rehearsal, 3rd-G taught Paco how to play the drums. Later, they added Jonathan Buencamino's younger brother Jj in keyboards, Ira Cruz in lead guitars, and Jobert Buencamino in bass guitar and they recorded the song "Just a Dream" and released on the "10 of Another Kind" compilation album in 1988.
"Back to the Roots" and line-up changes: 1989-1991.
Due to other priorities, 3rd-G had to give up his position as the band’s rhythm guitar player. The band's released their debut album "Back to the Roots" in 1990. Their first two singles received a lukewarm response and the band's label, Dyna Records, was ready to drop them. In spite of this, their third single "However Which Way", went to No. 1 in Metro Manila in just two weeks. It became the No. 1 song in the country after a month, paving the way for a national tour. Culled from the same album are certified No. 1 singles such as, "Calling All Nations", "Maynila" and "Lullabye" among many others.. Ira Cruz left the band in 1991.
"Breaking New Grounds" and "Line To Heaven": 1991-1994.
When Cruz left INTRoVOYS, Vic Carpio replaced him as their new guitarist. The band's second album, "Breaking New Grounds", was released in 1992. Included in this album were the hits "Will I Survive", "Di Na Ako Aasa Pa", "Binibini" and "Are You Happy". The album achieved quadruple platinum status, earning INTRoVOYS the tag "The No. 1 Band in the Land".. In 1993, the band released their third album, "Line to Heaven". The carrier single was written after Arespacochaga suffered the tragic loss of his parents in a car accident. and their hit "Kailanman".

They released their fifth album "Eroplano" with their rendition of Rey Valera's hit "Kung Kailangan Mo Ako". A year later, Jonathan Buencamino was forced to leave due to an illness that caused him to lose his voice indefinitely.
Short-Lived Reunion and Hiatus: 2000-2004.
In 2000, Paco Arespacochaga going solo and released his solo album called "Rebirth" featuring three popular songs of his former band and a collaboration with his former wife Geneva Cruz.Paco Arespacochaga rejoined the band in 2000. Ira Cruz, who had played with INTRoVOYS from 1988 to 1991, rejoined with the original line-up members Paco, Jonathan, Jj & Jobert Buencamino and Vic Carpio for the short-lived reunion run in 2001 and after that, He decided to pursue other interests. He joined Passage and Co-founded the Band Kapatid. Vic Carpio and Jobert Buencamino decided to retire and pursue other interest and the other members decided to go on an indefinite hiatus.

Stalingrad-class battlecruiser

The "Stalingrad"-class battlecruiser, also known in the Soviet Union as Project 82 (), was intended to be built for the Soviet Navy after World War II. Three ships were ordered, but none were ever completed.
A heavy cruiser was designed before the Second World War as an intermediate between the light cruiser and classes and the s. The specification, or OTZ in Russian, was issued in May 1941, but plans were shelved with the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany. Construction was proposed again in 1943. After a lengthy design period, which Premier Joseph Stalin—a major supporter of the project—often had a hand in, keels for two ships were laid at the Marti South Shipyard in Nikolayev (1951) and the Baltic Works in Leningrad (1952) and a third ship was planned for the shipyard in Severodvinsk.
The Project 82 design which was ordered would have been much larger than the original intermediate design, so much so that they were considered the successors to the "Kronshtadt"s, which had been canceled at the outbreak of World War II. As envisioned by Stalin, the "Stalingrad" battlecruisers' role would be to disrupt and break up an enemy's light cruisers when they approached the Soviet coast. However, after his death in March 1953, the ships were canceled by the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machinery. Only the incomplete hull of "Stalingrad" was launched; used as a floating target for anti-ship missiles, it was scrapped around 1962.
Background and genesis.
The roots of the Project 82-class began back in May 1941 when the Main Naval Staff approved tactical requirements () for a medium-sized cruiser between the light cruisers of the and classes and the "heavy cruisers" of the in size. It was intended to fulfill the following roles:
To accomplish these missions the Navy expected a ship of or smaller, armed with eight and twelve guns, twelve anti-aircraft guns and one triple torpedo mount. It was to be armored to withstand 203 mm shells with a speed not less than , a range of at and able to carry four seaplanes launched by two catapults. Three preliminary designs were proposed in response, but only one, which displaced , was able to meet all of the requirements. However, the designers recommended an increase in the main armament caliber to , a strengthened anti-aircraft battery and reductions in the armor protection, speed, and range, but the start of Operation Barbarossa a month later rendered these plans moot.
The project was revived in 1943 with a new requirement issued on 15 September. This was basically identical to the original, but added one new requirement: "Protect the operations of aircraft carriers and conduct joint operations with them." Estimated characteristics were a displacement between , nine main guns between , a secondary battery of a dozen 130-mm dual-purpose guns and thirty-two 37-mm AA guns. The speed, range and aircraft requirements remained the same, although the torpedo tubes were dropped. Over a dozen preliminary designs had been proposed by May 1944, but none were acceptable. A new tactical requirement was issued in November 1944 that envisioned a more realistic displacement of while the speed was dropped to and the range to . Armament was also revised to nine 220-mm guns, sixteen 130-mm guns, thirty-two and twenty AA guns. These last guns were changed to in 1945.
Admiral Nikolai Kuznetsov believed that these ships could protect the planned Soviet aircraft carriers in bad weather from American cruisers and pushed to have them built, but the Shipbuilding Commissariat balked. It refused to begin detailed design work pleading the uncertainty of the post-war building situation and the already heavy workload of its design bureaux. Undeterred, the Navy continued studying cruiser designs and planned a ten-year construction programme for the period 1946–1955. This was based on defensive operations along the periphery of the Soviet Union against Anglo-American carrier groups while submarines would attack their lines of communication. Ten of these large cruisers were envisioned as part of this construction program. When the program was discussed by the Politburo on 29 September 1945 there was no great disagreement on the large cruisers, although Stalin favored increasing the size of their main guns to , but did not push the issue when Admiral Kuznetsov resisted.
A bigger problem was the resistance of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said it would be impossible to lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220-mm and 305-mm guns.
This was reaffirmed by a decree of the Council of Ministers on 28 January 1947. By August 1947, the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry had winnowed down design proposals to only three, one from each armed with 305 mm guns and a joint design armed with 220 mm guns. The latter's design was slightly smaller () than the Navy's design, and had an armor belt thinner, but was otherwise almost identical. The joint design was smaller with a reduced secondary armament, but was about faster. All proposals had a range of at . These designs weren't reviewed until March 1948, probably because of the need to coordinate reaction to the American Marshall Plan, and Stalin approved the Navy's more heavily protected design. But even this was subject to more delays as the detailed specifications had to be approved and this didn't occur until 31 August 1948, likely delayed by the Tito–Stalin split and the start of the Berlin Blockade, both in June.
With the approval of the specifications, TsKB-17, the heavy-ship design bureau, began work on the sketch design to be submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers before the start of the technical design could begin. By March 1949, four alternatives had been completed, differing mainly in the arrangement of the 130 mm guns and the boiler layout. The bureau preferred one layout and the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry concurred so the bureau began the technical design, without formal approval, in order to be ready to lay down the first two ships in the third quarter of 1950 as already scheduled. However, when Stalin reviewed the sketch design in September 1949, he rejected it, ordering a smaller, faster ship capable of . TsKB-17 was able to produce a preliminary technical design that met Stalin's demands by the end of the year, an amazingly fast amount of time for what should have been a very involved process. The most likely explanation is that the designers retained as much of their original work as possible and found room for the more powerful turbines and more numerous boilers necessary to attain Stalin's specified speed by deleting the two rear twin 130 mm turrets, and their magazines, as revealed by a comparison of the 1949 and 1951 sketches.
The Navy didn't like the compromises made to reduce the displacement down to Stalin's and to achieve the high speed demanded as revealed in a March 1950 meeting in the Kremlin where Stalin revealed critical points about his thoughts for these ships. When the admirals responded to his question about the purpose of these ships by saying that they were to fight the enemy's heavy cruisers, he contradicted them and said that their purpose was to fight light cruisers: "It is necessary to increase its speed to 35 knots and create a cruiser that will cause panic among the enemy's light cruisers, disperse and destroy them." Furthermore he believed that they would fight close to home, defending the coastal waters of Soviet Union. "You cannot blindly copy the Americans and English, they face different conditions, their ships travel far over the ocean, out of touch with their bases. We are not considering conducting oceanic battles, but instead will fight close to our own shores, so we do not need a large ammunition supply on the ship." The admirals also did not like the reduction in the secondary armament made to accommodate the larger machinery and extra boilers needed to reach the speed desired by Stalin, but he reminded them that most aircraft would attack the battlecruiser at heights below and the ceiling of the 130 mm was far in excess of that. He also ordered a reduction in the light anti-aircraft guns believing that its escorts would defend it. This design was approved by the Council of Ministers on 25 March 1950.
This allowed the technical design process to begin and it was completed in December 1950. Reviews by the Navy and Shipbuilding Ministries in February 1951 led to some significant changes to the design in April. The original form of the bow was similar to that of the light cruisers, but sea trials of the lead ship of that class in December 1950—January 1951 proved that she was very wet forward, which hindered her seakeeping ability. The "Stalingrad"s bow form was radically altered with a much more raked stem, its sheer and flare were greatly increased and the ship gained almost in length, possibly in response to the "Chapayev"s problems. In addition the thickness of her belt armor was increased from , possibly in response to weight savings elsewhere. This final design was submitted for approval on 4 June 1951, but preparations for the working design drawings began before it was approved.
Design.
General characteristics.
The ships of the "Stalingrad" class were long at the waterline, and long overall. They had a beam of , a maximum draft of forward, aft, and displaced at standard load and at full load. They were the first large Soviet-built ships with a flush deck. The hull was completely welded to save weight and they used longitudinal framing throughout. Metacentric height was estimated at , presumably in the design load condition. The ships had a triple bottom underneath the armored citadel that had a height of and 23 main watertight compartments. They had a crew of 1712 men plus space for 30 when acting as a flagship.
The cost for each ship was estimated at 1.168 billion rubles, almost four times the 322 million rubles for a . The ship was intended to be commanded by a rear admiral, with its executive officer, political officer and the heads of the gunnery and engineering divisions as captains 1st rank.
Propulsion.
The high speed demanded of the "Stalingrad"s required four TV-4 geared steam turbines, each producing and driving one propeller. They were powered by twelve water-tube boilers at a pressure of at a temperature of . The machinery was arranged on the unit system so that one hit couldn't knock out all the boilers or all the turbines and immobilize the ship. Two boiler compartments, each with three boilers, were situated underneath the forward funnel, with a turbine compartment for the wing shafts immediately aft and this arrangement was repeated for the two center shafts. of fuel oil were carried which gave a range of at . Maximum speed was .
Eight 750 kW turbo-generators drove the 380V, 50 Hz electrical system in addition to four 1000 kW Diesel generators located outside each end of the armored citadel for a total capacity of 10,000 kW.
Armor.
The armor scheme of the battlecruisers was quite complex with armor plates of no less than 25 different thicknesses used. Although only designed to withstand cruiser shellfire no less than , or 29% of the total displacement was devoted to armor. The citadel armor was intended to provide an immunity zone against armor-piercing shells at ranges between and . The remainder of the armor was intended to resist high explosive shells and HE bombs.
The belt armor was thick and inclined outwards at an angle of 15° to maximize its effectiveness against both plunging and horizontal fire. It had a vertical height of , of which was below the design waterline. It covered approximately 60% of the ship's waterline or about . of armor covered the hull side above the belt as protection from splinters. The forward end of the armored citadel was closed off by a thick transverse bulkhead on the forward end and aft. The deck armor in the citadel ranged in thickness, from for the upper deck, a middle deck—increased to over the handling rooms for the gun turrets—and a lower splinter deck of , which increased outboard to . The waterline forward of the citadel was protected by a splinter belt all the way to the bow, with a similar extension aft to the steering gear compartment. The middle deck behind this splinter belt was thick. The steering gear was protected by of armor on the sides, a deck and a armored bulkhead aft.
Additional armored plates were fixed to the third bulkhead of the underwater protection system to protect against diving shells hitting below the level of the waterline belt. Their thicknesses varied depending on location and ranged oddly from amidships to over the magazines. The main battery turrets were protected by of armor on the faces and on the sides and of armor on the roofs. Their barbettes had a maximum of on their forward faces and on the after face. Below the main deck they were protected by only of armor. The 130 mm turrets were only protected by of armor as splinter protection.
The forward conning tower had a forward face of that thinned down to on the aft section with a roof. Its controls and cable runs were protected by a tube and the lower part of the conning tower's supporting structure was protected with plates. Aft there was a lightly protected auxiliary control station with sides. Between the middle and lower decks the funnel uptakes were protected by of armor and between the upper and middle decks. A upper and lower grating protected the boilers from shells and fragments entering through the uptake openings.
The torpedo protection system was developed on the basis of model tests and full-scale trials using the incomplete hull of the prewar battlecruiser "Kronshtadt" and was expected to resist a torpedo warhead equivalent to of TNT. It was made up of an external bulge with four longintudinal bulkheads. The first was thick, the second was , the third was and the fourth . Presumably the thinner thicknesses were at the ends of the ships where the bulkheads were squeezed together. The outer space was left empty, but the two middle spaces were filled with oil that was intended to be exchanged with sea water as it was consumed, and the inner space was also to be left empty. One curious feature was that the first and second bulkheads were concave in profile. Apparently this was believed to improve their protective qualities, although there is no indication of how it did this. "The total depth of the system was about amidships, which seems rather shallow." The triple bottom underneath the armored citadel was believed to protect the ship against a charge equivalent to of TNT five meters below the ship's hull.
Armament.
Rather than use the Tsarist-era MK-3-12 gun as originally planned, or use the 305-mm/54 guns ordered for the "Kronstadt", it was decided in 1947 to adopt a new and more powerful 61-caliber gun of the same size that was to use three newly designed triple SM-6 turrets. Each individual gun weighed and the complete turret weighed . The guns could be depressed to −4° and elevated to 50° at a rate of 10° per second. Traverse speed was 4.5° per second and each turret was ordinarily remotely controlled from the More-82 main fire control director, but could be locally controlled if necessary. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of around using of propellant. Their rate of fire was 3.26 rounds per minute and 80 rounds were stowed aboard for each gun. One barrel was completed in December 1953 for evaluation purposes after the ships were canceled earlier that year.
The 130-mm 58-caliber guns were also a new design. They were to be fitted in a new twin-gun BL-109A dual-purpose mount. Each individual gun weighed and the complete turret weighed . The guns in this mount could depress to -8° and elevate to 83° at a rate of 20° a second. Traverse speed was 20° per second. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum horizontal range of using of propellant. Their rate of fire was 15 rounds per minute and 200 rounds were stowed for each gun.
Twenty-four 78-caliber light anti-aircraft guns were to be carried by the "Stalingrad"s in six quadruple SM-20-ZIF power-driven, fully enclosed mounts. Two mounts were fitted on each side of the forward funnel and the last two were superimposed above the rear main gun turret. Each individual gun weighed and the complete mount weighed . The guns in this mount could depress to -13° and elevate to 85° at a rate of 25° a second. Traverse speed was 30° per second. The gun fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum horizontal range of . Its rate of fire was 75 rounds per minute and 800 rounds were carried for each gun.
Forty 79-caliber AA guns were carried in ten quadruple powered BL-120 mounts. These were designed especially for the "Stalingrad"s and were fully, if lightly, armored against splinters. Each individual gun weighed and the complete mount weighed . The guns in this mount could depress to -5° and elevate to 90° at a rate of 25° a second. Traverse speed was 70° per second. The gun fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum effective range of . Its effective rate of fire was 240 rounds per minute and 1200 rounds were carried for each gun.
Electronics.
Target data for the "More-82" director was derived from the Zalp (NATO designation Half Bow) fire-control radar and Grot rangefinding radars mounted on turrets Nos. 2 and 3. These were backed up by a single KDP-8-10 optical director mount fitted with and rangefinders. Some of the BL-109A mounts were to fitted for range-finding radars, probably Shtag-B (NATO designation Egg Cup), but they were ordinarily controlled by three SPN-500 directors, one for each pair of gun mounts. The SPN-500s carried a rangefinder as well as Yakor (NATO designation Sun Visor) fire-control radar. Air search capability was provided by the Fut-N (NATO designation Slim Net) radar with anti-aircraft fire control provided by Fut-B (NATO designation Hawk Screech) radars.
The main air-search radar was the Giuis-2 (NATO designation Cross Bird), a Soviet development of the wartime British Type 291 radar. It had a range of against aerial targets and against surface targets. The main surface-search radar was Rif-A (NATO designation Ball End) that had a range of against surface targets. The "Stalingrad"s also had Neptun and Nord navigational radars. Soviet electronics were still fairly primitive during this period and the trials of the light cruiser "Sverdlov", which carried many of these systems, revealed that the effective range of the Rif-A surface-search radar was less than that of the Yakor and Zalp fire-control radars. There were also problems transferring data from the Giuis-2 air-search radar to the Yakor and Fut-B anti-aircraft fire-control radars, which was a serious problem when dealing with high-speed aircraft. The Giuis-2 also interfered with ultra-shortwave radio reception.
Korall radar-jammers were mounted on either side of the mainmast as well as a Machta system on the foremast. Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried on either side of the superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.
Missile variant.
The TsKB-17 design bureau proposed variants of the design with both cruise and ballistic missiles. The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of preparation time.
Construction.
Three ships were started:
The first sections of "Stalingrad" had been laid down in November 1951 in Slipway "O" of the Marti South Shipyard in Nikolayev where a , "Sovetskaya Ukraina", had begun construction in 1938, but the slipway itself was in need of reconstruction and its lower end was occupied by the hull of the "Sverdlov"-class light cruiser "Mikhail Kutuzov" which was scheduled for launch at the end of 1952. "Moskva"s keel was laid down in September 1952 by the Baltic Works in Leningrad. The unnamed third ship was laid down at Yard 402, at Molotovsk around October 1952, Soviet sources refer to her proposed names as the "Kronshtadt" or "Arkhangelsk". A fourth ship was apparently ordered from Yard 402, but was never laid down.
"Stalingrad"s formal keel-laying was on 31 December 1951 and it was hoped that she could be launched on 6 November 1953, the eve of the 36th anniversary of the October Revolution. But deliveries of steel, armor, machinery and other equipment were delayed or arrived out of sequence, despite extraordinary efforts by the Ministry of Shipbuilding, and slowed construction enough so that she fell about six months behind schedule and the same was more or less true for the other ships. By 1 January 1953 "Stalingrad" was intended to be 42.9% complete, but was actually only 18.8% done. "Moskva" was planned to be 11.5% finished, but was only 7.5% done. And the unnamed ship was intended to be 5.2% along, but was only 2.5% complete.
These ships were canceled on 18 April 1953, after Stalin's death on 5 March, by the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machinery, and the hulls of "Moskva" and the third ship were scrapped on the slipways later that year. The Ministry ordered in June that "Stalingrad"s hull, which was about 70% ready for launching, be used for weapons tests. Her hull was launched on 16 April 1954 and her stern, which was more or less complete, was dismantled—her bow hadn't been built when work was suspended a year earlier—and the central, long, section was modified for her new role.
Career as a target hulk.
"Stalingrad"s hull was towed from Nikolayev on 19 May 1955 by three tugs, but was driven ashore by high winds on 23 May at the southern entrance to Sevastopol Bay. She grounded on a very rocky bottom in very shallow water only about from shore. A number of the ordinary methods to refloat a ship couldn't be used because she was very nearly empty and so nothing could be off-loaded and the rocky bottom meant that it couldn't be excavated out from underneath her. The first attempt used brute force provided by the cruisers and "Kerch" to unsuccessfully tow her off. Several other attempts were made using explosive charges to create shock waves that would pivot her stern into deeper water in combination with tugs attempting to pull her around, but these were counterproductive in that several holes were blown in her sides which flooded several compartments and grounded her that much more firmly. At this time a more detailed assessment was made of the situation and 259 steel projections were discovered on the underside of her hull, left over from her launching cradles. These ranged in length from and totally invalidated all calculations about the amount of force required to free her.
The capsizing of the battleship "Novorossiysk" in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on the "Stalingrad" until the end of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted "Sverdlov"-class cruiser "Admiral Nakhimov" in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.

Wisdom (film)

Wisdom is a 1986 American crime film written and directed by its star Emilio Estevez in his filmmaking debut. The film also stars Demi Moore, along with Tom Skeritt and Veronica Cartwright as Estevez's parents. The end credits song is "Home Again" by Oingo Boingo and the score by Danny Elfman.
Plot.
John Wisdom is a young man just out of college. He's branded a felon after a grand theft auto conviction on the night of his high school graduation, and as a result can't hold down a decent job. Seeing little future for himself, Wisdom takes a left turn: he becomes a criminal "for the people," evocative of Robin Hood. After seeing news reports about all the impoverished farmers and working class being sent to the bank to pay ownership debts, Wisdom goes on a bank robbing spree with his girlfriend, Karen Simmons; they erase loan and mortgage records, buying time for the poor to pay their debts.
With the FBI after them, things take a turn for the worse when a panicky Karen murders a local sheriff. She and Wisdom make a run for the Canadian border, but when Karen is shot by a police helicopter, Wisdom leaves her in the care of some high school students and their teacher. He resumes his flight, but is surrounded by police and federal agents at a college football field. As Wisdom appears to be reaching for his gun, he is riddled with gunfire and dies.
John wakes up where the film started, in his parents' bathroom. He emerges from the shower and proceeds to get ready for his job interview. His entire story has apparently been a daydream.
Reception.
The film was not popular with critics; Leonard Maltin considered it "wretchedly scripted, with one of the most self-defeating wrap-ups you'll ever see."
Home media.
In March 2009, Warner Bros. announced "Wisdom" would be available as one of the films in its special "Warner Archive" promotion. The film could be special ordered on DVD or downloaded directly to PC.

Automaton clock

An automaton clock or automata clock is a type of striking clock featuring automatons. Clocks like these were built from the 1st century BC through to Victorian times in Europe. A Cuckoo clock is a simple form of this type of clock.
The first known mention is of those created by the Roman engineer Vitruvius, describing early alarm clocks working with gongs or trumpets. Later automatons usually perform on the hour, half-hour or quarter-hour, usually to strike bells. Common figures in older clocks include Death (as a reference to human mortality), Old Father Time, saints and angels. In the Regency and Victorian eras, common figures also included royalty, famous composers or industrialists.
More recently constructed automaton clocks are widespread in Japan, where they are known as "karakuri-dokei". Notable examples of such clocks include the Nittele Ōdokei, designed by Hayao Miyazaki to be affixed on the Nippon Television headquarters in Tokyo, touted to be the largest animated clock in the world. In the United Kingdom, Kit Williams produced a series of large automaton clocks for a handful of British shopping centres, featuring frogs, ducks and fish.

Dye pack

A dye pack is a radio-controlled incendiary device used by some banks to preemptively foil a bank robbery by causing stolen cash to be permanently marked with dye shortly after a robbery. 
In most cases, a dye pack is placed in a hollowed-out space within a stack of banknotes, usually $10 or $20 bills. This stack of bills looks and feels similar to a real one, with technology allowing for the manufacturing of flexible dye packs which are difficult to detect by handling the stack.
When the marked stack of bills is not used, it is stored next to a magnetic plate near a bank cashier, in standby or safe mode, ready to be handed over to a potential robber by a bank employee. When it is removed from the magnetic plate, the pack is armed, and once it leaves the building and passes through the door frame, a radio transmitter located at the door will trigger a timer (typically 10 seconds), after which the dye pack will explode and release an aerosol (usually of Disperse Red 9) and sometimes tear gas, intended to permanently stain and destroy the stolen money and mark the robber's body with a bright red color. The chemical reaction causing the explosion of the pack and the release of the dye creates high temperatures of about which further discourages a criminal from touching the pack or removing it from the bag or getaway vehicle.
Dye packs are used in over 75% of banks in America.

1st Parachute Army (Wehrmacht)

The German 1st Parachute Army (1st "Fallschirm-Armee") was formed in September 1944 to consolidate the various "Luftwaffe" "Fallschirmjäger"-Units and the Luftwaffe Field Division. It was given the task of defending the 60 mile stretch of the Low Countries between Antwerp and Maastricht with a force of just over 3,000 men.
History.
Its first commander was Colonel General Kurt Student, the "Wehrmacht"s airborne pioneer. During the Allied Operation Market Garden, Student's men played a vital role in delaying the Allied advance across the south of the Netherlands. The 3,000 paratroopers were likely the only combat-ready reserve forces in Germany at the time.
Student was transferred to the Eastern Front, and on 18 November 1944, command of the First Parachute Army passed to General der Fallschirmtruppe Alfred Schlemm, who opposed the Canadian First Army during the Battle of the Reichswald. Schlemm's troops were a motley but effective collection of under-strength infantry divisions and battle groups entrenched in the West Wall (Siegfried Line). Schlemm disagreed with the current view that the next Allied attack would be further south and ensured that his troops built formidable defences.
The Canadian First Army and Lieutenant-General William Hood Simpson’s U.S. Ninth Army compressed Schlemm’s forces into a small bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine opposite Wesel. On 10 March 1945, the rearguard of the 1st Fallschirm-Armee evacuated their bridgehead, destroying the bridge behind them, and Schlemm prepared to meet the inevitable Allied crossing of the river. Schlemm was wounded in an air attack on his command post at Haltern eleven days later and on 20 March 1945, command passed to General der Infanterie Günther Blumentritt.
Just before Operation Varsity, First Parachute Army had three corps stationed along the river; II Parachute Corps to the north, LXXXVI Corps in the centre, and LXIII Corps in the south. Of these formations, II Parachute Corps and LXXXVI Corps had a shared boundary which ran through the proposed landing-zones for the Allied airborne divisions, meaning that the leading formation of each corps would face the airborne assault — these being 7th Parachute Division and 84th Infantry Division. After their retreat to the Rhine both divisions were under-strength and did not number more than 4,000 men each, with 84th Infantry Division supported by only 50 or so medium artillery pieces.
In the final days of the war, command passed once more to Student (10 April) and finally to Erich Straube.

Joseph P. Bergl (1901-September 1950) was a mechanic who supplied specially designed vehicles for Chicago's underworld including Al Capone's Chicago Outfit to Depression-era outlaws George "Machine Gun" Kelly and members of the Barker Gang. 
Operating from his garage Bergl Auto Sales on 22nd Street, next to Ralph "Bottles" Capone's "Cotton Club", Bergl would supply Capone's organization with custom made cars for both protection and evasion purposes including armor plated vehicles with bulletproof windows as well as creating oil slicks, smokescreens, and other devices designed to elude police pursuit. 
Members of the Barker Gang used such a car robbing Federal Reserve Bank messengers at Jackson Boulevard on September 22, 1933. After a patrolman was killed, the gang fled the scene with a load of canceled checks and eventually forced to abandon their car after crashing it. 
Upon finding the wrecked car, police traced the vehicle to Bergl's shop and arrested Gus Winkler, member of the Chicago Outfit and Bergl's silent partner, naming the Chicago gangster of being a member of a national armed robbery syndicate, supposedly including Depression-era bandits George "Machine Gun" Kelly and Vernon Miller. 
Winkler would be killed in a gangland slaying by unidentified gunmen on October 9, reportedly suspecting Winkler would turn states evidence in exchange for reducing the long prison sentence faced by the charges. Although Bergl was allowed to live, the exposure to law enforcement officials ended his usefulness to the crime syndicate as criminals would turn to competitor Clarence Lieder.

Etymologicum Genuinum

The Etymologicum Genuinum (standard abbreviation E Gen) is the conventional modern title given to a lexical encyclopedia compiled at Constantinople in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compilator drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and scholiasts, both ancient and recent, including Aelius Herodianus, Georgius Choeroboscus, Saint Methodius, Orion of Thebes, Oros of Alexandria and Theognostus the Grammarian. The "Etymologicum Genuinum" was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around Photius. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the "Etymologicum Magnum", "Etymologicum Gudianum" and "Etymologicum Symeonis". 
Modern scholarship discovered the "Etymologicum Genuinum" only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century manuscripts, "codex Vaticanus graecus" 1818 (= A) and "codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci" 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest recension nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by Richard Reitzenstein, who was the first to edit a sample section. The "Etymologicum Genuinum" remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses. Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by Ada Adler and continued by Klaus Alpers, the other by François Lasserre and Nikolaos Livadaras. The latter edition is published under the title "Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum", but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the "Etymologicum Magnum".

J-Men Forever

J-Men Forever is a 1979 comedy film by Philip Proctor and Peter 
Bergman of the Firesign Theatre. The film is a pastiche using film clips from Republic serials, re-dubbed with comic dialog to tell a tale of world conquest by sex, drugs and rock and roll.
In the film, the "Lightning Bug", embodied by garish villains from several serials, attempts to take over the world with rock and roll. He later adds sex and drugs when music alone doesn't work. He explains his changing appearance by saying, "I'm bringing all five of my costumes!" The Lightning Bug is voiced by legendary radio DJ M.G. Kelly (aka "Machine Gun" Kelly). 
Peter Bergman plays "The Chief" and Philip Proctor plays "Agent Barton". They appear in period-style black and white sequences that are used to frame the re-dubbed clips of car chases, explosions, flying men, sinister villains and villainesses, fights, and various other perils that are strung together in a somewhat incoherent plot.
Synopsis.
The Bug's first victims are square record moguls "Lawrence Milk" and "Jive Davis", who are hypnotized or otherwise prodded into killing themselves, and bandleader Scream' Dorsey", whose car is boobytrapped and then run off a cliff. The Bug, his henchmen and henchwomen (including the villainess "Sombra") are opposed by the J-Men"', a group of government agents hired by the legendary "J. Eager Believer". 
Besides the Chief and his bumbling sidekick, Agent Barton, the J-Men include Agents "Spike", "Claire" and "Lance", "Buzz Cufflink", "James Armhole", "Rocket Jock" (clips from a "Commando Cody" serial), the "Lone Star" (clips from a "Captain America" serial), the "Caped Madman" (clips from "Captain Marvel"), "Spy Swatter" (clips from "Spy Smasher"), "Sleeve Coat", "Juicy Withers", and "Admiral Balzy". Many of them appear to die horrible, inescapable deaths in the course of the film.
The J-Men work in cooperation with the "F.C.C. (Federal Culture Control)", opposing the Lightning Bug with "Muzac" (created by "M.U.S.A.C., the Military Underground Sugared Airwaves Command"), then with a bomb to blow up the Lightning Bug's base on the Moon. However, the Lightning Bug beats them to it, by turning his stereo up too loud and blowing up the Moon himself. 
At the end of the film, Agent Barton mournfully recites the list of J-Men who supposedly gave their lives in the epic struggle against the Bug. The Chief laughs, then starts choking on a cigar he is smoking. After he stops choking, The Chief points out that J-Men are flexible enough to survive any life-threatening situation, and the final clips (from next week's edition of the serial) show exactly how each J-Man escaped their particular peril.
Soundtrack.
The movie soundtrack features music from Budgie, The Tubes, Head East and Billy Preston.

Piper PA-40 Arapaho

The Piper PA-40 Arapaho was an American twin-engined cabin monoplane designed by Piper as a replacement for the PA-39 Twin Comanche C/R.
Like most Piper products at this time, the PA-40 was named after a Native American tribe, in this case the Arapaho.
Development.
The Arapaho was similar in size to the Twin Comanche and had six seats but had a taller main landing gear and larger cabin windows. It had two counter-rotating 160 hp Lycoming IO-320 engines. 
The prototype was damaged in June 1972 when the factory at Lock Haven flooded and the prototype, registered "N9999P", did not fly until 16 January 1973. It crashed on 21 September 1973 during spin trials. and the aircraft was redesigned with a taller tailfin. The second modified prototype with normally aspirated engines first flew in April 1974 and was followed by a third aircraft with turbocharged engines. 
The PA-40 was type certified on 18 July 1974, as an amendment to the Twin Comanche type certificate. The Arapaho was scheduled to be launched as a 1975 model, but the company decided not to market the aircraft and the project was cancelled in December 1974. Piper stated that the cancellation was for financial reasons as it did not want to establish a new production line during an economic recession.
Following cancellation the two aircraft were used by Piper as company liaison and communication aircraft, one based at Lock Haven, the other at Lakeland. Later one aircraft was scrapped by Piper and the third, registered N9997P, is now used by Aviation Technology students at Purdue University in the airframe laboratory at the Purdue University Airport.

Amateur Softball Association

The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966.
The National Softball Hall of Fame and Museum is operated by the ASA and is located at 2801 NE 50th Street in Oklahoma City.
Since 2005, they have run the World Cup of Softball. ASA Hall of Fame Stadium also hosts the NCAA Women's College World Series and the Big 12 Conference softball championship.
ASA now runs competitions in every state through a network of 76 state and metro associations. It has a membership of over 230,000 teams, with more than 3 million players and 35,000 umpires.
National Team Program (USA Softball).
In 1978, the United States Olympic Committee named ASA the national governing body of softball. Due to this designation ASA is responsible for training, equipping and promoting Men’s, Women’s, Junior Boys’ and Junior Girls’ National Softball Teams in order to compete in international and domestic competitions. in 1996 The Women's Fast Pitch National Team became The first Team to compete in the Olympics. The ASA National Team program is also known as USA Softball.
ASA Youth Program.
The ASA youth program, also known as the Junior Olympic program, is among the nation's largest youth sports organization. Over 80,000 teams, 1.3 million players and 300,000 coaches participate in ASA youth softball on an annual basis. It is the single fastest growing program in the ASA, and has had membership growth every year since its inception in 1974.
ASA Adult Program.
The ASA adult program has served as the backbone of the association since its beginning in 1934. With over 170,000 teams, 2.5 millions players and 500,000 coaches involved on an annual basis, the adult program is the largest program within the Amateur Softball Association. The ASA provides varied programs of competition for adults including fast pitch, slow pitch and modified pitch for men and women. The ASA also offers programs in modified pitch and 16-inch slow pitch.
Registration and Membership.
The ASA uses its network of 76 local associations covering all 50 states to register its players, coaches, umpires, volunteers and other administrative members. An online application is available to teams and leagues to register their members.
ASA Championship Tournament Program.
Annually the ASA conducts over 90 National Championships in each of its major disciplines of the sport - slow, fast and modified pitch. Since each competitor must earn their berth into an ASA national through a network of qualifying tournaments conducted throughout the season, the champion goes home as the unchallenged best team in the nation for their respected division each year.
Qualifying for ASA National Championships begin at the local level with league championships, state championships and eventually national qualifiers. Each year over 30,000 players qualify to compete in an ASA National Championship. Cities from across America annually bid for these celebrated events, largely because of the economic impact they will make on their communities.
ASA Umpire Program.
The ASA umpire program is among the nation's largest officiating organizations with over 35,000 officials actively involved each year. ASA officials are nationally recognized as some of the best trained and proficient in the sport, and are involved in competitions which include league play, city, state and national championships. Ultimately, ASA umpires could officiate events such as world championship, Pan American and Olympic competitions. In some areas, select ASA umpires also umpire in little league baseball games.
ASA Certified Equipment.
The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) has taken great strides to protect the integrity of the sport. Each year, the ASA's equipment testing and specifications committee examines the current rules and specifications governing various items of equipment. This committee makes recommendations to the ASA's council composed of ASA commissioners, select youth and player representatives, umpire-in-chiefs, elite athletes and other affiliated members. The council is the ultimate decision maker of ASA rules and regulations regarding equipment. The ASA Softball official website features a complete listing of ASA certified equipment which most municipal park district and corporate leagues follow, to varying extents, as to what rules are adhered to and what equipment is allowed in play, especially bats.
National Softball Hall of Fame Museum.

Games for Change

Games for Change (also known as G4C) is a movement and community of practice dedicated to using digital games for social change. An individual game may also be referred to as a "game for change" if it is produced by this community or shares its ideals. "Games for Change" is also the name for the non-profit organization which is building the field by providing support, visibility, and shared resources to individuals and organizations using digital games for social change.
Overview.
Games for Change is often considered a branch of serious games focused on social issues and social change. Its members represent hundreds of non-profit directors, game developers, artists and academics—a network committed to social change through gaming.
History.
The movement first emerged as Games for Change at a Serious Issues, Serious Games' conference held at New York Academy of Sciences on June 8, 2004. The invitation-only event gathered 40+ foundations, academics and nonprofits for a day "to mobilize support for a medium with growing importance for nonprofits." The event was organized with the support of the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars and Serious Games Initiative, after several nonprofits at their December, 2003 gathering in Washington, DC noted the need for a dedicated space for those working on social change with nonprofit organizations. The NYC event served to jump-start the space, and was organized by Suzanne Seggerman of Web Lab, Benjamin Stokes of NetAid, Barry Joseph of Global Kids, David Rejeski of the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars and Thomas Lowenhaupt of the Queens Community Board.
The movement grew legs after the first gathering as it launched a listserv dedicated to games and social issues and began holding satellite events at various events, including the Game Developers Conference, the Serious Games Summit, Education Arcade at E3, Games and Learning Conference, Taicon and several others.
The annual Games for Change Festival has since been held in 2005 at CUNY and in 2006 with Parsons The New School for Design In 2011, the Festival moved to the Jack H. Skillball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.[
The organization.
Founded in 2004, Games for Change facilitates the creation and distribution of social impact games that serve as critical tools in humanitarian and educational efforts. It brings together organizations and individuals from the social impact sector, government, media, academia, the gaming industry, and the arts to grow the field, incubate new projects, and provide an open platform for the exchange of ideas and resources. It is the only non-profit dedicated to uniting the various parties needed to create and distribute successful social impact games. Games for Change specializes in bringing together funders, content specialists, learning experts, and creative teams to create successful and sustainable titles.
Games for Change acts as a catalyst for the creation of high quality, high impact educational and social change games while building and sharing replicable models for game funders, commissioners, and developers to use. These tools will advance the field and inspire private investment, greater adoption of by nonprofits and Government agencies, and widespread mainstream public participation. The work includes providing an entry point for game makers, content creators, and public sector entities that are new to the field. For the funding community, Games for Change shows signs of becoming a coordinating hub for collaborative investment and evaluation of social change games projects. Games for Change also strives to educate the philanthropic and corporate community, engage the public, and advocate for high-quality games.
One example of how Games for Change leverages the resources of major foundations is its relationship with the AMD Foundation. Games for Change was chosen to be the founding partner by the AMD Foundation for its signature education program, “Changing the Game”, which enriches the educational experience of young people aged 13 through 18. The initiative enables youth to learn critical STEM skills, become globally conscious citizens, and contribute solutions to social issues by creating their own games. The program now has added partners across the US and Asia, including Beijing Game Design Workshop & Technology Lab, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Malaysian Cybergames Festival 2010.
Games for Change has worked further with the AMD Foundation on initiatives to inspire youth engagement and support organizations in making and using games. “Let the Games Begin: A Toolkit 4 Making Social Issue Games” includes examples of social change games, interviews and video lectures by experts in the field, and guidance for individuals and organizations creating social issue games for the first time. Distributed online and as a DVD, it has reached tens of thousands of educators, individuals and organizations. “The Power of Design: Youth Making Social Issue Games” is a series of daylong workshops directed at educators to give an overview of game design platforms and successful youth game design curricula and programs. Partners and collaborators on the program included Global Kids, World Wide Workshop, PETLab, EDC/Center for Children & Technology, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Quest to Learn among others. This workshop has reached hundreds of educators and is set to reach thousands more via a partnership with Scholastic that will feature it on their website. The “101 Workshop” is another series of programs to make the case for social impact games and to support organizations and individuals who want to use digital games as a part of educational and outreach efforts. This workshop has reached over 5,000 educators and decision makers in the public sector, and will also reach many more via the Scholastic website.
Beyond these intensive, long-term relationships, Games for Change’s influence is also seen in the remarkably wide, cross-sector list of companies and organizations that have sought its advice: Hasbro, News Corp, Google Ideas, ABC News, Edelman, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the Special Olympics / North America, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, UN Foundation, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Millennium Promise, DoSomething.org, Ballard & Tighe Publishers, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fetzer Institute, Energy Solutions Foundation, Participant Media, Choices, The Rockefeller Foundation, Just Detention International, and Concerned Children’s Advertisers. And as the field’s leading advocate, Games for Change has been invited to present and speak at many important gatherings and think tanks, from TEDx to Harvard’s Kennedy School.
Current leadership.
Games for Change is able to build these strategic partnerships because of the experience its leadership brings from the gaming, independent media, nonprofit, and NGO worlds. Co-President Asi Burak has more than a decade of experience in the gaming industry, creating successful social impact games (including the award-winning "PeaceMaker" and "Play the News"), working with the private sector, individual investors, government agencies, incubators, and as an advocate for the field. An expert in the field, Asi has been invited to speak at numerous places including TEDTalks, NTEN, and Harvard’s Kennedy Center. Co-President Michelle Byrd served as Executive Director of Independent Filmmaker Project (IFP), building the IFP into the largest organization of independent filmmakers in the US; she was responsible for strategic partnerships (including the UN, New York Times, and Sundance Institute), and her work landed her on both Variety’s “Indie Impact List: 50 Who Made a Difference” and The Hollywood Reporter’s “Women in Entertainment Power 100” lists.
Games for Change is accountable to its board of directors, advisory board, funders, partners, peers in the field, and to the public. It shares its outcomes and reports to these stakeholders in several ways: it prepares reports and evaluations for funders and partners; informs the public and peers through its annual Festival, events, talks and Web site; and also shares results with peers through reports, whitepapers, and presentations.
The Games for Change Festival.
Since 2004, Games for Change has hosted the "Games for Change Festival" in New York. Often referred to as “the Sundance of Video Games”, the "Games for Change Annual Festival" is the biggest gaming event in New York City. It brings together leaders from government, corporations, philanthropy, civil society, media, academia, and the gaming industry to explore the increasing real-world impact of digital games as an agent for social change. In recent years, the "Games for Change Festival" has become the most important place to launch a new initiative because it is the best way to connect with the various stakeholders in the field. The festival also showcases some of the most innovative new games in production with its annual “Demo Spotlight,” which gives select game developers the opportunity to present their projects on the main stage of the festival to a panel of designers and funders for feedback.
The 8th Annual Festival (June 20–22, 2011) featured more than 40 hours of content: talks, game case studies, workshops, a live game arcade, the 2nd Annual Games for Change Awards Show, and social events. Vice President at the time, Al Gore delivered the opening keynote. Other featured speakers included Pulitzer Prize-winning author Sheryl WuDunn (""), Laura Pincus Hartman of Zynga.org, game guru Jesse Schell, and James H. Shelton III of the US Department of Education.
In 2013, the event featured a Hall of Fame to celebrate its 10th year. 5 Games were added that represent the best games in social impact for the last decade. The games were Hidden agenda game, Meritt Kopas's Lim, Lukas Pope's Papers, Please, Cheavvleir's Vigiliance 1.0 and Lindsay Grace's Critical Gameplay Wait.
Past festivals have included talks by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra, author and journalist Nicholas Kristof, and more. Past festival archive can be found at the organization’s festival page.
The Games for Change Awards.
The organization hosts the Annual Games for Change Awards held during the Games for Change Festival. The Awards recognize excellence in “games for change” that address current and pressing social issues. As of 2011, four awards are bestowed:
Past winners have included "Fate of the World", "Inside the Haiti Earthquake", and "EVOKE".
Case studies.
Games for Change collects a growing catalog of case studies on a variety of game projects. With in-depth data on project budgets, funding sources, distribution models, reach, and efficacy, these case studies offer games for change creators valuable insight into game production from concept to release. Case studies include such games as "iCivics", "PeaceMaker" and "Darfur is Dying".
International chapters.
Games for Change has gone global with several chapters hosted in different regions around the world.
In France, the Chamber of Commerce in Valenciennes supported the establishment of Games for Change Europe. Seeing an opportunity to link games with economic development, the government launched the first European Games for Change Festival in May 2011.
A newly formed Latin America chapter, headquartered in São Paulo, Brazil, is moving quickly to forge strategic partnerships, including ones with the Brazilian Association of the Game Industry and the Brazilian Computer Science Society.
The South Korean chapter of Games for Change has been going strong ever since its formation in 2007. The chapter has worked with the South Korean government to sponsor multi-million dollar game projects and hold annual game-making summer camps for youth.
Service to the community.
On the Play section of its website, Games for Change curates a “game arcade”: an ever-growing catalogue of serious and social impact games covering a wide range of topics, many of which are available to play online for free. The site includes video documentation from past Festivals, the “101 Workshop” and “Power of Design: Youth Making Social Issue Games Workshop”, links to blogs, research papers, and grant opportunities. The organization also shares a selection of resources for those interested in researching, creating, or funding games for change. These resources include useful websites and blogs, videos, essays, toolkits, and grant opportunities.
The Games for Change web site also offers several ways that people can get engaged or start on the path to creating a game. The downloadable “Make a Game for Change Toolkit” offers everything one needs to know to take the first steps. Neither a technical or design manual, it is an overview of the game-making process that presents some of the key topics to start with, how to begin the conversation both within an organization and with outside partners, emphasizing that creating a social impact game is a collaborative process that likely will require an experienced game designer and developer.
To help create a larger community of enthusiasts, Games for Change created the Games for Change Meetup Everywhere site, which enables anyone around the world to self-organize under the organization’s banner and access community tools to create their own Meetup events. Games for Change has created a toolkit that provides tips, techniques, and even a handy timeline to help individual organizers in putting together a successful event. Since its debut in October 2010, 52 communities have formed using this platform – from San Francisco to Bangalore – with members ranging from 4 to over 100. Successful self-organized Meetups are covered by the Games for Change blog and social media, so they can serve as a model for other to initiate their own events.
The Games for Change Lab.
Games for Change provides a suite of services to guide organizations and individuals that are actively pursuing games to further their public, philanthropic, or academic mission. The services seek to lift up the field of social impact games and can range from the modest to the comprehensive: concept workshops, help in a public “request for proposal” process, or support in the production and launch of a project. G4C guides the alignment of goals, audience, game platform, and distribution channels.
Through its high-profile initiative with partner foundations, government agencies, and nonprofits, Games for Change is establishing industry-wide standards including methodologies and assessment practices; publicizing outcomes and best practices; and creating and implementing replicable models of multi-stakeholder partnerships that can advance the entire field. Past and current projects include strategic advising for USAID for a global initiative that uses games to empower youth in the Middle East, the World Bank Learning Institute on a series of game projects aimed at policy makers in developing countries, and the American Museum of Natural History to develop game-related projects to address youth engagement with the sciences.
Additionally, Games for Change is in production on the Half the Sky project, a multi-million dollar transmedia project based on the best-selling book by Pulitzer Prize winning authors Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. The project aims to highlight the moral challenge of oppression of women around the world, teach young women how to unlock their economic power, and equally to present the opportunities women offer to promote economic and international development. Games for Change is working as the Executive Producer of the game component, cooperating with several partners to develop a global Facebook game and mobile games for audiences in India and Africa. Funders of the transmedia project include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, USAID, the Ford Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and ITVS.
For organizations developing more ambitious projects, Games for Change assists in the development of a “game technology engine,” a concept taken from the commercial industry. The “game engine” enables the developer to alter the content and interface while keeping most of the core technology and code. A game commissioner can think in terms of a portfolio of games, and rather than build every game from scratch – for different regions or constituencies – can efficiently create iterations of a game similar to how the commercial industry generates game sequels.
Games for Change is guiding the investment of over $8 million into social change games that have the potential to reach over 50 million people. In addition, adoption of Games for Change’s methodology and assessment protocols by major organizations is laying the groundwork for further investment and the establishment of field-wide standards that will continue this trend. Games for Change’s work defining these standards and approaches is having a broad impact on the development of social change games, how games are incorporated into educational initiatives, and how games are evaluated.
More information about Games for Change and social impact games at large can be found on the organization’s blog, in their newsletter, in addition to Twitter and Facebook pages. The Games for Change community also hosts Meetups and connects via the Games for Change Google Group.

<doc id="5977757" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977757" title="Backup camera">
Backup camera

A backup camera is a special type of video camera that is produced specifically for the purpose of being attached to the rear of a vehicle to aid in backing up, and to alleviate the rear blind spot. Backup cameras are alternatively known as 'reversing cameras' or 'rear view cameras'. It is specifically designed to avoid a Backup collision. The area directly behind vehicles has been described as a "killing zone" due to the associated carnage.
The design of a backup camera is distinct from other cameras in that the image is horizontally flipped so that the output is a mirror image. This is necessary because the camera and the driver face opposite directions, and without it, the camera's right would be on the driver's left and vice versa. A mirrored image makes the orientation of the display consistent with the physical mirrors installed on the vehicle. A backup camera typically sports a wide-angle or fisheye lens. While such a lens spoils the camera's ability to see faraway objects, it allows the camera to see an uninterrupted horizontal path from one rear corner to the other. The camera is typically pointed on a downward angle, to view potential obstacles on the ground as well as the position of approaching walls and docks, rather than straight back.
Backup cameras are common on vehicles that tow difficult-to-see trailers, such as motorhomes. Recently, with the rise in popularity of in-dash DVD players and GPS navigation systems which aid in justifying the expense of adding a color LCD display to the driver's seat, they have become much more common, often available as optional factory accessories on standard passenger trucks and sport utility vehicles, as well as aftermarket accessories. Inside the vehicle, the display is typically wired to automatically sense when the transmission is set in reverse, showing the backup view while in reverse, and showing the map (or other content) at all other times.
Variations.
Backup cameras are produced in different varieties depending on the application.
Others.
Other types of camera systems can give a more comprehensive view. In 2007 Nissan introduced their "Around View Monitor" which uses four cameras to give a birds eye view of the vehicle. Other automobile manufactures have since offered similar systems, BMW introduced their system in 2009 on the F10 5-series.
Blind spot monitors and other technology.
Blind spot monitors are an option that may include more than monitoring the sides of the vehicle. It can include "Cross Traffic Alert," "which alerts drivers backing out of a parking space when traffic is approaching from the sides."
Examples.
The first back up camera was used in the 1956 Buick Centurion concept car, presented in January 1956 at the General Motors Motorama. The vehicle had a rear mounted television camera that sent images to a TV screen in the dashboard in place of the rear-view mirror. The first production automobile to incorporate a back up camera was the 1991 Toyota Soarer Limited (UZZ31 & UZZ32), which was only available for the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) and not on its U.S. counterpart, the Lexus SC. The Toyota system used a colour EMV screen, with a rear spoiler mounted CCD camera. The system was discontinued in 1997. In April 2000, Nissan's Infiniti luxury division introduced the RearView Monitor on the 2002 Q45 flagship sedan at the 2000 New York International Auto Show. Introducing coloured onscreen guide lines as a parking distance parameter, the RearView Monitor operated from a license-plate mounted camera in the trunk, that transmitted a mirrored image to an in-dash (7 inch) LCD screen. It was available as optional equipment upon North American market launch in March 2001. The 2002 Nissan Primera introduced the RearView Monitor back up camera system to territories outside Japan and North America.
Law.
In the United States, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 required the federal Secretary of Transportation to issue backup collision safety regulations within 3 years and require full compliance within 4 years after final rulemaking. As of 2012, regulations are still under study. About half of model year 2012 automobiles already have backup cameras installed.
The Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act was passed to mandate increased rear visibility on automobiles sold in the United States, it has been delayed by the NHTSA on four separate occasions. NHTSA estimates the cost at $58 to $203 depending on whether the vehicle already comes standard with an interior display. Consumers Union filed a lawsuit in September 2013 to force action, saying the NHTSA has delayed the laws implementation excessively.
In March 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it would require all new automobiles to have backup cameras by 2018. Manufacturers are petitioning that backup cameras replace mirrors to reduce drag and improve fuel economy of their vehicles.

Marcel Jouhandeau

Marcel Jouhandeau (July 26, 1888–April 7, 1979) was a French writer.
Biography.
Born in Guéret, Creuse, Marcel Jouhandeau grew up in a world of women presided over by his grandmother. Under the influence of a young woman from the Carmel of Limoges, he embraced a mystical form of Catholicism and for a time thought to enter the orders. However, in 1908 he left for Paris where he studied first at the Lycée Henri-IV, and then at the Sorbonne where he began to write. In 1912 he became a professor in a school at Passy.
As a very young man, Marcel Jouhandeau discovered his homosexual feelings, which provoked great guilt as offensive to God. Still, his feelings of shame did not prevent him from engaging in numerous homosexual acts and his whole life alternated between a celebration of the male body and mortification of sexuality. In 1914, during a mystical crisis, he burned his manuscripts and attempted suicide. Once the crisis had passed, he turned again to writing and created the village chronicles which brought him his first literary successes. 
During World War I, he was initially a secretary in his hometown of Guéret. In 1924 he published "Pincegrain", a barely disguised chronicle of the inhabitants of Guéret, which shocked the people of the town. His voyages became an opportunity for him to give himself over to his love of men, as he recounted in the "Amateur d'imprudences". 
At age 40, he married a dancer, Élisabeth Toulemont, known as Caryathis « Elyse », the former mistress of Charles Dullin and an intimate friend of Jean Cocteau and Max Jacob. She hoped to rid him of his homosexual leanings. During this period he undertook a work of Christian moralism ("De l'abjection") before tumbling again into the arms of men—much to the dismay of his wife—which he wrote about in "Chronique d'une passion" and "Eloge de la volupté". 
Nevertheless Jouhandeau and his wife adopted a girl named Céline, who gave birth to a baby boy, Marc. Following the death of Élise in 1971, Jouhandeau finished his last days in Rueil-Malmaison with Marc.
Jouhandeau has been described as antisemitic. He wrote an anti-Jewish lampoon, "Le Péril Juif", in 1938.

R. v. Darrach

R. v. Darrach, 2 S.C.R. 443, 2000 SCC 46, is a leading case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada on the constitutionality of the Criminal Code of Canada's rape shield law. The Court upheld the law.
Background.
In 1994 Andrew Darrach, an Ottawa resident, was charged with sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend. At trial he attempted to introduce evidence of his ex-girlfriend's sexual history. A voir dire, required under the rape shield law in section 276 of the "Criminal Code of Canada" to consider whether the evidence is admissible, was carried out. The judge refused to admit the evidence after Darrach refused to be cross-examined on his affidavit. Darrach was sentenced to nine months in jail. An initial appeal was dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Darrach argued that he was denied a fair trial as he was unable to present evidence that he mistakenly believed that the ex-girlfriend had consented. He also argued that his right to silence and right against self-incrimination were violated by the requirement to testify at the voir dire. 
Opinion of the Court.
Justice Gonthier, writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the Criminal Code of Canada provisions. He found that requiring the complainant to testify would be unnecessarily invasive and would discourage victims from reporting such incidents.
Gonthier also found that Darrach's right to avoid self-incrimination was not infringed by the requirement for him to testify regarding his voir dire affidavit, because the accused made the voluntary decision to have the voir dire carried out. The decision to have the voir dire, and by extension the requirement to submit an affidavit and accept cross-examination, was voluntarily made by Darrach. Any testimony at the voir dire would have solely been to determine the admissibility of the evidence Darrach wished to submit, and would have been unusable in the trial itself.

International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

IPSN, the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, is an academic conference on sensor networks with its main focus on information processing aspects of sensor networks. IPSN draws upon many disciplines including signal and image processing, information and coding theory, networking and protocols, distributed algorithms, wireless communications, machine learning, embedded systems design, and data bases and information management.
IPSN Events.
IPSN started in 2001, and following is a list of IPSN events from 2001 to 2014:
Ranking.
Although there is no official ranking of academic conferences on wireless sensor networks,
IPSN is widely regarded by researchers as one of the two (along with SenSys) most prestigious conferences focusing on sensor network research. SenSys focuses more on system issues while IPSN on algorithmic and theoretical considerations. The acceptance rate for 2006 was 15.2% for oral presentations, 25% overall (25 papers +17 poster presentations, out of 165 submissions accepted).
History.
IPSN started off as a workshop at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 2001, and it was initially called "Collaborative Signal Processing Workshop" (CSP Workshop). Following the success of the first event, in 2003, the workshop defined its focus more on sensor networks and was renamed "International Workshop on Information Processing in Sensor Networks" (IPSN). The event kept the name acronym IPSN from 2003 onwards but the full name changed from "International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks" (2003 - 2004) to "International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks" (2005 - 2007). It is expected that IPSN would keep the full name "International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks" for the coming years.
SPOTS Track.
In 2005 IPSN introduced a separate track on Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS) to the conference. The focus of the IPSN track is more on information processing algorithms, and the focus of SPOTS track is on platform tools and design methods for network embedded sensors.

<doc id="5977844" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977844" title="Strings (tennis)">
Strings (tennis)

In tennis, the strings are the part of a tennis racquet which make contact with the ball. The strings form a woven network inside the head (or "hoop") of the racquet. Strings have been made with a variety of materials and possess varying properties that have been measured, such as dynamic stiffness, tension retention, thickness (gauge), string texture (shape of the string), and rebound efficiency.
Composition.
The material used in tennis string can significantly affect a player's performance, and even health. Several materials are used to make tennis strings. They vary in terms of elasticity, durability, rebound efficiency, tension holding capability, and manufacturing cost, among other considerations.
Natural Gut.
Animal intestine is the most resilient material used to make tennis strings. It has better tension retention than any other material, and also is softer than any other material used for tennis strings. It provides the most energy return, meaning it is the most efficient string. It remains soft at high tensions while other materials tend to stiffen dramatically. This allows gut string to enable players to string rather tightly to improve ball control without losing much rebound efficiency (power) and without greatly increasing impact shock, which can hurt the elbow and other joints. 
Its principal drawbacks are much higher cost to manufacture and purchase than other materials, weakness to shear stresses from off-center hits (typical of beginning players), variable quality control depending upon the brand, batch, age, storage conditions, and grade, difficulty of stringing due to its delicacy, and poor durability when wetted with water. Natural gut is very sensitive to different types of weather and those players who use it normally carry several different racquets with different tensions to compensate for this. Some players, particularly those who hit flat shots and hit the sweet spot consistently, find high-quality gut to be more durable than many other types of strings due to its outstanding tension retention. This may help to offset the high initial cost. The use of a dense string pattern also generally improves the longevity of natural gut.
Natural gut is produced by drying fibers extracted from a part of the cow intestine called the serous membrane, or serosa, which contains collagen designed to withstand the stretching and contraction of the intestine. It is this elasticity that makes the fibers useful for tennis string. Sheep intestines have also been used for racquet strings in the past.
The first natural gut tennis string was rumored to be manufactured in 1875 by Pierre Babolat, who would launch the VS brand of gut fifty years later. Natural gut is usually offered in coated form, to reduce its tendency to unravel, particularly when humid or wet.
Synthetic Gut.
Synthetic gut is nylon, nearly always composed of a single filament. It is a very inexpensive string to manufacture and is generally the least expensive string to purchase. 
Small changes from pure nylon are usually found in strings sold as "synthetic gut". Textured coatings, colorants, and the addition of a small amount of Kevlar are the most common changes. Some manufacturers, such as Gosen, label nylon strings with words like "sheep", as in sheep intestine, although such strings contain no gut.
Synthetic gut, as it is used for mono-filament nylon strings, is now a misnomer, as the creation of multi-filament strings has provided players with a better approximation of natural gut's performance. Modern "synthetic gut" is actually a multi-filament string that holds its tension extremely well and which has a dynamic stiffness profile that is closest to natural gut, although the industry continues to apply the term to mono-filament nylon strings.
Multi-filament, or "Multi".
Multi-filament strings, known commonly as "multis" are strings that have more than one filament. They are most commonly made of many filaments of nylon, but can incorporate other materials such as polyurethane, Zyex, Vectran, Kevlar, and other materials. Multi-filament strings offer better elasticity than single filament strings, but usually inferior durability. No multi-filament string holds its tension as well as natural gut, and none of them is as soft. 
However, in comparison to mono-filament "synthetic gut", multi-filament strings can offer a much closer approximation of natural gut's performance. The softest multi-filament strings can be made with Zyex and polyolefin, although some of the softest of these strings are no longer on the market.
Nylon.
Nylon is the most popular string material for amateur players due to its low cost and the improvement in elasticity offered by multi-filament strings. Wear-resistant coatings for nylon strings are common, especially with multi-filament strings, because the outer filaments tend to break first as the racquet is used.
Polyester.
Polyester is a stiff and durable string material, originally intended for use by frequent string breakers. It took the string time to become popular, primarily due to its poor tension holding capability. However, players feel they are able to apply more topspin to balls while maintaining control with polyester strings. Polyester's support for heavy topspin in particular has made it the most popular material in the pro tour. The increased topspin due to polyester strings has been verified with controlled experiments. The exact cause for the increased spin is not known but there is strong evidence that the low friction between strings is a factor.
Kevlar.
Kevlar is the stiffest, most durable synthetic string available, and is thus extremely hard to break. Although it is one of the best strings in terms of tension holding capability (next to natural gut), it is the most dangerous string when it comes to developing tennis elbow. Kevlar is often strung with another string, such as nylon), in order to combine both strings' qualities, as Kevlar by itself feels too stiff for many tennis players, especially when combined with a stiff racquet. Some advocate using a very thin gauge Kevlar for increasing comfort, but even in the thinnest gauge it is a stiff string. Another strategy to increase comfort and improve rebound efficiency is to string Kevlar at a low tension.
Vectran.
Vectran is the penultimate string in terms of stiffness and durability. It is perhaps the least commonly used contemporary string material. It is usually added to nylon string to increase nylon's durability and stiffness, as with Kevlar. Yonex, for instance, offers two badminton strings, made primarily from nylon, which have Vectran strands. However, the Ashaway company offers a braided Vectran tennis string.
Zyex.
Zyex string offers more rebound efficiency, i.e. gut-like dynamic stiffness, than other synthetic strings, particularly when strung at low tensions. This gives it playability that is more similar to natural gut than, arguably, other synthetic materials. It also has low overall stiffness. The ProKennex IQ Element Z string, for instance, has the lowest stiffness of any synthetic string yet tested. The drawback of Zyex is that the outer wrapping materials in Zyex tennis string tend to be much less durable than the Zyex filaments inside the string and do not bond with them. This can lead to the outer wrapping wearing away, leaving the inner Zyex filaments.
Polyolefin.
Polyolefin is one of the softest synthetic string materials, rivaling some Zyex and most nylon multi-filaments. It offers mediocre durability and tension retention, so it is generally used as the cross string in a hybrid string setup. For those who do not break strings very quickly, however, 100% polyolefin stringing may be a good alternative to natural gut and multi-filament strings. This is especially true for those who have had tennis elbow and find natural gut string to be too costly.
Metal wire.
Metal wire, usually piano wire, was used in some historical racquets.
The Gauge.
The "gauge" number determines the thickness of the string. A string rated with a high gauge number is a thinner string, and vice versa. Thinner strings typically offer higher performance but break more frequently than thicker strings.
Stringing pattern.
Virtually all modern raquets are strung in a criss-cross horizontal-vertical pattern. Various other patterns have been used in history with varying success.
Double strung tennis racquets were introduced in 1977 but the "spaghetti racquets" were later banned because they permitted excessive spin and were too successful. However, a modern version of the double strung racquet has been introduced that is legal to use.
Racquets are strung either with two separate strings (and thus four knots), or with a single string (resulting in only two knots). Sometimes, a hybrid of two different string types may be used in the same racquet. Traditionally, a double half hitch has been used to tie off tennis string, along with a starting knot. Recently, a new kind of knot has been used called the "pro-knot" or "Richard Parnell knot". Along with the use of a starting clamp, this can make all the knots identical, and improve the aesthetics of a string job.
Stringing.
The process of installing strings in the racquet is called "stringing," and is done with a racquet string machine. These machines vary in complexity, accuracy and price.
String Tension.
The "string tension" of a racquet, usually expressed in pounds, indicates the pressure under which the strings are secured to the frame. The string tension affects a racquet's playing characteristics, such as the "feel" of the ball, control over the ball, as well as maximizing power.
All racquets come with recommended string tensions, most of which lie between 50 to 70 pounds (220 to 310 N).
A loosely strung racquet will usually have a larger sweet spot and will hit farther but, when swung hard enough, it will shoot balls unpredictably; a tighter string job will help make delicate shots with more finesse and control.
An extremely tightly strung racquet cuts down on a tennis player's feel on the ball, but can give the player excellent control if swung hard enough, with a smooth stroke. Such tension may make delicate shots more difficult, but makes play from the baseline more constant. However, if a player often hits powerful shots, a tightly strung racquet may quickly tire the arm, possibly resulting in tennis elbow.
Many professional stringers advise players to string racquets with the lowest tension possible while still being able to maintain control of the ball. Beginning players trying to find their tension should start in the middle of the recommended tension range and adjust the tension from there to meet their needs. The recommended tension is usually printed on the racquet. With a lower tension the racquet will have more power and less control; with a higher tension, it will have less power and more control.
Restringing.
Due to the tension present on the strings, elasticity and tension begins to decrease the moment they are installed in a racquet. "Dead strings", or strings which have lost their tension, cut down on the performance of a racquet. Dead strings may also hamper a tennis player's ability to generate power and pace, and may even make their arm sore.
The frequency of restringing depends on the player and the racquet, but there are a few recommended intervals. One is to restring the racquet as many times in a year as the player uses it in a week; e.g., if the racquet is used three times per week, it should be restrung three times per year. Another guideline is to restring after every 40 hours of play; if the racquet is used three times per week and three hours per session, it should be restrung approximately every five weeks. If the player has access to a tennis string tension meter (or access to a pro shop equipped with one), he may restring his racquet after he measures a loss of 25% or more of stringbed stiffness. However, many players who hit the ball hard to break the strings simply restring rackets whenever the strings break.
United States Racquet Stringers Association.
The United States Racquet Stringers Association (USRSA) offers two levels of certification for stringers: the Certified Stringer and the Master Racquet Technician, of which around 350 exist worldwide. The Master Racquet Technician certification process includes testing of the stringer's ability to string a racquet, perform grip work, identify mistakes in an improperly strung racquet, and pass a written test that covers not only strings, but racquet technology as well.
Since 2004, "RSi," the USRSA's monthly magazine, has named a Stringer of the Year. Past winners were:

Dick Hantak

Dick Hantak (born c. 1938) was an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) for 25 years between 1978 and 2003. He began his NFL officiating career as a back judge and became a referee eight years later. During his career, he officiated in two Super Bowls, Super Bowl XVII in 1983 as a back judge and later as a referee in Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, both at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and selected as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXII in 1998. He was one of the first officials to wear a three-digit uniform number, wearing number 105 except for 1979-81, when officials were numbered separately by position.
Hantak was most notable for being involved in a game that would result in the elimination of the excessive crowd noise rule from the NFL because of the actions during an exhibition game preceding the 1989 NFL season between the Cincinnati Bengals and New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome. Prior to the snap to begin a play, Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason constantly complained to Hantak about the loud crowd noise inside of the dome and would embellish his reactions in protest over the newly created rule. Esiason would later admit that he was put up to the task by then head coach Sam Wyche.
Hantak was also involved in a humorous incident during a 1996 game between Pittsburgh and Carolina. On a punt the ball landed in the endzone and the Carolina mascot Sir Purr downed it, unaware the ball was live. While Steelers coach Bill Cowher was laughing, Hantak told Sir Purr not to do it again. 
Dick ended his distinguished officiating career with a on January 11, 2003 between the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets.
As of the 2006 NFL season, Hantak serves as an NFL replay official, working on-site in the video officiating booth.
Hantak is a 1960 graduate of Southeast Missouri State University and was a member of Sigma Tau Gamma.

York Museum Gardens

The York Museum Gardens are botanic gardens in the centre of York, England, beside the River Ouse. They cover an area of of the former grounds of St Mary's Abbey, and were created in the 1830s by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society along with the Yorkshire Museum which they contain.
The gardens are held in trust by the City of York Council and are managed by the York Museums Trust. They were designed in a gardenesque style by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith, and contain a variety of species of plants, trees and birds. Admission is free. A variety of events take place in the gardens, such as open-air theatre performances and festival activities.
There are several historic buildings in the gardens. They contain the remains of the west corner of the Roman fort of Eboracum, including the Multangular Tower and parts of the Roman walls. In the same area there is also the Anglian Tower, which was probably built into the remains of a late Roman period fortress. During the Middle Ages, the tower was expanded and the Roman walls were incorporated into York's city walls. Most of the other buildings dating from the Middle Ages are associated with St Mary's Abbey, including the ruins of the abbey church, the Hospitium, the lodge and part of the surviving precinct wall. The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th century, including the Yorkshire Museum and its octagonal observatory. The museum houses four permanent collections, covering biology, geology, archaeology and astronomy.
History.
The gardens, which were given to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society by the British Royal Family in 1828, occupy part of the former grounds of St. Mary’s Abbey. The society acquired the land to build a museum to house its collections; the Yorkshire Museum was completed in 1830. The land was granted to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society under the condition that botanical gardens would be established on the site. These were created during the 1830s in a gardenesque style design by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith. They originally contained a conservatory, a pond and a menagerie, which was destroyed when a bear escaped from it and had brief control of the area. The then Princess Victoria visited the gardens in 1835, the year that they were first open to the public. In 1854 the gardens were described as "one of the principal attractions of York". At this time entrance as free to members and for non-members entrance cost one shilling except on Saturday when it cost six pence.
In 1960, the gardens and the Yorkshire Museum were given in trust to the City of York Council and they became a public park. Since 2002, they have been managed by the York Museums Trust, along with York Castle Museum and York Art Gallery. The gardens are maintained by the Askham Bryan College of Agriculture.
Description.
York Museum Gardens cover an area of on the north bank of the River Ouse, just outside the city walls in the centre of York. There are four entrances to the gardens: on Marygate (off Bootham) by St Olave's Church, on Museum Street by Lendal Bridge, via a path at the side of King's Manor, and from the riverside walk next to the River Ouse. The site slopes gently down towards the river and is made up of historical buildings and undulating lawns interspersed with plants and trees. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours, so the opening and closing times vary throughout the year. Normally admission is free but there are charges for some events. In 2010 it was estimated that the gardens attract 1.3 million visitors a year. Drinking alcohol, cycling and ball games are not allowed in the gardens.
The gardens are home to a population of semi-tame grey squirrels and many species of birds. Until 2006 a family of peacocks had been in residence for at least 70 years. There are approximately 4,500 plants and trees in the collection, some of the varieties native to England and some from other parts of the world. Planting consists of large beds containing predominantly shrubs and trees, and lawns interspersed with individual trees. Species of tree include a monkey puzzle tree along with oak and chestnut trees; three of the trees in the gardens are classed as United Kingdom champion trees. There is a rockery next to the Marygate entrance, by the ruins of the abbey church, and in front of the entrance to the Yorkshire Museum there is a terrace bordered with beds of white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire.
There is also a geological oddity close to the main gates, consisting of a large boulder of pink granite that was discovered during construction of the city's railway station. Since this type of stone is not local it was determined as having been transported there from Shap in Cumbria by glacial action during the last ice age.
Activities.
As well as being a popular recreational space for both residents and visitors, the gardens are the venue for special events such as open-air theatre and music performances. In 1970, bands including Roxy Music, Hawkwind and Pink Fairies staged concerts, and in 2007 The Lord Chamberlain's Men presented a production of "Romeo & Juliet". During the 20th-century revival of the York Mystery Plays, performances were held on a fixed stage in the gardens among the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey. In the 1950s, York actress Dame Judi Dench acted in the plays performed in the gardens, and played the Virgin Mary in 1957. 2012 sees the York Mystery Plays return to the gardens between 2-27 August and will involve over one thousand local volunteers. Several of York's festivals use the gardens as a venue for events; in 2006, between 800 and 1,000 people celebrated the Chinese New Year with displays that included lion dancers, and in 2007 during the Jorvik Viking festival there were demonstrations of Viking craft skills and battle training. The gardens are the location of York’s Saluting Station, one of only 12 in the United Kingdom, with 21-gun salutes being fired at noon to celebrate occasions related to the British Royal Family throughout the year. At these times a military band marches to the gardens before the salute is fired.
Buildings.
Roman.
In the northeast of Museum Gardens there are remains of the west corner of the fortifications that surrounded the Roman fort of Eboracum. The original defences, consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74 AD. Later those were replaced by a clay mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers. These stone defences are some of the few Roman remains that are visible above ground in York.
The Multangular Tower is the western corner tower of the Roman fortress, and consists of both Roman and medieval architecture. The tower has 10 sides, from which it derives its modern name ""multangular"", and is 19 feet (5.8 m) high. It was built in its late Roman form during the early 4th century, when it was constructed with three floors to house a catapult. Five Roman stone coffins are in the Multangular Tower, which were brought from graveyards in other areas of York.
A 76 foot (23 m) section of 4th-century wall connects the Multangular Tower to a small interval tower. The side of the wall and towers facing into Museum Gardens is carefully faced in stone, as during the Roman period it was on display. The other side is rougher because it was originally covered by an earth bank. The wall and towers were still in use after the end of the Roman period in Britain, and were subsequently incorporated into the medieval city walls. As late as the English Civil War they were being used to defend the city, and there is a hole in the wall along from the Multangular Tower that was made by a cannon ball during this period. The Roman parts of the wall and towers are constructed of regular rectangular limestone blocks with a band of red tile running through them. The later medieval additions can be identified by the use of much larger blocks of limestone that cut through the red tiles in places and by the cross shaped arrow slits on the Multangular Tower.
To the north of the Multangular Tower there is a stretch of the medieval city wall with the remains of the original Roman wall running parallel to it on the city side. Built into this part of the wall is the stone Anglian Tower, which was once thought to have been built during the reign of Edwin of Northumbria, but now is generally thought to be of the very late Roman period. Behind the Anglian Tower are a series of banks showing the level of the defences during the Roman, early Middle Ages, Norman, and late medieval periods.
Medieval.
The gardens contain several buildings dating back to the medieval period, most of them relating to St Mary's Abbey. The Benedictine Abbey's origins date back to 1086 when Alan Count of Brittany granted St Olave's Church and the adjoining land to the monk Stephen of Whitby, who became the first abbot of St. Mary's. When St Olave's Church became too small, a larger church in a Romanesque style was built nearby, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1089 by William II. This was replaced between 1270 and 1279 by a church in a Gothic style. The abbey became the wealthiest monastery in the North of England, worth over £2,085 a year before it was dissolved by Henry VIII on 25 November 1539. Over the next 200 years the abbey fell into disrepair and the abbey church was largely dismantled for its stone.
Stones from the abbey church can be seen lining paths throughout the gardens, but the major ruins of the church are on the western side. The church was aligned on a northeast axis because of the shape and size of the site, instead of pointing to the east, the normal alignment for churches in England. Part of the north and west walls that formed the nave and crossing, designed in Gothic style by architect Simon of Pabenham in the 13th century, remain standing. The ruins include dummy lancet windows, tracery windows and "tracery remains to show that the patterns alternated between a single large circle over two lights and three small circles over three lights". The column capitals are decorated with foliage in a stiff-leaf style as well as in a naturalistic style, although this stonework is weatherworn and so this decoration is hard to distinguish. Sections of the foundations of the church and its Norman predecessor are exposed, and a plan of their layouts can be seen in the grass. Finds excavated from the site, including life-sized statues of Christian saints, can be seen in the Yorkshire Museum.
St Mary's Lodge was built around 1470 as an addition to the late 12th-century buildings that formed the gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey, – now the Marygate entrance to the gardens. Some remains of the 12th-century gatehouse can still be seen, in particular the archway attached to the side of the lodge. The lodge is built of stone, and does not contain timber framing like the nearby Hospitium. The lodge, along with the attached railings, gates and gate piers are all Grade I listed buildings, which means that they are of outstanding interest. Originally, the lodge may have been used as a guesthouse for the abbey, and was the point where the poor could claim alms from the abbey. After the abbey's dissolution, the lodge became a courthouse until 1722, when part of the building became the Brown Cow pub. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's curator, restored and converted it to use as his home while retaining its external appearance. The lodge subsequently became used as offices, and during the early 21st century became the headquarters of the York Museums Trust.
Along with the lodge, some of the abbey's precinct walls are still standing. A section of the remaining walls runs along the north-west part of the gardens and extends further along Marygate to Bootham. The walls were constructed in 1266 and increased in height and crenellated in 1318 under a royal license from Edward III. Originally there was a defensive ditch along the outside of the walls. The walls include several towers, not all of them dating from the medieval period; the semicircular tower near the gatehouse is a 19th-century reconstruction. The walls and towers were used for the abbey's defence, e.g. in disputes with the City of York over land ownership and taxes, and played a role in the defence of the city during the Siege of York.
The Hospitium is located between the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and is thought to have originally been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally part of a group of buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a passage that ran towards the water-gate by the river.
The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens, by the Museum Street entrance. The hospital was the largest in England during the Middle Ages, and was run by a community of men and women of the Augustinian order. During the 14th century, the hospital could have contained as many as 240 patients, 18 clergy and 30 choristers. St. Leonard's Hospital was closed during the dissolution of the monasteries, when it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Magnus. The undercroft and chapel were part of the infirmary built between 1225 and 1250. The interior of the undercroft, accessible from the gardens, has a rib vaulted ceiling and houses a collection of Roman and medieval stonework. In 1999, the hospital and surrounding area in Museum Gardens was one of three sites in York to feature in an edition of the British Channel 4 television show "Time Team".
Between the Museum Street entrance to the gardens and the River Ouse is a short stretch of York's city walls, which ends at the medieval Lendal Tower.
19th and 20th century.
William Hincks was instrumental in establishing the gardens. Henry John Wilkinson reports as follows:
"Mr. Hincks was lecturer on botany at the York School of Medicine, and the services he rendered to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for over ten years deserve our grateful thanks. He devoted his leisure time to convert the " waste land " into a botanical and ornamental* garden, and in this work he was ably assisted by the late sub-curator, Henry Baines. " 
The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Yorkshire Museum, one of the first purpose-built museums in Britain. The Yorkshire Museum was designed by architect William Wilkins in a Greek Revival style and was officially opened in February 1830. On 26 September 1831 the inaugural meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the Yorkshire Museum. Three of the museum's permanent collections are housed in the Yorkshire Museum building all of which have English designated collection status, which means they are "pre-eminent collections of national and international importance". The biology collection contains 200,000 specimens, including both fauna and flora, with most of the collection made up of insects. There are two stuffed specimens of the extinct great auk, an almost complete skeleton of an extinct moa and a large collection of specimens from the Yorkshire region including the remains of elephants, cave bears and hyena from Kirkdale Cave dated to the Quaternary period, around 125,000 years ago. The geological collection contains over 112,500 specimens of rocks, minerals and fossils. Fossils make up most of the collection numbering over 100,000 samples, and include important specimens from the Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Tertiary periods. The archaeology collection has close to a million objects that date from around 500,000 BC to the 20th century, including the Coppergate Helmet discovered in York in 1982, and the Ormside Bowl, an intricate example of an Anglian silversmith.
Most of the museum's astronomy collection is housed in the octagonal observatory in the centre of the gardens, built during 1832 and 1833. The design of its rotating roof is credited to John Smeaton designer of the Eddystone Lighthouse. A telescope built in 1850 by the instrument maker Thomas Cooke of York was installed during the observatory's 1981 restoration. It is Yorkshire's oldest working observatory and as of August 2007 was opened to the public by a team of volunteers. The building is currently opened every Thursday and Saturday 11.30 until 2.30. The clock in the observatory was made by Barraud of London in 1811, and during the 19th century it was used to set the time for other clocks in York.
At the eastern, Museum Street, entrance to the gardens is Museum Gardens' Lodge built in 1874 to a design by George Fowler Jones in a Victorian Gothic revival style. The lodge now houses the Yorkshire Philosophical Society's offices and reading room.
The curator's house, built in 1844 and originally called the keeper's house, is located by King's Manor. It was designed by J B Atkinson and was built using reclaimed limestone from St. Mary's Abbey.
Tempest Anderson Hall.
The Tempest Anderson Hall is a 300-seat auditorium-style lecture theatre built in 1912 as an annexe to the Yorkshire Museum. Dr Tempest Anderson, a York surgeon and vulcanologist, presented the hall to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society to replace its existing lecture theatre. Designed by E Ridsdale Tate, it is an early example of the use of reinforced concrete and is a Grade I listed building. In the late 20th century it housed a cinema, but it is now used as a conference venue and lecture theatre.

Glasgow University Magazine

The Glasgow University Magazine (GUM) was first published on 5 February 1889, aiming to keep students informed of news and events within the University, and to provide an outlet for student writing and illustrations.
It is the oldest continuously published student magazine in Scotland and despite changes in style has continued to document the University's history from the student's point of view, with reports of sporting achievements and debates, short stories and poems, articles and letters giving opinions on the political and moral issues of the day, and photographs of office bearers and medal winners.
GUM provided a start for a number of illustrators, writers and editors who went on to make their marks in the wider world. They included James Bridie, Charles Oakley, and John Buchan, the author of The Thirty-Nine Steps, who wrote for GUM in the 1890s.
GUM is a part of and is partially funded by Glasgow University Students' Representative Council, although it retains editorial independence. It is one of four student media organisations within the SRC, who provide both a service and opportunities to students at the University and to the local community.
The Magazine won three awards in The Herald Scottish Student Press Awards 2006: Best Production, Best Magazine and Student Journalist of the Year for Jenny Munro's fashion writing.
The Magazine also won the award for Best Magazine at the 2008 Herald Scottish Student Press Awards.

Guelta d'Archei

The Guelta d'Archei is probably the most famous guelta in the Sahara. It is located in the Ennedi Plateau, in north-eastern Chad, south-east of the town of Fada. The Guelta d'Archei is inhabited by several kinds of animals, most notably the Nile crocodile ("Crocodylus niloticus" Laurenti). Middle Holocene remains, as well as rock paintings, indicate that this species once thrived across most of today's Sahara Desert and in swamps and rivers along South Mediterranean shores. The small group of surviving crocodiles in the Guelta d'Archei represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today; the Tagant Plateau colony in Mauritania has likely been extinct since 1996.
The Guelta d'Archei is a barren place, away from beaten paths; reaching it requires a 4x4 and at least four days' travel from n'Djamena, Chad's capital. The place depicted in the picture can only be reached by a few hours' trek from the nearest point a 4x4 can approach.

<doc id="5977959" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5977959" title="Chuōjiǎo">
Chuōjiǎo

Chuōjiǎo () is a Chinese martial art that comprises many jumps, kicks, and fast fist sequences. The fist and feet work in unison and strike continuously forward, like “falling meteorites”, never giving the opponent a moment to recover. The qinggong portion of this style's training involves a practitioner jumping against a wall with heavy weights affixed to his/her calves. This style is practiced mainly in central Hebei, northern China, Beijing and Liaoning in North-eastern China.
History.
"Chuōjiǎo" originated in the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) and became popular during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368–1911). The source from Wu Binlou, a famous Chuojiao expert and founder of Beijing style, believed "Chuōjiǎo" comes from the Wen Family Boxing style of the Song dynasty (960–1279).
"Chuōjiǎo" is attributed to Deng Liang, who is said to have created the style on the basis of the 18 basic feet plays. He developed the basics according to calculations of the Chinese abacus to form a chain of feet plays incorporating 108 tricks. According to legend, he later taught the monk Zhou Tong the style, who later passed it on to his pupil General Yue Fei.
Some of the outlaws who appear in the famous novel "The Water Margin", such as Wu Song, were experts in this style; this is why Chuojiaoquan was alternately known as the "Water Margin Outlaw style". It is also known as "Yuānyāng Tuǐ" (鴛鴦腿) or "Mandarin Duck Leg." In "The Water Margin"'s 28th chapter, entitled "Drunken Wu Song beats Jiang Menshen innkeeper", it mentions that Wu Song uses the following moves: "step of nephrite ring, leg of mandarin duck".
Feng Keshen (冯克善), a general in the failed Taiping Rebellion of the early 19th century, was a "Chuōjiǎo" "Fānziquán" master. After the failure of the rebellion, Feng went into seclusion with two other experts Tang Youyi in Hebei Province in Raoyang, where he taught "Fānziquán", which emphasizes the hands, to the Wang family and "Chuōjiǎo", which emphasizes the feet, to the Duan family. During practice, the families would exchange techniques.
Styles.
After Master Zhao Canyi (赵灿益), Chuojiao has evolved into many branches such as those below:
Liu Family Chuojiao:Was spread throughout Li County, so much so that a large proportion of the county can practice some aspects of Chuojiao even until today. Liu Guanlan taught third generation Guo Gexi, Liu Songlin, Liu Zhenguo, Li Gepu and Liu Zhenjiang. Liu Family Chuojiao is representative of Lixian Chuojiao or Hebei Chuojiao. Current Representatives include Zhang Shuanglong, Wang Zhiyi, Zhang Xiaowang, Liu Zhenmin, Liu Xuehui and Cui Linsheng.
Duan Family Chuojiao: The Duan brothers taught in Raoyang the following third generation: Liu Laowang, Li Timing, Jia Laokai, Zhang Laoxiao, and others. This style is typically known as Raoyang Chuojiao. Current representatives of Raoyang Chuojiao include Li Jiantao, Song Qingbo, Ma Yongchao, Li Juncai, Li Zhenguo and Li Jiankuan.
Wang Family Chuojiao: Wang Zhanao who studied with his father Wang Zhiguo and Zhao Canyi, taught Zhang Jingtian, Wang Zhongli who then taught others. Additionally he taught Xu Zhaoxiong who then took the style to Dongbei.
Zhao Family Chuojiao: Zhao Yiguan taught in the Gaoyang and Baoding areas including Zhao Zhenben, Zhao Laoxian, Chen Yuanhu, Zhou Yuxiang and others. Noting that this style had consolidated influences in earlier generations via Wang Zhiguo and in latter generations from Raoyang (Li Timing) and Lixian (Liu Zhenjiang). This style was commonly referred to as Gaoyang Chuojiao. Some of the Current representatives of Zhao Family Chuojiao include Zhao Haowei and Wu Chanlong (Nephy Perez)
Wei Family Chuojiao: Wei Changyi taught many including the sharing with Xingyi practitioners, but his main disciple was Wei Zankui who in turn taught the famous Beijing Chuojiaofanzi Wu Binlou. Additionally Wei Laofang taught Chuojiao in Li county and his disciples spread the art in Zhangjiakou and western regions of China such as Gansu province. Some branches are also known as Lixian Chuojiao. Some of the current representatives of Beijing ChuojiaoFanzi include Hong Zhitian and Liu Xuebo. Current Representative of the Wei Laofang school includes Sun Deyu and Kang Yiwu. see www.halifaxwushu.com for more information on this branch
Yin Family Chuojiao: Yin Chun Zhang taught his son Yin Ruyan, who in turn taught Yin Xuelang. Yin xuelang had held the skills within the family until late 20th century when he taught Liu Renyi and Zhang Hong, the current masters and propagators of this family’s Chuojiao. This style is also referred to as "Gu Zhizi".
Later branches derived from the original ones above include:
Zhang Family Chuojiao: Zhang Jing Tian, was a disciple of Master Wang Zhi Guo. He passed his skills to Zhang Heng Qing, nicknamed “Iron Leg Zhang Heng Qing” taught Chuojiao in Yangzhou to Wang Qing Fu, He Yu Shan, Tian Chun and others
Gao Family Chuojiao: In Shenyang a master from Li county by the name of Gao Bai Quan passed on a Chuo jiao style named “Di Gong Chuo Jiao” (Ground Skill Chuo Jiao). Master Gao was born in Li county and commenced the pracitce of Chuo Jiao at the age of 11 under master Wang Yong Cen (a disciple of Wei Lao Fang who studied with Zhao Can Yi).
Xu Family Chuojiao: Xu Zhaoxiong, was a student of Wang Zhanao (Son of Wang Zhiguo and disciple of Zhao Canyi). Master Xu brought his Chuojiao and propagated the art in Dongbei areas (Liaoning etc.). This is also known as Dongbei Chuojiao.
Hu Family Chuojiao: Hu Feng San, nicknamed “Hua Qiang Hu” (Flower Spear Hu) for his command of the spear, was a master of other martial arts (Shaolin, Xingyi etc.) prior to studying with the Duan brothers in Raoyang. He taught sequences of Wen Tang Zi (Scholarly Sequences) to students in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning Province, that he was said to have created after studying with the Duan brothers in Rao Yang. It is said that he mastered great Duan family’s short kicks. This is also known as Dongbei Chuojiao.
Techniques.
The martial routine was the origin of Chuojiao (poking feet boxing). The martial routine in Shenyang later became known as the Hao-style Chuojiao, namely feet poking boxing named after Hao Mingjiu. It features powerful but comfortable moves and its blows are accurate and incorporate a variety of subtle feet tricks. Hands and feet cooperate well for better advantage and longer reach. Its strikes are short but fatal. Hardness is the core of Chuojiao which it combines with suppleness. Its routine consists of nine inter-connected twin feet routines. These routines can be practised either one by one, or linked together. The feet plays call for close cooperation between the feet which is why it is called twin feet play. Another feet poking Chuan is called nine-tumble 18-fall Chuan.
The scholarly routine is a derivative of the martial routine. It is said that during the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1875–1908) of the Qing Dynasty, boxer Hu Fengsan of Shenyang learned of the fame of Chuojiao masters, the Duans in Hebei Province, and traveled 500 kilometers to study with him. After years of hard work, Hu came to understand the secrets of Chuojiao and went back to his native town, where he further developed the art into the scholarly routine, known later as the Hu-style Chuojiao. It is characterized by its exquisite and compact stances and clear-cut, accurate and varied movements. It is also very fast in delivering both fist and feet blows. The scholarly style features such routines as 12-move Chuan, 18-move Chuan, flying swallow Chuan (small flying swallow Chuan), arm Chuan, turning-ring Chuan, jade-ring Chuan, six-method Chuan, two-eight Chuan, two-eight feet plays, 16-move Chuan, 24-move Chuan, 32-move Chuan, soft tumbling Chuan, one-legged 80-move feet plays, one-handed 81-move fist plays, etc.
The martial-scholar tumbling Chuan has combined the strengths of the martial and scholar routines, especially the combative techniques. It is arranged according to the rhythms of offence and defence of the martial arts and combines high-low, release-catch, extension-flexion and straight-rounded movements. Its tricks, combinations of motions, still exercises, hardness, suppleness, substantial and insubstantial moves are well planned and accurate. New tricks include ground skill feet poking, feet poking tumbles, Shaolin feet poking, leg flicking feet poking, free-mind feet poking, eight-diagram feet poking, etc. All these have their own styles, forms, rhythms and techniques.

Muhammed V of Granada

Muhammed V (4 January 1338 – 16 January 1391) was the eighth Nasrid ruler of the Moorish Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus on the Iberian Peninsula.
Muhammad V was the eldest son and heir of Yusuf I by his slave Butayna, born on Sunday, January 4, 1338. He also had a younger full-blood sister, A'isha, two half brothers and five half-sisters. He ruled between 1354–1359 and 1362–1391, and is best known for completing the royal palace of the Alhambra with the Palace of the Lions and the Mexuar, or "Cuarto Dorado".
Sultan.
He inherited the throne from Yusuf I but was overthrown in August 1359 by his half-brother Ismail II and sought protection with the Marinid sultan of Fez, where Muhammed was inspired with fresh examples of architecture. Ismail was overthrown and murdered with his brother Qays less than a year later in 1360, by his brother-in-law, Abu Said, who ruled as Muhammed VI but was overthrown in turn by Muhammed V, who returned to the throne for another 29 years.
During the three-year period of the reign of Muhammed VI, Muhammed V was plotting his return to power. A chance came in 1362 when King Peter I of Castile (Pedro el Cruel) lured Muhammed VI to his kingdom. There, in Seville, he was murdered and his head sent to Muhammed V as a gift upon his return to the throne. As a gesture of good relations between him and the Marinid, the eldest son of Muhammed V, Yusuf II, married to a daughter of the Marinid Sultan. His hospital in Granada was completed in 1366. He employed the poet and diplomat Ibn Khaldun in negotiations with Pedro the Cruel.
Death.
Muhammed V died on January 16, 1391. He had at least four sons; Yusuf II, Nasr, Muhammad and Sa'd. He was succeeded by his son, Yusuf II.

Most of the way is easy walking across pleasant meadows and through woodlands, mostly in the county borough of Wrexham in Wales, but partly in Cheshire and Shropshire in England.
Many parts of the walk follow waterways: Grindley Brook, the Llangollen Canal, the River Dee, and the river Ceiriog in the Ceiriog Valley.
The way also passes through towns and villages: Overton-on-Dee with its ancient yew trees, one of the Seven Wonders of Wales; Penley, where the wartime Polish Army Hospital once boosted the population threefold, Hanmer, situated on the peaceful mere which gave the village and its local aristocracy, the Hanmer family, their name, Chirk featuring Chirk Castle and Thomas Telfords Chirk Aqueduct.

The Man I Love (song)

"The Man I Love" is a popular standard, with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by his brother Ira. Originally part of the 1924 score for the Gershwin government satire "Lady, Be Good" as "The Girl I Love", the song was deleted from the show as well as from both the 1927 anti-war satire "Strike Up the Band" (where it first appeared as "The Man I Love") and 1928 Ziegfeld hit "Rosalie" after tryouts. It is the basis for the 1947 film "The Man I Love" starring Ida Lupino and Bruce Bennett and featured prominently throughout.
As with many standards of the era, it has become more famous as an independent popular song than as one from a Broadway musical.

Anat-her

Anat-her was a hyksos ruler of the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt around 1600 BCE during what is often referred to as the Second Intermediate Period.
Anather's name has not been found represented within a cartouche and there is no evidence, therefore, that he reigned as pharaoh. He may have instead been a prince under the authority of the 15th dynasty at Avaris.
This ruler is only attested by a steatite scarab possibly from Bubastis. His name means "Anat is content" and refers to the Semitic goddess which affirms his non-Egyptian heritage. It is accompanied by the title "Heka-chasut" meaning "ruler of the foreign countries"; perhaps a reference to the slice of territory under his control.

Paul Brousse

Paul Brousse (January 23, 1844April 1, 1912) was a French socialist, leader of the "possibilistes" group. He was active in the Jura Federation, a section of the International Working Men's Association (IWMA), from the northwestern part of Switzerland and the Alsace. He helped edit the "Bulletin de la Fédération Jurassienne", along with anarchist Peter Kropotkin. He was in contact with Gustave Brocher between 1877 and 1880, who became anarchist under Brousse's influence. Paul Brousse edited two newspapers, one in French and another in German. He helped James Guillaume publish its bulletin.
Paul Brousse studied medicine and travelled to Barcelona in his youth. He then joined the IWMA and participated to the Geneva Congress in September 1873, seeing anarchism as the only possible social organization. On March 18, 1877, he took part in Bern in a demonstration in remembrance of the 1871 Paris Commune, which ended in riots with the police. Paul Brousse was subsequently condemned to one month of prison. On April 15, 1879, he is again sentenced to two months of prison, and then expulsed from Switzerland, for having published an article in "L'Avant-Garde" which legitimized the propaganda of the deed attempts of Giovanni Passannante, Juan Oliva Moncasi, Max Hödel and Karl Nobiling. Paul Brousse then returned to France in 1880 and progressively became more reformist. He began to take part in the French Workers' Party (POF) and then, after a scission, to the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (FTSF), which became known as the "possibilists". He voted at the August 1886 international congress in London along with Jules Guesde for the expulsion of the "anti-authoritarian socialists", as were known the anarchists. The possibilists then joined Jean Jaurès's French Socialist Party in 1902, which fused with others movements in 1905 to create the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).

2006 Hungarian Grand Prix

The 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on August 6, 2006 at the Hungaroring, Budapest. It was the 13th race of the 2006 Formula One season. Jenson Button won the race, the first victory of his career and the first race win for a British driver since David Coulthard won the Australian Grand Prix three years previously, and the first by an Englishman since Johnny Herbert won the 1999 European Grand Prix nearly seven years previously, in similarly changeable weather circumstances. Pedro de la Rosa finished second for McLaren, the first podium finish of his career, and Nick Heidfeld finished third, giving BMW Sauber their first ever podium.
Report.
Background.
The weekend before the grand prix, British motoring show host Jeremy Clarkson told Jenson Button that if he was going to win a race, he would need a better windscreen. It is not known whether the windscreen was actually changed. During Friday practice Fernando Alonso was given a two-second qualifying penalty by the stewards for dangerous driving and overtaking under a yellow flag condition. This meant that two seconds would be added to his times in each part of qualifying. Christijan Albers was given a ten-place grid penalty for an engine change, his second in as many weekends. Jenson Button received the same penalty after having an engine change when his let go in the final practice session.
In a similar situation to Alonso's penalty, Michael Schumacher was given a two-second penalty for overtaking Robert Kubica and Alonso under "red flag" conditions at the end of Saturday's last free practice session. The decision left Schumacher "fuming," with him saying "I blame myself partly for what did happen, but I didn't expect this kind of penalty."
Qualifying.
In qualifying, Kimi Räikkönen achieved pole position with a time of 1:19.599 seconds. Felipe Massa qualified second, with Rubens Barrichello starting the race in third.
Race.
The track was wet at the start of the race, making it the first ever wet Hungarian Grand Prix. Polesitter Kimi Räikkönen took the lead early on. Alonso and Schumacher made their way through the field with Schumacher up into 6th place from 11th into the first corner, and Alonso climbing from 15th place with a spectacular first hardfought lap. He went on to pass Schumacher on the outside of turn 5 after a straight fight for several laps and reached 3rd place. He then took the lead after the McLarens of Pedro de la Rosa and Räikkönen pitted. Bridgestone wet-tyres used to dictate the field in non-dry conditions but today it seemed a one-off for the Japanese rubber. All Bridgestone-drivers, including the Ferraris, were seen struggling and seriously down on pace compared to their competitors. Schumacher fell right back in the clutches of Giancarlo Fisichella and lost his front wing battling for 5th place, hitting the Italian mid-corner fighting off snap-oversteer. This forced the German to pit, going a lap down. Soon after Jenson Button overtook Massa, Fisichella and Schumacher in just under the space of 2 laps. Räikkönen struggled on his second set of tyres and ended up crashing into the back of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso, vaulting the car and bringing out the safety car. Alonso then pitted, allowing Schumacher to get back on the lead lap. Another beneficiary of the safety car was Jenson Button, who decided not to pit during the safety car period and climbed up to 2nd place behind Alonso. After the period was over Button began to challenge Alonso, but soon had to pit for fuel. Alonso led, but after a pitstop for dry tyres his right-rear wheel nut detached, causing the Spaniard to lose control and crash. Button inherited the lead and was never challenged from then on. Schumacher made his way up to 2nd by staying on intermediate tyres as others around him pitted for dry weather ones, but this gamble backfired as the cars on drys caught him in the final laps. Schumacher defended his position (including controversially cutting a chicane on consecutive laps without penalty), but Pedro de la Rosa and Nick Heidfeld both ultimately passed him. Whilst he was being overtaken Schumacher banged wheels with Heidfeld, damaging his Ferrari's suspension and forcing him out of the race with two laps to go. 
Button won the race despite beginning in 14th place through relentless driving with de la Rosa scoring his first podium with second place, and Heidfeld getting BMW Sauber's first ever podium with 3rd. Debutant driver Robert Kubica finished in seventh place and scored two points, but was later disqualified as his car was underweight due to excessive tire wear. This coincidentally meant that Michael Schumacher earned a point despite not finishing, as he was elevated to 8th place in the final results.

<doc id="5978127" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5978127" title="Thousandth of an inch">
Thousandth of an inch

A thousandth of an inch is a derived unit of length in the imperial system of units. Equal to 0.001 inches, it is normally referred to as a thou , a thousandth, or (particularly in the United States) a mil.
The plural of "thou" is also "thou" (thus one hundredth of an inch is "10 thou"), while the plural of "mil" is "mils" (thus "10 mils"). Both words come from roots meaning "1000": "thou" from the English "thousand", which is from the Germanic root for 1000, and "mil" from the Romance root for 1000. The imperial "mil" can occasionally be confused with the millimetre which is sometimes shortened to "mill" or "mills" (plural), especially in spoken dimensions or with those who are not familiar with the term. One mil is considerably smaller than a millimetre at ~0.0254mm or ~25.40μm.
Contexts of use.
The thou, or mil, is most commonly used in engineering and manufacturing. For example in specifying:
There are also compound units such as "mils per year" used to express corrosion rates.
A related measurement for area known as the circular mil, is based on a circle having a diameter of one mil.
"Tenths".
In machining, where the thou is often treated as a basic unit, 0.0001 inches can be referred to as "one tenth", meaning "one tenth of a thou". (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining "to within a few tenths" is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in plug gauge and gauge block manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used.
Usage notes on "mil" versus "thou".
The unit is generally referred to as a "thou" outside of the United States; within the U.S., "mil" was once the more common term, although as use of the metric system has become common within U.S. industry in recent decades, "thou" has begun to replace "mil" among some technical users to , and today both terms are used, but in specific contexts one is traditionally preferred over the other. Thus "mil" tends to be used more than "thou" for the thickness of plastic sheet, while "thou" or "thousandths" tends to be used when discussing machined dimensions.
"Thou" began as a colloquial abbreviation of "thousandth", and it is not much encountered in older published books, where it was copy-editorially avoided, for the same reason that other colloquialisms were usually purged—that is, from a feeling that their use was somehow indecorous in published writing. (For example, although physicians have commonly said "exam" and "lab" for many decades, traditional copy-editing rules specifying that they always be spelled out as "examination" and "laboratory" have been enforced even up to the present day.) Most engineers and machinists consider such register-proscribing strictures to be unnecessary, which explains why they are not as invariably enforced since the advent of internet publishing.
Equivalence to other units of length.
Unit conversions.
1 thou is exactly equal to:
Mnemonics.
For machinists who need to maintain a continual "horse sense" of relative size, it is useful to have a gut feeling for the following. (Each of these "equivalents" is off by an amount that is negligible for most practical purposes—for example, 2 tenths on a plus-minus-10-thou tolerance. But the point here is horse sense on the fly—quick common-sense mental math to keep oneself oriented when machining and inspecting.)
History of usage.
The introduction of the thousandth of an inch as a sensible base unit in engineering and machining is generally attributed to Joseph Whitworth who wrote: 
Up until this era, workers such as millwrights, boilermakers, and machinists measured only in traditional fractions of an inch, divided as far as 64ths. Each 64th is about 15 thou. Communication about sizes smaller than a 64th of an inch was subjective and hampered by a degree of ineffability—while phrases such as "scant 64th" or "heavy 64th" were used, their communicative ability was limited by subjectivity. Dimensions and geometry "could" be controlled to high accuracy, but this was done by comparative methods: comparison against templates or other gauges, feeling the degree of drag of calipers, or simply repeatably cutting, relying on the positioning consistency of jigs, fixtures, and machine slides. Such work could only be done in craft fashion: on-site, by feel, rather than at a distance working from drawings and written notes. This in turn limited the kinds of process designs that could work, because they limited the degree of separation of concerns that could occur.
The introduction of thou as a base unit for machining work required the dissemination of vernier calipers and screw micrometers throughout the trade, as the unit is too small to be measured with practical repeatability using rules alone (most rule-markings were far too wide to mark a single mil). During the following half century, such measuring instruments went from expensive rarities to widespread, everyday use among machinists. Bringing more metrology into machining increased the separation of concerns to make possible, for example, designing an assembly to the point of an engineering drawing, then having the mating parts made at different firms who did not have any contact with (or even awareness of) each other—yet still knowing with certainty that their products would have the desired fit.

<doc id="5978142" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5978142" title="Procedures of the Supreme Court of Canada">
Procedures of the Supreme Court of Canada

The procedures of the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing cases is established in the "Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada", the Supreme Court Act, and by tradition.
Terms and sittings.
Hearings of the Supreme Court take place exclusively in the Supreme Court building in Ottawa. The Court sits three times a year for three months at a time starting in January, April, and October. Every two weeks that the Court sits is followed by a two week break making for a total of 18 weeks a year of hearings. The Mondays are often reserved for hearing motions regarding ongoing appeals. The remaining days of the week the Court is used for hearings. The Court will hear one or two cases a day beginning at 9:30 a.m.
Quorum of the Court requires five Justices, but most cases are heard by a panel of seven or nine Justices. The Chief Justice presides over each hearing, except when away, in which case the next most senior judge will take over the Chief Justice's role.
Hearings are taped for delayed telecast in both of Canada's official languages and are often aired on CPAC on Saturdays. The court's hearings are open to the public except for certain sensitive cases where a sealing order is enacted. There are three rows of benches reserved for public seating, which are generally taken on a first-come first-serve basis except where it is reserved by counsel or parties in the appeal.
Leave to appeal.
Initially, all civil and criminal cases had the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. An amendment to the "Supreme Court Act" in 1975 required that parties wishing to appeal must apply for "leave to appeal". The only exception is a select type of more serious criminal cases which were said to have leave "as of right", as well as reference questions submitted to the Court by the federal government.
Appeal applications are considered by the justices in groups of three. Only cases which raise questions of national importance are granted. However, the reasons for their decisions are never given.
Hearings.
On the bench, the Chief Justice of Canada, or, in her absence, the senior puisne justice, presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to her right and left by order of seniority of appointment. At sittings of the Court, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament.
Historically, they were addressed as "My Lord/Lady" during sessions of the court, but this style of address was disapproved of by the current Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin, who has directed lawyers to use the simpler "Your Honour" or "Justice."
Each side is given one hour to make their submissions. Where there are multiple claimants or defendants they are required to split the time among them. However, in exceptional circumstances the parties may apply to the Court to have their time extended. Interveners are typically granted ten minutes to make their arguments.
Reasons.
Once the hearing is complete the judges convene in the judge's conference room behind the Court room to discuss this case. They sit at a round table in the room and each judge gives their opinion of the case, starting with the least senior judge. Typically, once the discussion is complete the justices make a tentative decision of the case, and in most cases a decision will be arrived at by the end the day.
This practice was begun by Chief Justice Cartwright in the 1960s and was intended to reduce the amount of separate reasons that the court was generating at the time and to maintain relations among the judges.
Except where the decision is made orally in during the hearing, once a decision has been reached, an official reasons for judgment may not be made public for several months. During this time their decision may be rewritten several times, and there may be a significant amount of continued debate over how the propositions should be articulated and what should be left out. In the more divided cases, there is a possibility that a judge may switch sides and change the outcome of the case.

A. Ernest Fitzgerald

A. Ernest (Ernie) Fitzgerald was a U.S. government employee from 1965 to 2006.
Biography.
Ernie Fitzgerald was a member of the Senior Executive Service, a management systems deputy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. He was responsible for the development of improved management controls generally, specifically including management information control systems, economic cost effectiveness analysis, statistical programs and analysis, cost estimating and analysis, and productivity enhancement and measurement. The latter responsibility includes supervising Air Force performance measurement activities.
Following service in the U.S. Navy, Fitzgerald earned a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering from the University of Alabama. He is a registered professional engineer and has worked on several successful patents, including one issued in his name. He is the author of "The High Priests of Waste" and "The Pentagonists."
Career.
After working for a number of years as an engineer and in management, Fitzgerald was employed by the U.S. Air Force as Deputy for Management Systems in 1965. While employed at the Pentagon Fitzgerald testified to Congress in 1968 and 1969 about the concealed cost overruns and the technical problems of the Lockheed C-5A transport plane. He was accused of revealing classified information and was fired on order of President Richard M. Nixon. He later successfully appealed to the Civil Service Commission to be reinstated. Furthermore, he was involved in several legal cases that were significant in establishing presidential immunity and defining the rights of government employees, including the U.S. Supreme Court case "Nixon v. Fitzgerald".
Department of Defense Whistleblower.
In 1968, Mr. Fitzgerald reported a $2.3 billion cost overrun in the Lockheed C-5 aircraft program. As a congressional witness before the Joint Economic Committee, he rejected the advice of Air Force officials and testified with candor and transparency about billions of dollars in avionics program cost overruns and other technical problems.
In response to Mr. Fitzgerald’s testimony, President Richard M. Nixon directed that he be fired. “It was reported that Nixon told aides to ‘get rid of that son of a bitch.’” In executing the president’s order, Mr. Fitzgerald was ultimately terminated by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird.
Because of his candor and commitment to the truth, Mr. Fitzgerald was a driving force for whistleblower protections. Mr. Fitzgerald continued to fight a four decade long campaign against fraud, waste, and abuse within the Department. Consequently, he was instrumental in the enactment of the Civil Reform Act of 1978, a precursor to the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.

2006 Turkish Grand Prix

The 2006 Turkish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race, held on 27 August 2006. The race, which was the fourteenth round of the 2006 Formula One season, and the second Turkish Grand Prix, was held at Istanbul Park in Istanbul, Turkey. It marked the first race victory, and also the first pole position, for Felipe Massa, who drove for the Ferrari team. Fernando Alonso, who drove for Renault finished the race in second position and Massa's teammate Michael Schumacher occupied the final position on the podium. The race was also the first Grand Prix meeting for future quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who was assigned a Friday test driver role for the BMW Sauber team.
As a consequence of the race, Fernando Alonso extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 12 points from Michael Schumacher. With victory, Felipe Massa retained third place in the standings, and despite closing the gap between himself and Schumacher to 34 points, it was still near impossible for him to surpass his teammate's points total. This basically created a two-horse race for the title in the four remaining rounds. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Renault to just two points. McLaren remained in third position, a huge 69 points behind the top two teams.
Report.
Background.
Prior to the Grand Prix weekend, Renault's Fernando Alonso led the Formula One World Drivers' Championship on 100 points. He held a ten-point lead over main rival Michael Schumacher, despite retiring from the preceding race in Hungary. Ferrari teammates, Schumacher and Felipe Massa lay second and third in the standings on 90 and 52 points respectively, ahead of the second Renault of Giancarlo Fisichella and the McLaren of Kimi Räikkönen, both on 49 points.
Renault led the Constructors' Championship with 149 points, seven clear of Ferrari, while McLaren were in third position with 89 points. They were ahead of Honda F1, who sat in fourth with 52 after picking up their first and to be only victory since their return, three weeks before in Hungary. BMW Sauber completed the top five with 26 points.
Friday drivers.
The bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.
Practice and Qualifying.
Kimi Räikkönen set the fastest time in the first free practice session, despite only completing five laps; ahead of Michael Schumacher and Jenson Button, who were both just within half a second of Räikkönen's time. In the bottom half of the order, Felipe Massa finished the session 17th and Fernando Alonso 23rd. Neither of the Williams left the garage during the session. Sebastian Vettel impressed many as he set the fastest time in the second free practice session, on his first Grand Prix weekend appearance.
The following day however, in qualifying, it was Felipe Massa who set the fastest time, taking the first pole position of his career, ahead of Schumacher by one tenth of a second. The two Renaults occupied the next row with Alonso in front of Fisichella again. Fifth spot was initially taken up by Ralf Schumacher's Toyota, before he was demoted to fifteenth for a gearbox change. This was also true for Christijan Albers, who was taken from a good sixteenth place qualifying for the Midland team, to the back of the grid. Only four hundredths of a second separated Nick Heidfeld, Button and Räikkönen qualified from sixth to eighth before all moving up a place after Ralf Schumacher's penalty. Robert Kubica and Mark Webber completed the top ten fastest times, with Christian Klien completing the top ten on the starting grid.
Race.
The start of the race was affected by a multi-car accident entering the first corner. Massa, Michael Schumacher, Alonso and Fisichella all battled for position entering the first corner, with Fisichella spinning, causing a chain reaction behind him. During the chain reaction, Scott Speed collided with the McLaren of Räikkönen, causing one of Räikkönen's rear tyres to puncture. Räikkönen pitted for a new set of tyres, but soon faced a similar problem due to damaged bodywork; because of this he went straight off the outside of turn 4 and into a barrier, on the next lap. Nick Heidfeld, Fisichella, Speed and Ralf Schumacher all needed repairs from the incident, and the Midland of Tiago Monteiro was forced to retire.
On lap 13, Vitantonio Liuzzi, who had climbed to seventh place, lost control entering the first turn and spun, stalling the engine. The car was left stranded on the racing line at the exit of the corner, and the Safety Car was deployed. Massa, Schumacher, Alonso, Button, Kubica and Webber all came in to make pit stops whilst the Safety Car circulated. The first four drivers stayed at the front, but Webber and Kubica dropped to near the back of the pack. Alonso, however, was able to jump Schumacher, as his title rival was forced to 'stack' behind Massa before the mechanics could set to work on his car. The final 15 laps of the race were focused on Alonso and Michael Schumacher, who fought for second place behind Massa as part of their championship battle. Schumacher pursued Alonso for the last laps, but was unable to catch Alonso until the final corners of the final lap. Schumacher was right on the gearbox of Alonso exiting the last corner, but did not get past.
Thus, Massa took his first career Formula One victory, making it the second Grand Prix in a row with a first-time winner, following Button's win in Hungary three weeks earlier. It was the first time this had happened since 2003, when Räikkönen and Fisichella won their first victories at the consecutive Malaysian and Brazilian Grands Prix. Drivers' Championship rivals, Alonso and Schumacher completed what was to be a controversial podium ceremony. Button, de la Rosa, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello completed the points-scorers and the cars on the lead lap.
Post-race.
Podium display becomes international political incident.
The podium display after the race caused controversy when winner Felipe Massa received the trophy from Mehmet Ali Talat, who was referred to as the "President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus." This breakaway area of the island of Cyprus is only recognized by Turkey. The government of the Republic of Cyprus filed an official complaint with the FIA, the body governing the Formula One world championship. After investigating the incident, the FIA fined the organizers of the Grand Prix $5 million on September 19, 2006.

Circle Star Theater

The Circle Star Theatre was a performing arts venue in San Carlos, San Mateo County, California. Its name is based on it being a theater in the round, featuring a rotating circular stage with none of its 3,743 seats further than 50 feet (15 m) from the stage. Unlike similar venues across the United States, the Circle Star Theatre stage had the ability to rotate in either direction without limit, thanks to the slip ring and brush system that supplied electrical power and lighting signals to it. The theatre's address was 2 Circle Star Way, San Carlos, CA 94070.
Its original concept when it opened in the early 1960s was a dinner theater similar to the Hyatt House Theatre in nearby Burlingame. Lewis & Dare productions hosted many Broadway touring shows, such as The Odd Couple, with Ernest Borgnine and Don Rickles.
In 1971, the theatre was purchased by Marquee Entertainment, run by Don Jo Medlevine of the famed Chicago nightclub Chez Paree. Marquee Entertainment booked Las Vegas acts such as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin, Wayne Newton, among many others. In the mid-1970s the theatre was kept solvent by booking Motown acts to increase its diversity.
Performers.
The following musicians, actors, and comedians are among those who appeared at the Circle Star:
Fate.
Don Jo Medlevine sold the Circle Star Theater to Dr. Leonard Bloom. Dr. Bloom later sold the theater to a local car dealer. The new ownership did not have the same elite relationships with the top entertainers as Dr. Bloom had, so it was closed in December 1993. The building caught fire on April 18, 1997, damaging much of the backstage area, though by this time plans had already been made for its demolition. The theater was ultimately demolished to make way for the Circle Star Center, a complex containing two four-story office buildings and a small hotel.

2006 Italian Grand Prix

The 2006 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 2006 at Autodromo Nazionale Monza. It was the fifteenth round of the 2006 Formula One season, and was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari car.
Immediately following the race, Michael Schumacher announced that he would retire from motor racing at the end of the 2006 season. Robert Kubica achieved his first career podium finish, in only his third Grand Prix. It was also only the second Grand Prix meeting appearance of Kubica's Friday driver successor, Sebastian Vettel. Vettel had impressed at the by setting the fastest time in one session, but he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions at this Grand Prix. The race was also the first race to see the introduction of a new High Speed Barrier developed by the FIA Institute and the FIA. The system, which was installed at the end of the run-off areas at the circuit’s second chicane and "Parabolica" corners, was designed for use at corners with high speed approaches and limited run-off areas. Also this was the last race of the Red Bull driver Christian Klien, until his return to a race seat at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix.
After the race, in the press conference, Michael Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula One. The race was his 90th victory. Three years later however in , Schumacher returned to F1 with Mercedes.

Southminster

Southminster is a town on the Dengie peninsula in the Maldon district of Essex in the East of England. It lies about three miles north of Burnham-on-Crouch and ten miles south-east of Maldon. To the north is the River Blackwater, which is tidal and since Roman times has been the gateway to trading in the area.
History.
Southminster is in the centre of the Dengie peninsula, which once formed a hundred of the same name.
A major horse market used to be held annually in the town.
Southminster marshes were a favourite centre for hare coursing in Victorian times.
Pandole Wood contains ancient earthworks believed to date from the Iron Age. The landscape surrounding the town, and elsewhere on the peninsula, is characterized by a pattern of strictly rectangular field boundaries, with evidence of a unit of measurement having been applied to the scheme as a whole. Middle-Saxon administrations have been suggested as its origin, although the road to the Roman sea fort at Bradwell also conforms to the pattern.
St Leonard's Church.
The medieval St Leonard's Church dates mainly from the 15th century, although there are traces of much earlier work. It is a relatively large, "townish" church by Essex standards. The church also stands at an important road junction, contrasting with the familiar Essex pattern of a church and manor house complex on the same site. These features are consistent with John Blair's formulation of an Anglo-Saxon minster, in contrast to a private oratory in its origins, and the placename would perhaps suggest Cedd's mission at St.Peter's on the wall at Bradwell as its parent. 
There have been several well-known rectors, including naturalist Rev Walter Henry Hill, and Rev Alexander John Scott who was personal chaplain to Admiral Lord Nelson.
After the Battle of Trafalgar Nelson died in the arms of Rev Scott.
Several artefacts that once belonged to Rev Scott are found in the church.
The church also gives its name to the town's local football team, Southminster St. Leonards F.C.
Facilities.
The town has one primary school, a small library, a handful of pubs, a police station,a swimming pool and one holiday park
Transport.
Southminster railway station, the terminus of a single-line branch that was electrified in the 1980s, provides services to Wickford and Liverpool Street station in the City of London.

Four Golden Princess

Four Golden Princesses (Chinese: 四千金) is a China-based Malaysian girl group that consists of members Ginger Keong Hueh Chin, Mins Eng Lee Min, Samantha Ee Kai Chee and Richell Lee Lian Hong. They are best known by their stage names Chin Er, Min Er, Kai Er, and Hong Er (the Chinese word "er" means "child" or "young"), though in the last several years of their performances, they began to use their given names more frequently.
Career.
Originally known as "Four Little Golden Princesses", and commonly abbreviated to FGP or 4GP, they were recruited by recording company Ya-Ko Enterprise around 1995, after mass success of child star, Crystal Ong Shir Ching, who is currently a member of M-girls. At that time, the members of Four Golden Princesses averaged 5–6 years old (Ginger was born in 1988 and the others in 1990). Each of them hail from different parts of Malaysia, but they were brought together at company headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on school holidays and weekends for recording sessions or promotions. As they grew older and remained popular, the word "Little" was quietly dropped from the group name.
They made their debut effort in a compilation album in August 1996 (album title unknown). Under the management of Ya-Ko Enterprise, the Four Golden Princesses released 3 "Happy Children’s Songs" albums and 1 "Chinese New Year 1997" album. Each album grossed more than 50,000 copies sold, which made an astonishing figure for local artists.
In September 1997, the parents of Four Golden Princesses filed a lawsuit against Ya-Ko Enterprise for the non-payment of contractual fees. The parents claimed that they had only received partial payment for one-and-a-half albums. With the lawsuit was settled out of court, Four Golden Princess was permanently switched to another recording company called "Wayang Tinggi Entertainment (WTE)" as of October 1, 1997.
Over the years with WTE, Four Golden Princesses has recorded and filmed over 20 albums (8 albums under the "Children’s Wonderland" series, 3 under the "Golden Folk Songs" series, and 10 Chinese New Year albums). Each of them are best sellers, giving the group's title "Super Child Star". They also recorded a number of popular songs (especially in their teens) with several songs that are combinations of Chinese and American songs.
Their Chinese New Year albums have become a trademark success. At what was perhaps the peak of their child-group popularity around 1999-2001, their album "Dancing Dragons Dazzle in Beijing City 1999" sold over 100,000 copies in Malaysia and another 450,000 in China; "Lovable Dragon Year 2000" over 125,000; and their "Dance of the Golden Snake 2001" over 100,000 in Malaysia alone.
In early 2003, Min Er announced her intention to leave the group to concentrate on her studies. She had always been the most academically diligent member of the group and dreamt of a career as a doctor since childhood. However, much to the relief of their legion of fans, Min Er decided to remain in the group after much persuasion from her friends and fans.
On June 5, 2004, Four Golden Princesses celebrated their 10th anniversary as a group with a mini concert at Malaysia’s UE3. They were the first child group to last 10 years (or even 5 years) from Malaysia’s music scene. Along with growing up, they have progressed from singing nursery rhymes to children songs to school folk songs and love songs. All these categories of songs were showcased in this concert. Hearing Four Golden Princesses re-sing their nursery tunes again, a childhood innocence in their voice is no longer felt.
Around November 2004, a video from their very early days circulated around the internet in Taiwan. "The Laughing Song" featuring their shaking heads and funny lyrics caused the internet news to spread quickly. "Why is Math class your favorite? Because my teacher is always absent!" or "Today I got 100%, English 50%, Math 50%, add it together, and I have 100%" became favorite quotes amongst Taiwan teens. Taiwan youth even filmed their own version of the music video to this song. Although this sudden surge of popularity in Taiwan was a result from them being mocked, it also lead numerous people to learn about the recent Four Golden Princesses and converted some into fans as well. One of the websites devoted to Four Golden Princess, www.fourgoldenprincess.com, was so overwhelmed by the amount of people visiting that its bandwidth ran out very early in the month, something that never happened before.
The last album was released for Chinese New Year 2008, followed by their disbandment, though the members occasionally get together to do public performances during the Chinese new years. Their reason was that they want to lead to a normal life.
In late September 2012, behind the scene pictures of the two Four Golden Princesses members Ginger and Richell filming a CNY album with 6 other artists appeared on the Facebook page 8大贺岁. It was confirmed that the group 八大巨星(Eight Superstars) would reform. Four Golden Princesses were previously in their 1999 CNY album and briefly in their 2000 CNY album. The page said that the album would be released in December.
On 22 July 2013, Nick Chung(A Chinese Malaysian artist) leaked a photograph of himself on his Facebook page showing a picture of him with Ginger and Richell recording what looked like an album together. It was confirmed on 30 July that they were indeed recording a new Chinese New Year Album and were asking for four males and females aged 18–26 to take place in their MV shooting on 13 August. 
This EP album Golden Princess Celebrate the New Year (千金慶新年) contains 3 songs sung by Ginger and Richell and marks their final album ever released as the two members are busy and are unable to produce albums anymore.

Pepi III

Seneferankhre Pepi III may have been a pharaoh of the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. According to Wolfgang Helck he was the fifth pharaoh of the dynasty. Alternatively, according to Jürgen von Beckerath, he was the thirteenth pharaoh of the dynasty. Because his position in the 16th dynasty is highly uncertain, it is not clear who were his predecessor and successor.
Seneferankhre Pepy III is only attested by a scarab-shaped seal bearing his name. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt contests the seal as evidence that Pepi was a king of the 16th dynasty, positing that the seal does not date to the second intermediate period (SIP). According to Ryholt: ""the size and design (prenomen + nomen without cartouche or royal titulary/epithets) of this seal is unparalleled during the SIP. Also the style of the signs is quite dissimilar to SIP seals."" 
Instead, Ryholt proposes that the seal of Seneferankhre Pepy III be dated to the First Intermediate Period, noting however that this is a very early date for a scarab seal.

<doc id="5978232" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5978232" title="Nebmaatre">
Nebmaatre

Nebmaatre is the prenomen of a poorly attested ruler of the late Second Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt. Nebmaatre may have been a member of the early 17th dynasty and as such would have reigned over the Theban region. Alternatively, Jürgen von Beckerath believes that Nebmaatre was a ruler of the late 16th Dynasty.
__FORCETOC__
Attestations.
The prenomen "Nebmaatre" is attested on a bronze axe-head discovered in a tomb at Mostagedda in Middle Egpyt and now in the British Museum under the catalog number BM EA 63224. The same prenomen is inscribed on a black steatite amulet representing a lion of unknown provenance and now in the Petrie Museum under the catalog number 11587. A degree of uncertainty affects the ownership of these artifacts since Amenhotep III's prenomen was Nebmaatre as well. However, the axe-head can be dated to the late second intermediate period based on stylistic grounds and provenance while according to Flinders Petrie the amulet is of too rough a worksmanship to be attributable to Amenhotep III. Instead Petrie suggested that the amulet be attributable to Ibi, an obscure ruler of the late 13th dynasty whose prenomen is partially preserved in Turin canon as ""[...]maatre"". However, Kim Ryholt's recent study of the Turin canon precludes this identification as a vertical stroke in the lacuna just prior to "maatre" rules out the hieroglyph for "neb".
Chronological position.
The chronological position of Nebmaatre in the second intermediate period is highly uncertain. The egyptologist Jürgen von Beckerath proposes that Nebmaatre was a ruler of a compounded 15th-16th dynasty, which he sees as an entirely Hyksos line of kings. Alternatively, Kim Ryholt put forth the hypothesis that Nebmaatre was a king of the 17th dynasty, although he left his position in the dynasty unspecified.

<doc id="5978235" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5978235" title="Matija Murko">
Matija Murko

Matija Murko also known as Mathias Murko (10 February 1861 – 11 February 1952) was a Slovene scholar, known mostly for his work on oral epic traditions in Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian.
Life.
Murko was born in the small village of Drstelja near Ptuj, Lower Styria, in what was then the Austrian Empire and is now in Slovenia. He attended high school in Ptuj and Maribor. He studied Slavic and Germanic philology at the University of Vienna, where he was a pupil of Franc Miklošič. After obtaining his PhD in Vienna in 1886, he went to postdoctoral studies to Moscow. From 1897 to 1902, he taught Slavic philology at the University of Vienna, from 1902 to 1917 at the University of Graz, and from 1917 to 1920 at the University of Leipzig. From 1920 to 1931, he taught at Charles University in Prague, where he settled and lived until his death in 1952. At the Charles University he founded the "Slavic Institute" (Slovanský ústav), which he led until 1941.
Murko had an intense social life and was a personal friend of figures as Ivan Hribar, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Karel Kramář. During his lifetime, he became a member of numerous academies of sciences around Europe, especially in Slavic countries: the Yugoslav, the Serbian, the Czech, the Soviet, the Bulgarian, the Polish and the Slovenian. He conferred a doctorate "honoris causa" by Charles University in Prague in 1909 and by the University of Ljubljana in 1951.
Work and influence.
Murko was trained in the positivistic style of philology. He published several scientific works in the field of ethnology, cultural and literary history. Influenced by the historian Karl Lamprecht, Murko published the book "Geschichte der aeltern slawischen Literaturen" ("History of Ancient Slavic Literatures", Leipzig, 1908), in which he presented the older Slavic literatures as a reflection of their collective cultural and social life of those people. He also wrote on the history of Slovenian literature, especially on Prešeren and Protestant authors from the 16th century, such as Primož Trubar, Jurij Dalmatin and Sebastijan Krelj.
Since Murko published mostly in German and French, his work was little known to scholars unfamiliar with these languages, but it had an important influence on Milman Parry, who was studying for his doctorate at the Sorbonne in Paris under Antoine Meillet, at the time when Murko's major work appeared in French.
His work was praised by the renowned Austrian critic Hermann Bahr, who regarded it as one of the finest examples of style in contemporary scientific prose. Murko also influenced the development of modern Slovenian literary history, especially Fran Ilešič, Ivan Prijatelj, and France Kidrič.

2006 Chinese Grand Prix

The 2006 Chinese Grand Prix was the sixteenth race of the 2006 Formula One season. It was held on 1 October 2006 at Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai. The race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, and would turn out to be the 91st and last victory of his long and distinguished Formula One career. It was also his last podium finish until the 2012 European Grand Prix, during his comeback to the sport. 
Report.
Background.
Renault were very confident about their chances in this Grand Prix, they claimed that Michael Schumacher's previous two races in Shanghai were "poor". Schumacher did admit that he had bad form in China, but said that he expected it "to be better this time around."
Following back-to-back wins in Turkey and on home soil, Ferrari certainly had the momentum coming into the Grand Prix, the Italian team were also ahead of Renault by 3 points in the constructors championship and Michael Schumacher was 2 points behind Fernando Alonso in the Drivers' Championship.
Following Lewis Hamilton's GP2 victory in Monza and an encouraging test session with McLaren, the Woking based team were rumoured to give the young British driver his debut in favour of Pedro de la Rosa, who had been performing well after replacing Juan Pablo Montoya. However, McLaren announced that de la Rosa would be racing in China. McLaren's other driver, Kimi Räikkönen, was aiming to win the weekend's Grand Prix following signs of speed in his previous Grand Prix.
Williams announced that they were using a revised FW28, the Williams-Cosworth FW28A. The car featured a new aerodynamic package developed by test drivers Alexander Wurz and Narain Karthikeyan. The test team also carried out the first track test of the Toyota-powered interim Williams FW28B. The car itself completed 745 kilometres and the team only experienced minor problems.
Following some impressive Friday test performances at Turkey and Italy, BMW Sauber's 19-year old test driver, Sebastian Vettel, had agreed to see out the rest of the year with the German team. The young German driver had a busy schedule, as he was also competing in the Formula 3 Euroseries.
With the sacking of Christian Klien, Red Bull announced that Robert Doornbos would replace him for the final 3 Grands Prix. Replacing Doornbos' role as the third driver was GP2 driver Michael Ammermüller.
Toro Rosso announced during the week leading up to the Grand Prix, that they had signed Alex Hitzinger as their new technical director to replace Gabriele Tredozi. Hitzinger began his role in November 2006.
Spyker MF1 announced their first driver for 2007 during the weekend, which was Dutch driver Christijan Albers.
Super Aguri's Takuma Sato had a dismal start to the weekend as he was demoted ten places on the grid as his team changed the Honda engine in his car. Sato had been due to continue using the Honda V8 he ran at the last round in Italy, but the discovery of a problem, which had not been disclosed by Super Aguri, had prompted the team to replace the engine ahead of the Friday first practice session.
Friday practice.
Alexander Wurz was fastest in the first Friday practice session in the Williams-Cosworth, 0.004 seconds faster than BMW Sauber's third driver, Sebastien Vettel and Jenson Button completed the top three, over six tenths slower than Wurz. Michael Schumacher, Neel Jani and Alexandre Prémat completed the top six; all within 0.07 seconds of each other. While Schumacher's championship rival, Fernando Alonso, did not set a time along with his team mate, Giancarlo Fisichella.
Wurz and Vettel were fastest again in the second session, Wurz was fastest with a 1:35.539, around 0.03 seconds faster than he was in the first session and 0.05 seconds faster than Vettel with Honda's Anthony Davidson completing the top three positions. The Austrian was very happy with his time, specially since this was his first time in Shanghai, "It was a good day today and driving was a lot of fun out there. I have never driven this circuit, and I attacked it right from the beginning" he said. Championship rivals, Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso, were within a tenth of a second of each other in fifth and sixth, respectively. Felipe Massa dropped ten places from the grid after his engine gave way during the session.
Friday drivers.
The bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.
Race.
It rained heavily before the start of the race, suiting the Michelin runners and disadvantaging the Bridgestone runners. Fernando Alonso led away at the start, followed by Giancarlo Fisichella. Kimi Räikkönen passed both Hondas at the start and immediately started to pressure Fisichella. Robert Kubica and Robert Doornbos collided, resulting in Kubica being knocked of the track and Doornbos losing his front wing. On lap 8, Michael Schumacher overtook Rubens Barichello for fifth. On lap 14, Schumacher passed Jenson Button for fourth. On the same lap Raikkonen finally managed to pass Fisichella, having been stuck behind him ever since the start. Raikkonen immediately began to pull away from Fisichella and erode the 15 second gap to Alonso. At this point in the race, Alonso was over 25 seconds ahead of Schumacher. However, the track was now drying and beginning to favour the Bridgestones more and more. By lap 19, Schumacher had caught up to Fisichella. He was also gaining on Alonso, who was beginning to struggle with his tyres and had several off-track moments. Schumacher gained another place when Raikkonen retired with a mechanical failure. Raikkonen later said that he felt he could have won the race, as he had been steadily gaining on Alonso before his retirement.
The new leading trio of Alonso, Fisichella and Schumacher made their first pitstops on laps 22, 23 and 21, respectively. Fisichella and Schumacher both kept all the same tyres, but Alonso, whose tyres were already fading, was unsure about whether they could last all the way to the second pitstops, so he changed the front tyres, but left the same rear tyres. However, this disadvantaged him even more, and within a few laps his 20-second lead had evaporated to nothing. For several laps, Alonso, Fisichella and Schumacher ran nose to tail. On lap 29, Fisichella tried to pass Alonso down the back straight, but braked too late and ran wide, allowing Alonso to regain the lead. The following lap, he pulled off the maneuver successfully and immediately began to pull away. Only a few corners later, at the start of lap 31, Schumacher passed Alonso and chased after Fisichella. He was able to stay with him but unable to seriously threaten to overtake.
Alonso dropped back all the time and on lap 35, having seen several drivers switch to dry tyres and be able to handle the drying conditions, pitted and made the switch. However a wheel nut problem at his stop caused it to last over 19 seconds. When he emerged from his stop he was down in 4th and over 50 seconds off the lead. Schumacher and Fisichella were among the last drivers to switch to dry tyres, pitting on laps 40 and 41 respectively. Fisichella emerged from his stop still ahead of Schumacher, but struggling with his cold tyres ran wide at the first corner, allowing Schumacher through into the lead.
Alonso had now rediscovered his pace and charged in the closing stages, setting fastest lap after fastest lap. Fisichella let him past without a fight, but although he continued to close rapidly on Schumacher, he ran out of time to catch him, finishing just 3 seconds behind. Fisichella had dropped back hugely in the closing laps but hung on to a comfortable third place. 
Nick Heidfeld had started eighth on the grid but through his strategy of pitting late at both pitstops had rising to fourth in the closing stages, leapfrogging Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button and Pedro de la Rosa. However, in the closing stages Heidfeld was firstly forced of the track while trying to lap Christijan Albers, then held up by Takuma Sato's Super Aguri, allowing Barrichello, Button and de la Rosa to close up to him. Button first managed to find his way past Barrichello on the last lap, then, at the penultimate corner, boxed Heidfeld in behind Sato, taking fourth. Barrichello then braked too late at the same corner, running into the back of Heidfeld, knocking the BMW Sauber's right rear wheel askew and damaging his own front wing. This allowed de la Rosa through to take fifth, Barrichello sixth, and the furious Heidfeld limped home seventh.
Post-race.
The result put Michael Schumacher equal on points with Fernando Alonso, and in the championship lead on countback. However, Fisichella's third place allowed Renault to regain the lead of the constructor's championship by one point from Ferrari, as well as vaulting Fisichella ahead of Felipe Massa in the battle for third in the driver's championship, also by one point. After the race, Schumacher expressed his surprise at the performance of his car in the wet, after its dismal showing in qualifying. Alonso expressed his regret over the decision to change only the front tyres at his first stop, but also his encouragement at the pace his car had shown throughout the weekend. Both championship contenders were confident heading into the final two races of the season.

Frank Tomney

Frank Tomney (24 May 1908 – 19 September 1984) was a British Labour Party politician. 
Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Tomney found himself jobless during the Great Depression and walked to London in search of employment. After arriving in London he moved into the Rowton House in Hammersmith, a hostel for working men. This was to be the beginning of a long association with that area of west London. 
Tomney obtained work as a night-watchman in a glass blowing factory, and became an active trade unionist. From 1940 he was branch secretary of the General and Municipal Workers Union. 
With an approaching general election in 1950, the Labour Party found itself without a candidate at Hammersmith North. The sitting member of parliament, D. N. Pritt, had been expelled from the party and had won the seat in 1945 as a member of the left-wing Labour Independent Group. Tomney volunteered to stand, and was comfortably elected with a majority of nearly 3,000 votes over Pritt. He was re-elected at each election until he stood down in 1979, and was seen as being on the right wing of the Labour Party, a fact that was often to lead to conflict within the constituency party in Hammersmith North. 
Tomney took an interest in European and international affairs, and was a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union on a number of occasions between 1963 and 1979. In 1968 he was leader of the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations, and from 1976-79 was a Member of the European Parliament. 
He lived in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, and was a member of Watford Town Council from 1946-50 and of Hertfordshire County Council from 1950-54. 
Tomney retired from the House of Commons in 1979. He died aged 76 in Hillingdon Hospital.

Complete protein

A complete protein (or whole protein) is a source of protein that contains an adequate proportion of all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for the dietary needs of humans or other animals. Some incomplete protein sources may contain all essential amino acids, but a complete protein contains them in correct proportions for supporting biological functions in the human body. 
The following table lists the optimal profile of the essential amino acids, which comprises a complete protein, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board:
The following table shows the amino acid requirements of adults as recommended by the World Health Organization calculated for a 62-kilogram adult, and the amino acid profile of 2530 kilocalories of baked potatoes (9 large baked potatoes), which comprise a day's worth of calories for a 62-kilogram (136 lb) adult:
Nearly all foods contain all twenty amino acids in some quantity, and nearly all of them contain the essential amino acids in sufficient quantity. Proportions vary, however, and some foods are deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids. Though some vegetable sources of protein contain sufficient values of all essential amino acids, many are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal sources, especially lysine, and to a lesser extent methionine and threonine. However, as shown in the example of potatoes, above, nearly all foods provide sufficient amino acids to satisfy human requirements.
Consuming a mixture of plant-based protein sources can increase the biological value of food. For example, to obtain 25 grams of complete protein from canned pinto beans requires consuming 492 grams (423 kcal); however, only 364 g of pinto beans (391 kcal) are required if they are combined with 12 grams of Brazil nuts. Complementary proteins need not be eaten at the same meal for your body to use them together. Studies now show that your body can combine complementary proteins that are eaten within 24 hours.

Bob Luman

Robert Glynn "Bob" Luman (15 April 1937 – 27 December 1978) was an American country and rockabilly singer.
Early life and career.
Luman was born in Blackjack, Texas, but raised in Nacogdoches, Texas. His early interest in music was influenced by his father, an amateur fiddle, guitar and harmonica player. Bob Luman received his first guitar when he was thirteen years of age.
Luman attended high school in Kilgore, where the family had moved after young Bob's birth. It was in high school that Luman started his first band.
Bob Luman had been a baseball star in his high school, and he tried out with the Major League Baseball Pittsburgh Pirates, but when he didn't make it in professional baseball, he decided to concentrate on music. In 1956, he won a talent contest promoted by the Future Farmers of America, which earned him an appearance on the "Louisiana Hayride".
For the "Hayride", Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows, including James Burton on guitar, James Kirkland on bass and Butch White on drums. In 1957, the band signed with Imperial Records, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues."
That same year, the band appeared on the "Town Hall Party" in Los Angeles, and appeared in the movie "Carnival Rock", where they backed up David Houston.
The following year, having been dropped by Imperial Records, Luman signed with Capitol Records, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name, which he refused to do, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta."
In 1960, Luman was inducted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit, "Let's Think About Living," a novelty song that hit No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 9 on the "Billboard" country music chart. It also reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. 
After leaving the Army in 1962, Luman moved to Nashville, where he married. In 1965, he joined the Grand Ole Opry.
Later career.
Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s, and became popular in Las Vegas, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968, and had several hits with them, including "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" and "Still Loving You." "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" became his biggest country hit, hitting No. 4 on the country chart. (Steve Wariner, who had earlier been a member of Luman's band, later covered the song in 1984, and he, too, took it to No. 4 on the country charts.)
Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968), "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman, 1968), "When You Say Love" (1972), "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973), "Proud Of You Baby" (1975), and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Perhaps his most unusual song was a slow, soulful recitation of Johnny Cash's "I Still Miss Someone."
Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978, at the age of forty-one. After his death, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs, including "More of the Rocker", "Still Rockin"' and "Carnival Rock".
Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.

Dominican Church, Vienna

The Dominican Church (), also known as the Church of St. Maria Rotunda, is an early Baroque parish church and minor basilica in the historic center of Vienna, Austria. It is the third church built on the same site in the course of time.
History.
The first church on this site was built in 1237 by the newly arrived Dominicans on a piece of land allotted in 1225-1226 by the duke Leopold VI. The church was enlarged between 1240–1270 and a new choir was added in 1273. A series of fires caused the construction of a new Gothic church between 1283 and 1302. The nave was extended between 1458 and 1474. This church consisted of a nave with five cross vaults, and two aisles.
This church was heavily damaged during the first siege of Vienna by the Turkish army in 1529. The choir was demolished and the nave was partly taken down. The building became more and more dilapidated during the next period.
The new-found self-awareness of the Counter-Reformation didn’t allow any more such a sorry state for a church. In 1631 the Dominicans started to build a new oblong church with a dome, following the plan of Jacopo Tencala, architect of Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein. The master builders were Jacopo Spacio, Cipriano Biasino and Antonio Canevale. They introduced to Vienna the Baroque style of Italy. The first stone was laid by emperor Ferdinand II on 29 May 1631. The structural work was finished in 1634. The church was consecrated on 1 October 1634. The finishing touch was finally given in 1674. The church was elevated to the status of basilica minor in 1927 under the name “Rosary Basilica ad S. Mariam Rotundam”.
Facade.
The impressive facade was built in the Roman-Lombardic style with dominant columns, supporting the cornice. Its architecture goes back to early Baroque churches in Rome, that in turn, rely on the facade of the Dominican church Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Above the portal one can see the statues of St. Catherine of Siena and Agnes of Montepulciano, kneeling at the feet of Our Lady, patron saint of this church. On both sides of the portal there are niches with (on the left) the statue of Ludwig Bertrand and (on the right) Saint Rose of Lima. On top of the facade is a large rectangular gable with a dormer window, crowned by a pediment.
Interior.
The church consists of a long central nave, flanked by three side chapels on each side, a transept, a choir and an apse. The nave is 25 m long, 14 m wide and 22.10 m high. The large dome reaches a height of 23.80 m. Above each side chapel is gallery with a shallow balcony.
Frescoes.
The ornate interior is imposing by its architecture and the exquisite stucco in the decorations. Semi-circular windows allow a soft light on the frescoes of the barrel-vaulted ceiling. These are the work of Matthias Rauchmiller (1675), showing in their color and composition the influence of Peter Paul Rubens. They depict in 46 scenes the life of Our Lady. The influential painter Carpoforo Tencalla decorated at the same time the apse around the main altar with two historic paintings of Christian victories, ascribed to power of the Rosary : the Battle of Muret (1213) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571). Tencala also added some paintings on the walls of the side chapels. The fresco in the dome replaced an earlier work by Nikolaus van Hoy (1674) when the new dome was built in 1820. The fresco dates from 1836 and is by Franz Geyling. It shows "Our Lady and Child" under the golden light of the Trinity, surrounded by kneeling Angels. The medaillons in the four supporting columns are by an unknown artist, depicting three popes from the Order of Dominicans (Innocent V, Benedict XI and Pius V) and St. Antony of Florence. The large statues in these columns show us the four original Doctors of the Church (Jerome, Gregory the Great, Augustine and Ambrose), all sculpted by a local artist.
Main altar.
The apse is dominated by the imposing red-marbled wooden retable in Baroque style from 1839-1840 by Carl Roesner, replacing the dilapidated old altarpiece. It surrounds the large canvas (720 cm x 430 cm) by Leopold Kuppelwieser (1840), flanked by red Corinthian columns. It depicts the establishment by pope Pius V of the "Feast of the Rosary". The tabernacle dates from 1885 and is made of gilded brass.
Pulpit.
The gilded pulpit dates from 1700 and was made by Matthias Steinl. It was modeled on an engraving by Jean le Pautre (1618–1682), that now can be seen at the Martin von Wagner Museum in Würzburg, Germany. The antependium shows a blue globe surrounded by a rosary and below, in the medaillon, the motto “toto diffunditur orbe” (spread all over the world). On the canopy of the pulpit the Holy Spirit, represented in the form of a dove, is surrounded by a halo of light and angels in elegant poses.
Side chapels.
Each of the six chapels is dedicated to a saint, portrayed in the painting above the altar. The altars are the rather unpretentious work of workshops. The figures are of diverse quality.
The organ.
The main body of the organ was made in two parts at about 1750 according to the traditions of the Vienna organ builders of that time. The gilded concave-convex balustrade of the rood loft is a typical example of the transition between Baroque and Rococo. The organ with 34 registers dates from 1895–1896 and was renovated in 1991.
The painting under the rood loft is by an anonymous master from 1642 and depicts the glorification of the rosary and the mediation via Saint Dominic.

2006 Japanese Grand Prix

The 2006 Japanese Grand Prix was the seventeenth race of the 2006 Formula One season. It was held between 6–8 October at Suzuka International Racing Course, Suzuka. It was won by Fernando Alonso, his last win for the Renault team before he moved to McLaren the following season. It was the first Formula One race to be broadcast in HDTV by Fuji Television, and was the 20th Grand Prix to be held at Suzuka.
Felipe Massa started the race from pole, but Michael Schumacher soon passed him on lap 3 to take the lead. Schumacher was well on his way to victory and an undisputed lead in the championship with 1 race to go. On lap 37, Schumacher's engine failed, his first engine failure since the 2000 French Grand Prix, giving the lead to Fernando Alonso, who went on to win the race. This virtually gave the championship to Alonso. This was the most recent victory for Michelin, who pulled out of Formula One at the end of the season. Giancarlo Fisichella dedicated his third place finish to his best friend, Tonino Visciani, who died on 5 October 2006 after a heart attack.

<doc id="5978317" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5978317" title="Quran and miracles">
Quran and miracles

Muslims consider the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, as the word of God and a miracle. According to Islamic tradition, the Qur'an was revealed miraculously to Muhammad by Allah (God) through angel, Jibrīl (Gabriel), as a perfect, verbatim copy of what was written in heaven and that had existed there for all of eternity.
The Qur'an states that Muhammad neither read a book nor wrote a book and that he did not know about past events . So, from a widely held Muslim perspective, this suggests that since Muhammad had no previous knowledge of the content in the Qur'an, it was in fact composed of miracles. Some Muslims believe that the Qur'an is "a miracle of eloquence", rather than a source of scientific revelation, and consider scientific miracles as illusions from devils. However, the majority of modern Muslim thinkers accept the miracles found in the Qur'an and their compatibility with science. But, there still exists disagreement regarding the alleged miracles of the saints.
The definition of a miracle is "a marvellous event not ascribable to human power or the operation of any natural force and therefore attributed to supernatural, esp. divine, agency; esp. an act (e.g. of healing) showing control over nature and used as evidence that the agent is either divine or divinely favoured."
The commonly claimed miracles of the Qur'an can be classified into three categories: inimitability, scientific miracles, and prophecies.
Miracles that may relate to Muhammad.
Several verses that appear in the Qur'an would suggest that certain miracles occurred just in relation to Muhammad: the splitting of the moon (Qur'an 54:2-1), assistance given to Muslims at the Battle of Badr (Qur'an 3:120F), and the night journey (Qur'an 17:1).
Scientific miracles.
The belief that Qur'an had prophesied scientific theories and discoveries has become widely popular in the contemporary Islamic world. These prophecies are often provided as a proof of the divine origin of the Qur'an. There are many examples of scientific facts mentioned in the Qur'an that were unsupported by the scientific knowledge and beliefs of the time, but have since proved accurate due to modern technology. Some examples are listed below.
"The expansion of the universe"
The size of the universe has long been in question, but it was not until 1929 when Edwin Hubble, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, proposed that the universe was expanding. But the text of the Qur'an acknowledges this idea in the following verse: “And it is We who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it” (Qur'an 51:47).
"Orbits"
German mathematician, astronomer and astrologer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) is attributed with correctly identifying planetary motion. His laws of planetary motion concluded that planets move in almost-circular shaped orbits called ellipses. He published these laws in 1609 and 1619. 
However, the Qur'an mentions orbits in the following verses: 
"It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They swim along, each in an orbit. " (Qur'an, 21:33). 
"By the sky full of paths and orbits" (Qur'an 51:7).
"The Sky"
The sky serves very important functions for life on Earth. The greenhouse effect idea was popularized in the 1800s. It claims that energy radiated by the sun reaches Earth in the form of heat. Some of the heat is trapped due to gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane. The atmosphere keeps the Earth at a temperature that sustains life. Without this protection, the Earth would be exposed to the below freezing temperatures of outer space. In addition, the ozone layer of the atmosphere protects the Earth and its living inhabitants from harmful radiation rays and meteors. 
The protective capabilities of the sky were only discovered in the 19th century, yet the Qur'an states the following: "We made the sky a preserved and protected roof yet still they turn away from Our Signs.." (Qur'an, 21:32).
"Mountains"
The theory of continental drift was proposed by Alfred Wegener, a meteorologist, in 1915. He suggested that the world was originally composed of a single land mass or continent, and that the continents then separated and moved very slowly apart, forming the 7 continents today, and still in motion. The theory of plate tectonics which was developed from continental drift supports this idea and provides evidence of how the plates of the Earth move. 
The Qur'an says: "You will see the mountains you reckoned to be solid going past like clouds" (Qur'an, 27:88).
"Time"
German-born physicist Albert Einstein formulated the general theory of relativity in 1915. This theory is a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. According to general relativity processes close to a massive body run more slowly than those farther away, an effect known as gravitational time dilation. Gravity has a direct effect on time. Although this theory was not formulated until the early 1900s, the Qur'an says the following:
"They ask you to hasten the punishment. God will not break His promise. A day with your Lord is equivalent to a thousand years in the way you count" (Qur'an, 22:47). 
"He directs the whole affair from heaven to earth. Then it will again ascend to Him on a Day whose length is a thousand years by the way you measure" (Qur'an, 32:5). 
The Qur'an, which is believed to be the word of God, demonstrates perfect knowledge of the relativity of time long before Einstein’s theories were created.
These are just a sample of the many statements in the Qur'an that can be considered to predict scientific discoveries. Muhammad was an illiterate man who would have been incapable of writing the Qur'an, which leads believers to claim that it must have been revealed to him through God.
Islamic scholar Zaghloul El-Naggar believes that the verse, ""A time is fixed for every prophecy; you will come to know in time"", refers to statements in the Qur'an that predict scientific discoveries made centuries later
In the Muslim world some believe that scientific discoveries were predicted, while others do not. saying that the Qur'an is not a book of science. Al-Biruni, one of the most celebrated Muslim scientists of the classical period, assigned to the Qur'an a separate and autonomous realm of its own and held that the Qur'an "does not interfere in the business of science, nor does it infringe on the realm of science." These scholars maintain the possibility of multiple scientific explanations of natural phenomena and do not subordinate the Qur'an to an ever-changing science.
Prophecies.
Throughout the Qur'an, claims or predictions are made concerning future events. Many of the prophecies are viewed as having metaphoric meanings, while others are taken more literally. Because Muslims believe that the Qur'an contains the exact words of God which were revealed to the prophet Muhammad in Arabic and later transcribed, the meaning of the Qur'an has a great effect on Muslim beliefs and understandings. The sheer number of prophecies which Muslims believe to have been fulfilled bolster faith and conviction, generally serving as proof that the Qur'an is indeed of a divine origin. Some prophecies are debated more than others as to whether or not they were actually fulfilled or how the Qur'anic text should be interpreted.
One of the more general prophecies is that the Qur'an predicts its own preservation and endurance. The Qur'an states that the book itself will survive as a valid source and that the religion of Islam will last, even dominate, because of this. Muslim scholars argue that today's Qur'an is the same Qur'an originally compiled by Prophet Muhammad. 
The following passages from the Qur'an state these prophecies:
“We have, without doubt, Sent down the Message; And We will assuredly Guard it (from corruption)” (15:9).
“It is He Who has sent His Apostle with Guidance And the Religion of Truth, That he may proclaim it Over all religion, Even though the Pagans May detest (it)” (61:9).
Another interpretation of the Qur'an is that it predicted the defeat of the Persians by the Romans. Before the prophecy, at the Battle of Antioch, in 613 C.E., the Persians defeated the Romans. Muslims were upset by this defeat because they felt more connected to Rome, a Christian empire, than to Persia, a Zoroastrian one. A few years afterwards, the following verse was revealed in the Qur'an: "The Roman Empire Has been defeated – In a land close by; But they, (even) after (This) defeat of theirs, Will soon be victorious – Within a few years. With God is the Decision, In the Past And in the Future: On that Day shall The Believers rejoice” (30:2-4). By 627 C.E., the Romans had successfully defeated the Persians, resulting in much celebration by Muslims and fulfilling the prophecy of the Qur'an.
Another prophecy of the Qur'an that Muslims might argue has been fulfilled is the ease with which the book can be memorized. Because this is not a factual prophecy but based, rather, on opinion, it cannot truly be proven. However, Muslims do consider reciting or reading the Qur'an to be holy and a way to receive blessings, so it is extremely common for Muslims to memorize a large number of Qur'anic verses. The fact that this is possible and has been done by scholars and children alike, does suggest a certain quality of the Qur'an that makes it easily memorable. The Qur'an’s “rhythmic style and eloquent expression” have been cited as aids in verbatim memorization. The following verse from the Qur'an is one example of the prophecy that the Qur'an will be easily memorized by future readers: “And We have indeed Made the Qur-an easy to understand and remember: Then is there any that Will receive admonition?” (54:17) 
Another prophecy, according to the Qur'an, may have predicted the preservation of the Pharaoh of the Exodus's body. In the Qur'an, God says to the Pharaoh: "This day shall We save thee In thy body, that thou Mayest be a Sign to those Who come after thee! But verily, many among mankind Are heedless of Our Signs!" The body of the Pharaoh, who was argued to be either Ramesses II or his son Merneptah, was thought to be lost at sea until the mummies of both were discovered in the 19th century. They are on display today in Cairo's Egyptian Museum; thus, it is argued that the prophecy was fulfilled.
Countless other prophecies are claimed to have been fulfilled. Some of the predictions may seem vague and easily fulfilled by a wide variety of events, causing debate and analysis, but, regardless, many Muslims believe that the Qur'an prophesies at least some future events, though perhaps not all those listed in this article. Nevertheless, the following include some of the other potentially fulfilled claims made by the Qur'an.
The development of using fingerprints for identification of criminals: "At length, when they reach The (Fire), their hearing, Their sight, and their skins Will bear witness against them, As to (all) their deeds." (41:20) 
The problem of environmental pollution as caused by human inventions: "Mischief has appeared On land and sea because Of (the meed) that the hands Of men have earned, That (God) may give them A taste of some of their Deeds: in order that they May turn back (from Evil)" (30:41); "Then watch thou For the Day That the sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke (or mist) plainly visible, Enveloping the people: This will be a Penalty Grievous" (44:10-11).
New modes of transportation created by humans: "And (He has created) horses, Mules, and donkeys, for you To ride and use for show; And He has created (other) things Of which ye have no knowledge" (16:8).
The gradually-acquired equality for women and women's rights: "When the female (infant), Buried alive, is questioned - For what crime she was killed" (81:8-9).
