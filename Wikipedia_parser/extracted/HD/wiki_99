Tetseo Sisters

Tetseo Sisters are a quartet of four sisters from the North-Eastern state of India, Nagaland. They are devoted to the art and tradition of the vocal folk music of the state.
Life and career.
The Tetseo Sisters Mütsevelü (Mercy), Azine (Azi), Kuvelü (Kuku) and Alüne (Lulu) live in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, and belong to the Chakhesang Naga tribe, one of the major Naga tribes. They sing in Chokri, the dialect of the region around Phek. From early days, their parents acquainted the girls with "Li", the traditional songs of their home region. They first performed as a group in 1994 and have been making regular appearances since 2000 at the Hornbill festival, Nagaland's biggest annual cultural event and several other festivals and events. Growing popularity made them enlarge their radius, performing all over Nagaland, the Seven Sister States, and other Indian states. During Mercy and Azi's period of study, they made appearances as a duo in New Delhi; while Kuku and Lulu carried on in Kohima. The sisters are regularly invited to show their art on the occasion of official promotions as Nagaland's cultural ambassadors/representatives both at home and abroad. Some notable appearances include- the North East Trade Opportunities Summit in Bangkok, Thailand in 2008 and the Handshake Concerts in Bangkok in 2012 and Yangon, Myanmar in 2014; Queen Baton’s Rally for the Commonwealth Games 2010 at Touphema, Nagaland and HRH Prince Andrew’s visit to Kohima commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II on May 1, 2012.
In 2013 Tetseo Sisters were a part of the video „My vote makes my future“, with Alobo Naga and other artistes, sponsored by the Election Commission of India to promote voting for the Nagaland Assembly to younger voters.
In 2011, the Tetseos released their debut album titled "Li Chapter One : The Beginning“ at the Hornbill Festival.
Li.
The Chakhesangs have a huge repertoire of folk songs that have been compiled into a traditional songbook, "Li kukre kutiko", that consists of 223 songs. Most of the other songs have been handed down through oral tradition (much like any other Naga tribe) from generation to generation in the villages of the region. There are "Li" for special events, love songs, children's songs, laments, war songs and songs that are related to agriculture and its seasonal activities. The repetitive "Ho-he-ho“-"hiyo-hiyohey" choirs are shared between separate groups, either ad lib or echoing one another. Achieving their complexity is thus strengthening the group awareness.
The Tetseo Sisters make use of that rich treasure of handed downs songs. These songs are sometimes accompanied by the one-stringed instrument "tati" or "heka libuh" (mithun horn) which they play.
Personal life.
Mercy Tetseo earned a university degree in Psychology from the University of Delhi. Azi Vezivolü is married and is mother to a boy. She is a former "Miss Nagaland" runner up and earned a university degree in Political Sciences from the University of Delhi. She does modelling, sings in other formations and is also involved in the fashion industry with her husband.

Lowland kagu

The lowland kagu ("Rhynochetos orarius") is a large, extinct species of kagu. It was endemic to the island of New Caledonia in Melanesia in the south-west Pacific region. It was described from subfossil bones found at the Pindai Caves paleontological site on the west coast of Grande Terre. The holotype is a right tibiotarsus (NCP 700), held by the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. The specific epithet comes from the Latin "orarius" (of the coast) from its presumed lowland distribution, as opposed to its congener the living kagu "R. jubatus".
Description.
The general proportions of the various bones of the lowland kagu are very similar to those of the kagu. They differ in the greater size of the extinct species in averaging about 15% larger, with no overlap between the hindlimb elements and only rare overlap between those of the wings. The describers postulate that "R. orarius" and "R. jubatus" were lowland and highland forms, respectively.

La Guardia, Isla Margarita

La Guardia is a fishing and tourist community on the northwest coast of Isla Margarita, Venezuela.
Location.
La Guardia lies at the eastern end of a bar, or strip of land, that stretches more than from the main island of Margarita to Punta Tigre on the Macanao Peninsula, running between the Laguna de la Restinga and the Caribbean Sea.
The bar is made of rocks and pebbles of different sizes and huge numbers of sea shells.
The bar also forms the northern shore of one of the largest bays in the world.
History.
The original name was "Caranta-maura", which means "great bay" in the guaiquerí language.
Later it was called Bufadero.
The first mention of this name is in a document dated 27 September 1754, when it is mentioned as a place on the coast. 
José de Matos y Rabel was appointed Governor of Margarita on 5 July 1764 and took office on 3 January 1765.
On 21 July 1765 he mentioned in a letter to the King of Spain that he had installed two guards at the location to protect the island from smuggling,
and this is the origin of the current name. 
The name Bufadero still appears in a map of Isla Margarita dated 15 June 1777, and there are records of sales of cattle at Bufaderos in 1794 and in 1802. 
The name "La Guardia" is relatively recent. It is mentioned in a document of 24 February 1872 that Diego Romero had built three houses near the house of La Guardia in Bufadero, 
and this may be the origin of today's community. In 1899 the place was officially called Caserío (hamlet) La Guardia.
In 1915 it was renamed Zabala, but the official name is not widely used.
Activities.
Many of the people are engaged in fishing. Seafood includes mussels, oysters, octopus, mackerel and corocoro (gruntfish). 
The Virgin de María Auxiliadora is the patron saint of the town, and is celebrated on 24 May each year with processions, masses and events on the square in front of the church dedicated to the saint. On 16 July each year the fishermen observe the day of the Virgen del Carmen, carrying her image in the long procession along the length of the bay.

Pearl River Valley Water Supply District

The Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD) is a governing entity within the state of Mississippi tasked to manage a portion of the Pearl River basin, including the Ross Barnett Reservoir area, and its watersheds. The responsibilities of the district include: overseeing land management, maintaining natural resources, and providing recreational opportunities.
History.
In 1956 the Pearl River Industrial Commission was authorized by the Mississippi State Legislature to study the feasibility of development along the Pearl River basin near Jackson, Mississippi, primarily the creation of a reservoir through the construction of a spillway and dam. A hearing on the proposed development was heard by the State Board of Water Commissioners, as well as the Boards of Supervisors within the proposed district, and found that the project was a public necessity to compensate for the increasing demand for potable water (PEER report #471, 2004, page 3). As a result of that finding, the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD) was created in 1958 to oversee construction and future management of the Pearl River Reservoir (later named the Ross Barnett Reservoir), its watersheds, and surrounding land. The reservoir project was completed 1965 following the construction of an impoundment of the Pearl River bordering Rankin and Madison counties. The funding for the reservoir's construction was secured through bonds, which were to be paid off, in part, by taxes collected from municipalities within the newly formed district, as well as the city of Jackson, which would be drawing drinking water from the reservoir. The construction bonds were paid-off in 1992, and, since that time, the district no longer collects taxes, rather relying primarily on annual lease fees from residential and commercial properties within the district for funding.
Governance.
The PRVWSD is tasked to govern a 45 mile-long water basin comprising the Ross Barnett Reservoir and portions of the Pearl River, as well as land within one-quarter mile from the shoreline. Counties with land in the district are Hinds, Leake, Madison, Rankin, and Scott. The district operates on a committee system, and is primarily funded through commercial and residential property leasing fees. Responsibilities of the district include:
Organization.
The district is governed by a 14 member board as follows.
Water supply and quality.
The Ross Barnett Reservoir was created largely to compensate for the growing demand for drinking water in the area. The PRVWSD is tasked to maintain the environmental quality of the water supply as one aspect of their management program. Water quality tests are conducted frequently, as well as surveys of silting in the upper reservoir.
The PRVWSD also monitors and manages the distribution of invasive aquatic plants (macrophytes) in the reservoir. A five-year survey commissioned by the district, and headed by the Water Resources branch of Mississippi State University, studied the environmental impact of invasive plants in the reservoir. The survey identified fourteen invasive aquatic plants, Alligator weed being the most prevalent. The PRVWSD utilizes a number of methods to control the spread of invasive plants, including public education programs and the spraying of EPA approved herbicides.
City of Jackson.
The Ross Barnett Reservoir serves as the primary source of drinking-water for Mississippi's nearby capital city, Jackson. A 1982 lawsuit was brought against the district by the city, successfully claiming that PRVWSD misappropriated tax collections from the city for purposes other than paying off the original reservoir construction bonds, including the funding of a district law enforcement agency. The bonds were paid off in 1992, and the district no longer collects taxes from the city.
Dam and spillway.
The PRVWSD maintains a ten-gate spillway to control the lake level and discharge into the lower river. The steel gates are forty feet wide and twenty feet tall. The spillway is monitored 24-hours via a computer system and surveillance cameras located in the control tower situated on top of the dam. Computer software developed by the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of Engineers assist spillway operators in maintaining the correct discharge amount. The maximum output of the spillway is 170,000 cubic feet per second. The minimum discharge is 240 cubic feet per second.
Flood control.
One aspect of the PRVWSD's management program is to mitigate flood events in the district, the upper river, and downstream.
Following the 1979 Easter flood, which left much of greater Jackson underwater, a report by the United States Comptroller's office found that the impact of the flood was due largely to a lack of communication between agencies. Since that time the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of Engineers, the City of Jackson, and the PRVWSD- as well as other involved agencies- have cooperated to develop an action plan in the event of another flood. There have also been numerous, highly debated, proposals over the years for additional flood control measures, both upstream and below the dam, but specific projects have yet to be approved.
Law enforcement.
The PRVWSD operates a law enforcement agency within the district. The Reservoir Police patrol roadways, waterways, and commercial and residential areas within the district. They cooperate closely with other law enforcement agencies of the surrounding municipalities, and are fully authorized by the State of Mississippi to operate as a branch of law enforcement.
Leasing and land management.
The district leases shoreline property for commercial and residential development, and relies on lease fees to provide the majority of district funding. According to the PRVWSD website, approximately 5,300 leases are in currently place.
Recreation.
PRVWSD manages 22 boat launches, 16 parks, 5 campgrounds, 3 handicapped accessible trails, and 2 multipurpose trails. Recreation areas are used by an estimated 2.5 million visitors each year.

Cornélie Huygens

Cornélie Lydie Huygens (13 June 1848, Haarlemmerliede - 31 October 1902, Amsterdam) was a Dutch writer, social democrat and feminist.
She was the daughter of Gerard William Otto Huygens and Cornelia Adelaide Henriette Elias (1824-1848) and married the German businessman Ignatius Bernardus Maria Bahlmann (1852-1934) in 1902. Her mother died after her birth and she was raised by her paternal aunt Jeanne Marie Huygens, a friend of the feminist Mina Kruseman. Huygens became early known for her feminist articles and made her debut as a novelist in 1877. In 1896, she joined the newly founded Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) as its first female member and the first woman in the Netherlands to be a member of a political party, and she became known as the "Red Lady". Cornélie Huygens was a known and active socialist ideologist and participator in the political debate, and by her work for women suffrage, she made the work for women's rights, which had in the Netherlands had previously been an issue for upper class women, a part of the socialist movement for worker's rights.
Despite her principled opposition against the institute of marriage, she married on 2 October 1902, at the age of 54, to the Amsterdam-born German businessman Ignazius Bahlmann, who had translated her novel "Barthold Meryan" into German. Apparently very unhappy in her marriage, she drowned herself within a month after this wedding in a pond in the Vondelpark.

Privately owned public space

A privately owned public space is a public space that is open to the public, but owned by a private entity, typically a commercial property developer. Conversion of publicly owned public spaces to privately owned public spaces is referred to as the privatization of public space, and is a common result of urban redevelopment.
Beginning roughly in the 1960s, the wholesale privatization of public space (especially in urban centers) has become a fact of western society, and has faced criticism from citizen groups such as the Open Spaces Society. Private-public partnerships have taken significant control of public parks and playgrounds through conservancy groups set up to manage what is considered unmanageable by public agencies. Corporate sponsorship of public leisure areas is ubiquitous, giving open space to the public in exchange for higher air rights. This facilitates the construction of taller buildings with private parks.
In one of the newer U.S. incarnations of the private-public partnership, the business improvement district (BID), private organizations are allowed to tax local businesses and retail establishments so that they might provide special private services such as policing and increased surveillance, trash removal, or street renovation, all of which once fell under the control of public funds.
Privately owned public spaces in New York City were introduced as a formal concept in a 1961 zoning resolution. The city offers zoning concessions to commercial and residential developers in exchange for a variety of spaces accessible and usable for the public.
Unlike NYC parks which have a 1 am curfew, many POPS parks are required to be open 24-hours per day. For this reason the Zuccotti Park POPS was selected by the Occupy Wall Street movement during their 2011 protests.
POPOS.
In San Francisco and Seattle they are known as Privately Owned Public Open Spaces (POPOS).

North Korea at the Paralympics

North Korea made its Paralympic Games début at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, sending a single wildcard representative (Rim Ju Song, a left arm and left leg amputee) to compete in swimming.
Context.
While South Korea has been taking part in the Paralympics since 1968, the North long ignored the Games. In the early 21st century, it was reported that persons with disabilities in North Korea (with the exception of veterans) were locked away in camps, and "subjected to harsh and sub-human conditions". Vitit Muntarbhorn, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights, reported in 2006 that North Koreans with disabilities were excluded from the country's showcase capital, Pyongyang, and kept in camps where they were categorised by disability. Defectors reported the existence of "collective camps for midgets", whose inmates were forbidden from having children. However the charity Handicap International reports that it has been operating in North Korea since 1999 assisting the Korean Federation for the Protection of Disabled People, and the International Committee of the Red Cross reported in 2006 that it had assisted in setting up a rehabilitation centre for disabled people in Pyongyang.
By 2008, the United Nations reported that the government was "beginning to consider welfare for the disabled". Yahoo news reported in 2012 that a Paralympic cultural centre exists in Pyongyang.
2012 debut.
North Korea obtained provisional membership of the International Paralympic Committee in March 2012, entitling the country to take part in the Games. It reportedly aimed to field athletes in track and field, swimming and table tennis in particular. "Twelve athletes, coaches, and officials from the North Korean Paralympic team" received training in Beijing prior to the Games.
Ultimately, however, it was announced that the country's delegation would consist in a single athlete, Rim Ju Song, who would compete in the men's freestyle swimming (S6 disability category) and breaststroke (SB5). Rim had "lost his left arm and left leg, and suffered significant injuries to his right leg and foot in an accident on a construction site when he was five years old". The British Embassy in Pyongyang provided assistance, including financial support, to enable him to obtain training and participate in the Games. He received a wildcard invitation to the Paralympics.
Rim swam in heat 2, which he completed in 47.87 seconds, 17.89 seconds behind heat winner Lorenzo Perez (from Cuba). Rim's time was the slowest of all nineteen swimmers in the first round, 10.68 seconds behind second-last Reagan Wickens (Australia).

Gregoire Boonzaier

Gregoire Johannes Boonzaier (31 July 1909 Newlands, Cape Town - 22 April 2005 Onrus, near Hermanus) was a versatile and prolific South African painter of landscapes, portraits, still lifes, seascapes and figures in oil, watercolour, ink, wash, pencil and charcoal, and a large number of linocuts.
Biography.
Gregoire Boonzaier was the fifth child of political cartoonist Daniël Cornelis Boonzaier and his cousin Maria Elizabeth Boonzaier. Early on Gregoire made the acquaintance of the artists Pieter Wenning, Nita Spilhaus, Moses Kottler and Anton Van Wouw, all of whom were close family friends.
It was Moses Kottler who first gave Gregoire a box of paints in 1922 and Nita Spilhaus an easel in 1926, igniting a creative flame that was to burn for more than eighty years. Gregoire's father was dead set against a formal training in art and felt that he had more to learn from the artists around him. In 1923 his first two oil paintings were shown at Ashbey’s Gallery in Cape Town, simply signed "GREGOIRE". His first one-man exhibition followed two years later - he was to hold more than 100 one-man exhibitions during his painting career. 
After an acrimonious confrontation with his father in 1932, Gregoire moved into his own studio in Cape Town and after a successful exhibition visited England in 1934 where he was a student together with Terence McCaw and Frieda Lock at the Heatherley School of Fine Art under Bernard Adams, and training in graphic art techniques at the Central School of Art and Design in London. His early paintings having been strongly influenced by Pieter Wenning, he now absorbed the work of Van Gogh, Cézanne, Utrillo and Braque, and made trips as far afield as Russia, where his socialist leanings are reinforced. He returned three years later to help found the New Group, with Terence McCaw, Frieda Lock, Lippy Lipshitz and others, and served as its first chairman for ten years. The New Group served as a forum and mouthpiece of young South African art for almost 15 years, staging exhibitions throughout the country, and providing rural areas with a glimpse of the new trends in art. He served for six years on the Board of the South African National Gallery, Cape Town. 
Boonzaier made Cape Town his base and his subsequent work reflected views of District Six and the Malay Quarter, recording its colourful life. He settled at Onrusrivier, a short distance outside Hermanus. He had been introduced to Onrus shortly after World War II by Uys Krige whose family had holidayed there for ages.
He took part with 43 SA artists, in the "Exhibition of South African Art" at the Tate Gallery in London in 1948. His numerous prizes and awards included the silver Order for Meritorious Service presented by Nelson Mandela in 1999. His work is to be found in private and corporate collections throughout the world.
In 2003 his sons Anton and Emile, together with the family accountant Sybrand Smit, took over the financial side of his art studio. In the same year Marie, Boonzaier's partner of some 60 years, succumbed to a stroke. In November 2004 Boonzaier completed some works, and tidied his studio for the last time. In February 2005 he took to bed on a hunger strike, waiting for death, which came at 10:15 p.m. on 22 April.

Skafferhullet

Skafferhullet is a historical border crossing point along the Norway–Russia border (formerly it was on the Finland–Norway border and Soviet–Norway border). The border crossing site was located on the old road between Elvenes in Sør-Varanger Municipality, Finnmark county, Norway and Borisoglebsky in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. The station lies on the western shore of the Pasvikelva river. 
Since this site is now closed, the only other border crossing from Norway into Russia is at the nearby border crossing at Storskog on the newer European route E105 highway. 
History.
During the Cold War the Soviet–Norway border was closed for long periods. There was some traffic via Skafferhullet during the construction of the Boris Gleb hydroelectric station from 1958 to 1963. When the construction period was over, the guardhouses were removed, and a solid fence set up.
In the summer of 1965, the border was open for Scandinavian tourists, who were allowed to visit a heavily guarded area around Borisoglebsky. Several thousand Norwegians crossed into during that summer season to visit, but no Soviets crossed into Norway. Due to some issues (like alcohol smuggling) that summer, Norwegian authorities refused to participate again, so the border was kept closed in 1966 and the following years.

2012–13 EIHL season

The 2012–13 Elite Ice Hockey League Season was the tenth season of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The regular season began on Saturday 8 September 2012 and ended on Sunday 24 March 2013, followed by the Play-Offs which culminated in the end-of-season Play-Off Finals on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 April 2013.
This season saw the introduction of a new two conference format, in which the ten participating teams were split into two conferences of five teams. The Gardiner Conference, named after former Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Charlie Gardiner, comprised the five northernmost mainland teams (Braehead Clan, Dundee Stars, Edinburgh Capitals, Fife Flyers and Hull Stingrays) and the Erhardt Conference, named after the captain of the British 1936 Winter Olympics gold medal winning team Carl Erhardt, comprised the four southernmost mainland teams (Cardiff Devils, Coventry Blaze, Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers) and one team from Northern Ireland (Belfast Giants). The most prestigious honour remained the overall League Championship, awarded to the team with the most points gained from all league games (conference and inter-conference games). The season also included the end-of-season Play-Offs and the Challenge Cup.
Nottingham Panthers proved to be the dominant team of the season, clinching the Elite League Championship - their first British League Championship title for 57 years - when they defeated their nearest challengers Belfast Giants 5-3 at the Odyssey Arena on Friday 15 March 2013. However, the Giants would prevent the Panthers achieving a regular season double of League and Conference titles by shading a very close Erhardt Conference title race on regulation time wins after both teams finished level on points. The Gardiner Conference proved even more exciting with all five teams never being more than a few wins apart, at one stage towards the end of the season only one point separating first and last place. Braehead Clan eventually ran out Conference Champions in a very successful first season for the new two-conference format.
The Challenge Cup was won for the fourth successive season by Nottingham Panthers, clinching their second honour of the season by defeating Sheffield Steelers 5-3 on aggregate in the two-legged final. The Panthers then overcame a big scare at the hands of Fife Flyers in the Play-Off Quarter-Finals to defeat Cardiff Devils in the Semi-Finals and then Belfast Giants 3-2 in overtime in the Final. This third successive Play-Offs victory also gave them the treble of League Championship, Play-Offs and Challenge Cup, the first time the treble has been won since Coventry Blaze's success in 2004-05.
Regular Season.
The League Championship was played for over 52 games, each team playing teams in their own conference eight times (four home and four away) and teams in the other conference four times (two home and two away).
The Conference Championships were played for over 32 games, each team playing teams in their own conference eight times (four home and four away).
Teams were awarded two points for a win (in regulation time, overtime or shoot-out), one point for a tie (in regulation time but loss in overtime or shoot-out) and no points for a loss (in regulation time). Teams level on points were separated by (1) total number of games won in regulation time, (2) total number of all games won, (3) results between teams or (4) fewest losses.
The top eight teams in the League Championship qualified for the Play-Offs.

Daikaijū Monogatari

In this clone of Dragon Quest, there are a series of natural disasters that are devastating the planet; causing the great Demon King Fattobajah to emerge from his elemental shell-induced slumber. A hero who carries a fire shell must save the world from a series of truly bad events. Up to ten playable characters can be used as allies in order to stop villains like Dr. Doan, Jalamar, Jodan, and Darkness Knight. The people who inhabit the land of Shelldorado are very smart despite looking like savage monsters.
There is a high level of random encounters in the game. Complex dungeon design can also be found in Daikaijū Monogatari that is on par for the course for Japanese role-playing video games. While the main character and his allies factor into the storyline of the game, parts of the game seem to flow from the enemy's perspective more often.
When the player pauses the game, it normally leads to a series of eight options. Three more can be opened by virtue of a Pro Action Replay.

Johan C. Schwarz-Nielsen

Johan Christoffer Schwarz-Nielsen (April 19, 1924 – November 7, 1987) was a vicar in Bistrup Parish, Bistrup Sogn, North of Copenhagen from the creation of the parish in 1963 until his death in 1987. 
Life.
A ban on building of public buildings (caused by shortage of labour) came into effect in 1962, which meant that the planned building of Bistrup Church had to be postponed. Schwarz-Nielsen gathered a group of volunteers from the parish, 120 in total, so they could build the church themselves, an approach that not attempted in Denmark for some 800 years. Originally they were only aiming at building part of the ground floor of the church, which was completed in 1963, but as they were proceeding well they continued for another four years with the main part containing the church room proper and the 21 meters tall tower. Subsequently, Johan took the initiative for helping to build several buildings, including the 'Henrik Gerners Børnehaven' kindergarten between 1970 and 1973; 'Gerner Salen', an annex to the church between 1978 and 1979; and the 'Marie Gerner Gården' creche from 1979 to 1981. All these projects were organised as independent non-profit organisations and the necessary funds were mainly collected in the parish for these specific purposes. In 1982 Johan went to Cyprus as Army Chaplain with the peacekeeping Danish DANCON UN-contingent, a natural continuation of his service in Akademisk Skytteforening, O-gruppe 2, during the Occupation of Denmark 1940–1945.
Family.
Johan married Bente (née Blichmann) in 1949. They would have three sons.
Charitable Work.
Johan was involved in a range of charitable work at local and national level. He was from 1982 and, through to his death, Chairman of Børnehjælpsdagen, a country-wide charity for children. Between 1968 and 1969 he was Chairman of the Board for Lions Club Denmark, and he was Chairman of Lion club's Catastrophe and Emergency Foundation from 1983 until his death.

Zag de Sujurmenza

Rabbi Sujurmenza Zag was a Jewish convert of 13th-century Spain who helped King Alfonso X of Castile with his scientific works.
Zag de Sujurmenza was commissioned by the king to write "Astrolabio redondo" (spherical astrolabe), "Astrolabio llano" (flat astrolabe), Constelaciones (constellations) and "Lámina Universal" (an instrument that improved on the astrolabe); he also translated the book "Armellas de Ptolemy", and wrote about the "Piedra de la sombra" (stone of the shadow, or sundial), "Relox de agua" (clepsydra, or water clock) "Argente vivo o azogue" (quicksilver or mercury) and "Candela" (candle clock). Of his works, the most important are those of the "round astrolabe" and the "flat astrolabe". In the first, the author rises to profound scientific considerations that reveal the vast knowledge he possessed in sciences. It has been said that with this book, Zag Sujurmenza reformed the character of the science of astronomy and contributed to its advancement, without losing sight of the studies of Arab scholars, following in their footsteps and correcting their errors. Other works of Zag de Sujurmenza, if less extensive, are not without merit.

Gisela Agnes of Rath

Gisela Agnes of Rath (9 October 1669 in Kleinwülknitz, now part of Köthen – 12 March 1740 in Nienburg) was Duchess of Anhalt-Köthen by marriage from 1692. In 1694, she was created Countess of Nienburg. From 1704 to 1715, she was regent of Anhalt-Köthen for her underage son.
Life.
Gisela Agnes was a member of an ancient aristocratic Lutheran family. Her parents were Balthasar William of Rath, Baron of Kleinwülknitz, and Magdalene Dorothee of Wuthenau. Her paternal grandfather was Wilhelm von Rath; he had commanded the army of Prince Louis I of Anhalf-Köthen during the Thirty Years' War.
The heir to the throne, the young Prince Emmanuel Lebrecht of Anhalt-Köthen fell in love with her. His mother, Princess Eleonore, tried to end this relationship, because Gisela Agnes was considered lower nobility, and unsuitable to marry a ruling Prince. She sent Gisela Agnes to her sister in Stadthagen. However, immediately after Emmanuel Lebrecht had assumed government, he "quietly" married her, on 30 September 1692.
This was a morganatic marriage. Moreover, Prince Emmanuel Lebrecht was a Calvinist and Gisela Agnes was Lutheran. The marriage sparked vehement protest from both the Reformed church and the princely family. Nevertheless, children from this marriage were officially recognized as potential heirs to the throne by the Princes of Anhalt in 1698 and by the emperor in 1699. The later Dukes of Anhalt-Köthen all descend from the "unequal" marriage.
Regency.
During his lifetime, her husband had arranged that after his death, she would act as regent for their son Leopold. So when he died in 1704, she took up the regency.
She supported the Lutherans in the principality and founded the St. Agnus church, the first Lutheran church in Köthen. A large portrait of her by Antoine Pesne is still on display in the church. Only a few years later, Johann Sebastian Bach would become a member of this congregation. In 1711, she founded the "Gisela Agnes Stift", a secular convent for single noble ladies.
In 1714, a court orchestra was founded, formally by her, but financed by her son Leopold. Initially, the orchestra was composed mainly of former members of the court orchestra in Berlin, which had been dissolved the previous year. The first conductor was the opera composer Augustin Reinhard Stricker. In 1717, he was replaced by Johann Sebastian Bach.
In 1694, Emperor Leopold I elevated Gisela Agnes to "Countess of Nienburg". In 1699, Emmanuel Lebrecht gave her the castle, city and district of Nienburg as a personal possession for life. When the regency ended in 1715, Gisela Agnes withdrew to Nienburg, where she continued to support Lutheranism. She became friends with the theologian and poet August Hermann Francke, who even visited her on her widow seat.
On 24 January 1716, her daughter Eleonore Wilhelmine married in Niehburg to Duke Ernest Augustus I of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. It is widely believed that her son Leopold first met the composer Bach during the wedding celebrations.
Gisela Agnes died in Nienburg on 12 March 1740 and was buried in the princely crypt in the St. Jacob church in Köthen.
Issue.
Gisela Agnes and Emmanuel Lebrecht had six children:

Special Advocate

A Special Advocate is a lawyer, usually a barrister or advocate, sometimes a solicitor, who is appointed to represent the interests of a party in closed proceedings, i.e. proceedings from which that party has been excluded. Special advocates are generally prohibited from discussing any evidence that has been the subject of closed proceedings with the excluded party. They are most often used in the context of cases involving national security but have also been used in other matters, including parole board hearings and data protection claims.
Canada.
In Canada Special advocates are lawyers independent of government and appointed by the Court to protect the interests of persons named in security certificates during the hearings from which persons named in certificates and their own lawyers are excluded. Special advocates are not, however, in a solicitor-client relationship with the person named in the certificate. Special advocates have the required government security clearance for accessing information which the government must keep confidential because its disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger a person's safety. Special advocates will be under strict obligations to maintain the confidentiality of that information.
On February 23, 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Charkaoui that the security certificate provisions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act were unconstitutional because the process violated the rights of persons named in a certificate to a fair hearing. The Supreme Court of Canada suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year to give Parliament time to amend the security certificate legislation. The Government responded to Charkaoui with Bill C-3. This legislation adds a special advocate regime to security certificate and related proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It attempts to strike a balance between protecting the rights of persons named in a certificate and ensuring the confidentiality of information which, if disclosed, would be injurious to national security or endanger a person's safety.

Kolob Creek Dam

Kolob Creek Dam (National ID # UT00164) is a dam in Washington County, Utah.
The earthen dam was constructed in 1956 by the Hurricane Canal Company and Washington Fields 
Canal Company, with a height of 67 feet, and a length of 686 feet at its crest. It impounds Kolob Creek for flood control and irrigation water storage. The dam is now owned and operated by the local Washington County Water Conservation District.
The reservoir it creates, Kolob Reservoir, has a water surface of 249 acres, and a maximum capacity of 6914 acre-feet. Recreation is limited. In the winter the reservoir is only accessible by snow mobile. The reservoir is surrounded by private land, so camping is only allowed near the lake, and fences mark the start of private land on almost all shores of the reservoir. Fishing is allowed under special regulations. 
Through the 2000s the Conservation District continued to develop the reservoir's size and recreational facilities. Technical climbers in the rugged, downstream slot canyon along Kolob Creek in Zion National Park are advised to contact the Conservation District for its water release schedule from the dam, because water releases can pose a deadly risk.

Captain Jan

Captain Jan () is a 1940 novel by Dutch writer Jan de Hartog.
The book depicts highly skilled tugboat sailors as modern successors to the bold navigators of the Dutch Golden Age. 
The book was published in 1940, just ten days before Nazi Germany invaded and swiftly occupied the hitherto-neutral Netherlands. Under these circumstances, a book with such a name and theme became an immediate best seller in occupied Holland, a potent symbol of Dutch opposition to the occupation.
In fact, the book's plot as such had nothing political, anti-German or anti-Nazi, the sailor protagonists' conflict being mainly with nature and with the paternalistic and authoritarian Kwel Shipping Company which demands feudal-like fealty from its employees. This did not stop the Gestapo from showing a lively interest in its author, forcing him to go into hiding and then escape to England in 1943.

José R. Oliva (born January 6, 1973) is a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 110th District, which includes Hialeah and Miami Lakes in northern Miami-Dade County, since 2011.
History.
Oliva was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and moved to the state of Florida in 1974. He graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, and later attended St. Thomas University, but did not graduate. Oliva began working for his family's cigar manufacturing business, and eventually served as its Chief Executive Officer. From 2001 to 2005, he served as a Hialeah Housing Commissioner.
Florida House of Representatives.
When incumbent State Representative Esteban Bovo resigned from the legislature to successfully run for the Miami-Dade County Commission in 2011, a special election was called to replace him. Oliva ran in the Republican primary against Frank Lago and Rafael Luiz Perez, emphasizing his support for "lower taxes, small and accountable government, conservative family values." He ended up winning the primary, receiving 42% of the vote to Lago's 35% and Perez's 23%, and advanced to the general election, where he only faced write-in opposition. Oliva won the general election handily, winning 93% of the vote.
In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the legislative districts, Oliva remained in the 110th District, which retained most of the territory that he had previously represented. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Ileana Abay, but he dispatched her easily, winning renomination with 86% of the vote. In the general election, he once again only faced write-in opposition, and he won his second term with nearly 100% of the vote.
Following his re-election, Oliva received enough votes from his colleagues in the legislature to assume the position of Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2008-2010 legislative session, assuming that he continues to win re-election.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 238

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 238 (P. Oxy. 238 or P. Oxy. II 238) is a notice issued by an official, probably the strategos, written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. It is dated between 29 August and 27 September 72. Currently it is housed in the Trinity College Library in Dublin.
Description.
The notice orders all people who had deposited business documents which were still "meteoroi" (μετέωροι) to appear before the agoranomi and complete the documents. The meaning of the word "μετέωροι" is obscure as applied to contracts but it seems to mean "incompleted." This manuscript sheds some light on the organization of repositories of public records in Oxyrhynchus as opposed to in Faiyum. The handwriting is a large, clear semi-uncial script. The measurements of the fragment are 194 by 96 mm.
It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899.

Lamezia Terme Town Library

The Lamezia Terme Town Library is located in the historic centre of the former village of Nicastro and more precisely in the Nicotera-Severisio historical building located in the Tommaso Campanella square.
The town library belongs to the Territorial Library System of Lamezia Terme which also includes other 17 towns libraries of as many towns of the Lamezia Terme area.
History.
The library was founded in 1897 by collecting all book funds taken from the Dominican and Capuchin convents in Nicastro which added to modern books and a dedicated collection of books about Calabria and Lamezia Terme itself, reaches a numer of 25000 of volumes.
Services and reading rooms.
The library has three main rooms:
It is possible to ask to the library staff any information regarding the book collection and also to ask for a guided tour of the historical building that currently hosts the library, which is the old house of a famous noble family of the former village of Nicastro.
Casa del Libro Antico "(House of the Ancient Book)".
The "Casa del Libro Antico" "(the House of the Ancient Book)" is the historical and specialised section of the town library. It was founded in 2002 to take care of the historical book funds belonging to the Capuchin and Domenican convents of Nicastro which were confiscated in 1866 because of the suppression of the religious orders. All those books are an invaluable evidence of how important a book was especially for the domenican friars who strictly respected and kept all the books they had, being those very expensive for either clergyman or lay readers.
Collection.
The collection includes mainly printed books about theology, philosophy, patrology, ecclesiastical history and exegesis, homiletics, hagiography, all dated from the 11th to the 19th century, among which it is worth mentioning some with annotations from Tommaso Campanella who studied Aristotelian logic in the village of Nicastro (now Lamezia Terme) between the years 1585 and 1587. There are in fact more than thirty books from the 16th century which are all about the Aristotelian Philosophy and its classic commentators such as Averroes, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Theodorus Gaza, Saint Thomas, averroistic books by Agostino Nifo and Marcantonio Zimara and Crisostomo Iavelli, mentioned by Tommaso Campanella himself in his "Philosophia sensibus demonstrata" and interesting it is that some of those books contain also annotations from original authors.
In addition to the printed books, the collection includes also some manuscripts and fragments of manuscripts, of Greek and Latin illuminated codices so that the amount of total books reaches more than 2,500 volumes, all dated from the 16th to the 19th century and some of them printed in various Italian and European old centres of excellence of the art of thypography, such as the presses of Aldus Manutius, Lucantonio Giunta, Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, Froben and Plantin. 
There also store several books by Thomas Aquinas, such as "Summa Theologica", the "aristotelian" books in different editions and other books with his comments such as the "Epistles" by Saint Paul (Paris, 1541), where two long annotations can be found regarding a topic also debated and examined in depth by Tommaso Campanella: the absence of sin in Christ and the Virgin Mary's immunity from the original sin.
In order to give evidence of the importance that the singing had during the religious service for the Dominicans, the collection exhibits some liturgical books from the 18th century with an attractive red and black printing of the lyrics and accompaniment. It is worth mentioning that only one of these books is previous to the Council of Trent, which is the "Repertorium morale" by Berchorius (Lyon, 1520) where it is also possible to find an annotation from a certain Tommaso from Squillace (i.e. Tommaso Campanella) and where all pages are marked at the top with a specific annotation about the sacred writer discussed in there, which was probably a necessary thing to do for a quick reference or to memorize in a more visual way the content of the book because of the gothic characters used for the printing which were quite difficult to read.
In addition to the book collection there are also a completely restored celestial globe dated back to 1695 plus a not restored terrestrial one dated back to 1744. The first one was produced in Rome by the "Calchographia Dominici de Rubeis" in 1695 with an illustration of the vault of heaven based on the osservations of Tycho Brahe whereas the second, with the illustrations of seas and lands, was produced yet in Rome but by the "Calcografia della Reverenda Camera Apostolica" in 1744. The two globes had been mentioned by Vito Capialbi (a famous Italian archeologist of the 19th century) in his report about calabrian libraries as kept in the collection of another Dominican friary of Soriano Calabro and from Tommaso Campanella in his The City of the Sun. There are also shown some very high quality reproductions of the Fra Mauro world map (the original is the Biblioteca Marciana library in Venice and where south is shown at the top and north at the bottom of the map), of the Codex Rossanensis (the original is in the diocean museum of Rossano) and of the Tabula Peutingeriana.
The following ones are some of ancient books included in the collection:
Prohibited Publications.
The collection includes also books of a very high historical value as they prove the laws that ruled what was legitimate or not to read as well as the ongoing probihitions during the past centuries. Those rules might be the reason why three very different books stored in the library of Lamezia have been binded together, those are the "Lapsi, Punitim ac Reparati Orbis Catastrophe. Poema Sacrum" printed in Naples in 1666 and dedicated to Ioanni Caramueli(a Campanian bishop also author of some comments to this poem), a mystical essay by Pope Innocent III published in 1534 in the Protestant city of Leipzig (therefore unpopular) and a folk tale related to the Dominican friary of Soriano Calabro published in Messina in 1696. The cautios illuminator who put together these books in fact, hid them using the title "Poema Sacrum de Contemptu mundi". There are other prohibited books included in the old Dominican collection are for instance the "Bibliotecha Interpretum" (1638) by Xantes Mariales, books by Zacharia Pasqualigi and three different editions of the "Ecclesiastical History" by Alessandro Natale (he became a prohibited author as he defended the doctrine of the "Gallican Church"), a Venetian one of 1732 by Amat the Graveson, a parisian one of 1740 and a napolitean one of 1740 by Roncaglia. Because of the ecclesiastical censorship, the books printed during the 16th century in the cities of Basel, Frankfurt and other suspicious places (even if they were born places for saints or Doctors of the Church, had been inked in order to cover all of a portion of a text classified as prohibited, which is what happened to the six big volumes of the "Theatrum Humanae Vitae" (Basel, 1586-87) by Theodor Zwinger stored in Lamezia though thanks to this expedient, the books weren't destroyed and survived up to now. There is also a vocabulary from Greek to Latin included in the collection and printed in Basel in 1524 that has been inked for all the occurrences of the word "Basel". Same destiny applied to the "Metamorphoses" by Ovid, of which the Venetian version of 1536 has been ruined by the censorship ink for entire pages.

History.
Trujillo was born on Long Island in New York and moved to the state of Florida in 1988. He attended Spring Hill College, graduating with a degree in business administration in 2004, and then the Florida State University College of Law, receiving his Juris Doctor in 2007. Following graduation, he served as an assistant state attorney for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, primarily dealing with felony prosecutions. He then started his own legal practice, Trujillo Vargas LLC.
Florida House of Representatives.
When incumbent State Representative Marcelo Llorente was unable to seek re-election in 2010 due to term limits, Trujillo ran to succeed him in the 116th District, which included The Hammocks and Kendale Lakes, suburbs of Miami in central Miami-Dade County. He faced former State Representative Carlos A. Manrique, Francisco Amador, and Whilly Bermudez in the Republican primary, and he emerged narrowly victorious with 34% of the vote. Trujillo advanced to the general election, where he encountered only write-in opposition, winning with 97% of the vote.
In 2012, following the reconfiguration of state legislative districts, Trujillo ran for re-election in the 105th District, which contained territory that was radically different from what he had previously represented in the 116th District. Trujillo kept some of the precincts that he had represented in the Miami suburbs, and expanded to include vast amounts of rural Collier County and Miami-Dade County, stretching from Doral to Naples. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Paul Crespo, who presented a serious challenge. Trujillo racked up the endorsements of former Governor Jeb Bush, Sweetwater Mayor Manuel Maroño, and the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and ended up defeating Crespo with 56% of the vote. He advanced to the general election, where he once again encountered only write-in opposition, and won his second term with nearly 100% of the vote.
While serving in the legislature, Trujillo "sponsored legislation that loosened the accrediting requirements for physical therapy assistant programs," which directly benefitted Dade Medical College, a campaign contributor of Trujillo's which was providing his sister-in-law with free tuition. When Trujillo was advocating for the legislation, which ultimately passed he argued that he did not have a conflict of interest "because the new law doesn't apply exclusively to Dade Medical--there are other schools it might benefit as well."

History.
Artiles was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1973, and moved to the state of Florida in 1975. He attended Florida State University, graduating with a degree in criminal justice and criminology in 1995. Following graduation, Artiles joined the United States Marine Corps in 1998 and served with the 4th Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company in West Palm Beach, enabling him to attend the St. Thomas University School of Law, from which he received his Juris Doctor in 2000, and the University of Miami School of Law, receiving his Master of Laws in real property development in 2001. While serving in the armed forces, Artiles was deployed to Port of Spain in April 2002 as part of Operation Weedeater, part of a drug operation with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, and to Iraq as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. During his service, Artiles received the Presidential Unit Citation, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the Selected Marine Corps Reserve Medal. 
Florida House of Representatives.
In 2002, following the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts, Artiles opted to run for the Florida House of Representatives in the 119th District, which stretched from Doral to Florida City in eastern Miami-Dade County. He faced Juan C. Zapata, Tim Hyman, and Armando Pomar in the Republican primary, and narrowly lost to Zapata, receiving 32% of the vote to Zapata's 36%, Hyman's 29%, and Pomar's 4%. Artiles ran against Zapata, who was then the incumbent, again in 2004, but lost by a wide margin, winning only 36% of the vote to Zapata's 64%. When Zapata was unable to seek re-election in 2010 due to term limits, Artiles once again ran in the 119th District, and this time, won the primary election unopposed. He advanced to the general election, where he faced Katie Edwards, the Democratic nominee, Tea Party candidate Alex Fernandez, and independent candidate Graziella Denny. Ultimately, Artiles emerged victorious, scoring 52% of the vote to Edwards's 44%.
When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Artiles was moved into the 118th District, which retained most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 119th District. He won the Republican primary unopposed, and faced only write-in opposition in the general election, resulting in a landslide victory to his second term in the legislature.
During the 2014 legislative session, Artiles sponsored legislation that made electronic cigarettes illegal for minors to use. Though the bill initially contained a prevision that Artiles hoped would result in a statewide ban on e-cigarettes, an amendment sponsored by fellow Republican State Representative Bill Hager stripped the provision from the bill that "would have prevented local governments from creating their own rules on e-cigarettes and tobacco products." Following a unanimous vote in support of the bill, Artiles remarked, "At the end of the day, the state of Florida has acted before the federal government in protecting our children from contaminating their lungs with vaporizing devices and e-cigarettes." Additionally, Artiles worked with State Senator Jeff Brandes to author legislation that would have repealed the right-light camera law in the state, arguing that the cameras were not needed to improve safety. He declared, "We currently have the tools in our toolbox to stop the red-light infractions from occurring, we do not need the red light cameras today in Florida."

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 239

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 239 (P. Oxy. 239 or P. Oxy. II 239) is a declaration on oath addressed to the "scribe of the Oxyrhynchite nome," written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. It is dated 19 September 66. Currently it is housed in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Description.
The document is a declaration on oath by Epimachus stating that he had not raised any irregular contributions (λογεία) in the village of Psôbthis and that he would not do so in the future. The word "λογεία" refers to local contributions as opposed to regular taxes. The measurements of the fragment are 157 by 98 mm.
It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899.
Text.
To the scribe of the Oxyrhynchite nome from Epimachus, son of Pausiris, son of Ptolemaeus, whose mother is Heraclea, daughter of Epimachus, an inhabitant of the village of Psôbthis in the lower toparchy. I swear by Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator that I have levied no contributions for any purpose whatever in the said village and that henceforward I shall not become headman of a village; otherwise let me be liable to the consequences of the oath.

Fred Costello

Fredrick W. "Fred" Costello (born February 9, 1950) is a Republican politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 26th District, which included southern Flagler County and northern Volusia County, stretching from Ormond Beach to Deltona, from 2010 to 2012.
History.
Costello was born in Orlando, and attended Graceland University, from which he graduated in 1970. He then attended the University of Iowa, receiving his Doctor of Dental Surgery in 1974. After graduation, Costello joined the United States Air Force, from 1974 to 1977, serving as a Captain, and then returned to Florida in 1977, settling in Ormond Beach and practicing dental medicine. He was elected to the Ormond Beach City Commission, where he served from 1999 to 2002, and then was elected Mayor, serving from 2002 to 2010.
Florida House of Representatives.
In 2010, following the inability of State Representative Pat Patterson to seek re-election, Costello ran to succeed him in the 26th District, which included southern Flagler County and northern Volusia County, stretching from Ormond Beach to Deltona. He faced Nathan McDonnell and Vince Champion in the Republican primary, whom he was able to handily defeat, receiving 50% of the vote to McDonnell's 28% and Champion's 23%. Advancing to the general election, Costello campaigned on "creating jobs for Floridians in renewable-energy research development and manufacturing," and was opposed by Tim Huth, the Democratic nominee and the former Deputy Superintendent of Volusia County Schools. Costello dispatched Huth with ease to win his first term in the legislature, scoring 60% of the vote to Huth's 40%.
2012 congressional campaign.
When the state's congressional districts were redrawn in 2012, Costello opted to run in the newly-created 6th District, which stretched along the east coast of the state, including Flagler County, southern Putnam County, St. Johns County, and northern Volusia County. He faced former federal prosecutor Ron DeSantis, restaurant executive Craig Miller, St. Johns County School Board member Beverly Slough, Jacksonville City Councilman Richard Clark, William Billy Kogut, and Alec Pueschel in the Republican primary. Costello campaigned on his support for "individual and 'states rights'" and clashed with DeSantis, who attacked Costello in mail advertisements and television advertisements as a "tax and spend" liberal who voted in the legislature to give undocumented immigrants in-state tuition, for spending increases, and for an internet sales tax. Costello strongly condemned DeSantis's charges, declaring, "While DeSantis continues to call me a career politician...he travels around campaigning and aligning himself with Washington insiders." Ultimately, Costello placed second to DeSantis, who would later go on to win the general election, receiving 23% of the vote to DeSantis's 39%.
Return to Florida House.
When State Representative Dave Hood, Jr. decided to run for a seat on the Volusia County Circuit Court rather than seek re-election, Costello jumped into the race to succeed him in the 25th District, which is based in eastern Volusia County, including Ormond Beach, Daytona Beach Shores, Port Orange, Ponce Inlet, and New Smyrna Beach.

<doc id="36892586" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36892586" title="Quasi-harmonic approximation">
Quasi-harmonic approximation

The quasi-harmonic approximation is a phonon-based model of solid-state physics used to describe volume-dependent thermal effects, such as the thermal expansion. It is based on the assumption that the harmonic approximation holds for every value of the lattice constant, which is to be viewed as an adjustable parameter.
Overview.
The quasi-harmonic approximation expands upon the harmonic phonon model of lattice dynamics. The harmonic phonon model states that all interatomic forces are purely harmonic, but such a model is inadequate to explain thermal expansion, as the equilibrium distance between atoms in such a model is independent of temperature.
Thus in the quasi-harmonic model, from a phonon point of view, phonon frequencies become volume-dependent in the quasi-harmonic approximation, such that for each volume, the harmonic approximation holds.
Thermodynamics.
For a lattice, the Helmholtz free energy "F" in the quasi-harmonic approximation is
formula_1
where "U" is the internal lattice energy, "EZP" is the vibrational zero-point energy of the lattice, "T" is the absolute temperature, "V" is the volume and "S" is the entropy due to the vibrational degrees of freedom. The specific definition of the volume is of no particular importance, as long as the definition is used consistently throughout. It can be the volume per primitive unit cell, volume per conventional unit cell, or even molar volume. This choice does not affect the following in any way.
The zero-point energy term equals
formula_2
where "N" is the number of terms in the sum, k is a wave vector, "i" denotes a phonon band, "h" is Planck's constant and νk,"i"(V) is the frequency of a phonon with wave vector k in the "i"-th band at volume "V".
The entropy term equals
formula_3
where "k"B is the Boltzmann constant. The frequency ν as a function of k is the dispersion relation. Note that for a constant value of "V", these equations corresponds to that of the harmonic approximation.
By applying a Legendre transform, it is possible to obtain the Gibbs free energy "G" of the system as a function of temperature and pressure.
formula_4
Where "P" is the pressure. The minimal value for "G" is found at the equilibrium volume for a given "T" and "P".
Derivable quantities.
Once the Gibbs free energy is known, many thermodynamic quantities can be determined as first- or second-order derivatives. Below are a few which cannot be determined through the harmonic approximation alone.
Equilibrium volume.
"V"("P","T") is determined as a function of pressure and temperature by minimizing the Gibbs free energy.
Thermal expansion.
The volumetric thermal expansion αV can be derived from "V"("P","T") as
formula_5
Grüneisen parameter.
The Grüneisen parameter γ is defined for every phonon mode as
formula_6
where "i" indicates a phonon mode. The total Grüneisen parameter is the sum of all γis. It is a measure of the anharmonicity of the system and closely related to the thermal expansion.

St. Joseph Freinademetz German National Parish, Beijing

St. Joseph Freinademetz Parish is a national parish based in Beijing, China, which serves German-speakers who either reside in or are visiting China. It was established during the 1980s and is under the patronage of St. Joseph Freinademetz, S.V.D., a missionary to China in the 19th century.
History of German fellowship in Beijing.
During the early 1980s Mass was being celebrated in German by the Jesuit priest, Prof. Franz-Anton Neyer, S.J., who was head of the Department of German Studies at Sophia University in Tokyo during the 1980s and 1990s. He would travel to Beijing for each Mass. In 1987 a German-speaking priest became the resident pastor for the Beijing area and began to offer church services in German regularly. The German ambassador, Hanspeter Hellbeck, and his administration team welcomed all-German speaking Catholics warmly in the embassy. In the following year the parish developed and grew.
Highlights of those early days: 
At the end of the 1990s, the original pastor left and the parish was then served served by a Father Birtel, and later a Father Rotermann from Manila, the Philippines. In this heard times it was even possible to celebrate a first holy communion and offer church services in Beijing frequently.
In 2001 a Pastoral Council was formed and ecumenical collaboration with the German-speaking Protestant Congregation in Beijing, under the leadership of Pastor Heinke, became stronger and stronger. Both churches set up an ecumenical bible study group, an ecumenical choir and an ecumenical Taizé-fellowship group. Several ecumenical church services during the year and organizing an ecumenical Bible Day became common events in the city. 
The pastor also attended the Annual Conference of German-speaking clergy in Asia and organized these for about 10 participants during Spring 2010 in Beijing. Further highlight during the history: 
Recent activities of the congregation.
The major goals for the founding of the Parish of St. Joseph Freinademetz are both being the religious home for German-speaking Catholics in Beijing and providing a bit of German culture in China. It is a bridgehead and contact point for all foreigners visiting Beijing or living and working in the municipal area. 
First of all, the parish offers Mass every second Saturday evening in the German embassy. But also the other catholic sacraments are offend to German speaking foreigners. Every autumn groups with candidates for first holy communion and confirmation were formed. Baptism, wedding, confession and extreme unction are offered on demand after contact with our father Michael-Heinrich Bauer. Furthermore the congregation participates at the cultural life in Beijing’s German community. 
The parish’s patron Joseph Freinademetz came to China during the 19th century as a missionary and bore witness for Jesus Christ, in particularly in Shandong Province, dying while nursing victims of an outbreak of typhus. The parish commits to his tradition and peaceful guide and intends to stay together in harmony with other Christian congregations in China, and to follow up ecumenism. Therefore there are good and strong relations with the German Protestant church in Beijing, with the local Archbishop of Beijing, with several other Catholic congregations of foreigners in Beijing and other Christian congregations in China.
Finally St. Joseph Freinademetz Parish matches the recent religious situation within Peoples’ Republic of China.

Plot.
Jesus is a really nice guy; he is always smiling, caring and looking at the bright side of life. He works as a pizza delivery guy, and at a restaurant´s kitchen, too. He also studies administration at night. He arrived in Chicago six years ago when he left his hometown, Monterrey, after ending a tormenting relationship with Veronica, who suffocated him with her obsessive order. When they broke up, he decided to change of environment and left the city, chasing the American dream.
Through a social network, he finds out that Veronica has a 6 year old daughter called Valentina. Immediately, Jesus realizes that lovely girl could be his daughter, and bringing his past back to life, he decides to call his ex-girlfriend and discover the truth. Verónica admits Valentina is his daughter but tells him that she does not need him in her life since she is married to a wonderful man; but Jesus is eager to meet his daughter, so he decides to get back.
Since he has no money saved, he turns to Ury, a Russian immigrant and regular customer at the Pizza restaurant. He helps him by buying the plane ticket for him, but in return, he asks him to bring a suitcase full of clothes for an asylum. Jesus accepts right away, happy to have the chance of meeting his little daughter; however, he ignores that the suitcase has a hidden compartment with thousands of dollars in it. Ury calls Rogelio Rivadeneira, owner and chairman to a successful company, and informs him that his money is on its way. Rogelio is an arrogant and successful man for whom the most important thing in life is he. Not even Alma, his beautiful girlfriend, comes first in his heart.
When arriving at the airport, Jesus is arrested for money laundering and is presented before the authority. Without any other choice to be saved, he declares everything he knows. This way, Ury is arrested in Chicago, and Jesus is freed under custody. When Rogelio learns he has lost nearly a million dollars, he swears to take revenge from he who has spoiled his business.
With his life completely destroyed, out of money, jobless and holding now a penal background, Jesus must start over. He shows up at Veronica´s and he can finally hold Valentina in his arms, but Veronica demands him to have a job and a place to live in order to let him see his daughter again. He later on forms a friendship with Veronica's husband Elias Franco.
When Alma, Rogelio´s beautiful and talented girlfriend, discovers Rogelio´s brother, Fernando, having an affair with one of the company´s secretaries, she decides angrily to get a secretary with whom Fernando cannot fool around, and plans to hire the ugliest one there is. However, it is destiny that brings Jesus to apply for a job there. When Alma and Jesus meet... something happens between them...their looks, their hearts, that something that only happens when love rules.
Jesus is looking for a job in the accounting department, and Alma is looking for a secretary, but none of them clarifies that and Alma thinks it is not a bad idea to have an efficient male secretary instead of a sexy woman. Ignoring the penal background he holds, she decides to hire Jesus without letting him know the position for which he is being hired.
Jesus finds a place to live at a tenement house, downtown. There, he meets his neighbor, Luisa Herrera ( nicknamed "Chatita"), a sophisicated woman who is in the first phase of Alzheimer, but happens to be absolutely adorable. That woman is like a mother to him.
When Jesus is told that he will be the company´s secretary, he rejects the job, arguing that he is more than just a secretary and leaves the company angrily. Chatita reminds him that if he wants to see his daughter, he is to accept the job. This way, Jesus goes back to the company, ready to become the best of secretaries; however, he ignores that the company´s owner is also the owner of the suitcase and the money he was taken off at the airport. On top of that, Fernando, who is also going to be his boss, has decided to make his life miserable in order to make him quit and have Jessica back.
A story full of misunderstandings, romance, comedy and melodrama; which shows the daily struggle of common people trying to survive their financial shortcomings and injustice in life. A story with endearing characters that highlights the fundamental values of life and proves that nothing is impossible when... love rules.

Early years.
Dillingham attended St. Francis High School in Mountain View, California. As a senior he threw for 1,505 yards with 11 touchdowns.
College career.
After not seeing any game action as a freshman in 2001, Pat played in seven games and started against Stanford during his Sophomore year. During the 2002 season, Dillingham completed 41 of 81 passes for 434 yards with one touchdown and seven interceptions. Dillingham came off the bench replacing an injured Carlyle Holiday to drive a comeback against Michigan State in the final minutes. 
His most memorable play was during the Boston College game. Coming off an 8-0 start, Notre Dame was heavily favored in a home match up against an unranked opponent. Carlyle Holiday sustained a head injury, forcing Dillingham to take over in the first half. Tied at 7, Dillingham was leading a drive and made it to the red zone. On a scoring drive Dillingham threw a shovel pass to a BC linebacker who returned it 71 yards to score. This was ultimately the decisive touchdown as neither team scored in the second half. 
In his Junior season, Dillingham only saw playing time in a single drive against Stanford.

Middle Fork, Henderson County, Tennessee

Middle Fork, alternately known as Middlefork or Lizard Lick, is a settlement located in the southwestern portion of Henderson County, Tennessee. It is situated 10 1/2 miles south of Lexington, Tennessee on Highway 22A and is part of Luray, Tennessee.
The community was settled prior to the formation of the county in 1821. The first organized church in Henderson County was Middle Fork Primitive Baptist Church which was chartered in 1823.
Middle Fork was one of the original post offices in the county, and was situated at the crossroads of the Lexington-Purdy Road and the Jackson-Saltillo Road. A small salt lick gave rise to the moniker of Lizard Lick. The Post Office was closed in 1892 and re-opened, as Middlefork while Dr. Arnold was postmaster. The post office was closed and consolidated into the Luray Post office in 1904 when rural routes from the railroad were established. Obediah Hendricks and John Crook, early settlers of the area, were appointed to the first County Court upon the creation of Henderson County in 1821. By 1836 Frederick Phelps and Nicholas Garrett had also settled in the community. 
Situated within a few miles of Pinson Mounds, Middle Fork has also produced several sites for Native American artifacts such as arrow heads, drills, scrapers, and pieces of pottery.
During the Civil War, Middle Fork furnished men to several Tennessee Confederate infantry regiments: 13th, 27th, 51st, 52nd, and Browns 55th; and several cavalry regiments: 18th Newsome's and Wilson's 21st. Henry Carver, buried at Middle Fork Primitive Baptist Church, was the first casualty during the War. Lt. John Willis Dodds, 21st Tenn Cav was the victim of hanging by the 6th Tenn Union Cavalry in March 1864.
Although no major skirmish or battle occurred at Middle Fork, the skirmish at nearby Clarks Creek, TN on September 23rd, 1863 led to a small occurance near the community. Several rifles were left behind and the Union soldiers took them to the blacksmith shop and bent the barrells, and then threw them into a ditch.
Middle Fork and Big Springs Schools were started in 1877, and a black school, Joyners Grove, in 1908. Middle Fork School moved from the downtown area in 1895 to the current site. The present building was erected in 1920 and was closed during County consolidation in 1960.

Gemma Louise Prescott (born 25 September 1983 in Truro) is a Paralympian athlete from England competing in F32 throwing events. Prescott represented England in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, taking the bronze medal in the SP shot put. She has represented the Great Britain team twice in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.
Career history.
Prescott was born in Truro in 1983. Prescott, who has cerebral palsy, attended Great Sankey High School. She was introduced athletics after being invited to a 'have a go' day at the age of 15. Prescott explored wheelchair racing and swimming before settling on the throwing events and was invited to compete at the DSE National Junior Championships in Blackpool in 1998. After leaving school, Presott matriculated to the University of St Andrews, where she graduated with a Masters Degree in mathematics.
In 2005 Prescott entered the Paralympic World Cup taking gold in the F32 discus and silver in the F32 shot. In 2008 qualified for Great Britain team at the Beijing Paralympics. She entered into the discus and shot put finishing 7th and 8th respectively.
In 2010 she was selected for the England team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. She entered in the shot put, the only women's throwing event for athletes with a disability at the tournament. Prescott threw 5.54m which was good enough to take the bronze medal. 2010 also saw her take gold at the German National Disability Championships. Prescott also made the decision in 2010 to begin the switch from discus to the club throw, as the F32 discus had been dropped from the 2012 Summer Paralympics' programme. Her personal best at the club throw at the end of the season was a distance of 14.52m achieved in Stoke at a BWAA International.
The next year she was selected to represent Great Britain at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. She entered both the shot put and club throw, finishing 7th in the shot, but took the bronze medal in the club throw with a new personal best of 16.40m. Prescott improved her club further five months later, throwing 17.18 at the BWAA Grand Prix in Stoke. In 2012 she was selected for the Great Britain team at the Summer Paralympics, entering the club throw and F32 shot put. She had improved on her personal best in the club going into the Games, with a 19.62m throw at Chelmsford in May. In the Paralympic club throw finals she threw 20.50m for 1015 points, a British and European record, taking the bronze medal.

A Lion's Tale

"A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex" is an autobiography of professional wrestler, Chris Jericho. It details his life from his early years, to his début for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), on August 9, 1999. The book is followed by a sequel, "", which was released in 2011. A second sequel to Jericho's autobiography is planned and is expected to be released in 2014.
History.
Jericho started writing "A Lion's Tale" shortly after leaving the WWE, in August 2005. For the purposes of the book, which mainly detail his life from 1990–1999, WWE is referred to as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), as this was the name of the company when Jericho made his début. The World Wrestling Federation changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002.
Content.
The book begins with a quick account of Jericho's thoughts whilst making his now-trademark countdown entrance during his WWF début. The book then flashes back to his early years, as a seven year old growing up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Jericho discusses his first exposure to professional wrestling, watching it on a TV in his grandmother's basement. He would later attend American Wrestling Association (AWA) live events at the Winnipeg Arena with his father, former professional ice hockey left winger, Ted Irvine, before being replaced in 1983, by the World Wrestling Federation. As he reached his teens, Jericho would later engage with WWF wrestlers, who would be staying at nearby hotels, when performing in the Winnipeg area. Jericho would later emulate the actions of WWF superstars with friends, in his promotion, the Big Time Wrestling Federation (BTWF).
Jericho later recalls the first time he saw Stampede Wrestling, a wrestling promotion based in Calgary, Alberta, on television in 1986. Jericho states it was shortly after this time that this was when his path (to becoming a professional wrestler) became written in stone, as he watched Owen Hart, (who was of a similar build) perform his entrance. It was whilst watching a Stampede show, that Jericho (then seventeen years old) saw an advert for the Hart Brothers Pro Wrestling Camp. Jericho promptly wrote to the address on the screen, hoping to enroll. A few weeks later, he received a reply from Ed Langley, the Hart Brothers Camp representative, who stated that Jericho needed to be eighteen years old and meet the weight classification of around . Jericho would spend the next year graduating from high school and attending Red River Community College, obtaining a degree in Journalism, following the advice given to him by Jesse "The Body" Ventura", to have something to fall back on, after meeting Ventura at a celebrity hockey game that Jericho's father was playing in.
From there, Jericho recalls a brief meeting with Keith Hart during the summer of 1988, at the Hart Brothers Camp in Okotoks, whilst accompanying his father to a charity golf game in Calgary. Later that summer, Jericho joined local promotion, the Keystone Wrestling Alliance (KWA) and began touring as part of their ring crew. After the tour ended, Jericho headed for the Hart Brothers Pro Wrestling Camp and it was there he met another future fellow professional wrestler, Lance Storm.
Jericho's book later tells of his début match for the Canadian Wrestling Connection (CWC), against Storm (billed as Lance T. Storm) on October 2, 1990, as "Cowboy" Chris Jerico, a cowboy from Casper, Wyoming, in a 10 minute time limit draw and working the Canadian independent circuit, before travelling to Mexico and Germany, wrestling professionally for Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) and travelling to Japan, before returning to the U.S. and signing with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1996, thanks to a recommendation from fellow wrestler (and future author), Mick Foley. Jericho would go on to win the ECW Television Championship once during his tenure for the Philadelphia-based organization, before signing for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), later in the year.
As a WCW employee, Jericho would end up winning the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on four separate occasions and the WCW World Television Championship, between 1996–98. Jericho's popularity in WCW was at its peak when he began taunting and challenging Bill Goldberg, with humorous vignettes. Goldberg had been undefeated in WCW since débuting and Jericho teased a very likely Goldberg-Jericho match-up. Sadly, the angle was dropped and the match never materialized. It was at this point, frustrated by the lack of faith shown in him to be a top draw in the wrestling business, that Jericho realized his WCW career was over.
Feeling his career was on shaky ground, Jericho's personal life took an unexpected turn. Whilst eating in a Japanese restaurant in Tampa, Florida, Jericho met his future wife, Jessica, through fellow WCW employee, Disco Inferno, who introduced the pair to one another. Shortly after meeting Jessica, Jericho sprained his ankle during a match with Booker T. He was told he would be unable to wrestle for six weeks – Jericho had sixteen weeks left on his WCW contract at this point. After realizing that he had decided not to renew his contract, WCW President, Eric Bischoff suspended Jericho for the remaining four months of his contract. He never appeared for the promotion on television again, only at live shows. Jericho wrestled his last match in WCW as a tag team, teaming with Eddy Guerrero against the team of Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio, Jr., on July 21. Five days later, Jericho sent a fax to Eric Bischoff, the day his WCW contract expired, to thank him for all the opportunities he'd been given, in his three years there. It was during this time that Jericho called Rich Ward, the two had previously met backstage at a WCW event in San Antonio, Texas and share the same sense of humour and their love of heavy metal music. Ward suggested that Jericho come to Atlanta to sing with his band Fozzy Osbourne. Jericho would later join the band and Fozzy Osbourne would later evolve into the heavy metal band, Fozzy, with Jericho as the lead vocalist and Ward playing lead guitar and singing back-up vocals.
On May 23, 1999, at the WWF pay-per-view, Over the Edge, a freak accident occurred, which resulted in the death of Owen Hart. Although he didn't know Owen personally, Jericho felt obliged (as a surrogate member of the Hart family) to attend his funeral. It was at the funeral, during a conversation with Hulk Hogan that Jericho decided that he wanted to leave WCW and sign with the WWF. He would do so a month later, on June 30.
Now as a fully-fledged WWF employee, Jericho would spend the next few weeks coming up with ideas to introduce himself to WWF fans. He recalls standing in a post office, looking at a "Countdown to the Millennium" clock and decided to use the idea as his WWF entrance, which became his signature. The book ends as Jericho makes his WWF début on the August 9 episode of WWF RAW is WAR, at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois.
Because of last minute changes, Jericho acknowledges the events of the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide, which occurred in June 2007. Shortly after Jericho finished writing in May 2007 and had handed in his copy of the manuscript to Grand Central Publishing, he requested and was allowed to make some final alterations to the book, to reflect upon the Benoit tragedy.

Pite-Rönnskär

Pite-Rönnskär is a Swedish island with lighthouse station located in the Bothnian Bay. The island is located at the border between the provinces of Västerbotten and Norrbotten but belongs to Skellefteå Municipality. The island was a well known fishing village for many years and contains a chapel dating from 1771. In 1821 a pilot station was located on the island. Today the fishing cabins on the island is used as summer residences. The island has a weather station, and wind observations from it is reported by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute in their shipping forecast.
The first lighthouse on the island was lit in 1880. It was built on the gable of a keeper's house and carried a kerosene lamp. In 1905 the current lighthouse was constructed on the island. It was first built in 1862 as one of two lighthouses at the Sandhammaren light station in Scania. When it was relocated the current fresnel lens and a gas mantle light was installed. It was replaced with a Dalén light in 1944 and in 1959 it was electrified. In 1972 the lighthouse was deactivated as The Swedish Maritime Administration found that the modern lighthouse Nygrån (built 1959) placed in open water was enough to provide sea safety. Nygrån was partly destroyed by ice in 1969-1971 and during this years Pite-Rönnskär was the main lighthouse in the area.
In August 2005 the lighthouse was reactivated as an Occas-light by local summer residents on the island. The light shows the original character with three white flashes each 15th second and uses the original lens. It is owned by the city of Skellefteå. The lighhouse is the highest of the "Heidenstam lights".

Deekline

Nicholas Annand (born December 20, 1979 in London), better known as DJ Dee Kline or Deekline, is a British producer and DJ of dance, breakbeat, breakstep and garage music. He is the innovator of breakstep music which is bass-heavy, breakbeat-infused 2-step, first characterised in his 1999 hit "I Don't Smoke", which reached #11 on the UK charts. He is the owner of Rat Records, which has released material of such artists as DJ Fresh, Jack Beats, Stanton Warriors, Wiley, Skinny Man, Rennie Pilgrem, House Breakers and Freq Nasty. Annand has also had notable collaborations with British electronic music producers Ed Solo and Wizard. In 2011, he opened up his online clothing store, Bass Boutique.
Biography.
Deekline began collecting records at the age of 10, inspired by early funk, electro and hip-hop scratch DJs. He began playing house parties and raves in the London underground electronic music scene before getting involved with pirate radio.
1998–2000: Flex FM and "I Don't Smoke".
He became owner of London’s biggest pirate radio station Flex FM which predominantly played UK garage music and other underground electronic music. In 1999, he set up Rat Records to release his track "I Don't Smoke". It sold 20,000 copies on Rat Records, and then it went on to sell another 150,000, reaching number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The bass-heavy, breakbeat-infused garage sound characterised on "I Don't Smoke" became known as breakstep. The song features a sample of comedian Marcus Brigstocke impersonating one of Jim Davidson's characters, repeating the title phrase "I don't smoke the reefer" in a faux Rasta accent. Annand supposedly came across the sample when he'd rang a friend and heard Davidson on the answering machine. He thought it would make a good hook for a track. The DJ/producer told "Mojo" magazine: "I think he was a bit cheesed off that it had been used. He wanted a slice of the cake."
Brigstocke (possibly best known from the British TV show "Argumental"), is sampled on "I Don't Smoke" as saying, "I don't smoke cigarettes, I don't smoke cigars, I don't smoke a pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe...". He talked about it on the "Graham Norton Show" in 2010, where he explained that he was impersonating Jim Davidson's character Chalkie White for a sketch show, and that it was sampled into the track. Brigstocke said he was "delighted and mortified at the same time" when he heard the sample.
Breakstep and "I Don't Smoke" were seminal in shaping the underground electronic music scene in London, paving the way for grime and dubstep. Deekline retired from Flex FM in 2002 to focus on his own music after "I Don't Smoke" was signed by East West Records.
2002–present.
Deekline has remixed and collaborated with a variety of notable producers and has had international chart success with songs such as "The Mexican" with producer Tim Healey and "Shake the Pressure" with Florida booty bass pioneers Splack Pack. In addition to this, his collaborative projects with producer 'Wizard' on Deekline & Wizard's "Breaks, Beats and Blondes" and with Ed Solo on his "Jungle Cakes" EPs have received international success. He also collaborated with such artists as Luke from 2 Live Crew, Splack Pack, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, Tim Healey, Stanton Warriors, Freestylers and Krafty Kuts. Deekline reworked "I Don't Smoke" for 2014 alongside trap producers Specimen A and added a new rap by Majestic. "I Don't Smoke 2014" is scheduled for release.

In their eight-year history the team won the Scudetto in three successive seasons (1984–1986) as well as the Coppa Italia in 1983.
Playing as ACF Gusmai Trani the club won promotion from Serie B (Girone D) in their second season. In 1982 ACF Marmi Trani finished third in their first season at the top level. They finished second in the 1983 Serie A after losing a play–off to Alaska Lecce, but won the Coppa Italia by beating Tigullio 72 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.
In 1984 they merged with champions Alaska Lecce to become ACF Alaska Trani, inheriting Lecce's prolific Scottish striker Rose Reilly. That season Trani won the league for the first time, then retained their title in 1985 as ACF Sanitas Trani.

Ellerbusch Site

The Ellerbusch Site (12-W-56) is a small but significant archaeological site in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Indiana. Unlike many sites created by people of the same culture, it occupies an upland site near a major river floodplain. Its existence appears to have been the result of the coincidence of periods of peace and growth in the related Angel Site, which led some townspeople to leave their homes for new villages that were more convenient for resource gathering. Researched partly because of its small size, Ellerbusch has produced information that greatly increases present awareness of other small sites and of its culture's overall patterns of settlement in the region. Because of its archaeological value, the site was declared a historic site in the late twentieth century.
Environment.
Ellerbusch occupies about on a small hilltop within an agricultural field, west of the town of Newburgh. The site is located in far southwestern Warrick County, lying less than a mile away from the Ohio River and less than two miles from the Angel Mounds State Historic Site in Vanderburgh County. Until it was drained in the 1890s, a small lake lay immediately north of the site. Known as "Alford loess", the soil at the site is well suited for seasonal agriculture. The immediate vicinity is known to be archaeologically rich; although a cursory survey in 1954 failed to find Ellerbusch and revealed nothing in any other part of section 33 of Ohio Township, it revealed four substantial sites in adjacent sections, including a village on the riverbank about to the southwest of where Ellerbusch was later discovered.
Excavation.
The first excavations at the site were undertaken by the Ellerbusch family, who owned the property, working with their neighbors George and Francis Martin of the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University in Bloomington. The Martins arranged for the aid of an IU graduate student in the early excavations, and with his help they revealed the site of one house, part of another, and a pit with decorated potsherds in the summer of 1957; this initial excavation was published in the following year. Comparatively little was done in 1958 and 1959, and no further work was performed except for a very limited excavation in 1962.
In June 1973, an IU doctoral student began to study the possibility of renewing work at the now-overgrown Ellerbusch Site. In the succeeding few months, Thomas J. Green conducted a more intensive investigation of the site: while the Ellerbusches and Martins had excavated a single house in what amounted to a large test excavation, Green conducted careful work on of the site. His excavation was meant to use Ellerbusch in order to pioneer extensive study at one of southwestern Indiana's smaller Mississippian sites, which to that point had received very little intensive attention. The work was funded by the Black Laboratory, which wanted to excavate a small site extensively in order to understand smaller sites' economic activities, the organization of their communities, and the times of year when they were occupied. Moreover, the excavation of a small site was deemed necessary for a broader awareness of typical Mississippian settlement patterns, because scholars' concentration on large sites meant that nothing more than hypotheses could be offered to understand relationships between such centers and the small outlying sites surrounding them. Besides the work done by the owners, Green's reasons for choosing Ellerbusch included its upland location beside a lake, its proximity to Angel, the fact that virtually everything collected from the site was owned by the property owners (thus permitting a unified collection of artifacts, in contrast to the dispersion of artifacts among many collections that is typical of such sites), and the evidence from previous work that the houses had not been rebuilt numerous times as they had at Angel.
Artifacts recovered.
Early excavations.
The initial excavations by the Ellerbusches and Martins revealed 129 sherds — 41 clay-tempered sandy pieces, 61 cord-marked, 18 plain, and 9 small decorated pieces that could not easily be classified — 23 stone tools, most of which were knives, and occasional pieces of mica and cannel coal. Based on the pottery that they found, Frances Martin proposed that the site originated primarily during the Middle Woodland period in an occupation influenced by Hopewellian peoples, and she saw certain elements of the pottery as linking the site to the Swift Creek culture that was based in Georgia.
Pottery.
Green's excavation demonstrated that the site had few artifacts on the surface, and no midden could be found at all; all artifacts not found on the surface were located in the plow zone or in features such as pits. Nevertheless, he was able to find evidence of three houses in addition to the one revealed by the initial excavation; when his work at the site was complete, a total of 7,379 artifacts had been catalogued. Among the most important types of items recovered were lamellar blades, chert from stone hoes, certain types of projectile points, and identifiable types of pottery. Excavations through 1977 yielded 3,466 sherds of pottery, including 582 from the Woodland period, and 2,884 shards that were attributable to the Angel Phase; over 98% of them are shell-tempered without decoration. This is comparable to the pottery found at Angel, where less than one percent of the many thousands of pieces of pottery bore ornamental ceramic elements. Conversely, while many of the decorated remnant of Angel sherds bear either a red film or negative painting, the same is true of just six pieces of Ellerbusch pottery. Nevertheless, these six sherds' presence contributes to the site's identification as a site of the Angel Phase, as negative painting is a crucial component of Angel Phase pottery. Most sherds found at the site were small; of the 151 pieces of shell-tempered pottery, only 19 were large enough for the excavation team to determine the shape of the pottery from which the sherds came. As a result, the number of pottery objects originally present at the site could not be estimated reliably; most comparable sites yield larger sherds with fewer fractures, although as a high proportion of Ellerbusch sherds were found in or above the plow zone, their small size is comparable to sherds found in the upper levels at Angel, which typically had been broken into smaller pieces by repeated plowing.
Lithics.
Virtually all of the non-pottery artifacts recovered at Ellerbusch through 1977 were stone tools or pieces thereof; Green reports that 3,907 stone artifacts (out of a total of 7,379, and all but six of that total excluding the 3,466 sherds,) were found at the site. Unfortunately, more than five out of every six were recovered by surface collection instead of excavation, demonstrating the substantial amount of damage done by plowing and natural erosion. More than 3,800 of the stone artifacts were chipped stone (either cores or smaller pieces), and three of every four chips were lithic flakes without any sign of modification after creation. Another 124 pieces were projectile points of a wide range of forms, as well as 164 items that appear to be fragments of other points. Other forms of identifiable chipped-stone tools recovered at Ellerbusch include knives, drills, scrapers, one shredder (a tool similar to a scraper, but used for tearing instead of scraping), and numerous flakes with signs of having once been parts of hoes. Ground stone artifacts were observed of types such as pestles, nutting stones, and hammerstones, as well as miscellaneous objects such as pieces of two Woodland gorgets, a single copper bead, and a small pipe of a form frequently found at Angel and similar Mississippian sites.
Houses.
Among the portions of the site excavated in 1973 was the house that the Ellerbusches had revealed. The superimposition of certain features demonstrated that two houses had occupied the site, with one seemingly having been built immediately after the other's destruction; both were approximately the same size ( by ) and were oriented in the same direction. Both houses appear to have relied on the structural support of vertical posts and supports located in wall trenches; only one pit (which appears to have been a hearth) was found in a house at the site. Another house site excavated in 1973 had been the site of three or four different houses in turn; besides its own postholes, the second house site is associated with ten nearby pits and a pile of stone chips of a type of chert comparable to what is commonly found in Harrison County to the east. Rather than being identical in form, the houses were either of two or three different types, and because no useful distinction between house types appears to have existed, it seems that the different types of houses were constructed at different times. Partial remains of other structures, including two other houses, remained at the site, but plowing had greatly reduced the amount of area with surviving features from these structures. All of the houses were generally rectangular in shape, with the sides being built first and the corners either being filled in later without support posts or left open as doorways; none of the sides of any of the houses showed openings that were likely to have been doorways. The presence of houses is the primary basis for Green's argument that Ellerbusch was a farming hamlet instead of a processing center for hunters: stone tools found at the site could have been used for animal processing, but the construction of houses at a site just a few miles away from Angel would have represented wasted effort for wide-roaming hunters but a worthwhile investment of time for sedentary farmers.
Other.
Besides the evidence of Mississippian occupation, Ellerbusch yielded limited amounts of information (largely projectile points) from previous cultural periods. The edges of Willow Pond on the site's northern edge, along with smaller sites nearby, produced artifacts from throughout North American prehistory, including the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Woodland periods. In the hamlet site proper, evidence was found of a Middle Woodland occupation; both it and the Angel occupation are shallow enough to make stratigraphy difficult, but not impossible. Below the plow zone, undisturbed features were found, including hearths, walls of houses, and small pits; while they could have been used for storage, these pits' small size likely precludes any purpose for them aside from refuse holes. Unusually for a Mississippian site, the houses appear to have been built simply on the surface of the ground; Ellerbusch shows no evidence of the common Mississippian practice of building houses on a specially prepared floor below the surface of the ground. The usefulness of the site for research purposes was hindered by a combination of two factors: because the site sits atop a hill, erosion from rainwater and modern plowing had destroyed most of its context by mixing artifacts from different periods, and because the soil was strongly acidic, one bone was the only significant survivor of all animal materials that had once been located at the site.
Conclusions.
Relationships with Angel.
Ellerbusch's location near the Ohio River is typical of Angel Phase communities, which commonly occupied terraces above the floodplain of the Ohio or of other rivers. The inhabitants appear to have favored floodplains partly because of their productivity: uplands are more susceptible to erosion and tend to dry out more rapidly, and without the use of crop rotation or modern fertilizers, upland fields would be depleted in just a few growing seasons. Moreover, people of the Angel Phase typically used wood as fuel, and residents of a floodplain can find wood more easily than upland peoples by utilizing driftwood. Furthermore, riverside villagers have easier access to water for drinking and washing, and they could supplement their diet by fishing and hunting animals that came to drink at the river, rather than depending solely on the chase. While the Angel Site was the premier settlement of the region, hamlets such as Ellerbusch were established for the sake of efficiency: had everyone lived at Angel, the time spent each day walking to distant fields would have been excessive, but by establishing villages amidst the fields, the people were able to use their time far more efficiently. Moreover, the upland area immediately surrounding the site was suitable for short-term cultivation, as Alford loess soil is easily cultivated and can be as fertile as floodplains. It seems that warfare was the only restraint on the further spread of Ellerbusch-type sites to a greater distance — because they were frequently in conflict with other peoples, the Angel Phase population needed to be able to take refuge at the stockaded Angel Site instead of remaining at defenseless small villages. Consequently, Ellerbusch and related sites were more intensively occupied during what appear to have been periods of peace. While excavations at Ellerbusch could not be used to provide a conclusive interpretation of certain features at Angel, they permitted a better understanding of yet smaller sites.
Dating and classification.
Two radiocarbon dates were realized for the site, placing the Mississippian occupation at points between AD 200-320 and 990-1110. While Green stated that the first was plainly an error, the second he saw as disputable: it seemed somewhat early but was comparable to other early Mississippian sites in the region. Later authors, including Green himself, have seen the third-century result as evidence for a Woodland period occupation of the site, rather than as an erroneous reading; this view is bolstered by the presence of pottery comparable to what has been recovered at the Mann Site to the west, a leading Hopewell site from the Middle Woodland period.
Green calls Ellerbusch a hamlet, a classification that he assigns to Angel sites with:
Having defined Ellerbusch as a hamlet, he determined its population and used the resulting figure as his basis for estimating the population of other hamlets. Previous studies proposed that households at the culture's sites averaged five members, and evidence at Ellerbusch suggests that only two or three of its four houses were used at any given time. Because such a figure yields ten or fifteen residents in the site's ½-acre area, slightly larger populations have been proposed for hamlets with twice the area. Likewise, a hamlet's lack of extensive occupation (resulting in little cultural material on the surface) was defined from the small influence that its residents exercised on the surrounding terrain. Out of sixty-eight Angel Phase sites that were known in 1977, Green classified six as hamlets.
Recognition.
In early 1991, the Ellerbusch Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its significance as an important archaeological site. It is one of three Warrick County archaeological sites on the Register, along with a small part of the Angel Site and the entirety of the Yankeetown Site, located along the Ohio River to the southeast.

Reception.
"Megas XLR" has been met with positive reception. Kevin Pezzano of Revolution SF said: "The best thing about this whole show is the way it takes none of it seriously. It doesn't even take itself seriously. The characters are likeable, but are often the objects of this series' humor as much as the pop-culture references are," calling it "must-see" and saying "it's clever, it's funny, it's action-packed" and "just plain messed-up at times." Matthew Anderson of DVD Vision Japan praised the show's humor and voice acting, and called the animation "fluid, and very detailed." "Megas XLR" was ranked at No. 4 on ToonZone's "Toons of the 2000s: Top 5 Cartoon Network Originals".

2012–13 Eastleigh F.C. season

The 2012–13 season will be the 33rd season in the history of Eastleigh, being known as Eastleigh F.C. The club is competing in the Conference South for the 8th consecutive season, which started in the 2005–06 season following reorganisation of clubs in the 6th Level of English football. This will also be the first full season under the ownership of Bridle Insurance Limited, who bought the club in November of the previous season.
Season commentary.
Pre-Season (May to July).
At the end of the 2011-12 season, the club announced the pitch at the Silverlake Stadium was to be renovated. Pitch specialists Speedcut Contractors Ltd have been called in to re-seed the stadium's pitch, as well as the club's training ground on Lower Hardmoor. Speedcut are known for undetaking the same work at Brentford F.C last year.
Soon after the end of the 2011-12, the club announced their first signing of the pre-season, with striker Marvin Williams joining from Salisbury City on a 2-year contract. Marvin’s claim to fame is his cousin is former England, Arsenal and Crystal Palace legend, Ian Wright. Williams started his career at Millwall as a trainee, and has also played for Yeovil Town, Brentford and Swedish club Östersunds FK.
On 4 May, the club announced 4 players were being released. Ian Herring, Richard Gillespie, Scott Rogers and Jamie Brown will leave the club. Chris Flood, who is contracted for the 2012-13 season, has been transfer listed. Several days later it was further announced that young defender Ben Wilson had been released, and long standing midfielder Danny Smith transfer listed.
The club's second signing of the pre-season was announced on 8 May as left sided midfielder Dale Binns from newly promoted side Woking. Binns started his career at Tottenham Hotspur, and has also played over 200 times for current Isthmian League Premier Division side Hendon, scoring 41 times. Unfortunately, the club jumped the gun on the announcement, as following this the player himself denied the deal had been concluded. Ultimately, this did not affect Binns joining the club.
The club's third signing came in the form of Boreham Wood’s defender Osei Sankofa, who agreed a one-year deal. Sanofa was followed by Glen Southam from Dover Athletic and Jai Reason from Braintree Town. These signings announced in May 2012 were in addition to the signing of 19-year-old goalkeeper Jack Dovey from Southampton on a 2-year deal. The signing followed Dovey spending the year on loan with Eastleigh during the 2011-12 season. Shortly after, the club confirmed striker Lee Peacock had signed a 1-year extension to his contract, to the end of the 2012-13 season.
Further departures were announced in June 2012, when youngster Jordace Holder-Spooner left Eastleigh to sign for rivals Basingstoke Town. An extended agreement was announced on 15 June with sponsor 911uk.com, which is a Porsche enthusiast website, to continue the sponsorship for the 2012-13 season, which continues the club's drive over the last 6 months to increase and maintain the number of sponsors. This was followed by an extension to the sponsorship agreement with local motordealer Snows Motor Group, and the unveil of Lawshield as sponsors for the South Stand (opposite the clubhouse end) at the Silverlake Stadium for the 2012-2013 season.
The sole signing announcement in June was of highly regarded Scottish striker Craig McAllister from Newport County. McAllister had previously played for Eastleigh back in 2001 and 2004.
The signing of McAllister was followed in July by ex-Eastleigh Goalkeeper, 41-year-old Wayne Shaw, who returned to the club following his release from rivals Sutton United, and will double up as number 2 to Jack Dovey, and as goalkeeping coach. Shortly after, the club announced the signing on a long term contract of 22-year-old striker/right winger Moses Ademola who joined from 2011-12 Conference South champions Woking. Ademola managed 21 goals in 71 league appearances during his stay at Woking.
The Spitfires made their 10th signing of the summer when the club announced Staines Town left-back Adam Everitt had joined the club. The 30-year old previously played for Eastleigh in the 2007/08 season.
August to October.
Shortly before the start of the season, on 17 August, it was announced that Braintree Town young midfielder Callum McNish had joined the club on an initial one month loan deal.
On Tuesday 11 September, following 3 successive league defeats, the last 4-0 away to newly promoted side Billericay Town, the club announced following a meeting between manager Ian Baird and Stewart Donald, it was agreed that Ian Baird would leave the club with immediate effect. Baird's replacement was announced the following day as ex-Stevenage Borough manager Richard Hill. Hill has also had spells assisting John Gregory at both Wycombe Wanderers and QPR, and Brian Little at Aston Villa. He has also been employed as assistant manager at Gillingham, Tranmere Rovers and Northampton Town. Hill has been positive since his appointment as manager, still targeting promotion after Eastleigh's disappointing start to the season. The new manager began with a good 4 - 2 win in his first match, at home in the league to Maidenhead United.
On 20 September 2012, the club announced the club captain Daryl McMahon had been sold to league rivals Dover Athletic, following 2 failed bids. Glen Southam subsequently inherited the club captaincy.
Eastleigh were looking for a new assistant manager following the departure of Shaun Wilkinson on 2 October. His replacement was later announced as Guy Butters, who most recently had been manager of non-league Winchester City. Wilkinson was followed out of the club shortly afterwards by player-coach Wayne Shaw and defender Gary Elphick. The later left due to Richard Hill having to reduce the size of the playing squad before he can bring in new faces of his own. Marvin Williams departed in late October, as Hill continued to reshape the squad, and create funds within the current budget. Williams was sold to Sutton United.
November to January.
A press release surfaced on 1 November to announce that there had been an improvement in the finances of the club. Former club chairman Paul Murray had agreed to write-off loans totalling £70,000, and convert them into donations. In a similar move, current shareholder Stewart Donald has done the same with loans totalling £190,000.
On Tuesday 20 November, the club's home league match vs Truro City was called off for the second time, due to a waterlogged pitch. The match was previously called off a month previous due to the financial troubles Truro have experienced recently.
The club announced on 27 November that they had created a new partnership with local Premier League club Southampton. The partnership will see some of Southampton’s fixtures in the Barclays U21 Premier League staged at Eastleigh's Silverlake Stadium, and will also see the two clubs’ youth programmes share ideas on how to develop local youth football.
On the same day, the club also announced the departure of joint top scorer Moses Ademola to league rivals Dover Athletic. Ademola, who signed for Eastleigh in the summer on a long term contract, is the second first team player to have been sold to Dover in the 4 months since the start of the season. Admeola was ultimately replaced on 13 December with journeyman striker Richard Pacquette, who had been released on a free transfer from Bromley earlier that week. Earlier during the week, the club's home match vs Truro City was postponed for the third time. The latest 2 postponements due to a frozen pitch, and the first time due to the financial problems of Truro. The match has been rearranged to be played on Tuesday 22 January 2013.
On 20 December, concerning the situation regarding the stadium, the club announced that an offer had previously been made to the board at ‘Ten Acre Holdings’ (the current owners). Following discussions the board of Ten Acre Holdings felt that they were willing to accept the offer presented to them as long as the remaining shareholders also felt a desire to sell the ground at this stage. On this basis a full shareholders meeting was called and the outcome was that a clear large majority were in favour of accepting the offer and that the sale of the freehold should progress.
Ten Acre Holdings had been set up to safeguard the club and enable it to get back on a sound financial footing, which it has achieved over recent years. The proposed purchase is intended to provide the football club with the strongest possible opportunity to continue its progression.
During late December, Richard Hill mentioned his intention for the club to move towards full-time training. The club have twice gone down the road of daytime training before, most recently at the start of the 2011/12 season. On that occasion it was mainly youngsters involved as part of the club's player development programme. But this time Hill will be working exclusively with the first-team squad, where possible. This is due to many of the players having jobs in addition to playing for the club, where they are not in the financial position to be able to give up these jobs to train full-time.
The changing nature of the first team squad continued in January 2013, with the tranfer listing of defenders Osei Sankofa and long serving player Tom Jordan, and the return to Gillingham of on-loan goalkeeper Ross Flitney who was recalled. Striker Richard Pacquette was also released after spending just under a month at the club, scoring once from two appearances. This has been offset by the arrival of defender Alex Lacey from Conference National side Luton Town on a one month loan deal, and the permanent signing of former Hereford United, Northampton Town and Luton Town central defender Dean Beckwith, who has arrived on a contract until the end of the 2013/14 season. Another defender was also signed in Chris Todd from Forest Green Rovers on 10 January on an 18-month contract. Todd has previously played for Exeter City and Torquay United.
February onwards.
Given the build up in the number of defenders by the end of January, long serving defender Tom Jordan was released after 4 and a half years with the club. Jordan was quickly signed by ex-Eastleigh manager Paul Doswell at Sutton United.

<doc id="36892958" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36892958" title="National Rugby League salary cap">
National Rugby League salary cap

In 1990, the NSWRL introduced a salary cap system to even the playing field of teams in the Winfield Cup. The National Rugby League has adopted the salary cap system from its predecessor. A special team headed by former Australian representative Ian Schubert deals with salary cap issues and monitors teams on a yearly basis.
As of 2013 the club grant is $7.1 million which covers the salary cap of $5.85 million for the top twenty-five players at each club. The salary cap will increase to $6.3 million in 2014, $6.55 million in 2015, $6.8 million by 2016 and $7 million in 2017.The minimum wage from 2013 onwards is $80,000 for the top twenty-five players.
In 2010, following the Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal, the NRL introduced requirements for players and their agents to sign statutory declarations pledging their contracts comply with salary cap regulations, where previously only club chairmen and chief executives did so for biannual salary cap audits.
Discussion over the salary cap limit.
The NRL is one of the few major leagues to implement a salary cap in a sport that has competing leagues in other countries where there is either no salary cap or a much higher cap per club. As a result, there has developed a tradition of players from Australia moving to Europe where salaries for the elite, and even for average players, were considerably higher. The NRL chooses to continue with the cap, believing that any reduction in quality of the sporting product due to the loss of these players is less than allowing richer clubs to dominate. In practice, the goal of parity has been quite successful, with nine different clubs winning the premiership in the 14 seasons between 1998 and 2013.
In 2008, the departure of Mark Gasnier and Sonny Bill Williams, two elite stars, to play French rugby union prompted calls for the cap to be raised. Australian rugby league players had suffered a 27% decline in their wages since 1999, whereas other Australian sportsmen had experienced steady, and in some cases explosive growth. Some of the blame has been apportioned to the fact that the media company News Limited was a 50% owner of the NRL, and would normally be expected to be a bidder for rugby league rights in Australia. Being an owner of the game meant News could apportion rights to itself at a discount, reducing the overall income the league could make for itself through the sale of media rights. This had a flow-on effect reducing available income for players. Following the 2009–10 northern rugby union season, global exchange rate changes meant that payments in European currencies were not as attractive, and Gasnier returned to the NRL. Williams returned to his homeland of New Zealand in what proved a successful attempt to play rugby union with the All Blacks, and in 2013 returned to the NRL to play for the Sydney Roosters.
The new Australian Rugby League Commission secured a billion dollar television rights deal in August 2012, and both clubs and players expected a significant increase in the salary cap. Announcements that the cap for 2013 would increase from $4.4 million to only $5 million has resulted in the Rugby League Players Assoiciation agitating for an increase to $6.5 million. The RLPA is also expecting increased retirement funds, income protection and a boost for representative payments.
In July 2013, NRL CEO Dave Smith floated the proposal of a marquee player allowance which could be paid outside the traditional salary cap to help retain the game's biggest stars such as Sydney Roosters Sonny Bill Williams - and help lure back the likes of ex-league player and Wallabies star Israel Folau.
Breaches.
The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the NRL are exceeding the salary cap, falling below the salary floor, not informing the NRL of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents relating to player financial and contract details or engaging in contract tampering. Trading cash for players is also prohibited to prevent wealthier clubs from evading the salary cap and salary floor regulations.
Penalties for players, club officials and agents include fines of the lesser of 10% of the amount involved or $100,000 and/or suspension. Penalties for clubs include fines of the lesser of half the amount involved or $500,000 ($2,500 for each document that is late or incorrectly lodged or lost) and/or deduction of premiership points.
The following breaches of the salary cap and salary floor have occurred:
Notable breaches.
Canterbury season 2002.
In 2002, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs were fined the maximum of $500,000 and deducted all 37 premiership points received during the season after it was found that they had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap totaling $2.13 million over the past three years, including $750,000 in 2001 and $920,000 in 2002; these were described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as "exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature". 
The points penalty meant that the club won the 2002 wooden spoon (South Sydney would have finished last if not for the breaches), and as the club had been leading the competition table prior to the imposition of the penalties, this was a shattering outcome for the club and its fans. Two senior club officials were jailed for fraud as a result of these breaches.
New Zealand Warriors season 2005.
In 2005, the New Zealand Warriors were fined $430,000 and were ordered to start the 2006 season with a four premiership point deficit and cut their payroll by $450,000 after club officials revealed that their former management had exceeded the salary cap by $1.1 million over the last two years. The points penalty meant that the Warriors missed a finals berth in 2006.
Melbourne season 2010.
The Melbourne Storm salary cap breach was a major breach over a period of five years. The discovery of these breaches in 2010 resulted in it stripping the Storm of all honours achieved as a team since 2006 (including the 2007 and 2009 premierships, the 2006, 2007 and 2009 minor premierships and the 2010 World Club Challenge), sentencing them to finish the 2010 NRL season last (of which 75% was still to be played) and fining the club a record $1.689 million. Many NRL supporters believe the punishment was no more than a slap on the wrist as the Storm still celebrated the two championships they were stripped of.

The Whistler (1944 film)

The Whistler is a 1944 American mystery film noir based on the radio drama "The Whistler". Directed by William Castle, the production features Richard Dix, Gloria Stuart and J. Carrol Naish. It is the first of Columbia Pictures' eight "Whistler" films starring Richard Dix produced in the 1940s.
Plot.
A grieving widower and industrialist, Earl C. Conrad, who failed to rescue his wife at sea and must suffer the accusing stares of his friends, hires a hit man to end his own life. But then he learns his wife is alive and tries to call the hit off by finding the intermediary with whom he'd made the contract. Unfortunately, the intermediary is now dead and that man's wife thinks Conrad set him up. This leads to a series of maneuvers and wrong choices on Conrad's part as he becomes the victim of a car wreck, spends the night in a 25-cents-a-bed flop house, and tries to stow away on a Red Cross ship—all while his private secretary, who secretly loves him, struggles to save the man from himself and the low-life enemies he has made along the way. 
Reception.
Critical response.
When the film was released, film critic, Bosley Crowther, panned the film, writing, "Such is the miserable expedient to which Richard Dix is reduced in this weary, illogical imitation of an Alfred Hitchcock (plus an early Fritz Lang) film. For an hour or thereabouts he starts and stumbles just out of reach of a relentless J. Carrol Naish, who first has the original intention of frightening Mr. Dix to death. Along that line, the producers might have made a likely serio-comic film, but they change Mr. Naish's mind too quickly and send him—and the picture—in for a real kill. And so we get the routine spectacle of a dragged-out killer-and-victim chase, all very serious and phony—and, consequently, very dull. It ends with the killer being bumped off and Mr. Dix in a state of collapse."
More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a more favorable review, writing, "This action-packed one-hour mystery story was the first film in a series spun off from the successful radio program of the '30s and '40s. It starts off with some whistling and a monologue by the unseen Whistler, just as it was done on radio: 'I am the Whistler...and I know many things, for I walk by night.' ... This well-done suspense story continues with the panicky Earl trying to track down the killer to cancel the contract, while the killer thinks he can scare his target to death by just tailing him. The film's theme is that man cannot change his destiny, and if his destiny is to die by murder...that's what it will be. The Whistler states at the end: 'I know because I am the Whistler.' The result is an entertaining B film."
Film critic Leonard Maltin gave it three our of four stars, writing: "tense and moody tale of fate sets the ironic tone for the rest [of the Whistler series. Naish shines as the principal hit man."

Sun Stream

Sun Stream (1942–January 1959) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1945. The filly won five times from seven races in a track career which lasted from spring 1944 until June 1945. As a two-year-old in 1944 she won three races including the Queen Mary Stakes. After being beaten on her three-year-old debut she won the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and a substitute Oaks over one and a half miles at the same course a month later. After her second classic win she was retired to stud, where her record as a broodmare was disappointing.
Background.
Sun Stream was a chestnut mare with a white blaze and white hind feet. She was bred, like both her parents by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, the seven-time British flat racing Champion Owner. She was sired by Hyperion, who won the Epsom Derby and the St Leger Stakes for Lord Derby in 1933 and went on to become an internationally significant sire: Sun Stream's successes enabled Hyperion to claim the fourth of his six sires' championships in 1945. Sun Stream's dam, Drift, won four races including the Atalanta Stakes and became a successful broodmare, producing the 1000 Guineas winner Tideway and Heliopolis, a full brother to Sun Stream who was twice Leading sire in North America.
Lord Derby sent the filly to his private trainer Walter Earl at his Stanley House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.
Sun Stream's racing career took place during World War II during which horse racing in Britain was subject to many restrictions. Several major racecourses, including Epsom, Ascot and Doncaster, were closed for the duration of the conflict, either for safety reasons, or because they were being used by the military. Many important races were rescheduled to new dates and venues, often at short notice, and all five of the Classics were run at Newmarket.
Racing career.
1944: two-year-old season.
As a two-year-old in 1944, Sun Stream was among the best of her generation. She won the Bedford Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket in spring and then moved up in class for the Queen Mary Stakes in June. The race, traditionally part of the Royal Ascot meeting, was run at Newmarket from 1941 to 1944. Ridden by Harry Wragg, she won the race at odds of 100/30. In autumn, Sun Stream ran in the six furlong Cheveley Park Stakes, Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-old fillies. In a closely contested three-way finish she was beaten into third place by Sweet Cygnet and Neola. She was regarded as one of the best juvenile fillies to race in Britain in 1944.
1945: three-year-old season.
Sun Stream began her three-year-old season in the seven furlong Upwell Stakes, a now discontinued race which served as a trial for the 1000 Guineas, in which she finished second to Exotic. Two weeks later, on VE Day, Sun Stream started 5/2 favourite for the 1000 Guineas which, because of the war, was moved from its traditional venue on the Rowley Mile to the adjoining July course. Ridden by Wragg, she won by three lengths from Blue Smoke, with Mrs Feather a further two lengths back in third. Sun Stream's success gave Lord Derby a seventh win in the race as both owner and breeder, and was very popular with the unusually large crowd.
A month later, Sun Stream returned to the July course on 8 June for the Oaks Stakes. Although the race was not run at Epsom Downs Racecourse it was given its traditional name: wartime runnings at Newmarket had been known as the "New Oaks". The relaxation of wartime restrictions on transport resulted in a huge crowd converging on Newmarket, leading to serious traffic congestion at the course. She started the 6/4 favourite in a field of sixteen fillies. In what was described as "one of the most exciting classic finishes ever contested", Sun Stream won the race by a short head and three quarters of a length from the Aga Khan's Naishapur and Solar Princess. The veteran Harry Wragg was given a great deal of credit for the "mastery" he displayed in the race. She had a particularly hard race in the Oaks and did not compete again.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sun Stream a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the twenty-fifth best filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.
Stud record.
Sun Stream retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owner's stud. She produced four minor winners, but nothing of top class. Through her daughter Riviera, she was the female ancestor of the Champion Hurdler Collier Bay. Sun Stream was euthanised in January 1959.

Barry Railway Class D

Scandinavian Origins.
Barry Railway Class D were 0-8-0T steam tender engines of the Barry Railway in South Wales. They were built to a standard Sharp, Stewart and Company design modified by John Waddington Mann, the Chief Mechanical Engineer for the Swedish & Norwegian Railway. In fact, 20 of these locomotives were ordered by this railway. However the company ran into severe financial difficulty with the result that only one and a half locomotives were paid for by the S & N.
Barry Purchases.
Two of the locomotives, S&N 25 and 26, never reached overseas but were retained by Sharp, Stewart. They were later sold to the Barry Railway in October 1889 and became numbers 35 and 36. Two other locomotives, S&N 5 and 8, were seized by bailiffs in December 1891. There then followed a long drawn out legal dispute between Sharp, Stewart and Swedish & Norwegian Railway. It was not until May 1895 that the Supreme Court in Sweden found in favour of Sharp, Stewart and the engines in question were returned to the manufacturers. In late 1896, they were offered to the Barry Railway who took delivery of them in March and April 1897. The two locomotives were numbered 92 and 93.
Traffic Duties.
On arrival, the locomotives did very little main line duty but were confined to pulling heavy coal trains from Cadoxton Yard to Barry Docks. However in 1909, 92 and 93 were assigned to haul mineral trains from the coal pits on the Rhymney branch of the Brecon and Merthyr to Cadoxton Yard and were mechanically modified for the purpose.
Withdrawal.
The locomotives passed to the Great Western Railway in 1922 but were withdrawn between 1927 and 1930. None survived into British Railways ownership and none have been preserved.

Patrick Henry Building

The Patrick Henry Building is a historic building located in Richmond, Virginia. Formerly designated simply as the "Old State Library" or the "Virginia State Library and Archives and Virginia Supreme Court," it was renovated, then rededicated and renamed for the founding father and former Virginia Governor Patrick Henry on June 13, 2005.
Description.
The limestone-sheathed steel-core building was built in a modernist style for government buildings sometimes called Art-Deco or Stripped Classicism. The minimal exterior ornamentation was intended to direct attention to the nearby Virginia State Capitol. The two main entrances refer to its original two functions, as do the quotations from famous Virginians inscribed on the four sides (all-caps removed; periods for original colons):
The extensive 2003-2005 renovation retained the original entrances and many inside details (such as wood paneling, marble features and copper light fixtures), but modernized the plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems (removing hazardous materials). It also replaced the library stacks which had served as supportive core for the steel-frame building with modern core amenities. Some elements of the building's expansion in 1970 were also removed.
History.
Constructed by the Works Progress Administration during the New Deal, the building served as the home of the Virginia Supreme Court (formerly known as the Supreme Court of Appeals per the inscription above the Broad Street entrance) until it moved to the renovated former Federal Reserve Building in 1978. The entrance facing the Capitol refers to the Virginia State Library, now known as the Library of Virginia, which moved to a new building at Ninth and Broad Streets (as well as an offsite storage annex) in 1996. The Supreme Court and Library had moved from the Virginia State Library-Oliver Hill Building in 1939. This building's former reading rooms also temporarily housed Virginia General Assembly sessions in 2006 and 2007, during renovations to the Capitol.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, under its former name.
Current Use.
The building now houses the Governor's Working Office, offices of Cabinet Secretaries, Offices of the Department of Planning and Budget, and some DGS offices.

Abraham Senior

Abraham Senior or Abraham Seneor (Segovia 1412 - 1493) was a rabbi, banker and politician Spanish Jew, a senior member of the Castilian hacienda (almojarife of Castile or royal administrator), which in 1492 was converted to Roman Catholicism with the name Ferran, Fernan or Fernando Perez Colonel or Colonel Fernando Nunez, founding the noble lineage of the Colonel.
The Senior.
Senior family and its surroundings formed an important financial group from the 1460s got the main income tax lease of Crown of Castile, business where they remained for the rest of the century. The Senior family was also involved in politics, supporting to what some sources call a bourgeois party, defender of the interests of artisans cities of central Castile, governed by an urban patriciate from the lesser nobility and the bourgeoisie (as Segovia itself). In this group revealed the presence of a number of personal relationships Abraham Senior: his relative Andres Cabrera (steward of King Henry IV of Castile), Andrew's wife, Beatriz de Bobadilla (lady of the then Princess Elizabeth) and Alonso Quintanilla, Count of Accounts, which the infant Alfonso had entrusted the establishment of a mint in Medina del Campo (city enriched by the fairs). One consequence of the activity of this party was the creation of the Holy Brotherhood (1476) promoted by Quintanilla, from which Abraham Senior became treasurer in 1488.
Isabella Courtier.
His position at court was so important, it was not limited to his duties as collector's largest kingdom in 1469 intervened decisively in the negotiations for the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs in 1473 in the reconciliation between Isabel and her brother Henry IV, and in 1474 in delivering the Alcázar of Segovia (whose warden was Andres Cabrera). He reached a high level of confidence to Isabel, who, as queen, in gratitude for his important services, endowed him with a pension of 100,000 maravedis, confirmed in 1480 at the behest of the Real confessor Hernando de Talavera. He was appointed chief justice of the mosque (Jewish community) of Segovia (where he clashes with converted Jews and their families) 12 and " rab do the court "(" Rabbi "or" chief rabbi of Castile "); office which, like many of his predecessors, lacked appropriate qualifications from the point of view of religious orthodoxy of Judaism. She was so respected by the highest levels, that the Cortes of Toledo in 1480 he was presented with 50,000 maravedis from the revenues collected by itself. In the collection of taxes was associated with Isaac Abravanel, which became a close friend after having taken under his protection Abravanel be forced to leave Portugal in 1483. In the War of Granada played a valuable role both financial, and Abraham served as general-factor. They also took steps, initially unsuccessful, in favor of the proposed transatlantic expedition of Christopher Columbus.
Actively intervened in support of the cause of the Jewish community, under increasing pressure. Through their efforts, they managed to raise between Castilian aljamas a large sum to allow the Jews captured in Malaga making continuity in the exercise of their religion. At that time he was accused of having sold the jewels of the captive women to add that amount to the rescue. After getting delay a decision, long considered by kings, to expel the Jews from Spain and in view of the final publication of the Edict of Granada (31 March 1492), Abraham and Isaac Abravanel requested the repeal of the edict to change large sums of money, or some cause to be excluded. Given the refusal of the Queen, Senior (an old man of 80 years) chose conversion, while his friend Abravanel (65) chose to keep his religion and left for Naples.
Conversion of Abraham Senior major impact expected and responded to the political strategy of the Catholic Monarchs, so it was carefully staged, publicized and surrounded by all the solemnities, in a ceremony held on June 15, 1492 in the monastery of Guadalupe, 18 being the godparents of baptism both kings, and officiating the primate of Spain. From then took the Christian name of his godfather, Fernando (or Ferran Ferrad), and the surname Perez Nunez Colonel or Colonel (chosen extinct noble lineage Colonel's name, though some interpreted as a message crypto), along with the recognition of regions of known solar Hidalguía, exceptional. With Senior was named all his family, including his son was (according to other sources or his brother or his father) and Rabbi taxman Meir, Meir or Mayr Malamed. 
After conversion, whose sincerity was discussed, he took a few days charges ruler of Segovia, a member of the Royal Council and chief accountant of Prince Juan. During the expulsion continued to maintain a key financial role in relationships with the Jewish community who had to leave Spain to play a very restrictive economic legislation, so that in the following years the family of Colonel claimed and obtained kings charging substantial amounts originated in these operations (bankruptcies of Jews).
The Colonel.
The Colonel remained one of the most important families of Segovia in the sixteenth century. In 1493, the children of Abraham / Fernando, Juan Perez Colonel and Colonel Inigo Lopez, inherited his position in the business partnership with Luis de Alcalá and Mayr / Fernan. Inigo was also ruler of Segovia, and the lifting of the Communities was treasurer of the rebels. A daughter, Maria Coronel, had married in 1510 with Juan Bravo, the future leader segoviano commoner. 
A Pedro Fernandez Coronel, probably son of Fernan Nunez Coronel, participated in the second voyage of Columbus, who refers to him in glowing terms, and was appointed Constable of the Indies (with a salary of 15,000 maravedis a year). Back in Spain, he acted as a godfather at the baptism ceremony of the first Native American Indian giving his name to Peter (July 29, 1496, interestingly, in the same monastery of Guadalupe where he was baptized a few years before).
Abraham Senior's house in Segovia, in the Jewish quarter or neighborhood of the Colonel, who harbored even a synagogue-oratory, was converted into a convent of Franciscans in 1902, and currently houses the Educational Centre of the Jewish quarter. The Monastery El Parral still preserved the chapel of Calvary, Coronel family, with the tombs of Abraham / Fernando, his brother Paul Coronel (secretary of Cardinal Cisneros and professor of Hebrew at the University of Alcala, where he spoke at the Complutense Polyglot) and his granddaughter, Maria Coronel. Other prominent members of the family were Colonel Luis Nunez Coronel (nephew of Abraham, theologian, professor at the Sorbonne, Secretary of Alonso de Fonseca and friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam) and Paul Nunez Coronel (Sorbonne professor and rector of Montagut College, where he met Erasmus). Neighbor of the Colonel, and new Christian, was the outstanding physician Andrés Laguna.

Cuando en 1485 el converso Juan de Talavera fue recibido como escribano de la aljama, se opuso, y fue acusado por el hermano de éste (Yucé).

Llegado el asunto al Consejo de Castilla, se encargó al corregidor de Segovia que pusiera paz sin tomar al pie de la letra las acusaciones; se ignora si el asunto tuvo consecuencias inquisitoriales para Juan de Talavera.

Charlie Countryman

Charlie Countryman is a 2013 psychological romantic thriller directed by Fredrik Bond, written by Matt Drake, and starring Shia LaBeouf, Evan Rachel Wood, Mads Mikkelsen, Til Schweiger, and Melissa Leo. The film premiered on January 21, 2013 at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was screened in competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. The film was released November 15, 2013 in the United States and released on February 14, 2014 in the United Kingdom.
Plot.
Charlie Countryman (Shia LaBeouf) is a normal guy living in Chicago. When his mother (Melissa Leo) dies, he sees her as a spirit and, after asking her what do to with his life, tells him to go to Bucharest for adventure. On the flight, he meets Victor, an elderly man returning home from a Cubbies game, with a hat as a gift for his daughter. Later, Victor dies next to Charlie, who later sees him as a spirit, asking him to deliver his gift to his daughter, which he accepts. 
After arriving at the airport, he meets Victor's daughter, Gabi (Evan Rachel Wood), whom he falls instantly in love with. After he gives her Victor's gift, they part. While Charlie is riding in a taxi, he finds Gabi in her car on the side of the road, and she tells him that she can't keep up with the ambulance containing her father's body, and he offers to help catch up to them. They talk, with Gabi saying she plays the cello for the Bucharest opera house. They suddenly cause the ambulance truck to crash and flip over, with Victor's body flying out of it. Gabi leaves the area in another truck, leaving her car with Charlie. He takes the car to the opera house, not before finding a revolver in her bag. He takes her stuff into the opera house and later watches a performance with Gabi in it. Later on, Gabi meets her unstable and chaotic ex-husband, Nigel (Mads Mikkelsen) in a locker room. While they are talking, Gabi spots Charlie walking by, and Nigel questions him, causing Gabi to say that Charlie is a tuba player and is "homosexual". Gabi forces Nigel to leave, and he does so. Gabi then tells Charlie to go to a nearby hostel. 
Charlie arrives at the hostel and meets his roommates, Carl (Rupert Grint) and Luke (James Buckley). While they are partying, where Luke spikes Charlie's beer with Carpathian ecstasy, Charlie uses the bathroom and meets Nigel waiting to apologize to him for his behavior earlier, which Charlie accepts. He then sees Gabi walking, and they both go for a run to a nearby subway. After they stop by Victor's favorite cafe, they part, with Gabi telling him that if he finds her the next day, she will kiss him. Charlie, excited, ends up being hit by a car, and imagines Nigel being the one who hit him. It turns out to be a taxi driver who brings him to his hotel. The next day, Charlie wakes up to find out that Carl has taken too much Viagra and got an erection, and they go to a club for "medical help" for Carl's priapism. The trio are shocked with a bill they are given, and are taken to a room by security and meet Darko (Til Schweiger), a friend of Nigel who questions Charlie of his involvement with Gabi.
After they leave, he meets Gabi and her house for a party honoring Victor, and they go to a room for Gabi to share her kiss. He tells her about Darko, and she warns him of the kind of man he is. After everyone watches home videos of Victor, Nigel finds Charlie there and asks him personally to make his face look like a tuba player's face, and begins wondering if Charlie is really a tuba player. Gabi forces Nigel to leave with her revolver, and does so. After the guests leave, Gabi tells Charlie that she made the mistake of marrying Nigel; he was injured before they married, and he listened to the music she played at the cafe where she grew up playing. After he recovered, he told her that her music made him get better. She then realized that he was a cruel man, but it was too late. Her father (Victor) found a tape to use against Nigel to force him to leave the country, but that plan never worked out. Afterwards, Charlie confesses that he is in love with her, and they end up making love. He then tells her that his mother died, to which she responds that they finally "have something in common." 
The next morning, Charlie finds Gabi gone and finds a note telling him to not leave the house. Charlie finds a room filled with tapes, and finds the tape that was meant to be used against Nigel, containing footage of him killing everyone at a dinner table. Charlie then leaves and finds Gabi with Nigel at a restaurant and explains that he "saw the tape." Nigel then beats up Charlie to find out where the tape is, but doesn't. Once Nigel leaves him, the cops arrive and take Charlie away. The police tell him that Gabi doesn't want to see him anymore and that he will be taken to Budapest. He is taken to his hostel to get his belongings, but the hostel owner tells him that men were looking for him. When the men spot him, they chase Charlie to a subway, where he loses them. He returns to Gabi's home to look for the tape, and instead finds Darko there, showing him that Carl and Luke's backs are glued together. Gabi then calls Darko and talks about the tape, leaving Charlie injured.
Charlie waits for Gabi at the opera house, where she tells him that she doesn't want to see him again, and says goodbye. She goes to her car with Nigel, where it is revealed that they have the tape and Gabi had to tell Charlie what she said so life would go on. Charlie, saddened by what she said, once again sees his mother as a spirit, where she tells him that she is proud of him, and hopes he doesn't die, with Charlie saying if he does, he dies "for love." After his mother disappears, he runs to Gabi's car and pulls Nigel out in an attempt to escape. Charlie then attempts to fight him, only to have him knocked unconscious. He then wakes up above a lake hanging upside down by a rope. On a deck, Nigel burns the tape and prepares to shoot Charlie, only to have Gabi do it. She shoots his shirt to make it look like he's dead, and the cops arrive. Charlie is dropped into the lake, presumed dead by Gabi. Nigel commits suicide by cop. Charlie, to Gabi's delight, is revealed to be alive.
The film ends with Carl and Luke finally being separated from the super glue, and Charlie and Gabi finally together in a relationship.
Production.
In the early development, Shia LaBeouf dropped out of the project and the title role was briefly given to Zac Efron before LaBeouf returned to the project in August 2010.
Filming took place between May and June 2012 and filmed on location in Romania.
LaBeouf reportedly tripped on acid while filming acid scenes. According to LaBeouf, he had to trip on the acid to really get into the head of his character and to emulate some of his acting heroes. "There’s a way to do an acid trip like "Harold & Kumar" and there's a way to be on acid. What I know of acting, Sean Penn actually strapped up to that electric chair in "Dead Man Walking". These are the guys that I look up to."
Release.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 27% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4/10; the site's consensus reads: "Shia LaBeouf clearly relishes his role in Charlie Countryman, but his efforts can't salvage the movie's shallow script and overstuffed direction." Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, rated it 31/100 based on 20 reviews. John Anderson of "Variety" called it "a profoundly unnecessary film" with "strained attempts at magic realism". Justin Lowe of "The Hollywood Reporter" describe it as "an atmospheric feature that sets out to tackle big questions of love and destiny." Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" wrote, "this catastrophe of a movie zigzags drunkenly between action-adventure and surreal comedy with some magical realism slopped over it like ketchup." Robert Abele of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote, "Pulpy dross of surpassing dumbness, "Charlie Countryman" takes the blender approach to mixing dark adventure, doofus comedy and pie-eyed romance, but forgets to put the lid on when pulsed." Damon Wise of "Empire" gave a positive review, stating "Bond's use of music is excellent and his vision of eastern Europe both hellish and magical."

Cortinarius camphoratus

Cortinarius camphoratus, commonly known as the goatcheese webcap, is an agaric fungus in the family Cortinariaceae. The fungus is found in Europe and North America, where its fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow on the ground in a mycorrhizal association with spruce and firs in coniferous forests. Mushrooms are characterized by pale blue lilac colors when young, and a strong distinctive odor. Sources disagree as to the edibility of the mushroom, but they are generally not recommended for eating.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries under the name "Agaricus camphoratus" in his 1821 "Systema Mycologicum". In 1838 Fries transferred the species to "Cortinarius". Friedrich Otto Wünsche placed it in "Inoloma" in 1877. The specific epithet "camphoratus" refers to the odor resembling camphor. It is commonly known as the goatcheese webcap.
Description.
The fruit bodies of "Cortinarius camphoratus" have a cap that is initially convex before flattening out, sometimes developing a broad umbo; the diameter ranges from . Initially curled inwards, the cap margin uncurls as the mushroom matures. The cap, which is covered with minute fibers matted on the surface, is buff with tints of lilac, although golden tones typically develop in age. The flesh, colored lilac to purple, has no distinctive taste, and an odor that has been compared to "curry powder, rotting meat, old goats or goat's cheese, cold mashed potato, burnt horn, or sweaty feet." The gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe; they are initially pale lilac when young, but become rusty-brown as the spores mature. The stipe measures long by wide, and thickens towards the base. Roughly the same color as the cap, it is solid (i.e., not hollow), and covered with silky white matted fibrils up to the level of the annular zone. The latter feature is formed when the cobwebby white partial veil collapses on the stipe. There is general disagreement about the edibility of the mushroom: it has been described as edible, inedible, or somewhat poisonous. It is generally not recommended for consumption.
Mushrooms produce a rusty-brown spore print. The spores are pale brown, elliptical to slightly almond-shaped with minute, well-separated warts on the surface, and measure 8.5–11 by 5.5–6.5 μm. The cap cuticle is in the form of a cutis (with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface); the hyphae measure 3–8 μm wide.
Similar species.
The "gassy webcap", "Cortinarius traganus", is similar in appearance, and also has a pungent odor. A mildly poisonous species, it can be distinguished from "C. camphoratus" by the ochre or saffron-brown color of the gills, and the reddish-brown color of the stipe interior. "Cortinarius tasmacamphoratus" is a lookalike species found in Tasmania, Australia. It has a somewhat duller fruit body color, and gills that turn brown with age.
Habitat and distribution.
The species is found in Europe and North America, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with conifers, including firs but especially with spruce. Mushrooms are found on the ground growing singly, scattered, or in groups, usually between September and October.

Neilan and Mayer worked often together at this time, but after Mayer became head of MGM in 1924, the two had a falling out which revealed each man disliking the other fiercely. Neilan was vocal about his dislike of Mayer, which damaged his Hollywood career. Later, not finding work at the major studios, Neilan ended his career directing B movies.
Later, as head of MGM, Mayer had the film remade in 1927. In 1935, Will Rogers made a sound version at Fox.

Charles Henry (Cáthal Ainrí) Ó Néill

Cáthal Ainrí Ó Néill, or Charles Henry O'Neill, was the chieftain of the O'Neill dynasty of Clandeboye, (English - The O'Neill Clanaboy, Irish - An Ó Néill Buidhe), from 1855 until his death.
The son of Felix-Cunningham O'Neill, Esq., and Mary O'Neill, (who was the daughter of Bernard O'Neill of Ballygrooby and Dunmore and Mary the daughter of John O'Neill, Esq. of Muinterevelin in County Tyrone), Charles Henry was a Dublin Barrister, born at Feeva House in County Antrim near present day Toomebridge on 25 December 1809. He married Mary Adeline Louise O'Grady, daughter of James O'Grady, Esq. of the Dal Cassian family, and they had one child. He was the lineal descendant of the last Chieftain of Clanaboy, Briain mac Féilimh Ó Néill, through Briain's son and the last Tanaiste of Clanaboy, Con mac Briain Ó Néill. His daughter Elizabeth Catherine Mary Theresa was the last O'Neill of the Feeva to be born at Feeva House in 1845; which had been the home of this line since Con mac Briain's son Hugh Óge Ó Néill fought alongside Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and was dispossessed of the majority of his estates, and forced to leave Eden-duff-carrick settled in the adjoining lordship The Feeva.
From that time on Edendubhcarrig, later known as Shane's Castle, was in the hands of the descendants of Sir Henry Ó Néill who had converted to Anglicanism and conformed in Elizabethan times. In 1855, on the death of John O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill, who was predeceased by his elder brother Charles O'Neill, 1st Earl O'Neill, Sir Henry O'Neill's will entailed the Shane's Castle estate on the descendants of Con mac Briain Ó Néill; an event which signified the extinction of issue of his daughter Rose and heirs male in his own line. In a matter of great dispute, while Charles Henry became recognised as The O'Neill Clanaboy, John O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill was able to supersede the will by which he had inherited himself, and leave the Shane's Castle estate by his own will to William Chichester, who assumed the surname O'Neill and became William O'Neill, 1st Baron O'Neill.
Charles Henry was predeceased by his younger brother and assumed successor Louis Gordon O'Neill, and his only child Elizabeth married the Judge James Gervé Conroy and migrated to St. John's, Newfoundland in 1872.

British Eagle International Airlines Flight 802

On 29 February 1964, British Eagle International Airlines Flight 802 crashed into Glungezer Mountain near Innsbruck, Austria. The aircraft, a Bristol Britannia registered G-AOVO, had taken off from London Heathrow Airport, England, destined for Innsbruck Kranebitten Airport in Austria. All 75 passengers and 8 crew died in the crash.
The crash.
Flight 802 was an international scheduled passenger flight which took off from London Heathrow Airport at 12:04 p.m. bound for Innsbruck. The aircraft was a Bristol Britannia. At approximately 1:35 p.m., the flight crew contacted Munich Air Traffic control. Nine minutes later the pilot of Flight 802 changed flight plans from Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to Visual Flight Rules (VFR). Innsbruck had no instrument approach procedures and "Flight" described it as "generally regarded as one of the most difficult airports in Europe". As they passed over Innsbruck VHF omnidirectional range station, the aircraft was still unable to break through the clouds. Snow flurries were falling. 
At 2:12 p.m., the crew of Flight 802 reported that were at . This was the last communication received from the aircraft. Several minutes later, Flight 802 flew into the eastern slope of Glungezer Mountain at a height of approximately . Everyone on board the aircraft, most of whom were Britons on a ski holiday, were killed in the crash.
Aftermath.
An avalanche caused crash debris to move approximately 400 metres downhill. Due to the weather and light, the crash site was not found by aircraft until the day after. The recovery of the bodies and wreckage was hampered by the location which was accessible only by helicopter. 
The British government made a protest when the Austrian authorities made a preliminary statement three days after the incident before the enquiry had barely started and the BALPA journal criticized a statement from the airport that their equipment was working and not the cause of the accident.
The crash of British Eagle International Airlines Flight 802 is the worst aviation disaster in Austrian history.
Cause.
It was concluded that the pilot of Flight 802 had intentionally descended below the minimum safe altitude of in an attempt to penetrate the overcast. Just before the crash, the crew was flying without visual contact of the ground in violation of Austrian regulations concerning Innsbruck Kranebitten Airport. Despite the weather, other aircraft were operating in and out of Kranebitten Airport and this may have been a factor in why 802's pilot decided to continue the descent

Bill Belton

William Earl "Bill" Belton II (born February 2, 1993) is an American football running back who plays for the Penn State Nittany Lions. He is currently the starter at tailback after senior Silas Redd transferred to USC amidst sanctions from the NCAA in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. He was an all-state quarterback at Winslow Township High School where he played for Mike McBride.
Early years.
Belton was born in 1993 in Sicklerville, New Jersey. He attended Winslow Township High School where he played quarterback and was named all state in New Jersey. He was the first player in New Jersey history to record two consecutive seasons of 2000 passing yards and 1000 rushing yards.
College career.
2011.
Belton was a significant component to the offense in his freshman season, working primarily out of the "Wildcat" formation. He totaled 65 rushing yards on 13 carries in 8 games. His best game of the year came in the TicketCity Bowl where he carried the ball 6 times for 35 yards. He was one of only four true freshman to receive significant playing time.
2012.
Coming into spring practice, Belton was expected to back up Silas Redd and provide an occasional change of pace. But when Redd transferred to USC in wake of sanctions against the Penn State program, Belton was named the starter. In Penn State's first game against the Ohio Bobcats, Belton carried the ball 13 times for 55 yards. Belton missed the next two games against Virginia and Navy respectively due to an ankle injury. He was expected to return against Temple on September 22, but once again sat out. On Twitter, Belton suggested he would return for the game against Illinois saying "Time for Illinois. Guess who's backkkk". Though Belton did return for the game against Illinois, he has since taken a back seat to running back Zach Zwinak. In the game against Northwestern, Belton recorded only 4 carries for 12 yards, while Zwinak totaled 28 carries for 121 yards and a touchdown. Bill Belton played his best game of the season on October 20 against Iowa. He rushed 16 times for 103 yards and 3 touchdowns.
Belton was benched by coach Bill O'Brien against Purdue on November 3 after having a poor week of practice. Teammate Zach Zwinak played instead and posted a 21 rush for 134 yard stat line.

Eugeniusz Geno Malkowski

Eugeniusz Geno Małkowski (; 5 September 1942) is a Polish artist and painter, professor of UWM in Olsztyn, founder of artistic groups and associations, modern art exhibition organizer and art popularizer. He is known for his speed painting happenings and actions in which he invites people to paint together. In 2005 in Belchatow he beat the Guinness World Record for the 24-hour-long-painting performance.
Biography.
He was born in Gdynia. After World War II his family moved to Lębork where he spent his childhood. He started artistic education in 1957 at Graphical Secondary School in Wrocław and continued studying at Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw with the professors Juliusz Studnicki and Artur Nacht-Samborski.
In 1969 he founded the artistic group "Arka" and in 1972 he transformed it into a bigger generational movement (80 creators) known by the name "O Poprawę" (For the Enhancement) with which he organized 9 group expositions. In the 1980s he co-founded the multidisciplinary art group "Świat" (World) and organized 18 group expositions. In the 1990s he passed several years in France where he founded the artistic association "ARA" (Association for Renovation of Art) and organized several group exhibitions of modern Polish art.
Between 1991 and 2012 he has been working as a Professor of Art at UWM in Olsztyn.
Since 1990 he has organized many happenings popularizing modern art among non specialized public. He has practiced speed and time painting and invited spectators to paint with him at informal places, such as commercial centers or streets. The works created in such a way were later exhibited in art galleries.
In 2005 in Belchatow he beat the Guinness World Record for the 24-hour-long-painting. He painted 100 works measuring 80 cm x 100 cm based on previously performed sketches.
He lives and works in Warsaw and in Olsztyn. He has had more than 50 solo shows of his works and he has participated in over 200 group exhibitions. His paintings are held by major museums of Poland (i.a. National Museum in Warsaw, National Museum in Gdańsk, Toruń Regional Museum), as well as by private collectors in Poland and all around the world.
Work and style.
At the beginning of his career he reinvented graffiti technique applying it with stencil brushes on canvas, in a method known as tapping. In his early paintings he was depicting fantastical and heavenly backgrounds populated with stenciled human profiles, transparent spheres or outlined hands. Later he added some other irregular forms tending towards the lyrical abstraction. The names of his works were metaphorically commenting his reality (cycles: «Wielki Świat» (The Big World), «Krzyk» (Shout) or «Exodus»).
In the 1980s he introduced figurative elements and started experimenting with space division of art work (cycle «Obszary» (Territories)). Furthermore, he implemented collage techniques mixing them up with graffiti (cycle «Współcześni» (Contemporaries)).
In the 1990s he abandoned tapping replacing it with so-called speed painting techniques. He became closer to the basis of abstract expressionism reproducing persons or situations in a spontaneous, automatic and almost subconscious way.
In the first decade of 21st century he moved back to the graffiti technique superposing multicolor stencils of human shapes on monochromatic background (cycle «Pokolenia» (Generations)).
In 2010 in Olsztyn he exhibited a series of 44 female nudes painted in several short sessions mixing up speed painting and realistic techniques. The last nude was painted by the artist in public exhibition during the opening day.

S v Zuma and Others was the first case decided by the Constitutional Court of South Africa after it was established in 1995. The case dealt with a provision of the Criminal Procedure Act which required the defence in criminal cases to prove that a confession made before a magistrate was coerced, rather than requiring the state to prove that it was not coerced. The court held that this reverse onus provision was unconstitutional because it violated the right to a fair trial under section 25 of the Interim Constitution.

Izzi Top

Izzi Top is a British Thoroughbred racehorse. In a career which lasted from October 2010 until October 2012 she ran twelve times and won six races. As four-year-old in 2012 she won two Group One races- the Pretty Polly Stakes in Ireland and the Prix Jean Romanet in France.
Background.
Izzi Top is a bay mare bred by the Meon Valley Stud in Hampshire. Her dam, Zee Zee Top was another product of the Meon Valley Stud who won the Group One Prix de l'Opera in 2003. Like many horses bred at the stud, she raced in the black and white colours of Helena Springfield Ltd. She was sired by the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Pivotal, who has sired the winners of 24 Group One races including Somnus, Sariska, Farhh, Excellent Art and Immortal Verse.
Racing career.
Izzi Top made her debut in a maiden race for two-year-old fillies at Doncaster Racecourse. She started a 33/1 outsider and finished second.
In April 2011 Izzi Top won a maiden race at Windsor Racecourse but was later disqualified when a prohibited substance was detected in a post-race sample. In May she finished third in a ten furlong race at Newmarket and then won a Listed race over the same distance at Newbury Racecourse. In June she started a 25/1 outsider for the Epsom Oaks but exceeded expectations by finishing third to Dancing Rain. Izzi Top's only other appearance of the season came more than four months later in the Group Three Prix de Flore at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. She started the 3.1/1 favourite and won by a head from Albaraah.
In May 2012, Izzi Top won the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket and the Middleton Stakes at York in May. In July she was sent to Ireland to contest the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh. She won her fourth consecutive Group Race comfortably by one and a quarter lengths from the odds-on favourite Sapphire. On 4 August at Goodwood Racecourse, Izzi Top started favourite for the Group One Nassau Stakes but was badly hampered in the final furlong and finished sixth of the eight runners behind her three-year-old stable companion The Fugue. Two weeks after her run at Goodwood, Izzi Top finished second to Snow Fairy in the Prix Jean Romanet at Deauville Racecourse, but was later awarded first place when the winner failed a post-race test. On her final appearance, Izzi Top finished second to Ridasiyna when favourite for the Prix de l'Opera.

The Fugue

The Fugue (foaled 16 March 2009) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse who was named European Champion three-year-old filly at the Cartier Racing Awards. The Fugue won her only race as a two-year-old in 2011, before developing into one of the best fillies in Europe in the following season. She won the Musidora Stakes at York and the Nassau Stakes and was considered an unlucky loser in both the Oaks Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. In 2013 The Fugue won the Yorkshire Oaks before recording her biggest win in the Irish Champion Stakes. Since then, she has travelled to California to compete for a second time at the Breeders' Cup, in which she came second in the Turf.
Background.
The Fugue is a dark bay or brown filly with a white star and stripe and white socks on her hind legs bred by her owner, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Watership Down stud. She was sired by Dansili, whose other progeny have included the leading middle distance winners Harbinger and Rail Link. The Fugue's dam, Twyla Tharp, won only one minor race but was a half sister to the Eclipse Stakes winner Compton Admiral and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Summoner. The filly was sent into training with John Gosden at his Clarehaven Stables at Newmarket.
Racing career.
2011: two-year-old season.
The Fugue made her first appearance in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 October 2011. Ridden by Robert Havlin, she was poorly supported in the betting and started at odds of 14/1 in a field of twelve two-year-old fillies. She started slowly and was towards the rear of the field in the early stages before making progress to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Salacia.
2012: three-year-old season.
The Fugue made her first appearance of 2012 in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 6 May. Starting at odds of 22/1 she finished fourth of the sixteen runners behind Homecoming Queen. Two weeks later the filly was then moved up in distance for the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Ridden by William Buick, she took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew clear of her five opponents to win "very readily" by four and a half lengths.
On 1 June The Fugue was made 11/4 favourite for the 234th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The filly fought against Buick's attempts to restrain her in the early stages and turned into the straight in ninth place. She made steady progress in the closing stages to finish third of the twelve runners, beaten a neck and half a length by Was and Shirocco Star. The "Daily Express" described her as a "desperately unlucky" loser. On her next appearance, The Fugue started favourite for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot, but proved no match for the Dermot Weld-trained filly Princess Highway, who beat her into second place by six lengths. In August, The Fugue was brought in distance to contest the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which her rivals included Was, Nahrain and her stable companion Izzi Top. With Buick being advised by Gosden to ride the 7/4 favourite Izzi Top, The Fugue was ridden by Richard Hughes and started at odds of 11/4. Held up towards the rear of the field, The Fugue accelerated in the straight to take the lead fifty yards from the finish and won by a length from Timepiece. Hughes said of The Fugue's performance that "the more I held her back, the more I knew she was going to really go." Nineteen days later The Fugue moved back up in distance for the Yorkshire Oaks and finished second to the French-trained four-year-old Shareta, with Was in third and Shirocco Star in fourth.
On her final race of the season The Fugue was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. Ridden by Buick, she started the 11/8 favourite against ten opponents. Buick struggled to find racing room and had to switch the filly several times inside the closing stages before obtaining a clear run. The Fugue finished strongly but finished an "unlucky" third behind Zagora and Marketing Mix.
2013: four-year-old season.
According to Gosden, The Fugue did not thrive during the cold winter and spring of 2012/2013, and she did not appear until June, when she took on a field including Camelot, Al Kazeem, Maxios and Red Cadeaux in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Buick, she made steady progress in the straight to finish third of the eleven runners behind Al Kazeem and Mukhadram. The Fugue met Al Kazeem and Mukhadram again in the Eclipse Stakes on 6 July, but ran disappointingly to finish last of the seven runners. A subsequent examination suggested that the filly was suffering from a respiratory infection.
In August The Fugue ran against all-female competition for the first time in 2013 when she started the 2/1 favourite for the Yorkshire Oaks. Buick sent her into the lead approaching the final furlong and she drew away from the field to win by four lengths from the Irish-trained Venus de Milo. Gosden expressed his satisfaction with the filly's recovery and nominated the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Breeders' Cup as future targets. On 7 September, The Fugue was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse and started at odds of 4/1 in a field which included Al Kazeem, Trading Leather and Kingsbarns. Buick settled the filly in fourth place as Trading Leather set a strong pace, before moving to the outside to make a challenge in the straight. The Fugue took the lead approaching the final furlong and won comfortably by one and a quarter lengths from Al Kazeem. After the race Buick said: "She's one of the greats now. She's always been special and has always been a special one for everybody in the yard. She's very good and has arguably beaten the best around at the moment."
The Fugue made her final appearance of the year in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. Ridden by Buick, she started the 6/4 favourite ahead of the leading North American turf performers Point of Entry, Little Mike and Big Blue Kitten. The filly settled behind the leaders before moving up to take the lead in the straight. She looked the likely winner but was caught in the final strides and beaten half a length by the Irish-trained three-year-old Magician.
Assessment and honours.
In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, The Fugue was given a rating of 116 making her the 170th best racehorse in the world and the tenth-best three-year-old filly. At the Cartier Racing Awards, The Fugue was named Champion three-year-old filly, despite being rated below Valyra, Ridasiyna, Beauty Parlour, Great Heavens and Princess Highway in the official ratings.
Pedigree.
The Fugue was bred by Watership Down Stud (Simon Marsh).

KRFE

KRFE is a radio station licensed to Lubbock, Texas, broadcasting on 580 AM. The station airs an easy listening music format.
KRFE AM was previously KDAV AM, KRLB AM and KJBX AM.
Formats have included Country, Pop, ABC Stardust, R&B/Rap, and Hot A/C 
In 1953, KDAV was a 500 watt daytimer on 580 kHz that began at 66th and Quirt Avenue (today known as 6602 Martin Luther King). That station was founded by Elmore, Worley and David Pinkston. 
KDAV 580 became KRLB in 1979. It added an FM at 99.5 (KWGO-FM, then KRLB-FM, then KCRM-FM, now KQBR-FM HD1). 
Ownership of this station changed many times over the decades, various partners came and went. In 1975, 49% of the station was sold to "Mexican American Services,Inc" for 60,000 dollars. A couple of years later (1977) the other 51% was sold for another 60,000 dollars. The former 99.5 KWGO, now KQBR, was sold to KRLB, Inc (Ed WIlkes, owner of AM 580 KRLB) in 1980 for 380,000 dollars. In 1983 KRLB Inc. was sold to Ken Dowe. Dowe owned several stations throughout Texas, and had made himself a name in radio during 20 years with Gordon McClendon's KLIF 1190 in Dallas. Dowe continued co-ownership of KRLB AM/FM (KRLB AM LATER KJBX AM) until the mid '90s when it was sold to South Plains Broadcasting. At that time South Plains Broadcasting had no interest in AM 580 and would sell the station back to "Big" Ed Wilkes, who was a prior owner. Wade Wilkes is the current owner and general manager of KRFE AM Inc.

Scabs (Hell on Wheels)

"Scabs" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American television drama series "Hell on Wheels", which aired on September 2, 2012 on AMC. The fourteenth episode of the series is written by Catherine Hardwicke and directed by Chris Mundy. In the episode, the Sioux torture a railroad worker, causing the crews to strike. Cullen (Anson Mount) telegraphs for replacement workers ("scabs"), forcing the crews to band together and save their jobs. Eva (Robin McLeavy) tells both Elam (Common) and Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) that she is pregnant with Elam's baby.
Plot.
The railroad construction gets further into dangerous territory as screams are heard near a cutting site. The Sioux are torturing Fleming (Evan Hall), the railroad's sentry. Staying just outside their gun range, Cullen aims a rifle and shoots Fleming dead. The Sioux disperse. Back at camp, Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) begs bartender Carl (James Dugan) for a drink. Cullen buys Cole a round and asks him to read a eulogy for Fleming, but Cole explains Ruth (Kasha Kropinski) is now over the church and he sleeps in the cemetery. Cullen offers to let Cole stay in his caboose.
Outside, the railroad crew returns early. Cullen orders them back to work but Toole refuses out of concern for their safety. Cullen threatens to make it unsafe for them at the camp if they do not get back to work, but Toole stands his ground. In the railway office, Lily (Dominique McElligott) recommends to Durant (Colm Meaney) that they reroute the railroad to bypass Sioux sacred land. Cullen takes the opposite opinion, claiming the Sioux will always be a threat and that it's better to fight them now rather than later.
Eva tells Elam that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he is initially upset, he later professes his love to her. Elam tries to give Eva money so that she can get an abortion, fearing that Toole would kill her and the baby if he found out, but she does not accept the money. At the saloon, the crewmen hold a wake for Fleming, where they honor him with song and drink. Cullen enters to pay his respects and to urge the men back to work. Psalms (Dohn Norwood) and the Freedmen arrive and offer to protect the railroad from the Sioux if they are armed with rifles. The room erupts in objections and Cullen says Durant would never arm ex-slaves. Psalms and Toole declare a strike until their demands are met.
The next day, the town burns an effigy of Durant in the street. Durant orders Cullen to resolve the situation, giving him complete authority. Watching the bonfire, Elam warns Psalms that the Freedmen will get themselves killed "playing" with guns. Psalms counters that they will never be seen as equals unless they are holding weapons. Toole comes home and drunkenly gropes Eva. She gently pushes him away, announcing that she is pregnant and that it is not his. He grabs his bag and leaves. Cullen telegraphs a message to Council Bluffs, Iowa requesting 200 replacement workers. Elam predicts bloodshed, and tells Cullen that he will not clean up after Cullen's mess. Cullen says Elam will do whatever Durant tells him to.
Outside his tent with Reverend Cole, the Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) prophesies a war. He yanks Cole's liquor bottle away from him, telling him that he needs to see things clearly and they must decide which side they are on. In the street that night, Elam threatens to kill Toole if he hurts Eva. Toole, having by now figured out that Elam is the father of Eva's baby, counters that Elam is a neither a "real man" nor a "real father", and that he is just a coward. The train with the replacement workers arrives. Toole and his men exit the bar as the train stops. Cullen and Elam watch as the railroad crews attack their replacements. Toole and Psalms unite in the fight and together drive the new crewmen back onto the train as it departs. Toole finds Cullen at the saloon and agrees to send his men back to work if the Freedmen protect them — with guns. Cullen joins Elam at his table and tells him to get the Freedmen back to work. When Elam protests, Cullen compares the men to horses, saying there is no sense in having a horse unless it is "broke enough to ride." Elam objects to the comparison, but Cullen simply reminds him that he works for Durant now. 
The next day, Elam tells the Freedmen to either get back to work or go back to prison. Psalms challenges him and they fight. Elam repeatedly punches Psalms in the kidneys, hurting him badly, but Psalms eventually knocks Elam out. At the railway office, Cullen tells Durant that the strike is over if he can arm the Freedmen. Durant concedes, although Lily still objects to passing through Sioux sacred land. Toole returns home, crawls into bed next to Eva and tenderly touches her belly, softly telling her that her husband has returned home. Cullen arrives at his caboose to find Cole packing up. Cole says that he cannot stay with him because Cullen believes the Sioux are their enemy. Cullen says that he respects his statement. He later distributes guns to the Freedmen and then instructs them on how to load and shoot rifles. As Durant and Lily watch the Freedmen guard the cut, Cullen tells Psalms to shoot anything that moves.
Reception.
Ratings.
"Scabs" was watched by 2.47 million viewers and received a 0.6 rating among viewers aged 18-49.
Critical reception.
The episode received positive reviews. "The A.V. Club"s Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a B- grade, stating: "It took a season and a half, but "Hell On Wheels" has finally gone ahead and told a story that's actually, properly about building a railroad. Even more promisingly, the episode that does so places ... all the focus on the two protagonists, Cullen and Elam." Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated "Scabs" with 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "a fine episode", but added that "it wasn't nearly as exciting or memorable" as "Slaughterhouse".

Libros del saber de astronomía

The Libros del saber de astronomía del rey Alfonso X de Castilla (Books of wisdom of astronomy of King Alfonso X of Castile) is a literary work of the medieval period, composed during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile. It is a description of celestial bodies and the astronomical instruments existing at the time. The collection is a group of treatises on astronomical instruments (celestial sphere, spherical and plane astrolabe, saphea, and universal plate for all latitudes) for measurements or uranography or star cartography that can be used for casting horoscopes. The purpose of the rest of the instruments (quadrant of the type called vetus, sundial, clepsydras) is to determine the time, which was also needed to cast the horoscope. The king looked for separate works for the construction and use of each device. [http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Alfonso_X_BEA.htm
Of the three scientific collections Alfonso X commissioned between 1276 and 1279, this is the only one that has come down to us with the full original text intact. It is a group of technical treatises, except for the first one, which is a description of the contents of the other treatises. The books are:

Smoke (1/3)

Smoke is a large-scale sculpture conceived by American artist Tony Smith in 1967 that was fabricated posthumously in 2005 for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) where it was installed in 2008. This two-tier sculptures standing 24 foot tall is made of aluminum and painted black.
Location history.
"Smoke" is unique in that it is Smith’s only large-scale work specifically intended for an interior space. The first iteration of the sculpture was a painted plywood version installed in the atrium of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C. in 1967. This version, measuring 45 feet long, 33 feet wide, and 22 feet high, was based on Smith's small-scale cardboard model, and was built and painted by three to seven workmen over the course of two months, at a cost of $6,000. LACMA’s painted aluminum version was installed in 2008 and the first in an edition of three; second in the edition is in a private collection. 
Art historian Joan Pachner described the artwork as one that does not have a single focal point or axis: "it looks like a complicated jungle gym. Interior views are dominated by the linear scaffold and the implied infinite expanse of the design." 
The sculpture has been on permanent view in the Ahmanson Building Room at LACMA since 2008.
Acquisition.
Smoke was acquired by LACMA in 2010 (as accession number M.2010.49) through a gift from the Belldegrun Family in honor of Rebecka Belldegrun's birthday

Kimberly Rivera

Kimberly Rivera (born c. 1982) is an Iraq war resister and former U.S. Army Private First Class who went AWOL in February 2007 after a year of service. She was the first female U.S. military deserter to flee to Canada. She was deported from Canada on September 20, 2012 and pled guilty to desertion, receiving a sentence of ten months' imprisonment and a bad-conduct discharge. Amnesty International objected to her detention and designated her a prisoner of conscience.
Background and military service.
A long-time resident of Mesquite, Texas, Rivera worked at Walmart prior to her military service, meeting her future husband Mario there. After she and Mario married, they agreed that one of them should join the army for financial reasons, but both were initially too overweight for the army's requirements. Because Rivera shed the weight faster, she enlisted instead of her husband, signing with the U.S. Army in January 2006 for an $8000 bonus.
She served her first tour of duty in Iraq starting in October of that year and worked primarily as a gate guard. She soon became disillusioned with the mission, later stating that she was particularly influenced by seeing a crying two-year-old Iraqi girl coming with her family to claim compensation for bombing by coalition forces. On another occasion, Rivera claims to have returned to her bunk to find a piece of shrapnel in it. Though she had been initially interested in supporting democracy for the Iraqi people, she stated that she felt she found only "lies" in Iraq and felt betrayed by the U.S. government.
Flight to Canada.
While on leave in early 2007, from which she was supposed to return to her deployed unit, she and her husband made contact with the Toronto-based War Resisters Support Campaign, and on February 18, 2007, fled across the border to Canada with their children. Rivera then applied for refugee status.
In January 2009, the Immigration and Refugee Board ruled that Rivera must leave the country by the end of the month. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney described Rivera and other U.S. military deserters as "bogus claimants" for refugee status, calling them "people who volunteer to serve in the armed forces of a democratic country and simply change their mind to desert. And that's fine, that's the decision they have made, but they are not refugees." MPs of the Liberal-NDP coalition responded that their parties would refuse to deport military deserters if they assumed power, while Lee Zalofsky of the War Resisters Support Campaign stated that Kenney's remark showed the ministry as biased and unwilling to hear cases in a "fair and impartial manner". Rivera appealed the decision.
Deportation, arrest and court-martial.
In August 2012, five years after her arrival in Canada, Rivera received another deportation order, ordering her to return to the United States by September 20, 2012. Amnesty International stated that it considered Rivera a conscientious objector and would consider her a prisoner of conscience if she were detained. On September 20, 2012, Rivera presented herself at the U.S. border. Upon her return to the U.S., she was arrested and transferred to military custody.
Subsequent to a plea agreement between Rivera and U.S. military authorities, a sentencing hearing was held April 29, 2013 at Fort Carson, Colorado. After pleading guilty, she was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment and given a bad-conduct discharge.
Rivera submitted a request to the convening authority requesting an early release from prison, so that she would be able to stay with her newborn son (born November 25, 2013 at Balboa Naval Medical Center). This request was rejected on November 27. Supporters of Rivera have called for an "International Day of Action" on December 1, which will include demonstrations and vigils outside military installations and US consulates.
Two days after giving birth to her fifth child, Rivera was separated from the child and returned to prison from the hospital to serve the remainder of her sentence. 
On 28 November her clemency request for a 45-day reduction of her 10-month sentence was denied by Fort Carson Senior Commander Brigadier General Michael A. Bills. 
On 12 December, 2013, Kimberly Rivera was released from the Miramar military confinement facility in San Diego, California on the grounds of good behavior and for the performance of extra word duties, including crocheting blankets for wounded veterans.
Family.
At the time of Rivera's deportation from Canada, Kimberly and Mario Rivera had four children. Their two eldest children were born in the U.S., and the two youngest in Canada.
Rivera's fifth child, Matthew Kaden, was born on November 25, 2013, while Rivera was in U.S. military confinement.

W255CJ

W255CJ FM 98.9 is a 250-watt, class-D, radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, airing an Oldies format known as Oldies 98.9. 
Operation.
Facility.
The station's city of license was previously Tallapoosa (west of metro Atlanta), which is now far beyond its current broadcast range, nearly in Alabama. The station's current facility was a move-in in 2011. Previously, it was most recently programmed as 99X, which originally began on full-power station WNNX (now WWWQ) FM 99.7 in 1992, then reappeared on W250BC FM 97.9, before moving to this station in June 2011, which was then followed by active rock "98.9 The Bone" in September 2012, and Christian AC/Country "98.9 The Walk" in February 2013".
Power and range.
It has a power of 250 watts but at great height, and is transmitted from a "broadcast translator" on the WWWQ FM 99.7 radio tower near North Druid Hills, along with several other stations. It has the same height and coordinates as W250BC 97.9 and W229AG 93.7, indicating that it likely shares an antenna with them via a combiner. While on 99.1 at 99 watts as W256BO, it had a broadcast range of approximately , only somewhat less than the two other stations, which are at 250 watts. 
On 99.1, the station had to maintain lower power and a slightly directional antenna due partly to WDEN-FM 99.1 in Macon, which often caused RF interference with the station, particularly early on calm mornings due to overnight temperature inversions that enhance radio propagation. It was required to run at less than 100 watts due to the proximity of WRAS FM 88.5, since the intermediate frequency (IF) of 10.7 MHz used in radio tuners puts the station's IF at 88.4, overlapping the lower half of 88.5's channel. For its initial two weeks on 99.1, the station was required to run at half power due to testing required for all new directional antenna installations. 
Even after going to full power, the station lost half its over-the-air listeners because of this, so in July 2011, it applied to change one channel down to 98.9 and increase to 250 watts using the same antenna. Two months later, it received its permit and made the switch to the new frequency in mid September. Interference is now mostly on the opposite side of the metro area due to co-channel WWGA FM 98.9 to the west in Tallapoosa (where what is now W255CJ once had its city of license), and WNGH-FM 98.9 (Georgia Public Broadcasting) to the northwest in Chatsworth. Likewise, W255CJ makes it impossible to hear those stations in metro Atlanta anymore.
Circumventing translator restrictions.
Legally, the station acts as a "translator" for WWWQ, under a low-power broadcast license system intended to allow main stations to be heard in areas where terrain (or great distance to isolated rural communities) blocks their signal. In this case, the "translator" is instead on the same tower as its parent station where the signal is already extremely strong, and broadcasts programming that cannot otherwise be heard except for the extremely limited number of those receivers equipped with the proprietary digital radio system. (Although translators are prohibited from carrying their own programming, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allows stations to ignore this if they are simulcasting an HD Radio channel of the parent station on analog FM, also allowing them to circumvent caps intended to prevent excessive concentration of media ownership.)
Various Frequencies and callsigns.
The station's facility has been through numerous channel changes, requiring it to change broadcast callsigns each time, since translators have the channel number included in their callsigns. These past callsigns and frequencies and their official callsign start dates are:
The frequencies from late 2006 to mid-2010 are in the reserved band (88 to 92 MHz), indicating it must have rebroadcast a noncommercial educational station at the time. Prior to each callsign change, the station may have been broadcasting on the frequency under program test authority allowed by its construction permit.
Like 99X's former home on W250BC, W255CJ is owned by Cumulus Media, after their acquisition of Susquehanna Broadcasting. WWWQ and WNNX are also under the same ownership. , the FCC still lists W250BC as rebroadcasting parent station WNNX FM ("Rock 100.5" in analog and HD1, previously no HD2). That station forced two other LPFM stations (like W250BC and W255CJ) permanently off-air when it moved to Atlanta as WWWQ in 2001: WGHR at Southern Polytechnic State University, and W264AE from Georgia Public Broadcasting.
After the 2011 purchase of Citadel Broadcasting, its sister stations in Atlanta now include WKHX-FM 100.5 and WYAY FM 106.7, in addition to previous Cumulus holdings WWWQ FM 99.7, WNNX FM 100.5, and W250BC FM 97.9.
History.
Previously home of the legendary 99X (after it was moved off of their original home at 99.7 FM/HD1 in 2008, then resurrected on W250BC FM 97.9 in 2009, and moved to 99.1 and then 98.9 in 2011), the station began a new incarnation as active rocker "98-9 The Bone" on September 1, 2012, at Noon. The first song on "The Bone" was "Warrior's Call" by Volbeat. The station displaced 99X after nearly a year run on the 98.9 frequency. 99X was less than two months away from its 20th anniversary on October 26.
The Bone was born after longtime active-rock station "Project 9-6-1" (WKLS FM 96.1) flipped to top 40 three days earlier. The huge protest that arose because of the flip prompted Cumulus Media to resurrect the format on one of their stations, in this case, 98.9. The new format sounds like a cross between alternative 99X and hard-rock Project 9-6-1. Unlike most format flips, the 99X staff was not immediately fired, indicating there may be a future for it, possibly on another Cumulus station, pending an announced flip to sports radio of CBS Radio's alternative "Dave FM" (WZGC FM 92.9) in October 2012.
On January 28, 2013, W255CJ and sister station WNNX ("Rock 100.5") began promoting changes to the two stations on their Facebook and Twitter pages, hinting a "bigger and better change" to come February 1. The rumors that state the announcements are a possible merger of the two formats on one frequency, presumably on 100.5, was confirmed two days later, and took place at Midnight, when 98.9 and 100.5 began simulcasting (the final song on "The Bone" was "Self Esteem" by The Offspring). At 10 AM, 100.5 relaunched with a full-fledged active rock format. The simulcast ended on February 4 at 10 AM; following a two-hour stunt of clips of songs with "Walk" in the title, the station flipped to a country-leaning Christian AC, branded as "The Walk." The first song on "The Walk" was "For The Grace of God" by Keith Urban.
On August 25, 2013, 4 websites were registered that would signify a format change to classic hits as "98.9 The True Oldies Channel," "The True Oldies Channel 98.9", "Atlanta's True Oldies 98.9", or "Oldies 98.9". This would be the third format change on 98.9 in a calendar year, and would bring the oldies format back to Atlanta after WYAY dropped it for all-news in May of 2012. On August 26th, at 11:00 AM, the station began stunting with songs from the 1960s with the word "Walk" in the title. One hour later, the station relaunched as "True Oldies 98.9", launching with "Jumping Jack Flash" by the Rolling Stones.
On June 28, 2014 W255CJ switched from The True Oldies Channel to Westwood One's "Good Time Oldies" format.

Medical Missionaries of Mary

The Medical Missionaries of Mary are a religious institute of the Catholic Church dedicated to providing health care to the underdeveloped regions of the world. They follow a Benedictine spirituality, with its focus on life in community, shared prayer and hospitality.
Founded in Ireland in 1937 by Mother Mary Martin, they were originally dedicated to serve the missions in Africa. Today they serve in both North and South America as well
History.
Origins.
Martin grew up in an affluent home raised by her mother after the premature of her father. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Martin joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment, a division of the Red Cross, and helped with the nursing of wounded soldiers. After completing her period of service, she returned home to Ireland. There, she was inspired by the Reverend Thomas Roynane, a new curate assigned to her parish, to serve as a missionary in China as part of the proposed new religious congregation of the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban. In the meanwhile, she was called upon to help in nursing victims of the Spanish flu, which had begun to devastate populations around the world. To prepare for her missionary service, she went to England in January 1919 for further medical training. She was scheduled to undertake training in midwifery the following year. Her mother's severe illness prevented her from taking that training, however, as she had to return home to care for her.
By chance, Joseph Shanahan, C.S.Sp., a member of the missionary Holy Ghost Fathers, had just been named Vicar Apostolic for the new Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Nigeria, then still a British colony. He received permission to recruit among the secular clergy to serve there on contracts of five-years duration. Roynane received permission from his own bishop to volunteer for this work.
In April 1920, Roynane arranged for Martin to meet the new bishop, and she volunteered her services as a lay missionary to work in his jurisdiction. She advised him that she was about to commence training as a midwife. Agnes Ryan, another initial candidate for the Columban Sisters and by now in her fourth year of medical training, advised Martin that she wished to join her in the African mission. She completed that training in February 1921.
Africa.
In April of that same year, Martin left Ireland for Nigeria, with Ryan, who had left her studies. They set sail for Africa from Liverpool on 25 May on the S.S. Elmina, a ship of the African Steamship Company. They arrived in the port of Calabar on 14 June. They arrived prepared to provide medical care, only to learn that they were expected to run a school which had been staffed by French Religious Sisters until two years prior. To give the parents and children of the school a sense of continuity, the two women were addressed as "Sisters" by the priests and treated as if they were already members of an established religious congregation.
By October, Ryan had contracted malaria and developed a heart condition, which required her return to Ireland. Forced to fill in as Acting Headmistress, Martin determined to confer directly with the bishop in his headquarters at Onitsha, a journey of 100 miles (160 kilometers), for which she brought along three of the oldest girls at the school. Meeting with the bishop, Martin was advised that caution was needed in providing medical care to the people of her mission, so as not to provoke objections by other missionaries in the region. Further, before leaving Ireland, the bishop had organized a support group of Catholic mothers to provide assistance to the missions, of which Martin's own mother had become the president. They agreed that a religious congregation was needed to meet the needs of the mission. Upon her return to Calabar, Martin made a 30-day long retreat following the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, in an effort to clarify where she was being led.
In April 1922 the bishop traveled there and held two weeks of consultations with Martin, Roynane and another missioner, during which the Rule and Constitutions of a new congregation were hammered out, with the understanding that Martin would be the foundress. Martin was not to see the bishop again for two years. During this time she learned that the bishop was working to establish the new congregation in Ireland, a direction she felt would focus the congregation on teaching rather than the medical care to which she felt called. An Irish Sister of Charity, Sister Magdalen Walker, was released from her congregation to help in this new work. She arrived in Calabar in October 1923. The following January Martin was directed by the bishop to return to Ireland to make a novitiate period which would be recognized under new Church law. In March she joined Agnes Ryan, another volunteer at the mission, Elizabeth Ryan, and an American candidate, Veronica Hasson, as they started their time of postulancy, prior to admission to the novitiate year. After 18 months, however, upon completion of the novitiate year she left the community, as the training provided by the Dominican Sisters providing their formation had not been oriented toward medical care.
New paths.
In this formal step of forming the new congregation, Martin had encountered the prohibition in the new Code of Canon Law of 1917 of the Catholic Church against members of religious orders practicing medicine. Facing this barrier, Martin still felt a call to consecrated life and considered following the example of the recently canonized Carmelite nun, Thérèse of Lisieux (coincidentally also bearing the family name of Martin). In 1927 she applied to the monastery of that Order in Dublin, but her application was declined, solely on the decision of the prioress who overrode a unanimous vote by community, feeling that Martin was called to a different path in life. She then went through a new period of confusion until she was requested to consider again serving the missions. She then formed a small group of women to provide the domestic service for the preparatory school run by the Benedictine monks of Glenstal Abbey.
Following a long period of illness in 1932, the following year Martin approached the new Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, Archbishop Paschal Robinson, O.F.M. The nuncio was supportive of her goals and encouraged her continually over the next years. Finally, in February 1936, the Holy See lifted prohibition against Religious Sisters serving as doctors or midwives. Martin then sought a diocese which would accept a new congregation, without success. In October of that same year, Robinson's former secretary, Antonio Riberi, was named Apostolic Delegate in Africa, based in Kenya. He gave his support to having the congregation established in Calabar, which at that time was under a new Vicar Apostolic, James Moynagh, S.P.S., whose own sister was a member of the new community.
Foundation.
While still negotiating to purchase a house in Ireland to serve as a local base there—which complicated by the fact that they were not yet a formal congregation—the small community sailed for Nigeria at the end of 1936. Upon their arrival Martin suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized at Port Harcourt. It was there that she was allowed to profess religious vows on 4 April 1937. With that the Medical Missionaries of Mary became formally established as a congregation.
Current status.
Religious Sisters.
Today the Medical Missionaries of Mary number some 400 women from 20 countries, who serve in 14 different countries around the world. These are: Ireland, England, Angola, Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Brazil, Honduras and the United States. The Sisters and are trained in a variety of health-related professions. Their special concern is the care of the medical needs of mothers and children and the fostering of family life.
Associate members.
As well as sisters with lifelong religious vows, there are about 100 associate members, both men and women, who feel drawn to the spirituality of the congregation and to apply its values in their daily lives, making an annual covenant to live it out in their daily lives. MMM associates can be found in 12 different countries.

Zvi Yanai

Zvi Yanai (Hebrew: צבי ינאי ) (June 9, 1935 - December 16, 2013) was an Israeli civil servant, publicist and writer.
Biography.
Sandor Toth (later Zvi Yanai) was born in Pescara, Italy. His father was a baritone singer from Budapest and his mother was a prima ballerina from Gratz, Austria. They were not married. His father was Christian and his mother was Jewish. He was raised as a Protestant but converted to Catholicism in 1942 and studied for the priesthood.
Science, Technology and Space Minister Ya’akov Peri expressed his sorrow on Monday over the death of onetime ministry director-general, publicist and philosopher Zvi Yanai at the age of 78.
He edited the influential Hebrew-language journal Mahshavot (Thoughts) and was a consultant and lecturer in the field of science, culture and philosophy, even though he was largely self-taught.
Born in Italy, as Sandro Toth, to a Jewish ballerina from Austria and a Christian baritone singer from Hungary, Yanai was raised as a Protestant but converted to Catholicism and studied to be a priest at the age of eight.
He immigrated to Mandatory Palestine at the age of 10 and was sent to a kibbutz. He later served in the Israel Defense Force and worked at IBM-Israel for many years.
Yanai became a self-described atheist, but nevertheless felt a strong connection to Jewish history and thought.
“Besides Zvi being a rare philosopher and author with an unusual life story, he was director-general of the ministry between 1973 and 1997.
Some of its current programs continue to function due to his initiatives. His then-innovative ideas to bring the general public closer to science will continue to be the basis for many of our activities in the future,” Peri said.
Yanai was a “pioneer who opened up the world of science to the layman. His work can still be identified in popular culture today,” he concluded. 
Yanai immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1945 at the age of ten. He was sent to Kibbutz Ramat David. He served as a paratrooper in the Israel Defense Force.
He began to work for IBM in 1970.
Yanai was head of Israel's Ministry of Science and editor of the periodical "Mahshavot" (Thoughts).

Augustus Ulyard

Augustus or August Ulyard (1816–1900) was the first American-born professional baker in Los Angeles, California, after that city became part of the United States. In 1856–57 he was a member of the Common Council, which oversaw the governance of the young pueblo.
Personal.
Ulyard, whose parents were French, was born on February 22, 1816, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he learned to be a baker. He enlisted as a Texas Volunteer in the Mexican War, after which he went to St. Louis, Missouri, where he was married to Mary Field of England. The couple had no children of their own but, after they arrived in Los Angeles, "at different periods" they "adopted homeless children until there were seven in all."
The couple arrived in Los Angeles on December 31, 1852, after crossing the country with a wagon train of pioneers that left from Council Bluffs and pursued the Southern Emigrant Trail through the Cajon Pass and San Bernardino.
According to Ulyard's obituary in the "Los Angeles Times," "at that time there were but five American women in Los Angeles aside from Mrs. Ulyard. The town consisted of a small group of adobe buildings in the neighborhood of the Plaza."
Ulyard died August 5, 1900.
In Los Angeles.
Bakery.
Ulyard rented an adobe and set up a bakery business, using yeast that his wife brought across the Great Plains to their new home. Ulyard "soon sought a new location on the outskirts of the pueblo, at First and Main Streets," later occupied by the Natick House. Later he moved to the southwest corner of Fifth and Main, site of the Alexandria Hotel.
Ulyard was the first American-born baker in Los Angeles, naming his shop the American Bakery. He was in competition with Joseph LeLong, who was running his Jenny Lind Bakery and baking French bread. Ulyard made "German and American bread and cake, which soon found favor with many; later he added freshly-baked crackers," which he advertised as "baked in Los Angeles, and superior to those half spoiled by the sea voyage" from San Francisco.
The bakery was taken over by Louis Mesmer and then by James Rowan and his son, Thomas E. Rowan. The building was damaged by fire in December 1869, a circumstance that led to the establishment of Los Angeles's first organized fire company.
Stagecoach.
In the 1870s Ulyard began a stage business, with a conveyance drawn by four horses from Los Angeles at 7:30 each morning and returning from Santa Monica at 3:30 in the afternoon, "calling at all four Los Angeles hotels as well as the private residences of prospective patrongs." The fare was one dollar.
Public service.
In 1856 Ulyard helped organize the Republican League in California and worked on behalf of the John C. Fremont campaign for president in 1856. He was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council on May 5, 1856, and was reelected once, serving until June 22, 1857, when he resigned.
Anecdote.
In 1889, the Ulyards went to police court in Los Angeles and swore out a complaint against a book agent who, they said, "had seized her Ulyard by the arm and handled her in an exceedingly rough manner" when she, following her husband's precedent of several days previous, refused to purchase a copy of a "history of Southern California" in which appeared a biography of Mr. Ulyard. "The officers are looking for the fellow," the "Times" reported.

Aquathlon (underwater wrestling)

Aquathlon (also known as underwater wrestling) is an underwater sport where two competitors wearing masks and fins wrestle underwater in an attempt to remove a ribbon from each other's ankle band in order to win the bout. The "combat" takes place in a square ring within a swimming pool, and is made up of three 30-second rounds, with a fourth round played in the event of a tie. The sport originated during the 1980s in the former USSR (now Russia) and was first played at international level in 1993. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 2008.
Competition area.
The sport is conducted in a swimming pool with a water depth between and . The competition area consists of a square ring and a wide free area around the ring, both marked with ropes floating on the surface of the water. One side of the ring is marked with a red rope (known as the "red side") while the opposite side is marked with a yellow rope (known as the "yellow side"). At the bottom of the pool, a square mat with a white circle in the centre (in diameter) is placed immediately underneath the competition area. At opposite sides of the mat, a red hoop and a yellow hoop, each measuring square in diameter, are located. The red hoop is located underneath the red rope floating on the pool’s surface while the yellow hoop is below the yellow rope.
Equipment.
Competitors wear a swimsuit, a diving mask, fins made of rubber or polyurethane, a water polo cap and two ankle bands ( long by wide) to which 2 coloured ribbons ( square long by wide) are fixed. The Competitor on the red side wears a red or blue cap and yellow ribbons while the Competitor on the yellow side wears a white or yellow cap and red ribbons.
Play.
A competition which is known as a "combat" consists of three rounds each of 30 seconds duration, and an additional round held to establish the winner in the event of a tie. Intervals between rounds should not be less than 30 seconds and a minimum interval of at least one minute is required between any two combats.
Origins and history.
The sport was created and developed during the years 1980 to 1982 by Igor Ostrovsky, an underwater sports coach at the Moscow Technological Institute. It was first officially demonstrated in April 1982 in Moscow. The first International Competition was held during August 1993 in Moscow. During March 1996, representatives of diving federations from Russia, Ukraine and Israel met in Moscow to establish the International Aquathlon Association (IAA). IAA’s goals are to develop the sport, encourage the foundation of national federations and associations to play the sport throughout the world, ensure the adoption of international rules of competition and authorise official international competitions. The sport was presented to CMAS in 2007 at the CMAS Games in Bari, Italy. It received recognition from CMAS at the General Assembly held in May 2008 and international level competition under the auspices of CMAS commenced in late 2008. In 2009, the Aquathlon Commission was established within the CMAS Sport Committee with Igor Ostrovsky as its inaugural president.
Governing body.
The governing body is the Aquathlon Commission of the CMAS Sports Committee. As of March 2013, the following countries have affiliated with the Commission - Byelorussia, Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Russia and Spain.
Championships.
Prior to 1990, all competition was held in the Soviet Union. The 1st Russian Open Aquathlon Championship was held in Tula in 1992. In 1993, the 1st International Aquathlon Competition was held in Moscow with national teams from Israel, Russia and Ukraine in attendance. A series of Friendship Competitions were held between Israel and Jordan during 1997 in Aqaba, Jordan and during 1998 in Netanya, Israel. Between the years 2000 and 2006, international competitions were held in Moscow, Tula and Sochi in Russia, Istanbul in Turkey, and in Tiraspol in Moldova.
Since May 2008, the following major championships have been conducted under the auspices of CMAS:

Pasvik Nature Reserve

Pasvik Nature Reserve (; ) is a bilateral nature reserve located in the valley of Pasvikdalen in Norway and Russia. The nature reserve was established in 1992 (Russia) and 1993 (Norway), and covers an area of . The Norwegian part, in the municiaplity of Sør-Varanger, covers , while the Russian part, in Pechengsky District, Murmansk Oblast, covers . The nature reserve includes unexploited parts of Pasvikelva and has a rich birdlife.
Along with Øvre Pasvik National Park and Øvre Pasvik Landscape Protection Area in Norway and Vätsäri Wilderness Area in Finland, Pasvik Nature Reserve constitutes part of Pasvik–Inari Trilateral Park.
Geography.
Pasvik Nature Reserve consists of two legally separate but geographically adjoined protected areas, with a combined area of . Located in the valley of Pasvikdalen, it protects the river of Pasvikelva and its vicinity, straddling the Norway–Russia border, with of its area being made up by water surface. The Norwegian segment is entirely located within Sør-Varanger. It stretches , from Jordanfoss in the north to the damn at Hestefoss, and is up to wide covering an area of , of which is water. The segment in Russia, located within Peschengsky District, is long and runs from Svanevatn in the north to Hestfoss. The nature reserve covers the area of this stretch which is located within the Border Security Zone—i.e. from the national border to the border fence near the highway. The Russian reserve has an area of , of which is water surface.
The nature reserves center around the reservoir of Fjærvann, one of the few parts of Pasvikelva which remains intact largely as it did prior to the construction of the seven hydroelectric power stations along the river. The lake and its surrounding wetland areas are among the richest Nordic areas for waders, ducks, gees and swans. Fjærvann remains the most important such area along the river, in part because it is one of the first parts of the watershed to be ice-free. On the Russian side the reserve also includes a comparatively large area of pine forest area which is not directly related to Fjærvann, while the Norwegian side only include the reservoir and its immediate surroundings.
The geology of the area formed at the transition of the Mesoarchean and Neoarchean Eon, 2.8 billion years ago. It contains areas which are mineral-rich, which has resulted in an iron ore mine at Bjørnevatn and a nickel mine in Nikel. A belt of the Petsamo Formation cuts through the reserve; its limestone-rich rocks give rise to the bitch-rise flora, which contrasts the otherwise pine-dominated forests of the area. The landscape consists of hills, moraines and melt-water deposits, supplemented with kettles and glacial erratics. The landscape has been formed by two periods of ice sheets during the Quaternary glaciation, which has rounded all rock features in the area.
The areas in the reserve with good drainage are dominated with podzol soil. Areas with less drainage are dominated by mire, the most dominating part of the landscape, with high concentration of peat. In some places there is sand sediment deposits create heaths. Near the lakes there are occasional parties of scree.
Hydrology.
Pasvikelva runs through the reserve in the valley of Pasvikdalen. The river has its headwater in Lake Inari and its mouth at Bøkfjorden of the Barents Sea, experiencing a total fall of . Because of the valley's flat and wide shape, the river is shallow, ranging from , and from several hundred meters to several kilometers wide.
The river originally consisted of a series of lakes connected by short waterfalls. This was altered during the construction of seven hydroelectric power stations. This has given an even flow of water throughout the year and the original river course has only been preserved in select locations. Each of the damns has created its own reservoir, which have their lowest water levels in April, typically below the peak level. The reservoirs are iced up from October to May.
Climate.
The climate is dominated by cold winds from the Arctic Ocean and mild winds from the Atlantic. Northern winds are most common during summer, which can occasionally give snow in mid-summer. Mean July temperature is , with a peak registered temperature of . Mean January temperature is . There is midnight sun from 23 May to 20 July and polar night from 20 November to 23 January.
In general there is more low pressure areas in the winter and higher pressure during summer. Most of the annual mean of precipitation falls during summer, qualifying the area as a semi-arid climate. However, high groundwater, low evaporation and that most of the rain falls during the growth season results in relatively good growth conditions. The first snowfall arrives in September or October and remains until April. Snow depths normally reach .
Flora.
Russian scientists have classified the vegetation as forest tundra and taiga, while Norwegian scientists have classified it as northern boreal ecosystem, with northern parts forming a gradient into an Alpine tundra zone. The most common trees are Scots pine, while the European spruce is less common. Pine trees can reach a height of . There are occasional areas with broad-leaved trees, including aspen, rowan, alder and goat willow. The Russian section contains sections of old-growth forest. The northern-most parts of the reserve has a birch.
The vegetation sees a mix of mountainous species and Siberian species normally found only as far west as the Kola Peninsula. Mountainous species not commonly found in such wet and lowland areas include snow saxifrage and Alpine chickweed and Marsh Labrador tea. There are three types of mire. The most dominant is rice mire, covered in Marsh Labrador tea, cup lichen and heather. The other are grass mires which are dominated by cottongrass and "carex" and string mire which have predominantly "Sphagnum". Rubus chamaemorus are common throughout the mires.
Fauna.
Pasvik is at the intersection between Western and Eastern species, and between the forest tundra and Arctic tundra. Frogs are the only amphibians and the viviparous lizard are the only reptiles. There are 34 species of mammals in the national park. The only non-wild animals are reindeer. Mice are the most commons, especially the Eurasian pygmy shrew. The only true Arctic species is the Norway lemming. Larger species include the brown bear, a declining number of wolverines, and moose, in addition to other common, smaller mammals . The American mink is an introduced species which has become quite common.
The most commons species of fish in the river are "Coregonus lavaretus", European perch and Northern pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommons fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.
The area is known for its diversity of birds, with 212 species having been registered as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the Black-throated Loon, the Bean Goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the Common Goldeneye. Commons predator birds include the Rough-legged Buzzard and Merlin, while the White-tailed Eagle and Golden Eagle are less common. The Short-eared Owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being Common Ringed Plover, Ruff and Spotted Redshank. Other comon birds are the Common Gull, Arctic Tern and sparrows.
History.
The oldest archaeological finds in Pasvikdalen date to Stone Age and the Komsa culture. These nomadic people would arrive in the valley during summer and sustained themselves largely on fishing in the river. The oldest historic records of the area date to the 16th century, by which time the Skolts were inhabiting the area, which had organized the valley as a siida. The Pasvik area was traditionally located in a common Norwegian and Russian area without a defined national border. When the border was established in 1826, after which the population moved to the Russian side of the border. The valley later received a limited Norwegian population and from the 1850s immigration from Finland, both on the Norwegian and Russian side of the border. The area around the reserved remained unpopulated. The area became part of the Finnish Civil War, when Finland secured a corridor to the Arctic Ocean. This was subsequently reverted following the Winter War in 1939-1940.
The first major interest in the ornithology of the area arose following the inspections leading to the border in 1826. Also the flora was found to be rich, as it was in the intersection of the western and eastern vegetation zones, giving a unique mix of vegetation. The most important work was carried out by Hans Tho. L. Schaanning and Johan Koren, who settled in the valley in 1900. The area was also of interest for Swedish and Russian expeditions and scientists. Schaanning remained for twelve years.
Norway considered the area for conservation from 1978, with arguments being related to the wetland areas importance for aquatic birds and especially Fjærvann. Fjærvann was subsequently included in Norway's list of possible Ramsar sites. In the late 1980s a joint Norwegian–Russian environmental agreement was signed, and discussion of a joint nature reserve commenced at a meeting in Murmansk in 1989. Common inspections were carried out in 1990, after which the Russian authorities indicated that they would include comparatively large areas of pine forest on their side of the river in a protected area.
Management.
The rationale to protect the area is to conserve a wilderness area which is important habitat for ducks, gees, waders and Whooper Swans. The reserve is also in place to protect the original river bed. Coordination of the management on the Norwegian side is the responsibility of the County Governor of Finnmark. Day-to-day management is carried out by the Kirkenes office of the Norwegian Nature Inspectorate, a division of the Norwegian Environment Agency. The same agency is responsible for management of the national park and landscape protection area.
The Russian reserve is managed through separate entity organized to manage the reserve. Management differs considerably, in that the reserve is used as a basis for extensive research. Each year a Nature Chronicle is published about the park.
Along with Øvre Pasvik National Park and Øvre Pasvik Landscape Protection Area in Norway and Vätsäri Wilderness Area in Finland, Pasvik Nature Reserve constitutes part of Pasvik–Inari Trilateral Park.

Ōnishiki Ittetsu

Ōnishiki Ittetsu (born 11 September 1953 as Morio Obori) is a former sumo wrestler from Sado, Niigata, Japan. He made his professional debut in May 1968, and reached the top division in September 1973. His highest rank was "komusubi". He retired in January 1988 and is currently an elder in the Japan Sumo Association under the name Yamashina.
Career.
He joined sumo in May 1968 at the age of just 14, competing under his own surname of Obori. He was considered a very promising prospect and after winning his first juryo division championship in May 1973 he was given the shikona Onishiki, after a great rikishi from his Dewanoumi stable, the 26th Yokozuna Onishiki Uichiro. Just two tournaments later he became the first wrestler in sumo history to win all three sansho or special prizes, for Fighting Spirit, Technique and Outstanding Performance, in his debut top division tournament. He was also runner–up in this basho and earned his first kinboshi by defeating yokozuna Kotozakura. He was promoted straight to komusubi, which was to be his highest rank, but he suffered a serious back injury and scored only 3–12. He never made the rank again. As well his back problem he also suffered from knee problems and diabetes, and spent the rest of his career moving up and down the ranks of the two salaried divisions. He was to win seven more kinboshi, but he was also demoted to juryo on a number of occasions, where he picked up three more juryo championships. He only fell to the 3rd "makushita" division once during this period though. In this tournament in May 1979 at "makushita" 1 he posted a perfect 7-0 record, took the championship, and also handed Itai his first defeat in professional sumo, ending a consecutive winning streak from debut which was a record at that time. In May 1982 he became the first wrestler to immediately follow a win by default (over Koboyama) with a loss by default. He retired in January 1988 rather than face demotion to the makushita division.
Retirement.
Onishiki has remained in sumo as a toshiyori or elder, and is known as Yamashina Oyakata. He has worked as a coach at Dewanoumi stable and as a member of the Japan Sumo Association′s board of directors.
Fighting style.
Onishiki was a yotsu sumo specialist who favoured hidari yotsu, or a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent′s mawashi. His favourite kimarite or techniques were yori kiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

Whore of the Orient

Whore of the Orient is an upcoming action-adventure video game for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows being developed by Team Bondi, due for a tentative 2015 release.
Setting.
Set in Shanghai in 1936, the game is centered around a corrupt city in the hands of Western powers, filled with mob crime and political troubles. The Kuomintang ruthlessly puts down labor movements in an effort to suppress communism, whilst the International Police Force attempt to keep the peace.
Development.
Following the release of Team Bondi's 2011 video game "L.A. Noire", the company was in talks with other studios to work with, like they had previously done with Rockstar Games. It was reported that no companies actually wanted to work with Team Bondi, due to previous claims that their work ethic was unhealthy. However, it was later stated that Kennedy Miller Mitchell bought out Team Bondi, and that they're working together on "Whore of the Orient".
Various people involved in the development of the project suggest that the game will be a narrative action adventure title that is similar to Team Bondi's earlier title, "L.A. Noire". It is suggested that the proprietary facial MotionScan technology used in "L.A. Noire" will be reused in the new game project.
The project has received $200,000 worth of funding from Screen NSW, an Australian trade and investment board. Early unfinished gameplay footage was leaked in mid-2013, depicting the combat-style action.

<doc id="36894282" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36894282" title="Eye poke">
Eye poke

An eye poke, eye jab, eye stab, eye strike or poke in the eye is a strike at the eye or eyes of a human or animal. It is typically made with the fingers which may either be forked to jab both eyes or held together, like a bird's beak, to strike with force and protect the fingers from damage. The attack became better known among the public due to its use in comedy; the idea of using it to entertain was likely invented by the vaudeville duo of Joe Weber and Lew Fields.
Sports.
In sporting events, a losing fighter will sometimes break the rules, and poke someone in the eye leading to the fight be ended as "no decision," thus preventing them from taking a loss. Some events try to prevent eye poking by having fighters wear gloves with webbing over the fingers.
Self defense.
In a street fight situation, when one's opponent may be trying to inflict serious harm, martial arts expert Kelly McCann advises that the eyes should be a "persistent primary target". An eye poke needs little power to be effective, and it can stop even highly determined attackers. If the hand is kept at an approximately 45° angle to the opponent's face during the strike, there is less risk of hurting ones fingers, and even if they do not connect with the eye, the palm can impact on the opponent's face. 
Comedy.
The eye poke was a signature move in the slapstick antics of the comedy and vaudeville act The Three Stooges, who mastered the technique. The form of attack was well known among children who watched the show.

Fugue in G minor, BWV 131a

The Fugue in G minor, BWV 131a, is a piece of organ music attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach.
It is a transcription of the last movement of the cantata , which features a permutation fugue. The cantata dates from 1707 or 1708, which almost certainly provides a "" for the organ arrangement.
G minor is used extensively in the cantata, which sets one of the penitential psalms. In the cantata the fugue is sung by the choir. The score of the cantata does not feature an organ part as such, but the basso continuo (for which a figured bass is provided) may well have been played on the organ. The cantata is definitely by Bach, while the arrangement for organ is regarded by some authorities as spurious.

Britannia Unchained

Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity is a political book written by several British Conservative Party MPs. It was released on 13 September 2012. Its authors present a treatise, arguing that Britain should adopt a different and radical approach to business and economics or risk "an inevitable slide into mediocrity".
The book is written by Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss – five Tory MPs who were elected in May 2010 and belong to the party's Thatcherite-leaning Free Enterprise Group. The text sets out their vision for the United Kingdom's future as a leading player in the global economy, arguing that Britain needs to adopt a far-reaching form of free market economics, with fewer employment laws, and suggesting the UK should learn lessons from the business and economic practices of other countries, including Canada, Australia and the tiger economies of the Far East like China and Singapore.
Summary.
An article written by four of the authors for the ConservativeHome website, and published on the day of the book's publication said, "We are convinced that Britain’s best days are not behind us. We cannot afford to listen to the siren voices of the statists who are happy for Britain to become a second rate power in Europe, and a third rate power in the world. Decline is not inevitable."
The content suggests that Britain has lessons to learn from a number of other countries regarding policy, which it claims are outperforming the United Kingdom, and sets out the areas where the UK needs to rethink its strategy, citing examples of countries which the authors believe have been successful in these areas. On deficit reduction the example of Canada during the 1990s is given, where overall spending was reduced by 20% between 1992 and 1997. On education the authors lament the relatively low number of students who study mathematics at A Level, which they say is 15%, contrasting it with Japan where 85% study the subject at a similar level. In terms of business and economics, Israel is cited as an example of a country that supports innovation, while the United States is given as an example of a nation that supports risk-taking. The work ethic of Britain's employees is compared to those of other countries, with suggestions that a decreasing number of Britain's workers are contributing towards economic growth, and to maintain state spending, which it is said undermines the UK's competitiveness.
Reception.
The book caused controversy in August 2012 after a short extract appeared in London's "Evening Standard" which accused British workers of laziness, and lagging behind their Asian counterparts. Part of this was later reprinted in "The Guardian": "The British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music." The comments were criticised by union leaders, among them the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Brendan Barber: "The problem with the UK economy is not its workers, but a severe lack of jobs." The Labour Party urged British Prime Minister and Conservative leader David Cameron to distance himself from the views, and the Shadow Secretary of State for Business Chuka Umunna commented: "First they blame British businesses for their economic failures and now they blame the people who work within them, showing how out of touch the Tory party has become." Speaking later to "The Guardian" one of the authors, Dominic Raab, claimed the passage had offered "a skewed and inaccurate reflection of what is in the book".
Writing for the "New Statesman", Jonathan Portes criticised the accuracy of the content, saying the book contained "factual errors" and evidence of "slipshod research" by the authors. "The authors of Britannia Unchained – five Conservative MPs including Elizabeth Truss and Dominic Raab – argue that Britons are 'idlers . . . obsessed with the idea of the gentleman amateur'. Sadly, so far the reaction to the book has proved their point. They’ve had headlines in the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and the Guardian has marked them out as the young Tories to watch. Job done. Yet they’ve done it without doing any serious research, let alone thinking about what that research might mean. They have joined the political version of celebrity culture – the same culture that they argue, to some extent compellingly, makes Britons believe they can get on without doing any hard work."

Aldo Perroncito (18 May 1882, Turin – 1929) was an Italian pathologist. He was the son of parasitologist Edoardo Perroncito (1847–1936). He is known for research involving regeneration of peripheral nerves, kinetic behavior of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis, and studies of pellagra. 
In 1905 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Pavia, where he spent the following five years as an assistant to pathologist Camillo Golgi (1846–1926). During this time period he also conducted studies at the Institute of Physiology in Berlin and at the Institute of Parasitology in Paris. Afterwards he taught classes in general pathology at the University of Cagliari, returning to Pavia in 1922 as a full professor and as a successor to Camillo Golgi.
While an assistant at Pavia, he demonstrated with a severed peripheral nerve, that the stump attached to the cell body was able to survive and regenerate new branches, while its other stump, being detached from the cell body, degenerated. In 1910 he discovered that a Golgi body dissociated into a number of elongated structures during cell division. Perroncito named the split up pieces "dictyosomes".

Palace Theater (Crossville, Tennessee)

The Palace Theater at 210 N. Main St. in Crossville, Tennessee is a historic movie theater built in the 1930s.
The building design embodies the Art Deco and Moderne styles. The exterior is faced with Crab Orchard stone laid in patterns characteristic of Art Deco. The neon-illuminated marquee and bulls-eye wall sconces in the interior are other characteristic elements of these styles. The auditorium seated about 600 people. 
The Palace Theater opened in November 1938 with a screening of "If I Were King", featuring Ronald Colman. It operated as a first-run theater until the 1970s, but closed in 1978 when a new two-screen theater opened in Crossville. The building was vacant for many years, while its physical condition deteriorated. 
The Palace was among the movie theaters featured in the 1987 book "Great American Movie Theaters" by architectural historian David Naylor. A subsequent citizen campaign for its preservation led to the city of Crossville purchasing the building in 1993. The theater building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 and was later restored with public financial support. It now serves as a multipurpose community auditorium.

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 241

Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 241 (P. Oxy. 241 or P. Oxy. II 241) is an authorization to the agoranomos asking him to register a loan. It is written in Greek and discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. It is dated to the late first century. Currently it is housed in the Princeton University Library.
Description.
This document is one of three, along with P. Oxy. 242 and P. Oxy. 243, which follow a legal formula that has not been found outside of the Oxyrhynchan administrative area. These three documents involve mortgages of slaves, land, or houses. The salient difference is that these three documents are addressed to the agoranomeion (the office of the agoranomoi) rather than an office generally (γραΦείον). This indicates that in Oxyrhynchus, the agoranomeion functioned as a repository for records.
Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 241 is an authorization from Caecilius Clemens to the agoranomos to register a loan of money from Thonis to his brother on the security of a share in a house. The measurements of the fragment are 193 by 66 mm.
It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899.
Text.

Newsmakers

Newsmakers (original title: Goryachie novosti) is a 2009 Russian action thriller film directed by Swedish director Anders Banke. It's a remake of the Hong Kong film "Breaking News" by Johnnie To.
Plot.
Moscow police officer Smirnov sets out to capture the violent gangleader Herman after a failed robbery. Meanwhile Smirnov superiors are trying to find a way to better the reputation of the Moscow police. The young eager pr-girl Katya suggests that they should turn the capture of Herman into a reality show, showing off the police as action heroes. The situation gets complicated when Herman and his gang tries the same tactic. The situation soon escalates into a fullblown war, both in media and on the streets.
Production.
Anders Banke's horror/black comedy film "Frostbite" about a gang of teen vampires spreading fear in an arctic town in the far north of Sweden became the highest grossing independent film in Russia 2006, received very positive reviews and reached cult status. The Russian distributors of "Frostbite" where moving into producing their own films and asked Banke if he wanted to helm a Russian language remake of Jonnie To's film "Breaking News" and he agrees. Anders Banke who had learned Russian when he got a chance to study film on VGIK had no problem directing the Russian cast. Fittingly, Banke's frequent collaborator Chris Maris had also studied at VGIK. The film was shot in Trollhättan in Sweden and in Moscow. The film was shot on 35 mm like "Frostbite" as Anders Banke dislikes filming digitally.
Music.
The score was composed by Anthony Lledo and performed by the Danish National Chamber Orchestra. "Leaders of Men" by Joy Division is featured prominently in the film.
Response and boxoffice.
Despite an aggressive promotional campaign—producer Klebanov and the film’s cast personally presented the film in nearly 20 Russian cities—the film enjoyed scant popularity among Russian audiences and film critics. The producers attributed film’s lack of commercial success to its May release, suggesting that May’s warm temperatures discourage people from going to the movies. Russians’ current lack of interest in national cinema, the alleged absence of a star system in Russia, and—somewhat ironically—the film’s insufficient promotion in the Russian media were also cited as culprits in the film’s unfavorable commercial and critical reception.
Splash Magazine included the film on its Top Ten list from Tribeca Film Festival 2009 citing it as a must see.
Tiny Beam of Light also provided a positive review of the film praising the score and the entertainment value.

The first copy appeared on 1 January 1874, printed in what was then called the "Fuldaer Actiendruckerei". Around 1000 subscriptions to the Catholic-oriented paper, which appeared three times a week (five years later it was published daily).
In 1929 the paper warned its readers of the dangers of Nazi ideology: "The national socialism of the Hitler party, the overestimation of nationalism, the belief in violence and power can never agree with Catholic doctrine. The antisemitic tendencies and the injunctions toward violence hurt more than just Catholic convictions about state and society, but also the ten commandments, which apply to all humanity."

<doc id="36894632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36894632" title="Nosferatu D2">
Nosferatu D2

Nosferatu D2 were an Indie Rock band from Surrey, England. Although their years were short, the band would experience something of a posthumous renaissance on the strength of their shelved debut album being released by the fledgling Audio Antihero label. The album and the story of its release would be the subject of a number of BBC stories, while the album itself has received continued acclaim and airplay long after its release.
2005-2007.
Nosferatu D2 formed in the ashes of the similarly short-lived band called Tempertwig who released one single (a 7" split with Air Formation) before splitting up and freeing brothers Ben (Guitar/Vocals) and Adam Parker (drums) to begin again as Nosferatu D2. Tempertwig would however find a fan in the BBC's Steve Lamacq before their split, with Lamacq airing their "Bratpack Film Philosophy" single on his evening show. After Tempertwig, Nosferatu D2 began to play shows and demo new material, some of which was aired on XFM by John Kennedy and BBC Radio 1 by Huw Stephens. One of these demos received a praising review from the NME courtesy of James McMahon and another earned a recommendation from Art Brut member Chris Chinchilla.
Their most notable shows were with Air Formation and an opening slot for Los Campesinos! and Sky Larkin at The Spitz. Los Campesinos! would soon achieve success on the Wichita Records label and would give Nosferatu D2 a "thanks to" credit on their debut "Hold on Now, Youngster..." LP.
Ben Parker would then begin writing and recording under the Superman Revenge Squad name (taken from the comic book organisations of the same name) and Nosferatu D2 would quietly disband.
Despite the sparsity of their catalogue at this time and only having played a handful of shows, their song "Springsteen" caught the attention of Jamie Halliday the future founder of Audio Antihero records. His enthusiasm for the band would finally materialise in the release of their debut album in October 2009, more than two years since they disbanded.
Debut album/Posthumous acclaim.
In October 2009 the fledgling Audio Antihero label announced Nosferatu D2's ""We're Gonna Walk Around This City With Our Headphones On To Block Out The Noise"" LP as their debut release. This announcement was met by praise from Los Campesinos! member Gareth Campesinos! who said it "fucks up his provisional albums of the year list." The album was distributed by PMD.
The album itself was critically acclaimed. Drowned In Sound gave it 9/10 and called it "some kind of alchemy, not to be repeated", Pitchfork said it was "perfect in its hopelessness", The 405 awarded them 9/10 and speculated that it might be "one of those forgotten albums that will be hailed as influential come five or ten years", This Is Fake DIY graded it 8/10, The Music Fix labeled it a "lo-fi masterpiece" with a 9/10, Music Emissions awarded the LP a perfect 10/10, The Organ simply stated "I do like this, like it lots actually", Scotland's The Skinny marked it as 4/5, and The Line Of Best Fit stated that "your record collection is incomplete without its inclusion."
The album was also well received internationally by radio with songs from the album given multiple airings on BBC 6 Music, Dandelion Radio, NME Radio, ResonanceFM, Florida's WVUM FM, Melbourne's Triple R FM, Kooba Radio, BSM Rocks! Radio, the inaugural God Is In The TV podcast. Jon Solomon's show on New Jersey's WPRB FM, Vancouver's CITR-FM and The Wrong Rock Show on South Africa's Bush Radio.
The album and its story has endured and several radio features have been dedicated to it. In January 2011 Tom Robinson interviewed Ben Parker and Jamie Halliday about the album on a special "I Need An Antihero" edition of BBC Introducing, in September 2010 Spark Radio named the disbanded Nosferatu D2 as their "Artist Of The Month" and interviewed Audio Antihero about the release, in August 2011 Miami's WVUMFM featured an hour long Audio Antihero special in which Nosferatu D2 were a main topic, and in August 2012 BBC World Service/PRI's "The World" aired a feature story on the Nosferatu D2 album which included music from the band and interviews with the artist and label.
In September 2012 the band would re-issue remastered recordings of their final show as "Nosferatu D2 - Live At The Spitz" on the Audio Antihero label. It was made available as a free download via Bandcamp and like their debut album found acclaim from the online press.
Though the band have not recorded since their split and have stated that they will not reform they have contributed unreleased recordings to charity compilations to raise money for FSID, Shelterbox, Save The Children, Red Cross, Japan Society and New York (following Hurricane Sandy).
The band were remembered again in a "Buried Treasures" article for the Faded Glamour culture site and in a "Lost Bands" story dedicated to the band in a paperback book published by Rhubarb Bomb. Label-mate Benjamin Shaw would also cover their Anti-Christmas song "It's Christmas Time (For God's Sake)," the song was used once more for Darren Hayman (Hefner/The French) and FIKA Recordings' 2011 Digital Advent Calendar where they were featured alongside fellow AAH artists including Jack Hayter, Fighting Kites, Paul Hawkins, Ian Button, Broken Shoulder and Benjamin Shaw.

<doc id="36894725" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36894725" title="Derreen Garden">
Derreen Garden

Derreen Garden lies on a promontory in Kilmakilloge Harbour on the Beara Peninsula, in Tuosist parish, near Kenmare in County Kerry (Republic of Ireland). Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne (1816–1866) initiated the planting of the garden in 1863, but it was his son, Henry Charles Keith Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne (1845–1927), who from 1870 onwards gave the garden its present shape. Today it covers more than 60 acres and includes nearly 12 km of paths.
History.
The land around Derreen garden was the seat of the Mac Finin Dubh O'Sullivan family, a branch of the O'Sullivan Beare, since around 1320. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–1653) the property got confiscated and was granted in 1657 to Sir William Petty, physician of Oliver Cromwell, as reward for his services. The Mac Finin Dubh O'Sullivans became a large tenant of Petty. The estate came into the ownership of the Fitzmaurice family, when in 1692 Petty's daughter Anne married Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry, whose grandson William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, became Prime Minister of Great Britain and in 1784 was created Marquess of Lansdowne.
After the last male member of the Mac Finin Dubh O'Sullivans had died in 1809, the tenancy of the estate passed to Peter McSwiney, who was married to a niece of that family. In 1856 McSwiney was evicted from Derreen by William Steuart Trench (1808–1872), the land agent of Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (1780–1863), for being some years in arreas of rent. From 1857 onwards the house and its grounds were leased to different gentlemen. The last tenant was James Anthony Froude (1818–1894), an English historian, novelist, biographer, and editor of "Fraser's Magazine", who leased Derreen between 1868 and 1871. In 1864, shortly after succeeding his father, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne (1816–1866) spent some days at Derreen with his wife. Being taken by the beauty of the property, he decided to live there for part of the year. However, this never came to fruition, as in 1866 he suddenly died of a stroke at his London club.
When the 5th Marquess of Lansdowne inherited the property in 1866, he was, like his father, drawn to the remoteness of the place. In 1870 he personally supervised alterations to Derren House, and from 1871 onwards the new Marquess and his young wife, Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton (1850–1932), began to use Derreen as their summer residence.
In the same year Lansdowne embarked on an ambitious plan to transform the bare rock and scrub oak around the house into a luxuriant woodland garden. It is said that he employed 40 people to create the garden. 400 acres of land were planted to shelter a collection of scrubs and specimen trees. Many of them brought back from the Marquesses sojourns as Governor General of Canada and Viceroy of India. In addition he subscribed to the Himalayan plant-hunting expeditions and bought exotic plants from the well known nursery firm of Veitch. In 1903 King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited Derreen House and Garden and planted two commemorative bamboos.
With the exception of the years between 1883 and 1894, when he was successively Governor General of Canada and Viceroy of India, and those of the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) and the Irish Civil War (1922–1923), the 5th Marquess of Lansdowne continued to visit Derreen for three months of each year until his death in 1927, which occurred while he was travelling to Derreen.
During the Second World War, Derreen was separated from the Lansdowne title by the death of Charles Petty-Fitzmaurice, 7th Marquess of Lansdowne, who was killed in action in 1944, when his entailed estates were inherited by a kinsman. Derreen, not being entailed, was inherited by his sister, Katherine Evelyn Constance Petty-Fitzmaurice (1912–1995), and is now owned and managed by her son, the Hon. David Bigham.
The garden.
The well known garden extends over the greater part of the peninsula on which it lies. It covers an area of 60 acres and includes nearly 12 km of paths, which wind through mature and varied woodland. In the moist and mild climate, tender and exotic plants flourish. Many of the paths in the garden provide marvellous glimpses of the sea (Bay of Kilmakilloge) and the distant mountains (Caha Mountains, Macgillycuddy's Reeks).
Derreen garden is particularly noted for its rhododendrons (Rhododendron arboreum) and tree ferns (Dicksonia antarctica). Throughout the garden a rich patina of moss, lichens ferns and saxifrages gives a sub-tropical feel to the whole area. As a foil to the luxuriant plantings, there are great natural outcrops of rocks. The garden is open to the public every day all year round. 
The house.
Derreen garden is designed around Derreen house, which was originally built by the Mac Finin Dubh O'Sullivan family, a branch of the O'Sullivan Beare, in the first half of the eighteenth century. After the last male member of the Mac Finin Dubh O'Sullivans had died in 1809 the house passed to Peter McSwiney who was married to a niece of that family. He was evicted from Derreen house in 1856 by William Stewart Trench, the agent of Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne (1816–1866), for being some years in arreas of rent.
The house was enlarged between 1863 and 1866, when the 4th Marquess of Lansdowne built a new wing. Between 1870 and 1873 it was further enlarged by Henry Charles Keith Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne (1845–1927) at a cost of £2,500. James Franklin Fuller was appointed as architect.
The house was plundered and burned in 1922 during the Irish Civil War (1922–1923), but rebuilt in a similar style by the 5th Marquess of Lansdowne in 1924. Some financial help came from the Irish Free State. Derreen house underwent further reconstruction between 1925 and 1926, having been attacked by dry rot. It is not open to the public.

Political prisoners in Saudi Arabia

Dissidents have been detained as political prisoners in Saudi Arabia during the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Protests and sit-ins calling for political prisoners to be released took place during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests in many cities throughout Saudi Arabia, with security forces firing live bullets in the air on 19 August 2012 at a protest at al-Ha'ir Prison. , recent estimates of the number of political prisoners in Mabahith prisons range from a denial of any political prisoners at all by the Ministry of Interior, to 30,000 by the UK-based Islamic Human Rights Commission and the BBC.
Reports of arbitrary detention.
The UK-based Islamic Human Rights Commission claims that political prisoners in Saudi Arabia are usually arbitrarily detained without charge or trial. The Commission describes Saudi Arabian political imprisonment as "an epidemic" that includes "reformists, human rights activists, lawyers, political parties, religious scholars, bloggers, individual protestors, as well as long-standing government supporters who merely voiced mild and partial criticism of government policy."
1990s.
Following the 1990–91 Gulf War, a range of Saudi Arabian intelligentsia ranging from academics to religious scholars, signed public declarations calling for political reform, and in 1993 created the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR), whose spokesperson was Mohammad al-Massari. A "comprehensive campaign of mass arrests" was used in response. Detainees included al-Massari and other CDLR members, lawyer Suliman al-Reshoudi and surgeon Sa'ad Al-Faqih. The 1990s political prisoners were released under various conditions including travel and employment restrictions and house arrest.
2000s.
Bombings in Saudi Arabia during 2003–2006 by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) were used by Saudi authorities as justification for detaining critics of United States (US) and Saudi foreign policy as well as reformists. A mass arrest of academics, human rights activists and reformists, including Suliman al-Reshoudi, took place on 2 February 2007. It was described by Saudi authorities as "a successful counter-terrorism operation".
Prisoner-release protests.
In November 2008, twenty human rights activists started a two-day hunger strike to call for al-Reshoudi and the other 2 February 2007 detainees to be released. Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani of ACPRA stated that petitions calling for the activists to receive fair trials and better conditions of detention had been ignored, and that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly were not respected in Saudi Arabia. "Adalaksa.org" described the hunger strike as "the first co-ordinated multiple-location hunger strike in Saudi Arabia".
2010s.
Detentions.
According to the Islamic Human Rights Commission, "many independent political, activist and advocacy groups had been established" by 2010. Some of those detained included tribal leader Mukhlif al-Shammari who was charged with "annoying others" in his opinion articles published in a local newspaper and online; as well as assistant professor of law Muhammad al-Abdul Karim for publishing an article "The crisis of conflict amongst the governing wings in Saudi Arabia" online on 22 November 2010, and the 18-year-old university student Thamir Abdul Karim al-Khidr for his involvement in a human rights group and to pressure his father.
The Umma Islamic Party was created on 10 February 2011, declaring that the release of 188 political prisoners would constitute an important step towards political reform. Most of the party's cofounders were detained on 17 February 2011 and all but one conditionally released later in 2001 after signing declarations that they would not carry out "anti-government activity". The release conditions included travel bans and teaching bans.
Detentions of dissidents during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests included well-known activists such as Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, who was arrested on 21 March 2011 for his campaigning for the release of political prisoners, and "previously unknown individuals who have become overnight icons of the protest movement in Saudi Arabia", such as Khaled al-Johani, arrested on 11 March 2011 "Day of Rage". In March 2012, Amnesty International estimated the total amount of arrests related to the protests since March 2011 to be "hundreds". It stated that "most have been released without charge", some remained arbitrarily detained, and some were "charged with vague security-related and other offences".
Grievance Board.
A legal defence team for Suliman al-Reshoudi filed a court case in the Grievances Board against the Ministry of Interior/Mabahith on 16 August 2009 on the grounds that 2 February 2007 detentions were arbitrary. Eight court sessions were held, and the case was dismissed in the eighth session "for lack of jurisdiction". The eighth (final) session was attended by representatives of ACPRA, the Human Rights First Society, the National Society for Human Rights, and international journalists. Official Mahabith representatives were absent from the session, but Mabahith plainclothes agents were present in the corridors near the courtroom and in the courtroom itself and tried to prevent human rights organisation representatives and journalists from entering the courtroom. ACPRA concluded that the trial had shown "tremendous benefits", in that the Ministry of Interior had been brought the detainees to court in the presence of human rights activists and journalists, had allowed the detainees contact with lawyers, and had established the right to appear before the Grievances Board despite the Ministry's opposition.
Prisoner-release protests.
Protests and sit-ins calling for political prisoners to be released occurred repeatedly during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests. These took place at the Ministry of Interior in Riyadh on 20 March 2011 and in April and May 2011 in Qatif, al-Awamiyah and Hofuf in the Eastern Province. 20 March Riyadh protest included Suliman al-Reshoudi's daughter, 30 other women and 200 men. Similar protests took place in Riyadh and Buraidah in December 2011, and in July and August 2012 in front of the Ministry in Riyadh, in Mecca, in Ta'if, in Buraidah, near al-Ha'ir Prison and in Dammam.
In August 2012, Eastern Province protestors stated that their aim was for "all Shia and Sunni" detainees to be freed. In 19 August 2012 al-Ha'ir Prison protest, security forces fire live bullets in the air.
Number of political prisoners.
Claims and estimates of the number of political prisoners held in Saudi Arabia in 2011–2012 range from no political prisoners to 30,000.
Governmental sources.
In May 2011, Ministry of Interior spokesperson Mansour al-Turki stated that there are no political prisoners in Saudi Arabia, saying, "Allegations of political prisoners are not true. Every prisoner has the full right for a fair trial and can hire a lawyer to defend him ... Some prisoners don't want to reveal the full truth to their family members, and some family members can't believe the truth? ... Saudi Arabia doesn't use the police and intelligence in stifling dissent." On 1 September 2012, "Gulf News" reported a Ministry Interior statement that there are no political prisoners in Saudi Arabia.
A 2011 estimate by Mansour al-Turki cited by the Islamic Human Rights Commission is 5000 political prisoners. A March 2011 governmental estimated cited by the BBC was 10,000 political prisoners.
Opposition groups.
At its 10 February 2011 founding, the Umma Islamic Party called for the release of "188 prominent political prisoners", whom it listed. In March 2011, the BBC quoted an estimate of 30,000 political prisoners by "opposition activists".
Human rights organisations.
In September 2011, the Islamic Human Rights Commission stated that the "known political prisons in Saudi Arabia have a capacity to hold 10,000" and that the over-occupation rate was about a factor of three, thus inferring about 30,000 political prisoners altogether.

Helen Bickham

Helen Bickham is a Mexican artist, from Eurasian and American parents who began painting professionally later in life. She was born in Harbin, moving to the United States during World War II. She lived in Europe for a while but settled in Mexico in 1962 after visiting the country. She began drawing by the age of six, drawing and painting non-professionally until 1975 when she considers her career to have begun. She has had seventy individual exhibitions, participated in over 300 collective ones and been a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana since 1997. Her work is figurative, generally one or more figures on one or more landscapes, and described as introspective, with the aim of conveying a feeling or mood rather than a person or object.
Life.
Helen Bickham was born on June 9, 1935 in Harbin, Manchuria at the time of Japanese occupation. Her mother, Nadezna Ivanofnof Rachoak, was from a mixed Ukrainian/Asian family and her maternal grandfather worked for the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Her father, Howard Montgomery, was an American officer with the U.S. Navy, who died in World War II when Bickham was only eight. Before his death, her mother and she left China for the United States, arriving just before the attack on Pearl Harbor
Bickham grew up in various parts of the United States as an only child. She and her mother had a difficult time adjusting to life in the United States. Her mother did not speak English and worked menial jobs such as sewing and housecleaning socializine with other Euro-Asian refugees which spoke Russian. She was home alone a lot as a child because her mother had to work, spending most of her time reading and drawing.
Caught between cultures as a child, she often found herself as a lonely observer, drawing what she saw as early as age six. She remembers that as a child, the other children would often ask her to draw things for them such as a “mommy” or a “doctor.” If they did not specify, she would draw figures without clothes, like paper dolls, to add them later, but this caused one of the mothers to call her a “degenerate.” Her mother did not encourage her art; however, she did receive some support for her art at school. While she was in elementary school in Virginia, she was often excused from class to draw murals in the hall, usually with themes such as Thanksgiving, done on butcher paper. 
She was also an inquisitive child and young adult often not satisfied with the answers provided by her family and religion. Although neither her mother nor her stepfather thought that university was appropriate for girls, she managed to go to the University of California, Berkeley on scholarship. There, she took classes simply because someone stated that they were the hardest, with classes in every discipline, as the university system allowed students to design their own majors. She decided on American civilization as she was an immigrant and wanted to understand the ideas of Europe brought over to the continent by the original settlers. She did not major in art, but she took an art appreciation class. This class had an assignment of creating watercolor, and Bickham's desire to get the image just right caused the professor to comment that she was an artist. She was also required to visit a museum in San Francisco, a task she started grudgingly. However after she saw her first real Édouard Manet painting, instead of a reproduction, she stood transfixed and returned home happy to show her ticket stub to her professor. She married in the late fifties and had her first son, Geoffrey just before the family left for Europe.
When she lived in Florence, Italy, she had a landlady was a painter. She also had a chance to see many famous art pieces in their original spending much of her time in Europe in the museums of Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. She returned to the United States, where her second son, Brett, was born. She lived outside of Indianapolis, painting landscapes and still lifes.(revelation) At this time she met painter Bill Majors. He saw Bickham’s watercolors saying she painted them as if they were oils and bought her a set of oil paints. In 1962, she went to Mexico for a six week vacation. While she was gone, one of her friends in Indiana took three paintings from her home to enter in an art competition for her. These three were chosen to compete as part of a group of 600 from 6,000 and all three won prizes.
In Mexico, she says she fell in love with the country instantly and decided to stay permanently, wanting to provide a bicultural experience for her sons. Except for stays in the United States and Europe she has called Mexico home since. When she decided to live in Mexico, she was a single parent with one child who was ill and needed full-time care. She was not a privileged foreigner, but rather worked giving in English classes. She initially lived in a small town called San Lorenzo Acopilco located just west of Mexico City proper. It was difficult as the area was poor but she needed the peace and quiet it provided. She then moved to Mexico City because of the medical care that one of her sons needed. She became an English teacher in schools such as Garside and the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Zacatenco. During these years, she never stopped painting but her focuses shifted from landscapes to people as she was impressed with the people she met in the country.
For much of her life, she never considered becoming a professional painter. It was a hobby and a passion, a way of expressing her inner feelings. From 1962 to 1975 she was busy teaching English and raising her children. However, because she was on a tight budget, she went to exhibition openings in her free time, meeting many artists, who after seeing her so many times, began to invite her to their homes. She quit teaching English at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional when she asked for leave to take her children to Europe for a year and they denied it. In England she represented Mexico, presenting a latter from noted curator Fernando Gamboa to the cultural attache at the Mexican embassy there. She was then officially invited to exhibit in the country as a Mexican artist. She continued to exhibit with success and since returning to Mexico, she has been a full-time painter.
Today, Bickham lives in the Colonia Roma neighborhood in Mexico City. Her apartment has large windows which face the Plaza de las Cibeles with its fountain and provides natural light. Her paintings cover most of the walls, with the exception of the bedroom because she found herself at night taking them down to retouch them. She paints every morning after she wakes up either next to a window in her apartment or up on the building’s roof, often with coffee in hand. Physically, she has a fragile appearance but her eyes have been described as “laughing” and she often gets around Mexico City by bicycle. She says she has two great loves, people and nature. People and places that strike her can remain in her memory for years. She has traveled much of the world and believes that there are universal emotions that make us human. And also believes that a multiethnic, multicultural world where people live in peace is possible. She remains very attached to Mexico, saying that its people have a “real humanity” about them, capable of smiling and being polite even in trying economic circumstances. This has been an influence in her art, even an entire exhibition at UNAM called México a través del pincel de Helen Bickham” (Mexico through the brush of Helen Bickham) to demonstrate her impressions of Mexico.
Career.
Her first exhibition of her work was in 1963, but she considered her career to have begun in 1975 when she began painting full-time. Since then she has had seventy individual exhibitions and participated in over 300 collective ones, in Mexican cities such as Mexico City, Monterrey, Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta as well as in the United States, England, Scotland, Switzerland, Argentina, and Canada.
Some of her more notable exhibitions have included those at the Arts Association of the State of Indiana (1963), Galería May Brooks in Mexico City (1965), Foreign Friends in Acapulco (1970), Thomoas V. Robinson Galleries in Houston TX (1978) Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles (1980), Hotel Ritz-Carlton, Boston (1982), Howard Coron Collection in New York (1985), Zum Blauen Gallery in Winterthur, Switzerland (1989) and the Galería de Arte Misrachi in Mexico City (1995), Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Casa de la Primera Impresora in Mexico City (1996), Museo de la Ciudad de Querétaro in Querétaro (2003), Museo Ex Convento del Carmen in Guadalajara (2006), Galería Hecaro in Mexico City (2007) and the Forum in Xalapa (2010).
Some of her more notable works include "En el Jardín del Desierto", "En su Mente", "Hacia el Abismo", "Llegando al Fin del Día", "Cuatro Puntos" and a series called "Cacería en el Norte".
In the 1960s, she was included in a University of Texas book about contemporary Mexican art. She was accepted as a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana in 1997 and currently serves on its board.
Artistry.
Bickham has worked in a number of media including watercolor, oil, pencil, ink, lithography, engraving and paper embossing. She prefers medium to large size formats on canvas, fiberboard and museum board. She has also experimented with mixed media such as drawings over a wash and combining painting and drawing with embossing, such as with "Palomas", where the doves are embossed on to the paper, flying away from the hands of a crouched woman who is drawn most exactly. She begins and erases and moves images around the canvas until she is satisfied. She considered all of her pieces to be works in progress as long as they are in her possession and for this reason does not date her work.
Her work has always focused more on common people, based on those she sees in daily life as they tend to be less reserved about their emotions. Her work is figurative, but her figures are not to photographic detail, preferring to capture a feeling rather than a subject. Her earlier work in Mexico often depicted characteristic images from Mexico, usually poor, such as street musicians, women bending over in their work, men collecting trash, people in traditional Mexican markets like La Merced, porters, famers and more. The figures in her later work are more generic Westerners rather than Mexican but often the landscapes behind them remain Mexican. Her work has been compared to that of Diego Rivera, Rafael Coronel, and Marysole Wörner Baz.
The focus of her work is not depicting persons or landscapes, but rather to be introspective. The people in her works are anonymous composites which appear in the foreground and other elements usually one or two landscapes, in the background. The people in a work can be a single man or woman, pair or small group of people as they work, play or just exist in a natural setting. There nothing out of the ordinary about the settings but often there is something about the expression or body posture which indicates some kind of tension. She states that her goal is to express the inner emotions people have while in common activities. She has described her work as a “window on an instant”. One example of this is "En el Jardin del Desierto" (In the Garden of the Desert), where a man and woman stand next to each other but separated by the large thorny leaves of the maguey plant, unable to relate Often, as with this painting, the subjects of the works gaze at the onlookers as if to start a dialogue. Her work is narrative although the story may not be clear. They usually relate to relationships, isolation, introspection and readjustment She states that the goal of many of the paintings is to show a crossing, either physically or spiritually to represent personal development. 
Her inspiration comes from observing people, when she can be struck by a look or movement of someone she feels has universal appeal.(synthesis) She has found this inspiration in various parts of Mexico, as well as Scotland and New York. Her paintings reflect her philosophical ideas from her life experiences such as travels, personal encounters, etc. She draws expressions to be understood universally, without cultural reference. “Human emotion crosses every frontier in the world.” said Bickham. “The human condition interests me. We all have such a such a hard time of it.”
As human relationships change, she has experiemented with diptychs and even tritychs, paintings the pieces so that they can be rearranged and still coincide, but in a different way.
She has done some pieces in response to world events, such as the Bosnian War, the uprising in Chiapas and the murders of young women in Ciudad Júarez but does not believe in telling people how to interpret her work. She never paints violence or hate because she does not feel that they are fundamental to human nature, but rather aberrations.
