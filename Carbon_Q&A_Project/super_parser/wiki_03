Acid phosphatase

Acid phosphatase (, "acid phosphomonoesterase", "phosphomonoesterase", "glycerophosphatase", "acid monophosphatase", "acid phosphohydrolase", "acid phosphomonoester hydrolase", "uteroferrin", "acid nucleoside diphosphate phosphatase", "orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (acid optimum)") is a phosphatase, a type of enzyme, used to free attached phosphate groups from other molecules during digestion. It is basically a phosphomonoesterase. It is stored in lysosomes and functions when these fuse with endosomes, which are acidified while they function; therefore, it has an acid pH optimum.
Different forms of acid phosphatase are found in different organs, and their serum levels are used to evaluate the success of the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. In the past, they were also used to diagnose this type of cancer.
Acid phosphatase catalyzes the following reaction at an optimal pH below 7:
Phosphatase enzymes are also used by soil microorganisms to access organically bound phosphate nutrients. An assay on the rates of activity of these enzymes may be used to ascertain biological demand for phosphates in the soil.
Some plant roots, especially cluster roots, exude carboxylates that perform acid phosphatase activity, helping to mobilise phosphorus in nutrient-deficient soils.

Chaenostoma cordatum

Chaenostoma cordatum also known by the name Sutera cordata, Bacopa or Ornamental Bacopa (not to be confused with the genus of that name) is one of 52 species in the genus "Chaenostoma" (Scrophulariaceae), and is best known in its cultivated forms. It originated in southern Africa, and is a tender perennial forming a ground cover, but often used in hanging baskets. Small dark green heart shaped leaves and small round five-petaled white flowers at the branch tips can be found year round, but at its prime in spring.
Cultivation.
"Sutera" 'Cabana', is a short-lived evergreen perennial for zones 9-ll. It grows annually in colder climates, but requires full sun to flower profusely. 
The Pikmin Flower.
It is notable as the source of a breed marketed as "The Pikmin Flower", after the GameCube game "Pikmin". The plant was bred to have a similar appearance as the Pikmin's flowers. Other cultivars include 'Bridal Showers', 'Snowflake', 'Giant Snowflake' and 'Pink Domino'.

Amores (Lucian)

The Erōtes or Amores ("Loves", or "The two kinds of love") is a Greek dialogue, an example of contest literature, comparing the love of women and the love of boys, and concluding that the latter was preferable. The dialogue was transmitted among the works of Lucian. Most modern scholars believe that the style of the dialogue puts into question its authorship. The work is normally cited under the name of "Pseudo-Lucian". The "Erōtes" is also famous for its vivid description of the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles.
The same subject is treated in the "Amatorius" of Plutarch, but with the opposite conclusion.

Mary Prince

Mary Prince (c. 1788-after 1833) was born into slavery in Devonshire Parish, Bermuda. While she was later living in London, her autobiography, "The History of Mary Prince" (1831), was the first account of the life of a black woman to be published in the United Kingdom.
Belonging to the genre of slave narratives, this first-hand description of the brutalities of enslavement, released at a time when slavery was still legal in British Caribbean colonies, had a galvanizing effect on the anti-slavery movement. It went through three printings in the first year. Prince had her account transcribed while living and working in England at the home of Thomas Pringle, secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society. She had gone to London with her master and his family in 1828 from Antigua.
Early life and education.
Mary Prince was born into slavery in Brackish Pond, now known as Devonshire Marsh, Devonshire Parish, Bermuda. Her father (whose only given name was Prince) was a sawyer owned by David Trimmingham, and her mother a house-servant held by Charles Myners. She had three younger brothers and two sisters, Hannah and Dinah. When Myners died in 1788, Mary Prince, her mother and siblings were sold as household servants to Captain Darrell. He gave Mary and her mother to his daughter, with the slave girl becoming the companion servant of his young granddaughter, Betsey Williams.
At the age of 12, Mary was sold for £38 sterling ("2009: £") to Captain John Ingham, of Spanish Point. Her two sisters were sold the same day, each to different masters. Her new master and his wife were cruel, and often lost their temper with the slaves. Mary and other slaves were often severely flogged for minor offenses.
Ingham sold Mary in 1806 to a master on Grand Turk, who owned salt ponds. The Bermudians had used these seasonally for a century for the extraction of salt from the ocean. The production of salt for export was a pillar of the Bermudian economy, but could not easily be produced. Generally men were the salt rakers, forced to work in the salt pans, where they were exposed to the sun and heat, as well as the salt in the pans, which ate away at their uncovered legs. Women did packaging of salt. Mary Prince was returned to Bermuda in 1810, where her master had moved. She was assigned to his daughter, and then for a time hired out to work at Cedar Hill.
In 1815, Mary was sold a fourth time to John Adams Wood of Antigua for $300. She worked for his household as a domestic slave, attending the bed chambers, nursing a young child, and washing clothes. She began to suffer from rheumatism and was unable to work. When her master was traveling, Prince began to earn her own money, by taking in washing, selling coffee, yams and other provisions to ships, and similar ways.
In Antigua she joined the Moravian Church, where she also attended classes and learned to read. She had been baptized in the English church in 1817 and accepted for communion, but she had feared asking her master for permission to go. In December 1826, Prince married Daniel James, a former slave who had bought his freedom by saving money from his work. He worked as a carpenter and cooper. According to her, the master and mistress disapproved of the marriage, claiming they did not want a free black man living at their place. They used her action as one more excuse to beat her.
Travel to England.
In 1828 Wood and his family travelled to London to visit and arrange to take their son to school, and to bring their daughters home to the islands. They took Mary Prince with them as a servant (at her request, they later said). Although slavery was not legally recognised in Britain by this date, and Prince was technically free to leave Wood's household, she had no means to support herself alone in England. Also, unless Wood formally emancipated her, she could not return to her husband in Antigua without being re-enslaved there.
Although she had served the Woods for More than ten years, they had increasing conflict in England. Four times Wood told her to obey or leave. They gave her a letter that nominally gave her the right to leave but suggested that no one should hire her.
After leaving the household, Prince took shelter with the Moravian church in Hatton Garden. Within a few weeks, she started working occasionally for Thomas Pringle, an abolitionist writer, and Secretary to the Anti-Slavery Society, which offered assistance to blacks in need. Prince found work with the Forsyth household, but the couple moved away from England in 1829. The Woods also left England in 1829 and returned with their daughter to Antigua. Pringle tried to arrange to have Wood manumit Prince, so she would have legal freedom.
In 1829 Wood refused either to manumit Mary Prince or allow her to be purchased out of his control. His refusal to sell or free her meant that as long as slavery remained legal in Antigua, Prince could not return to her husband and friends without being re-enslaved and submitting to Wood's power. After trying to arrange a compromise, the Anti-Slavery Committee proposed to petition Parliament to grant Prince's manumission, but did not succeed. At the same time, a bill was introduced to free all slaves from the West Indies in England whose owners had freely brought them there; it did not pass but was an indication of growing anti-slavery sentiment.
Publication of "The History of Mary Prince".
In December 1829, Pringle hired Prince to work in his own household. Encouraged by Pringle, Prince arranged for her life narrative to be transcribed by Susanna Strickland. Pringle served as editor, and her book was published in 1831 as "The History of Mary Prince." The book caused a stir as the first account published in Great Britain of a black woman's life; at a time when anti-slavery agitation was growing, her first person account touched many people. In the first year, it sold out three printings.
Two libel cases arose out of it, and Prince was called to testify at each.
Prince's life after her book was published is not much known. It is not clear whether she ever returned to Antigua and her husband as she had wished.
She is known to have remained in England until at least 1833, when she testified in the two libel cases. That year, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed, to be effective August 1834. The law was intended to achieve a two-staged abolition of West Indian slavery by 1840, allowing the colonies time to transition their economies. Because of popular protests in the West Indies among the freedmen, the colonies legally completed abolition two years early in 1838. In Bermuda, which was not dependent on the institution of slavery, emancipation took place immediately on the law going into effect in 1834. If Prince was still alive and in good health, she may then have returned as a free woman to her homeland.
The book and its influence.
When Prince's book was published, slavery was no longer recognized as legal in Britain, but Parliament had not yet abolished it in the colonies. There was considerable uncertainty about the political and economic repercussions that might arise if Britain imposed an end to slavery throughout the empire, as the sugar colonies depended on it for labour to raise their lucrative commodity crop. As a personal account, the book contributed to the debate in a manner different from reasoned analysis or statistical arguments. Its tone was direct and authentic, and its simple but vivid prose contrasted with the more laboured literary style of the day.
An example is Prince's description of being sold away from her mother at a young age:
"It was night when I reached my new home. The house was large, and built at the bottom of a very high hill; but I could not see much of it that night. I saw too much of it afterwards. The stones and the timber were the best things in it; they were not so hard as the hearts of the owners." 
Prince wrote of slavery with the authority of personal experience, something her political opponents could never match. 
She wrote: 
"I have been a slave myself--I know what slaves feel--I can tell by myself what other slaves feel, and by what they have told me. The man that says slaves be quite happy in slavery--that they don't want to be free--that man is either ignorant or a lying person. I never heard a slave say so. I never heard a Buckra "(white)" man say so, till I heard tell of it in England."
Her book had an immediate effect on public opinion and was published in three editions the first year. It generated controversy, and James Macqueen, the editor of "The Glasgow Courier", challenged its accuracy by a lengthy letter in "Blackwood's Magazine". Macqueen was a defender of white West Indian interests and vigorous critic of the anti-slavery movement. He depicted Prince as a woman of low morals who had been the "despicable tool" of the anti-slavery clique, who had incited her to malign her "generous and indulgent owners." He attacked the character of the Pringle family, suggesting they were at fault for accepting the slave in their household.
In 1833 Pringle sued Macqueen for libel, receiving damages of £5. Not long after, John Wood, Prince's master, sued Pringle for libel, holding him responsible as the editor of Prince's "The History", and claiming the book generally misrepresented his character. Wood won his case and was awarded £25 in damages. Prince was called to testify in both these trials, but little is known of her life afterward.

Extreme Sports Channel

The Extreme Sports Channel (ESC) is a cable, satellite and internet TV channel that launched from Amsterdam on May 1, 1999 with a massive launch party. Founded by Alistair Gosling, the channel delivers the Extreme Sports lifestyle which include surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeboarding, motocross, BMX, FMX, music, art and fashion to millions of fans 24/7 365 days a year in over 60 countries and 12 languages.
History.
In 1997 Al Gosling, an ambassador for Extreme sports and founder of the Extreme Sports TV distribution and production company Extreme Sports Company, realised that this massive part of youth culture had been ignored by mainstream media and realised there were millions of people who would want a channel about these sports and the lifestyle and went out to fill the gap in the market, and provide a channel for this 'undeserved community'. It took him a year of hunting for investment before finding UPCtv, the programming arm of Europe's largest cable television operator UPC.
In April 1998, seeking new channels to offer their subscribers UPCtv's Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Cohen, approached Ben Barret at the MIP programming market in Cannes, France, with a proposal for a joint venture between the two companies. Gosling then drove the negotiations, and with the help from his management team: MD and shareholder Juanjo Márquez[http://www.mediaactionsports.com/index.php/en/], Legal Director Adam Oliver; Head of Sales Ben Barrett, and programming Manager Andy Warkman, the brand was launched in May 1999 from Amsterdam, Holland.
In 1999, The Extreme Sports Company launched its United States operations, and charged veteran producer, Lloyd Bryan Adams with the task of heading up the North American presence. They launched EX TV, a branded block on Fox Sports Net in March 2002.
In 2008, after successfully launching the channel in over sixty countries, Al Gosling's Extreme Sports Company acquired full ownership of the EXTREME brand and sold its stake in the operating channel business for an undisclosed sum to John Malone's Liberty Global Inc. which had by then became owners of UPC. Since this acquisition Extreme Sports Company has become a pioneering brand management and licensing company focused growing the fans and building the brand beyond TV by forming licensing partnerships with companies that want to drive their growth by delivering EXTREME branded consumer products, services and experiences for the fans who are passionate about the brand, the sports, the music and the lifestyle. To date electronics; destinations, hotels, fashion, video gaming, publishing, drinks have launched or are launching during 2013 and 2014 in multiple territories.
Demand for these products and services comes from the brand awareness from the channel and marketing that is carried out which include: 78 ambassadors, 43 events, social media activation 560k Facebook.com/Extreme fans, the consumer insights and the trend led creative assets.
Coverage.
ESC broadcasts to over 60 countries with 12 different language soundtracks, and is generally available on digital cable as well as on many digital satellite packages, including UPC Direct in the Czech Republic, Cyfra+ and Cyfrowy Polsat in Poland, Kabel Deutschland in Germany and Canal Digital in Norway and in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Levant territories broadcasting via satellite, exclusively from the OSN pay-TV network.
Content from the channel is also narrowcast on Cabvision installed in London Black cabs. The UK version of the channel was free-to-air from launch in 2001 until Summer 2006, when a deal with BSkyB meant that it became encrypted.
ESC's on-air broadcast transmissions are handled by Chellomedia's playout and post production facility (the Digital Media centre) in Amsterdam..
On 28 September 2011 the channel began broadcasting in widescreen (16:9) format.
On 1 February 2012 the channel began broadcasting in Italy, only in the HD version.

2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)

The 2nd Armoured Division was a British Army formation during the Second World War; it was created on 15 December 1939 and disbanded on 10 May 1941, after most of the division was captured at Mechili in Libya by German and Italian forces.
History.
This division had a short and unlucky history; formed in December 1939, it wasn't until the following month that it received any troops to command - when the 1st Light Armoured Brigade and the 22nd Heavy Armoured Brigade were assigned. Similarly, the 2nd Support Group was formed in February, but no troops were assigned until March. As the 1st Armoured Division had priority for equipment, the 2nd was forced to use whatever was available. The 1st Armoured Brigade, with its 150-odd Mk VI light tanks, was the most combat-ready element of the division during most of 1940. The 22nd Armoured Brigade was forced to make do with trucks and a few light tanks.
As the threat of invasion receded after the Battle of Britain, the division was reorganized and reinforced for service in the Middle East. It exchanged the 22nd Armoured Brigade for the 1st Armoured Division's veteran 3rd Armoured Brigade and then the brigades exchanged regiments to ensure that each had both cruisers and light tanks.
The following table lists tank strengths before departure in October 1940:
In addition, both brigade headquarters (as well as the division headquarters) had three Mk VI light tanks and seven cruiser tanks (mainly A 10s).
In early 1941, the division was sent to the Western Desert to reinforce troops under General Wavell, who, at the time, was on the verge of defeating the Italian forces. Unaware that Germany had sent reinforcements to support the Italians in Cyrenaica, Wavell's superiors ordered him to send half his troops to Greece, including the 1st Armoured Brigade and elements from the 2nd Support Group. Rommel's offensive forced Wavell's troops to retreat. Unfortunately, on 8 April 1941, the understrength 2nd Armoured Division was caught in a pincer movement by the Italian 10th Bersaglieri Regiment, the 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer Division - some elements escaped capture and were evacuated from Tobruk. On 10 May 1941, the division was officially disbanded and not reformed.
The 2nd Armoured Division also had an RAMC Brigade, but World War II records identifying the unit number are currently unavailable.
Following re-organisation, 2nd Infantry Division was reformed as an armoured formation in I (BR) Corps in Germany from 1976 to 1983. In this incarnation, it had two armoured regiments, each nominally with 74 tanks, and three mechanised infantry battalions, and probably incorporated Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. Following further reorganisation in 1983, it was converted back into an infantry division.
General Officers Commanding.
The 2nd Armoured Division had five General Officers Commanding during its Second World War existence, with the final officer being taken prisoner.
The Division had three General Officers Commanding during its existence in the late 1970s and early 1980s:

Archibald McLean (judge)

Chief Justice The Hon. Archibald McLean (April 5, 1791 – October 24, 1865) was a lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada.
Early life.
McLean was born at St. Andrews in the Lunenburg District in 1791, the son of Lt.-Col. The Hon. Neil McLean and Isabella McDonell of Leek. He studied at John Strachan's school in Cornwall and articled in law with William Firth.
War of 1812.
On the outbreak of the War of 1812 he joined the 2nd Regiment of York Militia as a Subaltern and was seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights. He was carried from the battlefield to a nearby village by John Cawthra where his wounds were hurriedly dressed. Because of an infection caused by the late removal of a bullet he was not fit to fight when the Americans attacked York in April, 1813. McLean buried the York militia’s colours in the woods and escaped to Kingston, Ontario. He fought again at Battle of Lundy's Lane, but was captured by the Americans and held prisoner for the remainder of the war.
Politics.
In 1815 he turned down a commission into the British regular army, joining the law firm of William Warren Baldwin before starting his own lucrative law firm in Cornwall, Ontario. In 1820, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Stormont; he held that seat until 1834, shared for the previous four years with his old school friend Philip VanKoughnet. He was then elected to represent Cornwall and became Speaker of the Assembly in 1836. He was a leading Tory member and advocated the rights of the Presbyterian Church to be equal to those of the Church of England.
Upper Canada Rebellion.
He was named colonel in the militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion and commanded the left flank of the loyalist forces under Colonel James FitzGibbon at the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern. McLean initially opposed the Union of Upper and Lower Canada out of fear that Upper Canadians would be dominated by French Canadians. He saw responsible government as a danger to the British connection and to the ordered freedom and the recognition of class and property of the British tradition, but he quickly adjusted to the new reality.
Judicial career.
Appointed to the Legislative Council in 1836, the following year he was named to the Court of King's Bench, his brother Alexander McLean taking his Stormont seat. From 1850 to 1856, he served in the Court of Common Pleas with Sir James Buchanan Macaulay and Robert Baldwin Sullivan. 
In the Extradition case of John Anderson, the fugitive slave, McLean argued that 'in administering the laws of a British province, I can never feel bound to recognize as law any enactment which can convert into chattels a very large number of the human race.' 
In 1862, he was appointed chief justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench for Upper Canada. In 1863, he was appointed judge of the Court of Error and Appeal. For many years McLean had served as president of the St Andrew’s Society of Toronto.
He married Joan McPherson and they were the parents of seven children. He died in Toronto in 1865 and was honoured with a public funeral. The Upper Canada Law Journal wrote, 
"Upon the bench was dignified and courteous; unsuspicious and utterly devoid of anything mean or petty in his own character, his conduct to others was always what he expected from them."

Tatsinskaya Raid

The Tatsinskaya Raid was a Soviet armoured raid deep into the German rear conducted by 24th Tank Corps under the command of Major General Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov in late December 1942, during the last phases of the Battle of Stalingrad (Operation Little Saturn). It was designed to force the Germans to divert forces attempting to relieve the 6th Army trapped in Stalingrad. The Soviet force captured its objective, the Luftwaffe's airfield at Tatsinskaya, destroying over 72 aircraft on the ground, but was left cut off and without supplies. Despite the loss of most of the tank corps during the ensuing breakout, the raid was a great operational victory.
Background.
The Red Army had encircled the Wehrmacht's 6th Army in Stalingrad with Operation Uranus, begun on 19 November 1942. By the middle of December, the German relief effort, Operation Winter Storm, reached within 48 km of the encirclement ring, and the airlift trying to supply the encircled army was in full swing. In this situation, STAVKA decided to launch Operation Little Saturn, to encircle all of German Army Group A, by penetrating to the south and the coast of the Sea of Azov. The danger this operation created was so serious that the German command had to give up any hope of relieving the 6th Army, and instead turned its attention to fighting the advancing Red Army formations, while simultaneously trying to move as many formations as possible to the west. As a consequence of the threat, the most potent of the German divisions involved in the relief effort, 6th Panzer Division, was turned west, and ordered to first clear the raiding force from Tatsinskaya, and later to establish a new frontline towards the north of the airfield. With that decision, any hope of breaking through to 6th Army had vanished.
The battle.
Soviet planning.
24th Tank Corps belonged to 3rd Guards Army, which was commanded by General D.D. Lelyushenko, which was a part of the Southwestern Front under the command of N.F. Vatutin. The corps was designated as the army's exploitation force, in line with the doctrine of Deep Battle. It was therefore not to be committed during the initial breaching of the tactical defenses of Axis forces in the sector, but would be committed once a breach in these defenses had been opened.
The assault by 3rd Guards Army commenced during the morning of 16 December 1942. In order to accelerate the breaching of the Axis tactical defense by his rifle formations, Lelyushenko committed the other two tank corps available to him (17th and 25th Tank Corps) during the initial phase of the battle. 
24th Tank Corps was ordered to commence its operation at 1130 hours on 17 December. At this stage, 17th and 25th Tank Corps had already reached the operational depth and were in the process of encircling Italian 8th Army and battling the forces of Army Detachment Hollidt. 25th Tank Corps later conducted a deep raid towards Morozovskaya to the east of Tatsinskaya. The purpose of the two deep raids was to cut off the German formations conducting Operation Winterstorm, the relief attempt for the German 6th Army.
The raid.
The raid was aimed at the German Luftwaffe's airfield at Tatsinskaya, from which a major part of the Stalingrad relief airlift was conducted. On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1942, they captured the airfield with an attack from three sides. The airfield may not have received a warning, since flight operations were still going on. An eyewitness account by a Soviet officer describes the scene: 
Our tank detachments unexpectedly broke into Tatsinski military airport. First to penetrate enemy's territory was captain Nechaev's battalion. A tough fight between tanks and enemy artillery began. Germans were shooting grenades at the Russian tanks and managed to blow up several of them. However the Soviet tank crews broke the Nazi defense. After they destroyed patrol forces, Russian soldiers started shooting German pilots that rushed to their planes desperately hoping to save their lives.
24th Tank Corps claimed the destruction of over 300 planes on the airfield, while German estimates were 72 were actually destroyed or almost 10% of the transport capacity of the Luftwaffe. The airfield defenses were quickly overrun, and while over 100 transport planes managed to escape, German losses were heavy. As the tanks were low on ammunition, almost all of the planes destroyed were rammed by the tanks. A number of planes were destroyed while still on railway cars on which they had arrived. Once the airfield was seized however, 24th Tank Corps was cut off, and found itself without supplies deep inside the German lines.
German reaction.
Already while the battle for the airfield and the town were going on, it became clear to Badanov that he had been cut off, when march columns of his 24th Motorized Brigade were followed from the north by German forces. On 26 December, the last elements of 24th Motorized Brigade managed to break through the encirclement to join the main body of the corps. Field Marshal Erich von Manstein had meanwhile ordered the XLVIII Panzer Corps to move towards the deep penetrations the Red Army had achieved with the 11th Panzer Division and 6th Panzer Division. From 26 December, the two divisions had cut off completely the connection between 24th Tank Corps and 1st Guards Army. Towards the north, a mixed Kampfgruppe blocked the road against other Red Army formations that might come to the assistance of 24th Tank Corps. The German command also brought up the 579th Infantry Regiment of the 306th Infantry Division and three armoured trains: PZ 10a, 10b and 28. Together, these forces launched an attack with the aim of destroying 24th Tank Corps.
STAVKA reacted by ordering the Front command to assist Badanov's force. The available units were 25th Tank Corps, which had been reduced to 25 tanks by heavy combat, and 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, which had incurred losses too. They were reinforced with infantry, but did not manage to break through to Tatsinskaya. This led to the need for Badanov and his surviving men to break out to escape destruction, and permission to do so was given on 28 December. Most of the matériel and many men were lost during the break-out, but the damage to the Germans had been done. German forces engaged in the relief of Stalingrad had to be withdrawn to deal with the raiders, and many invaluable transport planes of the Luftwaffe had been destroyed, with their crews and ground personnel mostly killed. 24th Tank Corps claimed the destruction of 84 tanks, 106 guns, the killing of 12,000 Axis soldiers and the capture of almost 5,000 more in this operation.
Analysis.
Despite the loss of most of the tank corps, the raid was a great operational success. 24th Tank Corps operated up to 150 miles (240 km) from its supply base, and had to rely on captured supplies to keep operational. The follow-on rifle troops were not mobile enough to keep up, allowing the Germans to cut off the connection between the raiding force and its base, and ultimately defeat the operational intent of cutting off a large part of the German forces in the region.
Despite this, the raid for the first time in the war had pushed a strong formation deep into the rear of mobile German formations, forcing the German command to adapt its own operational plans. Previous raids had been by much weaker cavalry or airborne forces operating with partisans, and these had not been able to inflict as much damage. 
Much was learned by the Soviet command from the raid, and it probably gave further impetus to create the new tank armies as independent formations capable of conducting sustained operations deep in the enemy rear. The almost complete loss of the equipment and that of many of the personnel of 24th Tank Corps also brought home the truth that operating so deep behind enemy lines carried exceptional risks.
Recognition.
STAVKA was quick in recognising the exceptional achievement of 24th Tank Corps. Major General Badanov became the first recipient of the newly created Order of Suvorov for this operation, and quickly went on to command 4th Tank Army later in the war, which he led in Operation Kutuzov in July 1943. From 1944 onwards, he commanded the Red Army Armoured School, and he rose to the rank of lieutenant-general. 
During the raid, 24th Tank Corps was renamed 2nd Guards Tank Corps and given the honorific title 'Tatsinskaya' to honour of its achievement. It later played a key role in the Battle of Prokhorovka, as well as many other important operations during the remainder of the war.
Captain Nechaev, commander of the last tanks of the tank corps was made a posthumous Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions.

24th Tank Corps.
The strength of the corps was 90% of tanks provided for in the TO&E for a total of 159 tanks, 50% of motor transport, and 70% of personnel. The Corps was supplied with two units of ammunition, two units of fuel and lubricants, and five days of rations.
Reinforcements attached to the corps for the raid:
Air support was provided by 3rd Composite Air Corps of 17th Air Army, through an aerial liaison officer travelling with the HQ of the 24th Tank Corps.
Trivia.
In the game , the last two Soviet missions are at Tatsinskaya in which, in a T-34 tank, the player attacks the station, then move onto the airfield then finally assault the last Germans at the Control tower. In a nod to the true story of the raid, the player's character is a tank commander named Nikolai Badanov.

Underwater navigation

Underwater navigation is the common reference term for navigation techniques learned by Scuba divers in order to navigate in an underwater environment.
Although it is considered a basic skill, it is normally only taught to a limited degree as part of basic Open Water certification. Most North American diver training agencies only teach significant elements of underwater navigation as part of the Advanced Open Water Diver certification program.
Underwater navigation is usually a core component of most, if not all, advanced diver training. In the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course, it is one of the two mandatory skills (together with Deep diving) which must be taken alongside three elective skills.
Training agencies promote underwater navigation as a skill (despite the fact that it is less popular than other recreational diving specialties) on the basis that it:
Underwater navigation is a component of the scuba-based underwater sport, underwater orienteering.
Navigation techniques.
Underwater navigation in recreational diving is broadly split into two categories. "Natural navigation" techniques, and "orienteering", which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater magnetic compass.
Natural navigation, sometimes known as pilotage, involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise. Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.
Orienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically depencant on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an impeller log, to pacing off the distance alond the bottom with the arms.
Many skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position.
Navigation using Natural Features.
Landmarks.
Recognisable topographical features may be remembered or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility is sufficient to see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, shot lines, jackstays and cave lines.
Depth and depth variation.
The slope of the bottom is often a reliable indicator of the direction toward the shore, particularly when the bottom is of soft or loose material, and is not broken up greatly by rocky outcrops. This information can be checked for reliability on a sufficiently detailed chart of the area. Contours of depth running roughly parallel to the coastline indicate a slope dipping directly away from the shore, and can be used to maintain a sense of distance and orientation relative to the shore. In some places where the bottom is composed of predominantly rocky outcrops the slope may be in any direction and is not a reliable indicator of direction.
Angle of the sun, changes in light level.
If circumstances of depth and water clarity allow the position of the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, the depth fairly shallow and the surface fairly smooth.
In some circumstances the diver can look up at the surface, to see in which direction the land lies. These cues will not give any precise information about position, but will allow the diver to keep a mental picture of where he or she is and is going.
Current, wave and surge direction.
Current direction can be useful as an orientation cue as long as the direction of the current is known. In rivers it tends to be fairly consistent and reliable, though localised eddies may occur. In the sea it may depend on weather conditions and local topography, as well as the state of the tide. In estuaries and harbours the currents will usually be predominantly tidal, so the state of the tide must be known, as the difference in direction between ebb and flow is usually about 180°.
Surge direction is essentially the same as wave direction, but may be felt at depths where the wave direction is no longer visible. It is useful if the offshore wave direction relative to the shore is known and does not change appreciably during the dive. In shallow water the wave crests will often be parallel to the shore. The important difference is that waves can be seen to travel in a definite direction, whereas surge is a back and forth motion, allowing a possible 180° error.
Ripple patterns on a sand bottom.
A regular and distinct ripple pattern on a sand, mud or gravel bottom is an indication that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a ripple pattern on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the ripple pattern. When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests. 
Ripple crests, like surge, may be interpreted with a 180° error.
Dip and Strike of bedrock.
Many rock formations have characteristic angles known as dip and strike. Dip is the slope of the strata from the horizontal, and Strike is the general direction of the strata in the horizontal plane (very roughly). These characteristics will usually be similar in the rocks above and below the water in a locality, so they can be used to estimate direction. Ridges above and below water are often parallel, and gullies and valleys may well extend under water for considerable distances.
Ecological variations.
Different areas may for a wide variety of reasons have different ecologies. When you become familiar with an area you may use the diversity variations and patterns to provide orientation cues. There are few general rules that are useful here, and you have to get to know the area.
There is often variation of ecological zoning with depth, but a diver is expected to be aware of his depth all the time anyway. In some places the seaward side of big rocks may have different species because of the greater exposure to wave action.
Sea fans, Gorgonians, and sponges are filter feeders, and may grow into a fan shape at right angles to the usual current or surge direction, to get the maximum volume of water flowing past them.
Compass navigation.
How a compass works.
The magnetic compass indicates the local direction of the ambient magnetic field, which is usually that of the Earth. This is usually a reliable and consistent feature and is very useful as a navigational aid as it is not affected by visibility, pressure, or the presence of water.
An important concept is that the compass card should not turn, even though it appears to always “swing” to magnetic north. The housing that holds the compass card turns around the card, which remains pointing in the same direction (Magnetic North) all the time. There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field.
True or geographic north.
True north is the geometrically accurate direction along the surface of the earth toward the North pole of the planet’s axis of rotation.
The lines of longitude on maps are in true North/South directions.
Magnetic north and variation.
The Earth has a magnetic field which is not quite in line with the geographic directions. The difference between the magnetic and true directions is known as Variation. It differs from place to place and changes with time. Large scale charts and maps will usually include a compass rose showing variation.
Compass north and deviation.
The compass will indicate the magnetic field direction at the place where it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the Earth’s magnetic field, these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called deviation, and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any magnetic object or electrical current will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a dive computer is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive compass for deviation caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, steel cylinders can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A diver propulsion vehicle with an electric motor is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navogate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error.
Deviation may be checked by comparing the compass bearing as measured with a known magnetic bearing measured by a compass with no deviation.
Deviation may vary with different directions and for accurate work it is necessary to make up a table of deviations. This is done for ships, but for diving it is generally not worth the trouble. Bearings of one diver's compass may vary from those of another diver even if they have both been read correctly. The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together.
Dip.
The magnetic field of the earth is tilted from the horizontal. The angle is called dip and varies with place, so compasses can be corrected for different zones. This is a factory process. A compass made for the northern parts of the northern hemisphere will tilt badly in the southern hemisphere, in some cases to the extent that it will jam if held horizontal.
Surface navigation for diving.
Surface applications for compass navigation include marking a position and finding the position using compass bearings. At least two position lines are required to fix a position, as only direction can be found using a compass. When two bearings are used a large angle between the bearings will minimize error. The angle should preferably be between 60 and 120 degrees, and near 90 degrees would be ideal. Three bearings are better as they will also give an indication of probable accuracy when plotted on a chart. The "cocked hat" or triangle where the lines intersect, shows the probable location of the position measured, and a small triangle indicates a small probable error. The angle between the three bearings should preferably be in the order of 60 or 120 degrees where available landmarks allow. In all cases landmarks should be as close to the diver as possible and spread over a large arc for best accuracy.
Equipment.
Various pieces of equipment have developed to assist divers navigating underwater.
Periodically reports are issued suggesting the development of underwater GPS technology, but no system is currently available on market. It is generally thought that the difficulty of locating satellite by signals from underwater at present is not capable of being overcome by existing technology.
Underwater Compasses.
Construction.
The typical diving compass is made from a card with graduation in degrees, mounted on a pivot in a transparent housing filled with fluid which damps the movement and prevents pressure collapse of the housing. It may be wrist mounted, console mounted or carried some other way. It is desirable that the compass can operate accurately at significant tilt angles without sticking.
On the card there is a magnet which will interact with the ambient magnetic field so as to align itself and the card with the field. There will be other marks on the housing which should be aligned with the user, so the offset of the card to the housing will indicate the direction of the magnetic field and the orientation of the user.
Important features of a diving compass are that you can easily read it in dim light, the card or needle does not easily jam if the housing is tilted slightly, and that it can be securely attached to your arm or equipment and does not get lost. It is useful to be able to adjust any straps while wearing gloves, and any clips you may attach should be non-magnetic.
The strap should be long enough to go round your wrist over wet suit or dry suit and glove, and if it is slightly elastic it will stay in place when the suit compresses.
There may be a movable bezel which can be set to record a course and to help set a reciprocal course.
There are also electronic compasses which can provide a digital or analogue display These are based on magnetometer technology.
Direct and Indirect reading compasses.
There are two ways in which a compass may be marked, which influence the way you would read them. These are known as Direct reading compasses and Indirect reading compasses. Both provide the same information to the same level of accuracy.
The direct reading compass has graduations on the housing which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero on the far side. 
The effect of this configuration is that if the housing is aligned with a direction, the north point of the card or needle will point directly towards the number representing the bearing. No further effort is needed on the part of the operator, you just find the number the arrow points at and read off the bearing. 
The bezel has no graduations, it is just a marker to align the card.
The indirect reading compass has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise round the face, and the zero mark coincides with the notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read at the far side of the compass.
Both types may have graduations on the card which can be read through a side window to give the bearing directly

Duke of Tetuan

Duke of Tetuan ("Duque de Tetuán") is a hereditary title in the Spanish nobility. As with all Spanish dukedoms, it is accompanied by the Grandeeship of Spain 1st Class. The dukedom of Tetuan was granted by Queen Isabella II to General Leopoldo O'Donnell y Joris, 1st Count of Lucena. It was conferred upon him in 27 March 1860, shortly after the Battle of Tetuan in the Spanish-Moroccan War, as a victory title.
It has been held since its creation by members of the O'Donnell family, as the 5th Duchess, Blanca O'Donnell, died without issue of her marriage to Guillermo Pelizaeus. If they had had children, the dukedom would have gone out of the family.

UniVBE

UniVBE (short for Universal VESA BIOS Extensions) is a software driver that allows DOS applications written to the VESA BIOS standard to run on almost any display device made in the last 15 years or so. 
The UniVBE driver was written by SciTech Software and is also available in their product called SciTech Display Doctor.
The primary benefit is increased compatibility and performance with DOS games. Many video cards have sub-par implementations of the VESA standards, or no support at all. UNIVBE replaces the card's built-in support. Many DOS games include a version of UNIVBE because VESA issues were so widespread.
According to SciTech Software Inc, SciTech Display Doctor is licensed by IBM as the native graphics driver solution for OS/2.[http://www.scitechsoft.com/about/about.html]
History.
The software started out as The Universal VESA TSR (UNIVESA), written by Kendall Bennett. It was renamed to Universal VESA BIOS Extensions (UniVBE) in version 5, which supports VBE/Core 2.0, and no longer a freeware.
In version 5.2, it was renamed to Scitech Display Doctor. However, UniVBE continued to be the name used for the actual driver.
Version 6 included support of VBE/Core 3.0, VBE/SCI.
Version 6.5 introduced the ability to use Scitech Display Doctor as wrapper video driver.
Version 7 supports VESA/MCCS, and included Scitech GLDirect, an OpenGL emulator. This version was also ported to OS/2 and Linux (as version 1.0). However, the proposed product has never been widely available. Only pre-releases are available to public. In the Windows SDD prerelease, it included DOS UniVBE driver 7.20 beta, the Scitech Nucleus Graphics driver, GLDirect 2.0 and 3.0 beta. SDD 7 was first released on OS/2 on 2002-02-28, followed by Windows beta on 2002-03-01.
SciTech Display Doctor 7.1 marked the final release of SDD, which was available on OS/2, among other operating systems. However, the Scitech Nucleus Graphics engine lived on as SciTech SNAP (System Neutral Access Protocol) Graphics, SciTech SNAP DDC, and SciTech VBE Test Suite 8.0.[http://www.scoug.com/OS24U/2002/scoug209.download.html] Unlike UniVBE, SciTech SNAP Graphics is designed as fully accelerated binary compatible graphic device driver, rather than patching a GPU BIOS to be VESA-compliant.
Display Doctor is no longer supported by SciTech Software. SciTech Display Doctor 5.3a, SciTech Display Doctor 6.53, and UniVBE 6.7 were available on their FTP site, but as of 2009-10-04, the FTP site no longer seems to be available; this seems to be related to the acquisition of SciTech Software by Alt Richmond Inc. 2008-12. Please see the SciTech SNAP article for more details.
One attempt to provide an alternative to SciTech's products was FreeBE/AF, but the last release was 1999-06-27.
Compatibility.
UniVBE requires a video card with at least 512 KB of memory.
Although UniVBE has supported many controllers, the quality of VESA support decayed in newer incarnations, especially for owners with older hardware. In the case of newer GPUs, the video cards that use them have begun to incorporate rewritable firmware, which allows video card manufacturers to offer better VBE patches than SciTech can supply, especially for cards using Matrox processors.
UniVBE does not add 16-colour screen modes or text modes, but offers an option to reuse those modes with a "pass through feature." However, the text mode pass through feature has been broken since the release of SDD 6.
Matrox G-series video cards can only use video modes that utilize at most half of its memory. This is different from the Matrox Millennium, which was documented by SciTech as a hardware flaw.

Bradley Allen

Bradley James Allen (born 13 September 1971) is an English former footballer who is currently an academy coach at Tottenham Hotspur.
As a player, Allen played as a forward from 1988 to 2004, making Premier League appearances for both Queens Park Rangers and Charlton Athletic. He also made Football League appearances for Colchester United, Grimsby Town, Peterborough United and Bristol Rovers. He represented England at under-21 level, earning eight caps and scoring two goals.
Club career.
Queens Park Rangers.
Born in Harold Wood, London, Allen began his career with Queens Park Rangers, where he signed professionally in 1988 during the tenure of Jim Smith, although Smith was replaced by Trevor Francis mid-way through Allen's first professional season. Over the coming years, he went from strength to strength and began to see regular runs in the first-team. During the inaugural Premier League season in 1992–93 season, Allen played six times and scored twice, once in a 1–1 draw with Chelsea in January 1993 and the winner during a 2–1 win against Aston Villa at Loftus Road in May 1993. Allen was eventually placed on the transfer list during the ill-fated 1995–96 season in which Rangers were relegated. In total, Allen scored 27 goals in 81 league games for QPR.
Charlton Athletic.
First Division Charlton Athletic paid £400,000 for Allen's services in March 1996. He scored six goals in 21 appearances in the league and League Cup in his first full season with the club but chances became harder to come by for Allen, as he made only 14 first-team appearances and could net only two goals during the 1997–98 season as Charlton were promoted to the Premier League. He then made only one appearance for the club in the 1998–99 season, and then joined Division Two side Colchester United in February 1999. This spelt the end of his time with Charlton, having scored nine goals in 40 league appearances.
Colchester United loan.
Recruited by Colchester manager Mick Wadsworth, Allen made his debut for the U's in a 1–1 home draw with Reading on 27 February 1999, before being replaced by Steve Forbes after 68 minutes. He scored one goal while on loan with the club, a 40th minute equaliser during a 2–2 draw with Oldham Athletic on 9 March. Allen made four appearances in total during his short stay at Layer Road.
Grimsby Town.
Allen was placed on the transfer list at Charlton and transferred to Grimsby Town in the summer of 1999, who at the time plied their trade in the First Division under Alan Buckley. He scored nine goals in 36 games in all competitions in the 1999–2000 season but found himself limited to just 25 appearances in the 2000–01 season, being limited by injuries and only managing to score six goals. The 2001–02 season saw a return of 5 goals in 31 games, but his injury record and Grimsby's financial plight saw Allen released at the end of the season. He ended his Grimsby stay with 15 goals in 80 league games.
Peterborough United.
Allen joined Peterborough United on trial in the summer of 2002, where he featured in a friendly against Rushden & Diamonds. However, he initially delayed joining the club and also refused offers from Bristol Rovers, Conference promotion hopefuls Doncaster Rovers and Cyprus-based club APOEL Nicosia. He then had an unsuccessful trial spell with Brighton & Hove Albion before signing for Peterborough on 29 August 2002. Allen scored three goals in 11 games for the Posh but Peterborough chairman Barry Fry confirmed that his short-term contract would not be renewed when it expired in December 2002. Having been linked with a move to Carlisle United.
Bristol Rovers.
Bristol Rovers signed Allen in November 2002 from Peterborough following the expiry of his short-term contract. He made eight appearances in the league for the club and scored one goal against Cambridge United, as he was released at the end of the 2002–03 season. He also scored once in the FA Cup against Rochdale.
Hornchurch.
Ambitious Isthmian League club Hornchurch signed Allen in September 2003 following trials with a number of clubs. He was one of a number of former professional players with Football League experience in a squad that knocked League side Darlington out of the FA Cup in 2003. However, with the club facing financial turmoil, Hornchurch began releasing players during the 2003–04 season, with Allen one of the squad members released.
Redbridge.
Following his release from Hornchurch, Allen quickly joined Conference South side Ford United, who would later change name to become Redbridge. Having scored on his debut, his stint did not last long, and was subsequently released in July 2004, with club manager Craig Edwards stating that the club would prefer "to go with younger players" for the coming season and that there were financial implications. Allen then joined Billericay Town on trial, scoring in a pre-season friendly against Grays Athletic.
International career.
Allen represented England at youth level and earned eight caps at under-21 level, where he scored twice.
Coaching career.
After retiring from the game in 2004, Allen became a PE teacher and became an academy coach at Tottenham Hotspur, where he is currently running the under-15 side. In addition to his coaching, Allen has worked in the media, providing co-commentary for Sky Sports Football First programme and also for radio coverage.
BBC London.
Bradley is a regular co-commentator on BBC London 94.9 usually alongside Phil Parry.
Personal life.
Allen comes from a famous footballing family. He is the son of former Chelsea, Tottenham and QPR player and manager Les Allen. His brother is former England international Clive Allen and his nephew is former Barnet player Oliver Allen. His uncle, Dennis Allen played over 300 league games for Reading, and his cousin Martin Allen has managed a number of Football League clubs, alongside representing QPR and West Ham United.

Bob Davoli

Bob Davoli is an American venture capitalist at Sigma Partners in Boston, Massachusetts.
Education.
Davoli obtained a history degree from Ricker College and held a variety of early jobs, including as a substitute teacher in Boston’s public schools. As he considered his career options, Davoli began to study computer software by taking courses at Northeastern University.
Career.
In 1981 he started working for Stone and Webster, and in 1986 he founded a database consulting firm, D & N Systems, with a partner, Dave Newsom. In January 1990, in Davoli’s first successful high-tech exit, D & N Systems was acquired by Sybase a few months before that company went public. D & N Systems changed its name to SQL Solutions, and Davoli stayed on to run it as a separate operating subsidiary. 
In 1992, Davoli was recruited to become CEO of Epoch Systems, a Sigma Partners portfolio company with a hierarchical storage management product. In 1993 Davoli sold Epoch Systems to EMC Corporation for $140 million. This solidified Davoli’s reputation as a successful entrepreneur and CEO. Davoli left Epoch / EMC about a year after the acquisition, and started doing angel investing and advising local startups. 
At about this time, Charles Ferguson had founded Vermeer Technologies which was in the process of creating FrontPage, new and innovative software for creating web pages. Ferguson was seeking out the best advisors he could find in the area, and was recommended to Davoli, who joined the Vermeer board as an independent director. Vermeer was purchased by Microsoft in January 1996 for $130m.
Between the fact that Epoch Systems had been a Sigma company, and that Wade Woodson of Sigma had been the lead investor in the first round of investment in Vermeer, Davoli was now well known at the VC firm. He was recruited to join the Sigma team in 1995, on a track to become a full partner in the firm.
Once on board at Sigma Partners, Davoli started funding some of the most successful technology companies to emerge in the Boston area in the mid to late 1990s. Many of these were founded by entrepreneurs who had emerged from the two companies of which he had been CEO: D & N Systems / SQL Solutions and from Epoch Systems. Since D & N Systems / SQL Solutions was an early strong player in the relational database field, and Epoch Systems was in a similar position in hierarchical storage management, they were both natural breeding grounds from which strong startups would emerge. 
Incidentally, one of Davoli’s greatest investment successes, Vignette Corporation, was founded by two ex-Epoch Systems employees, Ross Garber and Neil Webber, but had nothing to do with computer storage. Garber and Webber sought out Davoli to provide seed investment funds to start their company, but did not even really know what they were going to do. With Davoli’s blessing, and some of Sigma’s money, Vignette got started and developed into a fabulously successful investment in the new field of content management software. 
Davoli has invested in many other successful companies across the USA, including Internet Security Systems, m-Qube, StorageNetworks, Octane Software, TRADEX and new investments Rave Wireless and Recycle Bank. He has been listed several times on Forbes Magazine's exclusive "Midas" list and is seen as one of the top early-stage IT venture capitalists in the country. 
Davoli’s investing style is to back smart entrepreneurs with a great deal of energy and capability, and good knowledge about the arena in which they are starting their business. Unlike some other investors, Davoli is very comfortable investing in services businesses, such as Virtusa, Glasshouse Technologies and m-Qube.
Personal.
Outside his investing activities, Davoli has many other interests. He is an oenophile, and has taken this as far as completing a diploma program in Wine Studies at Boston University. Davoli is on the board of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts and is an eclectic collector of modern art. He is an active philanthropist and political donor, supporting many charitable as well as Democratic and liberal causes. Finally, Davoli is a musician who studies and plays country blues, country and jazz guitar, and takes great pride in his growing collection of guitars.
Davoli is married to Eileen McDonagh, a professor of Political Science at Northeastern University.

Yamaha XJ900

The Yamaha XJ900 was borne of the original Yamaha XJ model motorcycle, the XJ 650, which was the foundation for the entire XJ series.
In its original incarnation launched in 1983, the XJ900 had an air-cooled, double overhead camshaft, 853 cc 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 8-valve engine. Originally fitted with a handlebar mounted bikini fairing, its handling came in for criticism. This was quickly replaced with a frame mounted upper fairing and retrofitted to all models. The 1983 XJ900 came with anti-dive front forks, shaft drive and has triple disc brakes (2 front, 1 rear).
A revised version was launched in 1984 and displaced 891 cc. Aside from the engine capacity increase it was equipped with more conventional forks than its predecessor and a belly pan came as standard. The increase in engine capacity meant the carburettors went up from 35 mm to 36 mm. Fuel capacity is 22 litres and the transmission is a 5 speed with a top speed of around 200km/h. Aside from these changes it was nearly identical to the original and was manufactured until 1994.
The XJ900 Diversions were their replacements.

Barbarea vulgaris

Barbarea vulgaris, also called as bittercress, herb barbara, rocketcress, yellow rocketcress, winter rocket, and wound rocket, is a biennial herb of the genus "Barbarea", belonging to the family "Brassicaceae".
Etymology.
The genus name "Barbarea" derives from Saint Barbara, the patron saint of artillerymen and miners, as this plant in the past was used to soothe the wounds caused by explosions. The species Latin name "vulgaris" means “common”.
Characteristics.
Chemical substances in this species include saponins, flavonoids, and glucosinolates.
Natural insect resistance and its potential use in agriculture.
Most "Barbarea vulgaris" genotypes are naturally resistant to some insect species that are otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In the case of diamondback moth ("Plutella xylostella") and the flea beetle "Phyllotreta nemorum", the resistance is caused by saponins. Glucosinolates such as glucobarbarin and glucobrassicin are used as a cue for egg-laying by female cabbage white butterflies such as "Pieris rapae". Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly thrive well on this plant. Diamond back moth females are also stimulated by these chemicals, but the larvae die due to the content of saponins which are apparently not sensed by the moths. This phenomenon has been tested for biological insect control: "B. vulgaris" plants are placed in a field and attract much of the diamondback moth egg load. As the larvae die shortly after hatching, this kind of insect control has been named "dead-end trap cropping".
Distribution.
Native to Eurasia it is naturalised in many parts of North America as a weed.
Habitat.
The plant prefers fresh or moist places, on roadsides, along rivers, or on the slopes and in ditches, at an altitude of above sea level.
Natural chemotypes with distinct ecology.
A pubescent type (the "P-type") has been described from S. Scandinavia. This type has atypical chemistry and is devoid of resistance to the diamondback moth and the flea beetle "Phyllotreta nemorum". The P-type belongs morphologically to the variety "B. vulgaris" var. "arcuata", but may also be identical to the subspecies originally described as "Barbaraea" Beck "arcuata" Rchb. ssp. "pubescens" N. Busch. In this context, the usual type of "B. vulgaris" var. "arcuata" is called the "G-type" (for Glabrous (hairless) leaves).
A chemotype with deviating glucosinolate content has been described from W. Europe and named the "NAS-type" (because it is dominated by the glucosinolate glucoNASturtiin. This type has increased resistance to some specialized insects. In this context, the usual chemotype of "B. vulgaris" is called the "BAR" type (because it is dominated by glucoBARbarin).

Nagaradhane

Nagaradhane (Tulu:ನಾಗಾರಾಧನೆ) is a form of snake worship which, along with Bhuta Kola, is one of the unique traditions prevalent in coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod alternatively known as Tulu Nadu
Origin of Nagaradhane.
Snakes, especially the cobra have been revered from ancient times all over India. Due to their mysterious appearances and slithering movements, snakes had always been held in awe in India. Snakes find mention in famous religious epics like Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana etc. Hindu Gods like Vishnu and Shiva have been associated with snakes. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu takes rest under the shade of the giant snake, Adisesha. Lord Shiva wears a snake vasuki around his neck. 
It is difficult to trace the origin of Nagaradhane, though the Nairs of Kerala and Bunts of Tulu Nadu claim to be kshatriyas
of Nagavanshi descent, thus maybe snake worship was popularised by them. Though most rituals of snake worship are done by Brahmins, there is not a single Bunt house that does not have a nagabana. Mostly, snakes were seen as a symbol of fertility. Elsewhere in India, snakes are worshiped during the Nagarapanchami Day. They are offered milk (research has shown that snakes are allergic to milk) and thilak is applied on their forehead.
The snake worship rituals practiced in Tulu Nadu are quite unique and different from the other rituals. Snakes have their own snake shrines in a sacred grove known as Nagabana. The shrines have images of cobras carved of stones. Accordingly, nobody is allowed to chop the tree near the Nagabana. It is also believed that snakes, specifically the cobras, are not be harmed or killed by anyone. If harmed, the individual has to perform a ritual to cleanse the sin of killing or harming the snake. The belief is that the individual who refuses to perform the ritual will be cursed by the snake for eternity.
It can also be noted that in Tulu Nadu or the South Canara region in Karnataka, agriculture is predominant that too paddy is the main crop. In these fields snakes help in saving the crop from rodents. This can be a plausible reason for worship of snakes in line with other nature worships such as cow and the banyan tree.
The ritual.
There are two distinct rituals performed in reverence to the snake. They are, Aashleshabali and Nagamandala. Of these, Nagamandala is longer and colourful than Aashleshabali. 
Nagamandala depicts the divine union of male and female snakes. It is generally performed by two priests. The first priest, called as patri inhales the areca flower and becomes the male snake. The second priest, called as Nagakannika or the female snake dances and sings around an elaborate serpent design drawn with natural colours on the sacred ground. 
The ritual is supplemented by playing an hour glass shaped instrument called as Dakke. The drawings in five different colours on the sacred ground are white (white mud), red (mix of lime powder and turmeric powder), green (green leaves powder), yellow (turmeric powder) and black (roasted and powdered paddy husk). 
Aashleshabali is similar nature to the after death rituals performed for the humans as per the Hindu tradition.
The ritual, centered around the serpent design, continues till early in the morning. A similar kind of ritual is found in Kerala and is known as Sarpam Thullal and Sarpam Kali. All communities of Tulu Nadu revere snakes.
Significance of Nagabanas.
Nagabanas or the sacred groves are deemed to be the resting place of the Snake God. Cutting of trees or defacing the grove is considered as sacrilege. People are wary of the wrath unleashed by the deity. Nagabanas once remained unspoilt and have contributed immensely to the preservation of valuable trees and medicinal plants in Tulu Nadu, but not now. With rapid and unplanned urbanisation many nagabanas have disappeared and in their place small temples for serpent god have been built clearing valuable trees and plants.

SSI analysts have contributed to major U.S. national security strategy documents and to U.S. Army doctrine. The U.S. Army War College also hosts a major annual strategy conference at Carlisle Barracks.
PARAMETERS is a referred journal of ideas and issues, providing a forum for the expression of mature thought on the art and science of land warfare, joint and combined matters, national and international security affairs, military strategy, military leadership and management, military history, ethics, and other topics of significant and current interest to the US Army and Department of Defense. It serves as a vehicle for continuing the education and professional development of USAWC graduates and other senior military officials, as well as members of government and academia concerned with national security affairs.

<doc id="4876828" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4876828" title="Law of the wall">
Law of the wall

In fluid dynamics, the law of the wall states that the average velocity of a turbulent flow at a certain point is proportional to the logarithm of the distance from that point to the "wall", or the boundary of the fluid region. This law of the wall was first published by Theodore von Kármán, in 1930. It is only technically applicable to parts of the flow that are close to the wall (<20% of the height of the flow), though it is a good approximation for the entire velocity profile of natural streams.
General logarithmic formulation.
The logarithmic law of the wall is a self similar solution for the mean velocity parallel to the wall, and is valid for flows at high Reynolds numbers — in an overlap region with approximately constant shear stress and far enough from the wall for (direct) viscous effects to be negligible:
where 
From experiments, the Von Kármán constant is found to be "κ"≈0.41 and "C+"≈5.0 for a smooth wall.
With dimensions, the logarithmic law of the wall can be written as:
where "y0" is the distance from the boundary at which the idealized velocity given by the law of the wall goes to zero. This is necessarily nonzero because the turbulent velocity profile defined by the law of the wall does not apply to the laminar sublayer. The distance from the wall at which it reaches zero is determined by comparing the thickness of the laminar sublayer with the roughness of the surface over which it is flowing. For a near-wall laminar sublayer of thickness "δν" and a characteristic roughness length-scale "ks",
Intuitively, this means that if the roughness elements are hidden within the laminar sublayer, they have a much different effect on the turbulent law of the wall velocity profile than if they are sticking out into the main part of the flow.
This is also often more formally formulated in terms of a boundary Reynolds number, "Re""w", where
The flow is hydraulically smooth for "Re""w" <3, hydraulically rough for "Re""w" >100, and transitional for intermediate values.
Values for "y0" are given by:
Intermediate values are generally given by the empirically derived Nikuradse diagram, though analytical methods for solving for this range have also been proposed.
For channels with a granular boundary, such as natural river systems,
where "D84" is the average diameter of the 84th largest percentile of the grains of the bed material.
Power law solutions.
Work by Barenblatt and others has shown that besides the logarithmic law of the wall — the limit for infinite Reynolds numbers — there exist power-law solutions, which "are dependent" on the Reynolds number.
</ref> 
In 1996, Cipra submitted experimental evidence in support of these power-law descriptions. This evidence itself has not been fully accepted by other experts.
In 2001, Oberlack claimed to have derived both the logarithmic law of the wall, as well as power laws, directly from the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, exploiting the symmetries in a Lie group approach. All scaling laws derived in should represent the leading order solutions of a corresponding averaged Navier-Stokes boundary value problem for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, and hence should all be valid in spatial regimes where the influence of the boundaries can be ignored. This derivation from first principles however lacks mathematical rigor. It is based on several critical assumptions, mainly to justify the use of the pure temporal scaling symmetry of the inviscid Euler equations, a symmetry not admitted by the viscous Navier-Stokes equations, not even to leading order in any strict perturbative sense for small viscosities. The well-known challenging issues related to the vanishing viscosity limit in transiting from the viscous Navier-Stokes to the inviscid Euler equations, particularly for bounded flows, also resides in every Lie group analysis for variable transformations, in that the limit is singularly unstable for symmetry transformations and non-unique for equivalence transformations. These crucial issues were not addressed in the derivation, making this derivation from first principles thus highly questionable. The difference here between a symmetry and an equivalence transformation is that the former defines viscosity as an arbitrary but fixed parameter, while the latter contrarily defines viscosity as an own additional Lie group variable next to all coordinates and flow variables. Eventually an ultimate test for these scaling laws allegedly emerging from first principles would be to show if the proposed Lie group methodology allows for a consistent unified treatment in agreement with experiment or DNS data when higher-order statistical quantities are included, in particular when involving the quantity of dissipation with its anomalous behavior in the vanishing viscosity limit. Otherwise the assumptions made in order to derive these proposed wall scaling laws in distorts the conclusion of dealing with a rigorous derivation from first principles.
Near the wall.
Below the region where the law of the wall is applicable, there are other estimations for friction velocity.
Viscous sublayer.
In the region known as the viscous sublayer, below 5 wall units, the variation of "u+" to "y+" is approximately 1:1, such that:
where 
This approximation can be used farther than 5 wall units, but by "y+=12" the error is more than 25%.
Buffer layer.
In the buffer layer, between 5 wall units and 30 wall units, neither law holds, such that:
with the largest variation from either law occurring approximately where the two equations intercept, at "y+=11". That is, before 11 wall units the linear approximation is more accurate and after 11 wall units the logarithmic approximation should be used, though neither are relatively accurate at 11 wall units.
The mean streamwise velocity profile U+ is improved for y+ < 20 with an eddy viscosity formulation based on a near-wall turbulent kinetic energy k+ function and the van Driest mixing length equation. Comparisons with DNS data of fully developed turbulent channel flows for 109<Reτ<2003 showed good agreement.

56th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)

The British Army's 56th Infantry Brigade was originally a Kitchener's Army brigade within 19th (Western) Division during the First World War. Later during the Second World War it was reformed on 15 February 1944 in the United Kingdom. 
The Brigade took part in the Invasion of Normandy, where it formed the right flank of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on Gold Beach. It remained attached to the 50th Division until the 10th, after which it was attached to the 7th Armoured Division until 12 June, reverting then to 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. It came under command of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division in early August 1944. It was eventually permanently attached to the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division on 20 August 1944. 
56 Brigade took part in the Normandy landings, liberated Bayeux on 7 June leaving the town mainly intact. All its battalions were involved in the taking of Tilly-sur-Seulles with 2 Essex finally investing the town. Later actions were north of St Germain d'Ectot and the liberation of Thury-Harcourt in the Suisse Normande. It was prominent in the drive towards Le Havre and was one of the assault divisions taking the city in September 1944. Continuing to fight in Belgium at Poppel and then the Netherlands it was the assault brigade for the final assault on Arnhem in April 1945. The 56th served well, and ended the war in Germany.
The Brigade was reformed in January 1987 within London District and comprised mostly Guards Public duties battalions. It was seen as the successor of the London Divisions of the First and Second World Wars. It was disbanded in 1993.

Belvoir (theatre company)

Belvoir is an Australian theatre company based at the Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney, Australia. Its Artistic Director is Ralph Myers.
Belvoir receives government support for its activities from the federal government through the Major Performing Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts and the state government through Arts NSW.
History.
Belvoir was formed in 1984 and, originally under the artistic leadership of Neil Armfield, the company engages Australia's most prominent and promising playwrights, directors and actors. Belvoir also tours to major arts centres and festivals both nationally and internationally.
Belvoir sprang into being out of the unique action taken to save the Nimrod Theatre building from demolition in 1984. Rather than lose a performance space in inner city Sydney, more than 600 arts, entertainment and media professionals as well as ardent theatre lovers, formed a syndicate to buy the building. The syndicate included nearly every successful person in Australian show business.
Belvoir St Theatre's greatly loved Upstairs and Downstairs stages have been the artistic watering holes of many of Australia's great performing artists such as Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchett, Jacqueline McKenzie, Ursula Yovich, Richard Roxburgh, Max Cullen, Bille Brown, David Wenham, Tyler Coppin, Deborah Mailman and Catherine McClements.
Sell-out productions like "Cloudstreet", "The Judas Kiss", "The Alchemist", "Hamlet", "Waiting for Godot", "Gulpilil", "Stuff Happens", "Keating!", "Parramatta Girls", "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and Michael Gow's "Toy Symphony", have consolidated Belvoir's position as one of Australia's most innovative and acclaimed theatre companies.

<doc id="4876873" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4876873" title="Ballylumford power station">
Ballylumford power station

Ballylumford power station is a natural gas-fired power station in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK. With its main plant generating 600 megawatts of electricity, it is Northern Ireland's largest power station and provides half of the province's power. Overall the station produces 1316MW. The plant is located at the tip of the Islandmagee peninsula, which separates Larne Lough from the Irish Sea. The lough is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. 
The 3 chimneys of the power station are 126 metres tall. East of the station is the static inverter plant of HVDC Moyle, a power cable connecting the system to Great Britain.
History.
The first power station built at the site was started in 1943. The "A" station was powered by coal and operated until 1974, when the "B" station was completed. 
The station was a key factor in the 1974 Ulster Workers' Council strike. Supplying all of Belfast and most of the eastern half of the country, Northern Ireland was effectively brought to a standstill when the mainly Protestant workers of the plant were persuaded to join the strike. The closure of the plant together with the wider strike resulted in the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement. 
In 1991 the nationalised power company, Northern Ireland Electricity, was incorporated as a government owned public limited company. In 1992 the four power stations at Belfast Harbour, Ballylumford, Derry (Coolkeeragh) and Carrickfergus (Kilroot) were demerged and sold. In 1993 the remainder of NIE (transmission, supply and retail businesses) was privatised as Northern Ireland Electricity plc.
In 1992 the supply of electricity in Northern Ireland was privatised. As a result Northern Ireland Electricity sold the Ballylumford site to its present owners, Premier Power Ltd, a subsidiary of British Gas. A condition of the sale was that the plant must be converted from heavy oil to gas-fired. British Gas formed Premier Transco Ltd. to build a submarine interconnector, the Scotland-Northern Ireland Pipeline (SNIP), a 135 km pipe (40.4 km under sea) with a diameter of 0.61 m. Construction lasted three years (1994-1996) and was completed on time and on budget. Ballylumford converted to natural gas in 1996. To take advantage of this investment a licence was tendered to provide natural gas to Belfast, a tender which British Gas won through its subsidiary Phoenix Natural Gas.
In 2000 work began on the site's newest facility, a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), which has greatly increased efficiency and reduced pollution. 
The new power block, called "C" Station entered into commercial operation in 2003 and comprises steam turbines and gas turbines that can operate both in open cycle and in combined cycle.
The gas turbines burn natural gas as the primary fuel but can also operate on low sulphur distillate liquid fuel if the gas fuel supply is interrupted.
The electricity is generated at 15 and 18kV medium voltage and is increased to a higher 275/110kV level by step-up transformers to match the Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) transmission system requirements. This high-voltage electricity is transferred by underground cables to existing outgoing feeder connections in an adjacent NIE switch house and then through the transmission system to the electricity users.
In 2010 the American-owned AES Corporation entered into an agreement with BG Energy Holdings to acquire Premier Power Ltd. for £99m and are the power station's current owners.
Acquisition by AES Corporation.
On 12 August 2010 the AES Corporation announced that its subsidiary, AES Ballylumford Holdings Limited, had acquired Premier Power Limited (PPL) through an all cash transaction for £102 million (approximately $160 million), which included purchase price and working capital adjustment. The transaction was announced on 2 July 2010, and was subject to licence consents from the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.

Santa Maria della Pace

Santa Maria della Pace is a church in Rome, central Italy, not far from Piazza Navona. 
History.
The current building was built on the foundations of the pre-existing church of Sant'Andrea de Aquarizariis in 1482, commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV. The church was rededicated to the Virgin Mary to remember a miraculous bleeding of a Madonna image there in 1480. The author of the original design is not known, though Baccio Pontelli has been proposed. 
In 1656–67 Pope Alexander VII had the edifice restored by Pietro da Cortona, who also added the famous Baroque façade projecting from its concave wings: this, devised to simulate a theatrical set, has two orders and is entered by a semi-circular pronaos with paired Doric columns. The church presses forward almost to fill its tiny piazza; several houses had to be demolished by Pietro da Cortona to create even this miniature trapezoidal space. This newly formed piazza, focussed on the church facade even in its architectural detailing, had the additional benefits of facilitating the turning of coaches which had become so fashionable with the Roman nobility of the time and creating an ingenious unified ensemble of the church in its urban setting. The play of concave and convex forms at varying scales in and around the predominant main facade masks the neighbouring buildings, extends the apparent breadth of the facade and so increases the visual impact on the spectator physically confined by the small trapezoidal piazza. The monumental effect of the plasticity of forms, spatial layering and chiarascuro lighting effects belies the actual scale of this urban intervention. 
The inscription around the porch architrave is taken from Psalm 72: SUSCIPIANT MONTES PACEM POPULO ET COLLES IUSTITIAM ("The mountains shall bring peace to the people; and the hills, justice"). This reference to the 'mountains' of the coat of arms of the Chigi family, to which Alexander VII belonged, is presumably an allusion to the benefits of his papal reign. Oak leaf motifs, another Chigi family emblem, can also be found on the facade. On the upper facade, Cortona had the curved travertine panels cut to make grained matching patterns, in an unusual use of this particular material. Through the tall central window, the circular window of the Quattrocento church facade is visible.
Interior.
The interior, which can be reached from the original fifteenth-century door, has a short nave with cruciform vaulting and a tribune surmounted by a cupola. Cortona articulated the interior of the dome with octagonal coffering and a series of ribs radiating from the lantern. This is an early example of combining these two forms of dome decoration and was employed by Gianlorenzo Bernini in his later churches at Ariccia and Castelgandolfo.
Carlo Maderno designed the high altar (1614) to enframe the venerable icon of the "Madonna and Child".
Chigi Chapel.
Raphael began to fresco the "Four Sibyls receiving angelic instruction" (1514) above the arch of the Chigi Chapel, commissioned by Agostino Chigi, the papal banker. The "Deposition" over the altar is by Cosimo Fancelli.
Cesi and Ponzetti Chapels.
The second chapel on the right, the Cesi Chapel, was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, and has a very fine Renaissance decoration on the external arch by Simone Mosca, as well as two small frescoes, the "Creation of Eve" and the "Original Sin" by Rosso Fiorentino.
The first chapel on the left (Ponzetti Chapel) has noteworthy Renaissance frescoes by Baldassarre Peruzzi, who is better known as an architect. The second chapel has marble taken from the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.
The tribune has paintings by Carlo Maratta, Peruzzi, Orazio Gentileschi, Francesco Albani and others.
A main feature of the church and monastery complex is the Bramante cloister. Built in 1500-1504 for Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, it was the first work of Donato Bramante in the city. It has two levels: the first is articulated by shallow pilasters set against an arcade; the second also has pilasters set against an arcade which is vertically continuous with the lower storey, but with columns located in between each arch span.

United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies

The United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies is a Congressional subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Appropriations. 
The United States House Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United State Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Appropriations process.
Traditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings. This is called "302(b) allocations" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions. However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one. The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.
Appropriations bills.
An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The "fiscal year" is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. 
There are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills. Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief. 
Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.

Remote Luxury (album)

In 1984, the Church signed to Warner Bros. in the United States, which was interested in releasing the band's most recent material. Rather than simply put out the "Persia" and "Remote Luxury" EPs, the label decided to repackage them as one album. Along with reshuffling the tracks to give them some semblance of cohesiveness, Warner Bros. decided to release "Constant In Opal" as a U.S. single. The version of "No Explanation" has a 20-second instrumental jam tagged on to the front of it, apparently recorded separately from the original.

O. V. Wright

Overton Vertis "O. V." Wright (October 9, 1939 – November 16, 1980) was an American singer who is generally regarded as a blues artist by African American fans in the Deep South; he is also regarded as one of Southern soul's most authoritative and individual artists. His best known songs include "That's How Strong My Love Is" (1964), "You're Gonna Make Me Cry" (1965), "Nucleus of Soul" (1968), "A Nickel and a Nail" (1971), "I Can't Take It" (1971) and "Ace of Spades" (1971).
Biography.
Born in Leno, Tennessee, Wright, as a youngster, began singing in the church. In 1956, while still in high school, he joined The Sunset Travelers as one of the lead singers for the gospel group. He later fronted a gospel music group, the Harmony Echoes. It was during this time that he was discovered (along with James Carr) by Roosevelt Jamison a songwriter and manager. Their first pop recording in 1964 was "That's How Strong My Love Is," a ballad later covered by Otis Redding and the Rolling Stones. It was issued on Goldwax, the label Wright signed to after leaving his gospel career. It was later determined that Don Robey still had him under a recording contract, due to his gospel group having recorded for Peacock. After his contract was shifted to Don Robey’s Back Beat label, further R&B hits followed. Working with record producer Willie Mitchell, success continued on songs including "Ace of Spades" and "A Nickel and a Nail".
Wright's hits were much more popular in the deep South. His biggest hits were "You're Gonna Make Me Cry" (R&B #6, 1965), "Eight Men, Four Women" (R&B #4, 1967) "Ace of Spades" (R&B #11, 1970), "A Nickel and a Nail" (R&B #19, 1971). The remainder of his 17 hits charted no higher than #20 on the R&B charts.
However, Wright was imprisoned for narcotics offenses during the mid-1970s, and, despite signing for Hi Records and releasing a series of recordings, his commercial success failed to recover after his release. A continuing drug problem weakened his health and he died from a heart attack, in Mobile, Alabama at age 41.
Legacy.
Wright is among the most remembered voices of soul music, perhaps mostly for being sampled frequently in hip hop music. In 1996, his song, "Motherless Child" was sampled on the Ghostface Killah album "Ironman" on a song also called "Motherless Child." It and another Wright recording, "Let's Straighten It Out" have been published on Shaolin Soul, a compilation of tracks that have been sampled by the Wu Tang Clan and its members. "Let's Straighten It Out" was sampled in a Wu-Tang Clan song called "America" from the charity compilation album "America Is Dying Slowly". "Ace of Spades" was sampled by Slim Thug and the Boss Hogg Outlawz on a song named "Recognize A Playa".
Wright has been a big influence on many Soul and Blues singers including Robert Cray, Otis Clay, Taj Mahal as well as young Soul singer Reggie Sears among many others.
Johnny Rawls joined Wright's backing band in the mid-1970s, and played together with Wright until the latter's death in 1980. The band then continued billed as the O.V. Wright Band for another 13 years, and toured and performed with other musicians over this time span. These included B.B. King, Little Milton, Bobby Bland, Little Johnny Taylor, and Blues Boy Willie.

Harpegnathos saltator

Harpegnathos saltator, sometimes called Jerdon's jumping ant, is a species of ant found in India. They have long mandibles and have the ability to leap a few inches. They are large eyed and are active predators that hunt mainly in the early morning hours. The colonies are small and the difference between workers and queens is very slight.
Habits.
Unlike other ants, they are seen singly or in small groups and their colonies consist of very small numbers of individuals. They are also unusual amongst ants in that the queen-worker difference is very limited and some workers can mate and lay fertilized eggs just like the queen. These workers are termed gamergates. New colonies are founded independently by single queens, and on aging they are replaced by several gamergates. The gamergates copulate with males from their own colonies and, being inbred, are related to the original founding queen. Colonies are very small, and they never undergo fission to form new colonies. 
The workers control the number of reproductives in the colony, and will kill some of the gamergates (as shown in the taxobox image). Workers use alarm pheromones which include 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol and isopentyl isopentanoate. "H. saltator", like many species of ant, produces 4-methyl-3-heptanone from mandibular glands. Dufour's gland secretions have been found to include a complex mixture of linear hydrocarbons from C15 to C25, with ("Z")-9-tricosene being the main constituent, along with other minor constituents like tetradecyl propionate and traces of tetradecyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. Both the secretions from the postpharyngeal glands and the cuticular wax include methyl esters of common fatty acids.
Their leaps are accomplished by synchronized abduction of the middle and hind pairs of legs. They can jump up to 2 cm high and 10 cm long. These leaps are made not only to escape, but also to catch flying prey. The workers forage only during the cool hours of the morning and afternoon with a lull in activity during mid day.
The nest entrance is usually a low mound on the ground with the entrance surrounded by twigs and leaves. The nest entrance is closed by the ants in the evening, and is reopened in the day. The main chamber has a funnel-like opening in the antechamber, and this structure is believed to prevent flooding of the main chamber.
A study of the genome and expressed genes found that the production of enzymes that slow aging (telomerase and sirtuin deacetylases) are increased when workers turn into queens.

Chelmsford Royal Commission

The Chelmsford Royal Commission (1988–1990), chaired by Justice John Patrick Slattery, was established by the New South Wales state government to investigate "Mental Health Services" in NSW. It came about only after prominent Sydney radio and TV shows pressured the newly elected Health Minister, Peter Collins, to make good his promises for a Royal Commission. Originally its prime focus was to have been psychosurgery at the NSW Neuropsychiatric Institute. Following media pressure it focused more on the "Deep sleep therapy" of Dr Harry Bailey, who was director from 1963 to 1979 of the Neuropsychiatric Institute and later the Chelmsford Private Hospital, a private psychiatric institution in Sydney. 
Such was the shift of public attention that the Royal Commission changed its title from "Royal Commission into Mental Health Services" to "Royal Commission into Deep Sleep Therapy" (DST). The Royal Commission found that 24 patients died as a result of "deep sleep therapy".
DST was Bailey's invention, a cocktail of barbiturates to put patients into a coma lasting up to 39 days, while also administering electro-convulsive therapy (ECT). Bailey likened the treatment to switching off a television; his self-developed theory was that the brain, by shutting down for an extended period, would "unlearn" habits that led to depression, addiction and other psychiatric conditions. Bailey claimed to have learnt DST from psychiatrists in Britain and Europe, though it was later found that only a mild variant was used there, sedating traumatised ex-soldiers for a few hours at a time, not the median 14 days under which Bailey and his colleague Dr John Herron subjected their 1127 DST patients at Chelmsford between 1963 and 1979.
Bailey sought to get evidence in his defence from prominent Melbourne Psychiatrist Alex Sinclair (deceased), which revealed that Sinclair had used deep sedation therapy (apparently without the ECT). Dr. Sinclair said in a subsequent newspaper interview that he had given the treatment to prominent people including judges and politicians. The Victorian Coroner found that Sinclair had contributed to the death of a patient given deep sedation therapy in 1987.
A Victorian private psychiatric hospital which was associated with a quasi religious sect, Newhaven, "specialised in the use of LSD and psilocybin (magic mushrooms), Deep Sleep Therapy and ECT." 
Bailey committed suicide in September 1985, in response to the ongoing investigations into his practices. In his suicide note, he said: "Let it be known that the Scientologists and the forces of madness have won".

<doc id="4877010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877010" title="Ishar">
Ishar

Ishar is a series of three role-playing computer games by Silmarils for the PC, Amiga, Atari and Macintosh platforms. They are preceded by "Crystals of Arborea", which is sometimes nicknamed "Ishar 0".
Each of these games, except for "Crystals of Arborea", has a first-person display, and allows the player to direct a group of five characters, each one having a different race and character classes that give him various abilities.
"Crystals of Arborea".
"Crystals of Arborea" was published by Silmarils in 1991. It precedes "Ishar" both chronologically and by its gameplay. Morgoth, the main antagonist of "Crystals of Arborea", is the father of Krogh, the one of "Ishar: Legend of the Fortress". Moreover, most of the heroes of the game, Jarel's companions, can be met in "Ishar" or even in "Ishar 2".
"Ishar: Legend of the Fortress".
The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, "Ishar", whose name means "unknown" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.
Most of "Ishar" takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.
This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved.
The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.
"Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom".
"Ishar 2" was published in 1993 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. In "Ishar 2", the player starts with the character of Zubaran, who is the new lord of Ishar. He receives a vision that tells him to defeat the sorcerer Shandar. It is also possible to import a party of characters from the first "Ishar". The game now takes place on an archipelago, each island bearing the name of one of Jarel's companions. Each island also features a different type of landscape: Irvan's island is covered with swamps, Akeer's and Otbar's are underground complexes, Zach's island is covered by a city, Jon's is mountainous, and Thorm's has treetop gangways in a forest.
This game has a combat system that's more ergonomic than in the first Ishar, and a day-night cycle in which shops are closed at night and the nightclub is closed by day. It also adds a bank (let's leave it to players to figure out what to do with it). Saving the game does not remove gold from the player any more.
"Ishar 3: Seven Gates of Infinity".
"Ishar 3" was published in 1994. The player starts with Zubaran or imports characters from another game of the series, and has to hunt the dragon of Sith. In order to do that, he needs to cross a series of gates, each one sending him to a different time period. Each period, like the islands of "Ishar 2", has its own climate and type of landscape.

United States House Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department

The United States House Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department is a defunct a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives.
History.
Initially, the House appointed special committees to monitor the use of public moneys. In 1802, the Committee of Ways and Means was empowered to review expenditures and to report such provisions and arrangements "as may be necessary to add to the economy of the departments, and the accountability of their officers." On February 26, 1814, Congress divided the duties of the Committee of Ways and Means and transferred that part relating to the examination of past expenditures to a standing Committee on Public Expenditures. 
In 1816, the House initiated an organizational change that provided a means of continuously and consistently following the operations of the various Departments in the Executive branch and scrutinizing their expenditures. On February 28, 1816, Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia proposed the appointment of six standing committees to examine the accounts and expenditures of the State, Treasury, War, Navy, Post Office Departments and those related to the construction and maintenance of public buildings.
The committees were created on March 30, 1816, with Stevenson Archer (Maryland), Wilson Lumpkin (Georgia), and Benjamin Huger (South Carolina) as the first members of the Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department. 
In 1927 it was consolidate with ten other Committees on Expenditures to form the United States House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. The functions of the committee are now part of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

Persephone (instrument)

The Persephone is an analog fingerboard synthesizer from the year 2004 in the tradition of the first ribbon controlled instruments from the 1920s. Beyond its vintage look, the Persephone allies sensors technology and digital controls to a pure analogue generation of sound.
With its analogue oscillator, the Persephone can generate notes with a range of 10 octaves, which goes from a deep and resonant cello tone to a nearly human voice. And on the highest pitches, it can reach very high frequencies. Its ribbon virtual control surface allows all kind of glissando a Theremin or an Ondes Martenot would allow. The Persephone's ribbon can be scaled from 1, 2, 5 to 10 octaves. The ribbon responds to changes in voltage or resistance caused by changing the finger position along its surface. The Persephone ribbon controller is also able to record pressure or velocity.
The ribbon is a linear potentiometer that generates different control voltages depending on where it is touched. Thus, the modern ribbon on the Persephone replaces the nickel-chrome resistance wire used as a variable resistor to control the pitch of the trautonium1. These changes in voltage are applied to the voltage-controlled oscillator and the filter. The voltage fluctuations are also translated into binary data and used to control digital modulation. With MIDI in/out and CV, it can also be used as a MIDI controller.

Horibe Yasubei

In 1694, Yasubei came to the aid of his dojo mate and pledged uncle in a duel at Takadanobaba in Edo, killing three opponents. He received acclaim for his role, and Horibe Yahei of the Akō Domain asked Yasubei to marry his daughter and become the heir to Yahei's family. Yahei was so impressed with Yasubei that he pleaded to his liege, Asano Naganori, to allow Yasubei to keep his Nakayama surname while marrying into the Horibe family. Yasubei eventually took on the Horibe surname and became a successful retainer of the Akō Domain.
In 1701, Asano Naganori was sentenced to commit "seppuku" as a result of an attack on Kira Yoshinaka. The Akō Domain was disbanded, and Yasubei once again became a ronin. In 1702, Yasubei and Yahei were among the Forty-seven Ronin who attacked and killed Kira, avenging their late lord's death. Yasubei surrendered to the authorities and was placed in the custody of Matsudaira Oki no Kami Sadanao. On March 20, 1703 (according to the Gregorian calendar), he was sentenced to commit seppuku.
Horibe Yasubei has a prominent role in plays, films, and television depictions of "Chūshingura", the fictionalized account of the Forty-seven Ronin.

He can operate in central midfield as well on the left wing. He was traded to Chunnam for the services of Kim Nam-Il who went to Suwon in exchange, but did not renew the contract. He is not a free agent under the regulations. He had no choice but to play for any other team but Chunnam.
In September 2006, he has stated that he has managed to shed over 20 lbs weighing 78 kg whereas he weighed about 76 kg during his heyday. In spite of renewed hopes of his much anticipated return, the latest Ko sighting was in December 2006. Ko was reportedly not in football shape and evaded reporter questions by driving off in a white Mercedes Benz. (But Ko denied this claim, saying: "After hearing that news, once I thought to give up the life of footballer.") On 8 January 2007, Daejeon Citizen signed Ko one year after Chunnam Dragons agreed on his transfer. His wage will be decided based on how well he performs in winter training camp in Cyprus. Ko expressed a strong desire to return to the sport, telling an interviewer: "I will play for Daejeon regarding this chance as the last."

The United Nations Commission on Conventional Armaments was founded as a result of the founding United Nations treaty in 1946. The goal of the commission was to find ways to reduce the size of non-nuclear armaments around the world. The Commission was formally established by the Security Council on 15 February 1947. The five permanent members of the United Nation Security Council could not agree on how to achieve this aim and so the first report of the Commission in 1949 made no substantial recommendations.
In 1950, the Soviet Union refused to sit with the representatives of the "Kuomintang group" (i.e. the non-communist Chinese representatives) on the Commission. This brought an effective end to the Commission's discussion. It was formally dissolved in 1952.

We'd reached this new energy level on stage which by far superseded anything we'd ever recorded, so we knew the only way to get sounding like that (on record) was for the whole band to write together." 
Robert Dean Lurie notes that "As the band began cutting the album at Studio 301, it became apparent that there had been a dramatic change in Steve's voice.Perhaps it was the extended break from performing, or abstaining from drugs, or the hours of yoga; in any case, Steve's singing was now much more relaxed and warm, and he possessed a wider, more dynamic range. For years, critics had pointed to Steve's sometimes dour voice as the Church's weak point. Suddenly, during these new recording sessions, his distinctive vocals became one of the band's greatest strengths -- its signature, in fact. In addition to singing all the leads, Steve also tracked multiple harmony parts for each song, sometimes singing an entire octave higher than his normal register." 
Although most of the keyboards utilized on previous recordings had been stripped back, the album saw a greater amount of embellishment with the addition of strings and brass. While at the time "Heyday" featured more focus on the guitar interplay than anything since "The Blurred Crusade", solos had been cut to a bare minimum. Rolling Stone said the album "suggesta more electrified version of Love's '68 orchestral rock classic Forever Changes."[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thechurch/albums/album/289934/review/5946347/heyday
Despite some critics and followers taking issue with the brash horns on some songs, the album regularly lists among the fanbase's (and even band members') favorites. Tracks such as "Myrrh" and "Tantalized" have been featured in live shows even up to present day. It is notable for being, to date, the last Church album to feature a printed lyric sheet - Kilbey has declined to include lyrics with any subsequent Church albums.
Despite the increased amount of studio collaboration on "Heyday" between the members, while the band was on tour in April 1986 to support the album, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions. On 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany; Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts.

Tramlink route 1

Tramlink route 1 is one of four tram routes operated as part of the Tramlink network in south London. The route is operated by London Tramlink, part of Transport for London (TfL).
History.
Like many modern tram systems, most of the length of Tramlink route 1 on the Tramlink is built on disused railway alignments. British Rail, and their successors Connex South Central and Connex South Eastern, had run two un-profitable shuttle services along branch lines, one being a remnant of the Mid-Kent Line between Elmers End and Addiscombe, calling at Woodside operated by Connex South Eastern and the other being a service between West Croydon and Wimbledon on the former Surrey Iron Railway alignment, operated by Connex South Central. Both services ceased in the summer 1997 timetable to allow Tramlink construction to take place, and in the event were re-opened after almost exactly three years, with a much more frequent tram service.
In 1839 the London and Croydon Railway was opened, running to what is now West Croydon, and branching off from the London and Greenwich Railway near Bermondsey. In 1841 the London and Brighton Railway, constructed a line branching off in Croydon, and becoming the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1846. Branching off this in turn, at Redhill, was the Redhill to Tonbridge Line, from 1844. 
Mid Kent Railway.
The North Kent Railway, was built in 1849. This was originally planned as an extension of the L&G, but this would have meant tunnelling under the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and worries about vibrations from passing trains affecting observations led to it being diverted in a generous curve via Lewisham and Blackheath, to rejoin the intended route from Charlton and Woolwich onwards (although the original route via Maze Hill was subsequently built). To complement it, the Mid Kent Railway was conceived, branching off at Lewisham by a sharp curve and initially heading southwards, intended then to curve gradually east to the middle of Kent. 
However, construction was overtaken by events, namely the more direct South Eastern Main Line via Grove Park, Orpington and Sevenoaks, which later became the South Eastern Railway. Thus construction of the MKR in its original form was abandoned at New Beckenham, and a sharp kink to the west was introduced to take trains to a revised terminus at Addiscombe, near Croydon. This opened in 1864, and branches at Elmers End (to Hayes) and Woodside (to connect with the Oxted Line at Sanderstead, opening in 1885) were added. The branch from Woodside to Sanderstead was relatively unsuccessful and was finally closed by British Rail on 13 May 1983. The branch to Hayes became the main route, with the service between Elmers End and Addiscombe reduced to a shuttle service (although with some through services at peak hours).
Conversion to tram operation.
The route between Elmers End and Woodside has been converted to tram operation, although the section from Woodside to Addiscombe had been abandoned. The track had to be lowered at this point to fit the overhead wires safely under the bridge at Woodside; elsewhere, former Railtrack lines have been kept where possible, and the superior ride quality of the older track is noticeable. 
Instead of running into the old Addiscombe station — which has been demolished, with housing being built on the former station site — trams follow the Sanderstead branch alignment as far as Addiscombe Road. While the old branch skirted around Croydon, the obvious major traffic objective in the area, Tramlink was able to make good use of this alignment by running trams up onto the Addiscombe Road in order to serve Croydon town centre. This provides the only section of Line 1 that is not on former railway lines. In addition, extra stops were added at Arena and Blackhorse Lane. Addiscombe tram stop replaces Bingham Road Halt original station is was across Bingham Road from where Addiscombe tram stop is now. The tram stop is at road level, Bingham Road Halt Station was on an embankment and crossed the roads over bridges. It is still on the route of the Woodside and South Croydon Railway (locally known as the Sanderstead branch).
West Croydon to Wimbledon.
The other half of the route took over the former West Croydon to Wimbledon shuttle. Parts of the alignment between Waddon Marsh and Mitcham follow the Surrey Iron Railway which opened in 1803 between Wandsworth and Croydon. In more recent times this was a public service between West Croydon and Wimbledon, diverting off the original route at the ends, and latterly the service had run with a single train, giving an interval of approximately 45 minute between services. The line was closed by Railtrack on 31 May 1997, and, since there were no parallel bus services, temporary route TL1 was introduced, running half hourly and serving all the former stations. Initially operated by Cowie South London and later transferred to Metrobus, the route was never a success, carrying an average load of about 3.
Since Tramlink has taken over, a 10 minute service is provided during the day on Mondays to Saturdays and has proved unexpectedly popular. It provides a better public transport link to the previously under-served Purley Way retail area. Previously there was just the rail service, calling just at Waddon Marsh, or bus route 289, running into Croydon via a circuitous route via Thornton Road. Coincidentally, it is also the 289 that parallels Line 1 between central Croydon and Elmers End, so it is surprising that it was unaffected by London Transport's drastic bus cutbacks. 
In 2006 Route 1 was cut back to serve the loop rather than Wimbledon and Route 3 took over services to Wimbledon.
Capacity.
Route 1 runs from the West Croydon to Elmer's End, although Route 3 services used to run to West Croydon and Route 1 to Wimbledon. The Line runs parallel to Route 2 for the entire way apart from between Arena and Elmer's End. For the entire route, bus 289 runs totally next to it. A long term plan is to build a proper twin track terminus at Elmers End, which would allow a more robust timetable to be introduced. Nevertheless there has been some fine tuning of the timetable to minimise disruption, including services to Wimbledon being switched over to Route 3.
Current Route.
Change in Route Colours.
Since Transport for London took over operation and ownership, a new network map was put in place, changing routes 1 and 2 to lime and showing them as one route, but trams still show on route displays three routes, as trams from Elmers End change numbers in central Croydon to route 2 - Beckenham Junction and do the same when coming from Beckenham Junction. 
Route is listed from west to east. The following stops are served by all trams:

Torchwood Institute

The Torchwood Institute (usually referred to simply as Torchwood) is a fictional secret organization from the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who" and its spin-off series "Torchwood". It was established in 1879 by Queen Victoria after the events of "Tooth and Claw". Its prime directive is to defend Earth against supernatural and extraterrestrial threats. It is later revealed in "Army of Ghosts" that the Torchwood Institute has begun to use their findings to restore the British Empire to its former glory. To those ends, the organization started to acquire and reverse engineer alien technology. Within Torchwood an unofficial slogan evolved: "If it's alien, it's ours". According to one base director, Yvonne Hartman, its nationalist attitude includes refusing to use metric units.
While described as "beyond the UN", the Torchwood Institute is seen to cooperate with UNIT (the Unified Intelligence Taskforce, formerly known as the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce) to some extent. There appears to have been some rapport with the Prime Minister, although it is noted by Harriet Jones in "The Christmas Invasion" that she is not meant to know of Torchwood. Those who have come in contact with Torchwood primarily believe it to be a special forces team. They appear to maintain this illusion by using false witnesses, or by sectioning any journalists who threaten to expose the truth, and via the use of memory-altering drugs. Following a major incident which led to the destruction of Torchwood One, Jack Harkness rebuilds Torchwood to become less confrontational and more secretive in honour of the Doctor.
Conception.
The term "Torchwood", an anagram of "Doctor Who", was used as the codename for the new 2005 series of "Doctor Who" while filming its first few episodes and on the 'rushes' tapes to ensure that they would not be intercepted. At the end of the first series, Russell T Davies confirmed that the arc word for Series 2 would be an anagram which had been used before (the "Old Earth Torchwood Institute" had been mentioned in the episode "Bad Wolf").
The Torchwood arc ran the length of the second series, either mentioned just in passing ("Rise of the Cybermen", "The Idiot's Lantern", "Fear Her", "Love & Monsters"), or providing backstory about the Institute: its inception in 1879 ("Tooth and Claw"), its access to alien technology ("The Christmas Invasion"), and an expedition to a planet orbiting a black hole ("The Impossible Planet"/"The Satan Pit"), until the first contemporary appearance in "Army of Ghosts"/"Doomsday". Following the conclusion of the Torchwood arc, ancillary media and the "Torchwood" spin-off itself would contribute towards defining and expanding upon the Institute's fictional history.
Fictional history.
1879–2006.
The Institute was founded by Queen Victoria in 1879, following the events of the "Doctor Who" episode "Tooth and Claw". While staying at Torchwood House, the Scottish estate of Sir Robert MacLeish, the Queen (Pauline Collins) was attacked by a werewolf, in reality an alien intelligence that planned to infect her with its consciousness by biting her. The werewolf was ultimately dispatched, thanks to the efforts of the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and the sacrifice of Sir Robert.
Having discovered that "Great Britain had enemies beyond imagination," Victoria decided to establish the Torchwood Institute in memory of Sir Robert (who lived on the Torchwood Estate). She also decided that the Doctor was dangerous, and declared that if he ever returned, Torchwood would be waiting. The Doctor's name was written into the Torchwood Foundation's charter as an enemy of the Crown. Her Majesty also states in the Torchwood Charter 31 December 1879 that "Torchwood is also to administer to the Government thereof in our name, and generally to act in our name and on our behalf, subject to such orders and regulations as Torchwood shall, from time to time, receive from us through one of our Principal Secretaries of State". In 1882, Victoria expanded Torchwood's role to include the acquisition of alien technology, creating the policy that "if it's alien, it's ours". In 1888, Victoria reiterated the secrecy policy of the Torchwood Institute, protecting her subjects from the "evils that fight[s". Not long after the foundation of the Institute, a spacetime rift was identified in Cardiff and as a result, a smaller branch of the Institute (Torchwood Three) was formed there to monitor and exploit the Rift.
As shown in the episode "Fragments", Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) came to the attention of Torchwood Three in 1899, due to visiting the rift and talking about the Doctor. He was forced into working for the organization. Captured by two female Torchwood agents—Alice Guppy (Amy Manson) and Emily Holroyd (Heather Craney), Jack was subjected to torture and interrogation regarding the Doctor before being put to work for the Institute as a freelance agent for over a century. A few years later (1901), whilst this Harkness was in Torchwood's employ, Guppy and Charles Gaskell (Cornelius Macarthy) found and disinterred another Harkness on a different timeline, who instructs them to immediately "cryofreeze" and store him for 107 years to avoid him meeting his other self – they comply with his request.
The activities of the Torchwood Institute during the 20th century have, for the most part, yet to be revealed. It is known that the organization "flourished down the decades, becoming stronger" and grew "more arrogant." Some insights into the World War I-era organization (such as their progressive policies regarding women's civil rights) were offered in "Torchwood" episode "To the Last Man". Torchwood Three's progressive stance is also shown in the episode "Exit Wounds", where a black Torchwood member (possibly leader) called Charles Gaskell is shown in 1901, an era of widespread racial prejudice.
Other events in the 20th century have attributable dates. At the time of the British Raj, Torchwood also maintained a branch in Delhi. This was shut down in 1924, Torchwood anticipating Indian independence; agent Jack Harkness was sent to recover all their artifacts. In 1965, agent Jack Harkness was elected on behalf of the Institute (along with representatives of different government agencies) to facilitate the sacrifice of twelve children to aliens known as the 456 to save the planet at large. In 1983, Torchwood became the sole proprietor of H. C. Clements, a security firm. Torchwood One owned a holding facility which was then abandoned in 1995.
In 1996 a "Jathaa sunglider" flew into British airspace and was shot down by Torchwood. From its remains, an energy weapon was installed in London and later onto the UNIT aircraft carrier "Valiant". On New Year's Eve 1999, the then-leader of Torchwood Three (named "Alex Hopkins" by the Torchwood website) killed all the staff apart from Jack, ending with himself. He claimed that he was "saving" them, as the 21st century was when it all changed and humanity was not ready. Left in charge of Torchwood Three, Jack began severing the links with Torchwood One and their more aggressive policy on extraterrestrial life. Over the next few years, Jack recruited his own team; Suzie Costello (Indira Varma), Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Dr. Owen Harper (Burn Gorman).
By 2006, the existence of Torchwood was apparently a secret known only to the British military and police. Torchwood's activities during the time the Third Doctor was exiled to earth (during either the 1970s or 1980s depending upon one's point of view) have yet to be revealed. Knowledge of Torchwood was supposedly kept even from Prime Minister Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) and the UN. However, Jones did know about its existence anyway, and ordered Major Richard Blake (Chu Omambala) of UNIT to prepare Torchwood for the impending arrival of the Sycorax on Christmas Day. On the command of Prime Minister Harriet Jones, Torchwood used the Jathaa sunglider weapon to destroy a Sycorax ship on Christmas Day 2006.
2007–2012.
The Doctor discovered the existence of Torchwood in the 2006 series' two-part finale, "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" set in 2007. At this time, Torchwood operated software which blocked access to Internet searches about UFO activity ("School Reunion"). The TARDISODE for "Army of Ghosts" showed Torchwood agents abducting a journalist who was investigating the Institute and arranging to admit him to a psychiatric institution.
While investigating the manifestation of "ghosts" on Earth, the Doctor traced their origin back to Torchwood Tower, known publicly as One Canada Square, where Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) placed the Doctor in custody and confiscated the TARDIS. To Torchwood, the Doctor was a source of vast information and familiarity with alien technology which they could exploit to further the organization's aims.
Torchwood Tower had been built to reach a spatial breach 660 feet above sea level. Unbeknownst to Torchwood, the breach had been caused by the entrance into the universe of a "void ship", a vessel designed to travel through the void between parallel universes. Torchwood had been conducting experiments on the breach, in an attempt to harness its energy and reduce Britain's reliance on Middle Eastern oil, but these experiments had caused the breach to widen. The "ghosts" turned out to be Cybermen from an alternate universe, which were using the widening breach to travel between universes. A small advance force of Cybermen infiltrated Torchwood, "upgrading" or subverting Torchwood personnel, before eventually seizing control and opening the breach wide enough for ghost-like creatures around the world to manifest fully as millions of Cybermen.
However, the void ship had nothing to do with the Cybermen, and had in fact been created by the Daleks (voiced by Nicholas Briggs), four of whom had used it to escape the Time War. Caught between warring Daleks and Cybermen, many Torchwood workers were either killed, or "upgraded" in the Cybermen (including Hartman herself—although she retained some semblance of her identity). It is known that in the wake of these events, referred to as the "Battle of Canary Wharf", the Institute feels it must "learn by heart" a lesson about its own arrogance. It was later revealed that the London branch of Torchwood, called Torchwood One, lost 796 members of staff and was ultimately ordered to close by Queen Elizabeth II. The threat is ended when the Doctor and Rose Tyler manage to use Torchwood One's equipment to banish the Daleks and Cybermen into the Void between worlds and end the invasion.
In "The Runaway Bride", it is revealed that the London-based security firm "H. C. Clements" (which employed secretary Donna Noble (Catherine Tate), who inexplicably materialised in the TARDIS just as she was about to get married) was a front company for the Torchwood Institute. On a restricted basement level of the company situated beneath the Thames Barrier was a secret laboratory which the Institute used to recreate ancient "Huon particles". Over a period of months, H. C. Clements' Human Resources Manager, Lance Bennett (Don Gilet), had courted and poisoned Donna with Huon particles, intending to sacrifice her to the Empress of the Racnoss (Sarah Parish). It would appear that Lance was not acting on behalf of the Institute, and the lab was in disuse since the Battle of Canary Wharf and the Queen's official closure of Torchwood One.
In 2007, following Torchwood One's closure, Torchwood Three leader Captain Jack Harkness allows former Torchwood One researcher Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) to his team, and is no longer working under the authority of the headquarters in London; he is the "de facto" leader of the entire organization. This team would work together until later the same year, when the hiring of policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) coincided with the suicide of second-in-command Suzie Costello.
In "The Sound of Drums", Jack indicates to the Doctor that with Torchwood One gone, fewer than ten staff remain (between Wales and Scotland). He mentions that he rebuilt the Institute "in the Doctor's honour", with a new regime and a less aggressive stance. Outside the Institute's small workforce, journalists such as Vivien Rook (Nichola McAuliffe) of "The Sunday Mirror" investigate controversial figures such as Harold Saxon (John Simm) on behalf of the Institute. Saxon sent Torchwood Three on a 'wild goose chase' to the Himalayas to prevent them from helping Jack or the Doctor.
Torchwood Three later fought against the Daleks in their second invasion of Earth. Torchwood used the rift to make contact with the Doctor. Although they were incapacitated in the main battle, thanks to a time lock created by Tosh some time earlier that prevented them from escaping the Hub, Torchwood Three made a contribution to the Earth's return to the solar system by putting a lasso of temporal energy around the Earth with the help of K-9 (voiced by John Leeson) and Mr Smith (voiced by Alexander Armstrong), allowing the planet to be towed by the TARDIS.
Sometime prior to the 456 incident, Torchwood Two had closed down. Torchwood Three was the only force on Earth posed to combat the threat of the 456 invasion. However, Home Office Permanent Secretary John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) ordered the assassination of remaining Torchwood agents Harkness, Cooper and Jones to cover up the UK's history with the aliens. On receiving communication from the 456, the government orders the assassination of all Torchwood Three staff to stop them interfering with the operation. While they evade assassination, Jones dies in the line of duty and Harkness abandons the planet after having to kill his grandson. According to Joshua Naismith (David Harewood) in "The End of Time", the Institute is no longer functional, in December 2009. For a time, Torchwood is nothing more than a legend; Harkness and Cooper essentially re-establish the Institute with some Central Intelligence Agency agents in "" (2011), although new member Rex Matheson notes at one point that 'Torchwood' is essentially just a name given their current renegade status.
In the "Doctor Who" episode "Fear Her", set in 2012, Torchwood is public enough to be mentioned in a television broadcast during the London 2012 Olympics.
The future.
In this future, Torchwood is no longer a private organization and has branches all across the Torchwood Empire. At the center of the organization's new image is the Cardiff branch, a new building in the center of the city. The Rift Manipulator has been moved to the new building and has been plugged into a permanently comatose Jack Harkness, whose immortality allows the Rift to be held open safely, thus allowing two-way travel. The radio drama "Asylum" also suggests that Torchwood might gain control over the Rift in the near future, using it to send a half-alien girl back to the present day. Torchwood was also mentioned in the Doctor Who episode "Bad Wolf" when Rose is forced to play on a game show and one of the questions is about the remains of a Torchwood location.
In the 42nd century, the Torchwood Archives sent a group of explorers to investigate a mysterious power source that kept a planet in stable orbit around a black hole. By the 2002nd century, the Great Cobalt Pyramid has been built on the ruins of the Torchwood Institute.
Parallel universe.
In "Rise of the Cybermen", a parallel Earth Torchwood Institute is referred to. It is public enough for a survey carried out by it to be reported in a news item, and for someone to be publicly asked about their work there. Prior to "Army of Ghosts", a group led by Pete Tyler (and including Jake Simmonds and Mickey Smith), which worked for the alternate world's People's Republic, took over the parallel Earth Torchwood. The people of this alternate universe discovered what was going on at Torchwood and it became a re-developed organization run in full view of the public.
In "Doomsday", it is revealed that the parallel Earth Torchwood had also been conducting experiments on the spatial breach, which led (between "The Age of Steel" and "Army of Ghosts") to it being infiltrated by the Cybermen, who used the breach to travel to Rose's universe. Following the events of "Doomsday", Rose Tyler, confined to the alternate world, goes on to work for the reformed organization. From this accelerated parallel universe, Rose's Torchwood becomes aware of Davros's reality bomb and, given that it has broken the barriers between universes in her time, she is sent first in "Partners In Crime", having a brief interaction with Donna Noble, before returning in "Turn Left" to right an alternate timeline in which the Doctor has been killed, and later in "The Stolen Earth" to defend London and find the Doctor as Davros's plot is acted out in the Doctor's reality. She is followed shortly by Mickey and Jackie, armed with Torchwood-developed anti-Dalek weaponry, in "Journey's End".
Divisions of Torchwood.
Torchwood One, London.
Torchwood One was Torchwood's head office and operated out of Torchwood Tower, located within One Canada Square, the tallest of the three Canary Wharf skyscrapers, although it carried out operations across London, including beneath the Thames Barrier, and through front organizations such as "H. C. Clements". To those that have come in contact with Torchwood, they are primarily believed to be a special forces team. The beam which destroyed the Sycorax ship was fired from five different locations around London, suggesting a number of properties are owned by Torchwood One in the area. The tower installations were destroyed during the events of "Doomsday". According to the "Torchwood" website, there were 823 members of staff, of which only 27 were known to have survived. In the wake of the "Battle of Canary Wharf", Her Majesty ordered the immediate closure of Torchwood One. Some of the notable employees included:
Torchwood Two, Glasgow.
All that is known about the Glasgow division of the Torchwood Institute is that it is run by a "very strange man". In the novel "The Twilight Streets" (set in February 2008), Jack contacts the "very strange man" whose name is revealed as Archie, and Torchwood Two's headquarters are near the River Clyde. As with all spin-off media, the canonicity of this remains unclear. An e-mail shown in part one of "" (set in September 2009) suggests that Torchwood Two disbanded some time before the events of the 456, and that Torchwood Three is the only branch remaining.
Torchwood Three, Cardiff.
Torchwood Three, whose base is also known as the 'Torchwood Hub', primarily serves as a monitoring station for a rift in time and space that runs through Cardiff. The job of Torchwood Three is to monitor the rift and control and seize what comes through it. Whereas the London branch is originally staffed by hundreds of individuals, the Cardiff branch is considerably smaller and employs only a small team of experts, hired by Captain Jack and is described as a "renegade outpost". It is located beneath Roald Dahl Plass, and may be entered via an "invisible lift" in the Plass, which can't be seen because of the perception filter that resides on that spot, or through a run-down Tourist Information Centre nearby. Torchwood Three is the setting of the eponymous "Torchwood" series. It is said by Jack Harkness that the Cardiff Branch has nothing to do with London and that all links were severed. In ' (2009), the Hub was destroyed, Ianto died, and Jack abandoned Earth, leaving pregnant Gwen the only remaining Torchwood agent. "Doctor Who" two-parter "The End of Time" refers to the Institute as no longer existing. ' (2011) shows that Gwen similarly left Torchwood Three behind after the events of "Children of Earth". The Central Intelligence Agency believes all individuals previously affiliated with Torchwood to be dead.
Some notable employees include:
Whilst the Institute officially disbanded after the events of "Children of Earth" Jack and Gwen work with several individuals from the United States to solve the Miracle Day phenomenon. CIA operative Rex Matheson and analyst Esther Drummond join the operation in "Rendition". Surgeon Vera Juarez allies herself to the cause in "The Categories of Life" but is killed off on her first undercover mission.
Torchwood Four, location unknown.
Torchwood Four is described as "missing". It is not specified how this happened or where it may previously have been located before its disappearance. Captain Jack stated they would find it some day. In the novel "The Twilight Streets", Jack says that in 1941, Torchwood Four was still missing. In the novel "Risk Assessment", Torchwood's immortal assessor Agnes Haversham refers to Torchwood Four's disappearance as having been something of a messy business.
Torchwood India, Delhi.
An Indian branch of Torchwood introduced in the radio play "Golden Age". Torchwood India was founded by Queen Victoria to find alien technology in the British Raj. It was led by Eleanor, Duchess of Melrose, who maintained the branch's cover as a gentlemen's club named the Royal Connaught Club. It was closed down by Captain Jack in 1924, when Torchwood realised the Raj was coming to an end, and all their alien equipment was taken to Britain. In 2009 Jack and Torchwood Three trace an alien energy field to the site of Torchwood India, and discover Eleanor and the other Torchwood India agents are using a time store to prevent time passing in the Royal Connaught Club. The store is powered by taking people's potential futures, killing them. Torchwood Three prevent the Duchess's plan to turn the whole planet back to 1924, resulting in the time store overloading. The club members refuse to leave before the building is frozen in time.
Cultural influence.
Due to the popularity of "Doctor Who" and "Torchwood", Torchwood has had an influence on popular culture. On the heels of being featured in "Torchwood", Cardiff has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the UK, in particular, the Wales Millennium Centre, with a resident commenting that tourists often jump on the paving slab that was used as the "magic lift" in the series. In January 2008, such was the popularity of "Torchwood" that being near the "Torchwood Tower" was used in advertising for local property. A January 2009 article comments on the attraction the Torchwood 'Hub' has brought to the Wales Millennium Centre, as Minister for Heritage Alun Ffred Jones announced that resultingly, "the Wales Millennium Centre building itself is now established as a symbol of modern Welsh culture".

Diakofto–Kalavryta Railway

The Diakofto–Kalavryta Railway is a historic gauge rack railway in Greece. Located on the northern Peloponnese, it runs 22 km from Diakofto through the Vouraikos Gorge and the old Mega Spilaion Monastery and up to Kalavryta, stopping en route at Zachlorou.
The line was built by the Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways (SPAP). Currently the infrastructure and rolling stock are owned and maintained by Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE). Passenger trains are operated by TrainOSE.
Technical information.
The railway is single line with gauge. It climbs from sea level to 720 m in 22.3 km with a maximum gradient of 17.5%. There are three sections with Abt system rack for a total of 3.8 km. Maximum speed is 40 km/h for adhesion sections and 12 km/h for rack sections.
There are bridges over Vouraikos River at many locations and numerous tunnels. Passing loops exist at Niamata, Triklia, Zachlorou and Kerpini.
Rolling stock sheds and maintenance facilities are located at Diakofto. Additional facilities existed at Kalavrita station during the steam era but they are no longer in use.
The line was to be electrified and EMUs were ordered at Billard, France. Before the cars arrived, the plans for electrification were scrapped, the EMUs were thus not usable when they arrived. As a makeshift solution a power car carrying a diesel generator was placed in the middle of the two cars. This solution has worked very well for decades.
Current status and timetables.
OSE recently completed renovation work on the northern part of the line (major maintenance of bridges, enlargement of tunnels, replacement of the rack and testing of new rolling stock), during which the line was wholly or partly closed. Currently there is a limited service on weekdays with three trains on each direction and an extended service on weekends and public holidays with two additional trains.
Departures (as of Summer 2013) from Diakopto are at 08:45, 11:15 and 14:32 (Monday through Friday), 08:45, 11:15, 12:33, 14:32 and 15:52 (weekends). Return trips from Kalavrita depart at 09:57, 12:27, 15:50 (Monday through Friday), 09:57, 12:27, 14:30, 15:50 and 17:08 (weekends). Passengers buying a round-trip ticket from Diakopto and taking the first train to Kalavrita are allowed to return later in the day on any of the other trains. The trip each way is about an hour. Anyone considering this trip should know that the scenery is spectacular and the new trains are in perfect condition.
Rolling stock.
Steam locomotives.
Six steam locomotives were constructed specifically for this line, on a basic design by Cail (1891).
Diesel trainsets.
The first batch of modern rolling stock for the Diakofto-Kalavryta railway consists of three diesel-electric trainsets ("Class 3001") built by Billard in 1958. They were numbered "ΑΔΚ 01" to "ΑΔΚ 03", later renumbered as "ΑΒδφπτ 3001" to "ΑΒδφπτ 3003". Three similar trainsets ("Class 3004") built by Decauville were added in 1967. They were numbered "ΑΒδφπτ 3004" to "ΑΒδφπτ 3006". These trainsets, both types of similar configuration, consist of two passenger cars (a motor car and a control car) and a generator trailer or "OPE" () between them. In addition, a steam locomotive ("ΔΚ 8001", delivered by Cail in 1891) is preserved at Kalavryta station and has been used occasionally for special trains.
Four new three-car diesel-electric trainsets were ordered from Stadler Rail to replace the old rolling stock and entered service in 2009. These are designated as "Class 3107".

Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again

"Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again" is a 1973 hit single performed by Gary Glitter and co-written by Glitter and his producer Mike Leander. The title of the song is only sung once and as a result other more frequent sung lines have become alternative titles, these include "It's Good to Be Back" and "Did You Miss Me?". Sometimes the title is shortened to simply "Hello, Hello".
The song is about a man calling his lover after being away for some time and begins with "Did you miss me (yeah), while I was away?", with "Hello, hello, it's good to be back... Good to be back" sung repeatedly in the chorus. It reached number 2 in the United Kingdom, charting in several other countries and remained a popular oldie for decades. The song has been featured on a number of Glitter compilations and live albums since, as well as his 1973 studio album, "Touch Me". In 1995 the song returned to the UK charts when Glitter re-recorded it, under the title "Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again (Again!)".

The Winjin Pom

"The Winjin' Pom" is a television puppet series about a talking British caravan, renowned for his moaning, and five Australians who live and travel in him. The travelers who include Adelaide, Sydney, Bruce, Frazer, and Darwin (respectively a wallaby, an ostrich, a spider, a fruit bat, and a wombat), are members of the Gullagaloona backpackers club and are on a mission to travel the world.
Discovering the caravan near London when lost, the travelers soon find the Winjin' Pom to be one of their biggest allies. A mafia-like team headed by evil Hammond organ playing vulture J.G. Chicago discover the caravan's ability to speak and decide to hijack it in a sinister plot to make themselves rich.
Part of this mafia gang includes two villainous crows, who are brothers. Ronnie and Reggie ("The Crows") relentlessly chase the caravan and follow the backpackers on their travels in an attempt to steal it, always, of course, failing miserably.
The Winjin' Pom (the name is a pun on the "whinging pom", an Aussie expression used to refer to a person of British origin who constantly complains about things he has to face) caravan is famous not only for talking but also for flying, something which occurs several episodes in after a hijack by The Crows. This talking-flying caravan was not seen by many people and the series did not air for long.
Written by Richard Carpenter the television series appears to be aimed at teenagers, while it actually contains some impressive dialogue that convey a certain grittiness now and then, making it similar in spirit to The Simpsons TV show. The series particularly revolves around the friendly, joking banter on stereotypes: the grumpy Brit and adventurous Australian. 
The Winjin' Pom was broadcast in 1991 on commercial television and is owned by Spitting Image Productions and HIT Entertainment PLC. It was directed by Steve Bendelack and is not currently shown on any television network, nor is it available to own on video or DVD. Allegedly, the rights are available for purchase.
Main characters.
The Winjin' Pom: a talking, flying (and moaning) British van who acts as a way of transport for the protagonists. Depressive, pessimistic, and prone to self-pitying, Pom tends to see everything in a negative light, but he is nonetheless loyal to his friends, and it is often up to him to save the day when they're in a pinch.
Adelaide: a boyish female wallaby and the unofficial leader of the bunch; cranky and quick to retort, she's a real tomboy and could be seen as a feminist, compared to the more feminine Sydney. Adelaide is also skilled in mechanics and can be seen repairing Pom now and then. Named after Adelaide, a city in Australia.
Sydney: a snobbish female ostrich with a taste for bragging and luxury... She complains a lot, and equally seems to annoy the others in return. She's usually the first one to duck and cover in case of danger, usually stuffing her head into a fireman's bucket. She also insists on being referred to as a cassowary, and not an ostrich... Named after Sydney, Australia's largest city.
Darwin: a middle-aged male wombat, Darwin is probably the most sensitive of the group, being an amateur poet and romantic. Clumsy, naive to a fault, and easily bewildered, he seems to get on Adelaide and Sydney's nerves a lot, and gets repeatedly called a wimp by his mates. Probably named after another city in Australia, which in turn was named after Charles Darwin.
Frazer: a male fruit bat with a laid-back attitude. A good-hearted, tolerant young guy, Frazer is a cricket fanatic and has a taste for bananas. He's also good friend with Bruce. Named after Charles Fraser, a 19th-century botanist and explorer of Australia. Also, in Australia, an island known as Frazer is home to living fruit bats.
Bruce: an enthusiastic, wise-cracking red-back spider, Bruce's humor is just as deadly as his venom... Though loyal to his friends, he is a troublemaker and tends to annoy them somewhat, save for Frazer who seems to appreciate him. Upon meeting someone for the first time, Bruce's first question is usually "Can I bite him?"
J.G. Chicago : the heroes' main nemesis, a cold-hearted, calculating vulture who seems to be a sort of powerful underworld boss. A lover of opera, he is sustained by a complex medical apparatus and enjoys playing Hammond organ. J.G. is bent on stealing the Winjin' Pom and using his special abilities for his own benefits.
Ronnie and Reggie, the Crow Twins: a pair of nasty but single-minded crows, Ronnie and Reggie are twin brothers, and J.G.'s snivelling, incompetent associates. They occasionally manage to hijack the Winjin' Pom, but systematically end up failing. Named after the Kray Twins, the famous London gangland mobsters.
Howard: a male spotted hyena and J.G.'s right hand. Somewhat clumsy and less evil that he'd want to let believe, he has a knack for putting himself into impossible situations. Poor Howard is also clearly terrified by J.G. and appears a little pathetic when he has to face his boss' outbursts of anger. It is also vaguely hinted that Howard is gay.

USB human interface device class

In computing, the USB human interface device class (USB HID class) is a part of the USB specification for computer peripherals: it specifies a device class (a type of computer hardware) for human interface devices such as keyboards, mice, game controllers and alphanumeric display devices.
The USB HID class is defined in a number of documents provided by the USB Implementers Forum's Device Working Group. The primary document used to describe the USB HID class is the Device Class Definition for HID 1.11.
Devices.
The USB HID class describes devices used with nearly every modern computer. Many predefined functions exist in the USB HID class. These functions allow hardware manufacturers to design a product to USB HID class specifications and expect it to work with any software that also meets these specifications.
The same HID protocol is used unmodified in Bluetooth human interface devices. The Bluetooth profile specification only points readers to the USB HID documentation. In this sense those devices also belong to the USB HID class.
Drivers.
One of the benefits of a well-defined specification like the USB HID class is the abundance of device drivers available in most modern operating systems. The USB HID class devices and their basic functions are defined in USB-IF documentation without any specific software in mind. Because of these generic descriptions, it is easy for operating system designers to include functioning drivers for devices such as keyboards, mice, and other generic human interface devices. The inclusion of these generic drivers allows for faster deployment of devices and easier installation by end-users.
Logical specifications.
Functional characteristics.
The USB human interface device class can be used to describe both device and interface classes. The interface class is used when a USB device can contain more than one function. It is possible, therefore, to have USB devices with two different interfaces at the same time (for example, a USB telephone may use a keypad covered by the HID class and a speaker covered by the USB audio device class).
The interface devices are also defined with subclass descriptors. The subclass descriptor is used to declare a device bootable. A boot device meets a minimum adherence to a basic protocol and will be recognized by a computer's BIOS.
Each USB HID interface communicates with the host using either a "control" pipe or an "interrupt" pipe. "Isochronous" and "bulk" pipes are not used in HID class devices. Both IN and OUT control transfers are required for enumeration; only an IN interrupt transfer is required for HID reports. OUT interrupt transfers are optional in HID-class devices.
Reports.
The USB HID class requires that every device describes how it will communicate with the host device in order to accurately predict and define all current and future human interface devices. During enumeration the device describes how its reports are to be structured so that the host device can properly prepare to receive this information.
The host periodically polls the device's interrupt IN endpoint during operation. When the device has data to send it forms a report and sends it as a reply to the poll token. Common devices such as keyboards and mice send reports that are compliant with standards set by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). When a vendor makes a custom USB HID class device, the reports formed by the device need to match the report description given during enumeration and the driver installed on the host system. In this way it is possible for the USB HID class to be extremely flexible.
USB HID API.
There are two levels of APIs related to USB HID: the USB level and the operating system level. At the USB level, there is a protocol for devices to announce their capabilities and the operating system to parse the data it gets. The operating system then offers a higher-level view to applications, which do not need to include support for individual devices but for classes of devices. This abstraction layer allows a game to work with any USB controller, for example, even ones created after the game.

Mikhail Tereshchenko

Mikhail Ivanovich Tereshchenko (; ) (18 March 1886, Kiev – 1 April 1956, Monaco) was the foreign minister of Russia from 5 May 1917 to 25 October 1917. He was also a major Ukrainian landowner, owner of several sugar factories, and financier.
Biography.
Born to a rich Tereshchenko family of a sugar factory owners, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and art patrons of Ivan Nikolayevich (1854–1903) and Yelizaveta Mikhailovna. Mikhail had a younger brother Mykola (1894-?). His uncle Aleksandr Tereshchenko (1856–1911) worked in Saint-Petersburg. Mikhail Tereshchenko graduated from Kiev University and Leipzig University. In 1910, he joined the Freemasonry and became one of the five prominent Masons in Russia (the other four being Alexander Konovalov, Alexander Kerensky, Nikolai Nekrasov, and Ivan Yefremov). Mikhail Tereshchenko was a member of the Fourth State Duma (he shared the views of the Russian Progressive Party). In 1912–1914, Tereshchenko was the owner of a private publishing house "Sirin" in St Petersburg, which published Andrey Bely's pioneering novel Petersburg in three installments in 1913-14. During World War I, he took part in organizing the Red Cross hospitals. In 1915–1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was the chairman of the Military Industry Committee of the Kiev district and deputy chairman of the All-Russian Military Industry Committee. After the February Revolution of 1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was appointed Minister of Finance of the Provisional Kerensky Government. In April 1917, Tereshchenko (together with Kerensky and Nekrasov) was actively seeking to create a governmental interparty coalition with the Socialists. On 5 May 1917, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs after the resignation of Pavel Milyukov. Tereshchenko continued his foreign policy course, which led to his conflict with Minister of War Alexander Verkhovsky, who had considered Russia to be unable to continue the war. He was a member of the Directory in 1917. Tereshchenko was known to support the Ukrainian government that led to the establishment and recognition of the General Secretariat in Ukraine 1917.
On the night of 26 October, Mikhail Tereshchenko was arrested in the Winter Palace with other ministers of the Provisional Government and placed into the Peter and Paul Fortress. In the spring of 1918, he escaped from prison and fled to Norway with the Tereshchenko blue diamond and then France. Tereshchenko was one of the supporters of allied intervention in Soviet Russia. In 1920s and 1930s, he was engaged in financial activities in France and Madagascar.

Craig Calonica

Craig Calonica is a mountain climber and skier from the United States.
History.
Craig Calonica represented the US Ski Team in Speed Skiing from 1974 to 1987 where he consistently placed among the top 5 and 10 in the world. He is also a climber and has climb many big walls in Yosemite National Park and to date has climbed over 28 big wall routes mostly on El Capitan.[http://www.supertopo.com/climbingareas/bigwalls.html] He is also an accomplished Alpine climber and has climbed in Alaska, Nepal, Tibet, Chile, Argentina, Europe, throughout the US, etc. 2008 marked his 27th year in Nepal's Himalaya, during this time he has become the leading pioneer of skiing in Nepal's Himalaya and has made hundreds of first descents.
During the winter of 1981/82 Calonica was a member of the Everest Grand Circle expedition the goal was to circumnavigate Everest, his was the first team that trekked, skied, around the peak in both Tibet and Nepal. During this expedition the team also made a first ascent of Pumori 7,161 m in the winter, it was the second successful winter ascent in Nepal, and the first winter ascent of a new route.
In August & September 1996, 1997 and 1998 he attempted to ski down Everest’s North Face, but due to the constant monsoon weather was never able to reach the summit. Unfortunately the best time to ski Everest from its summit is during the monsoon season, thus why the prize of skiing Everest from its summit has been elusive. http://classic.mountainzone.com/climbing/skieverest/updates.html]
On October 21, 1998, after skiing on the Chinese side of Everest, the California adventurer told Reuters reporters that he was convinced he had spotted the legendary yeti twice, “I saw something that was not human, that was not a gorilla, not a deer, not a goat and not a bear," he told them.

Semie Moseley

Semie Moseley (June 13, 1935 – August 7, 1992) was a luthier, and the founder of Mosrite 
He was born in Durant, Oklahoma in 1935. His family migrated to California along a path similar to many "Bakersfield Okies", first moving to Chandler, Arizona in 1938, and two years later in Bakersfield, California. Semie’s mother worked in a dry cleaner’s shop, his father with the Southern Pacific Railroad.
In Bakersfield, Moseley started playing guitar in an evangelical group at age 13.
Semie and his brother Andy experimented with guitars since teen-age years, refinishing instruments and building new necks.
In 1954 Semie built a triple-neck guitar in his garage (the longest neck was a standard guitar, the second-longest neck an octave higher, the shortest was an eight-string mandolin). He presented a double-neck to Joe Maphis, a Los Angeles-area TV performer. By 1956, with an investment from Reverend Ray Boatright, a local Los Angeles minister, Semie and Andy started their company, Mosrite of California. Semie, who built guitars for the L.A.-based Rickenbacker company, said to his co-workers that he was making his own product, and he was fired by Rickenbacker.
When they began, their production was all custom, handmade guitars, built in garages, tin storage sheds, wherever the Moseleys could put equipment.
In 1959, Andy moved to Nashville, Tennessee for a year to popularize the Mosrite name and sold a few to Grand Ole Opry entertainers, people, and to road musicians. Andy said: "And that’s how we kept the factory going at the time: custom guitars".
He and Andy also got into the recording business by establishing Mosrite Records. They signed Barbara Mandrell, a teenage daughter of Irby Mandrell, an Oceanside, California music-store owner who sold Mosrite guitars. They also signed guitarist Ronny Sessions and others.
At the peak of production in 1968, Semie and his brother Andy, with their crew of 107 employees were making 1,000 Mosrite guitars per month which included acoustics, standard electrics, double-necks, triple-necks, basses, dobros, even mandolins.
Mosrite of California went bankrupt in late 1968 after they contracted with a competitor to market their guitars. After this, they tried to deal directly with stores, and they sold 280 guitars in 1969 before they came to the shop one day and found their doors pad-locked.
Two years after his bankruptcy, Semie was able to get back the Mosrite name, and in 1970 he started making guitars again in Pumpkin Center near Bakersfield. He moved his factory three times in the next 20 years, to Oklahoma City in the mid-70s, to the township of Jonas Ridge, in Burke County, North Carolina in 1981, and to Booneville, Arkansas in 1991.
Six months after moving to Arkansas, Semie Moseley became ill with bone cancer and six weeks later, in August 1992, he died.
Semie's daughter, Dana, is also a luthier and continues to build Mosrite guitars. She also helps kick off the monthly "Mosrite Jam" in Bakersfield.

<doc id="4877371" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877371" title="Northwest Afternoon">
Northwest Afternoon

Northwest Afternoon (also known at times as NWA) was a local television talk show in the United States. It aired weekdays at 3PM in the Puget Sound area of Washington. It was produced locally by Seattle TV station KOMO-TV Channel 4, and debuted in September 1984. The series ended its run on September 5, 2008 after a nearly successful 24 year run.
Format.
The show's format, unchanged since its debut, began with a 15-minute daily recap of soap opera serials aired that day, with the last 45 minutes being a talk/variety-type show. In the latter portion of the show, subjects could vary from show to show. In one show, a famous TV, movie, or newsmaking celebrity may make an appearance as a special guest (usually discussing their latest work, etc.), while the very next day could focus on a guest who has survived against all odds. 
The show originated from Studio C of KOMO-TV's old building until it was demolished to make way for Fisher Plaza in 2000.
On June 10, 2008 KOMO-TV announced that "Northwest Afternoon" was cancelled because of increased competition against first-run syndicated fare from "Dr. Phil" on KING-TV, "Rachael Ray" on KIRO-TV, and "Maury" on KCPQ. These shows had made inroads into Northwest Afternoon's once-comfortable ratings, making it difficult for station management to continue producing the show. The stunning announcement came after the series won a local Emmy. A 24-year retrospective send-off was aired on September 4, 2008, with the last show airing on September 5. The show was replaced by "The Doctors", a syndicated show that premiered on September 8, 2008.
The cancellation of "Northwest Afternoon" came as a surprise considering many stations across the country are adding more local programs to their daytime schedules including KGO-TV in San Francisco with "The View from the Bay", KSTP-TV in Minneapolis with "Twin Cities Live", KUSA-TV in Denver with "Colorado & Company", WXIA in Atlanta with "Atlanta & Company", KXTV in Sacramento with "Sacramento & Company", and KSDK in St. Louis with "Show Me St. Louis", just to name a few.
Hosts.
The original hosts of the show were Dick Foley and Dana Middleton, with the soap-opera recap portion of the show hosted by Cindi Rinehart. Dana Middleton left in 1992 to pursue other interests. Her departure was an emotional moment, and her last show was filled with recaps of previous shows. Middleton's replacement was Elisa Jaffe, a reporter and morning news anchor for KOMO News who had also launched the "Morning Express," the station's first hour-long morning newscast in 1987. Dick Foley followed suit in 1996, and was replaced by KPLZ radio host Kent Phillips (who had been filling in on occasion for Cindi Rinehart for a few years prior). Out of the current hosts of the show, Cindi Rinehart was the only remaining host since the show's debut in 1984.
The main portion of the program was most recently hosted by Kent Phillips, with rebroadcasts of segments co-hosted by Natasha Curry (who joined Northwest Afternoon in 2007), and KOMO News reporter Rachelle Murcia.
"Scope on the Soaps".
"Scope on the Soaps" was the opening segment, usually 15–20 minutes in length, in which Cindi Rinehart gave viewers a daily recap of the happenings in the soap opera world. Her awkward style became legendary, and she earned a "backstage-pass" into the behind-the-scenes production of all the major dramas on daytime TV. Her "Scope on the Soaps" segment was frequented - either in person or over live telephone calls - by major soap stars and producers, and Cindi herself has even starred in soaps such as "General Hospital". Because of her expertise, she has been dubbed "The Soap Queen."
Reinhart also attracted a lot fans beyond the Northwest. Since the show was also seen across Canada on satellite, it was not uncommon for viewers to call as far away as Nova Scotia and Quebec just to ask Cindi questions about what will happen on the soaps, a rarity for a locally produced---and American based---afternoon talk show.
Notable guests.
Other notable guests include much of KOMO's own on-air staff. KOMO news anchors Dan Lewis, Kathi Goertzen, and several KOMO TV reporters have made appearances on "Northwest Afternoon" over the years.

Shutter (2004 film)

Shutter (Thai: ชัตเตอร์ กดติดวิญญาณ) is a 2004 Thai horror film by Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom; starring Ananda Everingham, Natthaweeranuch Thongmee, and Achita Sikamana. It focuses on mysterious images seen in developed pictures.
The film was remade in 2008 under the same title.
Plot.
After celebrating at a drinking party with his close friends, Tun (Ananda Everingham), a photographer, and Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee), get into a car accident. Jane hits a young woman. With much fear and bewilderment, Tun prohibits her from getting out of the car: they drive away, leaving the girl lying on the road.
Tun begins to discover mysterious white shadows and what appear to be faces in his photographs. A suspicious Jane thinks these images may be the ghost of the girl they hit on the road. Tun, who has been experiencing severe neck pains since the accident, visits a specialist. While a nurse attempts to measure his weight, to his dismay, he weighs approximately 120 kilograms (264 pounds). While collecting his medication via the counter, he hears a woman's voice that accuses him of being a liar and he runs away, traumatized. Unconvinced of the existence of the supernatural, Tun dismisses the idea of being haunted although his friends are also being disturbed by this mysterious girl.
Jane begins to investigate in the school's lab and discovers that the girl was Natre (Achita Sikamana), a shy young woman who had attended the same college as Tun. After confronting Tun, Tun admits that he and Natre were in a relationship, which Tun had kept secret from his friends. Natre loved Tun dearly and threatened to commit suicide when Tun abruptly broke off the relationship. Tun witnesses his friend, Tonn, committing suicide by jumping from his apartment balcony. Tun discovers that his two other close friends from college have also committed suicide. Believing that they have been coerced into doing so by Natre's ghost, Tun becomes convinced that he will be next.
The haunting of Tun by Natre's ghost escalates, so he and Jane visit Natre's mother. At her house, they discover the decaying body of Natre in her bedroom. They learn that Natre had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of a hospital, but her mother could not bear to have her cremated. Tun and Jane spend the night in a hotel, where Tun wakes up and is confronted by Natre's ghost. Tun tries to escape but is pursued; ultimately, while trying to get away, he falls off a fire escape and is injured. Natre's funeral is held the following day, after which Jane hopes that everything will return to normal.
However, on returning to Bangkok, Jane collects some photographs. One of the films shows a series of shadowy images of Natre crawling towards the bookcase in Tun's apartment. Investigating further, Jane finds a set of negatives hidden behind the bookcase. She develops the negatives to find photographs in which Tun's friends—the ones who committed suicide—are sexually assaulting Natre. Utterly disgusted by her findings and now convinced that Natre tried to warn her, a teary Jane confronts Tun. Tun admits that he witnessed the rape but did nothing to stop his friends, and that he was the one who had taken those photos. He says he did it out of peer pressure and has never forgiven himself, but Jane leaves him.
Knowing that he is still haunted by Natre, Tun takes a series of Polaroid photographs in his apartment in an attempt to find her. Having no success, he throws the camera across the room in a rage, only for it to go off, taking a photograph of Tun, revealing Natre sitting on Tun's shoulders. In the ensuing confrontation, Tun jumps from the window, trying to escape from Natre.
The final scene shows a badly bandaged Tun slumping over in a hospital bed while Jane visits him. As the door swings closed behind Jane, the glass reflection shows Natre still sitting on his shoulders.

Nandha

Nandha () is a 2001 Indian Tamil drama film written and directed by Bala, starring Suriya and Laila in the leading roles, while Rajkiran, Saravanan and Rajshree play other supporting roles. The film also marked the debut of comedian Karunas, whilst its music was scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja and cinematography handled by R. Rathnavelu. The film released on 14 November 2001 and received critical acclaim & was a Commercial success.
Plot.
Nandha is a movie about a young man from a juvenile jail coming back to a society and his family he had left many years ago. It is about a battle of love and life and how a misfit tries to fight to fit into the usual social circus, a fight to earn his mother's love and a fight to live the second chance he has given himself.
Nandha (Surya) is sent to a rehabilitation center for murdering his father as a boy. He returns home to a mother, who is deaf and mute, and a sister who are still in a state of shock after what has happened to their family.
He decides to get a new life by trying to give himself a college education. Having the record of being an ex-convict he finds it difficult to get a seat in a college. He meets Periyavar (Raj Kiran), a disciplinarian college principal who runs his college with an iron hand. Periyavar develops a soft corner for Nandha and guides him like his own son. Kalyani (Laila), a Tamil exile from SriLanka meets Nandha and both fall in love. Meanwhile the villain Saravanan asks Periyavar who also helps Sri Lankan students in his college a lot to aid an anti-social element, but Periyavar refuses outright.
But Periyavar's son-in-law agrees to help Saravanan. Meanwhile Periyavar falls sick and gets admitted in the hospital. Nandha stays around to look after his mentor and guide. Fearing what he has done might be out in the light, the son-in-law pulls out the oxygen tube of Periyavar in the hospital when Nandha is not around and blames Nandha for murdering his father-in-law. Nandha, having to deal with the pain of losing the only man who gave him a second chance to live, also struggles the fray of being convicted of murder once again and he chooses to kill Periyavar's son-in-law in the court campus. The case is dismissed due to the lack of evidence. Finally he is acquitted as there are no eyewitnesses to the murder.
After being acquitted for Periyavar's son-in-law's murder he returns home. His paranoid mother who still believes that her son still has murder instincts waits at home to feed a meal, which she has poisoned herself. He finds out that the food is poisoned when he eats it, but continues to do so with a satisfaction that he is being fed by his mother. He dies in his mother's lap and when his sister and Kalyani come out to see what has happened, they realise that both mother and son are dead.
Production.
The title role was initially offered to Ajith Kumar, who rejected the film citing that Bala had not fully developed the story and screenplay before narrating the terms to him. Suriya, who had notably also replaced Ajith Kumar in "Nerukku Ner" to make his debut, was selected as his replacement. The director also tried to rope in Sivaji Ganesan for a character role in the film, but his unavailability led to Rajkiran being cast. Laila was signed on as heroine to play a Sri Lankan refugee.
The role required Suriya to undergo physical change, so production was delayed until Suriya had finished filming for "Friends" and "Uyirile Kalanthathu". The first look of the film created media anticipation, with both Suriya and Rajkiran sporting looks which they had not portrayed before. Post-release, Suriya has stated "when "Nandha" happened, everything changed. I became a serious actor, and director Bala instilled in me the discipline to work without committing errors."
Release.
The critic from The Hindu that "best performance by the surya, a neat screenplay and narration without any deviations in the form of dance or song make "Nandhaa" best watching. Bala's direction makes viewing a gripping experience. Rajkiran shines in the role of Periyavar. A surprise, however, is Rajashri, who reveals great histrionic skills." In comparison Rediff.com stated the film sucessed to live up to expectations, likening it to Kamal Haasan's "Aalavandhan" and stated that "the screenplay is smooth and incident-driven. In the final analysis, it is the climax that may be the different this film."
Prior to the release nandha film faced many trouble,The film was been telecasted in tv channels during first week of the film release but bala's power the film get big hit response in theatre.The film has been dubbed and released in the Telugu language three times, firstly as "Aakrosham" (2006) and then as "Pratheekaram" in 2009. A third dubbed version titled "Bala-Surya" was released by Nagamalla Shankar in 2011, shortly after the release of Bala's "Avan Ivan. However suryas performance was praised more than the movie.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, son of noted composer Ilaiyaraaja, who usually scores the music for a Bala film. The soundtrack was released on 21 October 2001 at Hotel Connemara, Chennai by actor Kamal Haasan and director Bharathiraja. It features 6 tracks, out of which two were sung by Ilaiyaraaja. The songs "Amma Endrale" and "Orayiram" are based on the raaga Pantuvarali.

<doc id="4877391" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877391" title="Ajristan District">
Ajristan District

Ajristan (), also spelled Ajeristan, is a district in the western part of Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. Its population was estimated at 62,028 in 2001, of which 97% are Ghaliji Pashtun people of the Mulla khail Tribe with others from the Hazara Tribe. Sangar, in the center of the district, is the capital. Most of the population live in the Jikhai River valley and depend upon agriculture, the main source of its economy. The last decade of severe winters and droughts have affected the economy and quality of life.
Geography.
Ajristan has an area of and consists of a series of valleys. The hills Shah Tus Aka Ghar and Koishafil surround Ajristan and act as natural barriers. There are no natural boundaries between Ajristan and adjoining districts of Malistan to the northeast, Ghizao and Sangi Masha to the east, and Daya Chopan. The closest major city is Ghazni to the west. Ajristan lies in the lap of several mountain ranges, which are the extensions of Shah Tus Baba, so a larger part consists of high mountains and hills. The ranges are irregularly placed: some extend to the west; others to the east, but the general direction is north-south. The mountain ranges enclose many small valleys. In the middle of the valley passes the Jikhai River, a major source of water, especially for agriculture.
Demographics.
Ajristan was historically part of Uruzgan Province, when it was called Daya. Hazara Rorrall captured the district in 1800. It was mentioned in a treaty by Mullakhail Khan that ended a local civil war. The district is dominated by the Pashtun followed by the minority Hazara people. Pashto is the language spoken by majority of Ajristani residents. Other languages include Persian. Pashton peoples in this area originate mostly from the Mulla Khail Tribe.
Climate.
Ajristan has a semi-arid climate with a significant temperature variation between summer and winter. Summer starts in late May and continues until early September with average temperatures ranging from 24–26 °C (75–78 °F). The highest recorded temperature is on 10 July 1998. Autumn begins in late September and continues until mid-November with average temperatures in the 12–18 °C (55–65 °F) range. Winter starts in late November and ends in late March, with average temperatures near 4–5 °C (39–41 °F). The lowest recorded temperature was on 8 January 1970. Spring starts in early April and ends in late May with average temperatures near 15 °C (60 °F). Unlike areas to the east, Ajristan does not have a monsoon season of heavy rainfall. Highest recorded rainfall within 24 hours is on 17 December 2000. Highest recorded monthly rainfall is in March 1982, and the highest recorded annual rainfall was in 1982. Snowfall occurs primarily in December, January, and February and is the principal precipitation in the winter.
During a severe drought from 1999 to 2001, Ajristan did not receive any snowfall, and rainfall was below normal levels. In 2003, the district received significant snowfall after a long drought. In 2004 and 2005, it received normal rains for the first time in three years with some snowfall, while in 2006, 2007, and 2009, the district received no snow. In 2008, Ajristan received four inches of snow in four hours on 29 January 2008. On 2 February 2008, Ajristan received ten inches of snow in 10 hours, the heaviest snowfall for the district in the last ten years. During the winter of 2010, it received no snow and suffered below normal levels of rainfall due to El-Nino.
Economy.
The severe droughts and winters have taken a toll on the economy, which is based mostly on agriculture and other locally grown products. A 2009 paper describes Ajristan residents "eating alfalfa, which is...detrimental to the human digestive system," a problem compounded by the lack of adequate medical care in the area. Most karezes have dried, so the district relies on a few wells and the Jikhai River for water.

Taco salad

The taco salad is a Mexican-inspired dish, with many variations, which first appeared in America in the 1960s.
Ingredients.
The salad is often served as a fried flour tortilla shell stuffed with shredded iceberg lettuce and topped with diced tomatoes, shredded Cheddar cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. The salad is topped with taco meat (ground beef) or seasoned shredded chicken. The salad may also have a base of refried beans and/or Spanish rice on the shell before the lettuce is added.
The taco salad also takes a twist in many American homes. Instead of using a tortilla or a bowl of Spanish rice as a base, the meal is based on top of crushed tortilla chips, making the dish similar to the Mexican dish of nachos, with the addition of lettuce and unmelted cheese.

Bartholomäus Aich

Bartholomäus Aich was a South-German organist and composer in the 17th century. Little is known about his life: originally from the village of Uttenweiler near Biberach an der Riß in Upper Swabia, he was the organist of the convent of canonesses in Lindau/Lake Constance.
His only surviving work is the musical-dramatic festival play "Armamentarium comicum amoris et honoris" (The Comic Armory of Love and Honor), written on the occasion of the wedding of Count Maximilian Willibald of Waldburg-Wolfegg and Clara Isabella Princess of Aarschot and Arenberg, that took place in Lindau on December 6, 1648. "Armamentarium" combined the Jesuit theatre tradition with the Italian monody of the early Baroque period and was performed by pupils of the Lindau Jesuit college on December 8, 1648. It is one of the earliest surviving examples of an operatic work performed in Germany. 
The libretto (by an unknown author) is highly allegorical and focussed on the heraldic symbols that the combined coat of arms of the bridal couple would contain. These allegories are introduced by biblical figures from the Old Testament. Since that custom-made plot was not appropriate for performances beyond the original purpose, the work vanished into oblivion. It was recently rediscovered in the musical collections of the Dukes of Waldburg-Wolfegg and performed at Schloss Wolfegg on September 11, 2005, by the Hassler-Consort ensemble, conducted by Franz Raml.

HNoMS King Haakon VII

HNoMS "King Haakon VII", was a Royal Norwegian Navy escort ship during World War II, named after King Haakon VII of Norway. She was gifted to the RNoN by the United States on 16 September 1942, in the presence of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Norwegian Crown Princess Märtha.
Handover ceremony.
The original intention of the US authorities had been to hand over the warship to the exiled Norwegians on 3 August 1942, on the 70th birthday of King Haakon VII. This plan could however not be carried out as Crown Princess Märtha was going spend that day with her father-in-law the King in London and the handover date was postponed.
During the handover ceremony Roosevelt delivered his famous "Look to Norway" - speech.
"King Haakon VII" was formerly part of the U.S. Navy as USS "PC 467". The ship was built in Neponset, Massachusetts where she was launched on 29 April 1942.
Norwegian service.
HNoMS "King Haakon VII", under her first commander kapteinløytnant (Lieutenant) Leif R. Lund, was first based at Halifax. Later on she was moved to Red Bay in Newfoundland and Labrador. In November 1942 she took part in the escorting of eastbound transatlantic convoy SC-108. This trip showed that the small vessel was not sturdy enough for transatlantic escorting and after a spell in the UK she relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in May 1943. For the rest of World War II "King Haakon VII" escorted convoys on the coast of North and Central America, from the coast of Labrador to the Caribbean. During her war service "King Haakon VII" sailed and escorted 79 convoys without accidents. No men were lost or seriously injured on the "King Haakon VII" during the war years. From 3 May to 2 June 1945 "King Haakon VII" was at Key West for maintenance and repairs, this delaying her the start of her return voyage to Norway until 4 June. On 26 June 1945 "King Haakon VII" arrived at the southern Norwegian port of Kristiansand.
Decommissioning and sale.
She was decommissioned on 1 February 1951 and laid up in Trondheim. On 26 June 1952 the Norwegian Parliament decided that "King Haakon VII" was to be decommissioned and sold off. In August 1953 she was sold to Rogaland Sjøguttskole () for .

Category of elements

In category theory, if C is a category and formula_1 is a set-valued functor, the category of elements of F formula_2 (also denoted by ∫CF) is the category defined as follows:
A more concise way to state this is that the category of elements of F is the comma category formula_9, where formula_10 is a one-point set. The category of elements of F comes with a natural projection formula_11 that sends an object (A,a) to A, and an arrow formula_6 to its underlying arrow in C.
The category of elements of a presheaf.
Somewhat confusingly in some texts (e.g. Mac Lane, Moerdijk), the category of elements for a presheaf is defined differently. If formula_13 is a presheaf, the category of elements of P (again denoted by formula_14, or, to make the distinction to the above definition clear, ∫C P) is the category defined as follows:
As one sees, the direction of the arrows is reversed. One can, once again, state this definition in a more concise manner: the category just defined is nothing but formula_21. Consequentially, in the spirit of adding a "co" in front of the name for a construction to denote its opposite, one should rather call this category the category of coelements of P.
For C small, this construction can be extended into a functor ∫C from formula_22 to formula_23, the category of small categories. In fact, using the Yoneda lemma one can show that ∫CP formula_24, where formula_25 is the Yoneda embedding. This isomorphism is natural in P and thus the functor ∫C is naturally isomorphic to formula_26.

Andrew Houston

Andrew Houston (Born March 20, 1850 – September 1920 ) was born in Doonbreeda, Nephin, County Mayo; later moving to Rossendale, credited as the Rossendale Bard.
Life.
Andrew Houston was a Rossendale Irishman, the author of a book of Poems and Songs (many of which had appeared previously in the Rossendale Free Press) published in 1912 and printed by J. J. Riley of Rawtenstall. Andrew Houston was born on March 20, 1850 in the village of Doonbreeda at the foot of Nephin Hill, West Mayo.
His father was a village school-master in Rathkeale and was well known in County Mayo as a writer of verses and songs. Andrew left Ireland and came to live at Newchurch-in-Rossendale when he was eleven years old and he worked in the local mills until 1880 when he became a commercial traveller. He eventually moved to Derbyshire but he loved to visit Rossendale of his adolescent years, and “camp” his old friends.
In the preface of his book Poems and Songs, S. A. Sutcliffe of Southport describes him as a man who had a well-contented look and a jolly eye and who was fond of ease and freedom. From his writings it can be seen that he liked people and liked to roam over the moors of the Rossendale area and had deep affection for both the Valley and his old Irish home.
He pays tribute to the friendliness of Bacup folk in his poem “Bonny Owd Bacup” and many old Rossendalians live on in his pages—Mr. Terry, the schoolmaster, Turn o’ Mary’s, owd navvy Jackson, and Ormy Deighn and other members of the old Edgeside Drum and Fife Band, to mention a few. His song Molly Magee evokes memories of the summers before the First World War when the Irish haymakers, experts with the scythe and hard workers, came over every year to work for the local farmers. He wrote more than a hundred poems and songs.

Phanom District

Phanom () is a district ("Amphoe") in the southwest of Surat Thani Province of southern Thailand.
Geography.
The district is located within the hills of the Phuket mountain range, with around 60% of the area consisting of mountains and forests. The northwestern part of the district is protected in the Khao Sok national park, in the southwest the Khlong Phanom National Park. The district marks the eastern end of the pass through the mountains, connecting Takua Pa with Surat Thani. This historic pass along the Sok river valley is now the route of Thailand Route 401.
Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Ban Ta Khun, Khiri Rat Nikhom, Khian Sa and Phrasaeng of Surat Thani, Plai Phraya of Krabi Province, Thap Put, Mueang Phang Nga, Kapong, Takua Pa and Khura Buri of Phang Nga Province.
History.
The district was created in 1890, at that time named "Khlong Cha Un" (คลองชะอุ่น). It was later renamed to Phak Phanom (ปากพนม), as the district office was moved to a new located at Phak Phanom, which was then shortened to simply Phanom. The first district officer was Khun Phanom Thana Rak. In 1910 the district was reduced to a minor district ("king amphoe") and made a subordinate of Khirirat Nikhom district. On November 14, 1971 it regained full district status.
Symbols.
The slogan of the district is "Beautiful Rafflesia, rich in hills covered by mist".
Administration.
The district is subdivided into 6 subdistricts ("tambon"), which are further subdivided into 56 villages ("muban").

Bodhan

Bodhan is a town of Nizamabad district, Telangana, India. Bodhan is primarily known for the Nizam Sugar Factory and some historical sites.
Bodhan is divided into three areas: Bodhan, Rakasipet and Shakkarnagar.
History.
Bodhan is located in Nizamabad district of Telangana and is about 27 km from Nizamabad town. 
Bodhan is constellated with many ancient constructions and is a commercial and industrial center. A big reservoir called Belal is located here which is natural scenery and attracts tourist. The reservoir was named after the Companion of Prophet Muhammad(SWS), Hazrat Bilal.
Bodhan was previously known as Eka Chakrapuram. Assaka (Sanskrit: अश्मक, Aśmaka Pali: Assaka), was one of ancient Indian regions (700–300 BCE). It is one of the solasa (sixteen) mahajanapadas in the 6th century BCE, mentioned in the Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya. 
The region was located on the banks of the Godavari river, between the rivers Godavari and Manjira. It was the only Mahajanapada situated to the south of the Vindhya Range, and was in Dakshinapatha. It corresponds to districts Nizamabad and parts of Adilabad, Nanded and Yavatmal in current-day India. The capital of Ashmaka was Paudanyapura, the Prakrit name of Bahudhanyapura meaning "city of many grains", identified as present day Bodhan.
The capital is variously called Potali, Potana or Podana, which now lies in the Nandura Tehsil.

Military dummy

Dummies and decoys are fake military equipment that are intended to deceive the enemy. Dummies and decoys are only one aspect of military deception.
Examples.
During World War II, multiple dummy airfields and even towns were used in England to divert German bombers from the real targets. At the Battle of La Ciotat in 1944, American aircraft dropped hundreds of dummy paratroopers (Paradummies) just north of La Ciotat, France. The goal of this operation was to divert German troops away from the main landing zones of Operation Dragoon. Additionally, during World War II, Operation Quicksilver was an attempt to mislead the Germans as to the location of the D-Day invasion using dummy military equipment. 
A naval example was the British battleship HMS "Centurion". Obsolete and disarmed by World War II, she spent two years in the Mediterannean fitted with wooden guns, to make British naval forces in the area seem stronger than they were. Likewise, "Fleet tender" was the codename for a number of British merchant ships that fitted with dummy structures to resemble warships. 
An intercontinental ballistic missile may release decoys in addition to one or more warheads.

Malestan District

Malistan is a district in the west of Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. Its population, which is 100% Hazara, was estimated at 71,784 in 2003. The district capital is Meradina.
History.
During the period of Dost Mohammad Khan in the 1830s the area operated as part of the semi-autonomous area of Hazarajat. In 1949 the area was separated from Jaghori District. During the Soviet Occupation Maoist resistance groups were particularly active. After Harakat lost in Qarabagh of Ghazni in 1985 to Nasr, the Khomeinist organizations united to force out Hizb-e Islami from the districts of Jaghori and Malistan. However there were only sporadic clashses here and the central government lacked interest in Malistan. Around 1997, as the Taliban began to take control of Hazarajat the area was put under food blockade, leaving approximately 1 million Hazaras on the bring of starvation, including those in Malistan.
In 2002, plans were drawn up to split Malistan into four separate districts, in order to increase Hazara political representation; however, these plans are not believed to have been carried through. From 2002-2008 approximately 3,801 refugees repatriated through the UNHCR system, although only 35 were listed as returning in 2008 and the fact majority occurring in 2002-04.
Security.
Reported intimidation has taken place by some armed groups associated with Hizb-i Wahdat which has led to some internal displacement. Members from the Nasr faction were particularly highlighted in this, and they have been accused of abductions, extortion and other crimes. Taliban presence in Ghazni has become a significant problem as well with some sources referring to the area as Taliban controlled. Aside from this the major sources of conflict are related to land and water, while debt- and marriage-related conflict does occur. Land conflicts increased greatly during the period of drought. 
Most importantly, even though the Taliban are said, as of 2008, to have only limited activity in the district, the security situation in other parts of the province has greatly affected the livelihood of the inhabitants, posing serious threats to their life, security and freedom. The districts are inaccessible except through Taliban territory, where the road has reportedly been mined and in some areas vehicles have been banned. According to some reports the road from Qarabagh District to Jaghouri, passing through Malistan is under particular threat, with kidnappings and up to 150 cars having been stolen. There are also concerns that the Taliban will use the Kuchi nomads to exert their influence in the region.
Agriculture and development.
According to information from the United Nations Food Program for Afghanistan in 2003 and the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development in 2007, the main crops in the area are wheat, corn, maize, peas, grapes, almonds, potatoes, onions and herbs.
182 Community Development Committees were reportedly active in Malistan in 2008.
In years following the fall of the Taliban the area has been particularly affected by drought. In combination with frequent attacks along the Kabul-Kandahar Ring Road, this has seriously affected aid and development in the system and exacerbated local conflicts.
Politics.
Past and present major political parties include Muttahed-e Inqelab-e Islami Afghanistan (formed 1981), Hizbullah, Harakat-i Islami, Sazman-e Nasr-e Afghanistan, Pasdaran-e Jihad-e Islami Afghanistan (formed 1983) and Hezb-e Wahdat (Nasr faction), the later controlling the district since 2001-2008, although as of 2009 the Taliban have begun to exert their influence.
The District Governor is Zafar Sharif who has no known affiliation or links to criminal groups. The Police Chief Aqhyee Abassi is affiliated with Nahzat-i Islami.
Demographics.
The average number of people per household is 8. The entire district is primarily Hazara however Kuchi nomades travel through the area in spring and autumn. This has caused significant conflict in 2007-2008 as in other areas of Afghanistan such as Behsud District.
Education.
The Education system doesn't work in Malistan. According to UN 2010 report 80% of the population are illiterate.
Education is not the only major problem in Malistan. .Many people reported lack of Medicines and Health related Issues Thus Malistan Health and Education both rely on Jaghori. Jaghori has helped Malistan in Education and Health. Majority of Malistanis have been green-eyed to Jaghori thus jaghori has always helped.

38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade

The 38th Brigade, now 38 (Irish) Brigade, was organised as a British Army formation during the Second World War. It was composed of Irish battalions and served with distinction in the Tunisian and Italian campaigns.
History.
The original 38th Brigade, formed in 1914, was one of the brigades of 13th (Western) Division, one of the volunteer formations raised as part of Kitchener's Army. It was composed of Lancashire battalions and fought in the Gallipoli and Mesopotamian campaigns. It was disbanded in 1919.
38 Brigade was reformed as 38th (Irish) Brigade on 13 January 1942 by converting the 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a Home Defence formation organised in 1940. 210 Bde had been serving in Dorset County Division. When that division was disbanded on 24 November 1941, 210 Bde transferred to 1st Infantry Division. By then all of 210 Bde's English home defence battalions had been posted away and were being replaced by frontline Irish battalions.
In June 1942 the 38th Brigade transferred to 6th Armoured Division and it landed in North Africa with that formation on 22 November 1942. In March 1943 it joined 78th (Battleaxe) Infantry Division and fought with distinction in the Tunisia Campaign, Sicily (in particular the capture of Centuripe), and Italy as part of this highly regarded division until the end of the Second World War, though during May 1945 it was detached to both 46th Division and 6th Armoured Division. The brigade then was allotted occupation duties in Carinthia in southern Austria, and was eventually formally disbanded in April 1947.
38 (Irish) Brigade reformed on 1 August 2007, as part of a new combined divisional / brigade structure called HQ Northern Ireland and 38 (Irish) Brigade after the disbandment of HQ Northern Ireland and has its Headquarters at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn. 
The Brigade subsequently came under command of the 2nd Division, the regional division for Scotland, the North of England and Northern Ireland, on 1 January 2009. It is now the Regional Brigade responsible for administering the Territorial Army within Northern Ireland.
This was the culmination of a drawdown of military headquarters in Northern Ireland, which had seen the disbandment of 3 Infantry Brigade, 8 Infantry Brigade, 39 Infantry Brigade and 107 (Ulster) Brigade. 
Today the Territorial soldiers from the Brigade have served on operations supporting the Regular Army in the Balkans, on Operation TOSCA in Cyprus, on Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan and Operation TELIC in Iraq. At home the Brigade has the key role of providing the Civil Contingency Reaction Force for Northern Ireland.
Second World War Structure.
With this combination, it therefore had pre-war Regular, Territorial and war-time raised units within its structure.

Hans Wilhelm Frei

Hans Wilhelm Frei (April 29, 1922 – September 12, 1988) was a biblical scholar and theologian who is best known for work on biblical hermeneutics. Frei's work played a major role in the development of postliberal theology (also called narrative theology or the Yale school of theology). His best-known and most influential work is his 1974 book, "The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative" (Yale University Press), which examined the history of eighteenth- and nineteenth century biblical hermeneutics in England and Germany. Frei spent much of his career teaching at Yale Divinity School.
Early life: Europe.
Hans Frei once described his early years as involving a series of 'worlds left behind'. He was born in Breslau, Lower Silesia, Germany, to secularised Jewish parents (Magda Frankfurther Frei, a pediatrician; Wilhelm Siegmund Frei, a venereologist on the medical faculty of the University of Breslau). That Jewish culture did not play a huge part in his upbringing can be seen from the fact that he was baptized into the Lutheran church along with most other members of his class, and from his memory that he was forbidden from using Yiddish phrases at home. His family was reasonably respectable and well-to-do (indeed, they had a distinguished past), and young Hans seems to have spent a good deal of time getting a solid German education and reading widely in the German classics. However, as the atmosphere in Germany soured, he was for his safety sent away from that world - away from Nazi Germany to the Quaker school in Saffron Walden, England, in January 1935.
Although he found the language problem daunting and was sometimes lonely, he found England a welcoming and courteous place, and despite his own isolation and anxiety was struck by the absence in England of the pervasive fear which he thought had been a feature of life in 1930s Germany. Young Frei believed that war was on the way, and wanted to stay where he was in safety.
It was, it seems, whilst at the Friend's school that Frei saw a picture of Jesus and suddenly 'knew that it was true' - a conversion experience of some kind which led him to a form of Christianity which at this stage had nothing to do with attendance at church. Later in his life, even when it ran against the grain of his theology, he still found Quaker meetings more deeply satisfying than his adopted Anglicanism.
Early life: America.
After three years, in August 1938, his parents left Germany, and Frei moved with them to the United States, where he was terrified by his encounter with New York City. It was a difficult time, and Frei had trouble feeling that he belonged. The family were very short of money, and were only able to find him a scholarship to study textile engineering at North Carolina State University (after seeing an advertisement for it in a paper). He gained a B.S. there in 1942. Nevertheless, he took to his adopted country and made it thoroughly his own - so much so that when he went back to Germany for a visit in the 1950s he felt most definitely like a visiting American Professor rather than a German exile returned. In particular, he found a home within America in New Haven, Connecticut, at Yale University.
Turning to theology.
While at North Carolina State, Frei heard a lecture by the prominent theologian H. Richard Niebuhr, began corresponding with him, and eventually enrolled for a B.D. degree at Yale Divinity School, Niebuhr's base. It was there that he found a kind of home. Despite some wanderings in the years between 1945 and 1947 and 1950 and 1956, Frei described YDS as the 'world not left behind'. There he was taught by Niebuhr and by R.L. Calhoun and Julian Hartt, and there some of his deepest theological attitudes were shaped, some of his deepest friendships formed, all his most important work done, and his tremendously successful teaching and administrative duties carried out.
He graduated in 1945, and became a Baptist minister at the First Baptist Church, North Stratford, New Hampshire. Despite the work involved in the parish, in being a local preacher, and in some teaching work, Frei found time to read a great deal in solitude. He found himself drawn towards Anglicanism, towards what he saw as its more obviously 'generous' orthodoxy - to such an extent that in later life he was to say that Baptist ministry had always felt like a staging post on the way to somewhere else. At the same time, he developed a yearning for more academic work.
Frei returned to the graduate school at Yale Divinity School in 1947, and began a lengthy doctoral dissertation under H. Richard Niebuhr, on Karl Barth's early doctrine of Revelation. This was to take until 1956 to complete - but some of that time is explained by the other things Frei was doing. In 1948, on October 9, he married Geraldine Frost Nye. He landed a job as Assistant Professor of Religion at Wabash College, Indiana, in 1950. A son, Thomas, was born in 1952. In 1953 Frei became Associate Professor of Theology at the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest (with some time as Visiting Lecturer in the Southern Methodist University in 1954), and was involved with St. John's Episcopal Church in Crawfordsville, Indiana while teaching at Wabash College. In 1955 a second son, Jonathan, was born. He completed his thesis in 1956 and was promoted to Professor of Theology. A year later, he returned to Yale Divinity School as Assistant Professor of Religious Studies, and, in the same year, his daughter Emily was born.
Between 1958 and 1966 Frei worked away more or less in obscurity. As can be seen from an annotated bibliography, there are very few recorded writings from this period. After the publication of two essays for a festschrift for Niebuhr in 1957 (including extracts from his thesis), and a short article on 'Religion, Natural and Revealed' in a handbook of Christian theology published the following year, there is a great gap. Frei delivered a talk on Feuerbach at the 1965 meeting of the American Academy of Religion, admittedly, but this does not seem to have been particularly central to his work. All the indications are that he had thrown himself into teaching, and into the slow, painstaking research that would eventually emerge as "The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative". In many ways he felt that the stands he had taken in his thesis against prevailing modes of apologetical and anthropocentric theology isolated him (again), made his work a struggle against the tide. He did not have the temperament for the kind of sweeping statements and rabble-rousing clarion calls which might have pulled supporters to his side, and he produced his careful and complex writings only after taking great pains.
It was during this period of obscurity that Frei received a Morse Fellowship and a Fulbright Award for research at the University of Göttingen (1959–60) . A little later, with the help of an American Association of Theological Schools Fellowship and a Yale Senior Faculty Fellowship, Frei spent some time in Cambridge, England (1966-7). His trip back to Germany was clouded by the sense that the recent past had been brushed under an inadequate rug, that it didn't matter, that Germany had re-invented itself rather than dealing with what had taken place. A meeting with Emanuel Hirsch, which was only granted when Frei agreed not to raise the question of Nazism, confirmed Frei's impressions. Frei also spent time in England, which he appears to have enjoyed, and even though he found that nothing much was going on theologically in Cambridge that interested him, he frequently referred back in later life to how much he had enjoyed his time there.
Earlier theological work.
Frei was appointed Associate Professor in 1963. Then, between 1966 and 1968, almost as an interruption to the work which was proceeding towards "Eclipse", Frei produced a 'theological proposal' - a lengthy article, expanded a little later into an adult education course, commented on in a lecture, and accompanied by a contribution to a seminar on the work of Karl Barth, after the latter's death. This 'proposal' emerged to wider scrutiny only some years later, when (in 1975) the adult education course was republished as "The Identity of Jesus Christ". This strange project, an exercise in the rethinking of the structure and bases of Christology and, even though Frei soon developed doubts about various important aspects of it, it sets the tone and the themes for most of the rest of what he went on to say in theology.
After that brief flurry of activity, Frei returned to honing his work on "Eclipse", which was eventually published (to much wider recognition) in 1974. By that time, Frei had been Acting Master of Silliman College, Yale (1970–1971), and Master of Ezra Stiles College (from 1972), the latter a post he was to hold until 1980. The publication of "Eclipse" coincided with Frei's appointment to a full Professorship. Frei then entered another period of comparative silence, although this time it was not in complete obscurity: his name was out, rattling around in theological and historical circles attached to the massive and ground-breaking "Eclipse", with "Identity" as a strange accompaniment. His silence was not so much due to the pressures of teaching or to isolated and exhaustive research, but to his commitment to his job as Master of Ezra Stiles. Frei also served as chair of the council of masters in 1975.
The 1970s were a difficult decade for Frei. He found himself troubled about his links to the church. Firmly convinced theologically that he should have some kind of ecclesiastical grounding and location for his work as well as his academic setting, he nevertheless felt distanced from his adopted Anglican home, and yet committed to stay there. He found himself theologically uneasy about the places where he did feel less isolated - in particular, Quaker meetings. At the same time he found himself unable easily to call himself a theologian, particularly not a systematic theologian, and he concentrated his energies instead on the 'religious studies' (for which read 'historical') side of his work. Nevertheless, the questions he asked, the issues which interested him, the way he pursued that historical work - all were theological, and he knew it. The ambivalence seems not exactly to have haunted him, but at least to have been never far from his working mind.
The major work which Frei completed in this decade (after Eclipse) was all historical. He directed a National Endowment for the Humanities summer seminar in 1976 (his title was 'Modernity as Temptation'), and he delivered various lectures including the Rice Lectures in 1974 (on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Gottfried Herder and Immanuel Kant) and the George F. Thomas Memorial Lectures in 1978 (on Lessing). He also produced a piece of work which he thought of as perhaps his finest: the essay on David Friedrich Strauss which was eventually published in 1985, although Frei finished it in the very early 1980s after having worked on it throughout the last years of the 1970s.
Later theological work.
In the late seventies, Frei's outlook began to shift. He found himself increasingly drawn away from purely intellectual history and towards social history; in tandem he found his doubts about aspects of the "Identity" and "Eclipse" phase of his work crystallising in a shift away from more theoretical hermeneutical solutions towards more social, 'cultural-linguistic' - and, we might say, more ecclesiological and pneumatological - solutions. In the 1978 George F. Thomas Lecture, he issued what can in retrospect be seen as something of a personal manifesto, using the word 'sensibility' to denote the object of a kind of historical study which would look for the shape and development of religious styles, attitudes and doctrines firmly embedded in the development and interaction of social institutions of various overlapping kinds. In 1981, he spent some time in England during which he looked, on advice from Owen Chadwick, at visitation returns and sermons from the eighteenth century life of a couple of English parishes, hoping to find a way to combine the more social and cultural historical insights which these things gave him into the Christianity of the time with the insights he had hitherto gained through a more traditional study of well-known high-culture theologians and philosophers.
From 1982 until 1988, his time as Master over, Frei returned to publishing and writing with a vengeance. Although still not prolific by the standards of many of his contemporaries, by his own standards his output was vast. He returned to both strands of his earlier constructive theological work: hermeneutics (which had been the subject matter of "Eclipse") and Christology (the subject matter of "Identity"). In 1982 he delivered a paper on the interpretation of narrative, at Haverford College; in 1983 the Shaffer Lectures at Yale (in which he began to develop what has subsequently become a famous five-place typology for understanding modern theology) and delivered a long paper on hermeneutics at the University of California. His work did not even flag when he became chair of the Department of Religious Studies from 1983 to 1986. He spoke in 1985 in response to an assessment of his work by the evangelical theologian Carl F. H. Henry; in 1986 he spoke at a conference in honour of Jürgen Moltmann, delivered a lecture at Princeton University, and spoke on Barth and Schleiermacher at a conference at Stony Point, New York. In 1987 he delivered the Cadbury lectures in Birmingham, England, and the Humanities Council lectures at Princeton. He prepared a contribution to Bruce Marshall's festschrift for George Lindbeck, and another for a conference on H. Richard Niebuhr to be held in September 1988.
Most of these papers and lectures were indirectly or directly directed towards one end: a history of the figure of Jesus in popular and high culture in England and Germany since 1750. Frei seems to have found a new theological confidence bubbling up with this historical project, however: now, more than ever, the two sides of his work (which had been the source of his ambivalence in the 1970s) become inextricably linked. One moment he can be talking about the rise of the professions in Germany and the impact that had on theology in the Universities. The next moment he can be talking about the sensus literalis of scripture and theology as Christian self-description. The next moment (although this is not immediately evident from his published work) he can be talking about providence and pilgrimage. It is hard now to gauge exactly what shape the final project would have taken in which all this rich material would have been combined, but it is clear that Frei wished to pursue theological reflection through the medium of detailed historical work, and wished to hone a full-blown Christology of his own - a Christology which would have had a significant political dimension - by paying detailed attention to the ways in which Jesus had been described and redescribed in Western Protestant culture since the Enlightenment.
Death.
The potential project of a comprehensive Christology was, however, never completed. Before he could deliver a paper he had written for a conference on H. Richard Niebuhr, he fell ill, and the paper was given in his absence. Frei died at the peak of his theological and historical career.

Los Angeles Film School

The Los Angeles Film School or "LA Film School" is a for-profit college geared toward the entertainment industry. It offers associate's degrees in Recording Engineering, Computer Animation, Game Production and Film. In 2012, The Los Angeles Film School launched its first Bachelor of Science Degree in Entertainment Business.
In 2010 the school made national headlines due to a class action lawsuit filed against the institution for alleged deceptive practices in over-promising jobs in the entertainment industry, and bribing students to falsify jobs reports to remain accredited. As a result, the school lost its accrediting through the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET).
History.
The Los Angeles Film School began operating September 8, 1999. The school's founding President was noted indie film Producer Caroline Pfeiffer and the founding Dean was Amedeo D'Adamo.
Caroline and Thom left the school two years later just before it went through its first ownership change. In 2001, when the enrollment was 170 students, the School's new sole owners, Paul Kessler and Diana Derycz-Kessler, asked Amedeo D'Adamo to become President of the school. At this point one of the school's investors, Diana Derycz-Kessler — a Harvard Law graduate and corporate legal counsel for Occidental Petroleum's international division — took over as CEO. In 2002, Amedeo D'Adamo amicably resigned his position to begin a production company; he would later be invited back by the Kesslers to be a Visiting Artist at the school. In 2003, the owners of Full Sail Real World Education formed a business partnership with Derycz-Kessler and her husband Paul Kessler, the majority owners of the LAFS and the Los Angeles Recording School. In 2006, Full Sail purchased property for the schools, expanding their total square footage to 230,000 square feet.
The school was accredited to award vocational degrees in 2008. Later that year, the school added computer animation and game production programs. In 2010, the school doubled the size of their student body to more than 1,500 students.
Controversy.
In 2010 the Los Angeles Film School and Los Angeles Recording School were served with a class action lawsuit through Los Angeles Superior Court alleging deceptive practices in attracting students by over-promising jobs in the entertainment industry, and for bribing students into lying about their jobs for the institution to remain accredited. The school alleges that for $23,000/year in tuition, students receive 900 hours of instruction, however students alleged they did not - and the school manipulates their jobs report to maintain accredited through ACCET, later losing their accreditation.
Also in 2010, LA Film School and LA Recording School was sued for multiple employee retaliation.
Academics.
Degree programs.
As of January 2009, The Los Angeles Film School offers associates degrees in Film, Computer Animation, Game Production, Recording Arts. In September 2012, The Los Angeles Film School launched its first Bachelor of Science degree program in Entertainment Business.
Facilities.
In 2000, LAFS opened its digital high-definition, Dolby Surround, THX-Certified theater.
In 2006, Full Sail purchased an additional six-story building at 6353 Sunset Boulevard. In 2007, the school purchased the Ivar Theater located at Ivar and Selma Avenue.
The college now has over of facilities, including over 20 labs, and a Hollywood Set Sound Stage.

United Nations War Crimes Commission

The United Nations War Crimes Commission (initially called the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes) was a commission of the United Nations that investigated allegations of war crimes committed by the Nazi Germany and its allies in World War II.
The Commission began its work at the behest of the British government and the other Allied nations in 1943, prior to the formal establishment of the United Nations itself. The announcement of the establishment of the commission was made by the Lord Chancellor John Simon in the House of Lords on October 7, 1942:
The proposal is to set up with the least possible delay a United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes. The Commission will be composed of nationals of the United Nations, selected by their Governments. The Commission will investigate war crimes committed against nationals of the United Nations recording the testimony available, and the Commission will report from time to time to the Governments of those nations cases in which such crimes appear to have been committed, naming and identifying wherever possible the persons responsible. The Commission should direct its attention in particular to organized atrocities. Atrocities perpetrated by or on the orders of Germany in Occupied France should be included. The investigation should cover war crimes of offenders irrespective of rank, and the aim will be to collect material, supported wherever possible by depositions or by other documents, to establish such crimes, especially where they are systematically perpetrated, and to name and identify those responsible for their perpetration.
A similar statement was issued by the US government.
The Commission had no power to prosecute war criminals by itself: it merely reported back to the government members of the UN. These governments then could convene the tribunals, such as the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
The Commission, which was headed by British Peer Robert Alderson Wright, was dissolved in 1949.
One of its tasks was to carefully collect evidence of war crimes for the arrest and fair trial of alleged Axis criminals.

Silage (band)

Silage was a Christian alternative band formed in the 1990s out of Grass Valley, California. Silage produced two albums, "Watusi" and "Vegas Car Chasers" on Sub•Lime Records and their parent Essential Records, respectively. The band's lineup for "Watusi" consisted of Damian Horne, Lance Black, and Shane Black (brothers). Chuck Cummings joined the band before the release of "Vegas Car Chasers" and stayed on until the eventual demise of the band.
The band was known for their quirky but spiritually relevant lyrics and their constant mix of musical styles.
Release history.
Silage produced a few independent albums before being signed to Sub*Lime Records, including "Holy Cow Food! Bagman!" in 1996 on the Sonfish Records imprint (featuring partial vocals and bass by A-F Records recording artist Ean Elliot), "Liquid Spatula". Silage's first album, "Watusi" (1997) saw a slightly immature blend of ska, punk and hip-hop heralded mostly by the Christian underground punk scene, though songs such as "My Car Makes Me Sin," which is about traffic in Southern California, rose above the general melee. For their next release, Silage modified their sound to bring pop and hip-hop influences to the fore. This new sound produced their more successful album, "Vegas Car Chasers" (1998). The most notable songs from this album are "Billboards," which garnered the No. 6 spot on Christian music charts in 1998; and "Verb," which was graced by the rap stylings of Knowdaverbs, and achieved No. 7 on the same chart the next year.
The Demise of Silage.
In the wake of "Vegas Car Chasers", the buzz and anticipation for Silage was impressive, though it seems the band was not able to survive the hype. Following unrealized rumors of a name change, Silage disbanded in 1999, for undisclosed reasons. While this came as a blow to the increasing fan base of Silage, hope was offered in the form of the band Parkway, also on Essential Records, and consisting of Damian Horne and Lance Black, two members of the former band Silage. While on the surface it seemed that Parkway had all the elements loved in Silage (a guest rapper, KJ-52 on "Need Someone" and even guest vocals from Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine on the successful "Your Love Surrounds Me"), yet the album, "Glad You Made It" and the new band did not fulfill the eager expectations Silage fans brought with them, as reflected in Parkway's short-lived career.
Today, the only surviving vestige of Silage exists in the band Celebrity, fronted by Lance Black. Celebrity has perhaps gained more acclaim than either Silage or Parkway for their indie-emo fashionings.

Richard Tambling

Richard Tambling (born 12 September 1986) is an Australian rules footballer who plays in the Australian Football League.
Early life.
Richard is an Indigenous Australian and his ancestry can be traced to the Woolna, a Northern Territory tribe.
AFL career.
Richmond Tigers.
In the 2004 AFL Draft Tambling was a first round selection, the number four pick overall, and drafted to the Richmond Football Club. Richmond had the opportunity to recruit Lance Franklin, some say this was bad judgement made by the Richmond recruitment personnel. In comparison to Franklin, Tambling's tenure at Richmond has been enigmatic. He had long been considered a dominant player up in the Northern Territory with his explosive speed and ability to read the play; he only confirmed that status throughout the 2004 pre-season. Terry Wallace was particularly impressed, saying he and Deledio were the "best young kids in the country".
2005 and 2006.
He played in 12 games in the 2005 AFL season and a further 21 in the 2006 AFL season.
In the latter stages of 2005, Tambling struggled with injury, including a broken toe and a consistent hamstring problem.
2007.
The speedy youngster came under scrutiny in previous seasons, but showed what he can do when he booted four first-quarter goals against West Coast in round five.
2008.
Tambling has further developed his game in season 2008 and has spent more time in the midfield. While his time on ground may not be big, Tambling has proved a handy midfielder who has the ability to win the contested football and kick goals.
2009–10.
The constant criticism of the underperforming midfielder reached new heights in the round 3 match between the Western Bulldogs and the Richmond Tigers. Tambling's game was viewed by many experts as one of the worst performances of faltering career due to the amount of costly turnovers from his small total of 12 possessions. He received a bronx cheer from the Richmond fans after getting his first kick which also happened to be a turnover. Coach Terry Wallace later explained that Tambling had become a father in the two days earlier, which had affected his sleep before the match. Tambling was dropped from the Richmond team for the following match against the Demons. After a week at Coburg, he returned to the AFL in arguably the best form of his career. Very influential against Sydney, Fremantle, and the West Coast Eagles, he was finally showing the ability that was expected of him with his high draft pick.
Adelaide Crows.
On 6 October 2010 he was traded to the Adelaide Crows for two draft selections, a first round and third round pick. On the 30th October, 2013 after only 16 games, he was delisted.

<doc id="4877595" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877595" title="Proportionality (law)">
Proportionality (law)

Proportionality is a general principle in law which covers several special (although related) concepts. The concept of proportionality is used as a criterion of fairness and justice in statutory interpretation processes, especially in constitutional law, as a logical method intended to assist in discerning the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act. Within criminal law, it is used to convey the idea that the punishment of an offender should fit the crime. Under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, "proportionality" and "distinction" are important factors in assessing military necessity.
History.
The proportionality test was first developed in the High State Administrative Courts ("Oberlandesgericht") in Germany in the late 19th century, to review actions by the police.
The proportionality test originated systematically with the jurisprudence of the German Constitutional Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht.
European Union law.
In European Union law there generally acknowledged to be four stages to a proportionality test, namely,
It is, however, often seen that the third and fourth criterion are often merged into one by the European Court of Justice, depending on the margin of discretion that the Court sees as being afforded to the member state. Examples are found in "R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment", where the ECJ points out that a member state has some discretion in the policies it pursues, surrounding unfair dismissal, in reducing unemployment. Further examples of the proportionality test are seen in "Mangold v Helm" and "Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG".
Criminal law.
In criminal law, the principle of proportional justice is used to describe the idea that the punishment of a certain crime should be in proportion to the severity of the crime itself. In practice, systems of law differ greatly on the application of this principle. In some systems, this was interpreted as "lex talionis", (an eye for an eye). In others, it has led to a more restrictive manner of sentencing. For example, all European Union countries have accepted as a treaty obligation that no crime warrants the death penalty, whereas some other countries in the world do use it.
In self-defense cases, the amount of force employed by the defender must be proportionate to the threatened aggressive force. If deadly force is used to defend against non-deadly force, the harm inflicted by the actor (death or serious bodily harm) will be greater than the harm avoided (less than serious bodily harm). Even if deadly force is proportionate, its use must be necessary. Otherwise, unlawful conduct will only be justified when it involves the lesser harm of two harmful choices. If countering with non-deadly force or with no force at all avoids the threatened harm, defensive use of deadly force is no longer the lesser evil of only two choices. Alternatives involving still less societal harm are available.
In United States Law, the United States Supreme Court proposed the Proportionality Doctrine in three cases during the 1980s, namely "Enmund v. Florida" (1982), "Solem v. Helm" (1983) and "Tison v. Arizona" (1987), to clarify this key principle of proportionality within the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The fundamental principle behind proportionality is that the punishment should fit the crime. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that courts must do three things to decide whether a sentence is proportional to a specific crime:
Proportionality is also present in other areas of municipal law, such as civil procedure. For example, it is embodied in Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C), which considers whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Proportionality is a key consideration in the discovery process, and has been applied to e-discovery, where it has been attributed with significant cost-savings. It is likely that proportionality will be applied to new and developing areas of law, such as the law of legal technology.
International humanitarian law.
The harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a military objective.
Luis Moreno-Ocampo was the Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court who investigated allegations of war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He published an open letter containing his findings; in a section titled "Allegations concerning War Crimes", he elucidates this use of "proportionality":

Ken Miles

Ken Miles (born 1 November 1918 in Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham, England; died 17 August 1966 in Riverside, California, United States) was a sports car racing engineer and driver best known for his career in the USA and with American teams on the international scene.
Career.
Miles raced motorcycles before he served as a tank sergeant in the British Army in World War II.
After the war he raced Bugattis, Alfa Romeos and Alvises with the Vintage Sports Car Club. He then turned to a Ford V8 Frazer-Nash.
Ken then moved from England to the Los Angeles, California area. In 1953 he won 14 straight victories in SCCA racing in an MG-based special of his own design and construction.
For the 1955 season, he designed, constructed and campaigned a second special based on MG components that was known as the "Flying Shingle". It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the "Flying Shingle" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in a MG Special, and novice driver, actor James Dean in a Porsche 356 Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced Johnny von Neumann's Porsche 550 Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events. 
For the 1957 season (in cooperation with Otto Zipper), Ken engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 Cooper chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as "the Pooper", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by Pete Lovely of Tacoma, WA. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.
Because of his great skill and talent both as a driver and as a mechanic and engineer, Miles was a key member of the Shelby/Cobra race team in the early 1960s. He was affectionately known by his American racing crew as "Teddy Teabag" (for his tea drinking) or "Sidebite" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth.)
In 1966 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona (pictured) with Lloyd Ruby, and the 12 Hours of Sebring in the Ford GT Mk.II. Miles was leading at the end of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Ford management, desiring a publicity photo of the three Mk.IIs crossing the finish line together, ordered him to slow down to cross the line together with the second place car, driven by Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon. However, the scoring system at Le Mans takes into account the differing distances covered by the cars due to differing positions on the starting grid, and so the McLaren-Amon car, having started further back, would, in the event of a dead-heat, have been the official winner. Bitter at this perceived slight by his employers, after his considerable commitment to the Ford racing programme, Miles issued a form of protest by slowing to allow McLaren ahead to win. Miles was thus denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.
Test driver/car developer.
His early career got Carroll Shelby's attention, who hired Miles as a test driver in the early 1960s. Miles helped Shelby develop the Shelby Cobra. He also is credited with helping Shelby develop the GT40 and the Mustang GT350.
Death.
The Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the all-conquering Ford GT Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. The dark spot that came of the springtime trials was the death of Walt Hansgen in a Mk.II. Ford management made the decision to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with Kammback aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproven with high-speed prototype sports cars.
After most of a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's , downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were heavily modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the programme in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car. The significantly revised car, renamed the Ford Mk IV, won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of Mario Andretti, who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped with minor injuries.

James Heane

James Heane CB, CMG, DSO (29 December 1874 – 20 August 1954) was an Australian Army colonel and temporary brigadier general in World War I. He retired in 1935 as a brigadier general.
Early life and career.
James Heane was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 29 December 1874. He was educated at Dubbo Superior Public School and Sydney Boys High School. He became a certified auditor and then a farmer in the Dubbo district.
Heane was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Australian Infantry Regiment. in February 1899. In 1903 he joined the 2nd Light Horse Regiment as a lieutenant. In 1910, with the introduction of compulsory military training, he was appointed area officer in Dubbo. He was promoted to captain on 22 June 1911.
World War I.
On 3 September 1914, Heane was appointed to the First Australian Imperial Force with the rank of captain as a company commander in the 4th Infantry Battalion. After the battalion was reorganised in Egypt, Heane was given command of D Company and promoted to major.
Heane went ashore at Anzac late in the morning of 25 April 1915 and formed Major General Bridges last reserve until it was committed to the fighting at Lone Pine late in the afternoon. Heane earned the nickname "Cast Iron Jimmy" for his gallantry under fire in the fighting at Lone Pine on the 26th, when the 4th Battalion moved across the 400 Plateau and occupied Johnson's Jolly for a time, Heane returning from there after dark. On 1 May, Heane led a company forward under fire to support a small force. for this he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Mentioned in Despatches. He was wounded three times: in the thumb on 2 July; in the mouth; and then in the attack on Lone Pine on 7 August 1915. He was wounded so badly at Lone Pine that he was evacuated and hospitalised finally rejoining his battalion at Tel el Kebir, Egypt, in January 1916.
Heane was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 1st Infantry Battalion, which he took to the Western Front. On 23 July 1916, the battalion was committed to the line at Pozieres, advancing through the town itself. Afterwards, Heane personally walked the whole front and carefully thinned out the line so that the minimum number of men would be exposed to the enemy artillery when it discovered their location. In the fighting, the 1st Battalion lost 13 officers and 473 other ranks, about half its strength. For his leadership at Pozieres, Heane was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.
During 1916, Heane had been acting commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade twice. On 3 December 1916, he was promoted to full colonel and temporary brigadier general and given command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. But on 7 December, after going up to the front line and crossing several empty and apparently unused saps that were little more than ditches half filled with muddy slime, Heane found himself in a trench occupied by German soldiers. Realising that he had made a grave mistake, Heane headed for the Australian lines but was wounded in the head before he reached it. He was evacuated to England.
Heane rejoined his unit in January 1917, and led in his brigade the Battles of Bullecourt, Menin Road, Broodeseinde, Passchendaele, Lys, Lihons and Chuignes. For his services in command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Heane was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and Mentioned in Despatches five more times.
Post war.
In March 1919, Heane took over the 1st Division Demobilisation Group at Tidworth, England. He returned to Australia where his appointment to the AIF ended on 7 January 1920. In July 1920 he took over command of the 11th Infantry Brigade. From April 1921 to June 1926 he commanded the 5th Infantry Brigade. He was also honorary colonel of the 4th Battalion from 1926 until he was transferred to the retired list as an honorary brigadier general in 1935. During World War II he was commander of the Volunteer Defence Corps in New South Wales from 1940 to 1942.
Heane settled on a large citrus orchard in West Pennant Hills, New South Wales. From 1922 to 1941 he was also president of the Fruitgrowers' Federation of New South Wales. He died on 20 August 1954 and was cremated.

Dullatur

Dullatur is a village (population 520 (2004)) within the vicinity of Cumbernauld, Scotland. Its name is anglicised from the Gaelic "Dubh Leitir", which means dark slope. The route of the Antonine Wall passes just to the north of Dullatur, and a Roman camp was sited on the line of the wall at nearby Croy Hill.
The development of the village owed much to the creation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, with a station sited in Dullatur in 1842 to encourage commuters to settle there. Several grand villas were built as part of the original development, two of which were designed by the celebrated architect Alexander "Greek" Thomson.
The make up of the village was of the higher socio-economic class, and early recreational developments included golf and lawn-tennis clubs, both of which persist to the present day. The train station is now closed but the village still serves as a commuter settlement, with a number of new private properties having been built there in recent years.

Phil Barnes

Philip Kenneth "Phil" Barnes (born 2 March 1979 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Conference North side Harrogate Town.
Having started his professional career with Rotherham United in 1996, he first made a name for himself as Blackpool's first choice goalkeeper from 1997 to 2004. He notched up 141 league appearances during his spell with the club which earned him a move to Sheffield United. Despite being primarily used as back-up to Paddy Kenny, Barnes was part of the United squad that earned promotion to the Premier League in 2006. Before this he had also spent time on loan with both Torquay United and Queens Park Rangers. Following The Blades promotion, Barnes signed with Grimsby Town where he remained for two years and was the Suppoters Player of the Season for the 2007–08 season. Following a change in management and a drop in Grimsby's fortunes he was released a few weeks from the end of the following season and joined Conference North side Gainsborough Trinity for the final day of the season. In the summer he signed for Trinity on a permanent contract and remained with The Blues for two seasons before joining up with Alfreton Town in the summer of 2012. After a year with Alfreton, Barnes re-signed with Gainsborough.
Club career.
Rotherham United.
Barnes started his playing career with Rotherham United, making his debut against York City in April 1997. He made two appearances for Rotherham in total.
Blackpool.
Barnes then made a move to Blackpool in August 1997 for a fee of £100,000, as cover for Steve Banks, but eventually made the position his own. Following Blackpool's relegation to Division Three in May 2000, Barnes signed a three-year contract keeping him at the club until the end of the 2002–03 season. He contributed a number of clean sheets to the Bloomfield Road club's promotion campaign, helping them to promotion to Division Two via the play-offs in May 2001. After losing his place in the first team, Barnes requested a transfer in November 2003. Having made 170 appearances in all competitions for Blackpool he left the club.
Sheffield United.
He then joined Sheffield United on a free transfer in July 2004, signing a one-year contract, as cover for Paddy Kenny. A regular for the reserves but making just five first-team appearances, he also went out on loan spells at Torquay United and Queens Park Rangers. Barnes was part of the United squad that earned promotion to the Premier League in the 2005–06 campaign.
Grimsby Town.
In June 2006, Barnes signed a three-year contract with Grimsby Town for an undisclosed fee, to replace Steve Mildenhall after his transfer to Yeovil Town. He was named the Grimsby Supporters' Player of the Year for 2007–08. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Barnes had made over 100 appearances in all competitions for Grimsby. Barnes started the 2008–09 season by being in the League Two Team of the Week, then he was in the team of the week again for his performance against Shrewsbury Town. Later in the season after getting a throat infection Mariners boss Mike Newell was forced to replace Barnes, and in turn swooped to sign on loan Preston North End keeper Wayne Henderson to replace him. Barnes was then made available for loan, and on 24 March, Newell rejected a loan move from Shrewsbury Town for him after the two clubs could not agree on a deal regarding wages. On 25 March, Barnes left Grimsby after being told he was no longer needed by the club, his understudy Gary Montgomery was also released. The Mariners saw out the 2008–09 campaign with Henderson and former Leeds United player Jonny Lund, as the clubs two professional keepers.
Gainsborough Trinity.

Trinity managed Steve Charles praised Barnes as he was given Man of the Match in the game, but commented signing Phil for the 2009–10 season was unlikely due to the players desire to play at a professional level. Despite this though, Barnes signed a permanent contract for the club on 9 June 2009 as well as the club signing Darryn Stamp on the same day. Barnes was joined at Trinity by a vast number of professionals as new chairman Peter Swann boosted the clubs finances to sign a higher calibre of players.

Sydney Herring

Brigadier General Sydney Charles Edgar Herring CMG, DSO, VD (8 October 1881 – 27 May 1951) was an Australian Army colonel and temporary Brigadier General in World War I. He retired in 1946 as an honorary brigadier general.
Early life and career.
Sydney Charles Edgar Herring was born in Gladesville, a suburb of Sydney on 8 October 1881. After a public school education he became a real estate agent.
Herring was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 1st Australian Infantry Battalion on 26 March 1904 and promoted to lieutenant on 1 March 1906. With the introduction of universal military training in 1911 he became area officer for Drummoyne and was promoted to captain on 4 January 1911, he transferred to the 21st Infantry on 1 July 1912.
World War I.
Herring was appointed to the First Australian Imperial Force on 4 October 1914 with the rank of captain in the 13th Infantry Battalion. The battalion left Sydney on 22 December 1914 for Egypt, where Herring was promoted to major and given command of 'D' Company on 1 February 1915. The 13th Battalion landed at Anzac Cove on the evening of 25 April 1915. Ordered to take his company up to Russell's Top and link up with the New Zealanders, Herring and his men climbed the thick scrub opposite Pope's Hill. After taking heavy casualties Herring decided to pull back his line a bit. By the end of the action Herring had retreated back into Monash Valley.
When the Turks broke through the line into Quinn's Post on 29 May 1915, the temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel Pope, ordered Herring to make a counterattack, which he fully expected would be extremely costly. Just as Herring was about to order the charge, there was a sudden burst of enemy fire, which abruptly almost ceased. Herring gave the word and his men charged across the open and made it practically unscathed, their attack having coincided with a Turkish assault further down the line and in a location where the Turkish machine gunners could not fire without hitting their own men. The remaining Turks in the post eventually surrendered.
Herring was slightly wounded on 17 May 1915 but remained on duty. On 27 June 1915, he assumed acting command of the 13th Infantry Battalion after the battalion commander, Major Durrant was evacuated sick. Herring was confirmed as commander on 26 August 1915. On 15 October 1915, he was evacuated to Egypt sick, returning to his unit at Anzac on 19 November 1915. For his services at Anzac, Herring was mentioned in dispatches.
On 3 January 1916, Herring arrived in Alexandria with the 13th Battalion following the evacuation of Anzac. On 21 February 1916, the battalion was split, half going to form the new 45th Infantry Battalion. Herring took command of the new battalion, while Durrant resumed command of the old. Unfortunately, the new battalions soon had to absorb large numbers of men unwanted by the old battalions and left behind when they moved to France. On 12 March 1916, he became a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to the rank on 24 June 1916.
The 45th Battalion departed Alexandria on 2 June 1916, arriving at Marseilles on 8 June. In August, the battalion was committed to the fighting at Pozieres, losing 448 men on its first tour. For his leadership at Pozieres, Herring was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). At Messines in June 1917, the battalion lost 568 men in pillbox fighting on the Oosttaverne Line. Herring, who had ordered repeated attacks on pillboxes that his men could not capture, was again mentioned in dispatches. On 24 September 1917 he became a brevet major in the AMF.
On 7 October 1917, Herring took over command of the 4th Training Group in England. This group was responsible for training the brigade's reinforcements. The group was abolished on 8 November 1917. On 11 February 1918, Herring took command of the 3rd Training Brigade. On 7 May 1918, he returned to France where he resumed command of the 45th Battalion. On 26 June 1918 he became commander of the 13th Infantry Brigade and was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general on 30 June 1918. The brigade played an important part in the final campaign under his leadership. He was mentioned in dispatches for the fourth time and made a Companion of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 3 June 1919.
Post war.
Herring resumed his career as real estate agent, and ran unsuccessfully for the Senate as a Nationalist in 1924. He was placed on the retired list in 1946 with the honorary rank of brigadier general. For many years he led the 4th Division in Sydney's Anzac Day parades. He died on 27 May 1951 and was cremated with full military honours.

David Heilpern

David Heilpern is an Australian lawyer and author. After attending school in Sydney, and university in Sydney, Canberra and Lismore, New South Wales, Heilpern became a solicitor and barrister. He is the author of "For Fear of Favour: Sexual Assault of Young Prisoners", a prominent study of sexual assault in prisons, and has been an advocate of prison and law reform. In 1998 he became one of the youngest Magistrates in New South Wales. In 2004 he was awarded Southern Cross University's Alumnus of the Decade Award.
Early life and education.
Heilpern is the son of former Byron Shire Councillor, Sandra Heilpern. He initially attended Lane Cove Public School in Sydney, but his parents became concerned when the "school suggested that I needed to conform more, and told my parents that my rebellion was so regular that I needed to see a psychiatrist". He transferred to nearby independent democratic school Currambena in 1970. Recounting his memory of the alternative education he received there, he remarked:Currambena was a revolution for me. I was asked questions about what I wanted to do each day. I learnt because I wanted to learn...The lessons of Currambena stayed with me as I did well at school, became a criminal lawyer, then the youngest head of a law school, then the youngest Magistrate in New South Wales...I can honestly attribute much of my success to my years at Currambena, for it gave me a love of learning that seems so rare these days, especially among boys.
Heilpern studied law in Sydney and Canberra, and undertook postgraduate study at Southern Cross University, completing a Masters of Law by Research in 1998. In 2004, he was the joint recipient of that university's Alumnus of the Decade Award.
Career.
Heilpern became a solicitor and barrister with the Australian Government Solicitor and in private practice, specialising in criminal law. Working on the New South Wales north coast, he was one of a group who prompted the establishment of a law degree at Southern Cross University, and he taught in the program, becoming the Deputy Head of School. In 1998, or early 1999, he became one of the youngest Magistrates in New South Wales. 
As a young barrister, Heilpern rose to prominence following the publication of a study of sexual assault amongst young men in prisons. Heilpern interviewed 300 prisoners aged between 18 and 25, finding that around half reported experiencing assault in jail, with about a quarter being sexually assaulted. Australian High Court justice, Michael Kirby praised Heilpern's book, pointing out that while it made for unpleasant reading, it raised urgent issues of public policy. He also praised it for giving prisoners voice in their own words, saying that most of the statements recorded by Heilpern "have the ring of truth". The book received international notice, including in the US Congress, where it was "the only book included in submissions for what was to become a bipartisan, unanimous bill in both houses to reduce prison rape".
Much of Heilpern's work has been as an advocate for, and defender of, disadvantaged groups. In an article in the "Alternative Law Journal", he wrote praising the work of single mothers in seeking to keep children, particularly young men, out of trouble with the law and criticising the lack of resources available to them. In 1999, Heilpern was Dubbo Local Court magistrate when a case of a young Indigenous man came before the court, charged with using offensive language to a police officer, having told two officers to "fuck off" when they sought to take into custody a bicycle he was riding. Heilpern threw out the police case, in a decision that had implications for the treatment of offensive language by the courts, as well as highlighting the extent to which the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody were not being implemented in such examples. Of his on career and life, he has said he has been part of the prison reform, drug law reform and environment movements.
Ten years after conducting his study on prisoner sexual assault, he argued that conditions in prisons continued to deteriorate, and argued for the protection of prisoners' rights.
In 2006 he presided over the bail hearing of a high-profile assault case involving a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Heilpern is the author of over twenty journal articles and four books.

In June 1995, the ARC set up a taskforce to prevent the Torry Food Science Laboratory being relocated from Aberdeen to York. In July of that year, the taskforce (headed by Hugh Pennington) presented its proposals to Douglas Hogg, the Secretary of State for Agriculture. Hogg confirmed that the laboratory would close in 1996, but an announcement "on the consequential changes for the work currently undertaken by the laboratory" would be made shortly thereafter. The following October, it was announced that the ARC's argument that "Torry site's work could be retained in Aberdeen without the need for extra funds" was accepted in part by Hogg, and that the scientific posts will be distributed equally between York and Aberdeen.

Daniel Sturridge

Daniel Andre Sturridge (born 1 September 1989) is an English footballer who plays for Liverpool and the England national team as a striker.
Born in Birmingham, Sturridge spent four years in the Aston Villa academy before moving to Coventry City. He then signed for Manchester City in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two FA Youth Cup finals. He made his first team debut in the 2007–08 season, becoming the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 and signed for Chelsea, where he was loaned out to Bolton Wanderers for the second half of the 2010–11 season. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the 2011–12 season. He left Chelsea to join Liverpool in January 2013.
Sturridge has represented England at all levels. He made 15 appearances and scored four goals for the Under-21 team. He made his debut for England against Sweden on 15 November 2011 and was selected for the 2012 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Youth career.
Born in Birmingham, Sturridge began his playing career at the age of 6 at local club Cadbury Athletic, before being spotted at the age of seven by the youth academy of Aston Villa. He left Villa four years later to move to Coventry City, from where he joined Manchester City's Academy in 2003, aged 13. A Football League committee later ordered Manchester City to pay Coventry £30,000 compensation, with further payments up to a maximum of £200,000 based upon appearances and international honours. The following year, he was the leading scorer and voted player of the season (the only other person to achieve this was Argentine footballer Carlos Tevez) as City won the Nike Cup, the world's largest under-15 tournament. At 16, he played for Manchester City Youth during their 2006 FA Youth Cup run. The youngest player in the side, he scored four goals en route to the final, and another two in the final, though they were insufficient to prevent a 3–2 aggregate defeat to Liverpool. That summer, he signed his first professional contract, which came into effect when he turned 17.
Manchester City.
From the start of the 2006–07 season, Sturridge began to train with the City first team. A hat-trick in a reserve match was rewarded by a place on the substitutes' bench for the senior side's match with Reading in February 2007. He duly made his debut from the bench, replacing Georgios Samaras for the final quarter-hour. He made a second substitute appearance a month later, but then suffered a hip injury which sidelined him for the remainder of 2007.
He scored his first goal for City on 27 January 2008 in an FA Cup match against Sheffield United, followed three days later by his first league goal on his full debut, against Derby County. However, first team opportunities were sporadic, so Sturridge continued to play for the youth team in the FA Youth Cup. City again reached the final, with Sturridge the leading scorer in the competition. This time City won the final, with Sturridge scoring in the first leg. In the 2007–08 season, Sturridge became the only player ever to score in the Youth FA Cup, the FA Cup and the Premier League in the same season.
As of 1 May 2009, after 16 appearances in the 2008–09 Premier League season, Sturridge had scored four goals and provided three assists. At the end of the 2008–09 season, the Manchester City fans voted Sturridge as the Manchester City Young Player of the Season, in which he dedicated the award to his family and his uncle Dean.
Chelsea.
With Sturridge's contract at Manchester City expired, he signed for Chelsea on a four-year contract on 3 July 2009. As Sturridge was under the age of 24, and the two sides were unable to agree a deal, the fee for Sturridge was decided by a tribunal. The Professional Football Compensation Committee decided on 14 January 2010 that Chelsea would pay an initial fee of £3.5 million, with additional payments of £500,000 after each of 10, 20, 30 and 40 first-team competitive appearances. There would also be a further payment of £1 million if Sturridge made a full international appearance, and Manchester City in addition would receive 15 percent of any sell-on fee if Sturridge was transferred.
2009–10 season.
His first goal for Chelsea was on his debut, a friendly match against Seattle Sounders on 18 July 2009, in the twelfth minute of the match he scored the first goal. Chelsea won the match 2–0. Sturridge played his second game for Chelsea against former Chelsea manager José Mourinho's Inter Milan, during which he won a penalty that player Frank Lampard scored from. He made his Premier League debut for Chelsea on 18 August 2009 against Sunderland, coming on for Didier Drogba. On 16 September 2009, Sturridge scored a hat-trick in a reserve game against Ipswich Town. On 28 October 2009, he made his first start for the club in a League Cup win against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge.
On 20 December, Sturridge came on as a substitute at half time against West Ham United and won Chelsea a controversial penalty which Lampard converted. He made his first start in the Premier League for Chelsea away against Birmingham City on Boxing Day. He scored his first two goals for Chelsea against Watford in the FA Cup third round on 3 January 2010.
He continued to show his ability with a real poachers effort in a 2–0 victory in the FA Cup against Preston North End, scoring his third goal for Chelsea in January. On 13 February 2010, he netted again against Cardiff City, as Chelsea won 4–1. Sturridge scored his first League goal for Chelsea on 25 April 2010, in a 7–0 victory over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge, by latching onto a through ball, before rounding the goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic, and slotting the ball home. During the 2010 FA Cup Final he came on as a 90th minute substitute for Chelsea, as they won 1–0 against Portsmouth. Sturridge finished the 2009–10 FA Cup campaign as the leading scorer for Chelsea with four goals.
2010–11 season.
On 15 September 2010 Sturridge made his full UEFA Champions League debut against Slovakian side MŠK Žilina. He scored on his debut (thus his first UEFA Champions League goal) in a 4–1 away victory. In the Premier League, in a 1–0 loss to his former club Manchester City, Sturridge came on as a substitute for striker Didier Drogba.
He scored his second goal in the Champions League against Žilina, which Chelsea went on to win 2–1. Later on that season he scored two right footed goals against Ipswich Town
Bolton Wanderers (loan).
On 31 January 2011, Sturridge agreed to join Bolton Wanderers on a loan deal until the end of the season. He made his debut two days later, coming on as a substitute at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring his first goal in the process, an injury time winner. He followed this with another goal in the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur the following weekend, in which he made his first start, before scoring his third goal in three games in the 2–0 victory over Everton. When Sturridge scored the equaliser against Newcastle United in his fourth game, he became only the sixth player to score in his first four games for a club in the Premier League. Sturridge continued to make an impact at Bolton and finished his loan spell with 8 goals in 12 appearances at the club. Having never been booked in his career, Sturridge received his first ever red card in the final game of the season against former club Manchester City.
2011–12 season.
The pre-season prior to the start of the 2011–12 season, Sturridge was given chances to prove himself by new manager André Villas-Boas and impressed, scoring a solo effort against Hong Kong club Kitchee SC and then scoring a brace against Scottish team Rangers.
Having received a red card in his final game for Bolton, Sturridge was suspended for the first three competitive matches in the 2011–12 season for Chelsea. Despite rumors linking him with a move away on deadline day, Sturridge remained in West London with strong support from Villas-Boas who said, "He would have been playing if he was not suspended from last season." In his first match back from suspension, at Sunderland, Sturridge started and scored with a back-heel in the 50th minute to put Chelsea up 2–0. Chelsea went on to win the match 2–1. Sturridge returned to the Reebok Stadium on 2 October 2011. He scored twice within the first 30 minutes, the first a header after 90 seconds from a corner and the second a long shot from outside the box, which the goal keeper Ádám Bogdán made an error of saving. He also made an assist to Frank Lampard's goal in the 15th minute of the match, which ended 5–1. On 15 October 2011, he scored against Everton in a 3–1 win, giving him four league goals in four games. Sturridge came on as a substitute in the League Cup match against Everton on the 90 minute, in which he scored a 116th minute winner, which saw Chelsea win 2–1 in extra time, to put them in the last eight. Sturridge scored his seventh goal in the Premier League season, in a 3–0 victory for Chelsea against Newcastle. On 13 December 2011, during the fixture against Sturridge former club Manchester City at Stamford Bridge, Sturridge provided an assist for Raul Meireles goal in the 34th minute. The match ended a 2–1 victory, when Frank Lampard scored a late penalty after Joleon Lescott handled Sturridge's shot in the penalty area. Sturridge scored in the away 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic. He controlled Ashley Cole's diagonal long ball with his left foot, then scored with his right from a tight angle to give Chelsea the lead in the 59th minute. On 22 December 2011, during Chelsea's away clash with Tottenham Hotspur, he scored his 9th goal in the Premier League 2011–12 season, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at White Hart Lane.
Sturridge scored his side's first goal in a 4–2 win against Aston Villa. Sturridge scored the opener in fantastic style after 45 seconds with his 11th Premier League goal of the season against local rivals QPR on 29 April, which Chelsea ran out 6–1 winners to keep Champions League qualification alive. He was an unused substitute as Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final.
2012–13 season.
Sturridge missed all of Chelsea's pre-season games as he was on duty with Great Britain in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He did play against Manchester City in the 2012 FA Community Shield, assisting Ryan Bertrand's goal, by shooting and Costel Pantilimon spilling it. Sturridge missed the first 2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage games against Juventus and Nordsjælland and the first League Cup game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He also missed the Premier League game against Stoke City with a hamstring injury. He scored the last Premier League goal for the club in the 4–2 win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, after coming on as a late substitute and scoring from Juan Mata's cross in stoppage time to seal victory. His last goal for Chelsea was against Manchester United in the League Cup, scoring in extra time in the 5–4 win. After Roberto Di Matteo was sacked as manager and replaced by Rafa Benitez, Sturridge was never to play for the club again due to injury.
Liverpool.
On 2 January 2013, Sturridge completed a move from Chelsea to Liverpool, signing a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £12 million.
2012–13 season.
Sturridge made his Liverpool debut on 6 January against Mansfield Town in the FA Cup third round, scoring his first Liverpool goal after just 7 minutes in a game which Liverpool won 2–1. He scored on his league debut after coming on as a half-time substitute the following weekend, scoring in a 2–1 defeat against rivals and league leaders Manchester United at Old Trafford on 13 January. Sturridge scored his third goal for Liverpool in his first league start and home debut for the club, a 5–0 win against Norwich City at Anfield on 19 January, meaning he had scored three goals in his first three appearances for the club, becoming the first Liverpool player since Ray Kennedy in 1974 to accomplish this feat, despite not yet playing a full game for the club. On 3 February, Sturridge scored a goal from 25 yards-out against former club Manchester City in a 2–2 draw at the Etihad Stadium. Sturridge continued this run of form on 17 February, with an assist for team-mate Jose Enrique, as well as scoring a penalty against Swansea in a 5–0 rout, having missed the prior two games due to a combination of ineligibility and injury. He also scored against Chelsea in a 2–2 draw at Anfield, the match of teammate Luis Suarez's biting incident which led to a 10-match ban for Suarez.
Sturridge scored two goals and notched an assist in a 6–0 thrashing of Newcastle United on April 27 at St James' Park. On 12 May, he scored his first career hat-trick, in a 3–1 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage.
2013–14 season.
Sturridge began the 2013–14 season by scoring the very first goal of the season, which also turned out to be the only goal in Liverpool's 1–0 win over Stoke City, with a shot from outside the box. He then followed this up with a goal against Aston Villa in another 1–0 win and a brace against Notts County in the League Cup, taking his season's tally to four goals in three games. He continued his fine form by scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win against fierce rivals and defending champions Manchester United on his 24th birthday at Anfield, and giving a man of the match performance in a 3–1 win away at Sunderland by scoring and providing two assists for Luis Suárez. These performances earned Sturridge the season's first Premier League Player of the Month award for the month of August. On 23 November, he came off the bench to score a last-minute equaliser against Everton, in a thrilling Merseyside derby that finished 3–3.
Sturridge's impressive goalscoring form continued into the new year, with Sturridge becoming the first Liverpool player in the Premier League era to score in seven consecutive league games when he found the net at Craven Cottage against Fulham. He went on to become only the second player in Premier League history to score in eight games in a row with a brace against Swansea City in a 4–3 win. He was then named 'Player of the Month' for the second time in the season, due to his performances in February in which he scored five goals and earned two assists.
On 18 April, he was named as one of the six players on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year award. He was also nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award. On 27 April 2014, he was named alongside teammates Steven Gerrard and Luis Suárez in the PFA Team of the Year. Sturridge's haul of 21 league goals made him the runner-up in the season's Premier League Golden Boot, behind strike partner Suárez.
International career.
Youth level.
Sturridge has represented England at U16, U17, U18, U19, U20 and U21 levels. He scored twice against the Netherlands for the Under 18 side in 2007, netting again in the Under-19 European Championships against the Netherlands. He scored the only goal for England U21 in a 1–1 draw against Greece U-21 in Greece and scored his second U-21 goal in the 1–0 win over Portugal. He was named in the England U21 squad for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.
Senior level.
On 6 November 2011, Sturridge was handed his maiden England call-up by being named in the England squad for the friendlies against Spain and Sweden, after excelling for Chelsea. He was an unused substitute in a 1–0 victory against Spain, but Fabio Capello insisted that Sturridge would play against Sweden the following Tuesday and did, as he made his debut coming on as a second-half substitute for Theo Walcott. He made his second appearance against the Netherlands coming on in the first half for the injured Steven Gerrard and caused the Dutch defence problems throughout the match and earned the man of the match award for his efforts during the game. 
He scored his first senior goal for England in his fifth match on 22 March 2013, after coming on for Wayne Rooney in an 8–0 away win against San Marino in World Cup qualification. The goal meant that has now made an appearance and scored for all levels of international football for England, from U16 to the seniors, as well as scoring for the Great Britain Olympic football team. On 11 October he scored another goal in England's qualification campaign, an injury-time penalty in a 4–1 win over Montenegro after he had been fouled by Ivan Kecojević.
London 2012 Olympics.
On 2 July 2012, Sturridge was named in Stuart Pearce's 18-man squad for the Great Britain Olympic football team to compete at the London 2012 Olympics. It was however, announced on 3 July 2012 that Sturridge was undergoing tests for suspected meningitis, and was possibly going to be unable to compete in the GB 2012 team. However, he made a full recovery meaning he could take part and he scored his first goal for Great Britain in the second group match, a 3–1 victory over the UAE. In the final group match, Sturridge scored the only goal as Great Britain defeated Uruguay to finish top of their group and progress to the quarter-finals. In the quarter-final match against South Korea, Sturridge missed the fifth penalty for Great Britain. South Korea then scored theirs, knocking out Team GB.
2014 FIFA World Cup.
In May 2014, Sturridge was named in England's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and assigned the number 9 shirt. He scored the team's opening goal in a 3–0 friendly defeat of Peru at Wembley Stadium on 30 May.
On 14 June, Sturridge started England's opening match of the tournament and scored the team's goal in a 2–1 defeat by Italy in Manaus.
Style of play.
Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said, “Daniel offers a few of the characteristics I had with Hulk when I was with him in Porto... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace."
Sturridge said he preferred to play as a centre-forward rather than as a wide player. "I do still see myself as a striker but I am doing a job for the team and I'm enjoying doing it". As Sturridge transitioned from a wider role into a striker when he joined Liverpool, Sturridge also said that he likens himself on striker Thierry Henry who, "played wide for Juventus and then went to Arsenal and played as a centre-forward."
Although he rarely played for Chelsea as a striker, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has played Sturridge as a striker in most games. His ability to still drop between lines and pull wide and attack defences, similar to strike partner Suárez's playing style, has led to Rodgers describing him as, "what I call a 'nine-and-a-half", alluding to how his style of play is somewhere between a classic 'no.9' and a 'no.10'.
Personal life.
Sturridge is a Christian. After winning the Barclays Player of the Month award, Sturridge said, "I do all Christ who strengthens me."
Sturridge is actively involved in charity work, often helping young players get involved in football. In 2012, while playing for Chelsea, he presented a cheque of €50,000 to Street League, a charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged players across Europe get into football. In summer 2013, Sturridge opened his charity foundation named after him in Portmore, Jamaica, with its aim to help youngsters there get into sport.

University of Michigan School of Information

The School of Information (SI) or iSchool at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is a graduate school offering both a Master of Science in Information (MSI) and a Doctor of Information (Ph.D.). 
Its field of study is information: how it is created, identified, collected, structured, managed, preserved, accessed, processed, and presented; how it is used in different environments, with different technologies, and over time. The school's stated mission is: "We create and share knowledge so that people can use information -- with technology -- to build a better world. " Its slogan is "connecting people, information, and technology in more valuable ways."
The School of Information is part of a growing list of i-schools devoted to the study of information as a discipline. These institutions have varied histories, some being newly created, others developing from earlier schools or departments focused on library and information science (as with SI), computer science, communications, or information technology. SI was the first of these institutions to relabel itself as a "school of information." It is currently housed in the North Quadrangle on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus.
In 2008, the School of Information, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the College of Engineering unveiled a new undergraduate major called Informatics. In 2011, the School of Information and the School of Public Health announced the creation of a master's degree in health informatics. In 2012, the School of Information announced plans to offer a bachelor's degree in Information with formal enrollment beginning in 2014.
Undergraduate degree.
Currently, the University of Michigan offers a bachelor's degree in Informatics. Launched in 2008, Informatics is housed in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in cooperation with the College of Engineering and the School of Information. Informatics gives students a solid grounding in information systems, statistics, mathematics and computer programming. Students are able to specialize in one of five tracks: Social Computing (to be phased out in 2013), Data Mining & Information Analysis, Computational (to be phased out in 2013), Internet, and Life Sciences. Depending on the track chosen, students are prepared for many career paths, including business, research, government, computer programming, education and non-profit organizations. 
Starting in 2014, the School of Information will begin offering an undergraduate degree. Students pursuing this will graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Information (BSI). This interdisciplinary degree will focus on the social/behavioral and technological sciences. Students will takes classes in mathematics, communications, statistics and history
Master's degree.
The Master of Science in Information (MSI) degree is a 48-credit hour professional degree built on a core curriculum of "foundations" courses that synthesize content and methodology from library and information science, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. Real-world engagement is a hallmark of the master's program: all students are required to complete internships or mentorships in the field.
The MSI program is highly interdisciplinary, featuring faculty from a wide range of academic fields. It draws students from diverse undergraduate majors, ranging from the arts and humanities to science and engineering.
Master's students may specialize in the following areas:
Students may also opt for a self-designed curriculum under the guidance of a faculty member.
In 2011, the School of Information and the School of Public Health offered a new join graduate program in Health Informatics. The first class graduated in the Fall of 2012. Students in the Health Informatics program take 52 credits specializing in epidemiology, health management and policy, and health behavior and education from the School of Public Health, combined with the design and evaluation of effective information systems learned in the School of Information.
Doctoral degree.
The school's doctoral program is a full-time course of study, typically four years post-baccalaureate, leading to the Doctor of Information (Ph.D.). The program is designed to enable students to engage in advanced study and research in a various information fields such as the economics of information, human-computer interaction, library and information services, organizational issues, archives and records management, new systems architecture, digital libraries, information systems management, and digital documents/digital publishing.
Faculty and research.
Faculty at the school are drawn from an unusually wide range of academic backgrounds including linguistics, public policy, computer science, library and information science, management, law, business, economics, psychology, history, and communications.
The school's faculty and students are active in research, pursuing projects in various areas and methods. Their stated goal is to develop an integrated understanding of human needs in relation to information systems and social structures, searching for unifying principles that illuminate the role of information in computation, cognition, communication, and community.
The school's infrastructure includes a range of research facilities and equipment. Researchers also have access to a number of off-campus research sites. Projects are often collaborations with researchers from other units at the university.
Established and emerging areas of research at the school include:
History.
Before 1992, the School of Information was the School of Information and Library Studies. In 1992, the president of the University of Michigan, James Duderstadt appointed Daniel E. Atkins III as the dean of the school. Under the direction of Dr. Atkins and with support from Duderstadt and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the school became the School of Information with the intent to reach beyond traditional library science arena. The School of Information was officially established in 1996 offering a master's of science in information with some specializations (library and information science, archives and record management, human computer interaction, information economics management and policy, and a tailored program).

Aleksey Trubetskoy

Aleksey Nikitich Trubetskoy (, "Aleksy Nikitycz Trubecki"; ; 17 March 1600? – 1680) was the last Prince of Trubetsk (under authority of the Republic of Both Nations) 1634–1645, and (under authority of Muscovian Tsardom; ) 17 March 1660 – June 1672, the godfather of Peter I of Russia.
Under Tsar Michael's rule Aleksey Trubetskoy was in disfavour with Russia's factual ruler Patriarch Filaret and was appointed to govern distant towns of Tobolsk and Astrakhan. But the situation changed after Michael's death in 1645 and Alexis I's succession to the throne, when Trubetskoy's close friend Boris Morozov became a head of government. In 1646 Trubetskoy was appointed a commander of the Tsar's personal Guard regiment.
In 1654 Prince Aleksey Trubetskoy on the side of Alexis I of Russia led the southern flank of the Muscovite army from Bryansk to Ukraine. The territory between the Dniepr and Berezyna was overrun quickly, with Aleksey Trubetskoy taking Mścisław and Rosławl. In 1654 the former Principality of Trubetsk was finally conquered by Aleksey Trubetskoy, Prince of Trubetsk himself, as a result of the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667). In 1656 the second Muscovian army advanced in the north of Swedish Livonia and besieged Tartu. In 1659 a Muscovite army, led by Aleksey Trubetskoy, crossed into Ukraine and was partly defeated by a Ruthenian–Tatar army led by Ivan Vyhovsky in the Battle of Konotop. In 1659 he negotiated the Second Treaty of Pereiaslav with Yurii Khmelnytsky. In 1659 Aleksey Trubetskoy together with Ivan Sirko, who went to Zaporozhian Sich in 1654, and became a polkovnyk (colonel), fought against the Crimean Khanate.
Trubetskoy was married to Ekaterina Pushkina (died 1669), a sister of Boyar Boris Pushkin, a prominent statesman. He died childless. His mother was Eudokia Trubetska and his father was Nikita Trubetskoy (16th century – January 1608). He had brothers Wigund-Jeronym Trubetsky and Fyodor Trubetskoy.

Quitline

Quitline is a telephone helpline offering treatment for addiction and behavior change/issues. Presently most quitlines treat tobacco or alcohol addiction. Quitlines are treatment centres that offer advanced treatment and should not be confused with call centres.
Smoking cessation quitlines.
Tobacco quitlines have proven to be comparable to cessation clinics in terms of proportion of smokers smoke free at follow-up but are more cost effective. [5 In general quitlines have been reported to enhance 12-month abstinence rates from 7% to approximately 30%. [6-9]
The treatment protocol in most tobacco cessation quitlines is a mixture of motivational interviewing , behaviour therapy, and pharmacological consultation. Qutiline numbers are presently printed on cigarette packages in several countries as a part of the health warning labels. Tobacco quitlines may offer a reactive service, meaning that counsellors initiate no contact but clients signing up for support are encouraged to call the service whenever they need. Or a proactive service where clients signing up for treatment are offered a call up service. Many quitlines offer both reactive and proactive treatments and leave it up to the client to choose.
Alcohol quitlines.
Telephone based advice (call centres) for alcoholics and their relatives are relatively common and some are gradually developing into telephone based treatment centres. However, alcohol quitlines are still at their infancy. In Sweden where telephone-based treatment for tobacco addiction is well established, an advanced alcohol treatment quitline (first of its kind) opened in January 2007. The service is run in close collaboration with the Swedish national tobacco quitline. The primary aim of the Swedish alcohol quitline is to support people who are starting to lose control over their alcohol consumption to regain control. The treatment protocol is based on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy offering support to excessive consumers of alcohol and relatives alike.

William Holmes (Australian general)

Major General William Holmes CMG, DSO, VD (12 September 1862 – 2 July 1917) was an Australian Army Major General in World War I. He was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the ground won at the Battle of Messines.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Holmes was born in Sydney on 12 September 1862, the son of Captain William Holmes, the chief clerk at New South Wales Military Forces Headquarters. Holmes lived in the Victoria Barracks and was educated Paddington Public School.
Holmes worked at the Sydney Mint and then joined the Department of Works as a clerk on 24 June 1878. On 24 August 1887, he married Susan Ellen Green, whose family also lived in the Victoria barracks. On 20 April 1888 he became chief clerk and paymaster of the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. Under his leadership, the department underwent a major expansion and the Cataract, Cordeaux and Avon dams were built.
In 1872 at the age of 10 Holmes joined the 1st Infantry Regiment of the New South Wales Military Forces as a bugler and served in every enlisted rank. Holmes served for 18 months in a submarine mining company before returning to the regiment and being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1886. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1890, captain in 1894 and major in 1900.
Boer War.
In 1899, Holmes volunteered for service in South Africa. The company left for South Africa in November 1899, and on arrival was incorporated in the Australian Regiment. Originally an infantry unit, it became mounted in February. He saw action at Colesberg, Pretoria and Diamond Hill in June 1900, where he was wounded. Holmes was mentioned in dispatches, promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He reurned home in August 1900.
Holmes commanded the 1st Australian Infantry from 1902 to 1911. He was promoted to colonel on 6 January 1912 and was appointed to command the 6th Infantry Brigade.
The Great War.
German New Guinea.
Shortly after war broke out, a special expeditionary force, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, was formed to occupy German possessions in New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. Under Holmes command the force sailed from Sydney on the auxiliary cruiser HMAS "Berrima" on 19 August 1914. The German governor surrendered to Holmes on 17 September 1914 and the British flag was raised over the town.
Holmes was criticised in Australia for offering extremely lenient terms, but he was under orders to occupy, not annex, German New Guinea. Holmes became administrator of New Guinea. He relinquished the post to Colonel S Petheridge in January 1915 and returned to Australia, where his appointment to the AN&MEF was terminated on 6 February 1915.
Gallipoli.
On 16 March 1915, Holmes was appointed to the First Australian Imperial Force as commander of the newly formed 5th Infantry Brigade with the rank of colonel. The brigade left Sydney in May and arrived in Egypt in June 1915, where it became part of the 2nd Division.
The 5th Brigade began moving to Gallipoli in early August and Holmes arrived on the 19th. The brigade was placed at the disposal of Major General A Godley of the New Zealand and Australian Division and elements participated in the fighting for Hill 60. The 5th Brigade took over the trenches facing the Nek from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on 28 August 1915. Holmes made a habit of regularly visiting every key part of his front lines. When Major General Legge fell ill in November and was evacuated, Holmes took over acting command of the 2nd Division.
Western Front.
After the evacuation of Anzac, Holmes returned to the 5th Brigade, which he took to the Western Front in April 1916. He led the brigade in the attacks on the Pozieres Heights in August and at Flers in October 1916. In January 1917, Holmes was given command of the 4th Division, replacing Major General H. V. Cox.
Holmes continued his habit of personally reconnoitring every part of his line. On 31 March 1917, he paid a daylight visit to an outpost near Lagnicourt, as usual wearing his red hat band, accompanied by his aide, Lieutenant Fergusson. Holmes was sniped at but not hit; Fergusson was hit and had to be left behind, to be evacuated after nightfall. Shortly afterwards the post was shelled, causing heavy casualties to the garrison, including Fergusson who was injured for a second time.
Holmes commanded his division at Bullecourt in April, where he opposed the operation that ultimately caused his division very heavy losses, and at Messines in June. On 2 July 1917, Holmes took the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman, to survey the Messines battlefield. The party left his car in order to avoid a dangerous corner, something Holmes usually would not do. As they set out on foot, a German shell, believed to be a seventy-seven, or a "pip-squeak" landed nearby and Holmes was hit through the chest and lung. His aide, Captain Maxwell, along with Frank Edwards the private secretary to W.A Holman, took Holmes to the nearest aid post, where he died. He was buried at Trois Arbres Cemetery, Steenwerck, France. Holmes was the most senior Australian officer killed in action on the Western Front.
Memorial.
William Homes Street in the Potts Hill Business Park, Potts Hill New South Wales is named after Major General William Holmes. Potts Hill Business Park is on the edge of the Potts Hill reservoir, a major water storage operated by Sydney Water. General Holmes Drive that runs between Botany Bay and Sydney Airport is named after him.

The Face on the Poster

"The Face on the Poster" is the sixth episode of the eighth series of the British comedy series "Dad's Army" that was originally broadcast on 10 October 1975.
Synopsis.
The platoon start a recruiting campaign, and Jones is chosen as the face for the poster. Unfortunately, due to a mix-up at the printers, his face gets planted on an escaped prisoner of war poster.
Plot.
Wilson enters Mainwaring's office to find him writing a Confidential Report about him. Mainwaring shows it to him so he can sign it and make sure he's playing fair. Wilson scoffs at his attempts, comparing it to a headmaster's end-of-term report. Mainwaring isn't quite so blasé, and hints that the Confidential Report could lead to big changes. He hints that he may be promoted to Major very soon, and admits he wants to start a recruiting campaign to triple the platoon and turn it into a company.
He convenes a parade and tells them of his plan. Jones suggests a poster similar to that of Lord Kitchener's recruitment poster, and Mainwaring is delighted with the suggestion. Jones then suggests a secret ballot to decide the face for the poster, and Frazer decides to bring in a professional photographer.
Jones wins the ballot by a large margin and the photographer turns out to be Mr Blewitt. After four unsuccessful attempts, the photo is taken, and Wilson takes it round to the printers.
At the printers, a police officer is asking for a Wanted poster of an escaped prisoner of war to be printed. The photo is placed on the out-tray along with Jones' photo on top.
Two days later, Godfrey brings in a sample of the poster, and the platoon discover that the disorganised printer mixed the photographs up. Jones now appears to be a wanted man.
Jones notices the poster outside a Free Polish Club. A Polish Army major comes out, comments on the poster, "Ugly-looking swine," and then sees Jones is the man on the poster. Jones is arrested and interrogated; despite his protests, the major persists in believing Jones is the escaper, and puts him in the local POW camp.
Hodges drives Mainwaring and the rest of the platoon to the POW camp, where they too are arrested by the same major. Mainwaring puts his foot in it by declaring Jones is his colleague, and they are all placed in the POW camp with Jones. Wilson comments that the Colonel won't be very impressed with what's happened, and wonders what he'll write in Mainwaring's Confidential Report.
Notes.
When catching sight of a sign to a Free Polish club for refugees, Pike mistakenly believes they are giving away free polish.

He lives in State College, Pennsylvania, where he was born, and also in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Educated at Penn State and Harvard, Anesko published in 1986 a groundbreaking study of the economic factors that shaped Henry James' literary career. Titled ""Friction with the Market": Henry James and the Profession of Authorship", the book argued against the image of James as a mandarin artist who ignored the dictates of the marketplace. Anesko showed how James actively sought the best prices for his works, used literary agents extensively, and was not afraid to pit one publisher against another. The book also calculated James' income from his writings for each year of his career, and explored how James constructed the "New York Edition" (1907–1909) of his works.
In 1997 Anesko published a complete collection of the correspondence between James and his friend and editor, William Dean Howells. The collection, "Letters, Fictions, Lives: Henry James and William Dean Howells" showed how the two writers' careers developed from their earliest days to eventual prominence in their profession. Again, the focus was on the interaction between professional demands and artistic development.
Besides these books Anesko has contributed many articles to journals and anthologies on American literature, especially the 19th century realists. He is a past president of the Henry James Society (publisher of the "Henry James Review") and has been honored for his work as a faculty advisor at Penn State. His research interests include the history of book publishing, authorship as a profession, and sociological aspects of literature. He has written a study of nineteenth-century French critics of the American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, which will be published by Ohio State University Press.

Look to Norway

The "Look to Norway" speech by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was given during the handover ceremony of the Royal Norwegian Navy ship HNoMS "King Haakon VII" at the Washington Navy Yard on 16 September 1942. The speech served as an important source of inspiration to Norwegians fighting the German occupation of Norway and the rest of Europe as well as for the resistance fighters of other small countries during World War II.
In the speech the President said:
"If there is anyone who still wonders why this war is being fought, let him look to Norway. If there is anyone who has any delusions that this war could have been averted, let him look to Norway; and if there is anyone who doubts the democratic will to win, again I say, let him look to Norway."
The speech also made an impact on Norwegian-Americans and the rest of the American public's opinion on the struggle in Europe. The impression of the Norwegian's situation had been severely damaged by an article by the American reporter, Leland Stowe, who happened to be in Oslo on the day the Germans marched into the city. He witnessed shocked Norwegian civilians standing around watching the Germans march down the parade street Karl Johans gate. He misinterpreted the shock as indifference and acceptance on the part of the Norwegian population and wrote a stinging article in "Time" and several newspapers which severely damaged the American public's opinion of the Norwegian resistance and therefore their motivation to help Norway and Europe. The speech corrected that impression.
In a speech on 13 April 1940, the President had already praised the Norwegian resistance movement. Roosevelt's interest in Norway was in part due to the good relations established by Norwegian Crown Prince Olav and his wife, Princess Martha, and the Norwegian ambassador to the U.S., Wilhelm Thorleif von Munthe af Morgenstierne (1887-1963).
In 2005, His Majesty King Harald V of Norway visited the Washington Navy Yard to view events including a reenactment of President Roosevelt's "Look to Norway" speech, honoring the United States and Norway's long-term alliance. The ceremony was to mark the centenary of diplomatic relations between the nations of Norway and the United States.
In popular culture.
The 1943 Hollywood-film "Edge of Darkness" starring Errol Flynn told the story of a fictional fishing village in Norway starting an armed uprising against their German occupiers. It ends in a massive battle in the town centre, where even the priest starts machine-gunning enemy soldiers. The "Look to Norway" speech is then read through the end credits by a Roosevelt voice impersonator.

<doc id="4877759" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877759" title="Stepwise regression">
Stepwise regression

In statistics, stepwise regression includes regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure.
The frequent practice of fitting the final selected model followed by reporting estimates and confidence intervals without adjusting them to take the model building process into account has led to calls to stop using stepwise model building altogether or to at least make sure model uncertainty is correctly reflected.
[[Image:Stepwise.jpg|thumb|right|500px|In this example from engineering, necessity and sufficiency are usually determined by F-tests.
For additional consideration, when planning an experiment, computer simulation, or scientific survey to collect data for this model, one must keep in mind the number of parameters, "P", to estimate and adjust the sample size accordingly. For K variables, "P" = 1(Start) + "K"(Stage I) + ("K"2 − "K")/2(Stage II) + 3"K"(Stage III) = 0.5"K"2 + 3.5"K" + 1. For "K" < 17, an efficient design of experiments exists for this type of model, a Box–Behnken design, augmented with positive and negative axial points of length min(2, (int(1.5 + "K"/4))1/2), plus point(s) at the origin. There are more efficient designs, requiring fewer runs, even for "K" > 16.]]
Main approaches.
The main approaches are:
A widely used algorithm was first proposed by Efroymson (1960). This is an automatic procedure for statistical model selection in cases where there is a large number of potential explanatory variables, and no underlying theory on which to base the model selection. The procedure is used primarily in regression analysis, though the basic approach is applicable in many forms of model selection. This is a variation on forward selection. At each stage in the process, after a new variable is added, a test is made to check if some variables can be deleted without appreciably increasing the residual sum of squares (RSS). The procedure terminates when the measure is (locally) maximized, or when the available improvement falls below some critical value.
Selection criterion.
One of the main issues with stepwise regression is that it searches a large space of possible models. Hence it is prone to overfitting the data. In other words, stepwise regression will often fit much better in sample than it does on new out-of-sample data. This problem can be mitigated if the criterion for adding (or deleting) a variable is stiff enough. The key line in the sand is at what can be thought of as the Bonferroni point: namely how significant the best spurious variable should be based on chance alone. On a "t"-statistic scale, this occurs at about formula_1, where "p" is the number of predictors. Unfortunately, this means that many variables which actually carry signal will not be included. This fence turns out to be the right trade-off between over-fitting and missing signal. If we look at the risk of different cutoffs, then using this bound will be within a 2log"p" factor of the best possible risk. Any other cutoff will end up having a larger such risk inflation.
Model accuracy.
A way to test for errors in models created by step-wise regression, is to not rely on the model's "F"-statistic, significance, or multiple R, but instead assess the model against a set of data that was not used to create the model. This is often done by building a model based on a sample of the dataset available (e.g., 70%) and use the remaining 30% dataset to assess the accuracy of the model. Accuracy is then often measured as the actual standard error (SE), MAPE, or mean error between the predicted value and the actual value in the hold-out sample. This method is particularly valuable when data is collected in different settings (e.g., different times, social vs. solitary situations) or when models are assumed to be generalizable.
Criticism.
Stepwise regression procedures are used in data mining, but are controversial. Several points of criticism have been made.
Such criticisms, based upon limitations of the relationship between a model and procedure and data set used to fit it, are usually addressed by verifying the model on an independent data set, as in the PRESS procedure.
Critics regard the procedure as a paradigmatic example of data dredging, intense computation often being an inadequate substitute for subject area expertise. Additionally, the results of stepwise regression are often used incorrectly without adjusting them for the occurrence of model selection. Especially the practice of fitting the final selected model as if no model selection had taken place and reporting of estimates and confidence intervals as if least-squares theory were valid for them, has been described as a scandal. Widespread incorrect usage and the availability of alternatives such as Ensemble learning, leaving all variables in the model, or using expert judgement to identify relevant variables have led to calls to totally avoid stepwise model selection.

Vincent Square

Vincent Square is a large grass-covered square in Westminster, London, England, covering 13 acres. It provides playing fields for Westminster School, which privately owns it.
It was created by Dean Vincent, Headmaster of Westminster School, a few hundred yards away, who, on seeing that development was beginning to encroach on the wastelands of Tothill Fields (which was a former plague pit), paid for a bank and ditch to enclose a suitable playing area for the schoolboys .
After the Second World War, the school resisted the efforts of the local authority to make the square available for public use .
The square contains a cricket pavilion [http://www.flickr.com/photos/malcnhg/846533472/], four football pitches, several tennis courts, and the groundsman's house, and is used every weekday by Westminster Under School during breaks.

Picton Castle

Picton Castle () is a medieval castle near Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Originally built at the end of the 13th century by Sir John Wogan and is still inhabited by his descendants, the Philipps family (see Baron Milford and Viscount St Davids).
History.
The estates, gardens and parkland of Picton Castle was once part of the larger Manor of Wiston, but became a separate holding, replacing Wiston Castle by the 13th century. Picton Castle began as a motte castle and was reconstructed in stone by the Wogan family during the 13th century. In 1405, French troops supporting Owain Glyndŵr attacked and held the Castle, and it was seized again during the English Civil War in 1645 by Parliamentary forces.
The Picton Castle estate was acquired by the Phillips family when Sir Thomas ap Philip of Cilsant married Jane, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Dwnn, of Picton in the 1490s. Sir John Philipps, who inherited the castle in the 15th century, remodelled the building and created a new entrance which remained until the 1820s when a new entrance was designed by Thomas Rowlands (who also designed Slebech Church).
The estate remained with the Phillips family until the death of Lord Milford in 1823, when it was inherited by his cousin Richard Grant, who assumed the surname Philipps and was created a Baronet in 1828 and Baron Milford in 1847. His heir was his half-brother, the Reverend James Henry Alexander Philipps (formerly Gwyther), who assumed by royal licence the surname and arms of Philipps. On his death the estate passed to his son-in-law, Charles Edward Gregg Philipps, who was created a Baronet, of Picton, in 1887 (see Philipps Baronets) then to Sir Richard Foley Foley-Philipps, cousin of Sir John Erasmus, and grandson of Charles Edward Gregg Philipps. The estate is now run by the Picton Castle Trust, and the present board member, Susie Philipps, lives in a lodge in the grounds.

Héctor Cúper

Héctor Raúl Cúper (born 16 November 1955 in Chabás, Santa Fe Province, Argentina) is an Argentinean former football defender, now manager, who last managed Al Wasl in the UAE Arabian Gulf League.
Career.
Coach.
Cúper started his coaching career with Huracán, a year and a half after his retirement. After three years he moved to Lanús, and two years later he made the jump to Europe. In 1997 he was hired by Mallorca, and in the very first season he drove the modest club to the final of the Copa del Rey, which he would lose against Barcelona. The following season the team reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, where they lost to Lazio. However, in the same season the team had its revenge against Barcelona, winning the 1998 Supercopa de España. That season Mallorca also recorded their best historical position at the end of the league with a 3rd place, allowing the team to play in the UEFA Champions League.
Cúper moved to Valencia in 1999, where he maintained his bad luck in finals, losing the final of the Champions League two consecutive times; in 2000 against Real Madrid, and in 2001 against Bayern Munich on penalty shootout.
In 2001, Cúper was hired by Italian club Internazionale, where he reached the third and second place of the championship in successive seasons. In the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League, his team lost in the semi-finals to city rivals AC Milan on away goals. Inter under his command infamously lost what could have been the club's first scudetto since 1989 on the 5th of May 2002 ater losing 4–2 against Lazio and handed the scudetto over to fierce rivals Juventus on the last day of the league season. He was fired from the club after six matches of the 2003–04 season, when the team was in 8th place in Serie A.
After a year off, due to a contractual argument with Inter, Cúper managed Mallorca again during the 2004–05 season, when the team was already in a relegation position after 10 matches, saving the team from relegation in the last match of the season. Suffering bad results in spite of his many signings, Cúper decided to leave the team in February 2006, with the team at the bottom of the league.
He started the 2007–08 season at the helm of Real Betis, but was sacked on 2 December 2007 following his side's loss against Atlético Madrid. On 11 March 2008 he was unveiled as the new boss of relegation-battling Serie A team Parma, replacing Domenico Di Carlo at the helm of the "gialloblù". He was then sacked two months later before the final game of the season after winning only two in 10 matches as manager, this eventually leading to Parma's relegation to Serie B. 
On 1 August 2008, Cúper became the head coach of the Georgia national team. But due to his failure to win a single match as Georgia's head coach, he didn't prolong the contract when it expired in December 2009.
On 3 November 2009, Cúper agreed to continue his managerial career with Greek club Aris Thessaloniki until the end of the 2009–10 season. On 15 December 2009, Cuper extended his contract with Aris until June 2011. On 24 April Cúper lost another final, this time in the Greek Football Cup against Panathinaikos, continuing his negative streak in finals.
In the 2010–2011 season, Cúper lead Aris in its first participation in the Round of 32 of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League, taking the 2nd place in Group B with 10 points, after two surprise wins against Atlético Madrid. On 18 January 2011 after some bad results in Greece, Héctor decided to step down from his managerial position.
On 29 June 2011 Cúper moved to Racing Santander signing for one season. However, after five months he resigned from his position due to the poor performance of the team, which was placed at the bottom in La Liga. He signed a contract with Süper Lig side Orduspor on 19 December 2011, but left by mutual consent on 13 April 2013.
On 14 November 2013, Cúper was announced as new head coach of the UAE League side Al Wasl.

Frederic Hughes

Major General Frederic Godfrey Hughes CB (26 January 1858 – 23 August 1944) was an Australian Army Major General in World War I.
Early life and career.
Frederic Godfrey Hughes was born on 26 January 1858 in the Melbourne suburb of Windsor, the son of a grazier. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and became a clerk for a land valuer. Later he set up his own land valuation business. Hughes became involved in local politics and in 1898 was elected a St Kilda City Councillor. He served for 24 years and was Mayor of St Kilda from 1901 to 1902, and again from 1911 to 1912. He had various business interests, including directorships of Dunlop Rubber and South Broken Hill.
Hughes joined the St Kilda Artillery Battery as a driver in 1875. He became a sergeant in 1883 and was commissioned in 1885. On 20 August 1888 he was promoted to captain and took command of the Victorian Nordenfeldt Battery. Hughes was promoted to major in 1891. His battery was disbanded on 30 June 1897 and Hughes was transferred to the field artillery and became at staff officer at Headquarters in Melbourne. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1900. In 1903, he was given command of the 11th Light Horse Regiment. On 6 December 1907 he was promoted to colonel and took command of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, which was renamed the 7th Light Horse Brigade in 1912. In 1909, Hughes became aide de camp to the Governor General.
World War I.
Hughes was appointed to the First Australian Imperial Force as a colonel on 17 October 1914 and given command of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Like most militia brigadiers, Hughes was given a regular officer as a brigade major, in his case, Lieutenant Colonel John Antill. Although not an easy man to get along with, Hughes relied heavily on Antill.
The brigade departed for Egypt in February 1915 where it trained until alerted for dismounted action at Gallipoli in May. It arrived on 20 May 1915 and became part of Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division. The ANZAC commander, Lieutenant General Birdwood, had grave doubts about Hughes capacity.
Godley ordered Hughes to attack the Turkish positions at the Nek at 0430 on 7 August 1915 with a bayonet charge in support of the New Zealand attack on Chunuk Bair. The attack stalled from the very beginning, when the artillery lifted some seven minutes early according to watches on Russell's Top. Then four waves of light horsemen charged the Turkish trenches at the Nek, only to be cut down.
Hughes mismanaged the battle. He left his headquarters around the time the second wave of 150 had attacked in order to try to observe the attack, thereby isolating himself from Antill and the rest of his headquarters. After the third wave had been slaughtered, Hughes gave orders for the attack to be discontinued, but not in time to save the fourth wave. He seems to have become completely rattled.
Hughes was evacuated from Gallipoli on 20 September 1915 with typhoid. He was evacuated to Australia in March 1916 suffering from typhoid and pneumonia. In July 1918, he was reappointed to the AIF and served with the Sea Transport Service. He retired in March 1920 with the rank of major general.
Post war.
Hughes died in St Kilda on 23 August 1944 at age 86.

Michael Murray (organist)

Michael Murray is an American-born organist and writer.
Biography.
Murray studied at Butler University and the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, before private study with Marcel Dupré in Paris. (He was the last important student of Dupré, of whom he would later write a biography.) During the 1968-69 performance season, Murray performed the complete organ works of Bach in a series of twelve recitals in Cleveland. He later commemorated the 150th birthday of César Franck by playing that composer's complete organ works in 1972. He repeated the cycle for the hundredth anniversary of Franck's death (1990, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.) Murray's performances have included nearly every major city in North America, with numerous appearances as a soloist with major orchestras. Critics hailed Murray's rare combination of technique, thoughtfulness, and musical feeling. He has made many recordings on the Telarc label, featuring the works of Bach, Franck, Saint-Saëns, and others.
Murray is now retired from concert performing and recording, and is the principal organist at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Columbus, Ohio. He is also a librarian in the Music and Dance Library at The Ohio State University.
Murray has written many articles and has published five books. His "Marcel Dupré: The Work of a Master Organist" (Northeastern University Press, ISBN 0-930350-65-0) is in its third printing. He has also written "French Masters of the Organ" (Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-07291-0) and served as editor for "A Jacques Barzun Reader" (HarperCollins, ISBN 0-06-093542-1). He has written a biography of Jacques Barzun, "Jacques Barzun: Portrait of a Mind" (Frederic C. Beil, ISBN 1929490410).
Murray has been awarded an honorary doctorate by The Ohio State University (2000).

HNoMS Kjell

HNoMS "Kjell" was the final ship of twenty-seven 2nd class torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy, launched at the Royal Norwegian Navy's shipyard in Horten on 12 March 1912 with build number 106. "Kjell" saw more than 32 years of service, the first 28 years in the Royal Norwegian Navy during the First World War and in the interwar period, the last four in the "Kriegsmarine", having been captured in the first days of the 1940 Norwegian Campaign. After being rebuilt as a minesweeper by the Germans, she was sunk by Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito fighter bombers on 28 September 1944. Divers rediscovered the shipwreck in 2006.
The name "Kjell" derives from the early-20th century version of the Norwegian word "tjeld", meaning the Eurasian Oystercatcher.
Characteristics.
"Kjell" was the last of 27 small, cigar shaped pre-First World War torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy. The other ships in her post-1905 series were the 1906 "Teist" (Black Guillemot) and the 1907 "Skarv" (Cormorant). The series' main armament consisted of two deck-mounted torpedo launchers and one fixed torpedo tube in the bow. While "Teist" and "Skarv" were both armed with two 47 mm guns, "Kjell" was equipped with a single 76 mm main gun. Unlike all the preceding Norwegian torpedo boats the Officers' Mess on board "Kjell" was located in the bow section, with easy access to the command position in the tower.
First World War.
The Royal Norwegian Navy mobilized on 2 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. With Norway having declared herself a neutral country the torpedo boats were ordered to carry the lion's share of the neutrality protection patrols. This was despite their less than satisfactory seaworthiness in open seas, having been designed for service close to shore and in the many Norwegian fjords. The background for the decision to deploy the torpedo boats as the main Norwegian patrol force was based on the small ships being more economic to operate than the navy's larger vessels in a time of uncertain coal and oil supplies. In one episode during her First World War service "Kjell" intercepted a British submarine on 2 July 1916. The submarine had violated Norwegian territorial waters off Lindesnes and proceeded to hail and fire upon the 578 ton Norwegian steamer SS "Prunelle" of Bergen. Although the British submarine managed to dive and make good its escape the neutrality violation had been so well documented that the UK government later issued an apology to its Norwegian counterpart.
Inter-war period.
By the end of the First World War the Norwegian torpedo boat fleet had been worn down by constant service and 14 of the vessels were decommissioned and disposed of in 1920. Twenty-three torpedo boats, including "Kjell", were obliged to continue in service due to budgetary restrictions despite being long outdated and ready for replacement. Although officially still in service the torpedo boats spent most of the inter-war period in port, only being equipped for exercises some two to three months every year.
Intercepting smugglers.
For "Kjell" the 1922 exercise season turned out somewhat unusual as she was deployed against alcohol smugglers on the coast as part of the enforcement of the 1916–1927 Norwegian prohibition. During 20 days in September 1922 "Kjell" operated off Færder in Tjøme, soon earning the nickname "Terror of the smugglers" (Norw. "Smugglernes skrekk") by confiscating on average of spirits a day. At the conclusion of the 20 day anti-smuggling cruise each member of the torpedo boat's crew received the then-substantial amount of 382 Norwegian kroner in prize money.
Second World War.
Norwegian service.
Neutrality protection.
At the outbreak of the Second World War the Norwegian torpedo boat force was again deployed guarding the coastline against neutrality violations. "Kjell" was at that time part of the 2. Torpedo boat Division in the Kristiansand section of the 1st Naval District, covering the southernmost part of the Norwegian coastline. As had been the case during the First World War the torpedo boats were once more spread singly along the coastline.
Rescuing a Norwegian aircrew.
One incident in which "Kjell" was involved was when she on 14 October 1939 rescued from the skerry Østre Flandern near Flekkerøy the three-man crew of Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 F.320, which had made an emergency landing after suffering engine failure. "Kjell" recovered the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service crew in the early afternoon of 14 October, while the wreck of F.320 was retrieved by the patrol boat "Lyngdal" the next day.
"Altmark" Incident.
One of the tasks given to the Norwegian torpedo boat force as part of their renewed neutrality protection duties was the escort and inspection of vessels belonging to the warring parties. One of these missions included the control and escort of the German auxiliary tanker "Altmark" in February 1940. "Altmark" was returning to Germany after having supported the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" in the South Atlantic. On her return voyage to Germany she was carrying 299 British merchant sailors as prisoners of war, and entered Norwegian waters north of Trondheimsfjord on 14 February 1940. The transport of POWs through neutral territorial waters was not in violation of public international law, and as Norwegian authorities feared an incident between the German ship and the Royal Navy the ship was allowed passage through the restricted areas at Bergen. The passage at Bergen was in violation of official Norwegian neutrality regulations as the tanker was a state-operated vessel of a warring party. As "Altmark" proceeded southwards to Germany she was escorted along the way by various Norwegian warships. On the day after she entered Norwegian waters, 15 February, the "Altmark" was spotted by British reconnaissance aircraft and soon after confronted by a force of six Royal Navy destroyers. In an effort to avoid capture "Altmark" sought shelter in the Jøssingfjord, in the area between Egersund and Flekkefjord, now under the escort of "Kjell" and fellow torpedo boat "Skarv". Ignoring protests from the Norwegian naval vessels, which commanders were under direct orders not to fire at the British, the destroyer HMS "Cossack" entered Jøssingfjord at 2220hrs on 16 February and boarded the German ship, killing six, mortally wounding one of the German crew and freeing the British prisoners. The failure of "Kjell" and the other Norwegian warships to intervene in the blatant neutrality violation led Hitler to speed up plans for a German invasion of Norway, six days after the incident appointing General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst as commander of the operation. One of the immediate German reactions to the incident was a demand that the commanders of "Kjell" and "Skarv" be dismissed, although this was quickly dropped following the recommendation of the German legation in Oslo. The Norwegian government on its part issued strong protests to the UK government, President of the Norwegian Parliament C. J. Hambro stating that the united Norwegian parliament and people protested the British intrusion at Jøssingfjord.
U-21.
Another incident occurred the following month when, on 27 March 1940, the German U-boat "U-21" accidentally ran aground at Oddene near Ryvingen south-east of Mandal. Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 F.328 landed near the U-boat and guarded it until Norwegian naval vessels reached the scene and interned the crew. "U-21" was towed to Kristiansand the next day under escort of "Kjell", "Teist", the destroyer "Odin" and the "B" class submarine "B-2".
The German invasion.
On 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion, "Kjell" was in Kristiansand carrying out repairs which were finished by afternoon. The next morning she was ordered to nearby Marvika naval base to take on board torpedoes. However, before the vessel could be made war ready orders came through from the commander of the local naval section that resistance to the German invasion in the Kristiansand area was to cease. As the Germans occupied Marvika "Kjell" was allowed to move to nearby Vigebukta bay in the Topdalsfjord. On 11 April the torpedo boat was seized by German infantry and at 1830hrs the German war flag was raised, signalling the ship's transfer to "Kriegsmarine" service.
German service.
Initially renamed "KT1" and used as a Vorpostenboot the torpedo boat was later rebuilt as a minesweeper under the name NK.02 "Dragoner". Serving as a patrol boat and escort vessel on the coast of occupied Norway she was sailing alone off Ryvingen near Mandal when she was discovered and attacked by six No. 248 Squadron RAF de Havilland Mosquito fighter bombers on 28 September 1944. After a brief and futile fight she was sunk by a combination of autocannon fire and a depth charge exploding underneath her midship section. Of the 25 Germans on board at the time of the sinking 18 survived, seven of whom were wounded. The attacking RAF aircraft suffered no damage from the German return-fire and all returned to base.
Discovery of the wreck.
The wreck of "Dragoner " was discovered partly intact at some depth several kilometres from land by a team of three Norwegian divers in February 2006. The wreck has since been declared a war grave.

John Osborn Williams

John Osborn Williams (28 March 1886 - 6 July 1963) was the owner of the logging and pit prop exporting business known as The Labrador Development Company limited based in Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador from 1934-1948.
Early life.
Williams was born at 46 George Street, Cardiff, Wales, his parents’ home, and was the youngest son of Silas and Mary Williams. He was one of eight children and known as “Jack” within the family. He left school at 14 in 1900 and entered the timber exporting business. "Jayo" as he was usually known, like two of his brothers Hiram and Arthur, became a commercial clerk at the age of fifteen.
The family’s heavy industrial and clerical occupational experience was the background for at least two other logging, trading, and shipping agency companies he was to set up. In 1908, at 22 years of age, he moved to work for Evans and Reed, Cardiff coal exporters and importers of pit props. In 1914 during the First World War, he worked in the Baltic area, and in August of that year, he went to Montreal, spending September to December 1914 in Dominion of Newfoundland. From the end of the war, he sought to develop his business interests on the island. In 1921, he obtained £10,000 
backing from Franklin Thomas and Company, Cardiff coal importer, to help him set up J. O. Williams Company in 1925. However, the liquidation of the British and North American Trading Company in which Williams had shares bankrupted him.
Development of the Labrador area.
Before the company arrived at the present day site of Port Hope Simpson, certain events had taken place. It was on board the S.S. Sylvia en route to St. John's, Newfoundland from City of Halifax, Nova Scotia that Williams first discussed his ambitions for the Labrador with Sir John Hope Simpson, Commissioner of Natural Resources and Acting - Commissioner of Justice 1934-36 and Thomas Lodge, Commissioner of Public Utilities from 1934–1937. He won them over with his enthusiasm, optimism and experience and convinced them he was just the sort of entrepreneurial man they were looking for. For their part, they could not believe their good luck in having met him. They viewed Williams as somebody who could help them make an impact in their new posts. Lodge described Williams to The Dominions Office in London as 1/3 Visionary, 1/3 Speculator and 1/3 Business man. However, time would tell that Simpson and Lodge had made a grave error of judgment about entering into a business relationship with Williams who was to prove more than a match for all the civil servants in London and St. John’s combined.
In June 1934 the first party of managerial and administrative staff landed at the site on the Alexis River. Williams had hired 520 men; southern Inuit men from nearby communities and unemployed men from the island of Newfoundland who came on government passes to work. He showed that some sort of permanent employment in addition to the cod fishery was possible in the area, and even though he brought south Labrador Inuit and Newfoundlanders together, most Newfoundlanders did not stay for more than two or three years. However, because of southern Inuit families moving into the area to participate in the new economic projects, it was reported that there were almost 70 families in Port Hope Simpson in 1934.
Within one month, however, by 26 July 1934, 225 lumbermen of the Labrador Development Company returned to St John’s because they were dissatisfied with their working conditions. Although the men were keen to work they found poor accommodation and little food. The company controlled everyone through the very strict manager and because Williams prohibited any buying and selling outside his store. (Although one enterprising local did bring a boatload of goods upriver to Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, moored offshore and proceeded to do a brisk trade before he was stopped.) Workers were paid from $1.75 to $2.00 per cord (48 to 55 cent/m³) of pit-props, using a bucksaw for 12 hours per day. They were put on rations of mostly beans and porridge and bought deteriorating food from the company store. Men had to go out hunting to obtain sufficient food for themselves and their families. Many of the non-Inuit, not accustomed to the way of life came with dreams of prosperity but soon realized that conditions were the same as the fishery. They were always in debt! Eventually forcing most of them to move back to Newfoundland.
By 30 July 1934 Police Superintendent O’Neil had investigated the complaints of the 225 lumber men and declared that there were no valid grounds for the strike although it was admitted that the preparations for the 500 men were inadequate when they arrived.
In August 1934 the first permanent settlement started at the site of a logging camp run by the Labrador Development Company and named after Sir John Hope Simpson. The first Company Town in Labrador had been born and large scale commercial development of the woods around Alexis and Lewis Bays for the export of pit props to south Wales had begun. Building development at Port Hope Simpson, by the winter of 1935, only consisted of a community hall and a hospital or seven-room medical clinic. A general store, a hall - also used as a church and a school - had also been erected at adjacent Mill Point cove.
But as early as November 1934, after Sir John Hope Simpson, who had agreed to Williams's suggestion that the settlement be named after himself, opening-up Simpson to accusations of favouritism, had returned to England over Christmas to meet with officials at the Dominion Office, it had become apparent that J. O. Williams had lost his government’s support. When the Dominion Office found out that the 400 houses were not being built at Port Hope Simpson and money had effectively been borrowed under false pretences on Simpson’s say–so it brought about a complete change in their attitude towards Simpson and Williams.
Simpson was recalled to the Dominion Office in November 1934 not on the pretence of some constitutional issue or other but to face severe reprimand for what he and Lodge had allowed to happen. He had failed spectacularly to get Williams to toe the line in repaying his debts because he feared that Williams would carry out his threat to pull out of Labrador and Newfoundland altogether. Williams, on the other hand, made no fundamental misjudgement about his economic prospects on the Labrador, because, by using borrowed government funds he proceeded to make money hand over fist from 1934–1940. By the time the Public Enquiry was held into Williams’ affairs in 1945 his personal qualities of drive and persistence had become more than a thorough nuisance, as the Dominion Office had failed to get to the bottom of what he was up to. They were aware they had been hoodwinked and John Chadwick, one of the civil servants, believed he had seen a way out of the mess via a proposed public enquiry that would enable the government to cut all ties with Williams once and for all despite the blunders of their representative, Sir John Hope Simpson.
By 29 January 1935 it was clear that the Labrador Development Company was taking maximum advantage of the fact that exploitation of the woods could happen in an unregulated way. This state of affairs carried on from 1935 to 1940. It wasn’t until after a government director was appointed to its board from 1940 and the Public Enquiry into its affairs took place in 1944 that Williams’s activities were finally controlled.
On 4 June 1935 in a very confidential letter marked “secret and personal”, Sir John Hope Simpson wrote that 200 families were being settled at the Alexis River site. Less than two weeks after Simpson wrote the above letter, the Commission of Government had supposedly taken over complete financial control of all properties in both of Williams’ companies. That Simpson had moved so quickly in making such preparations is in direct contrast to the previously supportive way in which he had dealt with the company. In a letter on 5 July 1935 to Bridges, Clutterbuck at the Dominions Office wrote that plans were in sight for a permanent settlement. Two weeks later, Simpson wrote that the loggers were earning great wages of about $3.00 per day. In fact they were only earning at the very most about $1.30 per day. By September of that year, Simpson revealed he was looking for excuses to leave the scene in Newfoundland altogether.
By the end of 1936 in Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Company had arranged for the men to build themselves about 60 small houses for rent but most Labradorians chose not to live in the company housing due to their rental costs, living instead about a quarter of a mile away on the opposite side of Black Water brook. In justification of the good works done by Williams, his counsel at the public enquiry in 1945 emphasised that the company had rendered every possible service at considerable cost to provide work for the people of Newfoundland and the needy families of Labrador. By so doing it was claimed it had adhered to the agreement made with the Commission of Government on 30 April 1934 that the government wished to do everything it could to help develop the Labrador and the company. Williams’ counsel claimed that after years of work; the company had stabilised and had built up an efficient unit of workers who took an interest in their work and their employers.
By March 1938 Williams felt that government policy towards him had steadily deteriorated and by the time of the public enquiry in 1945 he was fighting a long lost cause. Disaffection with the Labrador Development Company representatives on site quickly set in whilst J O Williams was 3,000 miles away in Britain living in luxury in Cardiff city centre next door to Eric by 15 March 1938.
In a context of suspicious and acrimonious circumstances from his loggers and their families towards The Company, in the early hours of 3 February 1940, personal tragedy hit Williams as Eric Arthur Williams, his eldest son and Erica D'Anitoff Williams his infant daughter seemed to have died in a house fire in Port Hope Simpson. The cause of their deaths is yet to be established and foul play cannot be ruled out as part of the on-going Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.)Serious Crimes Unit Investigation opened in August 2002.
The date not only marked the first time the case had been moved from The Department of Natural Resources to the Department of Justice in Canada but also marked the first time, albeit 62 years later, that an investigation into the circumstances around the deaths took place which found that somebody may well have been "stirring the pot" as the people felt betrayed by Williams.
Eric had been sent out by his Father into a most difficult situation (where the loggers and their families had been kept in the dark about what had been going-on behind the scenes) to report on the issue of unauthorized stores having been bought for the Company Store (monopoly) operation in Port Hope Simpson. Eric ordered that excess stores be returned to St. John's and went beyond his Father's instructions by entering into the Keith Younge local contract for cutting pit props to be shipped out to South Wales although at the time this arrangement was seen as a good way of helping the Company to continue its operation in the area. But it was not to be...as Eric and his daughter were quite likely unlawfully killed.
According to the original correspondence within the Public Enquiry, Keith Younge, local Labrador Development Company Limited store manager ordered that the two bodies should be quickly buried and a concrete headstone inscribed and erected. Subsequently, a granite memorial stone as first seen in 1969 The Port Hope Simpson Diaries cut from the Preseli Hills of South Wales and shipped out by Williams replaced the smaller headstone and significantly, all mention of Olga D'Anitoff Williams, Eric's wife, by order of J O Williams from back in South Wales, was removed from the final epitaph. The Public Enquiry into the Financial Affairs of The Labrador Development Limited (kept in UK National Archives) clearly shows within its original correspondence that J O Williams considered Olga to be of a "bad character."
Williams' confidential letter to Keith Yonge in 1941 in which he admitted that he had the money but wanted to get as big a concession from the government as possible before disclosing his financial strength also indicates his level of deception. It was only after Williams and the Labrador Development Company had left Port Hope Simpson in 1948 that the people could set about bettering themselves, but by this time many had moved away in search of work.
The Public Enquiry was held in St. John's, Newfoundland and reported in 1945 into the affairs of the Labrador Development Company Limited. It was engineered by a group of six civil servants at the Dominions Office who wanted to show that Williams was of unreliable character. When Chief Justice Dunfield’s report on the public enquiry came out it meant the Dominion Office’s plan to discredit Williams’ character had seriously backfired. The government wanted the report buried after local publication.
Judge Dunfield found that Williams had run out of liquid cash reserves that were essential to scale up the operations. He considered that the government was also responsible for the company and had pressed Williams to cut more timber to provide more work for the people. Dunfield knew that $19400 per annum of capital had to be re-paid to the government ($1.00 per cord (28 cent/m³) on limited production) plus the heavy interest on the government loan and that it was initially planned to cut 50000 cords (180000 m³) of timber per annum.
Dunfield’s conclusion was that neither Williams nor the government fully appreciated how much the Port Hope Simpson project would cost and so the company was under-funded right from the start. It found itself in a vicious circle where it did not have sufficient funds to expand and, without the expansion, its overheads could not be carried. Dunfield clearly implied that he was not exactly confident about the financial health of the company from the outset.
His judgment was that the government went from being a supportive partner to being a strict creditor. Then the World War II|Second World War came and stopped the free export of pit props. The people from 1934-39 received according to Dunfield, not less than $800,000 in wages when they might have been 
on the dole.
Dunfield acknowledged Williams’ particular line of skill, but thought that he was not experienced in other fields and that he himself had admitted so.
The $250,000 reinvestment Williams made in Labrador from his Newfoundland trade, coupled with the money from his Cardiff company hid the true position according to Dunfield, which was that the Labrador enterprise needed a much greater capital investment and a larger working capital than had been provided. Dunfield laid the blame firmly on Williams and said that the government was also to blame for failing to fulfil its partnership contribution in the circumstances. Dunfield thought the government lacked the right calibre of officials, with the right training to work successfully with Williams the businessperson. Dunfield went so far as to say in his final report that Williams should perhaps be given another chance.
Dunfield was in fact quite sympathetic towards Williams and definite that he was not entirely to blame for what had happened. He knew that the Government had gained more than it had lost on the venture and he would not swallow the vitriolic anti-Williams propaganda. He had found no evidence to justify the bad impression that other people and he had held before the start of the enquiry about Williams. Dunfield might have overreacted against the very suggestion that he should take part in any sort of rigged public enquiry to attack Williams’ character and discredit him. Instead, he recommended that the Government and Williams should try again.
In 1945 the population of Port Hope Simpson had been 352 which included 119 children. However, one year later from Williams’s point of view, the situation had looked desperate,
Back in Britain on the one hand, the British treasury was trying to ensure that the UK taxpayer would not have to bear any loss incurred by the company if it went into liquidation. On the other hand, it also wanted to make absolutely certain the government were not going to be liable for any claim made by Williams for special compensation. Therefore, wanting to appear generous in public, within the modified terms of their final settlement, they offered to waive the interest on their loan from 30 June 1940–20 November 1945. The export of timber from Labrador would be free of all tax from 1946–1955 inclusive and then subject to an export tax of 0.25 cents per cord (0.07 cent/m³) from 1956–1966. Royalties on cutting were not payable and Williams was offered a fresh timber contract in 1946, which he accepted.
The treasury had been consistent over the years in its unwillingness to allocate Williams any more money because of his unreliability. Nevertheless, Williams was still granted a further $100,000 loan on 15 October 1946 that included excellent terms by the British government for his last timber contract - despite the fact that about half of the final contract of wood was left behind.
By the time the contract was completed Williams had definitely made up his mind not to continue with business in Newfoundland and Labrador any longer. Despite the very generous terms he was still claiming that the evidence entitled him to a fair settlement and he had been thinking about progressing into the fishing business in the area. He was very confident that the old Labrador crowd were ready to go back to work for him. However, in a press interview on 24 December 1945, he was quoted as saying that 165 men were logging at Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador but that 572 men who had been sent there in November had refused to work and had to be brought back and 20 more had demanded repatriation. Chadwick’s view from the dominions office in the same year about the Labrador Development Company was that,
“Our aim was to end this sordid history one way or the other rather than allow matters to drift on as they have done for the past five years.”<br>—Chadwick J. 1945
The original correspondence from the Public Enquiry shows Chadwick was very eager to cut his losses from the Dominions Office’s long-running affair with Williams and in the end Williams did not make a claim for financial compensation against the British government.
In a wider political context, Williams’ efforts to keep alive the Labrador Development Company were going on when Newfoundland and Labrador were moving towards joining the Confederation of Canada in 1949. The obvious effect upon Williams was that he chose to close down his operations completely at Port Hope Simpson rather than pay federal taxes on the wood.
The affairs of the Labrador Development Company at Port Hope Simpson 1934–1949 were hushed-up because it would not have been in the public and national interest to have done otherwise. In the lead up to the Second World War, a climate of trust was vital in our political leaders. The last thing the United Kingdom and its steadfast ally Newfoundland wanted was to be distracted from the war by a relatively trifling dispute about what was going on at Port Hope Simpson. Newfoundland had already suffered from a lack of available work and the low wages of the Great Depression. It needed work for its population like never before and The Labrador Development Company appeared to be offering just that. However, the effect of the political shenanigans of Sir John Hope Simpson, John Osborn Williams, the Commission of Government and the Dominions Office upon the brave crowd of southern Inuit and transient Newfoundlanders in Port Hope Simpson was to make it impossible for them to find out what was going on behind the scenes.
Williams had borrowed the money from the Colonial Office's funds in London under false intentions. He subsequently failed to build the promised 400 houses for the loggers and their families and failed to pay them a reasonable living wage. They were held in poverty by the monopoly of the Company's store in the settlement as they were forced to live under its system of credit. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigating officer in 2003 about whether or not foul play had occurred in the early hours of 3 February 1940 stated that,
"He...Williams...betrayed the people and no doubt this would have stirred the pot enough for someone to have taken drastic measures by their own hands and started the fire at the house that led to the deaths of Eric, J.O.'s eldest son and Erica his infant daughter."<br>—21 October 2003
Thomas Lodge concluded that it had been the Secretary of State for Canada who had failed to give guidance to the commission who were a collection of individuals running their own departments. He described the commission as an experiment in dictatorship and claimed he left his post because he could no longer carry on working with people who completely failed to agree on a positive policy and because he could not convince the Secretary of State to adopt his own point of view. The Dominions Office removed Lodge from his position of commissioner early in 1937 and the publication of his book "Dictatorship in Newfoundland" in 1939 put him out of favour in London. Nevertheless, he became a government director of the Labrador Development Company in 1940. Lodge would have been well-placed to have handled the two deaths.
Claude Fraser, Sir John Hope Simpson's loyal secretary of Natural Resources had been appointed to the post of Government Director of the Labrador Development Company Limited on exactly the same day as when the deaths occurred.
Established facts about what really happened in the early hours of 3 February 1940.
On the following basis, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, R.C.M.P. Serious Crimes Unit based in St. John's, Newfoundland decided to open their own investigation in August 2002 into what had really happened in the early hours of 3 February 1940 in Port Hope Simpson: No pertinent Newfoundland Rangers Monthly Report on Living Conditions in the Port Hope Simpson district for February 1940 has been found written by Ranger Clarence Dwyer or any other Ranger from the Port Hope Simpson Detachment. No medical report from the Doctor who apparently attended to Olga at the scene of the two deaths has been found. No Death Certificates for Arthur Eric Williams and Erica D'Anitoff Williams have been found. A consistent effort had been made over the years by Sir John Hope Simpson to keep the Newfoundland Rangers under the jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Department instead of under the Department of Justice. The grave's epitaph had been changed and apparent evidence discrepancies exist within its content. Unsatisfactory, unpaid wages and a severe lack of houses for the loggers and their families existed for the early settlers and contributed to suspicious, acrimonious circumstances surrounding the two deaths. A lack of local knowledge existed in 1969-70 about what had been going-on during the early years of the pioneer logging camp. There was no Government Director on the Company's board in St. John's at the time the deaths occurred. The Government appointments of Claude Fraser and Thomas Lodge to the Company's Board of Directors were meant to 'keep a lid' on things. The family tradition of secrecy surrounding the two deaths also strongly suggests it is beyond coincidence that a cover-up involving at the very least, Government mismanagement continues to hide the truth about what really happened in the early hours of 3 February 1940.

The Regal Musical Instrument Company was established in 1908 in Chicago. By the 1930s, they were one of the largest manufacturers of musical instruments in the world. 
Regal specialised in:
Regal was heavily involved in the production of resonator guitars from their first development until 1941, manufacturing components and bodies for both the National String Instrument Corporation and the Dobro Manufacturing Company and producing whole instruments which sold under many brand names including "Dobro". The bodies of their plywood bellied student guitars were particularly suited to resonator conversion. 
Production of resonator guitars ceased in 1941, and of all fretted instruments in 1954. However, in 1965, Fender were distributing five models of banjo under the "Regal" name, and claimed to be the "exclusive distributors". 
In 1987 the "Regal" name and trademark reappeared as a brand of Saga Musical Instruments. they were notable for their 4-string bass resonator guitars, as well as a wide variety of more traditional resonator models.

Minor Amendments were insignificant variation in a detail and details of an Planning permission which would not raise any new issues which would warrant the submission of a fresh Planning application.
They would allow for small changes to be made often as a result of modifications arising for practical reasons during the course of construction.
Many local authorities had established protocols for dealing with such amendments.
The legal basis upon which this is allowed has recently been challenged in Case law.

Pontifical Oriental Institute

The Pontifical Oriental Institute ("Pontificium Institutum Orientalium" in Latin, "Pontificio Instituto Orientale" in Italian) is the premier center for the study of Eastern Christianity in Rome, Italy.
The pontifical school was established in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV. Pope Pius XI entrusted the Institute to the Society of Jesus in 1922, and with the 1928 encyclical "Rerum Orientalium", encouraged bishops to send students to the Institute to be formed as future professors in Oriental studies. In that same year, Pius XI associated the Institute with the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblical Institute, thus forming the Gregorian Consortium. 
In 1971, the Faculty of Oriental Canon Law was erected alongside the already existing Faculty of Oriental Ecclesiastical Studies. The Faculty of Oriental Canon Law had a crucial role in the production of Code of Canon Law for the Oriental Churches.
Since 1993, the Grand Chancellor of the Oriental Institute has been the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. The current Chancellor is Cardinal Leonardo Sandri. The current Rector of the Institute is the Reverend Father James McCann, S.J.
The Institute maintains an important library of Christian oriental literature. One special holding is a rare collection of Old Slavonic manuscripts.
The Institute has been located across from the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore since 1926. It is separated from the Collegium Russicum by the Church of Saint Antony.
According to article 16 of the Lateran Treaty, signed in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See, the property of the Oriental Institute enjoys a certain level of extraterritoriality, with the Holy See having all rights over the infrastructure without interference from the Italian State, and free from all Italian taxation.
The Institute is a member of the Gregorian Consortium.
In spoken language, the school is sometimes simply referred to as "The Orientale".

Martín Prado

Martín Manuel Prado (born October 27, 1983) is a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He plays in Major League Baseball for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Prado was traded to Arizona in January 2013. Prior to the trade, he was a member of the Atlanta Braves from 2006–2012. During his time with the Braves, Prado played in the 2010 All-Star Game. Prado has played primarily in left field and third base, although he has experience at shortstop, second base, first base and right field.
Career.
2006.
Prado made his major league debut on April 23, 2006, going 1 for 2 and logging a triple. He was later sent down to the Triple-A Richmond Braves, but was called back up to the majors later in the season. He hit his first career home run on September 14, 2006, against Jamie Moyer of the Philadelphia Phillies.
2007.
Prado was called up for the 2007 season on May 20 and was sent down on June 2. He was called up again on August 7. He was sent down on August 22 to make room for the recently activated Edgar Rentería, but Renterîa was injured in his first at bat. Prado was called up to stay on September 4.
In the 9th inning of the September 12, 2007, game against the New York Mets, Prado hit a ball in play and, upon dropping his bat to head towards first base, the bat stood perfectly upright. SportsNet New York commentator Keith Hernandez described the incident as one "that would never happen in a hundred years."
2009.
During the 2009 season, Prado stepped in as the Braves' starter at second base when Kelly Johnson went on the disabled list midway through the season. Prado took full advantage of the opportunity, to the extent that he remained the starter at second, batting second in the lineup, even after Johnson's return to the active roster. Prado's final stats for the season consisted of a .307 average, 14 home runs, 49 RBIs, and 64 runs scored in 450 at-bats over the course of 128 games. In addition to playing 63 games at second, he showed versatility by playing 41 games at third and 28 at first.
2010.
Prado made a huge statement in his career on May 10, 2010, against the Milwaukee Brewers in which he hit a grand slam against Brewers pitcher, Manny Parra. Over the course of the season, he was moved from the No. 2 spot in the batting order to the leadoff spot to take advantage of his high batting average.
Prado told reporters that he lost 14 pounds during the 2010 off-season doing the P90X fitness program, and is starting spring training stronger and "more agile."
On July 8, 2010, Prado led the Major Leagues in hits with 121 and led the NL with a .325 Batting Average. He was selected to the 2010 All-Star Game as a reserve, and started in place of Chase Utley. In late September, Prado suffered from a hip pointer, and an MRI revealed that he had a torn external oblique, causing him to miss the remainder of the season and the playoffs.
2011.
In the 2010–11 off-season the Braves acquired former Florida Marlins starting second baseman Dan Uggla in a trade for Omar Infante and reliever Mike Dunn. Although the trade was widely praised, it left the Braves in a conundrum as they now had two All Star starting second basemen on the roster. Prado was approached about moving to left field, which he did without any public complaint. On May 13, 2011, in a game versus the Washington Nationals in which the Braves were trailing 5–1 in the 7th inning, Prado notched his second career grand slam after a 10-pitch duel with Nationals reliever Sean Burnett, putting the Braves on course to win 6–5 in the 10th inning.
On July 26, 2011 in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates that ended with a controversial call on a play at home plate, Prado went 0-for-9 and left eight men on base. He was on deck when the game ended.
Prado was treated for a staph infection in his right calf and placed on the 15-day DL on June 10, 2011. He returned from the disabled list on July 15, going 2–5 with a home run in his first game back.
2013.
After the 2012 season, the Braves traded Prado with Randall Delgado, Nick Ahmed, Zeke Spruill and Brandon Drury to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Justin Upton and Chris Johnson. On January 31, the Diamondbacks and Prado agreed on a 4-year, $40 million extension.

<doc id="4877967" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4877967" title="Shankha">
Shankha

Shankha ( "Śaṇkha," pronounced ) is a conch shell which is of ritual and religious importance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The shankha is the shell of a species of large predatory sea snail, "Turbinella pyrum", which lives in the Indian Ocean.
In Hinduism, the shankha is a sacred emblem of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu. It is still used as a trumpet in Hindu ritual, and in the past was used as a war trumpet. The shankha is praised in Hindu scriptures as a giver of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin and the abode of Lakshmi, who is the goddess of wealth and consort of Vishnu.
The shankha is displayed in Hindu art in association with Vishnu. As a symbol of water, it is associated with female fertility and serpents (Nāgas). The shankha is the state emblem of the Indian state of Kerala and was also the national emblems of the Indian princely state of Travancore, and the Kingdom of Kochi.
The shankha is one of the eight Buddhist auspicious symbols, the Ashtamangala, and in Buddhism it represents the pervasive sound of the Buddhadharma. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is known as "dung kar".
A powder made from the shell material is used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine, primarily as a cure for stomach ailments and for increasing beauty and strength.
In the Western world, in the English language, the shell of this species is known as the "divine conch" or the "sacred chank". It may also be simply called a "chank" or conch. The more common form of this shell is known as "left-turning" in a religious context, although scientists would call it "dextral". A very rarely encountered form has reverse coiling which is called "right-turning" in a religious context, but is known as "sinistral" or left-coiling in a scientific context.
Regional names.
The word shankha is spelled differently in India from one region to another, according to the language used there. It is spelled "Shankha" in Sanskrit, Kannada and Marathi. In English, it is usually known as a conch or conch shell, but also as a "chank" shell. In Gujarati, it is known as "du-sukk", as "sanka" and "chanku" in Tamil, "senkham" in Telugu, "sankha" in Oriya and "shankho" in Bengali.
Characteristics.
This shell is from a sea snail species "Turbinella pyrum" in the family Turbinellidae. This species is found living in the Indian Ocean and surrounding seas. The shell is porcelaneous (i.e. the surface of the shell is strong, hard, shiny, and somewhat translucent, like porcelain).
The overall shape of the main body of the shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has a protuberance in the middle, but tapers at each end. The upper portion (the siphonal canal) is corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end (the spire) is twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull, and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent. Like all snail shells, the interior is hollow. The inner surfaces of the shell are very shiny, but the outer surface exhibits high tuberculation. In Hinduism, the shiny, white, soft shankha with pointed ends and heavy is the most sought after.
Types.
Based on its direction of coiling, the shankha has two varieties:
In Hinduism, a "Dakshinavarta shankha" symbolizes infinite space and is associated with Vishnu. The "Vamavarta shankha" represents the reversal of the laws of nature and is linked with Shiva.
"Dakshinavarta shankha" is believed to be the abode of the wealth goddess Lakshmi - the consort of Vishnu, and hence this type of shankha is considered ideal for medicinal use. It is a very rare variety from the Indian Ocean. This type of shankha has three to seven ridges visible on the edge of the aperture and on the columella and has a special internal structure. The right spiral of this type reflects the motion of the planets. It is also compared with the hair whorls on the Buddha's head that spiral to the right. The long white curl between Buddha's eyebrows and the conch-like swirl of his navel are also akin to this shankha.
The "Varaha Purana" tells that bathing with the "Dakshinavarta shankha" frees one from sin. Skanda Purana narrates that bathing Vishnu with this shankha grants freedom from sins of seven previous lives. A "Dakshinavarta shankha "is considered to be a rare "jewel" or "ratna" and is adorned with great virtues. It is also believed to grant longevity, fame and wealth proportional to its shine, whiteness and largeness. Even if such a shankha has a defect, mounting it in gold is believed to restore the virtues of the shankha.
Uses.
In its earliest references, shankha is mentioned as a trumpet and in this form it became an emblem of Vishnu. Simultaneously, it was used as a votive offering and as a charm to keep away the dangers of the sea. It was the earliest known sound-producing agency as manifestation of sound, and the other elements came later, hence it is regarded as the original of the elements. It is identified with the elements themselves.
As a trumpet or wind instrument, a hole is drilled near the tip of the apex of the shankha. When air is blown through this hole, it travels through the whorls of the shankha, producing a loud, sharp, shrill sound. This sound is the reason the shankha was used as a war trumpet, to summon helpers and friends. Shanka continued to be used in battles for a long time. The sound it produced was called "shankanad".
Nowadays, the shankha is blown at the time of worship in Hindu temples and homes, especially in the ritual of the Hindu "aarti", when light is offered to the deities. The shankha is also used to bathe images of deities, especially Vishnu, and for ritual purification. No hole is drilled for these purposes, though the aperture is cut clean or rarely the whorls are cut to represent five consecutive shells with five mouths.
Shankha is used as a material for making bangles, bracelets and other objects. Due to its aquatic origin and resemblance to the vulva, it has become an integral part of the Tantric rites. In view of this, its symbolism is also said to represent female fertility. Since water itself is a fertility symbol, shankha, which is an aquatic product is recognised as symbolic of female fertility. In ancient Greece, shells, along with pearls, are mentioned as denoting sexual love and marriage, and also mother goddesses.
Different magic and sorcery items are also closely connected with this trumpet. This type of device existed long before the Buddhist era.
Ayurvedic medicine.
Shankha is used in Ayurvedic medicinal formulations to treat many ailments. It is prepared as conch shell ash, known in Sanskrit as "shankha bhasma", which is prepared by soaking the shell in lime juice and calcinating in covered crucibles, 10 to 12 times, and finally reducing it to powder ash. Shankha bhasma contains calcium, iron and magnesium and is considered to possess antacid and digestive properties.
A compound pill called "shankavati" is also prepared for use in dyspepsia. In this case, the procedure followed is to mix "shankha bhasma" with tamarind seed ash, five salts (panchlavana), asafoetida, ammonium chloride, pepper, carui, caraway, ginger, long pepper, purified mercury and aconite in specified proportions. It is then triturated in juices of lemon and made into a pill-mass. It is prescribed for "vata" (wind/air) and "pitta" (bile) ailments, as well as for beauty and strength.
Significance.
Shankha's significance is traced to the nomadic times of the animists who used the sound emanating from this unique shell to drive away evil demons of whom they were scared. The same is still believed in Hinduism. Over the centuries, the shankha was adopted as one of the divine symbols of Hinduism.
The sound of the shankha symbolises the sacred "Om" sound. Vishnu holding the conch represents him as the god of sound. Brahma Vaivarta Purana declares that shankha is the residence of both Lakshmi and Vishnu, bathing by the waters led through a shankha is considered as like bathing with all holy waters at once. Sankha Sadma Purana declares that bathing an image of Vishnu with cow milk is as virtuous as performing a million "yajnas" (fire sacrifices), and bathing Vishnu with Ganges river water frees one from the cycle of births. It further says "while the mere sight of the conch (shankha) dispels all sins as the Sun dispels the fog, why talk of its worship?" Padma Purana asserts the same effect of bathing Vishnu by Ganges water and milk and further adds doing so avoids evil, pouring water from a shankha on one's own head before a Vishnu image is equivalent to bathing in the pious Ganges river.
Even in Buddhism, the conch shell has been incorporated as one of the eight auspicious symbols, also called "Ashtamangala". The right-turning white conch shell (), represents the elegant, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of the Buddhadharma, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.
Shankha was the Royal State Emblem of Travancore and also figured on the Royal Flag of the Jaffna Kingdom. It is also the election symbol of the Indian political party Biju Janata Dal.
In Hindu iconography and art.
Shankha is one of the main attributes of Vishnu. Vishnu's images, either in sitting or standing posture, show him holding the shankha usually in his left upper hand, while "Sudarshana Chakra" ("chakra" - discus), "gada" (mace) and "padma" (lotus flower) decorate his upper right, the lower left and lower right hands, respectively.
Avatars of Vishnu like Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narasimha are also depicted holding the shankha, along with the other attributes of Vishnu. Krishna - avatar of Vishnu is described possessing a shankha called Panchajanya. Regional Vishnu forms like Jagannath and Vithoba may be also pictured holding the shankha. Besides Vishnu, other deities are also pictured holding the shankha. These include the sun god Surya, Indra - the king of heaven and god of rain the war god Murugan (Skanda), the goddess Vaishnavi and the warrior goddess Durga. Similarly, Gaja Lakshmi statues show Lakshmi holding a shankha in the right hand and lotus on the other.
Sometimes, the shankha of Vishnu is personified as "ayudha-purusha" ("weapon-man") in the sculpture and depicted as a man standing beside Vishnu or his avatars. This subordinate figure is called the "Shankha-purusha" who is depicted holding a shankha in both the hands. Temple pillars, walls, gopuras (towers), basements and elsewhere in the temple, sculpted depictions of the shankha and chakra - the emblems of Vishnu - are seen. The city of Puri also known as Shankha-kshetra is sometimes pictured as a shankha or conch in art with the Jagannath temple at its centre.
Shaligrama or Shalagrama stones are iconographic fossil stones, particularly found in Gandaki River in Nepal, which are worshipped by Hindus as representative of Vishnu. Hence, a shaligrama - which has the marks of a shanka, chakra, gada and padma arranged in this particular order – is worshipped as Keshava. Twenty four orders of the four symbols defined for Shaligrama are also followed in worship of images of Vishnu with different names. Out of these, besides Keshava the four names of images worshipped starting with Shankha on the upper hand, are: Madhusudana, Damodara, Samkarshana and Upendra.
In Hindu legend.
A Hindu legend in Brahma Vaivarta Purana recalls the creation of conchs: god Shiva flung a trident towards the demons, burning them instantaneously. Their ashes flew in the sea creating conchs. Shankha is believed to be a brother of Lakshmi as both of them were born from the sea. A legend describes a demon named Shankhasura (conch-demon), who was killed by Vishnu's fish Avatar – Matsya.
In the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata, the symbol of Shankha is widely adopted. In the Ramayana epic, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna are considered as part-incarnations of Sheshanaga, Sudarshana Chakra and Shankha, respectively, while Rama, their eldest brother, is considered as one of the ten Avatars of shri Vishnu.
During the great Mahabharata war, Krishna, as the charioteer of the Pandava prince and a protagonist of the epic - Arjuna - resounds the Panchajanya to declare war. Panchajanya in Sanskrit means 'having control over the five classes of beings'. All five Pandava brothers are described having their own shankhas. Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva are described to possess shankhas named Ananta-Vijaya, Poundra-Khadga, Devadatta, Sughosha and Mani-pushpaka, respectively.
Due to the association of the shankha with water, serpents (Nāga) are named after the shankha. The list of Nāgas in the Mahabharata, Harivamsha and Bhagavat Purana includes names like Shankha, Mahashankha, Shankhapala and Shankachuda. The last two are also mentioned in Buddhist stories of Jataka Tales and Jimutavahana. A legend narrates: while using Shankha as part of meditative ritual, a sadhu blew his shankha in the forest of village Keoli and a snake crept out of it. The snake directed the sadhu that he should be worshipped as Nāga Devata (Serpent god) and since then it has been known as Shanku Naga. Similar legends are narrated at many other places in Kullu district in Himachal Pradesh.

Mani Lal Bhaumik

Mani Lal Bhaumik is an Indian-born American physicist and a bestselling author.
Early life.
Bhaumik was born in a small village in Siuri, Medinipore, West Bengal, India, and thrust into the vortex of the struggle for Indian independence. Education provided him a way out of poverty. He walked four miles barefoot to the nearest school, Kola Union High School, and endured famine, flood, and armed threat. As an impressionable teenager, Bhaumik was privileged to spend some time with Mahatma Gandhi in his Mahisadal camp. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Scottish Church College and an M. Sc. from the University of Calcutta. He won the attention of Satyendra Nath Bose (creator of the Bose–Einstein statistics) who encouraged his prodigious curiosity. Bhaumik became the first student to receive Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in history when he received his Ph.D. in quantum physics in 1958. His thesis was on Resonant Electronic Energy Transfers, a subject he would have cause to use in his work with lasers.
Scientific career.
Receiving a Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 1959, Dr. Bhaumik came to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) for post doctoral studies. In 1961, he joined the Quantum Electronics Division at Xerox Electro-Optical Systems in Pasadena and began his career as a laser scientist. Concurrently, he taught Quantum physics and Astronomy at the California State University at Long Beach. In 1968, he was enlisted by the Northrop Corporate Research Laboratory, where he rose to become the director of the Laser Technology Laboratory and led a team that made contributions in research on excimer laser technology. One of the papers on this research was presented at the Denver, Colorado meeting of the Optical Society of America in May 1973. At this meeting, Dr. Bhaumik presented substantial evidence to demonstrate for the first time that an excimer laser could be efficient and powerful enough for practical utilization. The application of excimer lasers in Lasik eye surgery has resulted in vision correction in many cases. His significant contributions to the development of new and high power lasers merited his election by his peers to be a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
Dr. Bhaumik's current interest is in sharing with the public the astounding advances in quantum physics and cosmology and their implications for our lives, work, technology, and spiritual development. This he endeavors to do through books such as the internationally published "Code Name God" and "The Cosmic Detective", articles, lectures, and TV programs like the award-winning Cosmic Quantum Ray. He is also keenly interested in research on the origin and the nature of consciousness and how that knowledge can be utilised in improving the quality of our existence.
Dr. Bhaumik has published over fifty papers in various professional journals and is a holder of a dozen laser-related U.S. patents. His latest paper, "Unified Field—the Universal Blueprint?" appeared in the February 2000 issue of the "International Journal of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences". He has been invited to lecture all over the world, at forums including: Summer School on High-Power Gas Lasers, Capri, Italy 1975; International Symposium on Gas-Flow and Chemical Lasers, Belgium 1978; International Symposium on Gas Discharge Lasers, Grenoble, France 1979; Asoke Sarkar Memorial Lecture, Calcutta International Book Fair 2001; Institute of Culture, Calcutta, India 2006.
He is the official patron of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA).
Books, media, and philanthropic activities.
Dr. Bhaumik utilized the earnings from his scientific career to seed various investments and was able to leave the poverty of his childhood behind. His life was chronicled on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Later he discovered that spirituality is an essential ingredient for an abiding happiness and turned to the study of the relationship between advanced science and spirituality.
His intensive search spanned a decade, produced a number of significant papers, and led him to the inference that the One Source at the hub of all spiritual traditions is grounded in scientific reality and not a mere creation of blind faith. He also argues forcefully that contrary to the popular misconception, science and spirituality are indeed two sides of the same coin, the coin being that unique human consciousness that allows us to perceive both ourselves and objective reality. Therefore, he argues in his book "Code Name God" (Crossroads Publishing), the big divide between science and spirituality can be bridged. The trick, Bhaumik asserts, is to see things in an entirely new light–a light shed upon by the recent revelations of quantum physics and cosmology. He now devotes much of his time and energy to bringing this message to the public, including its younger members, for whom he has recently published The Cosmic Detective (Penguin 2008), a primer on cosmology, and created an award winning animated television series, Quantum Ray, shown on the HUB channel, reaching 60 million homes in USA and distributed worldwide.
Dr. Bhaumik has instituted an annual International Award through the UCLA Neuropsychiatry Institute to acknowledge the best scientific evidence demonstrating the effect of mind in healing. He has been involved in numerous community activities through his association with the Los Angeles Bombay Sister City Association; the Los Angeles St. Petersburg Sister City association; the Long Beach Calcutta sister City Association and others. He has donated to various charitable organizations including the Thalians of Los Angeles. But he is perhaps best known and revered internationally for his creation of the Bhaumik Educational Foundation, based in Kolkata, which provides full scholarships to needy but brilliant students who wish to apply themselves to studies in science and technology.
Spiritual views.
Code Name: God.
First published in the U.S. in 2005, Code Name God (Crossroads Publishing ISBN 0-8245-2519-1 ) is a distillation of Dr. Bhaumik's central thesis that the discoveries of modern physics can be reconciled with the great truths of the world religions when those truths are viewed as elements of what Aldous Huxley called "The Perennial Philosophy." In particular, Dr. Bhaumik finds strong support in advanced physics and cosmology for the Neo-Platonic notion of "the One" (identified here as "The Source"), and conjectures that this existential source may reside in what is known as the quantum vacuum state and be in some manner co-eternal and co-equal with human consciousness. The book and its premise have been praised by luminaries of both the literary and scientific words, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote, "This example of a personal spiritual growth...and re-evaluation of material values...arouses very warm feelings. God is one and there are no major differences between religions." Fritjof Capra, author of The Tao of Physics, wrote "...the attempt to find common ground between Eastern spirituality and Western science is eloquently told and makes for fascinating reading."
Code Name God is both an autobiography, chronicling significant events in its author's life in tandem with the revelations that accompanied them, and a contemplation on the astounding implications of quantum physics. In the author's words, "the surprising discovery of quantum physics that the primary source of everything in the universe is present in each minutest stitch of the fabric of space of this immensely vast cosmos empowers us to ponder the One Source of all creation. It is not merely a blind faith anymore. This ought to enable us to feel ourselves as an inextricable part of the One Source, which would significantly improve the quality of our lives." The book, which has enjoyed considerable success in Bhaumik's native India, has also drawn plaudits from recognized European scientists such as Professor Walter Thirring, the former director and head of the theory division at CERN, Geneva, who asserts in the foreword to its German edition, "Dr. Bhaumik’s portrayal of a higher power embedded in the fabric of the universe and responsible for its continuing existence and operation is consistent with his reliance on the highly technical and mathematical intricacies of the Quantum Field Theory, an area of study to which I had the opportunity of making some significant contributions." Thirring and Bhaumik are among a still relatively small group of "hard scientists" who have openly acknowledged the spiritual implications of quantum physics and cosmology.
The Cosmic Detective.
Published in 2009 by Penguin (ISBN 9780143330691), The Cosmic Detective is a primer on modern cosmology for the general but scientifically inclined reader. It was selected as an official book by the secretariat of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) declared by the UN General Assembly. The slogan of IYA2009 was “THE UNIVERSE -YOURS TO DISCOVER,” an exhortation for us to reevaluate our place in it in light of the revolutionary discoveries of modern cosmology. The presentation of the discoveries of modern cosmology in this book has been praised by experts as well as others interested in the field. Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, President of the International Astronomical Union states,”The Cosmic Detective is an inspirational read. Dr. Bhaumik tackles topics with impressive scope, yet delves into them with spirit rarely seen. Marrying scientifically accurate text with accessible language is no easy task, but The Cosmic Detective is a proof that it can be done.” Dr. Walter Thirring, the former head of the theory division at CERN, Geneva, has said, ”The Cosmic Detective reveals another of Mani Bhaumik’s talents: he is an outstanding science writer to complement his demonstrated scientific insight. He has the unique ability to distill from the voluminous material the essential concepts for the general public.” Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, in his foreword to the book, writes, “Mani Bhaumik builds on recent developments in science to bring us new pictures, larger views and insights about the magnificence of our universe.” The book has been published in seven different languages throughout the world.

The Artist and Journal of Home Culture

The Artist and Journal of Home Culture, also The Artist, was a monthly art and design journal published in London by Archibald Constable & Co. from 1880 to 1902. From 1881 to 1894 the full title was The Artist and Journal of Home Culture. From 1896 the full title became The Artist: An Illustrated Monthly Record of Arts, Crafts and Industries. An American edition was published in New York by Truslove, Hanson & Comba.
Under the editorship of Charles Kains Jackson, 1888-1894, "The Artist and Journal of Home Culture" contained a notable undercurrent of homoeroticism and had some importance in the homosexual subculture without being so overt as to alienate its mainstream readership.

Bloomington Jefferson High School

"For schools with a similar name, see Jefferson High School (disambiguation)."
Thomas Jefferson Senior High School is one of the two high schools in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA Independent School District No. 271. It is located on at 102nd Street and France Avenue on the suburb's southwest side. About 1,600 students attend in grades 9 through 12. The mascot is a Jaguar. 
Jefferson was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the US Department of Education in 2009, although the school has had a solid academic reputation among in the state for some time. 
After many years in the Lake Conference, in 2010 both Bloomington Jefferson and Bloomington Kennedy High schools became founding members of the South Suburban Conference sponsored by the Minnesota State High School League. League activities include athletics, academic teams, drama, and music. The other high school, John F. Kennedy located at 98th Street and Nicollet Avenue, and Jefferson are bitter cross town rivals.
Athletics.
Bloomington Jefferson was part of the Lake Conference in the Minnesota State High School League. The 2000-2001 boys hockey team is the subject of the 2003 book "Blades of Glory" by John Rosengren. The school had been a member of the Lake Conference since the school opened. The school has left the Lake Conference to become part of the new South Suburban Conference. In 2014 the school will leave the South Suburban Conference to join the new Metro West Conference.
Construction and original curriculum.
Bloomington Jefferson High School was constructed to support a new curriculum offering. This curriculum used a Modular Scheduling approach to scheduling, based loosely on a lecture attendance and test attendance policy. Students were required to attend a certain number of class lectures a week, as well as test-times. 
This approach called for a number of large 'lecture hall' type rooms, which could be subdivided if necessary. 
Due to community outcry, the 'mod' approach was cancelled, beginning with the 1979-1980 school year, leaving a school ill-constructed for a more traditional subject-based classroom. In response, many of the large rooms were repartitioned into smaller class-rooms with thin, somewhat flexible walls. These walls did not block noise well, but created a perception of smaller classrooms, and were in use at least until the late 1990s. 
Many of the teachers who came to Jefferson on its inception to be part of the new curriculum stayed on as it transitioned to a more traditional approach.
In 2011-2012 Jefferson switched from a traditional block schedule to a new 6 period schedule on Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and 3 periods on Wednesday, and Thursday. This new schedule offers students the opportunity to take early bird classes that commence before school starts, 6:50-7:41.

Dalfi d'Alvernha

Dalfi d'Alvernha () was the Count of Clermont and Montferrand, a troubadour and a patron of troubadours. He was born around 1150 and died in 1234 or 1235. He is sometimes called Robert IV, but there is no solid evidence for the name Robert, and the name can cause confusion, since his first cousin once removed was Robert IV, Count of Auvergne, who died in 1194.
Dalfi d'Alvernha was the son of William VII the Young of Auvergne, Count of Clermont, and of Jeanne de . He married Guillemette de Comborn, countess of Montferrand, daughter of Archambaud, viscount of Comborn, and Jourdaine of Périgord. Their children were Aélis, Guillaume (William, later count of Clermont), Blanche and Alix.
Troubadours who worked with Dalfi or sang at his court include Peirol, Perdigon, Peire de Maensac, Gaucelm Faidit, and Uc de Saint Circ; his cousin, bishop Robert of Clermont, exchanged satirical and erotic verses with him, as did Richard Coeur de Lion. One "partimen" between Dauphin and Perdigon marks a stage in the poetical debate, begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and taken up by Azalais de Porcairagues and Raimbaut of Orange, as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. A "tensó" on the same subject was composed by Guiraut de Bornelh and king Alfonso II of Aragon.

Gabor transform

The Gabor transform, named after Dennis Gabor, is a special case of the short-time Fourier transform. It is used to determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time. The function to be transformed is first multiplied by a Gaussian function, which can be regarded as a window function, and the resulting function is then transformed with a Fourier transform to derive the time-frequency analysis. The window function means that the signal near the time being analyzed will have higher weight. The Gabor transform of a signal x(t) is defined by this formula:
The Gaussian function has infinite range and it is impractical for implementation. However, a level of significance can be chosen (for instance 0.00001) for the distribution of the Gaussian function. 
Outside these limits of integration formula_3, the Gaussian function is small enough to be ignored. Thus the Gabor transform can be satisfactorily approximated as
This simplification makes the Gabor transform practical and realizable.
The window function width can also be varied to optimize the time-frequency resolution tradeoff for a particular application by replacing the formula_5 with formula_6 for some chosen alpha.
Inverse Gabor transform.
The Gabor transform is invertible. The original signal can be recovered by the following equation
Compare this inversion formula with property No. 5 below.
Properties of the Gabor transform.
The Gabor transform has many properties like those of the Fourier transform. These properties are listed in the following tables.
Application and example.
The main application of the Gabor transform is used in time frequency analysis. Take the following equation as an example. The input signal has 1Hz frequency component when "t" ≤ 0 and has 2Hz frequency component when "t" > 0
But if the total bandwidth available is 5Hz, other frequency bands except "x"("t") are wasted. Through time frequency analysis by applying the Gabor transform, the available bandwidth can be known and those frequency bands can be used for other applications and bandwidth is saved. The right side picture show the input signal "x"("t") and the output of the Gabor transform. As was our expectation, the frequency distribution can be separated into two parts. One is "t" ≤ 0 and the other is "t" > 0. The white part is the frequency band occupied by "x"("t") and the black part is not used.
Discrete Gabor-transformation.
A discrete version of Gabor representation
with formula_10
can be derived easily by discretizing the Gabor-basis-function in these equations. Hereby the continuous parameter t is replaced by the discrete time k. Furthermore the now finite summation limit in Gabor representation has to be considered. In this way, the sampled signal y(k) is split into M time frames of length N. According to formula_11, the factor Ω for critical sampling is formula_12
Similar to the DFT (discrete Fourier transformation) a frequency domain split into N discrete partitions is obtained. An inverse transformation of these N spectral partitions then leads to N values y(k)for the time window, which consists of N sample values. For overall M time windows with N sample values, each signal y(k) contains K=N formula_13 M sample values: (the discrete Gabor representation)
with formula_15
According to the equation above, the Nformula_13M coefficients formula_17 correspond to the number of sample values K of the signal.
For over-sampling formula_18 is set to formula_19 with N' > N, which results in N' > N summation coefficients in the second sum of the discrete Gabor representation. In this case, the number of obtained Gabor-coefficients would be Mformula_13N'>K. Hence, more coefficients than sample values are available and therefore a redundant representation would be achieved.

Do the Strand

"Do the Strand" is the first song from Roxy Music's second album, "For Your Pleasure". In contrast to the songs from Roxy Music's eponymous debut album, this song starts suddenly without any instrumental fanfare.
Lyrics.
The song tries to convince the listener to do "The Strand", which refers to the advert for Strand cigarettes and its moody advert. The lyrics include, as is typical for early Roxy Music lyrics, art references, including The Sphinx, Mona Lisa, Lolita and Guernica.
The song gives no instructions on how The Strand should be danced, but the advert was famous for presenting a lonesome image, and it is likely that the band had no specific dance in mind. Simon Puxley wrote in 1973 that the dance was "indefinable," and best thought of as "where it's at, whatever turns you on. The buzz, the action, the centre, the quintessence, the energy." There was a dance in the 1950s known as The Strand and referenced in Maureen Gray's song "Dancing the Strand," although this is most likely coincidental.
Single.
"Do the Strand" was released as a single in 1973 in some countries (but not the UK). It was released as a single in the UK in 1978 to promote Roxy Music's "Greatest Hits" album, but it failed to chart. Despite this, the song remains one of the most popular amongst Roxy Music fans, especially at live concerts.
Covers.
The German synthpop band, Alphaville, recorded a cover version of "Do the Strand" for their 2003 album, "CrazyShow".
The American pop band Scissor Sisters recorded another cover version of "Do the Strand" for the War Child charity's 2009 charity album "War Child Presents Heroes".
