Menzies Government (1949–66)

The Premiership of Robert Menzies refers to the period of federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Robert Menzies. It was made up of members of a Liberal Party of Australia-Country Party of Australia coalition in the Australian Parliament from 1949–1966. Menzies led the Liberal-Country Coalition to election victories in 1949, 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961 and 1963. Robert Menzies was Australia's longest serving Prime Minister. Robert Menzies had served a previous term as Prime Minister as leader of the United Australia Party from 1939–1941.
Background.
United Australia Party.
The United Australia Party had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader and John Latham, hitherto leader of the Nationalist Party of Australia as his deputy. The stance of Lyons and another former Labor minister, James Fenton, against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. In March 1931, though still a member of the ALP, Lyons supported a no confidence motion against the Scullin Labor government and the UAP was formed from a coalition of citizens’ groups and with the support of the Nationalist Party. In November 1931, Lang Labor dissidents chose to challenge the Scullin Labor government and align with the UAP to pass a ‘no confidence’ and the government fell.
With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed United Australia Party won a landslide victory at the 19 December 1931 Election, and the UAP commenced its first term in government in January 1932. The Lyons Government won three consecutive elections, pursuing a conservative fiscal policy of balanced budgets and debt reduction, while stewarding Australia out of the Depression.
Lyons death in April 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of World War II. After a decade in office, the party had declined in popularity, and faced the demands of war in a shaky coalition with the Country Party. Forced to rely on the support of independents following the 1940 election, Menzies resigned in 1941, whereupon the UAP was unable to replace him with a suitable leader and allowed the leader of the junior coalition party, Arthur Fadden to take office. The Fadden Government lasted just 40 days, before the independents crossed the floor bringing Labor's John Curtin to the Prime Ministership just prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War.
Labor's John Curtin proved a popular war time leader and the Curtin Government won in a landslide in the 1943 election. In the aftermath of this defeat, the UAP began to disintegrate, and Australian conservatives and anti-socialist liberals looked to form a new political movement to counter the Australian Labor Party.
Foundation of Liberal Party.
Fourteen political parties had allied to form the United Australia Party, but disenchantment with the United Australia Party was now widespread. A group of New South Wales members had formed the new "Democratic Party". This new group looked to Robert Menzies to provide leadership. Menzies called a conference of conservative parties and other groups opposed to the ruling Australian Labor Party which met in Canberra on 13 October 1944, and again in Albury in December 1944. The formation of the party was formally announced at Sydney Town Hall on 31 August 1945.
Menzies had served as Prime Minister as leader of the United Australia Party from 1939–1941. From 1942 onward, Menzies had maintained his public profile with his series of "Forgotten People" radio talks, similar to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s "fireside chats" of the 1930s, in which he spoke of the middle class as the "backbone of Australia" but as nevertheless having been "taken for granted" by political parties and of being effectively powerless because of lack of wealth on the one hand, and lack of organization on the other.
Outlining his vision for a new political movement in 1944, Menzies said:
Menzies wanted the new party to be independent of interest groups like big business and so sought to organise a structure under which the Party would only receive money from individuals in small amounts, rather than from trade groups or associations.
After only modest gains against Labor at the 1946 election, Menzies saw out another three years as opposition leader - opposing Labor's efforts to nationalise Australia's banks, criticizing petrol rationing and speaking out against Communism in the early stages of the Cold War. Menzies characterized the incumbent Chifley Government as "socialist". With Arthur Fadden of the Country Party as his deputy, Menzies led the Liberal-Country Party Coalition to victory at the 1949 election. He was now to become the longest serving prime minister in Australian history.
Terms in office.
Following victory in the 1949 election, the Menzies Government secured a double dissolution election for 28 April 1951, after the Australian Labor Party-controlled Senate refused to pass the Menzies' banking legislation. The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with a reduced majority in the Lower House, but with control of the Senate. The Government was returned in the aftermath of the Petrov affair in the 1954 election and again after the formation of the anti-Communist Democratic Labor Party split the Australian Labor Party early in 1955 and Australia went to the polls in December 1955. John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 - their third victory against Labor's H V Evatt. The Coalition was narrowly returned against Labor's Arthur Calwell in the December 1961 election, in the midst of a credit squeaze. Menzies stood for office for the last time in the November 1963 election, again defeating Calwell, with the Coalition winning back its losses in the House of Representatives. Menzies went on to resign from parliament on 26 January 1966.
Menzies' 1949 Cabinet had the leader of the Country Party, Arthur Fadden, as the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister and included Dame Enid Lyons as the first woman to serve in an Australian Cabinet.
Economy and trade.
After winning office in 1949, Menzies fulfilled his promises to end rationing of butter, tea and petrol and provide a 5 shilling endowment for first born children, as well as for others.
Australia experienced a prolonged economic boom during the Menzies years. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner. John McEwen, as minister for commerce and for trade negotiated the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957. The agreement carried political risk for the Menzies government, because memories of atrocities perpetrated on Australians by Japan in World War II were still strong in the community. Britain meanwhile was negotiating entry into the European Economic Community in the early 1960s with major implications for Australian trade, which had previously enjoyed preferential treatment in the U.K. McEwen was active in maintaining tariff protections for agriculture, mining and manufacturing, which he believed would sustain employment and contribute to national defence.
In the early 1950s, external affairs minister Percy Spender helped to establish the Colombo Plan for providing economic aid to underdeveloped nations in Australia's region. Under the scheme, many future Asian leaders studied in Australia.
Other than blocking the nationalisation of the Banking system by the Labor Party, Menzies privatised the Commonwealth Oil Refinery. The wool industry remained a mainstay of the economy through the 1950s, indeed it was said that the Australian economy "rode on the sheep's back". Nevertheless, important developments in further industries occurred, such as the construction of Australia's first commercial oil field at Moonie in Queensland in 1961.
In 1960, the government split the Commonwealth Bank of Australia into the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Reserve Bank of Australia.
While for most Australians the Menzies era was an era of propsperity, the nation experienced high inflation during the early years of Menzies' rule. The Korean War increased demand for commodities. Wool in particular boomed, leading to a rise in growers' incomes, but also to inflation. The Arbitration Court helped stabilize wages from 1953. From 1959-1960 Australia experienced something of a boom, spurred by overseas speculators and high domestic spending - resulting in recession by 1961, following a "horror" mini-budget designed to slow the economy. Unemployment reaching 2.1% (at that time considered "high") and Menzies went on to win the 1961 election by just one seat. Following the election, Menzies and Treasurer Harold Holt introduced another mini-budget designed to spur growth and the economy was in recovery.
Foreign Affairs.
The Menzies era saw immense regional changes, with post-war reconstruction and the withdrawal of European Powers and the British Empire from the Far East (including independence for India and Indonesia); the consolidation of Communist regimes in China, North Vietnam, North Korea and Communist insurgencies elsewhere.
Cold War.
Menzies was firmly anti-Communist. In 1950 his government committed troops to the Korean War and attempted to ban the Communist Party of Australia. Menzies secured passage of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill through Parliament in June 1950. Although it had popular support, for many it went too far in such measures as allowing the disqualifying of declared Communists from public offices, or industries considered vital to defence. The Bill had the support of anti-Communist Labor Senators, and so passed through Parliament. Early in 1951 however, the High Court declared the Act invalid for unconstitutionally interfering with civil liberties and property rights. Following the 1951 election, Menzies held a referendum seeking power for the Federal Parliament to legislate "With respect to Communists or Communism as the Parliament considers to be necessary or expedient for the defence or security of the Commonwealth". Labor leader H V Evatt campaigned against the proposal and the referendum was narrowly defeated.
In 1951, during the early stages of the Cold War, Menzies spoke of the possibility of a looming third world war. Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov and his wife defected from the Soviet embassy in Canberra in 1954, revealing evidence of Russian spying activities and Menzies called a Royal Commission. The Labor Party split over concerns about the influence of the Communist Party over the Trade Union movement, leading to the foundation of the breakaway Democratic Labor Party(DLP) whose preferences supported the Liberal and Country Party, in return for key concessions, like funding for Catholic schools. The new Party never won a House of Representatives seat, but often held the balance of power in the Senate.
Treaties and defence.
Australia signed the official Peace Treaty with Japan in San Francisco in 1951, but by this point, the world had entered a new and tense period in international relations - the Cold War. With the memory of Japanese expansionism fresh in the Australian experience, and with the commencement of the Cold War seeing the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe, the Chinese Communist Party winning the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and Communist North Korea invading South Korea in 1950, Australia sought security outside its traditional allegiance to Britain.
In June 1950, Communist North Korea invaded South Korea. The Menzies government responded to a United States led United Nations Security Council request for military aid for South Korea and diverted forces from occupied Japan to begin Australia's involvement in the Korean War. The entry of Communist China into the war saw allied forces driven backwards down the peninsula. After fighting to a bitter standstill, the UN and North Korea signed a ceasefire agreement in July 1953. Australian forces had participated in such major battles as Kapyong and Maryang San. 17,000 Australians had served and casualties amounted to more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed.
Analysts voiced fear of the "domino theory", according to which South East Asia would fall to Communism state by state. In defence policy, Menzies moved Australia to a policy of "forward defence" and committed troops against Communists insurgencies in South East Asia – the Malayan Emergency, and Indonesia's policy of Confrontation and, near the end of Menzies' prime ministership, the early stages of the Vietnam War.
In 1951, the first call ups were made under the National Service Act, which provided for compulsory military training of 18-year-old men, who were then to remain on the Army Reserve for five years. The Scheme trained 227,000 men between 1951 and 1960 (when it ended). In 1952, a program of British nuclear weapons testing began in Australia. The program was based at Maralinga, South Australia from 1954 until 1963 (and was later the subject of a Royal Commission investigation).National Service was reintroduced in 1964, in the form of the National Service Lottery, under which Marbles of birth dates were drawn from a lottery barrel. The Scheme remained in place until 1972 and saw 63,000 men conscripted.
The Menzies Government entered the first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States in San Francisco in 1951. External Affairs Minister Percy Spender had put forward the proposal to work along similar lines to the NATO Alliance. The Treaty declared that any attack on one of the three parties in the Pacific area would be viewed as a threat to each, and that the common danger would be met in accordance with each nation's constitutional processes.
In 1954, the Menzies Government signed the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO) as a South East Asian counterpart to NATO.
In 1959, Australia signed the Antarctic Treaty agreeing a legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
Suez Crisis.
Robert Menzies' was despatched to Cairo by an 18 nation committee to act as chairman in negotiations with Egyptian President Nasser following his 1956 nationalisation of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. Western powers had built the trade canal, but Egypt was now seeking to exclude them from a role in its ownership or management. Menzies felt that Nasser's actions threatened Australia's interests as a trading nation and an ally of Britain.
Menzies' 7 September official communique to Nasser presented a case for compensation for the Suez Canal Company and the "establishment of principles" for the future use of the Canal that would ensure that it would "continue to be an international waterway operated free of politics or national discrimination, and with financial structure so secure and an international confidence so high that an expanding and improving future for the Canal could be guaranteed" and called for a Convention to recognise Egyptian sovereignty of the Canal, but for the establishment of an international body to run the canal. Nasser saw such measures as a "derogation from Egyptian sovereignty" and rejected Menzies' proposals.
Menzies hinted to Nasser that Britain and France might use force to resolve the crisis, but United States President Eisenhower openly opposed the use of force and Menzies left Egypt without success. Menzies voiced support for the subsequent Anglo-French military operation in Egypt, which resulted in a humiliating withdrawal and the resignation of the British Prime Minister, Anthony Eden.
Commonwealth of Nations.
The Menzies era saw the sun set on the British Empire and the expansion of the Commonwealth of Nations as its successor. Menzies and Australians in general remained deeply loyal to the institution of the Monarchy in Australia and the 1954 Royal Tour by Queen Elizabeth II and her consort, Prince Phillip was greeted by wild enthusiasm across the continent. Harold Macmillan then became the first British Prime Minister to visit in 1958.
The first tour by a reigning monarch saw her cover 10,000 miles by air and 2,000 miles by ground. On a later Royal Tour in 1963, Menzies famously and effusively praised Queen Elizabeth by quoting an Elizabethan era poem: "I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die".
As decolonisation proceeded around the British Empire, the Menzies Government followed Britain's lead and imposed economic sanctions on Southern Rhodesia when the Ian Smith government had declared self-government to maintain white minority rule.
Society and welfare.
The Menzies Government instigated a series of important reforms to immigration laws, which resulted in the erosion of the restrictions of the unofficial White Australia Policy which had privileged British migrants over all others since the time of Australian Federation in 1901 and abolished restrictions on voting rights for Aborigines, which had persisted in some jurisdictions.
In 1960, the Menzies Government introduced a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which expanded the range of prescribed medicines subsidised by the government. In 1961, The Matrimonial Causes Act introduced a uniform divorce law across Australia and recognised "no-fault" divorce by allowing a specified period of separation as sufficient grounds for a divorce.
Immigration.
Beginning in 1949, Immigration Minister Harold Holt decided to allow 800 non-European war refugees to remain in Australia, and Japanese war brides to be admitted to Australia. In 1950 External Affairs Minister Percy Spender instigated the Colombo Plan, under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957 non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the "dictation test" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in "any" European language. Immigration Minister, Sir Alexander Downer, announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead up to the Holt Government's watershed "Migration Act, 1966".
Aboriginal affairs.
Campaigns for Aboriginal rights gathered pace in Australia during the Menzies era. When Menzies assumed office, Aborigines were still excluded from voting in Federal elections in Queensland and West Australia. In 1949, Parliament legislated to ensure that all Aboriginal ex-servicemen should have the right to vote. In 1961 a Parliamentary Committee was established to investigate and report to the Parliament on Aboriginal voting rights and in 1962, Menzies' "Commonwealth Electoral Act" provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections. In 1963, Yolngu people petitioned Parliament, with the famous Yirrkala bark petitions, after the government excised land from the Arnhem Land reserve, without consulting the traditional owners.
Echoing developments in the United States and elsewhere in the Western World and their disintegrating colonial empires, attitudes to race underwent significant shifts in Australia during the Menzies era. Aboriginal artists like Albert Namatjira could gain great popularity and be presented to the Queen on her first Royal Tour, but under existing law still needed to be "granted" Australian citizenship. Indigenous activists like Douglas Nicholls and Faith Bandler continued their long campaign of lobbying governments for legal reform and University of Sydney students led by Charles N. Perkins sought to expose inequalities with their freedom rides in the mid-60s. Menzies' successor Harold Holt instigated the famous 1967 Referendum, which saw a 90% endorsement from the electorate to automatically include Aboriginal people in the national census.
Education, science and infrastructure.
The Menzies Government extended Federal involvement in education and developed the city of Canberra as the national capital. Menzies introduced the Commonwealth scholarship scheme in 1951, to cover fees and pay a generous means-tested allowance for bright students from lower socioeconomic groups. In 1956, a committee headed by Sir Keith Murray was established to inquire into the financial plight of Australia's universities, and Menzies' pumped funds into the sector under conditions which preserved the autonomy of universities.
In 1954, the government established Mawson Station in Antarctica as Australia's first permanent base on the continent and in 1957, Davis Station was constructed.
In 1956, Television in Australia began broadcasting. In a significant step, Menzies opted for a hybrid system, licensing both commercial and public broadcasters.
The Australian Atomic Energy Commission (now Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) was set up under the Atomic Energy Act in 1953 and Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor commenced operation in 1958.
From 1960 the Government allowed the United States to establish satellite tracking stations in the A.C.T. - resulting in the construction of Orroral Creek, Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla. The National Astronomical Observatory, a 64-metre radio telescope at Parkes was opened in 1961. These facilities would prove crucial to the United States Lunar Program. Australia joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium in 1964.
In 1960, money was set aside for the construction of the long-delayed Lake Burley Griffin – the original centre-piece of the design for Canberra.
In 1962, an interstate coaxial cable linking the Eastern seaboard cities was completed. International direct dial was achieved with the opening of the Commonwealth Pacific Cable in 1963, in a scheme designed to link the Commonwealth by phone.
Menzies era.
In his last address to the Liberal Party Federal Council in 1964, Menzies reflected on the "Liberal Creed" as follows:
Though often characterised as a "conservative" period in Australian history, the Menzies era was a period of sustained economic boom with rapid technological advance and Australia experienced the beginnings of sweeping social change – with the arrivals of rock and roll music and television in the 1950s. Melbourne hosted the Olympics and iconic Australian performers like Barry Humphries, Johnny O'Keefe and Slim Dusty emerged in the arts scene during the 1950s. Though support for the monarchy in Australia remained strong, Australia's cultural and political identity began a slow shift away from its traditional British allegiance.
Retirement of Menzies.
Menzies was Knighted in 1963, and was honoured in 1965 by being appointed to succeed Winston Churchill as Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. Menzies' second period as prime minister lasted a record sixteen years and seven consecutive election victories and ended in his voluntary retirement on 26 January 1966, aged 71. Harold Holt replaced the retiring Menzies in 1966 and the Holt Government went on to win 82 seats to Labor's 41 in the 1966 Election.

Netsilik dialect

Netsilik , Natsilik,Nattilik, Netsilingmiut, Natsilingmiutut, Nattilingmiutut, Nattiliŋmiutut is a dialect of Inuvialuktun (Western Canadian Inuit or Inuktitut) language once spoken in the Nattilik area of Nunavut, Canada by Netsilik Inuit people.
Natsilingmiut (ᓇᑦᓯᓕᖕᒥᐅᑦ “people from Natsilik”) came from "natsik" “seal” + postbase "-lik" “place with something” + postbase "-miut" “inhabitants of”.
Special letters.
Natsilik dialect has the special letters: š ř ŋ
These special characters are used by some Nattiliŋmiut speakers to document their dialect.
š – sounds like ‘shr’ and is distinct from both the s sound that is used in words borrowed from English and the more common h sound.
ř (in Inuktitut syllabics ᖬ řa ᖨ ři ᖪ řu ᖭ řaa ᖩ řii ᖫ řuu) – sounds like an English (retroflex) r. It is distinct from the r sound used by other dialects, which is closer to the r sound made in French at the back of the throat.
ŋ – A small number of Inuktitut speakers use this character instead of ng. The use of ng is deceiving because it makes use of two letters to represent what is actually a single sound. In syllabics this sound is represented by a single character ᖕ.
Using this letter also makes the distinction between the sequence and long [ŋː clearer, the first being spelled ‘nŋ’ and the latter ‘ŋŋ’. In eastern varieties of Inuktitut which do not have the sequence long [ŋː is spelled ‘nng’ rather than ‘ngng’.
When the letter ‘ŋ’ is not used, the distinction may be made by spelling ‘n'ng’ and [ŋː ‘nng’.

We Who Are About To...

We Who Are About To... is a feminist science fiction novel by Joanna Russ. It first appeared in magazine form in the January 1976 and February 1976 issues of "Galaxy Science Fiction" and was first published in book form by Dell Publishing in July 1977.
Plot.
The story takes the form of an audio diary kept by the unnamed protagonist. A group of people, with no technical skills and scant supplies, are stranded on a planet and debate how to survive. The men in the group are dedicated to colonizing and populating the planet, but the unnamed female protagonist, who does not believe that long term survival is possible, resists being made pregnant by them. Tensions escalate into violence, until finally she is forced to kill the other survivors in order to defend herself against rape. Left alone, she becomes increasingly philosophical, recounting her personal history in political agitation and attempting to chart the days and seasons even as she begins to hallucinate from hunger and loneliness. She experiences visions, first of the people she killed, and then of people from her past. Finally, weak from hunger, she resolves to kill herself.
Reception.
"We Who Are About To..." received poor reviews at the time of publication, and was panned by Spider Robinson writing in "Analog", and by Algis Budrys in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction". Later reviews have been more positive, however; David Pringle referred to it as "a grim tale which inverts the usual sf myth of human indomitability" in "The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction", and Sarah Lefanu said in "In the Chinks of the World Machine: Feminism and Science Fiction" that "for all its brevity can withstand a multiplicity of readings. It is about how to die, then it is as much about how to live." Samuel R. Delany called "We Who Are About To..." "a damningly fine analysis of the mechanics of political and social decay", offering the interpretation that "Russ suggests that the quality of life is the purpose of living, and reproduction only a reparative process to extend that quality—and not the point of life at all... only feudal societies can really believe wholly that reproduction... is life's real point."

Marcus Morris (basketball)

Marcus "Mook" Morris (born September 2, 1989) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Phoenix Suns of the NBA. He played college basketball at Kansas.
Early years.
Morris was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Thomasine "Angel" Morris. He has four brothers, Donte, Blake, David and twin Markieff, who also plays in the NBA for the Phoenix Suns.
College career.
He enrolled at the University of Kansas where he majored in American studies. He was named the 2010–11 Big 12 Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He also was named a second team All-American for his play in the 
2010–11 basketball season by both the Associated Press and the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and a third team All-America by Fox Sports. On March 30, 2011, Morris was named to the ten member John R. Wooden Award Men’s All American team. Morris and his brother signed with a sports agent from Los Angeles, and announced that they would enter the 2011 NBA Draft.
Professional career.
Morris was selected by the Houston Rockets with the 14th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, 5 minutes directly after his brother Markieff Morris was taken with the 13th pick by the Phoenix Suns. He was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers team by the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association on January 2, 2012. In his first game in the D-League on January 6, 2012, Morris recorded 33 points and 16 rebounds in a narrow 105–103 loss to the Dakota Wizards. Morris returned to the Rockets on January 16, 2012, was reassigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers on February 3, 2012 and returned to the Rockets again on February 20, 2012.
After what was considered to be a disappointing first year, Marcus decided to train with his brother Markieff around the Phoenix area to help improve himself.
Due to an injury to Patrick Patterson, Rockets head coach Kevin McHale named Morris the opening day starter at power forward for the 2012–2013 season. When told he would be starting, Morris thought that McHale was kidding, since he rarely played his rookie season and was hurt during the preseason.
On February 21, 2013, Morris was traded to the Phoenix Suns, reuniting him with his brother. A day later, the Morris twins would officially play together in the last 6 minutes of a loss to the Boston Celtics, with Marcus getting 7 points, 2 steals, and a rebound during that period of time, despite having no formal training from the Suns before entering the game. This officially marked the second time that twin brothers would end up playing for the same NBA team; Dick and Tom Van Arsdale played together during the 1976–77 season. On March 1, 2013, Morris scored 16 points for the Suns to help the Suns beat the Atlanta Hawks 92-87. He made four out of five three-point field goal attempts. Marcus would end up starting with Markieff on March 10, 2013 against Marcus' former team, the Houston Rockets, which made the Morris twins the first set of twin brothers to ever start for the same NBA team.
Personal.
Morris's twin brother Markieff Morris was selected 13th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 2011 NBA Draft. Marcus is seven minutes younger than Markieff. He is a fan of his hometown Philadelphia Eagles while his twin brother is a fan of the rival Dallas Cowboys.

Angela Williams (politician)

Angela Williams is a legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. Elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2010, Williams represents House District 7, which encompasses the northeast part of Denver, including the neighborhoods of Montbello and Green Valley Ranch, and the Denver International Airport.
Legislative career.
2012 election.
In the 2012 General Election, Representative Williams faced Republican challenger Travis French. Williams was reelected by a wide margin of 83% to 17%.
2013 legislative session.
During the 2013 Colorado legislative session Representative Beth McCann sponsored HB13-1249, The Colorado Mortgage Accountability And Housing Stabilization Act. The bill would have restored minimal protections for homeowners in a 120 hearing. The House committee on Business, Labor, Economic and Workforce Development chaired by Representative Angela Williams killed the bill 9-2 in committee. Corrine Fowler, Economic Justice Director of the Colorado Progressive Coalition observed a “blatant disregard for the democratic process” speaking of the way Representative Williams conducted the hearing. According to Ms. Fowler, “the bill, as amended, would simply have provided the homeowners with a degree of due process that does not currently exist”. Although twenty-nine individual supporters of the bill showed up to tell their stories of predatory lending and lack of due process in the foreclosure process they were only given two minutes to speak while proponents, all connected to the financial industry, were given five minutes each to make their statement.
Williams spoke during a town hall she conducted on March 11, 2013, and spoke in support of HB13-1249. Supporters of the bill recorded the town hall and produced a video aimed at showing how she originally spoke about the need for the legislation. Shortly thereafter, Williams began expressing concerns with the bill by email, and refused to meet with supporters of the legislation, whom she called bullies. She used this term after Colorado Progressive Coalition (CPC) called on supporters to sit in at her office in the Denver Capitol to try and get an audience with her. She had been refusing to meet with CPC prior to that, even though they were supporting Representative McCann in sponsoring the bill.
Furthermore shortly after the bill was killed in committee two Federal District Court judges began questioning the constitutionality of the 120 hearings, U.S. District Judges Philip Brimmer and William Martinez. Judge Martinez stated, “At issue is a provision in state law that allows lawyers to assert that their client, typically a bank, has the right to foreclose on a property even though they might not have the original mortgage paperwork to prove it. Colorado is the only state in the country that allows an unsworn statement by an attorney for a foreclosing party – without any penalty – to say, ‘Trust me, judge, these guys are the qualified holder for this deed of trust,’ “Is there another state that has lowered the bar for a foreclosure any lower?”
Failed Stalking Charge.
In October 2013, Williams pursued a stalking charge against Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition activist Darren O'Connor. Mr. O'Connor did not deny, in court, that he had focused solely on Representative Williams after she chaired the committee that killed HB13-1249: The Colorado Mortgage and Housing Stabilization Act. Williams lost in court and Mr. O'Connor's efforts were characterized as effective political speech 
Magistrate Cary's order stated that Defendant (Darren O'Connor)is an effective and articulate spokesperson for his political beliefs, which do not always align with those of Representative Williams. But he has a right to express those beliefs in a peaceful, if persistent, way.
In denying Representative Williams Petition and citing City of Boulder v. Seth Brigham the Honorable Catherine Cary found that there were other more appropriate remedies available to the Petitioner, which would not threaten anyone's right to an exercise of free speech. And this Court agrees. Accordingly, Petitioner's request for a Permanent Civil Protection Order is denied.

Industries Mécaniques Maghrébines

The Industries Mécaniques Maghrébines S.A. (IMM) are a Tunisian car manufacturer headquartered in the city of Kairouan. The company was founded in 1982 and closed for the first time in 1988; the plant was reopened in 1991. Since then, the manufacturer has formed subsidiaries to distribute its vehicles in Carthage, Tunis and Oued Smar, Algeria.
The company is a joint-venture between the General Motors Company (20 per cent), Isuzu Motors Ltd. (10 per cent) and the locomotive builder General Motors du Tunisie S.A. (70 per cent). The latter provides the staff for the company.
In January 2008, it was announced that the Algerian subsidiary will be converted for the assembly of vehicles. The new IMM plant will assemble up to 25,000 units a year. In Kairouan, the IMM is manufacturing up to 4,000 units a year. The vehicles will be marketed alongside the two local markets in Gibraltar, Morocco, Mauritania and Libya. The IMM is responsible for the supply of the markets of the Maghreb region and the Arab Maghreb Union.
Special attention was given to the vehicles of the IMM in the 2011 Libyan civil war when Gaddafi's henchmen used them to attack their own cities to spread fear and terror.
Currently the IMM is the only Tunisian car manufacturer besides Wallyscar. However, in Algeria SOVAC (VW), Elsecom Motors (Ford) and the RPA (Renault) are serious competitors.

McCormick Field Raceway

McCormick Field Raceway was constructed around 1957 and is a quarter-mile oval track built around the famous baseball diamond after Asheville, North Carolina had lost its minor league team. The track hosted weekly stock car races and a pair of NASCAR Convertible Series (Now Nationwide Series) and one Grand National (Now Sprint Cup) race.
History.
Grand National.
NASCAR's top series only raced once at McCormick Field. A likely reason for the abbreviated run was a large obstacle the drivers had to avoid. Built around the tight confines of a baseball field, drivers had to pay particularly close attention. If they ran wide or got loose, they didn't run the risk of banging the wall or sliding through the infield, they might find themselves wedged down into the first-base dugout. It happened to Lee Petty during his championship winning season of 1958. Petty was running near the front during a heat race at the track when a bump from Cotton Owens sent him running into the dugout. The team repaired Petty's car in time for the main event and he finished one lap down in fourth place. Jim Paschal won driving a car owned by Julien Petty, Lee's brother.
Convertible Division.
Curtis Turner won the 1956 and 1957 NASCAR Convertible Division races which were the only two races held at the track.

Czechoslovakia at the Paralympics

Czechoslovakia made its Paralympic Games début at the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, where it was one of just four Eastern Bloc nations competing (the other three being Hungary, Poland and Romania). Czechoslovakia sent a delegation of nineteen athletes, who all competed in track and field, and won a single bronze medal in the shot put.
The country's participation in the Summer Paralympics was sporadic. It missed the 1976 Games, sent a delegation of seven athletes to the 1980 Summer Paralympics in Arnhem, missed the 1984 Games, then competed in 1988 and 1992, before its dissolution in 1993. At the Winter Paralympics, however, Czechoslovakia took part in the inaugural Games in Örnsköldsvik in 1976 (with a delegation of five athletes), and participated in every edition of the Games until its dissolution. Since 1994, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have competed separately.
During their nine participations in the Paralympics, Czechoslovakians won a total of 27 medals - seven gold, ten silver and ten bronze. Thus the country ranks fifty-fourth on the all-time Paralympic Games medal table (behind both of its successor states).
Only four Czechoslovakians have won gold medals at the Paralympic Games. Eva Lemezova is the country's most successful Paralympian, having won three gold medals in women's alpine skiing in 1976, as well as a silver in 1980. Pavla Valnickova won two gold medals in track events in 1992, as well as a bronze, and a bronze and a silver in cross-country skiing that same year. Miloslava Behalova won a gold in the discus in 1992, and Vojtech Vasicek is Czechoslovakia's only male Paralympic champion, having won the pentathlon in 1992.

Disability Pride Parades

Disability Pride Parades are parades held to celebrate people with disabilities.
Disability Pride Parades have been held in several places across the United States, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta, Silicon Valley/Santa Clara County, Detroit, Colorado Springs, New Jersey, and Columbus as well as around the world in locations such as Norway, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.
The first Disability Pride Day was held in Boston, MA in 1990. The featured speaker was Karen Thompson, author of "Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home?" The Boston Disability Pride Parade was held again in 1991, but has not been held since. It ended with the death of lead organizer, Diana Viets, and with the move of co-organizer Catherine Odette to Madison, WI.
Goals.
Disability Pride Parades seek to change the way people think about and define "disability", to end the stigma of disability, and to promote the belief that disability is a natural and beautiful part of human diversity in which people living with disabilities can take pride.
Disability Pride Parades also usually coincide with Disability Pride Week in the communities where they are held.
Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
The Chicago Disability Pride Parade was the first parade in the United States after the Boston-based parades of the 1990s. It was held on July 18, 2004, and another Disability Pride Parade has been held in Chicago each subsequent July. The first Chicago parade was funded with $10,000 in seed money that Sarah Triano received in 2003 as part of the Paul G. Hearne Leadership award from the American Association of People with Disabilities. According to Triano, fifteen hundred people attended the parade. The most recent Disability Pride Parade in Chicago was held July 21, 2012, with the theme "Disability Pride: Today, Tomorrow, and Forever".
The Chicago Disability Pride Parade has a theme and a grand marshal each year.

Technology doping

Technology doping is a new term that has been becoming more popular recently in sports. Technology doping is the practice of gaining a competitive advantage using sports equipment. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) considers prohibiting technologies if they are "performance-enhancing" or "being against the spirit of the sport". In 2006, WADA initiated a consultation on technology doping which is now officially recognised as a threat, whilst the decision to allow or ban a new technology, specifically relating to sports equipment, is the responsibility of each sport’s own governing body.
Grey area.
Since most sports require equipment of some sort, it can be tricky to determine what is technology doping and what is not. The governing authorities of different sports usually make judgment calls about the technological advances in their sport’s equipment. Technological advancements are often allowed unless the governing authorities feel they threaten the integrity of the sport. 
A report released immediately before the 2012 Summer Olympics quotes an extensive public survey that shows that people fear that sports engineering could: overshadow the triumph of human spirit and effort, make certain sports easier, create unfairness so the "best athletes" might not win, and ensure that rich athletes and countries have an advantage over the poor ones.
LZR racer swimsuit.
The LZR Racer has been one of the most discussed technologies accused of being technology doping. The LZR Racer bodysuit by Speedo is a high-performance swimsuit. It is made with a material that was designed to mimic shark skin. The suit allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles, holds the body in a more hydrodynamic position, and traps air which adds buoyancy. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, this suit was worn by many swimmers. In fact, some swimmers wore two or more of these suits at once to increase buoyancy. In total, 23 out of the 25 swimming world records broken at the Beijing Olympics were broken by swimmers wearing this suit. Some people thought these suits might be so technologically advanced that using them in competition was essentially technology doping. FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation), is the international governing body of swimming. After the Beijing Olympics and subsequent swimming events, at which many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit, FINA banned all body-length swimsuits. Men's suits could only maximally cover from the waist to the knee. Women's suits could only cover from shoulder to knee. They also stipulated that the fabric used to make the suits must be a “textile” and the suit could not have fastening devices, such as zippers. These new rules took effect in January 2010.
Other examples.
In addition to the LZR suit, there are several other technologies that have been or could soon be deemed too technologically advanced.

Beagle B.218

The Beagle B.218X (also known as the Beagle-Miles M.218) was a 1960s British four-seat twin-engined light transport monoplane built by Beagle Aircraft Limited at Shoreham Airport. The prototype was modified into the Beagle B.242X but neither variant entered production.
Design and development.
Before it became part of Beagle Miles Aircraft had looked at producing replacements for the (single-engined) Miles Messenger and (twin-engined) Gemini. Three low-wing monoplane designs were considered, the single-engined fixed landing gear Miles 114 in two and four-seat versions and the retractable landing gear twin-engined four-seat Miles 115. When Beagle was formed it was decided to build a prototype of the Miles 115 design designated the Beagle-Miles M.218; it was also decided to build a prototype of the Miles 114 as the M.117 but in the end it was not built.
The M.218 was of plastic construction and was a powered by two Rolls Royce Continental O-300 piston engines and had a retractable tricycle landing gear. Construction started at the end of 1961 and it made its first flight at Shoreham on 19 August 1962. Registered "G-ASCK" it was displayed at the 1962 Farnborough Air Show priced at £9,800, it did create interest from customers although they had a preference for metal built aircraft rather than the plastic M.218. 
The production aircraft were to be named "Martlet" but the company did not have the money to put it into production and it was withdrawn in 1963 for modification. A new metal fuselage was built and more powerful IO-360 engines were fitted. Now re-registered "G-ASTX" it reflew again on the 27 August 1964, now designated as the Beagle B.242. The aircraft was issued with a certificate of airworthiness on 18 June 1965 but the company was busy with the production of the twin-engined Beagle B.206 and single-engined Beagle Pup and could not afford to further develop the type or put it into production. The aircraft was withdrawn from use in 1966 and subsequently destroyed in a fire in August 1969.

Simon Gales is a contemporary representational artist and painter of limited output who destroys much of his work. He exhibits mainly in London and lives in France.
Biography.
Simon Gales was born in Suffolk in 1964 and graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1988 achieving the joint highest 1st degree in a year that included most of the prominent YBAs including Gary Hume, Michael Landy and Ian Davenport. Six works from his degree show were selected along with 25 others across the nation to be auctioned at the Royal College of Art by Christies the following year. The first auction of new contemporaries by a major auction house attracted media attention and Gales's works were featured in the Telegraph Weekend Colour Supplement as well as the BBC 1 o'clock news; the auction surpassed expectations making an astonishing £1/4 million, Gales's selling for over 4 times the estimate. This led Gales to be commissioned by London Transport for whom he painted «Childhood» a painting London Underground used to publicise the V&A Museum of Childhood at Bethnal Green by making 6000 full sized posters of the image for underground stations with a further 3000 smaller ones for the escalators.
Despite being one of the few representational graduates from Goldsmiths, he was included in a number of largely conceptual exhibitions such as « A Spiritual Dimension » in 1989, a major touring exhibition organised by Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery along with Goldsmiths tutors Brian Falconbridge, Michael Kenny and Carl Plackman and including Craigie Aitcheson, Tess Jaray and Bob Law and supported by works from the Arts Council Collection as well as that of the Royal Academy. Due to the small scale of Gales’s works at this time, he was invited again from 1991-2 to join Craigie Aitcheson in another touring exhibition this time curated by Gillian Jason called « Cabinet Paintings » which also included Frank Auerbach, Howard Hodgekin, Euan Uglow and Sarah Raphael.
Gales had a series of solo exhibitions at The Bruton Street Gallery in Mayfair in 1999, 2001 which sold out and again in 2003 at which point the gallery closed down. He showed at The Albemarle Gallery in 2008 before moving to Jonathan Cooper in 2009 with whom he has remained.
Gales has often referred to himself as an image maker, his priority being the power of the single image presented as a frozen moment or simple statement. Latterly he has produced a series of works called Focus/Unfocus in which the varying focus within the images is aimed to alter their perception. The series was exhibited in London at Jonathan Cooper, Park Walk Gallery in February 2011.

<doc id="31240443" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31240443" title="Salamuri">
Salamuri

Salamuri () recorder instrument type. Sometimes two are played in harmony by one in each hand by one player.
Salamuri is widespread wind musical instrument in all regions of Georgia (especially in Kartli, Kakheti, Meskheti, Tusheti, Pshavi, and Imereti). Relics obtained from archeological excavations prove the existence of Salamuri in Georgia from the ancient times. Among the relics found by an archeological expedition in Mtskheta (Eastern part of Georgia), one thing very interesting for Georgian musical culture attracts out attention. This is a bone pipe, found in 1938 at the northern section of Samtavro’s sepulchre. This salamuri is made of swan (shin) bone. It is unreeded and has only three small keys on the front side. The surface of the instrument is well polished. Its length is 19,9 cm. The size of blowing part is 1,1 cm and the bottom’s part is 1,8 cm. It has been put with 14-15 year old dead boy into the grave. Many other things were also put there: earthenware, crockery, arms, clothes, a talisman and so on. It is worthy of note that there were sheep bones, bull’s head and feet bones there as well. On account of this the guide of the expedition the academician Iv. Djavakhishvili called it “The grave of a little shepherd”. The examination of sepulchre showed that it is dated back to 12th-11th century B.C. and if we take into consideration the instrument’s well developed design, it should have been widely spread in Georgia a long time before the mentioned date. Bone-pipes (Salamuris) were also found in “Uphliscikhe” (monastery) among the things contributed to the God of Beauty.
In 1930 a bone salamuri (flute) was found together with other things in ancient burials of Samtavro in Mtskheta. Supposedly it dates back to the 15th-13th centuries B.C.
At present this Salamuri is kept in "Simon Janashia State Museum". Researchers once have tried to make sound from it and have issued only four sounds. What they considered to be sufficient for their archeological researches also have counted sufficient. It was understandable as no one expected anything greater. It is necessary to note, that the researchers did not pay adequate attention to these four sounds. This instrument has an absolutely perfected and correct tetra chord that outstrips by thousands of years Greek tetra chord formation. But this Salamuri keeps much more secrets in itself! It appeared, that it is possible to issue 10 sounds from it not by the over-blowing, but by inclining the instrument under different angles, and in this way we get seven different tetra chords that, as the final result, it represents sound system.
In Georgia, there are two kinds of Salamuri preserved till the present day: reeded and unreeded Salamuri. These two kinds of Salamuri differ in their timber, form, sound range and resonance. The unreeded Salamuri represents a pipe of approx. 380-400mm in length. It has 8 front keys and sometimes one key on the back side. The first front key is placed 13 cm. apart from the head, but the other 6 front keys are separated by equal distance (3 cm). It is often made from cane, apricot-tree, reed and elder. It becomes slightly narrower towards the end, to blow in comfortably. The unreeded Salamuri has a diatonic scale of one octave. By overblowing, its compass increases. The unreeded Salamuri is mainly used in parts of east Georgia (Kakheti, Kartli, Meskheti, Tusheti and Pshavi). But the reeded Salamuri represents a wooden pipe of 23–36 cm. in length with a cut-off head. As usual, it has 8 front keys and one back key (between front first and second keys). The reed of Salamuri is a small tap (1,2-1,5 cm) inside the pipe. Reeded Salamuri is more often made out of walnut and apricot trees. Despite the fact that the reeded Salamuri is smaller than the unreeded one, its technical abilities are considerably higher (richer sounding and larger sound range). It is more difficult to design the reeded Salamuri and requires master’s experienced hand. The salamuri has a diatonic scale of one octave. By overblowing, its compass increases. The wood material for Salamuri should be proportionally grown up, straight, carefully cut down and drilled from the beginning to the end. The hollow and surface should be well polished. Then they would cut the pipe’s head and attach the instrument’s reed to this place. On the surface, the area of reed is a bit cut off. Only from this air way the air should be emitted, that is why the blowing part (neck) is entirely closed. Then they cut 8 oval front keys along the instrument’s reed. They should be separated from each other by equal distance (2 cm). The 9th key is cut out on the opposite side of the pipe (between first and the second keys). Thus, Salamuri is divided into three parts: the head or neck part, body or the key part and the ending. Each of them has its own size and a certain interrelation. The closer the first key is to the reed of the instrument the more high-pitched sound is produced. Men usually play Salamuri. Reeded Salamuri is widely spread all over Georgia. Salamuri started its existence in pastoral atmosphere. Consequently, Salamuri’s repertoire mainly consists of shepherd melodies. It was often accompanied combined with “Doli” (drum). The reeded Salamuri seems to be originated a bit later than the unreeded one and it was the widest spread folk instrument all over Georgia. That is made evident not only by the legends but also by the monuments of classical literature. According to the people’s belief, the sorrows of human being were the reason of creating Salamuri. The legend says that when the first reed grew up on the orphan’s grave, the wind blew and the reed moaned in a sad voice. Salamuri was an inseparatable close friend of a farmer that cheered him up in times of sorrow and sweetened his merriments. According to people’s belief, nothing can destroy a reed pipe; even fire cannot damage it. The parents’ faces are seen through its ashes and even the broken parts emit sweet tunes. According to some of the legends, people were presented with this instrument by God. That is why it is considered to be a divine musical instrument.
Georgian people, when creating each musical instrument tried resemble the nature’s sounds with them. For instance, Salamuri’s tunes sounds like birds’ song. According to the legends, Salamuri’s tunes cheered people up, tamed animals, makes birds sing, its sad tunes relieved human sorrows. According to one tale, Salamuri’s sad tunes could even make the grass cry.
Professional Salamuri players say that there is a difference between techniques of performance on these instruments: the reeded Salamuri is more difficult to play than the unreeded one. However, one can play any melody he/she wants on reeded Salamuri. The technical abilities of unreeded Salamuri are limited.
When designing Salamuri, masters take into account with which instrument it is going to be played. According to this, they define the octave range of the instrument. The masters can design two kinds of Salamuri: I-part and II-part (deep-voiced Salamuri is also produced).
Today this instrument has a stable place in Georgian folk ensembles. It has been traveling all over the world together with the spirited Georgian dances and has been spreading the sweet tunes of Iberian Salamuri.
When covering Salamuri by our fingers while slightly blowing we get C of the first octave. We pronounce the sound “T”. When lifting one low finger completely we get the sound D and if we lift the finger partly from C we get C. If we lift a finger from D completely we get E and lifting finger partly from E we get E. Then comes F when completely lifting the finger from E and when lifting a finger partly from F we get F. The G comes, partly lifting G, then A, B, completely lifting, H- lifting partly. When covering by all the fingers and blowing strongly we get C of the second octave. The sounds of the second octave we can get by lifting the fingers and blowing stronger.

Take Me Away (Tiff Lacey song)

"Take Me Away" is a song from popular British trance and house singer Tiff Lacey. It's the first single from her first full-length solo album titled "¡Viva!".
Release.
"Take Me Away" was released on March 9, 2011 on iTunes, including Original, Stereojackers, Tom Noize, Loverush UK!, Sequence 11 and Darren Flinders mixes. An unreleased Michael Badal remix leaked onto the internet.
Song information.
"Take Me Away" was originally written by Tiff Lacey back in 2006 for a collaboration with Tom Kent, who produced the music for the track. Because of unknown reasons the song was not signed to a label until 2010 when the singer signed to Loverush Digital and the label decided to take the song and to eventually release it as a single. During the recording process of Tiff Lacey's solo album, it was considered that "Take Me Away" would be a good choice both to be included on the album and to be released as its lead single, because of the funky, catchy sound, combined with fresh lyrics and Lacey's good vocal performance. The track went under heavy remixing from several DJs, who added even more commercial vibe, turning it into a club banger.
Music video.
Tiff Lacey created several videos for the different mixes of the song herself.

People of Ya-Sin

People of Ya-Sin is the phrase used by Muslims to refer to an ancient community who are mentioned in the Quran as the People of the City or the Companions of the City. The location and people of this city has been the subject of much scholarly debate in Islam.
In the Quran.
According to the Quran, God sent two prophets to this particular community. When the people of the city refused to hear their words, God sent a third prophet to strengthen them. The prophets told the people: "Truly we have been sent on a mission to you". The community mocked the message of the prophets and said "Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.". The prophets, in reply, rebuked the community, saying: "Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you: "And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message."
The Quran goes onto say that the prophets were threatened with stoning and torture, but they refused to give in and continued to warn the people to end their sinful ways. Then, from the farthest part of the city, there came running a man who exhorted the people to believe the message and told them: "O my people! Obey the messengers: "Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who have themselves received Guidance. The following verses, which describe the man's entrance in to "the garden", assumed to mean Heaven, has been interpreted by some scholars to mean that the believing man was martyred for his faith.
Accounts in exegesis.
Classical commentators on the Quran popularly identified the "People of the City" with the city of Antioch. Those scholars who identified the city with Antioch, however, were divided over the date of the event. One group believed that this event took place after Jesus and explained that the Quran's use of the word "messenger" in this context refers not to three prophets but to three of Jesus's disciples who were sent to Antioch to proclaim the message. Those of this view further explained that the name of the martyr was Habib the Carpenter, who is also known as The Believer of YaSin. The disciples believed to have been sent were Peter, John and others. Other commentators who while still believed that the city refers to Antioch explained that this is the narrative of a far older incident and that the three "messengers" mentioned were indeed prophets, namely Saduq, Masduq and Shalum.
But another school of classical scholars, among them Ibn Kathir, rejected the identification with Antioch altogether. These commentators explained that the described town could not have been Antioch as the city was never destroyed, with no historical records recording such an incident. The other main reason that these scholars gave for rejecting this particular identification is that the term "messengers" almost always refers to prophets in the Quran and never does it refer to the disciples of a prophet. Most modern scholars, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, rejected the identification with Antioch and stated that this identification was made with no real proof. Many scholars who rejected the identification did, however, link the narrative of the story with the preaching of Paul and Barnabas as described in Acts of the Apostles.

Gabrielle Bellocq

Gabrielle Bellocq was an artist in pastels. Born in Saint-Hilaire-de-Talmont on 15 June 1920. Died in Saint-Malo on 29 July 1999.
Summary.
Gabrielle Bellocq has been acknowledged as a great artist by the most respected and authoritative of Europe's Artistic Institutions: Salon des Artistes Francais (the highest awards of gold, silver and bronze medals received), Salon d'Automne in Paris and the Royal Academy of Arts in London. A purchase by the French State for the National Collection in 1980 places Gabrielle Bellocq amongst France's greatest artists of the 20th century. Her numerous personal exhibitions in Europe, America and Japan have always attracted enthusiastic collectors.
Gabrielle Bellocq was born in 1920 and has lived most of her life in the West of France, near the sea. Painting was her passion since childhood. Her many years of work and experimentation in pastel have resulted in a technique which is unique and still mystifies her fellow pastellists - virtually a new medium. Through this technique she could render impressionistic effects which even Van Gogh, Monet and Degas were unable to achieve with pastels.
The wide success of Gabrielle Bellocq's work can largely be attributed to her undoubted talent as a colourist: the incredible variety of colours, sometimes daringly bright, often incredibly subtle, full of fine nuances and with a pointillist touch produces an unusual perspective effect. Her landscapes and seascapes clearly remind us of the style of the great impressionists, and yet because she never painted from life but from her inspired inner vision, her paintings have a magical dreamlike quality.
Through her delightful figures from ancient times, she invites the viewer to join in her communion with nature. We go with them towards the light as through their eyes we are taken to places of marvelous beauty, tranquility and inner peace.
Her Life.
Her mother, an artistic lady, taught her piano and singing and organised one-to-one painting lessons with nuns at the couvent de Saint-Sornin, who were not artists to the highest degree. She was taught to copy others' work. The only painting and drawing classes that she was given was by these nuns. 
As a boarder at school from a very young age, she spent her Sundays between Sunday Mass, Vespers and walks in the Vendee countryside. Throughout this period she built up a library of images that she later reproduced in the form on neo-impressionist pastel paintings.
Around 1950, she came to live on the banks of the River Rance in a classic Malouinière (manor house) blessed with a pretty pond. We often find reproduced in her paintings this mansion house and pond, in a more or less idealised form.
She started painting again at the start of the 1960s. Little by little, she abandoned watercolours and guache to concentrate solely on using pastels, which she would dedicate herself to using during more than 30 years, for the entirety of every day. The only time she stopped was when her children and grand-children came to stay. 
She has exhibited profusely around the world, including in Paris, Windsor, Henley-on-Thames and Salisbury, Osaka (Japan), Chicago (Illinois), Sedona (Arizona) and Ede (Netherlands).
She died in the summer of 1999 and rests in the cemetery in Saint-Briac.
Her Major Prizes.
In 1978, the purchase by the French Ministry of Culture of her painting "Ouverture sur l’océan" (Opening onto the Ocean) for the National Collection confirmed the stature of this artist, and the prizes flowed. Some of the major ones are as follows:

Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa

The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa made various changes involving the financial management of national and provincial government. Most of its provisions came into force on 26 April 2002, and the remainder on 1 December 2003.
Provisions.
The amendment made the following changes to the Constitution:
Legislative history.
The amendment was passed by the National Assembly on 1 November 2001 with the requisite two-thirds majority (274 votes in favour), and by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on 15 November with eight of nine provinces in favour, KwaZulu-Natal being the lone dissenter. It was introduced to Parliament simultaneously with the Sixth Amendment, but was passed separately because it contained matters affecting provincial government which had to be approved by the NCOP.
The act was signed by President Thabo Mbeki on 7 December, but it contained a clause specifying that it would only come into force on a date set by presidential proclamation. A proclamation on 26 April 2006 brought most of the act into force on that same day, except for those related to the Financial and Fiscal Commission, which only came into force on 1 December 2003.
Formal title.
The official short title of the amendment is "Constitution Seventh Amendment Act of 2001". It was originally titled "Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2001" and numbered as Act No. 61 of 2001, but the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005 renamed it and abolished the practice of giving Act numbers to constitutional amendments.

C&amp;P Haulage Co Ltd v Middleton

C&P Haulage Co Ltd v Middleton [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1983/5.html EWCA Civ 5 is an English contract law case, concerning damages for costs incurred by a claimant related to a defendant's breach of contract.
Facts.
George Middleton had a licence to occupy premises for six months a time, renewable. He used it for his car repairs business. He improved the property, even though the contract stated fixtures were not to be removed at the end of the licence. C&P Haulage Co Ltd ejected him in breach of contract. Mr Middleton argued he should be entitled to damages for the cost of the improvements he made.
Judgment.
Ackner LJ held that Middleton’s loss did not flow from the breach of contract, but him going and doing the repairs when he was not meant to. So no recovery of reliance loss was available, where it would allow Middleton to escape a bad bargain or reverse the contractual allocation of risk.

Robert Byrne (author)

Robert Byrne (; born 1930) is an American author and Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame instructor of pool and carom billiards.
Early life and education.
Robert Leo Byrne, son of Tom and Clara Byrne, was born on May 22, 1930, and raised in Dubuque, Iowa. He attended St. Columbkille's elementary, Loras Academy, and Loras College.
He left Dubuque to attend Iowa State University, where his first sign of talent as a writer emerged as he edited a humor column in the school's newspaper. He transferred to University of Colorado, where he edited "Flatiron", the school's humor publication, and he graduated in 1954 with a degree in civil engineering.
Byrne began his career in 1954 as a Junior Civil Engineer for the City and County of San Francisco, Department of Engineering, Bureau of Public Works, Division of Highways.
Writing career.
In 1955, a year later, he found a way to combine his engineering and writing talents by joining "Western Construction" magazine as a reporter for the heavy construction industry. In 1961, he was named editor of the magazine, a position he held for over ten years.
Byrne became a full-time writer in 1977 after the publication of his third book. He is the author of seven novels, five collections of humorous quotations, seven books on billiards, two anthologies, and an expose of frauds in the literary world. One of his novels, "Thrill", was made into NBC’s Monday Night Movie, which aired for the first time on May 20, 1996. Four of his novels were selections of Reader's Digest Condensed Books and published in over a dozen languages.
Byrne's unusual mix of talents as a writer, engineer and billiard player formed the right skill set to create what would become one of the definitive instructional works on cue sports. "Byrne’s Standard Book of Pool and Billiards", published in 1978 and expanded in 1998, has sold over 500,000 copies. It is one of the very few such works that includes diagrams that are mathematically and physically accurate, plotting the path of the center of the balls, which never quite reach the cushions of the table. Byrne coined the pool jargon term "" in this book, defining the deflection effect that sends the toward the right when struck with left , and vice versa.
Byrne's books, hundreds of instructional magazine articles, seven instructional videos (shot on sound stages in Burbank and Hollywood, California), have established him as the preeminent teacher and commentator in the world of pool and billiards. He has been a columnist and Contributing Editor for "Billiard Digest" magazine since its first issue in 1978, and a columnist for Dubuque's "Telegraph Herald" since 2000. His most recent publication is "Behold My Shorts", a collection of a decade of his monthly newspaper columns.
In 1994 on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, he received the Industry Service Award from the Billiard and Bowling Institute of America, an honor previously bestowed on Willie Mosconi, Paul Newman, and Jackie Gleason. In 1998, the readers of "Billiards Digest" named Byrne "Best Billiards Writer". His contributions to billiards and pool were recognized with induction into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame. The honor, perhaps the greatest in the field, was bestowed for Meritorious Service, on July 21, 2001, at the Las Vegas Hilton at a banquet closing the annual International Billiard & Home Recreation Expo. He was inducted with many-time World Three-cushion Billiards Champion Raymond Ceulemans of Belgium.
As of May, 2011, he is nearly finished with a new collection of humorous quotations.
Playing career.
Byrne's first success as a pool hustler came at the age of 12 when he beat the gas meter reader out of 85 cents on the family home's basement pool table in a game of 8-ball.
As a player, he has ranked in U.S. national-class tournaments in multiple disciplines:
Byrne performed the pool trick shots for "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" in 1993.
He has had a three-cushion billiards of 14, at age 29 and again at 79. The last time he ran his age in straight pool was Age 78.
Personal life.
On May 12, 1958, Byrne married Josefa Heifetz, concert pianist and daughter of legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz. On May 16, 1962, Josefa gave birth to Russell Heifetz Byrne, their only child, who now works as a network consulting engineer for Cisco Systems. Byrne and Heifetz were divorced in 1976. On May 9, 1991, Byrne married Cynthia Nelms, a graphic artist and painter, who struck his fancy by sending him an extremely well-written fan letter.
After living in California for nearly 40 years, Byrne moved back to his childhood home of Dubuque, Iowa with Cindy in 1996, which was not without complications due to the controversial nature of his semi-autobiographical novel "Memories of a Non-Jewish Childhood." Byrne's civic involvement in Dubuque includes serving as president of the Friends of Wahlert Library, Loras College, and as a boardmember of both the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra and Dubuque Museum of Art.
Byrne is also an amateur stage magician, is a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and has published tricks in "Genie" magazine. He was once a Class A tournament chess player, with a United States Chess Federation rating over 1800.

Hell's Pavement

"Hell's Pavement" is a science fiction novel by Damon Knight. The story postulates a technique for dealing with asocial behavior by giving everyone an "analogue", a mental imprint of an authority figure that intervenes whenever violent or otherwise harmful acts are contemplated.
Chapter I first appeared in "Astounding Science Fiction" in January 1952 as "The Analogues". Parts of Chapters II, III, IV and VIII were adapted from Knight's story "Turncoat", which appeared in the April 1953 "Thrilling Wonder Stories". The novel was renamed "Analogue Men" starting with the 1962 Berkley Books version, but regained its original title with a 1971 paperback edition.
Synopsis.
Early in the novel, one of the characters gives a description of the analogue treatment:
"He's got an analogue," said Martyn. "In the classical sense, he is even less sane than he was before. He has auditory, visual and tactile hallucinations -- a complete, integrated set. That's enough to get you entry to most institutions, crowded as they are. But, you see, these hallucinations are pro-societal. They were put there deliberately. He's an acceptable member of society, because he has them...Nobody knows the analogue looks like except himself. A policeman, maybe, or his mother as she looked when he was a child. Someone whom he fears, and whose authority he acknowledges. The subconscious has its own mechanism for creating these false images; all we do is stimulate it -- it does the rest."
Most of the story takes place in the 22nd century after analogue treatments have been universally applied for more than 100 years. The United States has broken up into semi-autonomous regions in which the analogue treatment is used to enforce whatever societal norms benefit the ruling classes. The narrative centers on Arthur Bass, who realizes at an early age that he is an "immune", i.e. resistant to the analogue treatment. Bass is identified and recruited by the members of a clandestine group of immunes who are working to overthrow the analogue system.
Critical response.
In "Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers," Thomas D. Clareson wrote:
"The chief pleasures of the novel come from Knight's inventiveness. The society he portrays is vividely exhibited."
Groff Conklin praised the novel for providing "a tense experience in a mad and tragic world of tomorrow." Anthony Boucher gave "Hell's Pavement" a mixed review, praising its "dazzling ingenuity and plausibility," but concluding that it never addup to a consecutive coherent story." P. Schuyler Miller rated it "no masterpiece, but one of the better pieces of science-fictive entertainment out this year [1955.

Costas Tsicaderis

Costas Tsicaderis (6 January 1945 – 23 December 2004) was a Greek-Australian singer-songwriter.
Biography.
Costas Tsicaderis was born in Katerini in the north of Greece in 1945, and his family migrated to Australia in 1954, when Costas was nine years old. In Greece his father ran a "taverna", but in Australia he ended up at the General Motors Holden plant in Melbourne.
Costas completed his schooling in Melbourne and became a draughtsman running his own business. Later he studied architecture at the RMIT and went on to teach the subject at Preston TAFE.
At high school Costas began to play the guitar and developed an interest in folk music. He first presented some of his compositions to audiences in 1974. In the 1980s he formed the Costas Tsicaderis Ensemble.
He had a long association with the Melbourne cultural support group and "world music café" The Boite, where he was a regular performer.
For many years he presented a weekly programme of Greek music for the community radio station 3ZZZ (mid 1990s to 2000). He also presented a programme for 3XY (late 1990s to his death).
In 2001 he produced a compilation CD for 3ZZZ funded by AMRAP. Of this he wrote: "One of the most exciting activities for me last year was my involvement as producer in 3ZZZ’s CD "Routes of Rhythm", a compilation of six exciting and previously unrecorded Melbourne groups." This was followed by a second CD "Routes of Rhythm 2", which Costas also produced.
Costas Tsicaderis died suddenly on 23 December 2004 aged 59. "The Music of Costas Tsicaderis", a feature that was produced for ABC radio in 1985, was aired again on the ABC National Radio programme "Music Deli" as a tribute. The Melbourne Greek newspaper "Neos Kosmos" named him 2004 Greek of the Year. Close friends and colleagues established The Costas Tsicaderis Memorial Foundation with the aim of providing financial assistance to promising young musicians.
A tribute concert and launch of the CD "The Mighty and the Humble" was presented by The Boite and the Costas Tsicaderis Memorial Foundation on 1 December 2006 at BMW Edge, Federation Square, Melbourne.
Musical works.
His music has been described as belonging "firmly in the popular tradition defined and developed by Hatzidakis, Theodorakis, and other Greek composers who set Greek poetry to music", and as characterised by "gentle melodies and orchestration with bitter-sweet and often nostalgic lyrics". The song "The Pomegranate" was singled out for particular praise by critics: "His setting of Dimitris Tsaloumas' poem "The Pomegranate", is a consummate example of antipodean Greek art." And: "The song as such is … superb—the lyrics and the melody are perfectly matched, and the melody has the simplicity and coherence of structure which go to make a classic."
Also singled out was his setting to music of Nikos Ninolakis’ poem "Select a Day". One critic described it as "an absolutely marvellous song," and added "I especially like the way the melody rises unexpectedly in the chorus on the word έκσταση so that in retrospect one feels that it has been killing time, waiting for that climactic, ecstatic moment."
Discography.
The Costas Tsicaderis discography includes a total of 24 songs composed by Tsicaderis himself. These are listed below, along with the name of the lyricist. In most cases, the lyrics are poems by Greek Australians which Tsicaderis set to music. The dates indicate which album(s) each song is on. Songs are in Greek unless otherwise stated.

Shyaam learns that Deva is not the security officer appointed by the police department. It is revealed that Deva is Veera, a person who is like a god to the whole village, he actually killed security officer Deva (who works for villan) and replaced him and Sathya is his step sister. In the pre-interval scene, Dhanraj comes to kill Shyam and his family, then Veera bashes them badly and protects his sister's family. But, suddenly there appears a mystery man (Pradeep Rawat) who introduces thyself as a great enemy of Veera, and shoots him. Veera loses his sense.

Audience with sensibilities won’t like it a bit". Indiaglitz wrote:"An absolutely predictable and irritatingly boring film". 123telugu wrote:"Watch it, if you are a big fan of Ravi Teja". Rediff wrote:"tedious watch". Fullhyd wrote:"Veera, well-rounded in its lousiness, does neither. And yet, it audaciously traipses on, firm in its faith that this is the blockbuster you've been waiting for all summer". sify wrote:"Veera is only fine in parts wherever Ravi Teja is shown in a mass dimension. There is unnecessary violence and the screenplay is hackneyed. Director Ramesh Varma was purely focusing to showcase Ravi Teja on the lines of a superhero but he failed miserably". Cinegoer wrote:"Veera is an extremely ordinary or routine subject with the regular thrills, frills, love and romance bereft of reality, logic, nevertheless it has its share of twists here and there that could take you by surprise". Greatandhra wrote:"this is a film which gives a stale taste of boredom even to the masses".
Box office.
The film got a good start and had a Decent run at the Box office. It completed 50 Days in 60 Centres

Pirates Week

Pirates Week is a Cayman Islands festival that is held during the month of November, usually for 11 days. In 2013 it will be held from November 7–17. When the festival's functions are in progress, some streets are closed and various parties and events and held across the islands. During Pirates Week, districts on Grand Cayman, as well as Cayman Brac and Little Cayman get to host what is called Heritage Day, a day-long event that highlights aspects of each district's distinct culture.
Beginnings.
Pirates Week was started by in 1977 by Jim Bodden, then Minister of Tourism. It was not started to celebrate actual pirate history, but to boost tourism during the country's tourism slow season. It has since grown into a major event with music, street dances, costumes, games, local food and drinks, parades, sports events and breathtaking firework displays.
Campaign to end Pirates Week.
In spite of it being a major cultural and social event, a campaign was initiated to end Pirates Week in 2009. One of the major reasons for the campaign by its supporters was that they considered Pirates Week to be promoting piracy. However, the campaign has now dissolved.

It is a one of 27 forest division in Toruń directorate, located in Kujawsko-Pomorskie province in central Poland. The headquarters of the unit is situated in Włocławek city. Since 1994 Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek is a part of Promotional Forest Complex “Gostynińsko-Włocławskie Forests”. Total area of the forest division is 25 123 ha.
History.
The current boundaries of the Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek were reactivated on the 01.01.2003 joining together both the Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek and the Forest Inspectorate of Kowal.
Since the turn of the 18th and 19th century after confiscating Royal Forests of Poland by Prussia, the Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek has been existing as an individual administrative unit. Initially, the inspectorate’s headquarters was situated in Kowal but in 1820 it was moved to Włocławek. Until the beginning of World War I the forest of Włocławek, belonged to the Russian Government Forests. In 1846 Russian Forest Department made a forestry and economic survey.
In 1918, after regaining independence by Poland, the former Russian Government Forests were taken by the State Treasure of Poland. Simultaneously, the Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek, subordinate to Management of State Forest in Warsaw, was formed
In 01.01.1973 Forest Divisions of Włocławek, Czarne and Jedwabna were reorganized and included to Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek as a 2 separate precincts.
Between the years 1995 and 2002 the forests belonging to the present forest division were divided between Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek and Forest Inspectorate of Kowal.
Natural characteristics.
Area of the Forest Inspectorate is characterized by extensive forest coverage reaching up to 38%. The main site type of forest is a coniferous sites (78%), first of all fresh coniferous forest and fresh mixed coniferous forest. The most common species is Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and also Larix decidua, Picea abies, Fagus silvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus, Alnus incana, Populus tremula, Tilia cordata. Average age of forest is 62 years old.
Administrative division.
Forest Inspectorate of Włocławek is divided into 3 forest precincts:
It consists of 15 forests districts:

Pulser pump

A pulser pump is a gas lift device that uses gravity to pump water to a higher elevation. It has no moving parts.
Operation.
A pulser pump makes use of water that flows through pipes and an air chamber from an upper reservoir to a lower reservoir. The intake is a trompe, which uses water flow to pump air to a separation chamber; air trapped in the chamber then drives an airlift pump. The top of the pipe that connects the upper reservoir to the air chamber is positioned just below the water surface. As the water drops down the pipe, air is sucked down with it. The air forms a "bubble" near the roof of the air chamber. A narrow riser pipe extends from the air chamber up to the higher elevation to which the water will be pumped.
Initially the water level will be near the roof of the air chamber. As air accumulates, pressure builds, which will push water up into the riser pipe. At some point the "air bubble" will extend below the bottom of the riser pipe, which will allow some of the air to escape through the riser, pushing the water that is already in the pipe up with it. As the air escapes, the water level in the air chamber will rise again. The alternating pressure build up and escape causes a pulsing effect, hence the name: pulser pump.
The maximum air pressure that can accumulate depends on the height of the water column between the air chamber and the lower reservoir. The deeper the air chamber is positioned, the higher the elevation to which the water can be pumped. The depth of the air chamber position is limited by the depth to which the flowing water can pull the air from the surface of the upper reservoir down to the chamber. This depth partially depends on the speed of the water, which in turn depends on the difference in height between the upper and lower reservoir.
History.
Brian White, stonemason by profession, claims to have invented the pulser pump in 1987. He put the idea in the public domain.
However, Charles H. Taylor invented the hydraulic air compressor before the year 1910 while living in Montreal. The working principle of the hydraulic air compressor and the pulser pump is exactly the same. But the purpose of the compressor is to generate compressed air. Expelling the water up to 30 meter high serves to prevent potentially damaging
over-pressure. The primary purpose of the pulser pump is to use the air pressure to expel the water to a higher elevation.

Glenford Myers

Glenford Myers (born December 12, 1946) is an American computer scientist, entrepreneur, and author. He founded two successful high-tech companies (RadiSys and IP Fabrics), authored eight textbooks in the computer sciences, and made important contributions in microprocessor architecture. He holds a number of patents, including the original patent on "register scoreboarding" in microprocessor chips. He has a BS in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, an MS in computer science from Syracuse University, and a PhD in computer science from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.
Career.
IBM.
Myers joined IBM in 1968 in its Poughkeepsie, N.Y. lab. After spending a few years working on developments associated with the System/360 mainframes, he moved to the prestigious IBM Systems Research Institute in New York City. There he headed up a small team of people developing an advanced computer system named "SWARD" (Software Oriented Architecture) incorporating such concepts as tagged storage, capability-based addressing, organization by objects, and a single-level store. The machine was built and successfully operated in 1980.
During this period, Myers also authored his first four books, including "The Art of Software Testing", a book that became a classic and a best-seller in the computer science field, staying in print for 26 years before it was replaced by a second edition in 2004. Myers also served as a lecturer in computer science at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, where he taught graduate-level courses in computer science. Years later, he was the 1988 recipient of the J.-D. Warnier Prize for his contributions to the field of software engineering.
Intel.
In early 1981 Myers was hired from IBM by the then-small company called Intel to build a new organization to head off the leadership Motorola seemed to be gaining with its "clean" 68000 chip rather than Intel's more-difficult-to-program 8086. This project, code named the "P4," became less critical to Intel when IBM, later that year, announced the IBM PC using a variant of the Intel 8086. To coordinate Intel's strategy, Myers was appointed Manager of Microprocessor Product-Line Architecture to manage a number of efforts, including the movement of the 8086 and successors to a 32-bit architecture called the Intel 80386 (386), in which Myers played a key role in making many of the early decisions, the Intel iAPX 432, a very unconventional design from Intel's team in Oregon, the Intel i860, a type of RISC vector-processing machine, and the RISC-oriented 80960 (i960). Myers also chaired Intel's Microprocessor Strategic Business Segment, part of Intel's strategic long-range planning process.
In 1983, Myers moved to Oregon to take personal charge of the design of the i960 microprocessor. The i960 was the first microprocessor chip that could execute multiple instructions in parallel. In 1986, Myers co-authored an invited paper with Intel senior vice presidents Albert Yu and Dave House that outlined Intel's microprocessor thinking for the next 10 years. In 1990, Myers, for his work on the i960 microprocessor, was one of three finalists for Discover Magazine's Awards for Technological Innovation
RadiSys.
In 1987, Myers and key i960 chip manager Dave Budde left Intel and founded RadiSys Corporation. Myers took the roles of CEO and Chairman, positions he held until 2002. A number of other Intel employees quickly joined the new venture, all of whom worked for no salary and instead invested money in the startup (in trade for stock). Because 1987 turned out to be one of the worst periods in history for raising venture capital, the early employees moonlighted to keep RadiSys afloat; for instance, Myers returned to Intel as a consultant on the design of the Intel 80486 processor chip. After operating on a shoe string for a year, RadiSys raised $6.5 million from three unconventional sources: Tektronix, State Farm Insurance, and the State of Oregon. By 1992, RadiSys had sales of over $10 million, 61 employees, and was 90th on the Inc. 500 of fastest-growing private companies. 
In 1995, RadiSys became a publicly traded company (symbol RSYS) when it held an initial public offering (IPO). The company then grew rapidly, in part because of a series of acquisitions, including a division of Intel, two small operations from IBM, and several other private companies.
In 2000, under Myers' leadership, RadiSys had revenues of $341 million, net income of $33 million, a market cap in excess of $1 billion, and 1153 employees. The company became increasingly focused on the telecommunications market, with Nokia being its largest customer and representing over 20% of its revenue. In 2002, after a series of disagreements with the board of directors, Myers left and formed IP Fabrics, and nine other key RadiSys managers and engineers quickly joined him there.
IP Fabrics.
Myers, along with nine others who left RadiSys, founded IP Fabrics in 2002 and became its CEO. He raised $8 million in venture capital from Intel Capital, Ignition Partners, Northwest Venture Associates, and Frazier Technology Partners. Initially, IP Fabrics' business was providing a virtualization environment for highly parallel network processors, with the starting point being Intel's IXP network processors. However, when Intel decided to exit this business, IP Fabrics quickly changed its direction to that of providing communications interception systems using the previously developed network-processor software and hardware within. For instance, within the U.S., IP Fabrics provides systems for intercepting voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet communications to law-enforcement agencies and telecommunications carriers for adherence to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). It also provides products for the interception of instant messaging services, social networking services, email, webmail, and other types of traffic.
Myers also serves as chairman of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance subcommittee, an organization of law-enforcement and other government agencies and telecommunications carriers and equipment suppliers that develops standards for wiretapping.
Publications.
Myers has published a number of technical papers and has authored eight texts. A selection of these follows:

Arthur Hunnable

Arthur Hunnable (fl. 1907–1921), often known as Captain Hunnable, was a British poet and minor fraudster, best known for his frequent but unsuccessful attempts to become a candidate for election to Parliament.
Living in Ilford, Hunnable worked as a bicycle and tool maker and motor engineer until March 1907. He first came to public attention at the Jarrow by-election that summer, before which he spoke widely in the town, announcing that he intended to stand as a candidate. He was nominated, but failed to deliver a £200 deposit, as required, and despite his protests, was not permitted to stand. Despite this, he continued to give popular speeches, and the Mayor of Jarrow declared that "he keeps the young and the rough element amused". Following the election, Hunnable appeared at the Empire Music Hall in Holborn in a skit reliving parts of his campaign. After a week, he quit, to speak in the run-up to the Colne Valley by-election, then moved on to the North West Staffordshire by-election. However, he did not attempt to stand, announcing that he had decided to stand at Jarrow in the next general election. He proved less popular in Staffordshire, and was fined for causing an obstruction in Hanley Market Square, and describing any hecklers as "dirty little tykes". Unable to pay the £3 demanded, he was imprisoned for a month, but was released after three days, a public subscription having raised the sum.
Hunnable next tried to stand at the Liverpool Kirkdale by-election, but announced immediately before nominations closed that all twelve of his nomination papers had been incorrectly completed, so he could not continue with his candidacy. He also spoke at the Peckham by-election, 1908, and at the North West Manchester by-election, he spoke in favour of the Conservative Party candidate William Joynson-Hicks. During the election, a carriage in which he was riding, decked out in the Conservative colours, ran into a crowd of Liberal Party supporters, and the vehicle was overturned before he made his escape.
Hunnable was known for his flamboyant style, sometimes bowing from his carriage to imaginary cheers, and lively meetings - he claimed by the end of 1909 to have given a "good hiding" to thirty-seven hecklers. He frequently employed poetry, which was widely considered of a low standard. He claimed to have schemes which would make the fortunes of those who voted for him, introduce a £2 minimum wage, reform the British Empire. At Attercliffe in 1909, he claimed that he would be forming a government within five years. He wore a frock coat, kid boots with pointed toes and a wide-awake hat.
In May 1908, Hunnable was fined £3, a guinea and costs for unlawfully leaving a donkey and cart in Romford Market and then assaulting a market employee. This did not stop him from appearing at the Wolverhampton East by-election, and speaking in Manchester on the topic of the "Social Reform Progress League" which he had supposedly founded. He announced that he would run in the Pudsey by-election, but again failed to stand. In August, he was gaoled for five weeks for failing to pay the fines imposed in May.
Hunnable re-emerged at the Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, 1909, at which he met with independent Conservative candidate Arnold Muir Wilson, but decided against supporting him until he divined a horoscope stating that Muir Wilson would win. At the end of the summer, he spoke on the beach at Blackpool, but was fined 10 shillings for knocking out a heckler. The press gradually lost interest in his activities, but by 1913, when he was fined for failing to send his daughter to school, he was the editor of his own newspaper, the "People's Parliament". He moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he claimed to have invented an unsinkable ship and a new form of airship. He attempted to stand as an independent labour candidate in Jarrow at the 1918 UK general election. In 1921, he was again gaoled, this time for fraud, having purchased a bicycle with a worthless cheque.

26 Miles (Santa Catalina)

"26 Miles (Santa Catalina)" is a popular song by the 1950s and 1960s pop band The Four Preps. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Billboard R&B chart in 1958. The song sold over a million copies and was played on "The Ed Sullivan Show".
The main theme of the song is summed up in the last line in the refrain, stating that Santa Catalina is "the island of romance", with the word "romance" repeated four times.
History.
At the age of 15, the band's lead singer Bruce Belland broke his ankle and took up the ukulele to pass the time while recuperating. He learned four chords, which ended up becoming the song's opening music. The chorus was developed some time later when, while body surfing at a California beach, Belland's friend said he could see Santa Catalina 26 miles away.
Glen Larson also receives credit for writing the song, as he contributed to the lyrics.
Cover versions.
The song was covered by Dent May on his album "Dent May & His Magnificent Ukulele".
Influences.
The song served as an influence to Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, as well as Jimmy Buffett.

Coupletist

A coupletist (kupletist) is a poet, singer, or actor who specializes in couplets - wittily ambiguous, political, or satirical songs, usually in cabaret settings, usually with refrains, generally used as a transition between two cabaret numbers.
With sarcasm and humor, coupletists take on political dignitaries, the prevailing zeitgeist and lifestyle, in short, "all of the world's madness." Friedrich Wolf called the couplet "the direct involvement of the audience in the game."
"In the cinemas, besides films there would also appear the touring so-called kupletists (singers of topical, satirical songs) - Vasily Pravdin, Gregory Marmeladov and others. Kolya and I enjoyed the kupletists very much and, buying their librettos, zealously studied their soliloquies in order to recite them with feeling to our ladies. ... It was supper time and all of us children sat at the table, mama pouring tea from the samovar boiling on the table. ... I, holding in my hand the libretto of a kupletist, was reciting one of his soliloquies at the top of my voice. Unable to stand my noise, mama entreated me to quiet down and when this did not help, she tore the libretto from my hands and stuck it into the pipe of the samovar, where the fire consumed it.
The Wiener Couplet is a little song found in the farces and comedies of Viennese popular theater. The couplet interrupts the action on stage, is directly addressed to the audience and has reflections on various subjects often unrelated to the plot. While the couplet is sung, "dramatic time" stands still. The actor leaves his role to act as the writer's accomplice, interacting directly with the audience. The actor uses a send-up of his personal problems to make general comments on social and political grievances or human character flaws. 
Michael Tilson Thomas was "... amused by the sheer amount of improvised satirical and topical couplets by his grandparents Boris and Bessie Thomashevsky ... the modernity of the Thomashefsky improvisations a century ago in the Yiddish theater was remarkably reminiscent of those on Saturday Night Live."
In Yiddish theater, the "kuplét" was "the comedian's almost obligatory comic patter song." It duplicates vaudeville's intense rapport between performer and audience.
"For a contemporary example, one verse of the naughty "kuplét" of "Money, Love and Shame", sung by a clever comedian in Tel Aviv in 1975, makes fun of Brezhnev, to the delight of an audience of recent immigrants from Russia ... Jacob Jacobs over to the audience, in the course of a "kuplét", to commiserate with someone in the first row on his Galician accent - always good for a laugh. Another of his perennial routines is to sing a verse about a man who is cuckolded or impotent, peer out into the audience, and ask someone why his wife is laughing so hard.

Abid Surti

Abid Surti or Aabid Surti (; ; born 5 May 1935) is a National Award-winning Indian author who has earned accolades within India and abroad as a painter, author, cartoonist, journalist, environmentalist, playwright and screenwriter besides being a "one-man" NGO out to save every drop of water.
Writings.
Surti has written short stories, novels, plays, children's books and travelogues. Several of his books have been translated into regional languages. He has also been writing for Hindi and Gujarati newspapers and magazines for over 40 years and won a National Award for his short-story collection "Teesri Aankh" in 1993. He became an author by accident. When his first love broke down due to family pressure, the teenaged Aabid had no one to confide in – so he began putting his story on paper. The story was published in Gujarati in 1965 as "Tootela Farishta" (Fallen angels) and proved to be an unexpected success.
He has written more than 80 books, including 45 novels, 10 short story collections and 7 plays.
The autobiographical novel "Musalman" was an account of his childhood in the poverty-ridden Dongri area of Mumbai. His latest novel, "Sufi", describes the parallel lives of two friends: the author himself and a man called Iqbal Rupani, who rose to become the kingpin of the Mumbai underworld in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1975, his fictional version based on the "Devil's Bible", entitled "The Black Book", created a nationwide controversy. Even amidst critical acclaim, it was translated into seven languages and voted Book of the Year in Kannada. He earned the nickname the "Salman Rushdie of India" after his "Black Book" was published. He has together with his son Aalif Surti and Chandrika Vyas, Rima Kashyap also penned a controversial and hard-hitting novel called "In Name of Rama" inspired by a true incident during the demolition of the Babri Masjid.
In 2007, he was awarded the "Hindi Sahitya Sanstha Award" by the Uttar Pradesh government, and was given an award by the Gujarat government for his children's literary work "Rangat". Among his other novels are "Canal" and "Daagh". He has also worked as a television and film script-writer. He was the editor of the Gujarati annual magazine "Dayaro" for many years.
Recently, he has sued the makers of the Bollywood film "Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge", which he says used his Gujarati novel "Bauter Varas No Babo", published in 1976 and later translated into Hindi as "Bahatar Saal Ka Baccha".
He has written graphic children's novels in Hindi, including "Buddh kyun muskuraye 2500 saal baad" (Why did the Buddha smile after 2500 years).

His using of acrylic colours applied to Italian art paper are also said to be indeed out of this world. An accomplished painter, he has held 16 exhibitions in India and abroad. In his early years, he invented an innovative technique called "mirror collage" which won critical acclaim in Japan. In 1971, the Indian government commissioned a short film to showcase his creative work.
Cartoons and comic-books.
The first cartoon characters he created were in 1952-53 for a Gujarati magazine "Ramakadu". It consisted of a comic feature of four pages in colour with three prominent characters – a boy, a girl and a monkey, entitled "Rang Lakhudi". As a cartoonist, he later created the lovable simpleton "Dhabbuji". The highly original and popular cartoon strip has been one of the longest-running comic strips in India, running without a break for over 30 years. It was the weekly comic strip that first appeared in famous Hindi magazine "Dharmyug". He also created another popular comic book character, "Bahadur", which achieved a large fan following, when the comics started to be published in Indrajal Comics from 1978. He also created other comic book characters like Inspector Azad, Inspector Vikram and a lady character named Shuja. The cartoon "Dhabbuji" and comics of "Bahadur", "Inspector Azad", "Inspector Vikram" and "Shuja" were all also published in English. Raj Kapoor once wanted to make a film based on "Inspector Azad", such was the popularity of his comic strips. Further, his famous comic strips "Doctor Chinchoo Ke Chamatkar", which was published in the Hindi magazine "Parag" from 1963 to 1965 is being serialized by the National Book Trust as "Doctor Chinchoo Ke Kaarnamein".

Discover Bank v. Superior Court (30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76) is a 2005 case where the California Supreme Court ruled that an arbitration clause was unenforceable because a class-action waiver contained within it would exculpate Discover Bank from liability for wrongdoing involving small sums of damages. Carlos R. Moreno, in the majority opinion, stated the Discover Bank test to determine whether a class-action waiver is unenforceable. In the Discover Bank test, a class-action waiver will be unenforceable under California law when it appears in a "consumer contract of adhesion," when the disputes "predictably involve small amounts of damages," and where the plaintiff alleges that "the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money."

USCGC Point League (WPB-82304)

USCGC "Point League" (WPB-82304) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1960 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as "WPB-82304" when commissioned and acquired the name "Point League" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .
Construction and design details.
"Point League" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point League" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13 man crew were installed for Vietnam service.
History.
After delivery in 1960, "Point League" was assigned a homeport of Morgan City, Louisiana, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. 
At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, "Point League" was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refit for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M-2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.
While finishing training exercises at Subic Bay the main drive engine alarms sounded on the bridge and during an investigation by the cutter's engineers it was found that major damage had occurred to one of the main drive engines. Overhaul parts were sent from Division 12 in Danang and the cutter engineers completed the overhaul and initial run-in of the engine in 72 hours, just in time for the scheduled departure of the division for Vietnam. The final break-in of the repaired engine was completed while in transit. 
"Point League" was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Navy Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the Rung Sat Special Zone. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board.
On 20 June 1966 "Point League" along with "Point Hudson" and "Point Slocum" assisted with the capture of a North Vietnamese trawler loaded with ammunition near the mouth of the Cổ Chiên River.
During the month of September 1966 "Point League" responded to a distress call from the SS "Dragonfly" by helping dewater a flooded compartment and putting one of the cutter's engineers on the merchant ship temporarily to replace the injured chief engineer.
As a part of the Vietnamization Program South Vietnamese Navy crewmen were assigned to the cutter for training purposes beginning in February 1969. After the crew of "Point League" trained a Vietnamese replacement crew, she was turned over to the Republic of Vietnam Navy as a part of the Vietnamization Program and recommissioned as RVNS "Lê Phước Đức" (HQ-700), 16 May 1969 at the Saigon Navy Base. She was the first Squadron One cutter to be turned over to Vietnamese control, the second being which was turned over during the same recommissioning ceremony.

Donald Ross Skinner

Donald Skinner is a guitarist, songwriter and producer born in Edinburgh, UK primarily known for his work with Julian Cope. Skinner is commonly known by the name Donald Ross Skinner with the addition of the middle name of "Ross" attributed to him by Cope after Glenn Ross Campbell, the pedal steel player from The Misunderstood. He is currently a guitarist for Love Amongst Ruin and DC Fontana.
Pre-Cope career.
Skinner played in a number of Tamworth bands including The Fretz, DHSS (named after the Department of Health and Social Security) and Freight train.
Julian Cope Band.
After the split of The Teardrop Explodes Julian retreated to his home town of Tamworth and the 18-year-old Skinner visited the singer's home on a number of occasions. Skinner was subsequently invited to join Cope's band and to play on a Kid Jensen radio session. Skinner played on the "Fried" album and was Cope's main collaborator on the 4 albums subsequently released on Island Records. Skinner was a mainstay in Cope's touring band throughout this period.
For the "Peggy Suicide" and "Jehovahkill" albums Skinner switched to bass and keys (whilst Cope played lead guitar) and he is also credited as co-producer. Both of these albums are regarded as high points in the singer's solo career.
A disagreement between Cope and the guitarist meant that the 1994 album "Autogeddon" was the last time they collaborated on record (although Skinner is credited on the "20 Mothers" album).
Skinner returned to play on two further tours with Cope, first with the pair backed by a drum machine in 2000 and in a full band line up in 2004.
Post-Cope career.
Skinner auditioned to play in Spiritualized alongside Cope keyboard player Thighpaulsandra but was passed over in favour of Doggen who has played guitar as a member of Cope's band. During 2000 Skinner played live in the band Fiji with Jamie Hince (Scarfo/The Kills). Since then he has been a member of a number of bands including Prolapse and Kiosk
and received production credits working with Salad, Tiger, DC Fontana, Strangelove and Cud.
More recently he has appeared on releases by David Holmes (bass on The Holy Pictures), The Enemy (bass and guitar on Hugo Nicolson's remix of 'This Song' 2008), Yellowhammer, Claire Nicolson and My Toys Like Me.
Skinner is currently playing guitar with Love Amongst Ruin, a band formed by ex-Placebo drummer Steve Hewitt. He also writes and plays with Amp alongside Paul Kennedy, ex of Salad. In 2013, Skinner undertook production work for British band DC Fontana's second album and joined in the band in October 2013.

Longevity risk

A longevity risk is any potential risk attached to the increasing life expectancy of pensioners and policy holders, which can eventually translate in higher than expected pay-out-ratios for many pension funds and insurance companies.
One important risk to individuals who are spending down savings, is that they will live longer than expected and thus exhaust their savings, dying in poverty or burdening relatives. This is also referred to as "outliving one's savings" or "outliving one's assets."
Individuals.
Individuals often underestimate longevity risk – in the United States, most retirees do not expect to live past 85, but this is in fact the median conditional life expectancy for men at 65 (half of 65-year old men will live to 85 or older, and more women will).
Low interest rates and declining returns exacerbating longevity risk.
The collapse in returns on government bonds is taking place against the backdrop of a protracted fall in returns for other core-assets such as blue chip stocks, and, more importantly, a silent demographic shock. Factoring in the corresponding longevity risk, pension premiums could be raised significantly while disposable incomes stagnate and employees work longer years before retiring.

Stannon stone circle

Stannon stone circle, Stannon circle or Stannon is a stone circle located near St. Breward on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, UK.
Description.
Stannon takes its name from the nearby farm and is sited between two streams on the gentle slopes of Dinnever Hill, two and a half miles southeast of Camelford. It is overlooked on one side by a massive china clay works that now blights the landscape. The circle's remoteness is part of its charm with only the wild animals of the moor likely to be encountered.
One of the first surveys of the area was carried out in 1906 by the British Association and it is a fine example of a Cornish ring containing 47 upright stones, 30 recumbent and 2 displaced within an impressive by metre circle with four outlying, jagged stones. The stones average size is c and are closely spaces with the largest stone in the group having a base width of over . Like Fernacre, Stannon is an example of Alexander Thom's "Type A flattened circle", being noticeably flattened on the north side. The circle dates from either the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. Aubrey Burl and contended that they may be earlier in date than other circles in the southern area of the moors such as the Stripple stones. John Barnatt suggested this dating and surveyed the site.
Archaeology.
Excavations in the area of Stannon Down were carried out by R. J. Mercer in the late 1960s. He was able to study eight unenclosed round house sites that were suggested to be a settlement of over twenty, approximately to metres in diameter covering an area of approximately x with fields for farming along with rectangular enclosures tentatively identified as corrals or used for stock control and have shown that the area would have been close to mixed oak woodlands and oaks would have grown in the area that would probably have been cleared in the first phases of settlement. Houses were constructed of posts, supporting thatched roofs, partitioned with wood with paved or compressed earth floors, incorporating drainage and furniture. Pottery, flint tools were discovered along with a whetstone that suggested the possibility of metal blades. The settlement was estimated to have a population of around one hundred people and dated to the Middle Bronze Age, a later date than suggested for the circle itself.
Alignments.
When standing in the supposed centre of Stannon Circle, a point between twenty-two and twenty-eight degrees north from east is marked by Rough Tor. Matthew Gregory Lewis found a relation of these monuments to the neighbouring hills which indicated that they were designed with special consideration of the position of the sunrise at certain times of year. Andy M. Jones reviews studies of the area and called Stannon a Ceremonial Complex.

Vermont State Hospital

Vermont State Hospital, alternately known as the Vermont State Asylum for the Insane and the Waterbury Asylum, was a mental institution built in 1890 in Waterbury, Vermont to help relieve overcrowding at the privately run Vermont Asylum for the Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, now known as the Brattleboro Retreat. Originally intended to treat the criminally insane, the hospital eventually took in patients with a wide variety of problems, including mild to severe mental disabilities, epilepsy, depression, alcoholism and senility.
History.
During the tenure of Dr. Eugene A. Stanley as superintendent (1918–1936), the hospital expanded – the patient population peaked at 1,728 in the mid-1930s – constructing a new three-story building specifically for the treatment of women. Stanley, who was a public advocate of eugenics, espoused forced sterilization and advised the Eugenics Society, to whom he provided patient records.
The property was flooded in November, 1927. In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene flooded the property above predicted 100-year level.
In 1963, the population started to decline. Empty floor space was converted into state offices.
Operations.
As of 2012, the Hospital is affiliated with the University of Vermont/Fletcher Allen Health Care Department of Psychiatry, and several other colleges and universities, and runs a training program, the Vera A. Hanks School of Psychiatric Technology.

During World War I, the German Spitz was renamed the American Eskimo Dog, and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, freedom fries was a short-lived political euphemism for French fries, used by some to express their disapproval of the French opposition to the invasion.
Ethnic groups.
Some ethnic groups in the US have been periodically renamed - principally Native Americans and Black Americans.
Native Americans
"Native Americans" have been referred to as "American Indians", "Indigenous", and "Amerind".
"Alaska Natives" have been referred to as "Eskimos", and now prefer the individual names of their ethnic groups, such as Yupik or Iñupiat (Inuit).
Black Americans
For Black Americans, the term "colored" was widely used until the second quarter of the 20th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, "colored" was considered outmoded and generally gave way to the use of "negro". By the 1940s, the term commonly was capitalized, Negro.
By the mid-1960s, Negro was considered disparaging. During the late 1960s to the early 1970s, some people favoured usage of the term ""Afro-American"".
During the 1980s, the term "African American" was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth. It ultimately received mainstream use after Jesse Jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.
Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for "African American" or "Black," although they have a slight preference for "Black" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.

Nine-Mile Island (Mississippi River)

Nine-Mile Island is a river island located in Mosalem Township, Dubuque County, Iowa, between Dubuque, Iowa and Bellevue, Iowa on the Upper Mississippi River.
Geography.
Nine-Mile Island is situated within Pool 12 of the Upper Mississippi River, between Locks and Dams Nos. 11 and 12. The head (northwestern end) of the island is at UMR river mile 574.3, with the southeastern end at mile 571.5. It is about 2 miles long and .5 mile at its widest point, with a total area of 454 acres.
The island is immediately downriver from Frentress Lake, site of a popular marina in East Dubuque, Illinois and the former dock of the Silver Eagle Casino. It is adjacent to the unincorporated community of Massey, Iowa, which houses marina facilities. The island is bordered on the southwest by Molo Slough and on the northeast by the USACE's nine-foot navigation channel. Since it is on the Mississippi River, Nine-Mile Island is on the extreme eastern side of Iowa, adjacent to its border with Illinois.
The USACE also maintains two aids to navigation on the island: Nine-Mile Island Daybeacon at UMR river mile 573.5, and Nine-Mile Island Light at mile 571.5, both on the right descending bank.
History.
The island's name comes from the fact that its head is located nine river miles below Eagle Point (). It was also historically known as Shinkles Island, as evidenced by the Army Corps' Shinkles Island Bar Daybeacon at UMR mile 574.1 on the left descending bank (Illinois side of the river).
The island was also the site of a steamboat race in 1885 between the DAN THAYER and CLYDE.
Conservation.
Nine-Mile Island is densely forested, save for a sandy beach at the head of the island which is popular with vacationers. The area is characterized by numerous sloughs and backwaters, and the island surrounds Horseshoe Lake and Green Lake. Classified as public land, the island is part of both the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge and the Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge.
Prior to the construction of dams on the Upper Mississippi, thousands of wingdams regulated the flow of the river. Multiple remnants of these common structures are still present near the island. There is also a 1/2-mile revetment on the north side of the island and a 1/4-mile revetment on the southeastern end.
Recreation.
Since the island is just southeast of the Dubuque metropolitan area, it is a popular destination for boaters and picnickers. There are no roads on the island. Boats must be careful not to drop anchor at the head of the island, since there is an underground natural gas pipeline buried there, formerly owned by Enron Gas Pipeline Co.

Marske Pioneer

The Marske Pioneer is a family of American, single-seat, mid-wing, tailless gliders that was designed by Jim Marske. The Pioneer II version was available as plans and in kit form from Marske Aircraft Corporation for amateur construction.
Design and development.
The first Pioneer began as an aircraft construction project of Walt MacFarlane in 1965, but he did not complete the aircraft. The partially completed project was purchased by Bill Daniels and Jim Marske in 1967, who completed it and first flew the aircraft in 1968. That prototype, serial number 1, registered N7910 was still registered to Daniels in 2011.
In its original configuration the Pioneer had a wingspan. The aircraft was constructed with a wood and doped fabric wing, with the fuselage made from steel tube and fiberglass. The design features a fixed monowheel landing gear, flaps for glide-path control and spoilers for roll control instead of the more usual ailerons.
The original Pioneer was modified with wing extensions, bringing the span to and it was re-designated the Pioneer 1A. In this configuration the aircraft can fly as slowly as or as fast as .
The original design was simplified for homebuilt construction, retaining the wood and fabric wing construction, but the fuselage was changed to a fiberglass structure. The wingspan was shortened to to allow the wings to be built in a standard deep garage. Unlike on the original design, roll control was changed to ailerons, with upper surface spoilers paired with lower surface dive brakes for glidepath control. Because the aircraft is tailless the centre of gravity range is very narrow. To simplify weight and balance considerations the monowheel landing gear is located on the desired C of G and the pilot's seat is adjustable fore-and-aft. The pilot simply moves the seat until the aircraft balances on the wheel to ensure that the balance is within the center-of-gravity range. The empty weight is with a gross weight of . The aircraft manages a 35:1 glide ratio and a minimum sink of .
Starting in 1972 the Pioneer II was made available as plans or as a kit. The kit included a pre-made fiberglass fuselage shell. Reported building times range from 600 to 2000 hours. At least one Pioneer II was modified with a wingspan.
Marske has built a prototype Pioneer III, an all-composite variant of the basic design. The Pioneer III is intended to be lighter than the Pioneer II, produce a 20% drag reduction and be optimized for flight in weak lift conditions.
Operational history.
Pioneer IIs have made flights of over .
In March 2011 there were seven Pioneer IIs registered in the USA, along with the original Pioneer IA and the prototype Pioneer 3. In March 2011 there were four Pioneer IIs registered in Canada.

St. Mary's Catholic Cathedral (Cheyenne, Wyoming)

St. Mary's Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
In 1906, construction of Cheyenne's new Catholic cathedral began with Nebraska's Fisher and Lowery as its architects. The necessary funds and the site for construction were acquired by Bishop James J. Keane and Reverend James A. Duffy. 5,000 people came to watch the laying of the cornerstone on Sunday July 7, 1907. On January 31, 1909, the Cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Maurice Francis Burke of St. Joseph, Missouri, and by Bishop John Patrick Carroll of Helena, Montana.
Two side galleries, a choir loft, a vestibule, and a sacristy were built to complete the cathedral. Large arches of steel and concrete trimmed with oak were stretched across the ceiling of the sanctuary to add to the architectural beauty. 
The building's total expenses equaled $125,000 and was debt-free when completed. The building's stained glass windows were imported from Europe. These were donated as memorials. The large Madonna window in the choir loft was also imported from Europe and was a gift of the Knights of Columbus.

Yarchen Gar

Yarchen Monastery (tib ཡ་ཆེན་སྒར་ wylie ya chen sgar) lies 400 km west of Chengdu in Sichuan province in China, in the old Tibetan province of Kham. It is reported to have 10 000 monks and nuns, making it possibly the largest monastery in the world. Larung Gar is even larger, but is considered a monastic encampment rather than a monastery. Most of the inhabitants are nuns. It was established in 1985.
Many monks and nuns came to Yarchen Gar when Larung Gar was partly demolished in 2001
The abbot, Achuk Rinpoche is one of the seniormost Nyingma masters in Tibet and he practices mainly Dzogchen. He teaches in both Tibetan and Chinese language and attracts students from all over China.
Due to Chinese restrictions on religious practice most of the monks and nuns are not officially recognized and live in fear of being thrown out. Monks are not allowed to enter the nuns' quarters on the West side of the river.
Due to the remoteness of the institute and the bad condition of roads leading there, Yarchen Gar sees very few tourists. In the past years officials have often prevented foreigners from entering the institute or staying there overnight. Tourist guides will not take foreigners to the nuns' side of the river even though there are no legal or real cultural reasons against that. There is a simple hotel and restaurant next to the gate.

Spike directivity

Spike directivity is a vector that quantifies changes in transient charge density during action potential propagation.
The digital-like uniformity of action potentials is contradicted by experimental data. Electrophysiologists have observed that the shape of recorded action potentials changes in time. Recent experimental evidence has shown that action potentials in neurons are subject to waveform modulation while they travel down axons or dendrites. The action potential waveform can be modulated by neuron geometry, local alterations in the ion conductance, and other biophysical properties including neurotransmitter release.

Cross-cultural leadership

Cross-cultural psychology attempts to understand how individuals of different cultures interact with each other (Abbe et al., 2007). Along these lines, cross-cultural leadership has developed as a way to understand leaders who work in the newly globalized market. Today’s international organizations require leaders who can adjust to different environments quickly and work with partners and employees of other cultures (House et al., 2001). It cannot be assumed that a manager who is successful in one country will be successful in another (Javidan et al., 2006; Brodbeck et al., 2000). 
The following sections discuss the various aspects of cross-cultural leadership including: related theories and research, definitions of the construct itself and characteristics that are exhibited from such leaders, and antecedents to and implications of being a cross-cultural leader.
Related Theories and Research.
Implicit Leadership Theory.
The Implicit Leadership Theory (ILT) asserts that people’s underlying assumptions, stereotypes, beliefs and schemas influence the extent to which they view someone as a good leader. Since people across cultures tend to hold different implicit beliefs, schemas and stereotypes, it would seem only natural that their underlying beliefs in what makes a good leader differ across cultures (Javidan et al., 2006; Brodbeck et al., 2000).
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions.
One of the most prominent and influential studies to date regarding leadership in a globalized world is the Hofstede dimensions of culture. The study reveals similarities as well as differences across cultures and emphasizes the need to be open-minded to understand the differences in other cultures. Hofstede and Hofstede (2005) utilize five dimensions of culture to compare cultures to give leaders an understanding of how to adjust their leadership styles accordingly. These dimensions include Individualism/Collectivism, Feminine/Masculine, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long Term/ Short Term orientation.
GLOBE.
The Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research Project (GLOBE) study incorporated both the ILT and Hofstede's dimensions into one unique research study. The GLOBE study extended the ILT to include individuals of a common culture maintaining a relatively stable common belief about leaders, which varies from culture to culture. They labeled this the Culturally Endorsed Implicit Leadership Theory (CLT) (Javidan et al., 2006). The GLOBE study came up with the nine dimensions of Uncertainty Avoidance, Power Distance, Collectivism I: Societal Collectivism, Collectivism II: In-Group Collectivism, Gender Egalitarianism, Assertiveness, Future Orientation, Performance Orientation and Humane Orientation (House, Javidan, &Dorfman, 2001). Some of those dimensions correlate with the respective dimension from Hofstede. However, they differ since the GLOBE dimensions distinguish between cultural values and cultural practices, as opposed to Hofstede.
Leadership Styles Across Cultures.
Leadership is a universal phenomenon (Bass, 1997). That is, wherever there are people, there are leaders. The question here is not whether leadership exists across cultures, but do various leadership styles (paternalistic leadership, transformational leadership, transactional leadership) translate across cultures?
Paternalistic Leadership.
Paternalistic leadership “combines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence and moral integrity couched in a ‘personalistic’ atmosphere” (Farh & Cheng, 2000, p. 94). Paternalistic leadership is composed of three main elements: authoritarianism, benevolence, and moral leadership (Farh & Cheng). At its roots, paternalistic leadership refers to a hierarchical relationship in which the leader takes personal interest in the workers’ professional and personal lives in a manner resembling a parent, and expects loyalty and respect in return (Gelfand, Erez, & Aycan, 2007). 
A great deal of research has been conducted on the prevalence of this leadership style in non-Western business organizations, indicating the prevalence of paternalistic leadership in countries like China and Taiwan (Pellegrini & Scandura, 2008). However, considerably less research has been done on whether paternalistic leadership exists in Western cultures. Recently, there has been an increase in the amount of attention placed on paternalistic leadership in non-Western cultures. Although it is a relatively new area of focus in leadership research, evidence has been found supporting the relationship between paternalism and positive work attitudes in numerous cultures, including the Middle East, Latin America, and Pacific Asia (Pellegrini & Scandura, 2008). In a recent study, Pellegrini, Scandura, and Jayaraman (2010) examined paternalism in the Western business context and found that paternalistic leadership was positively associated with job satisfaction in India, but not in the United States. In both Indian and United States cultures, paternalistic leadership was positively related to leader-member exchange and organizational commitment (Pellegrini, Scandura & Jayaraman, 2010). Based on recent cross-cultural studies, paternalistic leadership seems to be more apparent across cultures than previously believed. Further research is needed to explore how prevalent it is, and how individual characteristics may play a role in where paternalistic leadership is found.
Transformational & Transactional Leadership.
In addition to paternalistic leadership, other well-known leadership styles include transformational and transactional leadership. Transformational leadership is loosely defined as a charismatic leadership style that rallies subordinates around a common goal with enthusiasm and support. Transactional leadership is characterized by a give and take relationship using rewards as an incentive. These concepts were introduced by Bass (1985) and have been updated and studied throughout the years, claiming the transferability of these types of leadership styles across cultures. In fact, Bass and Avolio (1994) went as far as to give an optimal leadership profile for leaders around the world. 
Shahin and Wright (2004) decided to test this theory in Egypt, an emerging market that had yet to be studied. In a questionnaire study of employees at 10 different banks, responses indicated that only 3 of the 7 factors that were found in the ideal leadership style in Egypt corresponded with the US factors. The other 4 were unique to Egypt or perhaps the Middle East in general. These results indicate an inability to assume that transactional and transformational leadership will succeed in non-western cultures. Casimir, Waldman, Bartram, and Yang (2006) similarly found that these leadership styles may not be as universal as some assume. In a study of transactional and transformational leadership in China and Australia, results indicated that transformational leadership significantly predicted performance and trust in the Australian population, while only predicting trust, and not performance in the Chinese population. Transactional leadership did not predict trust or performance in either population. This is another indication that these theories may not be as universal as proposed.
In opposition to the above findings, Walumbwa, Lawler, and Avolio (2007) compared data from China, India, Kenya, and the U.S. and found a strong presence of transformational and/or transactional leadership in these countries. Allocentrists, similar to collectivists, respond more positively to transformational leadership because they unite individuals around a common goal. Idiocentrists, essentially individuals found in individualistic cultures, are more amenable to transactional leaders who reward individuals for hard work and success and less amenable to leaders who encourage group work and reduce individual identity. Although these leadership styles are not appropriate in every country, this study shows that as long as the appropriate style of leadership (either transactional or transformational) is used in the correct country, followers will respond positively. Further studies should be conducted for consensus.
Definitions.
Organizational leadership and culture.
In the leadership literature, there is a lack of consensus over how to define and refer to cross-cultural leadership. In the GLOBE study, researchers don’t specifically define cross-cultural leadership; rather they outline it in two components; organizational leadership and culture. The authors describe organizational leadership as “the ability of an individual to influence, motivate, and enable others to contribute toward the effectiveness and success of the organizations of which they are members” (House et al., p. 494). The authors note that there is no universal definition for culture, but GLOBE’s definition includes “shared motives, values, beliefs, identities, and interpretations or meanings of significant events that result from common experiences of members of collectives and are transmitted across age generations” (House et al., p. 494-495).
International executive.
Another term for a cross-cultural leader, as used by Spreitzer, McCall Jr., and Mahoney (1997), is international executive. They define an international executive as “an executive who is in a job with some international scope, whether in an expatriate assignment or in a job dealing with international issues more generally” (p. 7).
Global Leadership.
Osland, Bird, Mendenhall, and Osland, (2006) define global leadership as “a process of influencing the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors of a global community to work together synergistically toward a common vision and common goals” (p. 204). In 2002 these authors conducted another study which found six core dimensions of competencies of a global leader: cross-cultural relationship skills, traits and values, cognitive orientation, global business expertise, global organizing expertise and visioning. 
As you can see, there is not one right way to define and refer to a cross-cultural leader. What is important to note is that these various terms and definitions have a similar underlying meaning. Whichever term you use, the underlying theme is that cross-cultural leadership involves the ability to influence and motivate people’s attitudes and behaviors in the global community to reach a common organizational goal.
Operationalizations.
As the previous section demonstrates, researchers use many terms to refer to the construct of cross-cultural leadership. Although these terms may differ slightly, it is important to be able to operationalize, or define cross-cultural leadership in a way that allows its presence or absence to be measured. The following studies discuss the knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors that are exhibited by successful cross-cultural leaders. 
In researching the international executive, Spreitzer et al. (1997) found that general intelligence, business knowledge, interpersonal skills, commitment, courage and ease in dealing with cross-cultural issues are traits that seem to resonate throughout the literature in illustrating a successful international executive. They indicated a lack of academic research predictors of “international executive” success, but agree that open personality, flexibility, drive and language skills all contribute to a successful international executive.
Rather than delineating a term for the leader, Rentsch, Mot, and Abbe (2009) describe a specific trait that is attributed to multicultural leadership known as multicultural perspective taking. This is detailed as the ability of such leaders to “take the perspective of another within the cultural context, to apply cultural lenses, and to adapt quickly when encountering individuals or groups from unfamiliar cultures” (p. 1). 
Gelfand, Erez, and Aycan (2007) interpret the overall behaviors that a cross-cultural leader should embody as cross-cultural organizational behavior (OB). This is defined as “cross-cultural similarities and differences in processes and behaviors at work, and the dynamics of cross-cultural interfaces in multicultural domestic and international contexts” (p. 480). 
Johnson, Lenartowicz, and Apud (2006) discuss such behavior using a similar construct referred to as cross-cultural competence (CC). CC in international business refers to “an individual’s effectiveness in drawing upon a set of knowledge, skills, and personal attributes in order to work successfully with people from different national cultural backgrounds at home or abroad” (p. 530). The focus here is not on acquiring knowledge, but rather on how the individual uses knowledge he/she already has acquired. International business can be tough and trying but it is the extent to which a leader can persevere and utilize the knowledge he/she has that makes him/her successful. 
In a similar study conducted by Abbe, et al. (2007), this same concept of cross-cultural competence (here referred to as 3C), was found to enable leaders to interact in any culture, as opposed to language and regional knowledge, which only work in specific cultures. 3C, as researched by Abbe et al. (2007), is dynamic and subject to develop over time. The authors established three components of cross-cultural competence, which include knowledge and cognition, cultural awareness, cross-cultural schema and cognitive complexity. Abbe et al. (2007) found that a leader will be successful working in another culture if personal, work, and interpersonal domains are met.
As the previously discussed studies demonstrate, there are many characteristics and behaviors that lead someone to be an effective cross-cultural leader, be it general cognitive ability, interpersonal skills, cultural awareness, or multicultural perspective taking. What is important to note is that encompassing one of these traits independently does not guarantee you will be a successful cross-cultural leader. An effective cross-cultural leader must have a well-rounded skill set and understanding of the differences that exist among people from different backgrounds.
Antecedents.
In today’s world, the business market extends beyond the local shops in front of your house, beyond your neighborhood, beyond your state, even beyond your country. With the emergence of technologies such as the Internet and text messaging, the global market is at everyone’s fingertips. More recently, international trade has grown due to “the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the creation of a single Europe, the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) …a single European currency…and the emergence of the US from an economic recession” (Johnson, et al. 2006, p. 525). The world now consists of jetsetters and Fortune 500 companies, military and government services, and developmental organizations that extend into multiple regions of the world. 
The studies conducted to develop these cultural variables attempted to understand the cultural differences and predict an overall impact on leadership. In order to achieve this perspective on culture and notice the similarities and differences, one needs to first understand one’s own culture to relate and compare it to others (Gelfand et al., 2007; Javidan et al., 2006). The larger the gap between these cultures, the more difficult it will be for the leader to adapt (Yamazaki & Kayes, 2004).
According to Gelfand, et al. (2007) globalization is “the economic interdependence among countries that develops through cross-national flows of goods, services, capital, knowhow, and people” (p. 481). Osland, et al. (2006) claim that the term global refers to more than just geographic location but rather it encompasses cultural and intellectual reach which deals with business operations, people, and the development of a global frame of mind. With a greater understanding of globalization and global organizations, we can now move on to its effects on leadership within these organizations.
Implications for practice.
Implications of this need for cross-cultural leaders can be seen in the human resource departments within these global organizations. There is a strong agreement across the literature that the selection process plays a key role in hiring the people who will be most effective cross-cultural leaders. The articles detail specific personality traits and individual differences that promote quality cross-cultural leadership for multicultural settings. They also all emphasize across the board the need to hire individuals who already have prior extensive international experience, beyond vacationing in a given country. (Abbe et al. 2007; Johnson et al., 2006; Kealey & Protheroe, 1996; Mintzberg & Gossling, 2002; Osland "et al." 2006; Spreitzer et al. 1997; Yamazaki & Kayes, 2004)
Additionally, there have been many studies published regarding the effect of intercultural training on expatriate success. While some disagree and question the effectiveness of training, most authors indicate that there is some, if only minor, success factor in intercultural training. There is no disagreement about the need for intercultural sensitivities and communication skills; it is the process of attaining these skills that is in question (Spreitzer, McCall Jr., & Mahoney, 1997; Mintzberg & Gosling, 2002; Hechanova et al., 2003; Kealey and Protheroe, 1996).
Spreitzer, McCall Jr., Mahoney (1997) believe that executives attain these skills through continuous learning, and an array of differentiated projects and experiences which all lead to an accumulated knowledge. Mintzberg and Gosling (2002) agree that executives learn through experience and note that they get to their level because of those experiences. They add that it would be detrimental to the executives to remove them from their experiential learning to sit them in a classroom and instead encourage a learning technique that incorporates classroom learning during short breaks from their job, roughly two weeks of every sixteen months. Hechanova et al. (2003) add that in effective cross-cultural training that is provided by many organizations is actually more detrimental than none at all.
According to Kealey and Protheroe (1996), the three most important ingredients to successful work overseas include the aptitudes and motivations of the expatriate and his immediate family, the aptitudes and motivation of the local counterparts and the overall organization of the project (p. 144). Therefore, while training is important, only a piece of one of the three aspects, expatriate’s personal aptitudes, can be altered by training. In addition, there needs to be recognition that training is meant to enhance abilities that are already there. Leaders need to come into training courses with abilities of their own and be open to alteration and growth from the training program.

St Elmo Courts

St Elmo Courts was a residential high rise building constructed in 1930 in the city centre of Christchurch, New Zealand. Used mainly as an office building in later years, it had a Category II heritage listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. It was demolished in March 2011, having suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and more damage in the subsequent February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.
History.
The site of the building, on the corner of Worcester and Montreal Streets, was occupied by the St Elmo Boarding House. It was advertised as "superior private accommodation". A replacement building, St Elmo Courts, was designed in 1929 by B. J. Ager. This reflected a movement in the larger New Zealand cities in the 1920s and 1930s for apartment living. The appeals were inexpensive living in a central location, with apartments offering modern conveniences and built in furniture. St Elmo Courts was constructed in 1930. Accordingly, St Elmo Court provided bedsits and two-bedroom apartments. Many of those were later converted to office space.
After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, the building was yellow stickered (meaning restricted access only). The building's owner and his insurance company agreed that it was too damaged after the 22 February 2011 earthquake for it to be saved. Demolition began on 20 March 2011.
Structural design and failure mechanism.
St Elmo Court had a light reinforced concrete frame that was infilled with masonry. Following the 4 September 2010 earthquake, diagonal shear cracks were visible in the façade in the vertical piers. One column had a shear failure. The damage became more extensive in the 22 February 2011 earthquake.
Rebuild.
A modern, 7-storey replacement is currently under construction on the Hereford Street site. The new building is being constructed to 180% of the new building code, and will feature base isolators.
Heritage listing.
On 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number being 3133.

Hacı Özbek Mosque

Hacı Özbek Mosque is a historical Ottoman mosque in Iznik, Turkey.
The Mosque.
The Hacı Özbek Mosque (1333) in Iznik, which was the first important centre of Ottoman art, is a prime example of Ottoman single-domed mosque, which illustrates a combination of Byzantine building techniques and Muslim needs. According to the inscriptive plaque (kitabe) above a window, the mosque was built by Haci Özbek bin Muhammed in the year 1333 (734 A.H.), two years after the Ottoman conquest of Iznik by the Ottoman sultan Orhan I. The building is a single-unit mosque composed of a square hall crowned with a dome, which is eight meters in diameter. The drum of the dome of the mosque is dodecagonal and adorned with a band of triangular planes on the interior. The mosque consists of a triple layer of brick with alternating layers of individually cut stone separated by vertically laid brick.
In 1959 the three-bay portico preceding the hall to the west was demolished, to make space for road expansion. The portico, was roofed with a barrel vault to the south and a mirror vault on the north. In the place of the demolished portico, a new enclosed portico was added to the northern side of the building in the year 1959. The mosque never had a minaret. The ornamental details of the interior have been lost under the layers of plaster. For the construction of the mosque, brick and rubble stone, was used, together with saw-toothed brick cornices at the top of the walls and terra-cotta tileswere used on the brick dome.

Tobacco Free Florida

Tobacco Free Florida
Mission.
Since the Tobacco Free Florida Campaign was founded in February 2008, The four main programmatic goals have been:
History.
Since 1989, Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services have been actively involved in the prevention of tobacco use. In 1997, Florida settled a large lawsuit with a large tobacco industry and was granted $11.3 billion to assist with Medicaid costs incurred by health care services for smokers. As a result of the lawsuit, the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched by the Florida Department of Health to help educate the youth on the impacts of tobacco use. When Florida's legislation decided to reduce funding to $1 million annually five years later after the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched, the 2006 ballot allowed Floridians to pass a constitutional amendment, which requires an annual appropriation of 15% of the gross 2005 tobacco settlement fund (adjusted for inflation) to provide money for a statewide tobacco education and prevention program. 
In 2007, the Zimmerman Agency, Inc. was awarded $17.1 million contract to conduct a statewide social marketing, media, and public relations campaign. The Tobacco Free Florida brand was created as the department's health communication intervention component. The Tobacco Free Florida Campaign helps thousands of Floridians quit using smoke and smokeless tobacco products through the use of TV, radio, print and social media.
Tobacco Free Florida operates on a budget of about $65 million per year. 
Campaign Overview.
The campaign started in 2008 was created to discourage the use of tobacco among all Floridians but with a specific emphasis on youth ages 11–17, adults ages 18–24, chronic disease sufferers, pregnant women, low-income households, parents and small businesses. Using English, Spanish and Haitian Creole media executions, the campaign is able to target all audiences through various communication channels. The Tobacco Free Florida and Quitline commercials have become famous through the years of their existence. Tobacco Free Florida chooses to create existing high-impact spots with "messages that elicit strong emotions response, such as personal testimonials and strong viscerally negative content." For example, a commercial that showed a brain cut in half to show the clot that has formed due to cigarette smoke. Billboards and posters are used to display images of unhealthy lungs, millions of cigarette buds collected and alarming statistics regarding tobacco use. 
Along with radio, commercial and social media Tobacco Free Florida has several ground work initiatives, including Smokifier Vans that travel the state visiting festivals, sporting events, and co-branded partners (YMCA and Walmart). The vans have age-progression software photo booths that ages visitors as smokers and nonsmokers allowing Floridians to experience the physical effects of smoking.
Sports Partnerships.
Tobacco Free Florida has successfully established partnerships with all of the following sports organizations:
Super Bowl Ads.
In 2010, Tobacco Free Florida purchased a package of ads for $447,992.50 to be run multiple times before, during and after the Super Bowl Game. The ads were created with a smoking cessation message intended to target adult smokers. A focus group was run on people who had seen the commercials and concluded that people did not care that they were at an increased risk of dying from cancer or heart disease but they did care that every year smoking leaves 31,000 children fatherless. The overall impact of the ad was to target adult smokers to think about their tobacco use affecting their children and family.

What Would the Founders Do?

What Would the Founders Do?: Our Questions, Their Answers is a 2006 non-fiction book by American journalist and historian Richard Brookhiser. The author discusses the viewpoints, backgrounds, and character traits of the American 'Founding Fathers', and he compares and contrasts those with the socio-political debates of present-day Americans. Brookhiser states, "We can be as intelligent as they were, and as serious, as practical, and as brave". The book was published by Basic Books.
Some of the issues detailed include the death penalty, gun control, censorship, assisted suicide, preemptive war, Indian casinos, campaign finance reform, and term limits.
Reviews.
The book received favorable reviews from "American Heritage", where editor Richard Snow called it "a great piece of work it" as well as "ively throughout, full of relaxed authority, and with what I really think might be the most stirring final paragraph written by an American since "The Great Gatsby"."
Forrest McDonald, historian and author of "The American Presidency" as well as "Alexander Hamilton", stated that "This is a stunning achievement. Few people know the Founders well enough and contemporary issues well enough to have put together such a book, and even fewer have Brookhiser's skill at telling the story in so fascinating a way."

Derek George Smyth

Derek Smyth is a British born scientist who specialises in peptide chemistry.
Background.
Derek Smyth was Head of the Laboratory of Peptide Chemistry at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) from 1972-1992. He had worked previously with Professor Joseph Fruton at Yale University where he gained experience in protein and peptide chemistry (1-3) and in 1960 transferred to Rockefeller University in New York City where in the laboratory of Stanford Moore and William Stein he reinvestigated and established the definitive amino acid sequence of pancreatic ribonuclease (4-9), the first enzyme to have its primary structure determined. On moving to NIMR in 1963, Derek Smyth prepared two novel derivatives of oxytocin, N-carbamylcystine-1-oxytocin and N-carbamyl cystine-1-O-carbamyltyrosine-2-oxytocin, and in a collaborative study with Gordon Bisset it was shown that while the monocarbamyl hormone retained weak biological activity (10), the dicarbamyl derivative proved to be a specific inhibitor of oxytocin devoid of intrinsic activity (11,12), demonstrating that the action of the hormone takes place in consecutive stages that could be studied independently (13). Maintaining his interest in protein structure (14-16), Derek Smyth together with Sayaki Utsumi unravelled the structure of the ‘hinge region’ of rabbit 7S gamma globulin, locating the bridge that links the two half molecules and revealing a new oligosaccharide chain (17-21). He followed this by sequencing the connecting peptide (C-peptide) of proinsulin (22-25), modelling its contribution to the 3D structure of the prohormone (25) and building on the crystallographic studies of insulin by Tom Blundell and his colleagues. The enzymatic processing of prohormones to release their biologically active constituents was a dominant lifetime interest. His major contribution came from studies of beta-lipotropin, now recognised as a component of the pro-opiomelanocortin locus. In a classic series of papers from 1975-1982, he and his collaborators* (26-34) showed that the C-terminal fragment of lipotropin, first isolated in his laboratory from pituitary (35-37), was an endogenously expressed opiate (38). They showed that this 31 amino acid peptide, now known to all as beta-endorphin, is a neurohormone with potent analgesic activity (39-43) and producing profound behavioural effects in the brain (40, 44, 45). Later, with Alan Bradbury, he elucidated the mechanism of peptide amidation, a post-translational modification essential for the activity of many peptide hormones (46-49) and more recently he and his colleagues have isolated a series of pyroglutamyl peptide amides that may play an important role in the regulation of hormone activity (50-54). After retiring from NIMR, he continued his research at the Institute for Molecular Biology in Salzburg (55, 56) and then in the Pharmacology Department of the University of Murcia, Spain (57-59). For several years (1977-1982) he assisted the Nobel Committee in their nomination of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and in 1997 he was elected as an honorary member (Excmo) of the Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery in Murcia (60).

Sign of the Kiwi

The Sign of the Kiwi, originally called Toll House, is a small café and shop at Dyers Pass on the road between Christchurch and Governors Bay. It was built in 1916/1917 by Harry Ell as a staging post and opened as a tearoom and rest house. It has a Category I heritage classification by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.
Historical context.
Harry Ell was a Member of Parliament (1899–1919) and a Christchurch City Councillor (1903 and 1917–1919). He devoted much of his life to the conservation of bush remnants on the Port Hills on Banks Peninsula, and a key element in his scheme was to make the area accessible to the public. To that end, he proposed a Summit Road that would go along the hilltops, connecting Godley Head with the tops above Akaroa. Whilst most of the public believed that the scenic reserves to be formed were too remote, Ell had a way with landowners and organised some government funding. His usual style was to pay a deposit for land, with the remainder to be raised later. In 1909, he decided to form a Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board to help with the task of establishing his dream, but there was tension over their scope. The board wanted to have influence on policy, but Ell regarded them as a mere fund-raising body. By 1915, Ell had secured 23 reserves in the Port Hills by buying private land, and none of these projects had the board's prior approval.
By the 1930s, the road had been surveyed as far south as the saddle above Pigeon Bay.
Rest houses were envisaged at regular intervals. The first to be built was the Sign of the Bellbird at Kennedy's Bush in 1914. This was the location of the first scenic reserve that Ell managed to get established in 1906. The Sign of the Packhorse, a smaller house on top of the Kaituna Saddle, was the second one to be established in 1916. The Sign of the Kiwi was the third rest house built by Ell. The Sign of the Takahe was the remaining house to be built.
History.
The Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board became aware in 1915 that Ell planned to build a toll house in Coronation Hill Reserve. The reserve was established in 1912 to commemorate the coronation of George V in the previous year. The board was opposed to this scheme, but Ell went ahead and the construction of the Toll House, as it was originally called, was started in 1916 with money borrowed from friends and sympathisers. The Sign of the Kiwi was opened on 9 June 1917. Ell's plan was that the collected toll would go towards funding the remainder of the Summit Road that had yet to be built. The toll gate was established in 1922 after the Heathcote County Council consented to its construction.
The toll gate caused considerable controversy. The dispute was over whether the toll should be compulsory. When the Main Highways Board took over the road between the Takahe and the Bellbird from the Heathcote County Council, motorists started to object. They were paying taxes for the road to be maintained, and were tolled to then use the road. The Canterbury Automobile Association lobbied on their behalf and wanted the gate totally removed. The Heathcote County Council suggested that the toll should be optional. Ell was adamant that the toll needed to be compulsory and ever using the media to his effect, he publicly declared:
I am making my will tomorrow, and am going to live in the toll house myself – and I am not coming out alive! ... I am going to move up there and take the tolls myself, until they kill me.
In October 1932, the Heathcote County Council instructed Ell to stop collecting tolls by the end of the month. The adjacent Halswell County Council came to the rescue, though. They saw the advantage of Ell collecting tolls for the maintenance of the Summit Road going through their area, and they suggested that the toll gate be relocated. Ell erected a new toll gate half a mile further south on Halswell County Council near Marley Hill and declared that a new toll lodge in Tudor style was to be built there. This did not happen, though, as Ell died in June 1934. At that time, the new toll gate was removed, too.
In 1920, Ell's wife Ada took over the running of the tea rooms in the Sign of the Kiwi. This had resulted from a conflict with the Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board. When a new chairman, businessman William Machin, took over the running of the board, he advertised in all four Christchurch newspapers that the board would not be responsible for debts incurred by Ell. Ell in turn was incensed, wrote to the Prime Minister William Massey and got the new Commissioner of Crown Lands in Christchurch to appoint him as caretaker of the Sign of the Kiwi. The board objected to this move, but Ell simply moved in. His wife taking over the running of the tea rooms saved the situation. Unlike the previous operator, she managed to make a profit every year, but suffered a nervous breakdown in 1926, which forced her to move out.
World War II caused the Sign of the Kiwi to be abandoned, and the Department of Lands and Survey closed the building in the 1940s. In 1948, ownership was transferred to Christchurch City Council, which used it as a custodian's residence. Public access was restricted to the porch. Renovation for a refreshment place started in 1989, and it was opened again, acting also as an information centre. Many recreational opportunities exist in the vicinity, and the Sign of the Kiwi is popular with locals and tourists alike.
The 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake cracked the stone plinth. It is expected that it will be repaired.
Architecture.
The Sign of the Kiwi was designed by local architect Samuel Hurst Seager, who became an international authority on the lighting of art galleries. Seager had also designed the two earlier rest houses along the Summit Road. He had a strong interest in vernacular architecture, described as a method of construction that uses locally available resources and traditions to address local needs and circumstances. The building is in the bungalow style and unlined, which gives the building strong features on the inside. The use of local stone, the careful siting, and the low construction make the building blend in well with its surroundings.
Heritage listing.
On 21 September 1989, the Sign of the Kiwi was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number being 1930. It is significant in the history of the Summit Road, and part of the earliest attempt of nature conservation in New Zealand. It is an important example of Seager's vernacular architecture. The toll gate and the stone pillar outside the building are included in the heritage listing.

Ely High School for Girls

Ely High School for Girls was a secondary school for girls which opened in 1905 at Bedford House, St.Mary's Street, Ely, Cambridgeshire. Bedford House was purchased for the school by the Isle of Ely County Council.
History.
The school opened in May 1905 with thirty girl students under the supervision of the first Headmistress, Miss E.E.Fletcher. It was recognised formally as a public secondary school by the Board of Education in 1907. The school was based in Bedford House in St. Mary's Street in Ely.
In 1957 the school was moved to a purpose built new building in Downham Road, Ely where the school operated until it was merged with Soham Grammar School Sixth Form to form the new City of Ely Sixth Form College in 1972. The new site provided for a two-form entry secondary girls' grammar school for 300 students aged 11–16 years and 60 sixth formers. Students travelled to the school from across the Isle of Ely following selection through the Eleven plus exam. Boys went to Soham Grammar School.
School Motto and Song.
Motto: Fortiter ad Fastigium (Bravely to the Top)
Song: 'O God, whose light glows in the golden sunshine'
Headteachers.
There were four Headmistresses of Ely High School.
Miss E.E. Fletcher 1905-1929
Miss E.M.Verini, M.A. 1929-1936
Miss B. Tilly, M.A., Ph.D. 1936- 1966
Miss E.Moody, B.A. 1966-1972
School houses.
In March 1928 school houses were introduced with House Mistresses in charge of each one. The four houses were Knut, Hereward, Etheldreda and Alan named after local historical figures: Canute the Great, Hereward the Wake, Aethelthryth (Saint Etheldreda) and Alan of Walsingham. House activities included sport, drama and music.
Closing the School.
Ely High School became part of Ely Community College in September 1972 and the Downham Road building became the City of Ely Sixth Form Centre. A centenary celebration was held in the Lady Chapel of Ely Cathedral on 7 May 2005.

Abuse of Power

Abuse of Power is a novel written by radio talk show host Michael Savage.
Plot.
Jack Hatfield is a hardened former war correspondent who rose to national prominence for his insightful, provocative commentary. But after being smeared as a bigot and extremist by a radical leftist media-watchdog group, he ultimately loses his job and finds himself working in obscurity as a freelance news producer in San Francisco.
One afternoon Hatfield is on a ride-along with the SFPD bomb squad when a seemingly routine carjacking turns deadly, after police find several pounds of military-grade explosives in the jacked car. And when the FBI urges Hatfield to stay out of it, he knows he’s onto something big.
This event will open up a shadowy trail that leads Hatfield from San Francisco to Tel Aviv, London, Paris, and back again, as he works with a stunning Yemeni intelligence agent and a veteran Green Beret to expose a terrorist group known as the Hand of Allah---and a plot within the highest corridors of power that will dwarf 9/11.

County administrator

In local government in the United States, a county administrator or county manager is a person appointed to be the administrative manager of a county, in a council-manager form of county government.
In some counties, the equivalent position is the county executive (although this term is sometimes used to refer to a directly- or indirectly-elected official, and not a hired employee) or county chief administrative officer (CAO) in some counties. The term "county manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of codified law, as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior such as a county commissioner.
The International City/County Management Association (ICMA) is the professional association for county administrators.
History.
The county administrator/manager, operating under the council-manager government form, was created in part to remove county government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the county into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the hope that the county manager would remain neutral to county politics.
Responsibilities.
As the top appointed official in the county, the county administrator/manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the county, in addition to other expectations.
Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a county administrator/manager include:
The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations.
Profile.
Today the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning county manager is a Master of Public Administration (MPA) or other master's degree in public administration and at least several years’ experience as a department head in local government or as an assistant county manager. The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years and has risen gradually over the years. Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well depending on the region of the country.

Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service

The Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service is an award of the United States Department of State. It is presented to employees of State, USAID, and civilian contractors assigned to diplomatic and consular facilities for events that lead to death or serious illness or injury. It is roughly comparable to the U.S. military's Purple Heart, but since the criteria for the award is so strict, nearly all of them are awarded posthumously.
The award consists of a gold medal set and a certificate signed by the Secretary of State and the President of the United States.
The initial regulations limited the issuance of the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service, originally known as the Foreign Service Star, only to members of the U.S. Foreign Service personnel system who were killed or seriously injured. The rules were later changed to allow for members of other personnel systems killed while working on behalf of a foreign affairs agency.
There had been considerable controversy about the name of the award, which suggested that only diplomats serving under the Foreign Service personnel system were eligible. As a result, Secretary of State Colin Powell proposed changing the name of the award from the Foreign Service Star to simply the Thomas Jefferson Star. The American Foreign Service Association and the Foreign Affairs Council resisted the proposal while many others strongly supported it. In the end, the words "Foreign Service" were maintained as part of the name.
Eligibility.
Any civilian employee of any agency, including Foreign Service Nationals (appointed under Section 303 of the Foreign Service Act), non-family member U.S. citizen employees hired at post (appointed under Section 303 and appointed under Section 311 (a) of the Foreign Service Act), and U.S. citizens and foreign nationals serving under a Personal Services Contract or Personal Services Agreement (if eligibility for the award is authorized in their contracts), are eligible for the Foreign Service Star Award as long as the employee is:

The Secretary shall make final recommendations to the President.
Effective Date.
The effective date for the "Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service" shall be August 7, 1998.
An employee or surviving next of kin may petition the Department Awards Committee to consider individuals who are eligible and deserving of the Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service notwithstanding the fact that the illness, injury or death occurred prior to the effective date.

Ifor Pritchard

Ifor Pritchard (1940 - 9 October 2010) was an artist and former art teacher predominantly at Ysgol Sir Huw Owen, Caernarfon in North Wales, retiring in 1992.
His paintings mostly drew on his childhood in the North Wales village of Carmel, Gwynedd and his memories of the local slate quarries. 
Working with oil and using an impasto technique, he built up the surface of his canvases with thick blocks of solid colour, creating bold and dynamic portraits of remembered and imagined figures of the slate industry. He predominantly utilised a limited palette with a preference for blues, greys and purples, although exceptions include the quarrymen's brass band, their outfits rendered in bright reds and vibrant oranges.
Pritchard first exhibited his slate-inspired work at an exhibition at Glynllifon, near Caernarfon in 2007 exhibiting 30 original works. At his peak he exhibited 60 pieces in June 2009 at the Oriel Ynys Mon, Anglesey. 
Pritchard died aged 70 in Porthmadog following a short illness.
A book titled 'Craig yr Oesoedd / True Grit' was posthumously published in October 2011 by Carreg Gwalch cataloging in 80 pages some of his best work.

Seven years of regular training daily with qualified instructors m.w pickering focused his attention; and main topic of training via lau gar kung fu. This particular system provided a clear understanding of method and application. Not by system but, by those that tsught. The manufacture of the stag character was obtained with the long term affiliation with S. Clark, R. Dokic, J. Shaw, C. Thompson and D. Sullavon all to whom applied their take on teaching and training. Influential as they were the result continues and construction of the art reflects M. Pickering's application of combat. The stag character is accompanied by FIVE other animals making the family tree of Fu Gung Gar; that a whole. Crane, tiger, eagle, leopard and Rooster as a unity. All have been chosen to complement the house of Fu Gung Gar. The traits of the stag as like other animal are as follows, explosive power, direct attack in most cases i.e. sudden, rush attacks and upper body strength propelled by lower strength in the legs, as a combined force; provides the practitioner with the desired effect and mobility to attack on defence. Lower leg strikes, stamps, traps, close quarter locks, head butts, shoulder barges and the use of forearms and elbows, systematically assist a practical way of defence by attack by proxy.

Six years later he played for Rangoon Gymkhana in their only first-class match, which came against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In this match he took a single wicket, that of John Parsons in the MCC first-innings. With the bat he scored 5 runs in the Gymkhana's first-innings, before being dismissed by Jack Mercer, while in their second-innings he scored 11 runs before being dismissed by Maurice Tate. Two days after the conclusion of that match, McCarthy made his final first-class appearance for Burma against the MCC. He scored top scored in their first-innings with 48.

<doc id="31242635" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31242635" title="Translation of Han dynasty titles">
Translation of Han dynasty titles

The translation of Han dynasty government titles into English varies within the academic community. This page is a reference to compare renderings of Chinese official titles by different sinologists.
History.
The first specialist reference about the English renderings of Chinese official titles was written in 1878 by a British legate to the Chinese government in Beijing, William Frederick Mayers. The most common terms used today in translation of official titles date back to Homer H. Dubs's translation of the "Book of Han" and "Book of the Later Han" from 1938 to 1955.
Dubs's translation lacked a published glossary of titles, but a list of titles used by Dubs was compiled by Rafe de Crespigny and published in 1967. In the interim, Wang Yuquan (王毓銓) published "An Outline of the Central Government of the Former Han Dynasty" in 1949. The next major systematising work on Han dynasty government was "The Bureaucracy of Han Times" written by Hans Bielenstein in 1980, drawing upon Dubs's and de Crespigny's work as its major source of translation for titles.
In 1985, Charles Hucker completed his "Dictionary of Official Titles of Imperial China", a collection of nearly 8,300 titles and government offices and associated translations for every dynasty from the Zhou to the Qing, the most complete specialist literature of its type. During the 1980s and 1990s another list of proposed translation for Han dynasty titles was circulating in the University of Washington, where Jack Dull headed the Han Dynasty Project. Long after Dull's death, this list was made available as part of his collection of unpublished papers, available online from University of Oregon. Dull's list of "Official Titles of the Han Dynasty" also mainly follows Dubs.
Two comperehensive biographical dictionaries have also added to these reference aids: Michael Loewe's 2000 "Biographical Dictionary of Qin, Former Han, and Xin Periods", and Rafe de Crespigny's 2007 "Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms", both published by Brill and intended to complement each other. De Crespigny's translation of titles mainly follow Dubs with some alterations, whereas Loewe's tend to be his own original renderings.
In 2007 Rafe de Crespigny published online a collection of his papers, among them "An Outline of the Military Organisation of the Later Han Empire" and "An Outline of the Civil Administration of the Later Han Empire". Each of these includes an appendix listing a number of titles along with the translation de Crespigny has adopted, which he calls "slightly modified, varying from the system established by H.H. Dubs...".
Schema for Han dynasty titles.
The Dubs school.
The Dubs school of title translation has the longest pedigree of any schema for title translation and has broad acceptance in the scholarly community, but it was not built on any unifying principles and changed erratically during Dubs's lifetime. It is now mainly represented by the works of Bielenstein, de Crespigny, and Dull, all of whom made their own minor alterations while trying to remain mostly in the Dubs framework.
Wang Yuquan's 1949 article, although based entirely on primary source materials, seems to draw inspiration for translation of titles from Dubs in places, and can be considered to be completely superseded by later works. It was a source for Bielenstein, who called it "out of date". Bielenstein remains the academic standard which all others attempt to improve but compare themselves against for context. Dull's work, unpublished until it was released freely on the web in 2010, has been ignored by academia. De Crespigny has gone further outside the Dubs mold than the other authors.
In a 1971 review of de Crespigny's 1969 translation of part of the "Zizhi Tongjian", Han dynasty specialist Anthony Hulsewé impugned the renderings of Chinese official titles, which then much more closely followed Dubs, as "barbarized" and "abhorrent".
The Hucker system.
Hucker's system has, in the main, not been adopted by the scholarly community. Its strengths are that it was created with a goal of systematisation and universality, and built upon sounds principles of translation: that the rendering should ideally convey both the sense of the responsibilities of the office and the literal Chinese meaning, that it should avoid too-familiar Western analogues likely to create false impressions, and that is should not rely on bizarre-sounding neologisms. Hucker drew from a great deal of references during his research, including the work of Bielenstein, and received input from a large number of Chinese scholars, including de Crespigny and Dull.
In "An Outline of the Civil Administration of the Later Han Empire", Rafe de Crespigny rejects outright Hucker's system, claiming he found Hucker's renderings to be unreliable and unacceptable for the Han period.
Loewe.
The titles adopted by Loewe in his "Biographical Dictionary" largely follow the translations as they appeared in "The Cambridge History of China", volume 1 (1987), which Loewe helped to edit. He shies away from more literal translations, opting instead for renderings which "indicate an official's responsibilities, or his place in the organs of government, where possible in immediately meaningful terms; and in so far as imperial offices were organised in a hierarchical basis, it has been thought advisable to choose terms which convey an official's degree of seniority." Loewe appends a table comparing the renderings he adopts to those used by "Dubs, Bielenstein, and de Crespigny", acknowledging their grouping as a single school and that school's sinological primacy.
Difficulties.
Several difficulties exist in providing a unified one-to-one translation for Han dynasty titles, these may range from each scholar's personal preferences to more profound issues.
One main point of contention is whether the translation should follow the literal meaning of the title or to describe the roles of that title's holder. As the Chinese bureaucracy developed, the responsibilities of an office changed and the names of positions changed, not necessarily at the same time. An office from the Zhou dynasty might share the same title as an office from the Qing dynasty, but with completely different powers, scope, and responsibilities.
Not every scholar covers every era. While Hucker's system is meant to detail government offices since the Zhou dynasty, the Dubs School focuses on the Han dynasty, and to a lesser extent the Qin dynasty and Three Kingdoms period. De Crespigny is an expert on the Later Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms; Loewe is an expert on the Former Han and Xin dynasties. A valid translation for one dynasty may not be valid for another.
Comparisons.
Here's a brief table of comparisons between Han dynasty Chinese official titles and the five most complete sources of renderings, ordered by pinyin.

History.
The Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral was established in 1905. The first services were held on the second floor of a sporting goods store. Once the membership of the church started to grow, the church relocated a couple of times. Former locations include: A Presbyterian Church (1906–1928) and a former Jewish Temple (1928–1967). Since 1968, the cathedral has been located at 2500 Clairmont Road. The current building is a giant domed cathedral with a large community center adjacent to the church, which was dedicated in 2002.
Architecture.
The church was built in a typical Byzantine style. The shape of the church is round, with a giant domed roof. Inside the church, glittering mosaics decorate the walls. A noteworthy feature of the church is the mosaic on the dome. It shows Jesus Christ as the Pantocrator. There are also mosaics on the iconostasis. In addition to the mosaics, the church also has some stained glass windows above the iconostasis. The stained glass windows show Jesus Christ surrounded by the twelve disciples. Each disciple gets his own small circular window, with the window showing Jesus being directly above the altar. The window with Jesus is slightly bigger than the other windows.

Still Life with Straw Hat

"Still Life with Straw Hat ("Stillleben mit gelbem Strohhut")" also known as "Still Life with Yellow Straw Hat" and "Still Life with Hat and Pipe" was painted by Vincent van Gogh in late November - mid-December 1881 or possibly in 1885 in the town of Nuenen.
Van Gogh in Nuenen.
In November 1884 Van Gogh taught some friends from Eindhoven, a large town near Nuenen, to paint inanimate objects in oil. Van Gogh, in his enthusiasm, created a series of still life paintings of bottles, bowls and pots and other objects. "Still Life with Straw Hat" was painted at Nuenen during this period. He wrote that the paintings would be hard to sell, but having deemed the effort valuable he painted still life compositions throughout the winter.
The painting.
"Still-Life with Straw Hat" and another painting of this period, "Still-life with Earthen Pot and Clogs," are regarded by critics and writers for their technical mastery. Both are characterized by smooth, meticulous brushwork and fine shading of colors. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolors and nearly 200 oil paintings. However, his palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and he showed no sign of developing the vivid coloration that distinguishes his later, best known work. When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, Theo replied that they were too dark and not in line with the current style of bright Impressionist paintings.
The painting is part of the Kröller-Müller Museum collection in Otterlo, Netherlands
Provenance.
Helene, wife of Anton Kröller, spent her life and fortune collecting Van Gogh paintings. The Kröller's art collection of the 19th and 20th century went to the Dutch state and the Kröller-Müller Museum. It may be that the arrangement was more a means of restitution for the millions of guilders paid by the Dutch state in the 1930s to maintain solvency a bank, one of Anton Kröller corporation's largest clients, and in the process shield Kröller.

GAIN – Global Appraisal of Individual Needs

The Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) is a family of evidence-based instruments used to assist clinicians with diagnosis, placement, and treatment planning. The GAIN is used with both adolescents and adults in all kinds of treatment programs, including outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, methadone, short-term residential, long-term residential, therapeutic community, and correctional programs.
History.
The GAIN was developed to respond to the needs of substance abuse treatment personnel who are faced with the demands of assessing, documenting, treating, and monitoring clients. Researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and behavioral healthcare agencies worked to design assessment tools that could produce methodical data for mapping onto the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) for diagnosis and the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria for placement, while following The Joint Commission (TJC) the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) for integrating assessments into treatment plans. Since its inception in 1993, application of the GAIN has expanded to thousands of users at agencies across the United States, Canada and several other countries.
Family of Assessments.
All these assessments can be used to generate reports to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning.
Content.
The GAIN-I has sections covering background, substance use, physical health, risk behaviors and disease prevention, mental and emotional health, environment and living situation, legal, and vocational. Within these sections are questions that address problems, services, client attitudes and beliefs, and the client's desire for services. Information on symptoms, which is used for diagnosis, is collected if the behavior has occurred in the last year. Information on behaviors, which is used for treatment monitoring, is collected if the same behavior occurred within the last 90 days. The items are combined into over 100 scales Scale (social sciences) and subscales that can be used for DSM-IV–based diagnoses, ASAM-based level-of-care placement, TJC-based treatment planning, and Drug Outcome Monitoring Study-based outcome monitoring. The GAIN also includes items that support most state and federal reporting requirements, which compare to community samples from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH [formerly the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA)). As biopsychosocial assessments, The GAIN-I and GAIN-SS provide measures over four main categories of emotional and behavioral health problems—internalizing, externalizing, substance, and crime/violence. Among these categories are numerous scales and indices, which have demonstrated good reliability and internal consistency in studies.
Response to Criticism.
The GAIN has been criticized for not having scales to assess response style. Critics say these face-valid questions are vulnerable to faked responses from participants. Although it would be impossible for interviewers to ensure that participants always provide genuine responses to questions, the benefit of semi-structured assessments, like the GAIN, is that they allow the interviewer to clarify participant responses. Additionally, helping participants understand how their responses will be used in specific areas of their treatment may encourage them to be truthful. The GAIN-I includes ratings at the end of each section that allow an interviewer to record whether a participant seemed to be doing some estimating, whether they did not understand the questions, whether they were in denial about the severity of a problem or whether they were misrepresenting information. These ratings can be used as flags to communicate problem areas to clinicians and can also assist in treatment planning.

Cairnryan Harbour

During World War II, Cairnryan became No.2 Military Port, and three harbour piers and a military railway linking the village with nearby Stranraer were built by the army. Only one of the piers still remains, one was dismantled and another was destroyed in an ammunition explosion shortly after the war. The remaining pier is now in a state of disrepair and is fenced off to the public. However many anglers still take their chances and use the pier as its offers rich pickings for a variety of seafish such as mackerel, cod, dogfish, mullet and plaice.
Thousands of troops were based locally in military camps. At the end of the war, the Atlantic U-Boat fleet surrendered in Loch Ryan and was anchored in the port before being towed to the North Channel and scuttled. This activity was codenamed Operation Deadlight.
For a period after the war, the port was used to load superfluous ammunition onto army landing craft for disposal at sea - a hazardous task, which took the lives of several at the port, while the long-term and wider risks of such dumping have only later become more evident. It ceased in the early 1960s when most of the military infrastructure was abandoned, then dismantled, apart from one of the military jetties which remains, albeit in a perilous state.
Ship breaking then became the main industry; the great British aircraft carriers HMS "Centaur", HMS "Bulwark", HMS "Eagle", and HMS "Ark Royal" were all sent here for decommissioning, as well as a number of other vessels including HMS "Mohawk" and HMS "Blake". As recently as 1990, Soviet Navy submarines were being dismantled here for scrap.
Cairnryan Harbour was built along with Faslane naval base on the Gare Loch, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.
Rail Connections.
The nearest station is Stranraer with a bus connection from the port connecting with trains to Glasgow Central.
In September 2013 a bus link, route 350 operated by McLeans, was introduced between the P&O Ferries and Stena Line ferry terminals at Cairnryan and Stranraer railway station. The bus route also serves the centre of Stranraer. Stranraer railway station is served by trains run by First ScotRail to Ayr and Glasgow Central.

Bob Spicer

Robert Oberton Spicer (born April 11, 1925, at Richmond, Virginia) is a retired American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher and occasional outfielder, he had a highly successful 15-season minor league career (1947–1961) but played only four games as a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for the – Kansas City Athletics. He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .
Spicer's career began in the Chicago Cubs' farm system with 16-, 21- and 20-victory seasons from 1947–1949 in levels ranging from Class D (the lowest rung then on the minor league ladder) to Class AA. In 1949, he helped lead the Macon Peaches to the Class A Sally League championship, tying for the league lead in wins with 20, and was selected to the all-star team. He spent four full seasons with the Los Angeles Angels of the top-level Pacific Coast League before the Athletics, newly transplanted from Philadelphia, selected him in the 1954 Rule 5 draft. He was part of the first Major League team to represent Kansas City. 
In his first game, April 17, 1955, at Briggs Stadium, he entered the game in the fifth inning with the Detroit Tigers already leading the Athletics, 6–0. Spicer surrendered one run in the fifth, but was unable to record an out in the sixth frame, giving up a leadoff home run to Al Kaline, a future Hall of Famer, and leaving the bases loaded. All would score in an eventual 16–0 Tiger win. Spicer appeared in one more game for Kansas City that season, on April 23 at home against the Chicago White Sox at Municipal Stadium. Again he was treated roughly, surrendering two more home runs (to Minnie Miñoso and Jack Harshman) and five more earned runs in 1⅔ innings in a 29–6 rout. It was his last MLB appearance of 1955.
After a successful 1956 campaign with the Triple-A Columbus Jets, Spicer returned to the Athletics for a second trial after the rosters expanded in September. In his first outing, September 18, he pitched a scoreless third of an inning in a 6–5 triumph over the Boston Red Sox in Kansas City. But four days later, in what would be his final MLB game, facing the White Sox at Comiskey Park, Spicer was roughed up again for five earned runs in another one-sided Chicago win, 17–3. All told, he gave up 15 hits and 15 earned runs in five innings of work, with two strikeouts and five bases on balls.
But he resumed his minor league career in 1957, eventually winning 166 games through 1961. A good-hitting pitcher, he spent some time in the outfield between pitching assignments, and batted .244 lifetime.

Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris

The Church Notre-Dame-de-Lorette is a neoclassical church in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. 
History.
Construction of the church began in 1823 under the reign of Louis XVIII and was completed in 1836 under the reign of Louis-Philippe.
An earlier chapel of the same name was situated at 54 rue Lamartine but was destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1821, plans were made to rebuild Norte-Dame-de-Lorette, with Louis-Hippolyte Lebas the sole architect. Originally, the church was planned to face northward towards Montmartre, but eventually faced southward towards rue Laffitte. 
Two notable figures in French culture were baptized at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. Musician Georges Bizet received his baptism at the church on March 16, 1840, while painter Claude Monet was baptized on May 20, 1841.
Building details.
The early 19th century was characterized with neoclassical building styles, with the church also being designed in this manner. Instead of decorative paintings being placed on the church's walls, murals were painted directly onto them, similarly to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The façade features Charles-François Lebœuf's sculpture "Six angels in adoration before the Madonna and Child". Inside are the statues of Charles-René Laitié, Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire and Denis Foyatier, who represent the three theological virtues of charity, hope and faith, respectively. 
France's motto "Liberté, égalité, fraternité" (Liberty, equality, fraternity) was added above the church's main entrance in 1902.

Regula Tschumi

Regula Tschumi is a Swiss social anthropologist and art historian.
Bibliography.
Regula Tschumi has spent time in East, West and South Africa, researching into contemporary African art. In 2006 she published a standard work on the figurative coffins of the Ga people. In this book she traces the origins of these coffins in the art and religion of the Ga, and questions the history of their evolution. In the course of this research Regula Tschumi discovered the coffin-artist and art brut painter Ataa Oko, born 1919, from La, in Ghana. Ataa Oko was making figurative coffins as long ago as 1945, that is to say, according to her, before Kane Kwei, who was generally recognised outside Ghana as having "invented" these coffins for the burial rituals of the Ga. In her PhD thesis 2013 Regula Tschumi makes the first deep research about the formerly unknown figurative palanquins of the Ga. She shows how the figurative palanquins are related with the figurative coffins, and why the figurative palanquins were used in Accra as early as 1930. She discovered that differently from what many Ga believe, no chief has ever been buried in his figurative palanquin. Palanquins belong to the powerful royal insignias which in the Ga culture may never be buried. Therefore kings were not buried in their palanquin, but in a coffin that looked the same like their palanquin. This was necessary because the Ga believe that enstoolments and funerals are complementary.
Regula Tschumi has taken part in various exhibition projects in leading museums, when she worked with different Ghanaian artists and coffin-palanquin-makers like Paa Joe, Ataa Oko and Kudjoe Affutu among others.

B-cycle is a public bicycle sharing company formed in partnership between Trek Bicycle Corporation, Humana, and Crispin Porter + Bogusky and is based in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. B-cycle launched the first large-scale smart-technology bicycle sharing system in the United States in Denver, Colorado on Earth Day, April 22, 2010 with 500 bikes. B-cycle now has systems operating in more than 25 cities including Denver, Boulder, Madison, San Antonio, Fort Worth, Houston, Salt Lake City, UT, Charlotte, NC, Nashville and Broward County. Annual Memberships are recognized in most B-cycle cities in a reciprocity program called "B-connected."
The B-cycle system is flexible and technologically advanced so that communities can implement bike sharing into existing infrastructure and transportation networks with ease. Its facilities include bicycles and solar-powered stations positioned throughout a city or region. Users purchase day passes or annual memberships and can check out and return bikes at any station in their city. The purpose of the system is to provide a flexible method for completing short trips rather than using an automobile or traditional longer rentals or bike rental companies.
Locations around the country.
As of April 2014, B-cycle has bicycle sharing systems in the following areas:
Company History.
In 2007, the founding partners of B-cycle, Trek Bicycle Corporation and Humana,began their bike sharing venture with the nation’s largest ever temporary bike sharing program culminating at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.  Called Freewheelin, this program made 1,000 bikes available to the delegates at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. The programs proved so successful that the Democratic host committee selected bike sharing as a special legacy program to receive a donation to launch the country’s first smart bike sharing system.  Following the Democratic National Convention, Trek Bicycle Corporation, Humana and advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky formed B-cycle, LLC. to develop a technologically and visually appealing bike share system. The joint venture worked with the non-profit created to operate the system, Denver Bike Sharing, to launch the initial 500 bike and 40 station Denver B-cycle in Denver on Earth Day, April 22, 2010.

The film was a quota quickie, produced at Elstree Studios for Paramount to help them meet their yearly quota set down by the British government. Today the film is best known for marking the debut of Vivien Leigh.

George Pocheptsov

George Oleg Pocheptsov VII (born 29 January 1992) is an American painter, draughtsman and entrepreneur.
Life and career.
Early life.
George Pocheptsov, who is sometimes also referred to as "Georgie", was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1992 to Ukrainian parents. When Pocheptsov was eleven months old, his father became ill with brain cancer. He died in 1995 at the age of forty. Though he was a toddler, his mother gave him a pencil and some paper to keep him busy. At seventeen months old, he drew a replica of an antique car parked across the street. At a young age, Pocheptsov was drawing jesters, pregnant women, and four-headed giraffes, all in bright color schemes. He started to paint six months before he started to talk.
Pocheptsov attended Wrightsville Beach Elementary School in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Abstract and Impressionistic Period (Ages 6-15).
Pocheptsov is completely self-taught in the arts.
Pocheptsov is often compared by the press to a young Pablo Picasso or Marc Chagall, particularly for his vivid color palette and early rise to fame. His paintings can sell upward of $200,000.
Three-dimensional Canvas and Impressionism (Ages 16-Current).
Starting around the age of 16, George started to focus more on three-dimensional canvas and impressionistic art. The 3D canvas is effectively making a sculpture on canvas. George creates this effect by taking a regular piece of stretched canvas and putting layers of unstretched canvas over it, and then sculpts figures on that layer. At that point, he paints the figures with multiple layers of gesso (a primer), and once they dry, he paints the details onto the sculpture. For more detailed aspects of the Sculpture, such as nose, eyelashes, fingers, etc., on a figure, he uses modeling paste. In the end, each figure in the piece has three sides, each painted, making a truly three-dimensional impressionistic piece of art.
Collections and Acquisitions.
In recent years, Pocheptsov has been commissioned to create paintings for Colin Powell, Hillary Clinton, Celine Dion, Alain Ducasse, Michael Jordan, among other famous collectors. He was commissioned to create "sculptured canvas," a self-defined technique, for the Mitchell Camera Museum in London and for the United Nations' 60th anniversary exhibition.
Pocheptsov was also invited to Geneva, Switzerland for a book titled “The Arts and Copyright” in which he was featured as an artistic figure.
Internationally, Pocheptsov has been featured in museums and galleries in England, France, Korea, South Africa, the Netherlands, Russia, Japan, and the Ukraine.
Appearance in Popular Culture.
The media and prominent art collectors refer to Pocheptsov as a child prodigy, especially in the earlier part of his life. Pocheptsov art career appears in magazines and newspapers such as "The New York Times", "Time", "People", "Parents", "The Washingtonian", "US Art", "Art and Antiques", "Art News", "Architectural Digest", "Southern Living", "Spirit of the Carolinas", among other publications. He has also has made appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show", "Good Morning America", "The John Walsh Show", "The Today Show", "Ripley’s Believe It or Not", "The Later Today Show", and Nickelodeon.
A documentary film detailing Pocheptsov’s life titled, “A Brush with Destiny,” won four Emmy Awards.
Philanthropy and Charitable Work.
The George Pocheptsov Foundation.
Pocheptsov has used his art career to fund charitable contributions to several charities. In many cases, Pocheptsov donates artwork to a charitable organization, and this artwork is subsequently auctioned at a gala or fundraiser to benefit the charity. To date, Pocheptsov’s charitable foundation has donated over $8 million through the auctioning of his artwork.
Personal life.
Pocheptsov speaks fluent Russian, Ukrainian, French, and English. He is also proficient in Latin.
Education.
George is currently a student at Harvard University and is planning to graduate in the class of 2014.

Everlasting (Natalie Cole album)

Everlasting is a 1987 album by Natalie Cole. She returned to Capitol Records via Manhattan Records. This album is considered her commercial comeback.
It was, by far, one of Natalie's most diverse set from the hot dance opus from the hot producing duo of the time, The Calloways, contributing, "Jump Start", the Top 3 R&B and Pop Top 10. The pure pop crossover cover of Bruce Springsteen's "Pink Cadillac" also hit the Hot 100 Top 10 and the pop/adult contemporary hit, "I Live For Your Love". These great singles were augmented by equally strong album cuts from as diverse a contributor to the above listed, Bacharach/David, "In My Reality" and "Split Decision" along with another great cover of "When I Fall in Love" bringing her another step closer to tapping into her father's era of the Great American Songbook.
The album that many had longed for was just around the bend as this comeback of sorts, set the stage, and her career would never quite be the same.

Eriogonum pelinophilum

Eriogonum pelinophilum is a rare species of wild buckwheat known by the common name clay-loving wild buckwheat. It is endemic to the state of Colorado in the United States, where it is known from only two counties. The most recent estimates available suggest there are 12 occurrences in existence for a total of about 278,000 individual plants in Delta and Montrose Counties. At least 7 occurrences observed in the past have not been relocated but are not yet believed extirpated. This plant is federally listed as an endangered species of the United States.
This plant was first collected in 1958 but proved difficult to relocate in the wild. When it was finally found, "Eriogonum" expert James L. Reveal examined it in the field, compared it to the similar buckwheat "Eriogonum contortum", and named it as a new species in 1973. Recent genetic analysis confirms that these two species and "Eriogonum clavellatum" are indeed similar but are 3 distinct species. 
The clay-loving wild buckwheat is known only from the adobe clay hills and flats near Delta and Montrose, Colorado. All the occurrences can be found within an area of land 28.5 miles long by 11.5 miles wide. The substrate is pale whitish clay with an alkaline pH that originated from Cretaceous marine sediment. This is not generally a soil type that is hospitable to most plant life; it is very fine-grained, dense, compacted, rich in calcium carbonate, and prone to shrinking and swelling. The soil does not retain water, the pH is high, it is not easy for roots to penetrate, and there is little oxygen. The clay-loving wild buckwheat grows in areas where some moisture is retained, such as swales, where snow persists a bit longer. The habitat supports a few other plants that tolerate the landscape, including mat saltbrush ("Atriplex corrugata") and black sagebrush ("Artemisia nova"), and another adobe-adapted local endemic, the Adobe Hills beardtongue ("Penstemon retrorsa"). In most areas, the clay-loving buckwheat is the dominant species. 
This is a subshrub with branches spreading wider than they grow tall, the plant reaching perhaps 12 centimeters tall by 40 wide. The woody stem bases emerge from a big taproot, and as they age the bark comes off in strips or plates. The upper branches are hairless or tufted with bits of hair. There are solitary leaves widely spaced on the branches. They are lance-shaped, no more than 1.5 centimeters long, and hairy on the undersides. The inflorescence is a small, dense cyme of flowers 2 or 3 centimeters long and packed with tiny whitish or cream-colored flowers. The flowers are pollinated by ants, of which 18 species have been observed on the plants.
This plant has a limited distribution and is found only on a specific substrate. 75% of its habitat is on privately owned land with little protection. Its limited range is threatened by a number of forces. Nearby towns have experienced rapid growth, which has led to an expansion of residential areas with construction of houses, power lines and other utilities, and roads. The area lies within the Uncompahgre River Valley, which hosts agricultural operations fed by a number of canals and ditches. These have access roads. The construction and maintenance of the canals and roads create disturbance in the habitat and help introduce invasive plants to the area. Sediment scooped from the canals is dumped in the plant's habitat. About 40% of the plant's total habitat is affected by these activities. Off-road vehicle use damages the landscape by compacting and eroding soil, creating dust, fragmenting the habitat, and crushing individual plants. The adobe clay substrate is easily broken and eroded because it is bare and contains few plant roots to hold it together. ORV use is currently prohibited in much of the plant's habitat, but if federal protection was removed the threat would be greater.

Harle Syke

Harle Syke is a small village within the parish of Briercliffe, situated three miles north of Burnley, Lancashire, England. It was the home to eleven weaving firms, working out of seven mills. Queen Street Mill closed in 1982, and was converted to a textile museum, preserving it as a working mill. It is the world's last 19th century steam powered weaving mill.
Location.
Harle Syke lies at the edge of the Burnley urban area connecting it to the village of Haggate. The main road climbs from the Burnley border to the small crossroads in Haggate, with a road between Nelson and Todmorden. The village dates from the late 19th century, when most of the weaving mills were built. The origins of the name Harle Syke, first used for a farm nearby are descriptive, Harle is a persons name, while sike or syke is a local word meaning ditch. The village itself is relatively flat rising to 800 feet above sea level. To the south is the valley of the River Don or Thursden Brook and to the north is hill of Marsden Height, () in Brierfield. The buildings in the village are predominantly stone-built.
As of 2011, Harle Syke has no public houses although it has a social club (Briercliffe Social Club). There is a Church of England church.
Harle syke has direct road links with Burnley and Nelson, and is served by local bus services (4,5) operated by Transdev Burnley & Pendle.
History.
Briercliffe was named in the Charter of Freewarren granted to Edmund de Lacy the Lord of Blackburnshire in 1251, allowing him to use the area for hunting hares, rabbits and foxes.
In the 18th century, the people of the area worked mostly as farmers and were major producers of wool. There was also a coal mine (which remained open until the middle of the 20th century), that supplied coal to the rapidly growing cotton mills in Burnley. In 1850, a group of men from Haggate founded the first cotton mill in Briercliffe, Harle Syke Mill. They chose a site on farmland next to the road to Burnley, near a natural spring and constructed workers housing close by.
The success of Harle Syke Mill (today known as 'Oxford Mill'), which operated as a Room and power mill, renting out the space and power from line shafts to manufacturing companies, led to further construction. The new village of Harle Syke expanded steadily until World War I. Harle Syke became the base of many Burnley cotton firms during the time when Lancashire was the cotton capital of the world.
Then, Harle Syke children would go to Haggate School, originally a sunday school for the Baptist Church, was built on the site of the Haggate cricket pitch in 1882. Most at 12 would become part-timers at one of the mills, or stay on until 13. The school later became the village primary school, and was more recently used by Burnley College.
The mills.
In a sense the village was built up around the cotton weaving sheds, or mills as they were also known. The word mill can refer to the building, or to one of the manufacturing companies that rents space in such a mill. For example, Haggate Weaving Company, shared the other half of a mill with Altham's of Heasandford Mill, Burnley. There, the buildings and engine were owned by a "room and power" company called Briercliffe Mill. Because of the availability of room and power, the Harle Syke sheds gave birth to many small companies who grew to build their own reputations and mills in the village, or Burnley and beyond.
The first steam driven power loom shed in Briercliffe was a 400 loom shed at Lane Bottom set up by William Smith of Hill End in 1848, near his existing hand loom factory, the 1777 Hill Factory. The Extwistle Mill, at Extwistle was a small water powered mill with 100 looms, that eventually converted to steam. In spite of the 1826-1848 crisis, handloom weavers were still having work put out to them from outside the district, but the community was suffering extreme poverty. Smith's Mill, or Lane End Mill took on both young women and young men, their parents sticking to Hand Loom Weaving. The 200 paid jobs it provided set new expectation of income for teenagers in the district. 
Harle Syke Shed, the next mill to open in 1858 has an interesting history, not so much for the architecture but the means it was financed over the 150 years of its existence. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company was a collaborative venture set up under Sir Robert Peel's Joint Stock Companies Act of 1844, 64 wage-earning men and women signed the deed of settlement and agreed to take up one £10 share paying a one shilling deposit. Two thirds of them were weavers. Though co-operative in name, the company structure was structured to make profit, and the companies like this that did make it through the downturn of 1857, and the severe recession caused by the Cotton Famine of 1862-63, were more severe employers than the private family businesses. Shares were traded, and dividend paid, and the shareholders often contributed unpaid work to keep the business as well as having unlimited liability for the companies debts. In effect they were running two businesses, protecting the capital assets that is the buildings, boilers and engine and then manufacturing and trading in cotton cloth. The five elected directors, had a great deal of discretion on how and how long the business should operate.
In 1865, the company was reorganised. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company became solely a "room and power" company The looms were disposed of to the share holders, each receiving a pro-rata allocation. Between 1865, the property company appears to have achieved steady growth and was expanded in the 1860s and 1880s. The producer partnerships that were formed when the looms were allocated consolidated and shares in the room and power 'walls' company were traded resulting in a smaller number of shareholders with larger investments. There were seven 'producer partnerships' in 1865.
Briercliffe Mill was a direct imitation of the reconstituted Harle Syke Mill. It was a pure room and power mill built in 1880 directly opposite it. It was occupied by two firms: Abraham Altham and the Haggate Weaving Company. The Briercliffe Mill Company and the Haggate Weaving Company were both taken over by Taylor & Hartley of Westhoughton and the company closed in 1960. 
The Queen Street Manufacturing Company was a later direct imitation of the 'Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company'. It took advantage of favourable trading conditions in 1894 to finance itself with 4000, £5.00 shares sold mainly to locals. It built and then extended Queen Street Mill having 1135 Burnley looms. At times it also rented space at the adjoining Primrose Mill- bringing its loomage up to 1500.
There was a lot of activity in 1903-1905. The Haggate Joint Stock Commercial Company went in to liquidation on 28 February 1903 with the assets passing to the Harle Syke Mill Company. The Haggate £10 shares were valued at £25, and the 53 shareholders in the old company were paid in shares in the new company. The Directors were the same. This was used as an opportunity to expand. A new larger engine was purchased, and a large new weaving shed designed by Joseph Keithley was built. The new company a property company and a production company. The new shed accommodated 900 looms. Additional funding was found by issuing promissory notes at a rate of 4%. A mortgage for £12000 was obtained from the Burnley Building Society.
Walshaw Mill was incorporated 5 January 1905. It was financed with 12000, £1 shares and recapitalised later with an additional 30000. It started with 586 looms which was later increased to nearly 1100.
Alongside Queen Street Mill were two other thousand loom sheds. Primrose Mill was built in 1906 by the West family so was not a joint stock company, and neither was the King's Mill.
Of the mills, Harle Syke Mill now called Oxford mill, and Siberia Mill is rebuilt as industrial units and there are plans for some housing. Briercliffe mill is in use by various firms including for document storage, and similarly with Walshaw Mill. Kings Mill is now an antiques centre, Queen Street Mill is a Textile Museum, Primrose has been demolished after a fire, when it was being used to made beds. 
The mill engines.
Harle Syke is unique in having preserved two of its mill engines. The first is in Queen Street Mill and has never been moved but the second is preserved in the Science Museum in London. The Queen Street mill engine is an 1895 single tandem compound of 500 hp Corliss valves driving a flywheel while the London engine which came from Harle Syke mill is a twin compound with Corliss valves constructed in 1903 by Burnley Ironworks.

Flapless Air Vehicle Integrated Industrial Research is a research project at Cranfield University with collaboration form nine other universities and BAE Systems. Funding totaling $9.85 million USD comes from BAE Systems and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The project's goal is to create aircraft without ailerons, as ailerons, in addition to being heavy and requiring extensive maintenance, make it difficult for stealth aircraft to hide from radar. The project has created an unmanned aircraft named "Demon" which, although it still has ailerons, also uses fluidic controls to change direction in flight. The fluidic controls, in contrast to ailerons, do not move metal parts, but instead use pressurized air to change the direction of airflow over the wing surface. The plane does not need ailerons at all, and has flown successfully without them, but they were included as a backup in case the fluidic controls failed. The project aims to eventually implement the control system on a larger aircraft.

Kathy Hochul

Kathleen Courtney "Kathy" Hochul (pronounced HOKE-ul; born August 27, 1958) is an American politician who was the U.S. Representative for New York's 26th congressional district from June 1, 2011 to January 3, 2013. She prevailed in the four-candidate special election of May 24, 2011, to fill the seat left vacant by the resignation of Republican Chris Lee, and was the first Democrat to represent the district in 40 years.
Hochul served as the County Clerk of Erie County, New York from 2007 until 2011, when she assumed her seat in Congress. Previously, she was a deputy county clerk, a member of the Hamburg town board, a practicing attorney, and a legislative aide.
Hochul was defeated for re-election by Republican former Erie County Executive Chris Collins, after being redistricted to the 27th district. She then worked as a government relations specialist with Buffalo based M&T Bank and is incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo's running mate in the 2014 gubernatorial election.
Early life, education, and pre-congressional career.
Hochul was born Kathleen Courtney, the second oldest of the six children of John Courtney, then a college student and clerical worker, and Pat Courtney, a homemaker. Hochul's family struggled financially during her early years and for a time lived in a trailer near a steel plant. By the time Hochul was in college, however, her father was working for the information technology company which he later headed.
Hochul became politically active during her college years at Syracuse University, leading a boycott of the student bookstore over high prices and an unsuccessful effort to name the university stadium after running back Ernie Davis, an alumnus, instead of the Carrier Corporation. She received her B.A. degree from Syracuse in 1980 and her law degree from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. in 1984.
After graduating from law school, Hochul began working for a high-powered Washington D.C. law firm, but found the work unsatisfying. She then worked on Capitol Hill as a legal counsel-legislative assistant to U.S. Representative John LaFalce and U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan, and for the New York State Assembly, before seeking elected office. 
She became involved in local issues as a booster of small businesses who tried to counteract the effect of Walmart stores. She was elected as the Democratic and Conservative Party candidate to the Hamburg in November 1994. While on the town board, she led efforts to remove toll barriers on parts of the New York State Thruway system.
In May 2003, Erie County clerk David Swarts appointed Hochul as his deputy clerk. When Swarts left office in 2007, Governor Eliot Spitzer appointed Hochul to fill the post. Though she had been appointed county clerk by Spitzer, she opposed Spitzer's proposal to allow illegal immigrants to apply for a driver's license without producing a social security card. She said that if the proposal went into effect, she would call the sheriff's office to bring such applicants in for questioning. She was elected later in 2007 to fill the remainder of Swarts' term. She ran for reelection on four ballot lines: Democratic, Conservative, Independence and Working Families Party, defeating Republican Clifton Bergfeld in November 2010 with 80 percent of the vote.
U.S. House of Representatives.
2011 special election.
Hochul ran in the four-way special election race of May 24, 2011 to fill the seat in New York's 26th congressional district left vacant by the resignation of Republican Chris Lee. She was the Democratic Party and Working Families Party nominee. Hochul's residence in Hamburg, just outside the 26th district, became an issue during her campaign, though it did not legally disqualify her from seeking the seat. One month after her victory, she moved into the district, fulfilling a campaign promise.
The Republican and Conservative Party candidate, state legislator Jane Corwin, was at first strongly favored to win in the Republican-leaning district which had sent a Republican to Congress for the previous four decades. A late April poll had Corwin leading Hochul 36-31 percent; independent Tea Party candidate Jack Davis trailed at 23 percent. An early May poll however, gave Hochul a narrow 35–31 lead, and shortly thereafter the non-partisan "Rothenberg Political Report" called the race a "toss-up". Additional polling in the days immediately preceding the election had Hochul leading by four and six point margins. Additional polling in the days immediately preceding the election had Hochul leading by four- and six-point margins.
In a Washington Post article, it was noted that in the face of a possible upset victory but Hochul, there was already a “full blown spin war” about the meaning of the results. The article went on to say that, for Democrats, the close race was a result of “House Republicans’ budget plan authored by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan — and, in particular, his proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program.” For Republicans, it was the result of millionaire Jack Davis, who spent “millions to pull votes away from Republican Jane Corwin.” The article also stated that something being overlooked was that Hochul was “simply a stronger candidate than Republican Jane Corwin.” 
Hochul’s strength stemmed from starting her career as an aide to Senator Daniel Moynihan, who was “one of the most admired politicians in New York history.” She has been described as sweet and earnest. She was described as a successful campaigner, but as someone who can do that by “being not the least bit slick.” Hochul was linked to tangible local accomplishments, like when she “broke with then Gov. Eliot Spitzer (D) on license plates for illegal immigrants — and got a write-up in the New York Times for it.”
The seat was viewed as a difficult one to obtain for a Democrat, and “only a really solid campaigner could make it happen.” 
Hochul's victory was almost universally viewed as astonishing, given that the district is heavily Republican and that Corwin outspent her almost 2-1. 
The campaign featured a number of negative television ads, with nonpartisan FactCheck accusing both sides of "taking liberties with the facts." In particular, FactCheck criticized the Democrats' ads for claiming that the Republican candidate would "essentially end Medicare", even though the plan would leave Medicare intact for current beneficiaries. The organization also faulted the Republicans' for ads portraying Hochul as a puppet of former U.S. House Speaker Pelosi, and for claiming that Hochul planned to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.
Hochul was endorsed by EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women candidates, including those who are pro-choice. She was the fifth largest recipient of EMILY's List funds in 2011, receiving more than $27,000 in bundled donations from the organization. The "Democrat and Chronicle" endorsed Hochul "for her tenacity and independence", while The "Buffalo News" endorsed her for her positions on preserving Medicare and her record of streamlining government.
Hochul defeated Corwin 47 to 43 percent in the special election held on May 24, with Jack Davis receiving 9 percent, and Green Party candidate Ian Murphy receiving 1 percent of the vote. 
On the day of the election, it was reported that Hochul's impending victory would be “a serious blow to the GOP agenda, and, more specifically, Paul Ryan’s budget plan that would end Medicare as we know it.” 
It was also noted that when Democratic strategists were not considering Hochul a serious candidate, "It was Emily’s List and the Working Families Party, a union-backed grassroots party, that kept talking up Hochul—who ran on the third party’s ballot line, taking advantage of New York’s fusion law, which allows crossendorsements." Hochul achieved success widely due to her efforts in battling the Republican budget, which aimed to makes cuts to Medicaid and privatize Social Security.
2012 election.
In the 2012 election, Hochul's district was renumbered as the 27th District. She lost her re-election bid to Collins by a 51% to 49% margin.
Tenure.
Because her victory came in a special election and because it was an upset win that turned on a major issue, Hochul received major national and even international coverage. She has reportedly already established herself as an important player in Congress.
Over her years in local politics, Hochul had built reputation for focusing on local issues that mattered to her constituents and that make a difference to their pocketbooks. Since joining Congress, she has voted on every bill that has come before the House. 
In Hochul's first few weeks in office, she co-sponsored a couple bills with Brian Cogan to help streamline the passport acquisition process. She also met with the President about the economy and job creation and introduced a motion on the House to restore the Republican cuts to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She also quickly started looking for areas to reduce the deficit, open to reducing Medicaid spending, as long as it wasn't in the form of block grants offered to states, as proposed in the GOP budget blueprint. She also had spoken with President Obama about ending tax breaks for oil companies and protecting small businesses. 
While campaigning for Congress, Hochul defined herself as an "independent Democrat". In an interview with the "Lockport Union-Sun & Journal", she cited as examples of her independence her opposition to Spitzer's drivers' license program for illegal immigrants and her opposition to Governor David Paterson's proposal in 2010 to raise revenue by requiring all vehicle owners to buy new license plates.
On September 17, 2011, Robert J. McCarthy noted that Hochul and her election opponent Jack Davis were now bonding over their opposition to free trade. “We saw what happened with NAFTA; the promises never materialized,” she said of the North American Free Trade Agreement. “If I have to stand up to my own party on this, I'm willing to do so.” 
During her congressional campaign, Hochul favored offering incentives to develop alternative energy.
In June 2011, Hochul opposed legislation that would cut funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by 44 percent, on the ground that the CFTC curbs speculation in oil and the resulting layoffs of CFTC personnel would "make it easier for Big Oil companies and speculators to take advantage of ... consumers".
While running for the U.S. House, Hochul supported raising taxes on those making more than $500,000 per year. She opposed the new free trade agreements that were then under consideration, saying, "We don't need to look any further than Western New York to see that these policies do not work." She believes that free trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA have suppressed U.S. wages and benefits and caused job loss in the U.S.
Hochul called the summer 2011 debt ceiling issue "a distraction" to which the American people should not be subjected.
Hochul acknowledged during her campaign that substantial cuts must be made in the federal budget, and said she would consider cuts in all entitlement programs. However, she expressed opposition to the Republican plan that would re-form Medicare into a voucher system, saying it "would end Medicare as we know it". She said money could be saved in the Medicare program by eliminating waste and purchasing prescription drugs in bulk. She also said that the creation of more jobs would alleviate Medicare and Social Security budget shortfalls due to increased collections of payroll taxes.
On November 19, 2011, Brian Tumulty of WQRZ reported that Hochul had voted for a balanced budget amendment, which she called "a bipartisan solution." 
On September 16, 2011, David Weigel quoted Hochul on lowering Medicare costs: “We need to cut the underlying costs of health care, which are making Medicare more expensive. Democrats are in agreement...We have to make sure that we get equity with respect to prescription drugs – the drug prices under Medicare are obscenely high. Why are veterans at VA hospitals paying less for prescription drugs than people who are under Medicare Part D? That's an area we should go after. Medicare fraud is getting out of control...I think we should have Medicare cover home health care. Look at the savings we'd have if we covered home health care and tele-health services. Instead, people in rural areas have to go hospitals at the dead of the night. If we look at this holistically, we can cut the underlying costs.” 
Hochul expressed support for the 2010 health care reform legislation passed by the 111th Congress and said during her campaign that she would not vote to repeal it. In response to a constituent's question during a town-hall meeting in February 2012, she was booed for saying that the federal government was ‘‘not looking to the Constitution’’ under the Obama administration requirement that non-religious employers provide their workers with insurance coverage for birth control. A spokesman later stated that she'd misspoken, but did not clarify her answer. 
Hochul has said she is pro-choice on abortion. She supports civil marriage for same-sex couples, with no requirements on religious institutions.
Community activities.
Hochul is a founder and a member of the Board of Directors of Kathleen Mary House, a transitional home for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. She was also co-founder of the Village Action Coalition, and a member of the Board of Trustees at Immaculata Academy in Hamburg.
Personal life.
She is married to William Hochul, who serves as the United States Attorney for the Western District of New York. They reside in Snyder, New York, and are the parents of two children, William and Caitlin.
Controversies.
On the Constitution.
At a town hall meeting in Lancaster, New York, Kathy Hochul told the crowd that the federal government was "not looking to the Constitution" when mandating that religious organizations provide birth control to their employees. Video of her comment went viral.
County Clerk Backlog.
Following Kathy Hochul's departure as County Clerk, a back log of mail was discovered by newly elected County Clerk, Chris Jacobs. Millions of dollars were stored in boxes in unopened envelopes. As County Clerk, Kathy Hochul was in the process of implementing a new system, when she left to run in the special election and then to assume office. Thousands of dollars were spent in overtime to deposit checks and file unopened documents. However none of the un-cashed checks dated to Hochul's term as clerk.
Political future.
Hochul has terminated her campaign committee and is not running against Collins again in 2014. She had been speculated as a candidate for Mayor of Buffalo in 2017.
Lieutenant governor campaign.
On May 21, 2014, incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo nominated Hochul as his running mate in the 2014 gubernatorial election. If Cuomo and Hochul win, she will replace Robert Duffy and become Lieutenant Governor of New York.

Harvest Festival (Parks and Recreation)

"Harvest Festival" is the seventh episode of the third season of the American comedy television series "Parks and Recreation", and the 37th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 17, 2011. In the episode, Leslie and her co-workers hold Pawnee's harvest festival, the success of which will determine the future of the parks department. The festival faces several obstacles, including a supposed Native American curse, a missing miniature horse and a scandal-hungry media. Meanwhile, Ann tries to cope with her recent break-up, and April confesses her love to Andy, then becomes angry when he does not reciprocate.
Written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by Dean Holland, the episode marked the culmination of a seven-episode story arc about the harvest festival that began with the third season premiere, "Go Big or Go Home". Unlike the first six episodes of the season, it was not written and produced immediately following the second season, which had been done to accommodate actress Amy Poehler's pregnancy. The episode also does not feature Rob Lowe as he was originally only expected to be a guest star when the episode was conceived; however, he does return for subsequent episodes as a regular cast member.
The episode featured appearances by regular guest stars Mo Collins and Jay Jackson, as well as the first appearance by Jonathan Joss as the leader of a local Native American tribe. The harvest festival scenes were shot at Los Angeles Pierce College, and an aerial shot of the festival itself was the most expensive shot in the series. According to Nielsen Media Research, "Harvest Festival" was seen by 4.08 million household viewers, one of the lowest ratings of the series.
The episode received critical acclaim, with many reviewers calling it one of the show's best episodes as well as a major turning point in the series.
Plot.
With the Harvest Festival days away, Leslie (Amy Poehler) surprises everyone by booking Li'l Sebastian, a miniature horse and legendary Pawnee celebrity. Everyone is thrilled except Ben (Adam Scott), who doesn't understand the fascination. The chief of the local Wamapoke tribe, Ken Hotate (Jonathan Joss), visits the parks department and requests the harvest festival be moved, as it is built upon the site of a Wamapoke massacre. When Leslie explains it is too late, Ken warns them the festival may become cursed, although he privately tells the documentary crew that "there are two things know[s about white people: they love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses." Ann (Rashida Jones) works the harvest festival first aid tent, where she confides in Donna (Retta) that she has not taken the break-up with Chris (Rob Lowe) well. April (Aubrey Plaza) tells Andy (Chris Pratt) that she loves him, but grows angry when he replies, "Dude, shut up! That is awesomesauce!"
Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives to report on the festival and is determined to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with random people, starting with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.
On the Ferris wheel, with April and Andy arguing below him and Tom and Jerry arguing above him, an annoyed Ron (Nick Offerman) clears the air by announcing the obvious: April is mad at Andy for not telling her that he loves her back, and the missing Li'l Sebastian is Tom's fault. Andy tells April that he clearly loves her and they hug, and Tom apologizes to Jerry. Later, everyone spots Li'l Sebastian in the corn maze and recover him. Leslie learns the power outage was due to television crews plugging into the grid and overloading it. The only replacement generator in Pawnee is at the Wamapoke casino, and Leslie humbly asks Ken to loan it to her in exchanged for placing a Wamapoke cultural exhibit near the Harvest Festival entrance. Ken agrees, and during the festival opening the next morning, he performs a meaningless ceremony to remove the fake curse. People begin to swarm into the festival, and Ben returns to apologize to Leslie for leaving, admitting that he is not over his past. She reassures him the festival is as much his accomplishment as hers, and even has Ken break Ben's "curse", although Ken's gesture is also completely meaningless. At the end, Ben appears to have been won over by Li'l Sebastian, but admits to the camera crew that he still fails to see the appeal and remains as baffled as ever.
Production.
"Harvest Festival" was written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by Dean Holland. The episode marked the culmination of a seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, "Go Big or Go Home", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: "What I like about the show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking about this thing, it talks about it in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun."
"Harvest Festival" was the first episode of the season written and produced separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended as part of an early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: "Andy is put into a situation that a lot of people have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers."
Rob Lowe, a regular cast member with "Parks and Recreation", did not appear in "Harvest Festival" because the actor was originally slated to only appear in the first six episodes of the season as a guest star. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe joined the cast as a permanent cast member, and his character Chris Traeger will return in the next episode, "Camping", as well as all subsequent episodes. "Harvest Festival" included guest appearances by Mo Collins and Jay Jackson as, respectively, Joan Callamezzo and Perd Hapley, two Pawnee television journalists who have appeared in multiple "Parks and Recreation" episodes. It also featured the first guest appearance of Jonathan Joss as Wamapoke tribe leader Ken Hotate. Joss previously voiced John Redcorn in the animated television series "King of the Hill", which was co-created by "Parks and Recreation" co-creator Greg Daniels. Schur said while writing about the Native American curse, the writing staff wanted it to be the local media that turned it into an issue rather than the citizens of Pawnee, because they felt it would be too cartoonish and unbelievable for the residents to take it so seriously.
Due to budget constraints, the "Parks and Recreation" set department did not build the harvest festival and corn maze sets, but instead filmed the episode at the annual Halloween Harvest Festival at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college in California. Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival at the end of the episode was the most expensive in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, "the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now". "Harvest Festival" was screened for members of the media during a January 2011 NBC press junket. Afterward, the reporters were taken to the set of "Parks and Recreation" where they were able to greet and pose for photos with the actual miniature horse who played Li'l Sebastian. Shortly after the episode aired, a "Producer's Cut" version was made available on the official NBC website. It was about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations, including an extended cold open with the parks department meeting Li'l Sebastian, and additional scenes of Leslie meeting with Pawnee constituents before the Harvest Festival.
Cultural references.
When Ben fails to understand the appeal of Li'l Sebastian, Ron explains the miniature horse has an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, a school in Indiana, the state where "Parks and Recreation" series is set. In a later scene, Ben compares Leslie to a Jedi, a type of warrior in the science fiction franchise "Star Wars", prompting Leslie and Tom to mock him as a nerd. During one scene, Ken Hotate says, "I know two things about white people: they love Matchbox Twenty, and they are terrified of curses." The former refers to an American rock band, which is later also featured on the marquee of an exterior shot of a Wamapoke casino. (The extended cut replaces Matchbox Twenty with Rachael Ray in both instances.) Ann claims that, while distraught from her breakup with Chris, she bought $700-worth of candles from Anthropologie, a retail store that sells women's apparel and home accessories.
One of the harvest festival booths features Pawnee celebrity Aunt Tilda, the fictional aunt of basketball player Larry Bird, who is from Indiana. "American Girl", a song by the rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, plays during one scene showing an overview of the harvest festival. A news report about the supposed curse is presented in a Taiwanese animation clip featuring Leslie and Ken Hotate, in the style of the animation company Next Media Animation. While interviewing Hotate, Perd Hapley compared the curse to the horror film "Poltergeist" (1982). Several commentators compared the man who flirted with Ann to the characters of "Jersey Shore", an MTV reality series about young people living in a house by the Jersey Shore beach.
Reception.
Ratings.
In its original American broadcast, "Harvest Festival" was seen by an estimated 4.08 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It was one of the lowest ratings of the series to date, and marked a 25 percent drop from the previous original episode, "Indianapolis". The ratings suffered in part because its lead-in show, "The Office", was a repeat; all the other NBC comedy shows that Thursday, including "30 Rock", "Community", "Perfect Couples" and "Outsourced", also saw lower ratings than their previous episodes. "Parks and Recreation" was defeated in its 9:30 p.m. timeslot by the Fox comedy-drama series "Bones", which was seen by 11.34 million households; the ABC medical drama "Private Practice (TV series)", which was seen by 5.97 million households; and CBS coverage of NCAA basketball, which was seen by 4.44 million household. In network television, it defeated only a remake of the CW Network drama "Nikita", which drew 1.37 million households.
Reviews.
"Harvest Festival" received generally positive reviews. "New York" magazine writer Steve Kandell called it the most pivotal episode of the season in terms of "resolving and resetting narrative stakes", as well as the most complex from a production perspective. Kandell wrote, "There's something that feels particularly satisfying about watching a wholly sympathetic, albeit fictional, character like Leslie Knope do well by her own ambition and by her friends.""Entertainment Weekly" writer Ken Tucker said the episode placed "Parks and Recreation" "squarely in the tradition of great gentle-hearted sitcoms" that treated its characters "with equal affection, and has relatively little patience for irony and cool detachment". He praised Amy Poehler's performance, and enjoyed how the characters' excitement over Li'l Sebastian demonstrated how "in some parts of this great land, there are people who aren’t jaded, who are open to wonderment, who find vessels in which to pour their joy". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said "Harvest Festival" may be his favorite episode of the season thus far, and demonstrates how the series has evolved. While in the first season he said Leslie was too over-the-top in a relatively ordinary setting, Sepinwall said this episode showed "Parks and Recreation" "has successfully made the rest of Pawnee seem as believably crazy as Leslie, if not moreso". TV Squad television reviewer Maureen Ryan called "Harvest Festival" a "delightful, comedically deft episode, one that depicts the mildly demented world of Pawnee in loving detail".
Joel Keller, also of TV Squad, called it one of the best episodes of the season, and that it provided each member of the ensemble cast moments to shine. He praised how the episode combined the "funny small-townness of a place like Pawnee and the realities of being in city government". James Poniewozik of "Time" magazine called it a "splendid" episode that "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". "Punchline Magazine" writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" and particularly enjoyed the "sweet non-aggressive fighting" between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. "TV Guide" writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, "but like the best of "Parks", these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the "Montreal Gazette" praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot "wildly politically incorrect, but funny". "National Post" writer Scott Stinson said "Parks and Recreation" "continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a "welcome development" for both characters.
Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann enjoyed the new direction Ann's character was taking, as well as how "Harvest Festival" accurately portrays small-town life. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode "put a great cap on the first portion of the season". He called Andy and April "a recipe for excellent comedy" and called the slowly developing romance of Ben and Leslie extremely rewarding. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow called it a "pure delight from beginning to end" and a good entry point for newcomers to the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called the episode "celebration of the whackjobs that live in Pawnee and how their singular focus can make for some adorably naive comedy". While he praised the main subplot, he said it was too early in April and Andy's relationship for them to declare their love for each other, and said April's declaration "came out of nowhere". Matt Fowler of IGN said it was not his favorite episode, as the jokes about Ben's past felt repetitive compared to past episodes, and the April and Andy subplot "fell a little flat". However, he said it was "chock full of dozens of little moments that make the entire episode worthwhile", and particularly praised the Native American curse and the parody of the media.

Food Day

Food Day in the United States is celebrated annually on October 24 and oftentimes throughout the month. The holiday was initially started in 1975 by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in an attempt to create an event similar to Earth Day. Food Day in the U.S. was created to raise awareness about the increasing industrialization of American agriculture, raising food prices, hunger, and the American diet and health crisis. Food Day in the U.S. only lasted until 1977, until 2011, when CSPI revived the National Food Day campaign. The Food Day initiative is now run by Food Day.org within CSPI.
Food Day is still working to raise awareness surrounding food issues in the U.S. such as nutrition education, sustainable agriculture, hunger, farm animal welfare, and farm and food service worker rights. Food Day in the U.S. is typically celebrated by nationwide and local events to educate people about the food system and/or to gain support for policies that event hosts deem to be improvements for the current food system, such as improved nutrition labels, funding for SNAP, and decreased use of antibiotics in food-producing animals typically in factory farms.
2,300 events took place across the country during Food Day in 2011, 3,200 in 2012, and over 4,700 events in 2013. Events have been hosted by a variety of different groups including local governments, food co-ops, schools, college campuses, non-profits, businesses, government agencies, food banks, farms and farmers, and restaurants.
Food Day or Food Day Canada is a culinary celebration that originated in Canada as "The World's Longest BBQ" in reaction to the BSE crisis of 2003. This economic crisis for farmers was a trade embargo by the US on Canadian beef, based on a single case of BSE (or mad cow disease) in Alberta, Canada. Since that year, Food Day has evolved into a celebration by chefs from across Canada. Food Day happens every day in Canada on the Saturday of the August long weekend (also known as the Civic Holiday Weekend). Food Day was founded by Canadian culinary pioneer, Anita Stewart.

Birkenhead Central Library

Birkenhead Central Library is one of twenty-four libraries (as of March 2011) forming the Wirral Library Service in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. The library is located on Borough Road, Birkenhead.
History.
The original Birkenhead Central Library was opened in 1856 in a different part of Birkenhead from the present-day site. At the time, it was the first public library in the country in an unincorporated borough. The current central library building on Borough Road was opened in 1934 by King George V and is designated by Wirral Council as a historic site.
Services and activities.
The library offers the traditional lending service for books including large print, foreign language titles, talking books and digital audio and video media, newspaper and magazine reading and local community information. There is also a dedicated children's library and a reference library on the upper floor containing extensive local archives. The library also offers exhibition/display facilities and room hire.

Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy

The Imperial Roman Catholic Theological Academy () was an institution of higher education preparing Roman Catholic theologians in the Russian Empire. The Academy granted master's and doctorate degrees in theology and was designed to prepare officers for senior positions in the Catholic Church hierarchy. It originated at the Vilnius University, but was transferred to Saint Petersburg in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1831. The Tsarist authorities wanted to exercise greater control over the Academy and implement Russification policies. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Academy was moved to Poland where it became the Catholic University of Lublin. A new theological seminary was established in Moscow in 1993; it moved to the premises of the historical Saint Petersburg Academy in 1995.
In Vilnius.
The academy traced its roots to the Supreme Theological Seminary of Vilnius University established in 1803–1808 in the Augustine monastery. After the Uprising of 1831, the University was closed leaving only two Academies – the Academy of Medicine–Surgery and the Theological Academy. Both of them were subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (as opposed to Ministry of Education or Bishop of Vilnius). Vilnius Theological Academy was officially established on July 1, 1833. Courses included theology, scripture, homiletics, Biblical hermeneutics and archaeology, history of Christianity, canon law, logic, ethics, classical, Polish, and Russian languages and literature, world and Russian history. The lectures were held in Latin and Russian languages. The Academy had about 40 students; the section devoted to the Armenian Catholic Church had 7 students. Its rectors were Alojzy Osiński (former lecturer at the Liceum Krzemienieckie; 1770–1842) and Antoni Fijałkowski (former professor at Vilnius University; 1797–1883). The Academy had 8 faculty members, who included philologist Leon Borowski, philosopher Anioł Dowgird, historian Paweł Kukolnik. The Academy closely cooperated with Vilnius Priest Seminary. Around 1840, the Tsarist authorities suspected that the students were planning another uprising. Therefore the academy, including its students, professors, and library, was moved to Saint Petersburg in August 1842. The Academy of Medicine–Surgery was also closed, transferring its assets to the University of Kiev. Vilnius and Lithuania were left without an institution of higher education.
In Saint Petersburg.
In Saint Petersburg, the Academy settled in the former palace of the Russian Academy on the Vasilyevsky Island in 1844. The purchase and reconstruction of the premises was financed with funds of closed Catholic monasteries. The consecration ceremony of the palace was attended by Emperor Nicholas I. On that occasion the Academy was granted the title "Imperial Academy". All other Catholic academies became its subordinates. The number of students was limited to 40; the limit was increased to 60 after the Roman Catholic Clerical Academy in Warsaw was closed in 1867. From 1885 to 1917, the Academy published students' research papers in a yearbook. Most gifted students were sent for further studies to western universities. In 1906, the Academy had 13 faculty members. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Academy was closed and moved to Poland where it became the Catholic University of Lublin.
The Academy continued to prepare theologians for western provinces of the Russian Empire. The students were mostly Polish and Lithuanian, with some Belarusians, Latvians, Germans. Its famous alumni and faculty included Fabijan Abrantovich, Antanas Baranauskas, Jan Cieplak, Antoni Czerwiński, saint Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński, Vladas Jurgutis, Aleksander Kakowski, Josef Alois Kessler, Mykolas Krupavičius, Zygmunt Łoziński, Maironis, blessed Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius, Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas, Justinas Pranaitis, Mečislovas Reinys, Franz Anton Schiefner, Juozapas Skvireckas, Boļeslavs Sloskāns, Julijans Vaivods, Motiejus Valančius.

Where Do I Go from You

"Where Do I Go from You" is a song written by Don Cook, Clint Daniels, and Ryan Tyndell and recorded by American country music singer Clay Walker. It was released in August 2010 as the second single to his album "She Won't Be Lonely Long". It peaked at #26 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts, becoming his 28th top 40 hit on the chart.
Background.
Prior to "Where Do I Go from You" being released as a single, Walker expressed that he thought "Summer Song" would be a better choice. He explained in an interview with "CMT", "There can only be one boss, and we know who that is. But it's OK. That's the way it goes." In an interview with "GAC", Walker explained the song by saying, "Out of all the songs I've recorded since "What's It To You," my first record, this has that youthful energy I had on that first song. Production-wise it's as modern as anything I've ever done. I'm pretty much considered a new traditionalist, but I do have R&B and pop roots mixed in." Walker told the "Albuquerque Journal", "I like the new single that's out right now because it's musically just one of those songs you can groove to right away. It's not one that you have to think about. So I like the fact that my record label picked it as the follow-up."
Content.
"Where Do I Go from You" is about a man who is not sure what to do anymore after his girlfriend has left him. He tries to forget about her but her memory keeps coming back to him and he remains lost about where to go from her.
Reception.
Karlie Justus of "The 9513" gave the song a thumbs up rating. She described the song as "pairing a well-crafted melody with a solid, engaging performance that’s both a throwback to the singer’s heyday and a worthwhile contribution to contemporary country." Matt Bjorke of "Roughstock" gave the song four-and-a-half stars and described it as having "an interesting lyric and an interesting and solid mainstream melody." Alison Bonaguro of "CMT" gave the song a positive remark writing "With mandolin and steel behind him, he seems to have one-upped himself musically and vocally." 
Amanda Johnson of" Digital Rodeo" wrote "His emotional tenor and strong country vocals keep the future alive for this great artist and his new single. I predict he has his next Top 5 on the line and maybe a #1?" The website "Urban Country Blog" gave the song a positive review writing "With radio making a slight shift to more traditional material again, a grown-up break-up song such as this should do well."
Chart performance.
"Where Do I Go from You" debuted at number 60 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart dated August 14, 2010, and reached a peak of number 26 in March 2011.

Corridor of Mirrors (film)

Corridor of Mirrors is a 1948 British drama film directed by Terence Young and starring Eric Portman, Edana Romney and Barbara Mullen. It was based on a novel by Christopher Massie. It is notable as being Christopher Lee's first film. Visually one of the most engaging pieces of cinema made in Britain in 1948, Corridor of Mirros extends the French post-war aesthetic typical of Jean Cocteau's 1950 film Orphée (Orpheus) and Jean Gremillion's noirish Pattes Blanches (White Paws, 1949), another neo-realist fairy story. Terence Young's film resonates on the same wavelength as Kenneth Anger's experimental film Eaux d'artifice (1953) made in France shortly after Anger's meeting with Cocteau. Surprisingly, neither Anger or Young's films drew the type of critical reception they deserved and both still languish. Corridor of Mirrors is an odd experiment in the realm of fairy tale set in modern times and thus perfect fare for audiences of the period but it may have been too dark or too rigorous a fantasy to please. It slips easily between an elaborate, at times Baroque world of illusion and the greyish realities of artistic life just after war. Eric Portman plays the aesthete-bluebeard seducer. Edana Romney plays a married woman who transitions from housewife to muse and finally godess laden with important antique jewels and stunning dresses. Portman's acting is both insightful and highly charged; he is like a man who commits the perfect murder by other means...he never kills. As a collector and seeker of perfection he enhances and perfects. Romney is the model for his artfully constructed profound and sparkling mirror cosmos. Romney adapts herself to his ambitions and merges with his closet full of feminine ornament. As a seemingly asexual couple they achieve their mythic purpose and merge with time itself, instead of death. Young went on to direct an extremely diverse though less adventurous list of films among them two of the James Bond films.

Yara Belle Plaine

Yara Belle Plaine Inc is a nitrate-based fertilizer manufacture based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and part of the Yara International group of companies. 
Originally the company was established in 1984 as SaskFerco Products Inc., a joint venture between Cargil (50%), the Government of Saskatchewan (49%), Citibank Canada (1%), to construct a plant near Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan at a cost of $435 million for the production of granular urea and anhydrous ammonia. SaskFerco became one of the largest North America manufacturers of granular urea (2,850 tonnes per day capacity) and anhydrous ammonia (1,860 tonnes per day) and urea ammonium nitrate (670 tonnes per day). The plant also became the largest consumer of natural gas in the province. 
In 2008 the company was sold by the province and its partner at that time The Mosaic Company to Yara International for $1.6 billion; the name of the company was changed to Yara Belle Plaine Inc, and it continued to be headquartered in Regina.

Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1905)

Frederick George Lee (24 May 1905 – 19 November 1977) played first-class cricket in 10 matches for Somerset between 1925 and 1927. He was born at Chard, Somerset and died at Taunton, also in Somerset.
Fred Lee was the second cricketer of this name to play for Somerset: he was not related to the earlier Fred Lee, and nor was he related to Frank Lee and Jack Lee, the London-born brothers who were his near-contemporaries in the Somerset side.
Lee was a tail-end batsman and a bowler, though neither his batting nor his bowling style is recorded. He recorded his best bowling figures in his first match, with three wickets for 103 runs against Yorkshire in 1925, and his score of eight in Somerset's first innings was also the highest of his short career.

Fred Fussell

Frederick Morris Fussell (October 7, 1895 – October 23, 1966) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates. Fussell was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighed 155 pounds.
Career.
Fussell was born in Sheridan, Missouri, in 1895. He started his professional baseball career in 1922 with the Chicago Cubs. That season, he played in three MLB games in September and October and had a win–loss record of 1–1. In 1923, Fussell mostly pitched in relief for Chicago. He appeared in 28 games, going 3–5 and tying for the team-lead with three saves.
Fussell spent the next several years in the minor leagues. He played for the Pacific Coast League's Seattle Indians in 1924 and 1925 and then went to the Texas League's Wichita Falls Spudders. In 1927, he won a career-high 21 games for the Spudders, and he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates that December for Mike Cvengros and Ike Danning. He pitched well the following spring and made the Pirates roster.
Fussell was a major league starter during the 1928 season. In 159.2 innings pitched, he went 8–9 with a 3.61 earned run average. In 1929, he was a reliever, and his ERA jumped up to 8.62. He was released after the season and never played in the majors again.
During the 1930s, Fussell pitched for various teams in the International League, including the Buffalo Bisons and Syracuse Chiefs. In 1933, he threw a no-hitter in a night game; he was subsequently nicknamed "Moonlight Ace". Fussell's professional baseball career ended in 1939. He retired with a career minor league record of 150–118 to go along with his 14–17 major league one.
In his later years, Fussell lived in Syracuse, New York, and worked as a lathe operator. Late in Fussell's life, Baseball Hall of Fame historian Lee Allen wrote a piece about him in a "Baseball Digest" article. He died in 1966.

Ventarura

Ventarura is a genus of extinct vascular plants of the Early Devonian (around ). Fossils were found in the Windyfield chert, Rhynie, Scotland. Some features, such as bivalved sporangia borne laterally and the anatomy of the xylem, relate this genus to the zosterophylls. Other features are unclear due to poor preservation.
Description.
Fossils of "Ventarura" were found in the Windyfield chert, slightly separate from the better-known Rhynie chert, both located near the village of Rhynie, Scotland. Only fragmentary fossils were found, the longest being around 12 cm long. Stems (axes) of two kinds were found, although without clear connections between them. Aerial stems were leafless, smooth and dichotomously branched. They contained an exarch xylem strand containing G-type tracheids. Alone among the Rhynie chert plants, there was evidence of sclerenchyma – supporting tissue made up of dead cells with thick cell walls. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne on the sides of the stems, attached without clear stalks. They consisted of two circular to pear-shaped 'valves', one slightly narrower facing the stem, one away from it. Sporangia may have formed a two-rowed spike or strobilus. Spores were shed via a slit at the top of the sporangium between thickened valve borders. Spores were of one kind, about 67 µm in diameter, without trilete marks.
What are thought to be the underground stems of "Ventarura" had single-celled hairs, presumably rhizoids, on all sides. They branched irregularly and more often compared to aerial stems.
Phylogeny.
"Ventarura" was described too late to be included in the cladistic studies published by Kenrick and Crane in 1997 which are the source of much of the information on the phylogeny of early land plants (see Polysporangiophytes: Taxonomy). The shape of the sporangia and their lateral position as well as the anatomy of the xylem show a clear relationship to the zosterophylls. However, the arrangement of the sporangia is difficult to determine from the fossil specimens. Zosterophylls are thought to be the earliest diverging group of lycophytes, a group which includes modern clubmosses and relatives.

Totem Bight State Historical Park

Totem Bight State Historical Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located north of Ketchikan.
History.
In 1938, the United States Forest Service used Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) funds to hire skilled carvers from among the older Native Alaskans to repair or duplicate totem poles that were abandoned when the natives moved to communities where work was available. The CCC project put the community house and 15 totem poles in place. At statehood in 1959, title to the land passed from the federal government to the State of Alaska. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 27, 1970.

Double limit theorem

In hyperbolic geometry, Thurston's double limit theorem gives condition for a sequence of quasi-Fuchsian groups to have a convergent subsequence. It was introduced in and is a major step in Thurston's proof of the hyperbolization theorem for the case of manifolds that fiber over the circle.
Statement.
By Bers's theorem, quasi-Fuchsian groups (of some fixed genus) are parameterized by points in "T"×"T", where "T" is Teichmüller space of the same genus. Suppose that there is a sequence of quasi-Fuchsian groups corresponding to points ("g""i", "h""i") in "T"×"T". Also suppose that the sequences "g""i", "h""i" converge to points μ,μ′ in the Thurston boundary of Teichmüller space of projective measured laminations. If the points μ,μ′ have the property that any nonzero measured lamination has positive intersection number with at least one of them, then the sequence of quasi-Fuchsian groups has a subsequence that converges algebraically.
