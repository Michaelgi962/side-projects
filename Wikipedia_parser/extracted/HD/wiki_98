Stéphane Bahoken (born 28 May 1992 in Grasse) is a French footballer who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 side OGC Nice. Stéphane is the son of Paul Bahoken, who played for the Cameroon national football team at the 1982 FIFA World Cup as a forward.
Club career.
OGC Nice.
Stéphane began his professional career at Nice, having spend seven years at the club's academy since at the age of twelve. On the final game of the season, Stéphane made his debut, coming on as a substitute in the 79th minutes for Julien Sablé, in a 2-1 loss against Valenciennes. Coincidentally, his debut was before his birthday. Despite making five appearance in the 2011-12 season, Stéphane signed his first professional contract on a three year contract.
It wasn't until the 2012-13 season, which was a first team breakthrough for Stéphane as he starts to receive a first team place despite mostly coming on as a substitute. It couldn't get worse for Stéphane, as his season was mostly overshadowed because of his fractured fibula, which sustained in training and was out for several month. While playing in the club reserve, Stéphane was suspended for three games after an off the pitch incident.
On the last day of the transfer window, Stéphane was linked with a loan move to Le Havre, but the move was broken down soon after. Despite a failed move, Stéphane scored the first two goals in a 2-0 win over Montpellier on 10 March 2013. After the match, Stéphane says scoring the first two goals gives him confidences.
St Mirren (loan).
Stéphane joined Scottish Premiership side St. Mirren on loan on 30 August 2013. Stéphane revealed he was recommended by former team-mates and St. Mirren himself, Esmaël Gonçalves. After playing just four times for St Mirren, he returned to his parent club when the loan was cancelled on 31 December 2013. While at St. Mirren, Stéphane was known to have a bad attitude, describing himself as "a spoilt kid".
Upon his return from loan Stéphane was to be loaned back out to CA Bastia, but due to regulation restrictions imposed by the LFP it was confirmed he could not play for three clubs in one season. Following this decision, Bahoken returned to St. Mirren to complete his season long loan. Stéphane says he rejoined St. Mirren following talks with Manager Claude Puel, as well as, his family. Following his second spell, Manager Danny Lennon urged fans to stand by Stéphane, due to shown 'great desire' and shown to have a "positive attitude". After returning to the club, Bahoken failed to make another appearance before his unsuccessful loan spell ended.
International.
Stéphane is eligible to play for Cameroon national football team through his father.

Bastille (band)

Bastille (stylised as BΔSTILLE) are an English rock band formed in London in 2010. They began as a solo project by singer-songwriter Dan Smith, who later decided to form a band. The four-piece consists of members; Smith, Chris Wood, William Farquarson and Kyle Simmons. The name of the band derives from Bastille Day – an event celebrated on Smith's birthday, 14 July.
In December 2010, EMI Music announced that they had offered Bastille a record contract with Virgin Records. Their debut single, "Overjoyed" was subsequently released in April 2012. Their first studio album, titled "Bad Blood", was released in March 2013 and debuted atop the UK Albums Chart. The band was nominated for four Brit Awards at the 2014 ceremony, including for British Breakthrough Act, British Group, British Single of the Year and British Album of the Year, winning for British Breakthrough Act. As of February 2014, Bastille have sold over 2.07 million records in the UK alone.
History.
Formation and early releases.
The band initially included two other musicians on violin and cello, but dwindled down to the four current members. Smith, Wood, Farquarson, and Simmons played together before the band was started, but all of their first songs were written and recorded by Smith.
Bastille debuted in June 2010 with their limited edition 7"/45 rpm single featuring the two tracks "Flaws" and "Icarus". Released through London-based independent record label, Young & Lost Club, only 300 copies were pressed. This was followed by the release of the EP "Laura Palmer" later in 2011. The title track was rerecorded in Simlish (the in-game jibberish language) for Electronic Arts' "The Sims 3: Supernatural", released in September 2012. After debuting further tracks online through sites such as YouTube and MySpace, the band received a great amount of attention from media and fans. The group subsequently secured a few support slots, and later performed at major UK festivals including Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight, Redfest and Blissfields. Their music has also been used on the TV soap "Hollyoaks", "Made in Chelsea" and "The Vampire Diaries".
The band also recorded and released a two part mixtape titled "Other People's Heartache" for free. The mixtapes featured the band covering songs such as "Titanium" by David Guetta, "No Scrubs (No Angels)" by TLC, and "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac.
"Bad Blood" and "All This Bad Blood" (2012–present).
On 27 April 2012, their first official single release, "Overjoyed", was released through Virgin Records, as confirmed by EMI on 1 May 2012. Following its video premiere in November 2011, popular music publication, "Q" Magazine introduced the track as its 'Track of the Day' for 7 March 2012. The second single to be released from the upcoming debut studio album, "Bad Blood", was the title-track, "Bad Blood". An accompanying video for the single was released on the band's official VEVO channel on 29 June 2012, and digitally through Virgin Records on 20 August 2012. Bastille were also named 'New Band of the Day' by British newspaper "The Guardian" in July 2012. The song charted moderately at number 90 in the United Kingdom, and saw the group's first entry into the chart. August 2012 saw the band perform at UK festivals; Reading and Leeds, as well as supporting British singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé. They later played a small headlining tour, titled 'Flaws Tour' in October 2012, with Swiss Lips as their support act. Their third single, a re-release of their first 7" non-album single "Flaws", was a commercial success, earning the group their first position in the UK Top 40, debuting at number-twenty-one. The song Oblivion was featured in Season 4 Episode 9 of The Vampire Diaries in December 2012. 
In February 2013, Bastille confirmed the release of the fourth single to be taken from "Bad Blood", "Pompeii".

Their debut album "Bad Blood" was released on 4 March 2013, and placed at number one in the UK Albums Chart .

On Saturday 6 July the band headlined their first UK summer music festival at Blissfields. Smith was quoted as saying "We're massively excited about our first ever headline slot at a festival. Particularly because we love Blissfields so much, and because they've been so supportive to us over the last couple of years." The performance coincided with the band appearing on the cover of a national music publication, Notion magazine, for the first time. On 24 August 2013, "Things We Lost in the Fire" was released as sixth and the last single from the band's debut album. A music video for the song was shot in Vilnius and Kėdainiai, Lithuania.

Rhinosteus

Rhinosteus is a genus of small to medium selenosteid arthrodire placoderms known from the Upper Frasnian Kellwasserkalk facies of Late Devonian Germany and Morocco.
"Rhinosteus" is a typical genus of Kellwasserkalk selenosteids, with short cheeks, and slender inferognathal plates. However, two of the species, "R. traquairi", and "R. tuberculatus", have long, pointed rostrums, and tubercles on the plates. In "R. traquairi", the rostrum is sharply pointed, extending beyond the snout, and the tubercles are small and irregularly placed. In "R. tuberculatus", the rostrum is bluntly pointed, and the tubercles are large and plentiful. The species, "R. parvulus", has a blunt rostrum that does not extend beyond the snout, and lacks tuberculation all together. The average skull length of "R. traquairi" is about 11 centimetres. The average skull length of "R. tuberculatus" is 15 centimetres, while that of "R. parvulus" is 4 to 6 centimetres.
"R. traquairi" and "R. tuberculatus" are both endemic to Bad Wildungen. "R. parvulus" is also found in Bad Wildungen. Rücklin (2011) discusses how specimens of small "Rhinosteus" have been found in the Kellwasserkalk facies of the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, and are tentatively referred to "R. parvulus" due primarily to their small size.

Deacon Andrew Hetfield House

Deacon Andrew Hetfield House, also known as the Hetfield House or the Dutch Oven House, is a historical house in Mountainside, Union County, New Jersey, United States. It was built around 1763 by Deacon Andrew Hetfield, who was a Presbyterian deacon in Westfield. The Hetfield House was nicknamed "the Dutch Oven House" during its stint as an antique store during the 1930s-1980s.
The house has been moved twice: once to shift it 50 feet back when they were widening the nearby highway, and a second relocation in 1985 to save it from bulldozing. Reportedly, the house suffered minimal structural damage from the second move (one windowpane was lost).
The Hetfield House has been expanded over the years; as of 1830, the simple colonial farmhouse had been transformed “into a center-hall Georgian residence” (New Jersey Historical Commission, p. 24).

A typical VoIP gateway has interfaces to both IP networks and PSTN (Public switched telephone network) or POTS (Plain old telephone service) telephone services. The gateway may be configured to use these in several ways, including:
The PSTN interface is often either duplicated as, or can act as, connections for both a foreign exchange station (FXS) and a foreign exchange office (FXO). An FXS interface connects to FXO devices, such as local analogue telephone handsets or the exchange side of a PABX. The FXO interface connects to FXS devices, such as the PSTN.
A relatively potent device is needed to use better compression formats, such as G.729a; a relatively inexpensive and simple device can easily handle a similar function using more bandwidth over G.711. Any device capable of delivering audio in G.711 via Internet in either way can be considered a VOIP Gateway, but one that is capable of sending and receiving simultaneously will perform better. One with support for more codecs will usually be able to perform better in a range of situations, such as restricted bandwidth, though doing so is not always easy to differentiate. The packets of data are quickly sent (as little as a few milliseconds between packets), most often using UDP. A lost packet or two will not usually result in any noticeable degradation of the signal.
Using G.711 as the codec, it is possible to use a fax machine or modem via these devices without issues. This is mostly due to G.711 being a relatively simple compression audio stream. Other codecs will not usually perform this task.
Any modern PC with a microphone and speakers (or a headset serving both those tasks) is capable of acting as a VoIP gateway. This still requires an Internet connection and a SIP relay. Most SIP relays are commercial and charge either pay-per-minute or a flat rate for unlimited service on a number of channels.

Karl Wiesenburg

Karl Wiesenburg was a Mississippi statesmen, lawyer, public servant, and resident of Pascagoula, Mississippi. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned home to help develop Jackson County, Mississippi, into a thriving industrial complex. Wiesenburg is best known for his opposition to Governor Ross Barnett’s attempt to deny the enrollment of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi.
Biography.
Otto Karl Wiesenburg was born in Rosedale, Long Island, New York on August 1, 1911 and attended public high school in New York City. He arrived in Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1931 as a radio operator on a U.S. Coast Guard vessel and spent his life there working to improve the city, Jackson County, and the State of Mississippi. He served in the Coast Guard from December 3, 1929 to December 2, 1934 advancing from apprentice seaman to Radioman 2nd Class. While he did not complete high school before leaving New York to join the Coast Guard, he was a self-educated man who studied law by reading law books during his days at sea in the Coast Guard. In 1933, he passed the Mississippi bar examination, was admitted to the Mississippi Bar on March 27, 1933 and practiced law in Pascagoula until the day of his death on June 18, 1990. His law practice was one of the most respected in the state and he was described as a man of integrity by the "Mississippi Press" newspaper. 
Public Service.
Devoted to public service, Wiesenburg was appointed to the Pascagoula Port Commission in 1941 and served as its president. Although he had met his military obligation with five year’s service in the Coast Guard, he joined the U.S. Army after Pearl Harbor on May 2, 1942 and served overseas for 42 months in World War II as a radio operator in India, Burma, and China rising to the rank of Captain. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and The Asiatic/Pacific Medal with two combat stars. After the war, he continued his military service in the U. S. Army Reserve serving as commanding officer of the 845th Signal Service Battalion before retiring as a Lt. Colonel in 1964.
Wiesenburg served as city attorney to both Pascagoula and Ocean Springs and as attorney for the Pascagoula Port Authority and attorney for the Jackson County Board of Supervisors. He also served for one term on the Pascagoula City Council. In 1956, he was elected to the Mississippi Legislature where served until 1964. He was voted the Outstanding Freshman Legislator in 1956. During his eight years, he authored significant legislation for south Mississippi including the County Zoning Act, State Ports Act, Water Safety and Boating Act, Pat Harrison Waterway Commission Act, and the Jackson County Campus - Mississippi Gulf Coast Jr. College Act. He also authored the landmark Jackson County Port Authority Act that created the port of Pascagoula, including the industrial area of Bayou Casotte. The Jackson County Port Authority considers him the father of the Port of Pascagoula.
Meredith Incident.
During the period when James Meredith entered the University of Mississippi as its first black student, over the opposition of Governor Ross Barnett and the Mississippi Legislature, Wiesenburg was one of two legislators, the other being Joe Wroten of Greenville, who took a strong stand for civil rights and observance of the law. Wiesenburg stated of the Barnett administration that, "His administration will go down as the worst since Reconstruction days." He wrote a five-part series of articles titled "The Oxford Disaster...Price of Defiance" that was published in the Pascagoula newspaper "The Chronicle" between December 17–21, 1962. The articles detailed the applicable federal and state laws that had been violated and stated that the Governor’s action had followed “the road to riot” and that the resulting bloodshed in Oxford was the “price of defiance.” Ira B. Harkey Jr. editor of the "The Chronicle" won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1963 for his anti-segregationist editorials and reporting of the James Meredith incident. Others also took notice of Wiesenburg's strong stand for the rule of law. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy wrote of Wiesenburg in a letter to the federal attorney in Oxford, “Tell for me that he is the one who deserves a Pulitzer Prize or more. It is all well for we in the North to talk about these matters. That takes no courage at all. But people such as you and Mr. Wiesenburg are the ones who really carry the banner.” Former Mississippi Governor William Winter described Wiesenburg as "one of the most courageous men he ever knew."
While he did not attend college, unknown to his family until after his death, he paid for many students to attend colleges throughout the state. His family has established the Karl Wiesenburg Scholarship at the University of Southern Mississippi to honor his commitment to education and public service. The scholarship is available to University of Southern Mississippi students majoring in political science with preference for a student from Jackson County.

Narges Mohammadi

Narges Mohammadi (born 21 April 1972) is an Iranian human rights activist and the vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi.
Background.
Mohammadi was born in Zanjan, Iran. She attended Imam Khomeini International University, receiving a degree in physics, and became a professional engineer. During her university career, she wrote articles supporting women's rights in the student newspaper and was arrested at two meetings of the political student group Tashakkol Daaneshjooei Roshangaraan ("Illuminating Student Group"). She was also active in a mountain climbing group, but due to her political activities, was later banned from joining climbs.
She went on to work as a journalist for several reformist newspapers, and published a book of political essays titled "The reforms, the Strategy and the Tactics". In 2003, she joined the Defenders of Human Rights Center, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi; she later became the organization's vice president.
In 1999, she married to fellow pro-reform journalist Taghi Rahmani, who not long after was arrested for the first time. Rahmani moved to France in 2012 after serving a total of fourteen years of prison sentences, but Mohammadi remained to continue her human rights work. Mohammadi and Rahmani have twin children, Ali and Kiana.
Legal issues.
Mohammadi was first arrested in 1998 for her criticisms of the Iranian government and spent a year in prison. In April 2010, she was summoned to the Islamic Revolutionary Court for her membership in the DHRC. She was briefly released on US$50,000 bail but re-arrested several days later and detained at Evin prison. Mohammadi's health declined while in custody, and she developed an epilepsy-like disease causing her to periodically lose muscle control. After a month, she was released and allowed to go to the hospital.
In July 2011, Mohammadi was prosecuted again, and found guilty of "acting against the national security, membership of the DHRC and propaganda against the regime". In September she was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. Mohammadi stated that she had learned of the verdict only through her lawyers and had been "given an unprecedented 23-page judgment issued by the court in which they repeatedly likened my human rights activities to attempts to topple the regime". In March 2012, the sentence was upheld by an appeals court, though it was reduced to six years. On 26 April, she was arrested to begin her sentence.
The sentence was protested by the British Foreign Office, which called it "another sad example of the Iranian authorities' attempts to silence brave human rights defenders". Amnesty International designated her a prisoner of conscience and called for her immediate release. Reporters Without Borders issued an appeal on Mohammadi's behalf on the ninth anniversary of photographer's Zahra Kazemi death in Evin prison, stating that Mohammadi was a prisoner whose life was "in particular danger". In July 2012, an international group of lawmakers called for her release, including US Senator Mark Kirk, former Canadian Attorney General Irwin Cotler, UK MP Denis MacShane, Australian MP Michael Danby, Italian MP Fiamma Nirenstein, and Lithuanian MP Emanuelis Zingeris.
On July 31, 2012, Mohammadi has been released from prison.
Recognition.
In 2009, Mohammadi received the Alexander Langer Award, named for peace activist Alexander Langer. The award carried a 10,000 euro honorarium.

MT Vulcanus

M/T "Vulcanus, also known as Vulcanus I, Oragreen, Kotrando, and Erich Schröder", is a freighter first placed in service in 1956 that was used from 1972 to 1990 as an incinerator ship and later as a tanker.
History.
Launch and use as a freighter.
In 1955 the Richard Schröder shipping company of Hamburg ordered construction of a dry cargo freighter from Norderwerft Köser & Meyer, also of Hamburg. Built as hull number 818, the ship was launched on November 10, 1955, as the "Erich Schröder". After sea trials that began on December 29, 1955, the ship was delivered to the owners on January 17, 1956. It was built as a triple-superstructure ship with the machine room aft and the bridge amidships. It was equipped with three cargo hatches and loading equipment consisting of one 25-metric ton derrick and ten 5-metric ton derricks. In August 1962, the ship was transferred to the Richard Schröder K.G. shipping company, and in February 1972 sold to Ocean Combustion Service N. V. in Rotterdam.
Use as an incinerator ship.
Beginning on February 11, 1972, the new owner had the ship converted into a waste incinerator ship at the K. A. van Brink shipyard in Rotterdam. Tanks for transportation of the waste were added, plus two incinerators located aft, in which the waste would be combusted at temperatures between 1300 and 1400° Celsius. On September 15, 1972, the shipyard delivered the completed ship to Vulcanus Shipping Pte. Ltd. in Singapore, which placed it in service as the "Vulcanus". Management of the ship remained with Ocean Combustion Service; it was operated by Hansa Steamship Company of Bremen (Ocean Combustion Service and Vulcanus Shipping both being subsidiaries of Hansa). It was capable of incinerating 400–500 metric tons of waste a day, or approximately 100,000 metric tons a year. The ship primarily operated in the North Sea out of Rotterdam; in 1980 it and other incinerator ships were burning an estimated 80,000 metric tons of wastes including TCDD in the North Sea; but was also used on other routes. For example, in 1974, Shell Oil contracted to have liquid chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes from its Shell Chemical subsidiary incinerated in the Gulf of Mexico, and in 1977 in the South Pacific, "Vulcanus" disposed of more than 8 million liters of Agent Orange left over from the Vietnam War, in the U.S. Air Force Operation Pacer HO.
Following Hansa's declaration of bankruptcy on August 18, 1980, the "Vulcanus" continued to operate until 1983, when it was overhauled at the Jurong shipyard in Singapore and equipped with a totally new forecastle equipping it to transport chemical waste. On May 4, 1983, the old forecastle was scrapped at Lien Ho Hsing Steel Enterprise Company in Kaohsiung. The rebuilt ship was again placed in service as an incinerator vessel, now under the name "Vulcanus I". At the beginning of 1988, Waste Management, Inc., which had bought "Vulcanus I" and was then operating it and another incinerator ship named "Vulcanus II", withdrew a longstanding application to provide offshore incineration of toxic wastes to the US market. Growing protests by environmental groups led to a decision by the Third International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea in 1990 to ban waste incineration in the North Sea from December 31, 1991. The decision was ratified on June 23, 1990, by the OSPAR Commission. "Vulcanus I" was then sold that year to the Danish shipping company M.H. Simonsen A.p.S. in Svendborg.
Later career.
In 1990, Simonsen registered the ship with Simonsen Tankers Ltd. of Nassau, Bahamas, as the "Oragreen", and had it converted into a bunkering tanker. It remained with Simonsen until May 3, 2004, when it was transferred in Dakar, Senegal, to the Nigerian shipping company Kotram Nigeria Ltd. of Apapa. it remains registered with Kotram as the "Kotrando".

Rücklin (2011), regards "M. occitanus" as the sister taxon of "Rhinosteus". During the Frasnian, "M. occitanus" lived off the coast of an island continent, "Armorica," which consisted of portions of what would become Southern France.
Etymology.
The generic name literally translates as "black bone," the color referring to the translation of Montagne Noire, or "Black Mountains." The specific name refers to Occitania, the region of Southern France where the fossils were found.

Bulgaria's PM Boyko Borisov and the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso inaugurated the new section of the Sofia Metro, which was funded with EU money. Barroso expressed his delight that the metro station was named after the European Union.
History.
As the Sofia underground network was planned in the late 1970s, the station, along with the NDK Metro Station, was originally built in the early 1980s, along with the building of the National Palace of Culture. The original project name of the station was "Hemus" (the name of the large hotel next to the station); during the building of Line 2 of the Sofia Metro, it was planned to be called "Sveti Naum" (as it is located at the intersection of the Cherni Vrah and Sv. Naum boulevards). Shortly before the opening of the station, the city council (dominated by the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria party) controversially voted to change the name to "European Union". As the timing was so close to the opening of Line 2, many of the maps in the trains still retained the name "St. Naum" even after station was opened to the public.

Knyaginya Maria Luiza Metro Station

Knyaginya Maria Luiza Metro Station () is the 21st station to open on the Sofia Metro in Bulgaria. It is situated near the road junction Nadezhda in the northern part of Sofia, at the intersection of Maria Luiza Boulevard and Gen. Stoletov Blvd. It was put into operation on August 31, 2012 and is also known as the fifth station on the second BLUE line of the metro (station 5-II). It was also the first station on the path of the TBM, which worked on the section between stations 5-II and 9-II (part of phase I of the metro extension project), entirely constructed by the Turkish company Doğuş Construction, part of Doğuş Holding. The station is a shallow triple-span station with two rows of concrete and steel columns. It serves two central tracks and two side platforms. There are four street entrances, two on each side of the boulevard, after which the station is named. They lead to a central vestibule, right above the station.

Location.
The station is located at 116 Maria Luiza Blvd., Sofia, Bulgaria. As development to the north is limited due to the ground-level mainline railway service passing east to west, this station serves mostly areas located to its south. It serves mainly the residential district Banishora.

Naming.
Initially, in the project the station was named Banishora for the neighbourhood it serves. Afterwards, the official name was chosen to be in honour of Maria Luiza, Princess consort of Bulgaria, as one of four stations constructed under Maria Luiza Blvd. in Sofia, the other three being Central Railway Station, Lavov most, and Serdika II.
Construction.
Construction began as part of phase I of the Sofia Metro Extension Project, funded by the ERDF under Priority Axis 3 of OP Transport 2007-2013, Improvement of Intermodality for Passenger and Freight, and the National Budget in the amount of € 185,190,000. Phase I consisted in the construction of 4 stations and interconnecting tunnels and the inclusion of two stations built in the 1980s, plus another newly built station with national funding only.
The TBM boring began a few hundred meters to the north-west of the station on April 6, 2010. It was decided to bore a single tunnel with a double track with a diameter of 9,4 meters which called for high ceiling stations for the TBM to pass through. Maria Luiza Station was the first station on its path and the TBM reached the station in the first week of October, 2010. By the end of November, 2010 the station was constructively entirely completed. By 21 May 2012 the station was fully completed.
The station is a two-level underground station with the tracks and platforms on the lower level and a vestibule with turnstile gates and pedestrian underpasses on the upper level. It is a triple-span station with two rows of columns, one on each side-platform. Both tracks run in the center and are powered by a third rail +825V. The platforms are 104 meters long. The station is accessible by elevators on all levels from all four entrances at ground level. Escalators are installed on all levels (including ground level) for ease of access going upwards. The main colours of the station are pale green and beige. The architectural project is credited to the Turkish company Doğuş Construction, part of Doğuş Holding.
The station was inaugurated as part of a grand opening ceremony for the inauguration of the entire second BLUE line on 31 August 2012 in the presence of Bulgaria's PM Boyko Borisov and the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso.

2012 Samar earthquake

An earthquake off the coast of Samar occurred on August 31, 2012, at 20:47 local time (12:47 UTC) in the Philippines. The populated islands of Visayas were struck by an earthquake of magnitude Mw 7.6. The earthquake has a depth of 34.9 km (21.7 miles). A tsunami warning was announced within the Pacific area and was later lifted after two hours. The Philippine archipelago is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.
Geology.
The Philippine Mobile Belt is between the Eurasia Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Philippine Sea Plate is subducting along the Philippine Trench in this region. At the latitude of the earthquake, the Philippine Sea Plate moves in the WNW direction at a velocity of approximately 100 mm/yr with respect to the Sunda Plate.
This earthquake was an intraplate earthquake greater than 50 kilometers to the east of the boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate. This earthquake was unusual in that it occurred as a result of reverse faulting within the oceanic lithosphere of the Philippine Sea Plate. There have been approximately 40 events of M6 and above over the past 40 years, within 250 km of this earthquake. Most of those earthquakes were the result of normal faulting within the shallower oceanic lithosphere rather than deeper reverse faulting like this event.
Earthquake.
After the initial earthquake, the power supply was cut off in affected areas after power lines were damaged. Power plants in Visayas tripped or shut down following the earthquake, although no major damage was sustained in transmission facilities.
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that a house in Agusan del Sur province caught fire sparked by a gas lamp that was toppled during the earthquake. It also reported that two bridges in Eastern Samar, particularly the Buyayawan Bridge in Mercedes town and the Barangay Casuroy Bridge in San Julian town, were partially damaged. The Abreeza Mall in Bajada, Davao City suffered minor cracks on the floor due to the earthquake.
A house in the southern city of Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao, was involved in a landslide along with several other homes, killing one of its inhabitants and hospitalizing another.
In General MacArthur, Eastern Samar, 77 homes were damaged. There were also 6 houses damaged in Barangay Casoroy, San Julian. A wall from an old building collapsed in Butuan City.
The NDRRMC reported on Saturday noon there were cracks on some roads and bridges and other establishments in areas where the quake was felt. Most of the homes destroyed were those made of light materials, while overall damage to infrastructure remained minimal.
Tsunami.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) gave a level three tsunami alert in the Philippines and Other institutes gave a level three tsunami alert in Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, Palau indicating that the public should be on watch for "unusual waves", but did not call for any evacuation. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center rapidly issued tsunami warning in the Pacific together with its adjacent islands. However, it was lifted after two hours as no tsunami was recorded. In Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warning throughout the coastal areas of the country. The Hong Kong Observatory also issued tsunami warning on Hong Kong on that same time.
About an hour after the quake, sea level readings from gauges in the epicentral region confirmed that a tsunami had been generated. A small 3 cm (1.2 in) wave was recorded at Legazpi in Albay province shortly thereafter, as well as further south near Davao City; slight sea level anomalies were observed in several other locations.
Response.
Based on preliminary estimates of the magnitude, specialists noted that a significant tsunami could have been generated. A tsunami warning was issued within 8 minutes after the tremor for coastal regions of the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Guam, and Japan, as well as for the island nations of Palau, Yap, and Northern Mariana. A tsunami watch was at the time in effect for much of Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Hawaii, and the Pacific coast of Russia. Most of the warnings and watches were quickly cancelled following revisions to the earthquake's intensity, although the warnings for the Philippines, Indonesia and Palau remained in effect.
The tremor caused widespread panic in Eastern Visayas, where many inhabitants exited their homes. At the risk of destructive waves, officials in the Philippines urged remaining residents of eastern coastal areas to evacuate to higher ground.

New Caledonian barn owl

The New Caledonian Barn Owl ("Tyto letocarti"), also referred to as Letocart's Barn Owl, is an extinct species of owl in the barn owl family. It was endemic to the island of New Caledonia in Melanesia in the south-west Pacific region. It was described from subfossil bones found at the Gilles Cave paleontological site on the west coast of Grande Terre. The holotype is a complete adult left femur (NCG 1000), held by the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. The owl was described as "Tyto? letocarti", indicating uncertainty as to generic placement at the time. The specific epithet honours Yves Letocart, of New Caledonia’s Water and Forest Service, who was active in bird conservation and paleontological work on the island.

Braunosteus

Braunosteus schmidti is a medium sized selenosteid arthrodire placoderm known from the Upper Frasnian Kellwasserkalk facies of Late Devonian Bad Wildungen, Germany. "B. schmidti" has a broad skull about 9 centimeters long, and a short, but pointed rostrum. Its appearance is very similar to that of the basal selenosteid "Pachyosteus".
It was originally placed within a monotypic family, "Braunosteidae," by Erik Stensiö in 1959. Obruchev (1964) and Miles (1969) placed it within the Trematosteidae due to the presence of a postpineal fenestra. Denison (1978) has "B. schmidti" placed within Selenosteidae, noting that other arthrodires in addition to trematosteids have postpineal fenestrae, as well as similar anatomy of the orbital and suborbital plates, and that its scapulo-coracoid bone is largely identical to those of "Pachyosteus" and "Enseosteus".

My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1)

My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1) is the tenth studio album by American R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige, released on November 21, 2011, by Geffen Records and Matriarch Records. Titled as the sequel and serving as a thematical extension to her 1994 breakthrough album "My Life", which portrayed a dark period in Blige's personal life, it talks about the themes of struggle, heartbreak, and strength while reflecting the growth and evolution she had experienced since the release of its predecessor.
Production for the album took place during 2010 to 2011 at several recording studios in New York and Los Angeles and was handled by Danja, Eric Hudson, Rodney Jerkins, Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Harmony Samuels, StarGate, Tricky Stewart, The Underdogs, and Jerry Wonda. Upon its release, "My Life II" received generally positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number five on the US "Billboard" 200 chart with first weeks sales of 156,000 copies. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and became the best-selling R&B album of 2012. From the four singles that were released, only "Mr. Wrong" achieved chart success, reaching the top ten of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Background.
In December 2009, Blige's ninth studio album, "Stronger with Each Tear", was released, debuting at number two on the "Billboard" 200 and at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 332,000 units in its first week of release. It became her ninth consecutive studio album to have debuted at the top of the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and won Blige the award for Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Album at the 41st NAACP Image Awards. By August 2010, Blige had already begun work on her tenth studio album with Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, The Underdogs, Jerry Wonda, Arden Altino, Lil Ronnie, Jay-Z, Timbaland, Salaam Remi, Maxwell, Alicia Keys, Raphael Saadiq, Ester Dean, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Johnta Austin, Eric Hudson, Q-Tip, Sean Garrett, DJ Premier, Gorilla Tek, Don Pooh, Ne-Yo, and Drumma Boy. First reports claimed the album would be titled "LovHer" and was due for release in the first quarter of 2011, thought Blige later revealed during her Music Saved My Life Tour, that she was in no rush to release the album and she had not given it a title yet. A song called "Anything You Want" featuring Busta Rhymes and Gyptian leaked on line in August 2010.
Backstage at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, when speaking of approach to the new album, Blige described crafting sonic heat similar to her first two studio albums but plan to update the vintage Blige sound, telling that “will be more like a "What's the 411?" of 2012. It's headed that direction but in a new [way. Not what it used to be. Right now, it's going in the "Mary" direction, which is R&B and hip-hop and soul. If it goes into the club direction, it will probably be more soulful than futuristic." On June 21, 2011, a track titled "Feel Inside" apparently featuring Nicki Minaj leaked online. In an interview with MTV it was revealed that the track was in fact two separate songs that the duo were respectively working on, but that someone had put together. Blige revealed that despite the fake collaboration, Minaj and Blige would be collaborating on a song. "I was ****ed about the leaking of the Nicki Minaj and Mary J Blige record, because that's not fair and people shouldn't do that [...] But I'm over it. We move on. We're going to make more hot music." 
In terms of what she wanted to achieve musically with the album, Blige herself told Blues & Soul: "With so much techno and four-to-the floor and general loss of live instrumentation going on today, to me people are not doing real MUSIC any more. And so with this album I really wanted people to remember when music was about QUALITY instead of QUANTITY!... I basically wanted to separate myself and give everybody back what I feel music today is MISSING." Finished in Los Angeles, New York City and Atlanta, "My Life II" sees Blige looking toward the future while acknowledging the past: "From me to you, My Life II… Our journey together continues in this life,”" explained Mary. "“It’s a gift to be able to relate and identify with my fans at all times. This album is a reflection of the times and lives of people all around me.”

Originally scheduled for a September 20, 2011 release, the album was later pushed back to November 21, 2011. A deluxe edition for the album will also be available only in the United States.

Critical response.
"My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1)" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 15 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Martyn Young of musicOMH called it "a wonderfully assured collection of classy RnB pop that can justifiably rank amongst her best work", and commented that its ballads "are never grandiose or overblown and Blige’s perfectly poised vocals are genuinely affecting." BBC Music's Lloyd Bradley dubbed the album "Blige's most enjoyable, exciting and consistent album in years" and complimented its music as a "clever updating" of her past hip hop soul. "The Daily Telegraph" stated, "with the right collaborators can conjure golden moments when the listener is transported simultaneously to the church pew and the dancefloor." "Rolling Stone" writer Jody Rosen called Blige "admirably unfashionable, staying in her sweet spot of midtempo hip-hop soul", adding that "she can still make pain pleasurable."
However, Andy Gill of "The Independent" was ambivalent towards its "bumpy emotional terrain", adding that "by the time she's berating some partner for not listening to her, your sympathies wane." Kevin Ritchie of "NOW" panned the album's "easy-listening ballads" and characterized Blige's direction as "dull and predictable". "Entertainment Weekly"s Adam Markovitz commented that "Blige can still rip your heart out with a note", but criticized "the lovelorn lyrics" and "'modern' touches". Rebecca Nicholson of "The Guardian" called it "a surprisingly robust return to form [...] elegant, refined and, for the most, part up-to-date", but also found it "far too long" and criticized the "listlessness and sentimentality" of its ballads. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson disliked Blige's "lapses into self-pity", but commended the "slow burn" of the album's second-half as "her most credible adult-contemporary music since 1999's "Mary"." Allmusic editor Andy Kellman stated, "Those who are hoping for something in the spirit of mid-'90s Blige might be disappointed and think of the title as a ploy, but those who expect a wide variety of material in terms of style and mood will get precisely that."
"Los Angeles Times" writer Mikael Wood stated, "She gets away with the dramatics because she makes them so easy to buy: No working soul singer depicts struggle (and its hard-won defeat) more believably than Blige does, even when armed with so-so material, as she often is here." Although he found its ballads "a little toothless", Evan Rytlewski of "The A.V. Club" stated, "What "My Life II" lacks in a single vision, though, it makes up for with consistently rousing performances from Blige, whose radiant voice has only grown fuller and bluesier with time." Peter S. Scholtes of "Spin" complimented the "funky, mid-tempo beauties such as 'Irreversible,' 'Midnight Drive,' and 'Someone to Love Me (Naked)'" and stated, "Amid overwrought theatrical gestures, MJB still finds a slinky groove". David Masciotra of PopMatters commented that "despite its flaws, is an immensely enjoyable and impressive album", commending its "four song, mid-album set of soulful R&B" and "closing trio of ballads".

Pachyosteus

Pachyosteus bulla is a medium sized selenosteid arthrodire placoderm known from the Upper Frasnian Kellwasserkalk facies of Late Devonian Bad Wildungen, Germany and from the Famennian portions of the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland. "P. bulla" has a broad skull about 7 to 10 centimeters long, a comparatively long median dorsal plate, and a short rostral plate that meets the pineal plate. In his cladogram, Rücklin (2011) regards "P. bulla" as a basal selenosteid, being the sister taxon of the American genera, and the Kellwasserkalk genera of Germany and Morocco.

My Only Rescue

My Only Rescue is the second studio album by Christian Contemporary-Pop-Rock band The Museum. It was released on August 28, 2012 through BEC Recordings. The album was produced by Pete Kipley.
The first radio single was "Love Will Find You" that charted at No. 29 on the "Billboard" Christian AC Indicator songs chart.
Background.
Recorded.
The album was recorded at the following studios: The Bomb Shelter in Brentwood, Tennessee and Be Brilliant in Franklin, Tennessee.
Response.
Critical.
"CCM Magazine"'s Matt Conner said the album is "easily the most polished, mature release from the band to date."
The Christian Manifesto's Calvin Moore said "overall, "My Only Rescue" is a decent enough progression in the life of a respectable band, but its relatively unremarkable. There are some genuinely impressive moments on the project as well as some spots that could have used some polishing. Longtime fans will herald The Museum’s new offering. As for me, I’d recommend downloading various singles, but not the entire project."
Christian Music Zine's Joshua Andre said ""My Only Rescue" is sadly near the bottom of my ‘pile’ in terms of favourite albums. Nevertheless the band does serve up some God orchestrated moments." In addition, Andre wrote "The Museum’s sophomore album is a bit of a mixed bag, with top notch worship songs, alongside standard CCM pop radio friendly tracks, and tracks which try to fit in way too many genres and at first glance seems confusing and directionless. Yet, if you ask me to review this album in 3 months or so, I’ll probably rate it higher. I don’t know. All I know is that The Museum have tried very hard for their sophomore album, and with some success (“In Jesus Name”, “Not For Sale”, “Love will find You”, “My Only Rescue”), with some room for improvement needed in a few songs (“All Over The World”, “Lost In a Moment”). Don’t chuck out the baby with the bath water though- keep The Museum in your sights- they do have potential, and here’s to hoping album #3 is a little bit more cohesive."
"Christianity Today"s Andy Argyrakis said that the band was "named after a monument that marked the end of communism in Romania, The Museum continues to dive deeply social issues. Gleaned from activism with Compassion International and the anti-slavery organization Not for Sale, this album overflows with the pursuit of justice, while urging listeners to break out of comfort zones. There are hints of worship throughout, but it's all wrapped around massive power chords, escalating electronics, and arena-ready balladry."
Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre said "while this album has some good points (like the layered musical elements in ‘All Over the World’ and ‘Coming Closer’), this album fails to hit the marks of ‘originality’ and ‘creativeness’, with newer artists like Bellarive, An Epic No Less and One Sonic Society all impressing and exceeding The Museum, with their albums in 2012!" Furthermore, Andre wrote that "even though we fellow believers are fully confident about the band’s motives behind the album, The Museum have created a musical collection that is clever musically but sometimes slips into a ‘blurry’ mode that doesn’t necessarily work in their favour. With standout tracks ‘Love Will Find You’, ‘In Jesus Name’ and ‘Not For Sale’ highlights in an album that’s a certain purchase for fans of their first album, The Museum’s second album hasn’t really lived up to a more-than-2-year wait. If you’re looking for the contemporary/pop version of Hillsong, you have found it in The Museum!"
Jesus Freak Hideout's Ryan Barbee asked the question, "so how did The Museum do with this new release? It's not quite clear. At points the album features some of their best songs to date. But more often than not, the standard is compromised. "My Only Rescue" might not be the best follow up, but these guys are definitely not down for the count. Hopefully in the near future we will hear some more of those edgier sounds that captured listeners the first go-around."
Louder Than The Music's Jono Davies said that "sometimes when you put a CD on for the first time you have no idea what it's going to sound like. You either get the biggest treat in the world, or the worst treat in the world! With this new release from The Museum, thankfully it was a nice treat." Plus, Davies wrote that "the future is very bright for The Museum. I can easily see them touring round the country next year with other similar bands and doing well. With this album they haven't changed the face of Christian music, but what they have done is make it sound very good."
New Release Tuesday Jonathan Francesco said "with their sophomore effort, "My Only Rescue", the band seems to try and find themselves a bit more with a fairly varied mix of accessible tunes." Additionally, Francesco asked the question, "So does The Museum succeed in defining themselves with this release? I'd cautiously say, not yet. The music is very good and there are moments that feel inspired by other acts like Kutless or Tenth Avenue North, among others, but there's also little here that actually screams, "Ah, this is The Museum!" Hopefully in subsequent releases, The Museum can better define their own sound and create a record that fits in with everyone else's while still maintaining a distinct identity. But for now, the tracks here will offer some good radio contemporary pop/rock that will probably still find quite a bit of affection from the CCM crowd."

"I have been in the game for so long and still have the same passion I did when I first started. I want my fans to ride with me on this one and know that I am so focused on bringing good music to them," explained the veteran MC. "It's called Doggumentary Music because this is my life and I want to share my music, and my process of making it, with the fans."

The song is reportedly left over from the "Plastic Beach" sessions, in which Snoop collaborated on the track "Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach" Snoop said about the collaboration: "We did that record in London, England at their studio. The track made me wanna' sing & have fun & what not I don't give a f**k, it's like maybe I can smoke witchu' maybe I can't, you know what I'm saying?"

Dubbed "Puff Puff Pass Tuesdays," Snoop plans to release a new song each week starting January 11, 2011 (with song "El Lay"), until the release of his album.
Singles.
"New Year's Eve" was the first official promotional single released from "Doggumentary", it was released on November 5, 2010, on the iTunes Store. The track peaked on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 66. The song features American singer-songwriter Marty James and is produced by Scoop DeVille, producer of Snoop's 2009 single "I Wanna Rock". It did not however make the final cut of the album.
"Wet" the first official lead single from the album. The song was recorded specifically for Prince William's bachelor's party. Snoop's spokespeople bill the song as a sequel to 2007's "Sexual Eruption." Produced by the Cataracs of Far East Movement fame, Snoop spoke of the gift “When I heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of Prince William’s marriage, I knew I had to give them a little something." He continued, “’Wet’ is the perfect anthem for Prince William or any playa to get the club smokin’." The song was released on iTunes on December 17, 2010.

"He has a deep love for music, and sometimes he goes over the head of the people that's listening just like myself, because we're too in-depth with music. We don't just listen to our genre. We find ourselves enjoying all walks of music." The song, however, almost didn't make the final cut, as Snoop had finished up recording the album.

After sending his sketch to Kelly, the crooner replied with his own rough demo, leading the pair to finally complete the record.

Historical hydroculture

This is a history of notable hydroculture phenomena. Ancient hydroculture proposed sites, and modern revolutionary works are mentioned. Included in this history are all forms of aquatic and semi-aquatic based horticulture that focus on flora: aquatic gardening, semi-aquatic crop farming, hydroponics, aquaponics, passive hydroponics, and modern aeroponics.
Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
One of the wonders of the ancient world, was irrigated by the Euphrates River. It is uncertain if Sammu-ramat or Nebuchadrezzar II ordered them to be built between 8th and 7th century BC Babylonia. The gardens were built partially on top of ziggurats, and plants were irrigated on channels. No direct evidence of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon exists. However, there is archeological evidence, uncovered by Robert Koldewey, that ancient structures exist to support the technology used for these gardens. Ancient Greeks Diodorus Siculus and Strabo have noted the Hanging Babylonian Gardens.
Precolonial America.
A Chinampa is a floating garden armada in a lake from the Xochimilco region, once Chinampan, of Mexico. This floating garden, still in use, can have an area of up to 10 meters by 200 meters.
The agricultural output of the chinampa allowed the postclassic Aztec civilization to flourish.
Historical Orient.
Historically, fish have been raised within flooded rice fields in Indochina and China.
Living root bridges.
There are 500 year old bridges made by living roots in India, sculpted by the War-Khasis. These trees span rivers, and may be limited in connectivity to hydroculture.
Hydroculture found in nature.
Orchids are well known for their aerial roots.
Ōhi'a Lehua, Metrosideros polymorpha, is a Hawaiian plant with roots that can grow suspended in extinct lava tubes. The roots of this plant are able to penetrate deep into the volcanic rock, to reach these hollow tubes, where they can collect moisture.

Tafas

Tafas (, also spelled Tafs or Tuffas) is a town in southern Syria, administratively part of the Daraa Governorate, located north of Daraa. Nearby localities include al-Shaykh Saad and Nawa to the north, Da'el, Abtaa and al-Shaykh Maskin to the northeast, Saham al-Jawlan and Adwan to the northwest and Muzayrib to the south. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Tafas had a population of 32,236 in the 2004 census.
History.
Before the Hellenistic era, the goddess "Isis Lactans" "Weeping Isis" was worshipped in Tafas, as evidenced by the discovery of statuette of her in the town. During the Roman era in Syria, a Jewish community existed in Tafas. Several funerary stelae, the earliest dating to 64 BCE, were found in Tafas. A bronze "patera" from the Roman era was also found, but it was later stolen from the Mohammedan Museum of Damascus.
Ottoman.
In 1596, Tafas appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the "nahiya" of Bani Malik al-Asraf in the "Qada Hawran". It had a population of 73 households and 40 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and beehives. The first elementary school in the village was introduced in 1865. In the 1880s, Tafas was described as a moderate-sized village of around 100 stone-built houses inhabited by around 250 Muslims. Some of the houses were in ruins and not inhabited. There was an active Friday mosque. A decade later, it was described as having 90 houses and 400 inhabitants.
In 1918, the town was the site of an infamous massacre perpetrated by the retreating Ottoman Army during World War I. According to T.E. Lawrence, on 27 September retreating Turkish troops had slaughtered many of the town's inhabitants, including women and children. In retaliation for the massacre, Lawrence's troops attacked the retreating Turkish columns and ordered all captured prisoners, around 250, including German and Austrian soldiers, to be executed.
Modern.
During the ongoing Syrian uprising, inhabitants of Tafas joined the demonstrations burning a police station and the local Ba'ath Party headquarters, three people were killed by security forces. In May 2011, the Syrian Army besieged the town, and arrested at least 250 people there.
Archaeology.
There was a square tower, known as a "medany", with an elevation of 50 feet and a width of 10 feet with a square-shaped base. It consisted of two floors, each having a window. The tower was attached to a Friday mosque measuring 46 feet by 41 feet. On its western side were terrace-like steps leading to the mosque's roof, which was supported by three rows of columns, each row consisting of four columns, the shafts of which had a height of 5 feet. The entire column stood at 9 feet 5 inches. In each row, the two center columns stood out independently while the first and last columns were built into the wall. Together with the arches the total height of the mosque's interior space was nearly 16 feet. The mosque was largely constructed sometime during the Islamic era, although there were some architectural elements dating to the Roman or Byzantine era.

Rollins. The factory was built on farmland owned by Dyer. B.F. Ingalls served as the architect and builder. The factory opened officially on November 15, 1870. The machines used in the factory were imported from Germany. The building was located along the Alvarado Creek, for transportation purposes, since there weren't any railroads. Sugar was distributed via a wheel steamer named "The Rosa," to San Francisco from the factory. In the first year of production it processed 293 tons of beet sugar. In 1873 the factory closed due to financial reasons. The equipment was sold to another plant in Soquel, California. The original building was demolished. Imperial Sugar bought Holly Sugar Company in 1988.

Jacques Laskar

Jacques Laskar (born 28 April 1955 in Paris) is a French astronomer. He is a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and a member of "Astronomy and dynamical systems" of the Institute of Celestial Mechanics and Computing Ephemerides (IMCCE) of the Paris Observatory. He received the CNRS Silver medal in 1994. Since 2003, he is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.
Teaching career.
After graduation, Laskar taught high school and colleges from 1977 to 1980 at the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan. Then, he taught aggregation mathematics in 1981 and a year later, he taught astronomy and celestial mechanics. He then joined Bureau des Longitudes as a research officer second class of CNRS in 1985.
Research work.
Stability of the Solar System.
In 1989, Laskar provided evidence that the Solar System is chaotic instead of quasi-periodic as originally determined by Laplace and Lagrange. More specifically, his estimate of the maximum Lyapunov exponent measuring the exponential divergence of two nearby orbits is formula_1, meaning that it is possible to predict the trajectories of the Solar System over 10 Myr but fundamentally impossible over more than 100 Myr. This chaoticity comes mainly from the inner planets Mercury, Venus the Earth and Mars.
In 2009, he and his colleague Mickeal Gastineau generated numeric simulations of orbital instability over the next five billion years. Unlike previous models, they took into account Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. Over a short time span, this made little difference, but over the long haul it resulted in dramatically different orbital paths. The researchers looked at 2501 possible scenarios, 25 of which ended with a severely disrupted solar system.
Chaotic obliquity of the planets.
Laskar also contributed to the study of the evolution of the skew planets of the solar system. One can for example include his work on retrograde rotation of Venus. With his colleague Alexandre Correla, at Astronomie et Systemes Dynamiques of Paris, he found out that the atmosphere may simply have slowed the planet down and then started it spinning the other way. This insidious process would have been the unique result of the thick atmosphere always lagging behind as the planet rotates.
Paleoclimates.
He has contributed to the astronomical theory of paleoclimates, studying the orbits of the planets and the obliquity of the solar system allowing it to link with the study of climate on geological time scales

Travis Rodgers

Travis Rodgers is a sports talk radio personality. Currently he is the host of the Yahoo! Sports Radio program, "Travis Rodgers Now" and the KLAA 830 AM program "The Travis Rodgers Morning Show". Prior to hosting his own shows, he was the producer of the nationally syndicated Jim Rome Show and the ESPN television show Jim Rome is Burning.
Early life.
Travis Rodgers grew up in Arcadia, California. He graduated from Arcadia High School. He attended University of California, Santa Barbara, where he graduated with a BS in Political Science. He pitched for the UCSB baseball team for four seasons.
Radio career.
Rodgers was hired to work for the Los Angeles radio show "The Jim Rome Show", becoming the producer in 1996. Through the efforts of Rome and Rodgers working together, they were able to syndicate the program, eventually reaching more than 200 affiliates in the United States and Canada. After leaving the show in 2009, he was hired in 2010 by KGOW 1560 AM, in Houston. At the beginning of 2011, he added a national program with Sporting News Radio which became Yahoo Sports Radio in September of that year, and was voted Best Sport Talk Host of 2011 by the Houston Press.
In 2012, Rodgers moved his program to KLAA 830 and began "The Travis Rodgers Morning Show", based in Anaheim, California, and soon after KGOW dropped his local Houston program. Rodgers maintains his Yahoo! Sports Radio show as well as his local KLAA programming from 6–9 am PT, (his first national broadcast hour is also carried on KLAA from 9–10am PT). Rodgers's local program is advertised as "the only live, local morning sports show in the Los Angeles market".
In reference to his current time slot: "I can’t wait to go against the show that I helped build in to the industry standard . . . . It's not that anymore, and I look forward to creating the new standard in Sports Talk radio."
"I like blue shirts" -Travis Rodgers
"Why yes, I'll take another burrito" - Travis Rodgers
"I'd like to report a penalty."
Travis Rodgers Now.
Rodgers considers his new show a blend of pop culture and sports, in that order. Rodgers varies from the normal sports talk format in several ways.
Rodgers prefers to use Twitter over traditional phone calls or emails; he encourages listeners to tweet the show to comment on the issues of the day, and reads tweets he finds interesting, insightful, or funny. Travis spends a lot of time during the show interacting with his Twitter followers and has a dozen or so that he especially enjoys interacting with including: ATXHoboGirl, DarbintheOC, Duncanstein, IshInMemphis, WalkoffHBP, Brian Beckner, SurlySaltine, Ryan in Laguna Beach, RomSho, Francis Pablo, DeathbySexy & Jon from Fullerton.
One of Rodgers's regular guests is his friend Brian Beckner; he joins The show for a weekly segment or two entitled "The Friday Facts." Rodgers has stated on the air that his conversations with Beckner are a highlight of the show.
"Travis Rodgers Now" is podcast at Yahoo! Sports Radio Podcasts, along with the other YSR shows. The national show can be streamed Yahoo! Sports Radio from Noon to 2pm ET.
Beginning in 2012, Rodgers held his Big Fan Bracket tournament, in which he pitted all the things of which he considered himself a "big fan:" mostly, but not exclusively, models and actresses. The first winner was Dominique Sachse.

Kedareshwara Temple, Halebidu

Kedareshwara Temple (also spelt "Kedaresvara" or "Kedareshvara") is a Hoysala era construction in the historically important town of Halebidu, in the Hassan district of Karnataka state, India. It is located a short distance away from the famous Hoysaleswara Temple. The temple was constructed by Hoysala King Veera Ballala II (r. 1173-1220 A.D.) and his queen Ketaladevi, and the main deity is "Ishwara" (another name for the Hindu god Shiva). The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.
Temple plan.
According to art historian Adam Hardy, the temple was constructed before 1219 A.D and is constructed with Soap stone. The usage of Soap stone was first popularized by the Western Chalukyas before it became standard with the Hoysala architects of the 12th and 13th centuries. The temple stands on the platform called "jagati" which is typically five to six feet in height and which can be reached by a flight of steps. According to historian Kamath, this is a Hoysala innovation. Hoysala temples normally don't provide a path for circumambulation ("pradakshinapatha") around the inner sanctum ("garbhagriha"). However, the platform provides this convenience in addition to giving the onlooker a good view of the wall relief and sculptures. The outlay of the main shrine ("Vimana") is star shaped (stellate) with two smaller shrines that have perforated windows (called "Jali", literally, "sieve") on the sides. According to the art historian Gerard Foekema, star shaped or "staggered square" (or cross in square) temple plans are quiet common among Hoysala constructions creating multiple projections and recesses in the outer walls. In these projections, the Hoysala architects created repetitive decorative sculptures and reliefs called "architectural articulation".
Since the temple has three shrines, it qualifies as a "trikuta", a three shrined structure. Often in "trikutas", only the central shrine has a tower while the lateral shrines are virtually hidden behind the thick outer walls and appear to be a part of the hall itself. Despite being a Shaiva temple (related to god Shiva) it is well known for its friezes and panel relief that bare depictions from both the Shaiva and Vaishnava (related to the god Vishnu) legend. The three sanctums are connected to a "staggered square" (indented) central hall ("mahamantapa") by individual vestibules called "sukanasi". A porch connects the central hall to the platform. The base of the temple wall ("adhisthana") around the common hall and the two lateral shrines consist of moldings, each of which is treated with friezes in relief that depict animals and episodes from the Hindu lore ("purana"). Historian Kamath calls this "horizontal treatment". The image of the deity of worship is missing in all three sanctums and the superstructure over all three shrines are lost. Some noteworthy pieces of sculpture worty of mention are the dancing Bhairava (a form of Shiva), Govardhana (the god Krishna lifting a mountain), the god Vishnu as "Varadaraja", and a huntress.

Khan Dannun

Khan Dannun (, also spelled Khan Danun, Khan Dunnun or Khan Dhul-Nun) is a town in southern Syria, administratively part of the Markaz Rif Dimashq District of the Rif Dimashq Governorate. Located south of Damascus, nearby localities include al-Taybah to the west, Muqaylibah to the northwest, al-Kiswah 5 kilometers to the north and Khiyarat Dannun to the east. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Khan Dannun had a population of 8,727 in the 2004 census.
Khan Dannun also contains a refugee camp with the same name and is one of ten Palestinian refugee camps in Syria recognized by UNRWA. According to UNRWA statistics the camp had a population of 7,841 in 1998. According to UNRWA the population of the camp in June 2008 was 9,479 persons and 2,192 families.
History.
Khan Dannun was originally a large "khan" ("caravansary") completed in 1376 by the Mamluk governor of Damascus, Manjak al-Yusufi, during the reign of the Bahri Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban. The "khan" was designed by Ali ibn al-Badri, known as "muhandis ash-Sham" ("engineer of Damascus.") The name "Dan nun" is the colloquial version of "Dhul-Nun," a highly venerated 9th-century Muslim figure. He is considered to be the early patriarch of the Sufis. Khan Dannun became a stopping point on the "hajj" ("pilgrimage to Mecca") caravan route after al-Kiswah, and before Ghabaghib.
The "khan", with exception of its vaults, was built in the traditional basalt masonry typically found in the old structures in Hauran. It consisted of an open, square-shaped courtyard, the center of which had been occupied by livestock. Surrounding the courtyard were arcades built atop lodging apartments which served as accommodation for visitors. The courtyard was flanked by circular basalt towers. Inside the khan was a small prayer room with "mihrab" niche which indicated the direction of Mecca. A marsh was formed in front of the "khan's" gate as a result of an eastern-flowing rivulet.
When traveler John Lewis Burckhardt visited the site in the early 19th-century, the "khan" was in ruins. Khan Dannun was one of the stops on the Damascus-Hauran line of the Hejaz Railway.
In 1949, following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a Palestinian refugee camp called Khan Dannun was set up in the town. In 2009 a new sewage project for Khan Dannun, funded by the European Commission, was finished.

Race and ethnicity in censuses

Many countries and national censuses currently enumerate or have previously enumerated their populations by race, ethnicity, nationality, or a combination of these characteristics. Different countries have different classifications and census options for race and ethnicity/nationality which are not comparable with data from other countries. In addition, many of the race and ethnicity concepts that appear on national censuses worldwide have their origins in Europe or in the views of Europeans, rather than in the views of the locals of these countries. The concept of race has no scientific basis, but distinctive sociocultural communities are important in some national contexts, as social facts.
Abkhazia.
People in Abkhazia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, the partially recognized state of Abkhazia also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 2003 and 2011.
Afghanistan.
Prior to 2010, Afghanistan had not held a census since 1979 due to the wars and conflicts that have occurred there over those three decades (since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979).
Albania.
Albania enumerated people by ethnicity in 1955, 1989, and 2011. The 2011 Albanian census also enumerated people by language used and by their religious beliefs.
Algeria.
Algeria enumerated people by ethnicity in 1960.
Angola.
The Portuguese asked about race in colonial censuses when they controlled Angola, and they provided three options: White, Mestizo, or African/Black. Africans had to then pick either "Assimilado" (assimilated) or "Indigenato" (indigenous). Angola has not used any racial categories since its independence in 1975. Tribe and language for Africans were recorded only in 1950 and 1960.
Argentina.
Argentina enumerated its population by their country of birth from 1869 to the present day.
Armenia.
People in Armenia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Armenia also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 2001 and 2011.
Australia.
Australia enumerated its population by race between 1911 to 1966, by "racial origin" in 1971 and 1976, and by (ethnic) origin since 1981.
Azerbaijan.
People in Azerbaijan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Azerbaijan also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 1999 and 2009.
Bahamas.
The population of the Bahamas was enumerated by ethnicity in 1953.
Bahrain.
Bahrain enumerated people by ethnicity in 1965 and 2010. The 2010 Bahrain census also enumerated people by their religious beliefs.

Barbados.
The population of Barbados was enumerated by ethnicity in 1946, 1960, 1970, and 1980.
Belarus.
People in Belarus (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Belarus also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 1999 and 2009.
Belize.
Back when Belize was British Honduras, it enumerated people by ethnicity in 1946. Since gaining independence, Belize has enumerated people by ethnicity from 1980 all the way up to its most recent census in 2010.
Benin.
The people in Benin were enumerated by ethnicity in 1979 and 1992.
Bermuda.
The people of Bermuda were enumerated by ethnicity since at least 1950 all the way up to the present day.
Bolivia.
Bolivia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1950, 2001, and 2012. The 2012 census included 40 ethnic group options. However, it did not include Mestizo as an option, which critics of current Bolivian President Evo Morales say was because he wants more Bolivians to identify as one of the indigenous groups in order to lend more legitimacy to his indigenous-friendly policies.
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The population of Bosnia and Herzegovina was enumerated by ethnicity since at least 1885 all the way up to the most recent census in 1991.
Botswana.
Botswana enumerated people by race in all censuses between 1904 and 1946, and again in the 1964 census (though not in 1956), but in no censuses after 1964. People were enumerated by language use in 1946 and 1956 and again in 2001.
Brazil.
The Brazilian census enumerated people by race in all censuses since 1872 with the exception of 1900, 1920, and 1970. The Brazilian census classifies people by race as either white, black, pardo (brown), yellow (Asian), or indigenous.
Brunei.
Since 1945, Brunei enumerated people by ethnicity in all censuses since 1947.
Bulgaria.
Bulgaria enumerated people by mother tongue in 1880 and 1887 and used this info to determine their ethnicities. Bulgaria directly enumerated people by ethnicity from 1900 all the way up to its most recent census in 2011, with the exception of the 1985 census.
Burma.
The people in Burma (also known as Myanmar) were enumerated by ethnicity in 1931, and 1953. A new census which plans to enumerate the people of Burma by ethnicity and race is planned to be held in 2014. The 1931 Burmese census generated a lot of anger from non-Burmese ethnic groups who were marked as Burmese on the census. There is hope that the scheduled 2014 Burma Census will help empower the various ethnic groups in Burma.
Canada.
Canada counted people by ethnic origin in 1765 and again from at least 1871 to 2006, with the exception of 1891. The options for ethnicity in the 2006 Canadian census were White, Chinese, South Asian, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab, West Asian, Korean, Japanese, and Other. The 2011 Canadian census did not ask about race and ethnicity, but the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS) for that year did ask about race and ethnicity (as well as many other questions that were previously asked on the Canadian census). Prior to the 1981 Canadian census, respondents could only mark one ethnicity/ethnic ancestry, but the 1981 census and all future ones allowed multiple ethnicity responses. Canada also enumerated its population by place of birth from 1871 to the present day.

Costa Rica.
Costa Rica enumerated people by ethnicity in 1950.
Croatia.
The people of Croatia were enumerated by ethnicity/nationality under Yugoslavian rule from at least 1953 to the dissolution of Yugoslavia. They were also enumerated by ethnicity in the post-Yugoslavian Croatian censuses of 2001 and 2011.

Finland.
Finland has enumerated its population by language of most frequent use from at least 1990 to the present day.
France.
France has not counted individuals by race or ethnicity since at least 1978, when a law was passed that prevented individuals from being enumerated by these categories without their consent or a state committee waiver. The reasons for this are that many French people consider asking people about race and ethnicity to be a contradiction of their principle of equality and equal treatment for all French people. Also, there is a desire to avoid repeating what Vichy France did in regards to its Jewish population and to prevent the National Front from getting more popularity. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his administration supported and proposed counting French people by race and ethnicity. Due to criticism, however, this proposal was never implemented, and as of 2013 current French President Francois Hollande opposes enumerating people by race and ethnicity.
Gabon.
The population of Gabon was enumerated by ethnicity in 1960-1961 and 1993.

India.
When it was a British colony, India enumerated its population by race between 1872 and 1941.
Indonesia.
Indonesia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1930 and 2000, but not in any other censuses.
Ireland.
The 2002 Irish census enumerated people by their place of birth and their country of citizenship. Ireland introduced an ethnicity question to its census in 2006. The 2011 Irish census enumerated people by ethnicity as well, and offered the options White Irish, White Irish Traveller, Other White, Black or Black Irish (with options for African and Other Black), Asian or Asian Irish (with options for Chinese and Other Asian), Other, and Not Stated.
Israel.
The census in Israel directly asked people about their ethnicity only in 1983.

Kenya.
Since 1945, Kenya enumerated people by ethnicity from 1948 all the way up to its most recent census in 2009 (however, the 1999 census ethnicity figures were not made public). There were some concerns about asking an ethnicity equation in the 2009 census since it came just a year after the disputed Kenyan presidential election of 2007 and the riots that followed it, but Kenya went through with asking about ethnicity in 2009 anyway.

Russia/Soviet Union.
The Russian Empire began counting people by native tongue with its first modern census in 1897. In 1920, the Soviet Union replaced this question with a question about ethnicity. The Soviet government organized lists of ethnicities and wanted to shape these various ethnic groups in the mold of Communism. In the words of Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet Union was "creating and organising new nations" The government of the U.S.S.R. was eager to get ethnic data for many ethnic groups in order to create republics and autonomous regions for many of these ethnic groups and nationalities, and later on (under Joseph Stalin) in order to deport some of them. The Bolsheviks also wanted to get more support from ethnic minority groups within the Soviet Union, many of whom were previously oppressed under Tsarist rule. The Soviet Union continued to ask about ethnicity for the rest of its existence, and Russia also asked about ethnicity in its two post-Soviet censuses of 2002 and 2010. Unlike in 1989, the 2002 census did not require respondents to prove their ethnicity/nationality when they responded to this question. The number of ethnicity/nationality options available on Soviet censuses was enormous—the Soviet Union offered 194 different choices for ethnicity/nationality in its 1926 census. There were 97 options in 1939, 126 options in 1959, 122 options in 1970, 123 options in 1979, and 128 options for the Soviet Union in 1989.

United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom began counting people by ethnicity in 1991. There eventually became more of an interest in enumerating ethnic minorities after large-scale ethnic minority immigration to the United Kingdom began in the post-World War II era. The United Kingdom previously planned to enumerate people by ethnicity in 1981, but changed its mind after the large non-response rate to this question in the 1979 Test Census. In 1979, many ethnic minorities refused to answer this question due to the fear of deportation. In the 2011 census, the ethnicity options for England and Wales were White, Mixed, Asian British, Black British, Chinese or other ethnic group, and Not stated, with ethnic sub-group choices for most of these. The census in the United Kingdom also included a question on country of citizenship between 1851 and 1961.
United States.
Before the U.S. acquired independence from Great Britain, many of the Thirteen Colonies conducted censuses of their own where they enumerated their populations by race. The United States as a whole enumerated people by race in every census since its first census in 1790. Part of the reason why the United States began counting people by race much sooner than many other countries was due to the Three Fifths Compromise, which determined the amount of representation that Southern states had based on how many slaves they had (slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes, and a new census every ten years was needed to enumerate the current slave population). Initially, the United States Census only counted Americans as either white or black, with blacks classified as either free or slaves until 1860 (slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865). Over time, the United States has also added some other racial categories as well. Asian and Native American categories were added in 1860. However, the first census to enumerate all Native Americans occurred in 1890. Before that point Native Americans living on reservations were not counted, and thus most Native Americans in the U.S. were not counted in census data before 1890. Between 1850 to 1870, and in 1890, 1910, and 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau also enumerated Mulattoes and sometimes other partially black groups (Quadroons and Octoroons) separately.
The U.S. Census Bureau counted Mexicans as a separate race in 1930 and tried to retroactively determine the number of Mexicans in the U.S. in 1910 and 1920 as well.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a "good neighbor" policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935, a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.
Hispanics were counted as whites in 1940, but for the first time ever, the U.S. made an attempt to measure the size of the Hispanic population that year. The U.S. resumed enumerating its Hispanic/Latino population in 1970, with Hispanics being enumerated in every U.S. census since then. The U.S. Census Bureau also began offering Hispanics several sub-group options from which they could identify themselves, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, et cetera (these Hispanic sub-group options have changed over time). The Other race category was added in 1950, and the Multiracial ("two or more races") category was added in 2000. Due to the adding of the Multiracial category, U.S. Census data since 2000 is not directly comparable with that of previous censuses. While people nowadays are enumerated by race based on self-identification, until 1950 their race on the census was mainly determined by their census enumerator. During this time multiracial people who were White and of another race were usually marked down as belonging to the other race due to the One drop rule.
It is worth noting that some of the definitions of race in the United States changed over time. For instance, Indian Americans were previously marked as Hindu in 1920-1940, Other race in 1950-1960, and White in 1970 before being marked as Asian (Indian) since 1980. The U.S. census counted certain Asian ethnic groups separately since 1870, initially counting only Chinese and Japanese, but having other categories as well since 1910. It only began counting all people by ethnic ancestry since the 1980 census, though. The United States enumerated most or all foreign-born Americans by mother between 1910 and 1970, with the exception of 1950. It counted the foreign-born aged five or more by the language that they spoke at home since 1980. Before 1970, Alaska and Hawaii had different choices for race on their censuses in contrast to the continental United States.
The 2020 United States Census might allow Middle Easterners and North Africans to write in their ethnicity/race instead of merely marking them as White. Right now, and in the past, Arabs have been marked in the U.S. Census as White. This began in the early twentieth century when Arabs coming to the United States successfully petitioned to be marked as White in order to avoid entry quotas and have a greater chance of achieving success and avoiding discrimination.
The United States is one of the countries that uses racial and ethnic census data in order to create minority-majority districts, as is required by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. These districts were created in order to increase minority representation in the United States Congress following the end of legal segregation and racial discrimination in the Southern United States.
Since 1850, the United States enumerated its population by their country of birth of its population. The whole U.S. population was enumerated by country of birth between 1850 and 1930 and again from 1960 to the present day. Meanwhile, only the White population of the United States was enumerated by their country of birth in 1940 and 1950.
Uzbekistan.
People in Uzbekistan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. The Soviet Union (to which Uzbekistan also belonged) enumerated people by ethnicity for its entire existence. Uzbekistan has not conducted any censuses at all since 1989.
Vatican City.
Vatican City enumerated people by ethnicity in 1948.

Communist North Vietnam enumerated people by ethnicity in 1960, when Vietnam was still divided into two countries. After Vietnamese reunification, Vietnam enumerated its population by ethnicity from 1979 up to the most recent census in 2009.
Yemen.
Yemen enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1994. The British Colony of Aden (which is within Yemen's current borders) enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1946 and 1955.
Zambia.
People in Zambia were not continuously counted by race before independence, and when they were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census asked about language but not ethnic group, and the 1974 census asked about ethnic group, but not language. The 1980 census asked about ethnic group, mother tongue, and language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census asked about ethnic group and mother tongue. The 2000 census asked about ethnic group, language of most frequent use, and second language.
Zimbabwe.
People in Zimbabwe were enumerated by race between 1901 and 2002, but many censuses were done separately for Whites/Europeans and Blacks/Africans before the 1970s. People were enumerated by language only in 1982 (when they were enumerated by " father's dialect").

Muzayrib

Muzayrib (, also spelled Mzerib or Mzereeb) is a town in southern Syria, administratively part of the Daraa Governorate, located northwest of Daraa on the Syrian-Jordanian borders. Nearby localities include al-Shaykh Saad and Nawa to the north, Da'el, Tafas and al-Shaykh Maskin to the northeast, and al-Yadudah to the southeast. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Muzayrib had a population of 12,640 in the 2004 census. The town is also the administrative center of the Muzayrib "nahiyah" consisting of nine villages with a combined population of 72,625. Muzayrib also has a community of Palestinian refugees.
History.
Under the Ottomans, the town, famous for its springs and bazaars, served as the first major resting place along the Hajj caravan route from Damascus to Mecca. The town along with al-Shaykh Saad served as the main administrative center for the region of Hauran. In the 16th century, a fort was built on the orders of Ottoman Sultan, Selim I. The fort had a bent gateway, unlike other Hajj forts which had a straight entrance, and was built from the local dark grey and hard basalt rock. 
Instead of local janissaries, imperial troops were stationed at the fort of Muzayrib. The fort at Muzayrib, strategically located in the hinterland of Damascus, was the most solid demonstration of Ottoman power over Damascus, which experienced several revolts, both popular or by the local jannissary corps. Thus, the provincial leadership of Damascus stringently maintained control over Muzayrib. Because of its important role in the Hajj pilgrimage, large quantities of dry cakes were stored in the fort to provide for pilgrims who were dependent on the cakes for sustenance in their traversal of the desert or in to supply the inhabitants of Damascus in case of a shortage. 
Between 1517 and 1757, the "hajj" caravan at Muzayrib was attacked five times by Bedouins. In 1770, the rebel Egyptian army of Ali Bey led by Ismail Bey and an allied force led by Dhaher al-Omar, the Arab chief of the Galilee, stopped at Muzayrib on their way to capture Damascus. When they reached Muzayrib to face off with Governor Uthman Pasha, Ismail Bey decided to retreat because the encounter coincided with the arrival of the hajj caravan in the town. Dhaher unsuccessfully protested the move and the rebel armies withdrew.
In the 19th-century, the fort at Muzayrib contained large warehouses, minor dwellings and a small mosque. A spring located to the northeast emptied into a pond containing abundant fish. Ruins were situated along the western banks of the spring. Hajj pilgrims who came to Muzayrib, which was still the main resting place of the caravan route, remained in the town for several days, and during each "hajj" a large open market was held. An observer remarked at the end of the century that the place would have been blossoming, had it not been for the marshy and fever-producing surroundings.
The city was connected to the Ottoman telegraph network based in Damascus by 1875. A narrow gauge long railway line connecting Muzayrib with Damascus was inaugurated on 14 July 1894; the line was extended to the port city of Beirut in 1985. The railway, owing to its construction along an undeveloped trade route, was a financial failure. However, it helped to open up Lebanon and develop the agricultural industry in fertile volcanic plains of Golan and Hauran, making them the leading producers of wheat crops in the Middle East.

Wytze Keuning

Wytze or Wietse Keuning (21 December 1876, Tolbert - 18 December 1957, Groningen) was a Dutch school teacher and author, who wrote a 3-volume fictionalized biography of Ashoka the Great.
Keuning was born in :nl:Tolbert in the community of Leek, Groningen to Klaas Jurjens Keuning, a house painter and later bar owner, and Grietje Wijtzes van der Velde. Keuning became a school teacher and in August 1904 he married Martje Vermeulen from his hometown. The couple had one son (Klaas) in 1906, but divorced in February 1914. In 1915 he remarried Frouwiena Abresch in Groningen, with whom he had another son (Frits). Keuning became headmaster of a school in Groningen as well as editor of the newspaper :nl:Nieuwsblad van het Noorden. Keuning had an interest in Buddhism and Eastern philosophy and in 1937 retired early from his job as headmaster to focus on Ashoka, who had only been confirmed to be non-mythical in 1915. In his research, he might have benefitted from his proximity to the University of Groningen, where Sanskrit had been taught since 1881.
He published his magnum opus in 3 volumes between 1937-1947, which overlapped the 5-year-long occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany. In an interview late in his life, Keuning said that he was "intrigued by times of change in history", comparing the time in the Netherlands during his writing and Ashoka 's time in the Indian subcontinent. Keuning died of a stroke in 1957 at the age of nearly 81.
In the mid 1990s J. Elizabeth Steur translated the trilogy into English as a single volume. The titles of the three books as written in the combined volume are "The Wild Prince", "The Wise Ruler" and "The World's Greatest Teacher".

Cadillac Gage Commando Scout

The Cadillac Gage Scout (4 x 4) light reconnaissance vehicle has been designed as a private venture specifically for the export market and was first announced in October 1977 at the Association of the United States Army meeting in Washington D.C.
In 1983, it was confirmed that Indonesia had placed an order for 28 Scout vehicles as well as 22 Ranger armoured personnel carriers. Details of this vehicle, which is no longer manufactured or marketed are given in the armoured personnel carriers (wheeled) section.
In August 1986, it was announced that a foreign country had placed a US$22.8 million contract with Cadillac Gage for an undisclosed number of Scout reconnaissance vehicles with half the vehicles delivered in 1986 and the remainder in 1987. Middle East sources confirm that the country is Egypt and 112 vehicles were purchased.
By early 1999, a total of 140 Scout (4 x 4) vehicles had been built by Cadillac Gage.
Cadillac Gage is now part of Textron Marine & Land Systems. There has been no recent production of the Scout although marketing continues.
Description.
The welded hull of the Scout is made of special hardness Cadloy armour plate which will defeat at a minimum 7.62 mm armour-piercing rounds. The front, sides and rear of the hull are well sloped to afford maximum protection within the weight of the vehicle.
The front of the Scout is sloped at an angle of 76° from the top of the driver's hatch to the nose. In addition to providing ballistic protection it allows the vehicle to push its way through underbrush.
The driver is seated on the left side of the hull with the engine to his right and is provided with an adjustable seat and a single-piece hatch cover that slides to the front of the vehicle when he is driving with his head out. Driver vision is provided by three periscopes mounted forward of the hatch area.
The fuel tank is at the front of the hull between the wheels. The engine is coupled to an Allison Transmission four-speed automatic transmission via a Cadillac Gage power transfer unit. The complete power pack, consisting of the engine, transfer unit, transmission and cooling system, can be removed and replaced in two hours. Access to the engine is by a large hatch in the right side of the hull through which all fluid levels (coolant, lubricant, brake fluids and so on) can be checked.
The turret or pod is at the rear of the vehicle and access is by a two-part hatch in the rear of the hull with the bottom part folding downwards and the top part opening to the right.
The front suspension features coil springs over a solid axle with trailing arms. The split rear axle is tied to a heavy-duty coil spring suspension. Cone-shaped passages in the rear of the hull allow for high individual vertical roadwheel travel. Both axles are fitted with positive locking differentials which provide improved traction by preventing one wheel spin-out.
The integral hydraulic power steering is powered by a gear-driven pump working directly off the engine. This approach has eliminated the requirement for belt drives which slip or break and steering cylinders that require maintenance.
The independent front and rear brake systems function through a split master cylinder and a back-up system supports them in the event of an engine failure. The back-up system consists of an electric motor which supplies pressure to the master cylinder. The tyres are of the run-flat type. Standard equipment includes two hand-held fire extinguishers stowed inside the vehicle, a pioneer toolset, a breaker bar and lug wrench, a first aid kit, a vehicle toolkit, and an air compressor with a 15.24 m hose.
The Scout is not fitted with an NBC system, has no night vision equipment and is not amphibious. Optional equipment includes a siren/public address system, radio installations, weapon stowage, water and fuel cans, a slave cable, a 15.24 m auxiliary cable, a camouflage net, a smoke grenade system and a fragmentation grenade system.

The laws laid down by the Arthashastra prompt him to proclaim Sumana, his eldest son, as his natural successor. But, he feels that Ashoka is more able. But, Sumana is supported by the Brahmin Council who should not be messed with. The Brahmin council has a huge control over the people in the kingdom, for they make people believe in their spiritual powers, when most of them have none. They use persuasion and vile to dissuade Bindusara from appointing Ashoka as the Viceroy of Taxila, when a rebellion breaks out. However, Bindusara is aware of all their doings because he keeps a network of highly trusted spies. He ensures that Ashoka does not face much problems in his journey to Taxila. He also tells Ashoka to never let down his guard. In his way to Taxila, Ashoka prevents a woman from committing Sati. When he reaches Taxila, he realizes that the people had rebelled only because they were not happy with the administration. Ashoka helds meetings with his courtiers and the foreigners and restores peace.

Citation.
Presented posthumously for actions during the Vietnam War.
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Captain (Field Artillery) Allen Ross Culpepper, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Battery C, 7th Battalion, 9th Artillery, 54th Field Artillery Group. Captain Culpepper distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 18 May 1969 while serving as commander of a 105 millimeter howitzer battery. Soon after midnight a Viet Cong force launched a mortar and rocket attack, followed by a ground assault on the perimeter. Without hesitation, Captain Culpepper moved through the battery area to organize his troops. He quickly deployed a reaction force and directed the retaliatory fusillade of his men. When one of the howitzer emplacements was struck by rocket-propelled grenade fire wounding the section members, Captain Culpepper immediately proceeded to the damaged gun section to assist in removing the casualties. As he left his vehicle and heroically ran through the hostile barrage toward a wounded soldier, he was fatally wounded by enemy fire. Captain Culpepper's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty, at the cost of his life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.

<doc id="36889815" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36889815" title="Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention">
Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention

On Thursday, August 30, 2012, American actor and director Clint Eastwood gave a speech at the Republican National Convention. Eastwood had endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 United States presidential election earlier that month. Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Barack Obama. The speech, broadcast in a prime time slot, was viewed live by about 30 million Americans. It met with a wide array of responses and stirred discussion. 
Background.
Eastwood had a political background, as the non-partisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, and serving on various state commissions on parks and the film industry. He had (more quietly and casually) endorsed Republican candidate John McCain during the 2008 United States presidential election. On August 3, 2012, Eastwood had formally endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for the 2012 presidential election, speaking at a fundraiser for the candidate.
The three broadcast networks each devoted one hour of coverage to the convention per night, during the prime 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. time slot. In response to criticism that conventions are over-scripted, organizers did not disclose the identity of the first speaker who had been given the high profile speaking slot. On August 30, CNN reported that Eastwood was the "mystery guest".
Speech.
Eastwood made an unannounced appearance at the convention, speaking at the top of the final hour. The speech was scheduled to last five minutes. Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Barack Obama. The speech lasted about 12 minutes, and was characterized by multiple news sources as "rambling". In at least two instances, Eastwood implied the President had uttered profanities directed both at Romney and himself, saying "What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that, he can't do that to himself."
Following his conversation with the empty chair, Eastwood turned his focus to the delegates and the audience at home, stating in part "But I'd just like to say something (...) that I think is very important. It is that, you, we, we own this country. (...) it's not politicians owning it; politicians are employees of ours (...) And whether you're Democrat or whether you're a Republican or whether you're Libertarian or whatever, you're the best. And we should not ever forget that. And when somebody does not do the job, we got to let 'em go." The speech ends with a reference to "Go ahead, make my day", spoken by Eastwood character "Dirty Harry" Callahan from the 1983 film "Sudden Impact".
Eastwood's speech was viewed live by 30.3 million Americans, across at least 11 television networks which were broadcasting coverage of the convention. (Those numbers do not count those watching on C-SPAN, whose audience is not measured.)
Responses.
Eastwood's remarks were well-received within the convention hall, but responses were mixed outside the hall.
Film critic Roger Ebert commented, "Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic. He didn't need to do this to himself. It's unworthy of him", and later elaborated that while he continues to revere Eastwood as an artist, he opined that Eastwood was "handed the wrong sheet music". Breitbart.com editor-at-large John Nolte was more positive in his review, stating that the performance was "funnier, fresher, edgier, and braver than anything those comedy cowards Chris Rock, Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert have done in 15 years." Bill Maher, a comedian and talk show host who has been highly critical of Republicans and conservatives in general, praised Eastwood's performance and his decision to go off-script during a heavily scripted affair: "As a performer, as a stand-up comedian for 30 years who knows how hard it is to get laughs... he went up there... without a net, on a tightrope. There was no teleprompter. He did a bit with just an empty chair and "killed"." Mark Steyn spoke particularly favorably of Eastwood's closing statement, referring to it as "some of the hardest lines of the convention." Jon Stewart commented on the August 31 episode of "The Daily Show" that Eastwood's performance could be understood as a metaphor for the existence of "a President Obama that only Republicans can see", who bears "so little resemblance to the world and the President that I experience".
Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker described the speech as "that one moment, which I cringed about", former Romney adviser Mike Murphy tweeted: "Note to file: Actors need a script," while Ann Romney commented to "CBS This Morning" that Eastwood is "a unique guy and he did a unique thing last night. We appreciated Clint's support. I didn't know it was coming." "The New York Times" quoted unnamed Romney aides describing the Eastwood speech as "strange" and "weird". One Romney aide described it as "theater of the absurd." According to the "Times", the Eastwood appearance was cleared by senior campaign leaders Russell Schriefer and Stuart Stevens, who drew up a rough set of talking points for Eastwood. Staffers reported that unlike other speakers at the convention, there were no rehearsals for Eastwood's speech, nor did they require Eastwood to be on script.
Staffers also reported that Eastwood's use of the chair was a last-minute decision by the actor himself. Eastwood confirmed this in a September 4 interview with "The Carmel Pine Cone": "There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I wanted to sit down. When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea." Eastwood further elaborated that he purposely avoided preparing for the speech to make it appear unpolished and more appealing to the average citizen.
During his speech, Eastwood said, "See, I never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway," apparently referencing President Obama. Amy Argetsinger of the "Washington Post" and Joe Palazzolo of "The Wall Street Journal" both noted that Romney has a Juris Doctor; as Palazzolo wrote, Romney "is a trained lawyer and a businessman. He earned both his J.D. and his MBA at Harvard University, in a dual-degree program." Romney passed the Michigan bar exam, but has never practiced as an attorney, instead pursuing a career in management consulting.
The incident led to the "Eastwooding" Internet meme spreading via Twitter whereby people would pose next to empty chairs, sometimes pointing at the chairs. The episode was also lampooned in "The Onion". The model of chair, designed in 1992 by the Italian architect/designer Sergio Mian, was profiled as well. Inspired by the Eastwood speech, a Texas man hanged an empty chair in effigy.
The speech follows a long-standing American tradition of empty chair debating, dating back to at least 1924, as pioneered by Vice-Presidential nominee Burton K. Wheeler. The style of the conversation was noticeably similar to the humorous one-sided conversations popularized by Bob Newhart in the 1960s; Newhart himself joked in a tweet: "I heard that Clint Eastwood was channeling me at the RNC. My lawyers and I are drafting our lawsuit." Bloggers have suggested that Eastwood was attempting a form of Gestalt therapy either for himself or for the Republican Party generally.
In a September 7, 2012, interview with his hometown newspaper, "The Carmel Pine Cone", following his speech at the Republican Nation Convention, Eastwood said that "President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people," and "Romney and Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that's what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle."
Following Obama's poor performance in the first general presidential debate of the 2012 cycle, Eastwood's empty chair symbol was revived. "The New Yorker" featured a caricature of Romney debating Eastwood's chair (drawn by Barry Blitt) for its October 15, 2012, edition.
On November 7, 2012, the day after President Barack Obama won reelection, Daniel Day-Lewis brought a chair onstage at the 2012 BAFTA Britannia Awards and congratulated it. Day-Lewis added: "I love Clint Eastwood, this is no satirical comment on him or his politics...When I saw him talking to a chair in front of a roomful of strangers, I thought: "I've got to try that."
Several months later, following the election, Eastwood revealed to CNBC anchor Becky Quick that his infamous "empty chair" skit had been inspired by a Neil Diamond song ("I Am... I Said") that had come over the radio in his Tampa hotel room and that included a lyric about an empty chair not hearing the singer's laments.
The now-iconic chair itself was transported from Florida to the offices of Reince Priebus, the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. While the chair is among many pieces of political memorabilia in Priebus' office, it is the first item he points out to reporters.

Functionality.
Musink automatically takes care of many of the basic rules of music notation, such as correct stem direction and vertical alignment of multiple rhythmic values, as well as established rules for positioning of noteheads on chords. Stem directions and mark positions can also be manually adjusted. Projects can be split into unrelated sections, allowing creation of documents such as exercise books.
Drum and Percussion Support.
Musink supports a number of marks and settings specific for drummers. These include sticking marks, ghost note brackets, flam-style gracenotes, and special notehead shapes. Layout settings for staves can also be switched to 'drum default' layout rules.
MIDI.
Projects can be played from Musink during editing through connected MIDI devices, including VST instruments. Project sections can be exported as MIDI files. The software will also export bars of music as MIDI loops. Musink Pro additionally supports live MIDI recording, MIDI step-input, and MIDI-file import operations.
PDF Creation.

During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Beijing Legation Quarter became the center of an international incident as it was besieged by Boxers for several months. After the siege had been broken by the Eight-Nation Alliance (that included Italy) at the end of the Battle of Peking, the foreign powers obtained the right to station troops to protect their legations under the terms of the Boxer Protocol. In addition, Italy obtained a concession in Tientsin, southeast of Peking.
On 7 September 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the Kingdom of Italy by the Qing Dynasty of China. On 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by an Italian consul: the first was Cesare Poma and the last (in 1943) was Ferruccio Stefenelli.
Along with other foreign concessions, the Italian concession lay on the Pei Ho, southeast of the city centre.
In the late 1920s, the Italians even held small forts like the "Forte di Shan Hai Kuan" near the Great Wall of China in Manchuria and in Hankow.
In 1925, Benito Mussolini created the "Battaglione italiano in Cina" and quartered it with soldiers of the San Marco Regiment in the new Caserma Ermanno Carlotto. By 1935, the Italian concession had a population of about 6,261, including 110 Italian civilians and about 536 foreigners. The police were Chinese, while the officers were Italians. The Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) stationed some vessels at Tientsin. There was even a football team in the Italian concession.
During World War II, the Italian concession in Tientsin had a garrison of approximately 600 Italian troops on the side of the Axis powers. On 10 September 1943, when Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, the concession was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Later in 1943, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) formally relinquished the concession to the Wang Jingwei's Japanese-sponsored Chinese puppet state, the Reorganized National Government of China which, like the RSI in Axis-held northern Italy, was not recognized by the Kingdom of Italy, the Republic of China, or most other nations. The Wang Jingwei government fell when the Empire of Japan was defeated. At the same time, the Italian commercial concessions in the Shanghai International Settlement, Hankou and Beijing were ceded to the Republic of China.
On 2 June 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became the Italian Republic and, on 10 February 1947, by virtue of the peace treaty with Italy, the Italian concession was formally ceded by Italy to Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China.

Emilio Veratti

Emilio Veratti (24 March 1872, Varese - 24 February 1967) was an Italian anatomist and pathologist. He is known for his discovery of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
He studied medicine at the Universities of Pavia and Bologna, where he received his doctorate in 1896. Following graduation he worked for Camillo Golgi (1843-1926) at the Institute of General Pathology in Pavia. Here he distinguished himself by way of research in the fields of histology and microbiology. Eventually he attained the title of "libero docente" (equivalent of privat-docent) in histology and general pathology.
In 1921 he established a bacteriology laboratory in the medical clinic at Pavia. In 1930 he was successor to Aldo Perroncito (1882-1929) as professor of general pathology, a position he kept until his retirement in 1942.
In March 1902, he provided the first accurate description of the reticular network (sarcoplasmic reticulum) in skeletal muscle fibers. His published findings attracted little attention at the time, and as years passed by, his discovery was all but forgotten. In 1961 "Veratti's reticulum" was re-discovered through the use of electron microscopy.

Alid Revolt (762–763)

The Alid Revolt of 762–763 or Revolt of Muhammad the Pure Soul was an uprising by the Hasanid branch of the Alids against the newly established Abbasid Caliphate. The Hasanids, led by the brothers Muhammad (called "the Pure Soul") and Ibrahim, rejected the legitimacy of the Abbasid family's claim to power. Reacting to mounting persecution by the Abbasid regime, in 762 they launched a rebellion, with Muhammad rising in revolt at Medina in September and Ibrahim following in Basra in November. The lack of co-ordination and organization, as well as the lukewarm support of their followers, allowed the Abbasids under Caliph al-Mansur to react swiftly. The Caliph contained Muhammad's rebellion in the Hejaz and crushed it only two weeks after Ibrahim's uprising, before turning his forces against the latter. Ibrahim's rebellion had achieved some initial successes in southern Iraq, but his camp was riven by dissent among rival Shi'a groups as to the prosecution of the war and future political objectives. In the end, Ibrahim's army was decisively defeated at Bakhamra in January 763, with Ibrahim dying of his wounds shortly after. The failure of the rebellion did not mark the end of Alid unrest, but it consolidated the power of the Abbasid dynasty.
Background.
Following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632, a strong body of opinion within the nascent Muslim community—the antecedents of the Shi'a—held the Family of Muhammad ("Al Muhammad") to be the only rightful leaders, who would have the divine guidance necessary to rule according to the Quran and bring justice. These sentiments were fed by the increasing discontent against the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled the Caliphate from 661 until 750. Initially, they were expressed by a succession of failed risings—most notably the Battle of Karbala in 680 and the uprising of Zayd ibn Ali in 740—in support of various Alid claimants, i.e. the descendants of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad and fourth Caliph (r. 656–661), whose death had marked the rise of the Umayyad family to power. Iraq and Kufa in particular became centres of pro-Alid support. It was the Abbasids, however, and their supporters, the "Hashimiyya", who launched the revolution that overthrew the Umayyad regime. The Abbasids claimed authority based on their membership in the extended "Al Muhammad" through the Prophet's uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib; unlike later Shi'a doctrine, membership of the Family was not strictly limited to the Alids at that time, but encompassed the entire Banu Hashim. The Abbasids were able to exploit the weakening of the Alid cause after Zayd's failure in 740, as well as the widespread anti-Umayyad sentiment and lack of pro-Alid agitation among the numerous Arabs settlers of Khurasan, to gain their backing and secure the leadership of the anti-Umayyad movement for themselves. Nevertheless, in the first stages of their uprising, they were careful not to antagonize the Alids' supporters, and merely called for a "chosen one from the Family of Muhammad" ("al-rida min Al Muhammad") to become the new Muslim leader.
Following their takeover of the Caliphate, the Abbasids tried to ensure the Alids' acquiescence through honours and pensions. However, some Alids remained opposed to Abbasid rule, going into hiding and once again trying to rouse the discontented against the new regime. Chief among them were Muhammad ibn Abdallah and his brother Ibrahim. Both had been groomed by their father as leaders since their youth, and some sources even claim that he had received the "bay'ah" (oath of allegiance) of the "Hashimiyya" leaders, including the future Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), in 744, before the Abbasid Revolution. Muhammad was often called "the Pure Soul" ("al-Nafs al-Zakiyya") for his noble character, but he was also "a somewhat unworldly, even romantic, individual" (Hugh N. Kennedy) and apparently less capable or learned than his younger brother Ibrahim. When the Abbasids took power, the two brothers refused to accept what they regarded as the usurpation of their legitimate rights and went into hiding. From there they continued their work of proselytism, which reportedly brought them as far as the Sindh, although mostly they stayed in Arabia. The first Abbasid caliph, al-Saffah (r. 750–754), was content to mostly ignore their activities, but his successor al-Mansur launched a manhunt against them. In 758, al-Mansur arrested their brother Abdallah when he refused to reveal their whereabouts, followed in early 762 by their cousins and nephews. The captive Alids were taken to Kufa, where they were mistreated so that many of them died.
Muhammad's revolt in Medina.
As al-Mansur's persecution intensified, pressure began to mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, and the two brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina. Although the Alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, the action was rushed and lacked organization.
On 25 September 762, Muhammad declared himself at Medina, catching the Abbasid governor, Riyah ibn Uthman, by surprise. The rebellion was bloodless and Muhammad quickly gained the support of the old Muslim families of Medina and Mecca (the "Ansar"), but the movement had been doomed from the start: despite Medina's great symbolic value, it had little strategic importance, and the error of using it as the centre of a rebellion became apparent when the Abbasids immediately cut off the grain supply from Egypt that fed the city. Al-Mansur himself was relieved at the news of the uprising in such a remote location, remarking that at last he had "enticed the fox out of his hole". Al-Mansur left Baghdad, whose construction he was supervising, for Kufa. From there he called upon Muhammad to surrender, promising an amnesty. The only fruit of this offer was an exchange of letters, which are preserved (though doubtlessly much embellished) by al-Tabari. In them, Muhammad reiterated his claim to leading the Muslims, and stressed his descent from Ali and Fatimah, the Prophet's daughter, as well as his typically Shi'a ideals of rejecting the absolutist monarchical traditions of the Umayyads—now adopted by the Abbasids—in favour of returning to the simpler practices of early Islam. Al-Mansur countered by invoking the pre-Islamic tradition of inheritance, which gave priority to a man's male relatives over his daughters—implying that the Caliphate had passed to the Abbasid line by right.
Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, was sent against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused to abandon the holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of the Prophet, like restoring the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited a few days before the ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.
Ibrahim's uprising in Basra.
Due to Muhammad's rushed actions, Ibrahim failed to co-ordinate his own uprising with his brother's, and only declared himself two weeks before Muhammad's death, on 23 November. Ibrahim's revolt at first met with quick success, securing control over Ahwaz, Fars and Wasit, and his army register ("diwan") was said to number 100,000 names. When the news of Muhammad's death arrived, the rebels acclaimed Ibrahim as his successor. Ibrahim now was faced with a choice: a group of dedicated Alid supporters, which had managed to escape from Kufa, urged him to march on the city, while the Basrans preferred to stay in place and reach a negotiated settlement. This dissension is indicative of the disparate nature of Ibrahim's supporters. The Alid cause was fractured into several competing groups with different political objectives, and Ibrahim represented the Hasanid branch only. The Husaynids refused to take part in an uprising, while Ibrahim quarrelled with the Zaydi branch on everything from political objectives and leadership to the tactics to be followed or the provisioning of their troops. Elsewhere, support for the uprising was cautious and most Alid supporters adopted a wait-and-see attitude, limiting themselves to verbal support or contributions of money.
Al-Mansur in the meantime used his time more effectively: he mobilized troops in Syria and Iran and brought them to Iraq, and recalled Isa ibn Musa from Medina to lead them. Finally, Ibrahim decided to march on Kufa, but on the way he abandoned this plan and turned back. Instead of returning to Basra, however, he encamped at Bakhamra, a location on the road between the two cities. There, on 21 January, Ibrahim with his troops, reduced by defections to some 15,000 men, confronted the Abbasid army under Isa ibn Musa. Isa's vanguard was at first beaten, but the battle ended in a crushing Abbasid victory. Ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped with a handful of supporters. He died of his wounds on 14 February 763, signalling the end of the rebellion.
Aftermath.
The failure and brutal suppression of Muhammad and Ibrahim's revolt was followed by a large-scale reprisal campaign against the Alids, many of whom were imprisoned or killed, until the death of al-Mansur brought about another period of attempts at conciliation under al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), which ended after another Alid uprising in 786. The relationship of the Abbasids with the Alids remained troubled: periods of repression, usually following pro-Alid revolts, were alternated with periods of relative tolerance. Although al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) at one point nominated an Alid, Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, as his heir during the Fourth Fitna, this move was not followed up, and under Ma'mun's successors, the two families became completely estranged. Of Muhammad's sons and brothers, many fled the Abbasid persecution to the remoter corners of the Caliphate, where they sometimes succeeded in establishing local dynasties, e.g. the Idrisids of Morocco, founded by Muhammad's brother Idris, or the Alavids in Tabaristan.

Tell Shihab

Tell Shihab (; also spelled Tell esh-Shihab or Tal Shehab) is a village in southern Syria, administratively part of the Daraa Governorate, located northwest of Daraa on the Syrian-Jordanian borders. Nearby localities include al-Shaykh Saad and Nawa to the north, Muzayrib, Da'el and Tafas to the northeast, and al-Yadudah to the east. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Tell Shihab had a population of 9,430 in the 2004 census.
Etymology.
The town's name is "purely Arabic" according to George Adam Smith, and "Tell Shihab" is translated as "Mound of the Warrior."
History.
Ancient.
Tell Shihab is believed to be the site of the ancient city of Yeno'am. The location of the tell surrounded by the Yarmuk River, corresponds to the description of the town. Furthermore, a stele from Seti I, was discovered in 1900 by George Adam Smith at the tell confirming that it was one of the sites conquered by the Egyptian king during his campaigns in the region. The stele, missing the lower part, was built into the wall of a local house, and shows Seti I with Amun-Ra and Mut. Wilhelm Max Müller argued that the stela did not commemorate the victory, but rather expressed the loyalty of the dedicator to his king. Bronze Age pottery sherds were also found on the site during excavations conducted by William Foxwell Albright in 1925.
Ottoman.
At the end of the 19th century, the village had 750 inhabitants and 160 houses, and was described as "blossoming".
In the early 20th-century, the sheikhs of Tell Shihab belonged to a powerful family in the area and relative prosperity of the town allowed them to accumulate large amounts of wealth. According to Smith, who visited in 1900, "nearly all the villagers look happy and comfortable."
Modern.
During the current anti-government uprising in Syria, opposition rebels gained control of Tell Shihab and it has since been used as a major crossing point for Syrian refugees fleeing to Jordan. On 6 September 2012, the Syrian Army launched an assault on the town with the backing of 20 tanks, according to opposition activists. A number of houses were allegedly raided and some people were detained by the authorities.
Geography.
Tell Shihab is situated on the promontory formed by the junction of Wadi al-Meddan and Wadi Tell Shihab, which represents the modern borders between Syria and Jordan. With the presence of several "wadis" there is an abundance of water in the town. It is one of the lowest-lying towns in the mountainous Hauran region, with an elevation of over above sea level. Surrounding Tell Shihab are stretches of wheat fields.

H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger for More 2)

H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger for More 2) is the third studio album by American hip hop recording artist Lloyd Banks, released on November 22, 2010 through G-Unit Records and EMI.
Background.
Using Twitter, Lloyd Banks originally stated that the album was called "The Hunger for More 2". It was unknown whether the album name was official or not.
The title of the album was later confirmed by 50 Cent in an interview with MTV News. The album was thought to be possibly released under Interscope, by a new contract of the label and the rapper; also the Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine revealed that he wants to sign the rapper to Interscope again, and he asked label mate 50 Cent "what can I do to sign Lloyd Banks again?". Banks has said that he is willing to re-sign, but only if Interscope is willing to issue an apology for "doubting him."
On August 13, 2010, Banks said this about his upcoming album, "When I wrote For More, I took my whole life and tried to squeeze all those experiences into one album,". "You’ve got your whole life to make your first album and you can’t get it all out in 14 songs. There are a lot of similarities between "The Hunger for More" and "H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger for More 2)". One, the fact that I made both of these albums without any distractions or input from the label, or anyone else for that matter. Two, the energy feels the same."
Banks announced that his album would be released under G-Unit Records and EMI. After the album was released, Lloyd Banks stated that he completed the one-album deal with EMI and he was a free agent again. In an interview on Global Grind live, he stated that he had worked with J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League on the project.

The album was under-shipped and much of the retailers were sold out; Lloyd Banks stated himself in an interview he couldn't find his album anywhere (Best Buy, Wal-Mart, etc.) EMI under-shipped Bank's album. The album also peaked at number 4 on the Canadian Albums Chart.
Critical response.
Upon its release, "H.F.M. 2" received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 9 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Slava Kuperstein of HipHopDX noted a marked improvement over Banks' 2006 effort "Rotten Apple", stating that "the execution isn’t as good the second time around, but Banks has reestablished his sound, and made clear that he is still a major force to be reckoned with in the rap game." Allmusic writer Dave Jeffries, despite citing a lack of new ideas as one of the album's weaknesses, was also positive about the album: "At 13 tracks the album feels right-sized, not overstuffed, and Banks himself is in fine form throughout, delivering stone cold and slow punch lines that are as lethal as ever. When it comes to evolution, there’s really none, but even though he’s been here before, veteran fans will appreciate his return."
Giving the album a rating of 7/10, Ben Detrick of "Spin" stated that "Lloyd Banks' hunger is not born of starvation, but of an insatiable appetite. On his third solo effort, the G-Unit rapper is a connoisseur of cars, women, and guns, spinning tight spider webs of syllables that are often so patterned that they obscure individual strands. "Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a running start," Banks growls on "Payback," a sinister track with mentor 50 Cent and a woozy, almost dubstep bass line. But he loves the ladies almost as much as barking threats. On "So Forgetful," an apology to past conquests, Banks muses about "wet spots on the mattress and champagne splashes" atop producer Ryan Leslie's 8-bit Atari synths." Steve Jones of "USA Today" was also positive about the album, giving the album 3/4 stars and citing that "the G-Unit rapper seeks to rekindle the spark of his critically acclaimed 2004 platinum debut by recalling both the title and the potent street vibe. Banks enlists several like-minded rappers — Pusha T, Styles P, Juelz Santana and Raekwon— who complement his own grittiness. The same goes for R&B stars Akon and Lloyd as he relies mainly on his signature jaw-breaking punch lines while eschewing a rash of poppish hooks. Banks is well served by his refusal to compromise just for airplay. His Hunger should whet his fans' appetites for even more."

Castle warrior

A castle warrior (, ) was a landholder obliged to provide military services to the "ispán" or head of a royal castle district in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Castle warriors "formed a privileged, elite class that ruled over the mass of castle folk" (Pál Engel) from the establishment of the kingdom around 1000 AD. Due to the disintegration of the system of castle districts, many castle warriors became serfs working on the lands of private landholders in the 13th and 14th centuries; however, some of them were granted a full or "conditional noble" status.
Origins.
The origin of castle warriors can probably be traced back to Stephen I, the first crowned king of Hungary (1000 or 1001–1038), since most royal castles were erected during his reign. However, the settlement of armed commoners around princely fortresses may well have begun under the rule of his father, Grand Prince Géza. The "jobbágy" or "iobagio" expression, first recorded between 1127 and 1131, is of Hungarian origin, connected to the Hungarian word for "better" "(jobb)".
Castle warriors held landed property with a territory carved out from royal estates attached to a royal castle. In return for this landholding, they rendered military service to the "ispán" of the royal castle. Their property was often quite large, with a territory of about .
Flowering.
Although landholders were superior in status to castle folk, royal legislation did not treat castle warriors as full-fledged freemen. For instance, a castle warrior who had departed from his lord was "regarded as a fugitive in the same way as a runaway serf" (Pál Engel). Nevertheless, they had the right to appeal to the monarch against the "ispán" they were serving. Moreover, they could not be deprived of the land they owned, which passed to their children upon death. Castle warriors were also exempted from the "pennies of freemen" ("denarii liberorum" or "liberi denarii"), a tax payable by all freemen to the kings.
Castle warriors appointed by the "ispáns" held the chief offices of the castle districts. Thus both the heads of the "hundreds" (the basic units of the administration of a district), and the officers of the military contingent of the castle were always chosen from among their number. Likewise, the castellan was always a castle warrior in the first centuries of the kingdom. Castle warriors were eager to preserve their special status, thus they frequently sued "udvarniks" or castle folk who tried to take their lands or usurp their privileges. Even so, castle folk were sometimes elevated to the higher status of castle warriors.
Disintegration.
The alienation of some pieces of "castle lands" began under the early kings of the Árpád dynasty, which initially always resulted in the resettlement of castle warriors on new lands. However, King Andrew II (1205–1235) distributed large parcels of "castle lands" (sometimes whole counties) among his followers. This resulted in a significant number of castle warriors losing their direct contact with the monarchs and becoming subject to the authority of other lords. Even the status of those who remained on castle lands were threatened from the 1370s by the emerging idea of "royal right". According to this concept, all land that was not owned by the nobility or an ecclesiastic body belonged to the monarch, thus the property rights of those who had not been ennobled could be questioned.
Nevertheless, many castle warriors were granted nobility by the monarchs in order to "remove the 'stain of ignobility' which was attached to castle service" (Martyn Rady). Even castle warriors living in castle districts distributed to private landholders could receive special collective liberties, although they were never granted "true nobility". For instance, the "noble "iobaigiones" of Turopolje" in Zagreb county were granted the right to elect their own judges, a right which they preserved until the 19th century.

Witch camp

A witch camp is a settlement where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety, usually in order to avoid being lynched by neighbours. Witch camps exist solely in Ghana, where there are six of them, housing a total of around 1000 women. Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.
Many women in such camps are widows and it is thought that relatives accused them of witchcraft in order to take control of their husbands' possessions. Many women also are mentally ill, a little understood problem in Ghana. In one camp in Gambaga, the women are given protection by the local chieftain and in return, pay him and work in his fields.
The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps and educate the population regarding the fact that witches do not exist.

<doc id="36890184" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36890184" title="Captain Price">
Captain Price

Captain John Price is a major fictional character in the "Call of Duty" series and one of the two main protagonists, appearing as an experienced soldier and a strong leader in the series. He is somewhat compassionate, but can be ruthless at times. Price was well received by critics and fans alike, being listed as the 17th top video game characters of "Guinness World Records 2011 Gamers' Edition".
Captain Price first appeared as a British soldier featured in "Call of Duty" and "Call of Duty 2" as a member of the British Army and British SAS during World War II. He appears again as John Price in the "Modern Warfare" series, where he is playable in two flashback missions in ', and in the final mission of '. He is one of the three characters that appeared in all three Modern Warfare games. The others were John "Soap" MacTavish and Nikolai. In every game developed by Infinity Ward there has been a Captain Price.
Character design.
The character is said to have been based upon British SAS soldier John McAleese, who was involved in the Iranian Embassy siege and also co-hosted the television series "SAS Survival Secrets" in 2003. He is also a reference to a similarly looking character in the famous war film "A Bridge Too Far". Price's callsign, Bravo Six, is a direct reference to the 1986 war movie "Platoon", in which Captain Harris' callsign is exactly the same as Price's. John Price was voiced by actor Billy Murray, while Price from World War II was voiced by Michael Gough.
In an interview with Sami Onur, a character designer for Infinity Ward, a "retcon" explanation was provided that John Price is the grandson of the Price who appeared in early "Call of Duty" games, though this has not yet been confirmed by Infinity Ward staff. In the early developments of ' ("MW2)", Price was scheduled to be the player's commander, not "Soap" MacTavish, as he was supposed to be the playable character instead of Roach. This is further explained in the artbook for "MW2". A character named Master Sergeant "Sandman" appears in ' as Delta Team’s leader. He is described by Robert Bowling as the equivalent to an “American Captain Price”.
Characterization.
The only major change made to Price's characterization throughout the series was his mustache, of which Graham Linehan famously stated that it was "the only reason to care about the character at all, that it defined him apart from any of the other dial-a-grunt stereotypes in the game". In "Soap's Journal", Soap refers to Price's mustache as the "Dick Tickler". The difference between the mustaches of the two Prices is that World War II Price has an ordinary horseshoe mustache, albeit with cleaner shaven cheeks and a more gentlemanly look. John Price on the other hand has a bushier mustache with thick sideburns.
Price always plays a leadership role in the series, training protagonists like Soap, as well as leading army units and SAS squads. In "Call of Duty 2", he begins as a regular soldier, but is transferred to the SAS for D-Day, then is back with his old mates again a few days later only to be re-transferred again to the SAS. Price wears different types of headgear, but the maroon (para) beret and boonie hat are his trademarks, with rare exceptions. The only other headgear used are a gasmask, as seen in "F.N.G.", "Crew Expendable", and "Return to Sender"; the beanie in "The Gulag"; and the beret seen in his profile in the cutscene to "Endgame". He is never seen without headgear, but his short hair is seen when his gas mask is on in "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare". John Price has a buzz cut, as seen in "Crew Expendable". His favorite brand of cigars is Villa Clara, according to "Soap's Journal."
Both Prices are taken captive by enemies. He is captured twice by the Nazis in "Call of Duty" 1 and 2, and is imprisoned in the Gulag in "Modern Warfare 2". World War II Price speaks fluent German, but fails to forge German files. "Modern Warfare's" John Price speaks Russian and Arabic, but in the mission "Persona Non Grata", Price hands the UGV to Yuri, saying, "The controls are in Russian." He has brushes with death at the end of each "Modern Warfare" game and is saved by a main character (Soap or Yuri) from being killed by the main antagonist (Imran Zakhaev, General Shepherd, or Vladimir Makarov). He is wounded at the end of all three "Modern Warfare" games.
Both Prices are very skilled marksmen, as shown by sniping missions in every "Call of Duty" 1 and 2 mission of the British campaigns, and in "Modern Warfare" missions "All Ghillied Up", "Contingency" and "Stronghold", or in the mission "Endgame", in which he snipes a helicopter from a raft, hitting its engines, despite floating a river with a strong current. In the mission "One Shot, One Kill", Price manages to destroy another helicopter with one sniper shot, while fending off enemy attackers and carrying his superior, Captain MacMillan, to safety. Bugs or glitches in the game can sometimes make Price miss a shot completely. Most of his missions in the whole series rely on stealth, such as sabotaging a Nazi battleship in World War II, attempting an assassination in Pripyat, or infiltrating an American base in Afghanistan.
He is also a master hand-to-hand combatant, boxer, and knife fighter in exceptional physical condition for a man of his age. In "Call of Duty" 1 and 2, he can kill an enemy with only one blow from a rifle butt or a single pistol whip, while it takes two to three blows for a player to kill an enemy using the melee mode. In "Modern Warfare 2", Price engages the antagonist, General Shepherd, in a brutal fistfight. After a few brief moments, the fight begins to turn in Shepherd's favor as he punches Price in the face, causing him to fall to the ground. Shepherd then slowly and relentlessly beats Price before Soap saves Price by throwing a knife at Shepherd's left eye. Although this is the canonical case, by no-clipping, the player can see Shepherd putting Price in a headlock, after which Price reverses it and holds Shepherd in a headlock until Soap pulls the knife out of his chest, at which point Shepherd will be seen punching Price as before. If one watches the fight when Soap first goes to look at the knife, it can be clearly seen that Price is free of the consistent punching, suggesting he may not have originally needed help before release. He is also shown having great athletic skills. In the mission "Just Like Old Times", he kills a U.S. Special Operations combatant by stealthily rappelling down and stabbing him. In missions like "Dust to Dust", he performs long-distance jumps even when hampered with heavy gear.
Personality.
Price is known as grumpy and serious in every mission, nonetheless cracking insults and jokes along the way. At the beginning of every British campaign, Price will razz the protagonist with these insults, such as the way he mocks Soap and casts doubt on his skills and ability to pass as an SAS, or how he yells at Davis for not taking cover from German fire. These insults, combined with his crude English accent, make up many of the series' memorable quotes. As the player progresses, the relationship between Price and the protagonist strengthens to the point of friendship. World War II Price provides covering fire for Sgt. Davis during their retreat from Amaye sur Seulles, and notably saves his friend Sgt. Evans by sacrificing himself as a shield against oncoming Nazi fire. In "Modern Warfare 3", John Price mourns the loss of Soap and the Task Force, grieving over his fallen friends and teammates, and later exacts revenge on the men who killed them, despite peace being made.
Although ruthless and merciless at times, Price demonstrates morality and high principles. He shows his lighter side in many of the series' missions. In the "Call of Duty 2" mission "Prisoners of War", World War II Price and his squad encounter wounded members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. He forbids his squad to harm the surrendering Nazis, and orders the player to get transportation for the wounded, though knowing that a German armored counterattack is approaching. He stays behind to protect the wounded Rangers, and holds the enemy at bay while awaiting delayed evacuation. In the "Call of Duty 4" mission "Hunted", after surviving a helicopter crash in enemy-held Western Russia, a farmer is seen being harassed by an ultranationalist. Price orders Soap to save the farmer, even though the odds of discovery by enemy scouts are high. It is up to the player to save the farmer or let him die. In the "Modern Warfare 3" mission "Dust to Dust", Price and Yuri attempt to kill Makarov in his hotel hideout. During their firefight outside and inside the hotel, civilians and hotel attendants run aimlessly, trying to escape the gunfight. Many of them accidentally run toward the protagonists and block their view of the enemy. Price nevertheless orders Yuri not to shoot at the civilians and prevents some of them from being shot by the enemy.
Weapons.
World War II Price's main weapon, and sometimes his only weapon, is a Lee-Enfield, with the exception of him carrying an MP-40 in the last mission. In the Dew XP promotion, the Combat Card of John Price states that his main weapons of choice are the CM901 and the MSR, despite never using them in-game, but in "Call of Duty 4", Price's weapon of choice appears to be the M4A1. In all of the "Modern Warfare" series, he carries an M1911 and Desert Eagle semiautomatic handguns as his sidearms. Immediately after Soap's death, Price leaves an M1911 pistol on his body, which he leaves behind out of respect for Soap. This is the same M1911 used to kill Khaled Al-Asad and Imran Zakhaev, which Soap returned to him in the mission "The Gulag".
World War II Price's weapons are the Lee-Enfield, Kar98k, Bren LMG, MP40, Sten, Thompson SMG, Luger, and a Scott Webley Revolver. While John Price's weapons are M4A1 SOPMOD, M1911, M21, A Regular M4A1, USP .45, Barret .50 cal, AK47, M14 EBR, AUG HBAR, SCAR-H, CheyTac Intervention, Remington Adaptive Combat Rifle (ACR), Desert Eagle, CM901, PKP, and MSR.
In the "" mission "Dust to Dust", Price wears explosive ordnance disposal armor (nicknamed the juggernaut armor) in his assault on Makarov's hideout (Burj Al Arab). Though not entirely bulletproof, the armor is strong enough to withstand waves of bullets from machine guns and high-powered rifles. It protects the wearer from a single hit from an RPG or from nearby grenade explosions. The armor is heavy, slowing Price to a walk. Because of its weight, it is vulnerable to swarming enemies, close-quarter melee, constant RPGs, and a well-placed overcooked grenade.

Chronologically, World War II Captain Price firstly appeared in the battle of Pegasus Bridge in Call of Duty 1. Secondly appeared on October 29, 1942 in "Call of Duty 2". He was leading the 7th Armoured Division as part of the Second Battle of El Alamein. Their mission was to destroy enemy supply depot and acquire any enemy documents. After succeeding their mission, the division is immediately redeployed to defend a small town 30 miles south of El Alamein. After this Price and the 7th Armoured Division took part in Operation Supercharge on November 3, 1942, to secure the gaps in the antitank minefield, so that the British armour can pass through safely. They then successfully charged through the trenches, taking out many Flak 88 crews along the way. They then rallied at the German communications outpost, where news of the success was broadcast back to headquarters. It was followed by an assault on El Daba which Price had only a small part. In March 10, 1943, they were stationed ahead of the main force of the 7th Armoured Division at Toujane in Tunisia and awaiting the reinforcements. They quickly find themselves overwhelmed by a German counterattack, and are forced to retreat. Price, with his squad consisting of Pvt. MacGregor and Sgt. Davis, tried to commandeer a German Armoured Car and attempt to drive out of Toujane. After the armoured car they were riding on hits a mine, they retreat by foot, meeting up with some other men from the 7th Armoured Division, and escape via a German truck. In the retreat some of Price's men were cut off, and despite MacGregor protests, Price realized that even if they turned back to get the men, they would all be overwhelmed. The assault on Matmata on March 30, 1943 was the last of the campaign. The division were ambushed before entering, leaving Price and his men to fight their way in and through the town, Price and MacGregor provide covering fire as Davis takes out the German dive bombing planes, after this the team collects all intel and supplies before moving out of Matmata and ending the North African Campaign.
After the victory in North Africa he served at Pegasus Bridge on the 5th and 6 June 1944 with fellow soldier Sgt. Evans. After the gliders that brought them in landed, Price ordered Evans to suppress a bunker before preceding. They successfully held the bridge until they were relieved by friendlies. A week after the D-Day landings the Allied forces were struggling in the Battle for Caen. To break the stalemate, the 7th Armoured Division including Captain Price were brought in. They started off by securing the village of Beltot 18 miles east of Caen. Price orders Davis and MacGregor to get a German truck to evacuate the soldiers, stating that he is almost envious that for the American prisoners, the war is over. A German counter-attack left them pinned down in the barn by a German Tiger Tank. Captain Price kept calm despite morale running low, and they were saved when the RAF took out the Tiger. They kept moving in toward Caen and by midday on June 12, 1944 they arrived at St. Louet, 15 miles east of Caen. However due to the loss of the tanks because of another German Tiger tank, they were ordered to pull back to Caumout. While retreating they came under heavy mortar fire. They held their own at Amaye sur Seulles and managed to assist the rest of the division in retreating to Caumout.
Captain Price was transferred to the SAS. At some point, during an unspecified mission, Price's plane was shot down behind enemy lines in Austria. Price was captured, and he was taken to a chateau in the Alps. He was rescued by 101st Airborne Division on August 7, 1944. Later, on September 2, 1944, Price was sent to the Eder Dam in a special operation to destroy the anti-air defenses and the electrical generators. Sgt. Waters, a member of the SAS, assisted the two by helping Price steal an Opel Blitz truck filled with Panzerfausts. Price then makes a getaway from the dam to the airfield. At the airfield, he defends Evans with a Bren Gun while the latter mounted a Flakvierling stationed at the airfield. They were then successfully extracted. Price's final mission on October 27, 1944, was to sabotage the "Tirpitz", a German battleship that was considered a threat by the RAF. He used his knowledge of German language and forged papers to infiltrate the battleship along with Sgt. Evans. Evans and Price then managed to get to the armory. Unfortunately, after another soldier checked the duo's papers at the armory, Price killed him and blew their cover. While attempting to defend Evans as he planted explosives on the ship's boilers, he was surrounded and killed. This is the first mission in the "Call of Duty" series where a main character is scripted to die. Video game easter eggs show him in the Modern Warfare series. In , an emblem features World War II Captain Price, while there is an achievement/trophy named Blackjack. In the achievement/trophy picture, there is a playing card with a picture of World War II Price.
"Modern Warfare".
Another Price, now named John Price, appeared in the Modern Warfare series set in a more contemporary setting taking place in the early 21st century. Price is a Captain in the 22nd SAS Regiment and the commanding officer of Gaz, player character John "Soap" MacTavish, and their squad, designated Bravo Team. He leads the team to investigate an Ultranationalist cargo ship sailing in the Bering Strait. Price then rescues a Russian democratic loyalist named Nikolai from a Russian prison camp, and escapes a helicopter crash caused by a GAM with the support of an AC-130 gunship. Meanwhile, insurgent leader Khaled Al-Asad seizes power in an unnamed Middle-Eastern country and executes its president, Yasir Al-Fulani. The United States Marine Corps invades the country to depose Al-Asad and restore order to the region. However, a rigged nuke hidden in the capital is detonated (presumably by Al-Asad, but it is eventually discovered to have been done by Vladmir Makarov), killing 30,000 Marines. Captain Price leads the squad to capture Al-Asad, who is revealed to work for Ultranationalist leader Imran Zakhaev. Price executes Al-Asad and reveals that he and his commanding officer Captain MacMillan attempted to assassinate Zakhaev in 1996, but only managed to shoot off his left arm. Eight hours later, Ultranationalist infantry and armor corners Bravo Team, but they are rescued by Marines led by SSgt. Griggs. The SAS and Marines form a Joint Task Force Operation Group and attempt to capture Zakhaev's son, Victor Zakhaev, to learn of his father's whereabouts. However, the cornered Victor shoots himself, rendering their efforts pointless and angering Zakhaev even more. He plans to retaliate by launching ICBMs armed with nuclear warheads at the East Coast of the United States. Price and Bravo Team head to the Altai Mountains to infiltrate the base containing the ICBMs and prevent their launch, but two missiles are launched. He and his team upload the abort codes, destroying the nukes over the Atlantic. In their attempt to escape via enemy vehicles, they are cut off by a Hind gunship and forced to stand their ground in a collapsing bridge while waiting for rescue. A tanker truck explodes, badly wounding Price and the others. Griggs is killed by enemy machine gun fire, and Zakhaev arrives and executes Gaz. Before Soap can be executed, Price manages to slide his M1911 to Soap, who kills Zakhaev and his two bodyguards. Afterwards, the Loyalists arrive and extract the heavily wounded Soap and Price.
, five years after the events of the first game, Price has been incarcerated in a Russian gulag in the Kamchatka Peninsula . During his imprisonment, Makarov starts a war between Russia and America by slaughtering hundreds of Russian civilians at an airport and leaving the dead body of CIA mole Joseph Allen to be used as a scapegoat. International special ops unit Task Force 141, led by Lieutenant General Shepherd and consisting of Soap (now a captain), Lieutenant Simon "Ghost" Riley and Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson, successfully rescues Price from the gulag. He agrees to join the unit and leads the team to help save Washington, D.C. from a Russian invasion by using a submarine to launch a submarine-launched ballistic missile, creating an EMP that cripples vehicles, GPS, and electronic equipment on both sides, giving the Americans an advantage (and accidentally destroying the ISS in the process). However, during an arms deal that is raided by Price and Soap, they are betrayed by Shepherd, who has secretly masterminded the war between America and Russia with the goal of restoring America as a military superpower with him as its hero. Shepherd personally murders Roach and Ghost and orders his men to kill Price and Soap, but they escape the trap. Price asks Makarov for information, and he reluctantly reveals the location of Shepherd's mountain base in eastern Afghanistan. Price and Soap head to Shepherd's base, intending to kill him. Shepherd attempts to flee on a speedboat and manages to reach a helicopter, but Price disables it by shooting its rotor blades shortly before going over a waterfall. Just as Shepherd is about to kill Soap, Price intervenes and enables Soap to kill him. The two are then evacuated by their old friend Nikolai, who informs them of a potential hiding place. During the course of the betrayal, Price and Soap are labeled as war criminals, and .
"Modern Warfare 3" picks up where left off. Price and Nikolai arrive at a safehouse in India with a critically wounded Soap. Price enlists the aid of Yuri, an ex-Spetsnaz with a grudge against Makarov. Price calls in favors from people he had worked with before: MacMillan from , now running SAS operations under the callsign "Baseplate"; and Delta Force operative Master Sergeant "Sandman". The now-disavowed Task Force 141 follows their first lead to Africa, but is unable to stop Makarov from unleashing a biological weapon on Europe and escalating the conflict into World War III. Capturing a Somalian warlord named Waraabe, they learn the location of Makarov's bomb maker, Volk. Price passes the information to Sandman, who then goes to Paris and captures Volk. Volk reveals that Makarov will be meeting his top lieutenants at the Hotel Lustig in Prague, Czech Republic. Price and the 141 attempt to assassinate Makarov. However, Makarov, aware of the assassination plan, reveals that Yuri is a former associate of his before detonating a trap and killing Soap. A furious Price confronts Yuri at gunpoint, who reveals that he was one of Makarov's top lieutenants until he became disillusioned with Makarov's increasingly extremist tactics. When Makarov decided to massacre hundreds of civilians at Zakhaev International Airport, Yuri betrayed him, but was shot and left for dead. Price reluctantly spares Yuri and forms another plan to kill Makarov. With intelligence from Yuri and MacMillan he sneaks into a castle in the Russian-occupied Czech Republic that is being used as an Ultranationalist hideout. Yuri and Price discover that Alena Vorshevsky, daughter of the kidnapped Russian president, is hiding in Berlin and that the Ultranationalist Russians plan to capture her. Sandman unsuccessfully attempts to rescue her, but learns that she and her father are being held in a diamond mine in Siberia. Delta Force and Task Force 141 team up and rescue the president and Alena, but Sandman and his fireteam are wiped out while buying Price and Yuri time to escape. Due to their actions, the war between Russia and the west is ended and Price's name is cleared. Three months later, Price and Yuri suit up in full Juggernaut gear and assault Makarov's hotel hideout. During the assault, Yuri is seriously wounded and urges Price to continue without him. Price reaches the roof, disables Makarov's escape helicopter, and confronts him. Makarov attempts to kill Price, but Yuri intervenes at the cost of his own life. Price springs up and wraps cables around Makarov's throat before plunging him through a glass roof, hanging him. Price, satisfied with his revenge, lights a cigar as police sirens are heard in the background.

Abraham Kahlil Mitra

Abraham Kahlil Mitra is the current provincial governor of Palawan, a fast-growing archipelago-province in the Southern Tagalog Region. He is the youngest son of former House of Representatives Speaker Ramon Mitra, Jr. and Cecilia Aldeguer Blanco. He is popularly known to people both in Palawan and elsewhere as "Baham".
Political career.
Following the footsteps of his father who served the Philippine government for a very long time, Baham Mitra entered politics at a very young age. Baham served as a Presidential Consultant for Palawan from 1998 until 2000 under former President Joseph Estrada. He became a member of the House of Representatives representing the second legislative district of Palawan for three consecutive terms until 2010. Programs and projects for the welfare of his representation were massively implemented as he lobbied for the national government to appropriate sufficient funds thereof. High priorities were made for health, education, environmental protection and for the prime mover of the province's growth- tourism.
Mitra bid for a gubernatorial post during the 2010 synchronized local and national elections. His attempt was full of trials as he was lambasted with protests allegedly for his unqualified residency requirement for such position. This complicated saga begun as opponents accused Baham of lying on his residency status. He claimed to had lived in a basement of a feed mill located in the municipality of Aborlan where he has been living since March 2008. Legal battle ensued as it reached the Supreme Court where if finally tendered its decision on Mitra's favor on October 2010.
Baham's stint as the provincial governor is also dramatic as recall election followed as he seated in the provincial capitol. This made headlines as a sectoral group called Kilusan Love Malampaya (KLM) filed a petition for recall on alleged grounds of "loss of trust and confidence" on September 2011. In a statement, KLM accused Mitra of having "compromised" Palawan's interests for accepting Malacañang's offer of a significantly smaller portion of the province's share of royalties amounting to P60 billion paid by the Malampaya consortium operating the natural gas project in offshore northern Palawan close to the municipality of El Nido. However, this election did not realize, as the Commission of Elections was not able to decide on the matter immediately and the next mid-term elections for 2013 is just a few months away.
Baham Mitra's leadership in the Palawan is very interesting. Innovative ways of leading this province comprising hundreds of islands and atolls became significant for its growth. It gains popularity for its promotion of sustainable development through economic and tourism synergy working hand in hand to achieve holistic progress.
Personal life.
Governor Abraham Khalil Mitra was born on January 3, 1970 in Manila. He finished his elementary at the Benedictine Abbey School in Alabang, Muntinglupa City in 1983. He continued his secondary schooling at the same school until 1987. He then studied BS Management at another Benedictine-run school, San Beda College and graduated in 1991.

Shi Family Grand Courtyard

Shi Family Grand Courtyard (Tiānjīn Shí Jiā Dà Yuàn, 天津石家大院) is situated in Yangliuqing Town of Xiqing District, which is the former residence of wealthy merchant Shi Yuanshi – the 4th son of Shi Wancheng, one of the eight great masters in Tianjin. First built in 1875, it covers over 6,000 square meters, including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses, a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family. Shifu Garden, which finished its expansion in October 2003, covers 1,200 square meters, incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and delicacy of south garden. Now the courtyard of Shi family covers about 10,000 square meters, which is called the first mansion in North China. Now it serves as the folk custom museum in Yangliuqing, which has a large collection of folk custom museum in Yanliuqing, which has a large collection of folk art pieces like Yanliuqing New Year pictures, brick sculpture. 
Shi's ancestor came from Dong'e County in Shandong Province, engaged in water transport of grain. As the wealth gradually accumulated, the Shi Family moved to Yangliuqing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence. Shi Yuanshi came from the fourth generation of the family, who was a successful businessman and a good household manager, and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale. It is believed to be the first mansion in the west of Tianjin. 
The residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passage way in the middle, on which there are four archways. On the east side of the courtyard, there are traditional single-story houses with rows of rooms around the four sides, which was once the living area for the Shi Family. The rooms on north side were the accountants' office. On the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worshiping Buddha, theater and the south reception room. On both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants. 
Today, the Shi mansion, located in the township of Yangliuqing to the west of central Tianjin, stands as a surprisingly well-preserved monument to China's pre-revolution mercantile spirit. It also serves as an on-location shoot for many of China's popular historical dramas. Many of the rooms feature period furniture, paintings and calligraphy, and the extensive Shifu Garden.
Part of the complex has been turned into the Yangliuqing Museum, which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyards' construction, local folk art and customs, and traditional period furnishings and crafts.

The project is being developed at a cost of 35,000 million within a special economic zone and comprises two distinct elements, namely, a processing zone and a non-processing zone.
The processing zone is the IT portion of the development consisting of four office buildings of approximately 60 m in height. The buildings are arranged around central courtyards located at ground and at the podium level. The courtyards serve as the centre of activity for the IT complex, providing links between the various amenity functions.
The buildings are being built in 6 blocks with five levels of car parking, including three levels of basement carparking along with additional multi-level carparking, and 13 floors, with a total area of 4.5 million sq ft. The towers are named Hardy Tower, Carr Tower, Neville Tower and Littlewood Tower. The project has obtained Green Building certification (as per LEED Gold Guidelines—Pre-certified) and IMS certification. Utility buildings are also being constructed to support the IT facilities. The buildings have 8-m-high entrance lobbies, and each floor has floor-plates ranging from 50,000 sq ft to 100,000 sq ft in various blocks, with a floor-to-floor height of 3.75 m.
The non-processing zone consists of a mixed-use development consisting of a convention centre, retail, residential, hospitality and entertainment facilities along with below-ground carparking.
Other developments.
The project also has 100 serviced apartments of the Taj Vivanta brand and a 1,500-seater convention centre, operated by the IHCL. This project also envisages development of a residential community named "Cambridge Greens", with apartments ranging between 2,000 sq ft and 3,000 sq ft.
Major occupants of the buildings include Cisco, Pershing India Operational Services Pvt Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Hewlett Packard, Infosys, Mindtree, Sitel, Taurus Quest and Datacert (DCI). Cognizant has taken for lease one full building of about 650,000 sq ft.

Neil Fachie

Neil Fachie MBE (born 12 March 1984) is a Scottish paralympic multiple sports athlete competing in events for individuals with a visual impairment. Fachie has entered two Paralympics, as a sprinter in the 2008 Games in Beijing and as a tandem cyclist in London 2012. In London he won the gold medal in the Men's individual 1km time trial and silver in the individual sprint, both with Barney Storey as his sighted pilot.
Career history.
Fachie was born in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1984. Faiche, who has a congenital eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, studied physics at Aberdeen University. There he took up athletics and at the age of 24 he qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, running in the 100m and 200m sprints. After failing to take a podium place in either races in China, Fachie decided to change sports to cycling.
The strength Fachie had built up during his time as a sprinter was instrumental in impressing the Great Britain cycle coaches. By September 2008 he was training with the GB Para-Cycling Team and was part of the team by April the following year. In 2009 he entered the Para-Cycling Track World Championships, with Barney Storey as his pilot. The two took the Gold in both the Kilo and Sprint, setting a new world record in the Kilo. In 2011 Fachie travelled to Montichiari, Italy to compete in his second Para-Cycling Track World Championships. This time paired with Craig MacLean, he again achieved gold in both the Kilo and Sprint, setting a new world record in the Sprint.
Fachie entered his third Para-Cycling Track World Championships, thi time held in Los Angeles, USA. His pilot in the America was Barney Storey, who would team up with Fachie at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The pair took the silver in the Kilo. That year, in the Paralympics, Fachie and Storey competed in the Men's 1 km time trial for riders with a visual impairment. The pair set a world record time of 1:01.351, and after team mates and main rivals Anthony Kappes and Craig MacLean suffered a mechanical failure, took the gold medal.
Fachie was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to para-cycling. In June 2013, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Aberdeen by the Duchess of Rothesay. 
Fachie teamed up with Pete Mitchell for the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The pair won the gold medal in the tandem 1km time trial, and broke the world record set by Fachie and Storey at the 2012 Paralympics by setting a time of 59.460 seconds, becoming the first tandem pairing to clock a sub-minute time for the kilo time trial. They subsequently won a second gold in the tandem sprint.

James Grigson

James Grigson (born 1932 in Texarkana, Texas; died 2004), known as "Doctor Death",
was a Texas forensic psychiatrist who testified in 167 capital trials, nearly all of which resulted in death sentences.
Grigson made a name for himself as a testifying expert for the prosecution in capital cases. Under Texas law, for death to be imposed the jury must believe the defendant not only to be guilty of the crime charged, but certain to commit additional violent crimes if not put to death. In almost every case Grigson testified (often after meeting the defendant for just a few minutes, or not at all) that the defendant was an incurable sociopath who was "one hundred per cent certain" to kill again.
In 1995 Grigson was expelled by the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians for unethical conduct,
the APA stating that Grigson had violated the organization's ethics code by "arriving at a psychiatric diagnosis without first having examined the individuals in question, and for indicating, while testifying in court as an expert witness, that he could predict with 100 per cent certainty that the individuals would engage in future violent acts".
Grigson unsuccessfully sued the APA to block his expulsion.
After Grigson's expulsion the medical director of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law said that Grigson "oversteps the bounds of his professional competence" and testified in court about hypothetical situations containing insufficient detail for a sound professional opinion to be formed.

<doc id="36890456" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36890456" title="Cuisine of Tianjin">
Cuisine of Tianjin

Cuisine of Tianjin () is derived from the native cooking styles of Tianjin, China. The cuisine of Tianjin is renowned throughout China, and not only the traditional Tianjin snacks, but the cuisines from other regions of China can also be found. Tianjin Cuisine Street is a fairly good place for you to sample these cross-cultural Chinese dishes.
Difference from Beijing cuisine.
Tianjin cuisine differs from Beijing cuisine in the following ways:
Goubuli Steamed Stuffed Bun.
Goubuli Steamed Stuffed Bun (“Dog does not care” Steamed Stuffed Bun) 
Goubuli's stuffed buns are known for their generous filling, which is succulent but not greasy. This famous snack was created during the late Qing Dynasty by a native of Wuqing County, who had the nickname "Doggy". At the age of 14, Doggy left home and came to Tianjin, where he was apprenticed to a restaurant specializing in stuffed buns. 
A diligent and honest young man, he eventually opened a shop of his own. As his stuffed buns tasted better and had a unique flavour, they attracted an increasing number of customers. As time went by, his nickname became known far and wide. Later, people changed "Doggy" (Gouzi) to "Dog does not care" (Goubuli), which literally means "the Doggy who doesn't talk", because he was often too busy to speak to his customers. Then, eventually, his buns were called by the same name.
Today, with its main outlet located at Shandong Road, Heping District, the Goubuli Bun Shop has developed into a corporation with 89 branch restaurants opened in Tianjin and two dozen other Chinese cities, provinces and regions. In addition to over 90 varieties of stuffed bun, its restaurants also offer more than 200 dishes.
Ear-Hole Fried Cake.
The Ear-Hole Fried Cake is another one of the famous traditional Tianjin snacks. It derived its name from the narrow Ear-Hole Street in Tianjin's Beidaguan, where the shop selling it was located. The Ear-Hole Fried Cake has a history of more than 80 years. lt was introduced by a man named Liu Wanchun, who peddled it on a single-wheel barrow from street to street. 
When his business prospered, he rented a room and opened Liu's Fried Cake Shop. Because the fried cake he made was of high quality, reasonable in price and had a special flavour, it soon became a popular snack. The cake is made of carefully leavened and kneaded glutinous rice dough. The filling is bean paste made with good-qualified red beans. The pastry of the finished cake is golden in colour, crisp and crunchy, while the filling is tender and sweet with a lingering flavour.
Fried Dough Twist (Ma hua).
Although plain in look, this queue-shaped fried dough is by no means easy to make. Each bar of dough is made with quality flour and then fried in peanut oil. The bars are usually stuffed with a variety of fillings, most often the waxy tasting beanpaste (Dou sha) - a taste for only the hardy. Since it can be preserved for several months, you can take some of this crispy specialty back home to share with family.
Chatang.
Chatang is Tianjin's traditional snack. It is made of baked millet and glutinous millet flour. The soup is made by pouring boiling water to the mixed flour and then adding sugar or brown sugar. 
The way chatang being served at stalls is as attractive as the soup itself. The water is boiled in a big copper pot whose spout is usually fashioned into a dragon's head. While making the soup, the skilled chatang maker holds severaI bowls in one hand and pours the boiling water into them from quite a distance.
Guobacai.
A snack of strong local flavour, guobacai is a sort of pancake made of millet and mung bean flour. The pancake is sliced and cooked in the sauce made of sesame oil, chopped ginger, soy sauce, preserved beancurd and green onion. Guobacai is often served along with fried dough and sesame cakes. 
Tangdui.
It is a custom in Tianjin to eat tangdui on the eve of the Chinese New Year. The most popular tangdui is made of hawthorn berry. Hawthorn berries have their seeds removed and are skewered on a thin bamboo stick, then dipped in hot syrup. When they turn cool, the stringed berries wrapped in crystal sugar look like beautiful stone beans pungently sweet and sour. 
Sometimes, the hollowed hawthorn berries are filled with red bean paste, walnut and melon seeds. Today, in addition to hawthorn, a wide variety of tangdui has been developed, including water chestnut, tangerine, apple, pear and crab-apple, etc.
Nanshi Cuisine Street.
Nanshi Cuisine Street (Shipin Jie) is like a shopping mall, only full of food. There are two levels and about 50 restaurants, all under one roof. Some are dirt cheap street stalls, others are more like sweet shops, some are top of the range restaurants with prices to match. Make sure you check prices before you order - they're rarely displayed. There are plenty of good dumpling restaurants and you can also eat dog, snake and most of the more unusual Chinese dishes.
Tianjin preserved vegetable.
Another characteristic of Tianjin cuisine is its utilisation of Tianjin preserved vegetable (天津冬菜), which is similar to the salt pickled vegetable, or "yancai" (腌菜) of Guizhou cuisine, but the former takes much longer to prepare than the latter, usually half a year. Another clear distinction between the two is that instead of having two separate steps of salt pickling and then fermentation, the salt pickling and fermentation is combined in a single step that takes a much longer time.
The Chinese cabbage is mixed with salt and garlic together and then fermented, which creates the unique garlic flavour / taste and golden color. In order to preserve the unique taste, Tianjin preserved vegetable is often used for soups, fishes, and stir fried and directly eaten.

Půta II of Častolovice

Půta II of Častolovice (also known as "Půta the Elder"; first name sometimes spelled as "Puota" or "Puotha", last name sometimes spelled as "Častolowitz" or "Czastolowitz"; ; d. 1397) was an east Bohemian nobleman. He was a member of the noble Častolovice family and held high office in Bohemia.
Life.
Půta was mentioned for the first time in 1342, when King John of Bohemia granted the village of Častolovice, which Půta owned, the status of a small town. In 1352, Emperor Charles IV appointed Půta to Burgrave of Potštejn. From 1350 to 1369, Půta held Liebenau castle in Czarny Bór in the Wałbrzych mountains.
From 1368 to 1377, he held various positions at the court in Prague. In 1377, he was appointed governor of Ząbkowice Śląskie. From 1366 to 1378, he was also governor of Kladsko. From 1372 to 1380, he administered Lower Lusatia and in 1377 a part of Brandenburg. Under Charles IV's successor Wenceslaus, Půta served as governor of Luxembourg from 1384 to 1386 and from 1395 until his death, he was governor of Lower Lusatia again.
In 1387, Půta and Boček II of Poděbrady purchased the Lordship of Skuhrov nad Bělou and Rychmberk Castle in the foothills of the Orlické hory mountains from the brothers Jan and Jaroslav of České Meziříčí. In 1396, he transferred ownership of these possessions to his wife; this suggests that he was the sole owner at that time.
Marriage and issue.
Půta was married to Anna (d. between 1440 and 1454), a daughter of Duke Jan II of Oświęcim. They had one son:

He studied in Sárospatak between 1584 and 1585 under the supervision his close relative and godfather, István Melith. He served as "aulae familiaris" (marshal) in the court of Balthasar Báthory from the end of the 1580s. Presumably he served there until the execution of Balthasar by his cousin, Sigismund Báthory in 1594. Later he moved to the Transyvanian Royal Court and became "aulae familiaris" again for Regent Maria Christina of Austria, wife of Sigismund Báthory who fled Transylvania in 1597 at the first time.
Under Prince Andrew Báthory, he participated in the Battle of Sellenberk in 1599, where the Transyvanian army suffered a severe defeat from Michael the Brave, ruler of Wallachia. Petki was able to escape, along with his father-in-law, Farkas Kornis, from the battle to Görgény (today: "Gurghiu, Romania"). They were nearly captured in 1600, their possessions were seized by Michael the Brave. In the next year, he was a member of the delegation appointed by the Diet of Kolozsvár (today: "Cluj-Napoca, Romania") which sent to Moldavia to call back Sigismund Báthory to retake the Transylvanian throne.
Political career.
Petki served as treasurer from 1601 to 1602. He functioned as envoy for Báthory to Poland with a secret mission since the autumn of 1601. Later he moved to Prague. He was also a member of the delegation of the Diet of Gyulafehérvár (today: "Alba Iulia, Romania") in 1603 which offered Transylvania to Emperor Rudolf II.
He became Captain of Udvarhelyszék on 19 December 1604. He joined to the uprising of Stephen Bocskay in 1605 who appointed him as General of the Székelys in the next year. After that he joined with the Székely army to commander-in-chief László Gyulaffy. After the illness and death of Gyulaffy, he served as interim commander-in-chief for a short time. Then the new commander Menyhért Bogáthy and him besieged Segesvár (today: "Sighișoara, Romania") and played a key role in occupation of the castle. As a reward he was elected to the Royal Council of Bocskay. In 1606, he served as chairman of the Ccmmittee of inquiry which investigated the border clashes between Transylvania and Moldavia. After the death of Bocskay, he accompanied the transportation of the body to Kolozsvár.
János Petki had a decisive role in the election of Sigismund Rákóczi in March 1607. The newly-Prince nominated him as Chancellor of Transylvania. He also became a member of the Royal Council and functioned as General of the Székelys and Captain of Udvarhelyszék. He received as a donation the estates of Nagysajó (today: "Şieu, Romania") and Küküllővár (today: "Cetatea de Baltă, Romania"), previously owned by the late Menyhért Bogáthy. On 31 March 1608, on the day of the election of the new prince, Gabriel Báthory, he resigned from his position on the reason of deterioration of his health.
Báthory did not like Petki, so that he tried to keep him away from Gyulafehérvár. As a result Petki served as his envoy to Moldavia three times in 1608. Udvarhelyszék rebelled against him in absentia. Báthory took advantage of the situation and replaced him from the position of captain. Along with Pongrác Sennyey he functioned as royal commissioner for reviewing of the Székely donations. He was the Lord Lieutenant (Count; "comes") of Doboka County since 1610.
Later life.
In the summer of 1611, he joined to the army of Baron Zsigmond Forgách who invaded Transylvania, but fled to Brassó (today: "Brașov, Romania") after the failure of the campaign. The Transylvanian Diet sentenced him to confiscation of property on 25 May 1612. A few months later, he died on 23 October 1612 after a long illness.

The Invaders (novel)

The Invaders is the second in a series of novels called "Brotherband" by Australian author John Flanagan. The book was released in Australia on 1 May 2012.
Synopsis.
Hal and his crew are chasing Zavac. However due to a massive storm, they are forced to stop and resume the chase later. They then camp at Shelter Bay for a few weeks, where they repair their ship, add the Mangler, a hull fin, and learn from Thorn. Afterward, they go to a small village to stock up on supplies while asking about Zavac's ship the Raven. Meanwhile, Zavac and his crew take over a trading fleet's vessel when looking for the chashbox they find emeralds. Zava demands to know where they have come from. The leader of the trading fleet reluctantly tells where the emeralds come from. Zavac goes to Limmat, a town with a secret emerald mine. Zavac overruns the town easily and forces the miners to work quicker and harder so he can take it all on his ship to sell.
While Hal is going back to shelter bay, he thinks he sees "Wolfwind" and sails south for a day. While heading back they find Lydia, a girl from Limmat who tells them of the pirate attack. Hal thinks it may be Zavac so he continues back to shelter bay. "Wolfwind" finds them but ends up helping them. The next day, they start sailing to Limmat, and when they arrive, they see Zavac's ship. Thus, they hide in the marshes where they find the town's soldiers. Hal forms a plan with the locals to take back the town in 5 days. They are able to take back the town but Zavac slips away and cripples "Wolfwind", but Hal is able to save the members of the crew.

<doc id="36890602" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36890602" title="Sustained load cracking">
Sustained load cracking

Sustained load cracking or SLC is a metallurgical phenomenon that occasionally develops in pressure vessels and structural components under stress for sustained periods of time.
It is particularly noted in aluminium pressure vessels such as diving cylinders.
Sustained load cracking is not a manufacturing defect; it is a phenomenon associated with certain alloys and service conditions:
Occurrence.
Crack growth is reported to be very slow by Luxfer, a major manufacturer of aluminium high pressure cylinders. Cracks are reported to develop over periods in the order of eight or more years before reaching a stage where the cylinder is likely to leak, which allows timely detection by properly trained inspectors using eddy current crack detection equipment.
SLC cracks have been detected in cylinders produced by several manufacturers, including Luxfer, Walter Kidde, and CIG gas cylinders.
Most of the cracking has been observed in the neck and shoulder areas of cylinders though some cracks in the cylindrical part have also been reported.
History.
The phenomenon was first noticed in 1983 in hoop-wound fibre reinfoced aluminium alloy cylinders which burst in use in the USA. The alloy was 6351 with a relatively high lead content (400ppm), but even after the lead content was lowered, the problem recurred, and subsequently the problem was detected in monolithic aluminium cylinders. The first incidence of a SLC crack in the cylindrical part of a cylinder was reported in 1999.
Detection.
Neck cracks are readily observed during inspection, but body and shoulder cracks are more difficult to detect 
Neck thread cracks can be non-destructively tested using eddy current crack detection equipment. This is reported to be reliable for alloy 6351, but false positives have been reported for tests on alloy 6061.
Contributory factors.
All of these forms of crack development are the result of the cylinder being subject to high pressure for prolonged periods. The cracks are intergranular, and occur at grain boundaries. There is no evidence of stress corrosion or fatigue.
The presence of a relatively high lead content has been identified as a contributory factor. Cracking at the grain boubdaries is accelerated in the presence of lead. The presence of bismuth is also suspected to be contributory.
Alloy composition has also been found to be a factor. Alloy 6061 has shown good resistance to SLC, as have alloys 5283 and 7060.
Manufacturing defects such as folds on the inside surface have been shown to be harmful, particularly for parallel threaded cylinders.
Grain size has been shown to be of relatively minor importance.

Sub auspiciis Praesidentis

In Austria, the highest possible honor for achievement is the "promotio sub auspiciis (prasidentis rei publicae)". In this ceremony, the head of Austria honors the country's best students with a gold ring, engraved with the words ""sub auspiciis praesidentis"" and the emblem of Austria.
History.
The history of the promotio sub auspiciis goes back to the 17th century, when the best philosophy students at the University in Vienna were invited to the Palace of the Holy Roman Emperor to receive gold medallions embossed with the Emperor's profile. This was a reward for their excellent achievements for their country. 
In the following centuries, until the abolishment of the monarchy in 1918, this tradition became widespread and was coined ""promotio sub imperatoris"" (under the eye of the Emperor of Austria) for Universities in the Austrian part or ""promotio sub regis"" (under the eye of the King of Hungary) for universities in the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
After World War II, beginning in 1952, the term ""sub auspiciis"" was reintroduced with the addition of ""praesidentis rei publicae"" (under the eye of the President of the Republic). 
Requirements.
In order to qualify for this honor, an individual must be perceived to possess exemplary moral character and succeed in passing all requirements for a doctorate within a given time scale, and with the highest possible grades. 
Matura.
In order to achieve the promotio sub auspiciis, one has to acquire "passed with distinction" already at high school: each year of high school, as well as the final exam "Matura", have to be "passed with distinction".
High school lasts four to five years (depending on the type of school), including both prescriptive and elective subjects. These subjects are individually graded as either 
To get "passed with distinction", all subjects must, on average, have received grades 1.5 or better. 
Finally, high school ends with the "Matura", a formalized summative assessment which is graded as follows:
Diploma or Bachelor/Master.
In Austria a diploma curriculum is divided into several (usually two or three) parts. All parts end with diploma examinations. In order to make it possible to get the promotio sub auspiciis each grade in each of these diplomas has to be best possible (which usually is the grade 1). Moreover, the degree has to be completed within the average studying time.
The requirements are the same for bachelor and master degrees: all grades have to be best possible.
Ph.D..
The Austrian doctoral degree depends on a Ph.D. thesis ("Doktorarbeit") and an oral examination ("Rigorosum"). For the promotio sub auspiciis, both have to be rated with 1 and "passed with distinction" has to be given.
Note that there are no Latin honors like in Germany associated with this degree.
Other.
In Austria, approximately 20 out of 2500 students graduate as "sub auspiciis" per year, resulting in just 1042 of such graduations between 1952 and 2012.
The Austrian Astrophysicist Lisa Kalteneggergraduated "sub auspiciis" in 2005

Construction and development began in the late 2000s (Although the town had been trying to get a golf course well before then). The golf course was the creation of Ben Cowan-Dewar, a Toronto-born 33-year old, with the financial backing from Mike Keiser. Mike Keiser was the creator of Bandon Dunes.
The golf course land also includes a restaurant, a golf shop, hotels and, mid-way through the course, a food and drinks stand.
The golf course has assisted with the rebirth of the Inverness economy, which went into decline after its coal mines closed. It has been successful enough that a second golf course is being planned, called the Cabot Cliffs. Cabot Cliffs is planned to open in 2015.

Chukchansi dialect

Chukchansi (Chuk'chansi) is a dialect of Foothill and Valley Yokuts spoken in and around the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians, in the San Joaquin Valley of California, by the Chukchansi band of Yokuts. As of 2011, there were eight native speakers.
"Chukchansi has no “r” sound and ... two consonants never follow each other."
In May 2012, the Linguistics Department of Fresno State University received a $1 million grant to compile a Chuckchansi dictionary and grammar texts, and to "provide support for scholarships, programs, and efforts to assemble native texts and create a curriculum for teaching the language so it can be brought back into social and ritual use." The five-year grant was provided by the Picayune Rancheria of the Chukchansi Indians from funds generated by the Chukchansi Gold Resort & Casino, and is expected to speed existing volunteer efforts by CSU Fresno faculty to document and teach the language. However, the grant has also been criticized in connection with recent disenrollments of Chuckchansi tribal members.
Recordings of the language were made by Sydney Lamb between 1953-1957. Efforts at documentation of Chukchansi have also been attempted using the Phraselator, a handheld recording device developed for military purposes. "When a person speaks into the device in English, it responds with the Chukchansi translation." However, as of 2007, these devices were too expensive to be widely distributed.
Chukchansi classes have been taught at the elementary school in Coarsegold, CA since 2008. As of 2012, Chukchansi classes are available for children and adults. The Native American Coffee Company's first coffee shop, which opened in Coarsegold in 2012, plans to translate the names of its coffee drinks into Chukchansi.
Preservation of the language has evoked strong feelings. Tribal Chairman Reggie Lewis emphasized the need to "preserve, protect, and revitalize our cultural identity and traditions." One tribal member, who put it more directly, said, "When United States began the genocide of Native American communities, the reason they allowed us to sign our treaties was because we had a language ... Generations of our elders went through drought and atrocities; the core of our language is our identity," adding that she was encouraged by the fact that "non-native speakers in the community come to learn the language."

The designation was first used in British service for the LCVP Mk2s introduced with the two "Fearless" class amphibious transport docks, the role having previously been carried out by the Landing Craft Assault developed during the Second World War. They are manned and operated by 1 Assault Group Royal Marines.
LCVP Mk2.
The LCVP Mk2 was built by the Dorset Yacht Company at Poole during the 1960s. The craft was powered by two Foden diesel engines and could carry 35 fully equipped Royal Marines Commandos or two Land Rovers. Foxtrot 7, one of four carried by HMS "Fearless" (L10), rescued 41 crew members from the burning HMS "Antelope" (F170) on 24 May 1982 during the Falklands War. It is preserved at the Royal Marines Museum, Portsmouth.
The LCVP Mk2 is no longer in service.
LCVP Mk4.
The LCVP Mk4 came into service in 1986 replacing the older LCVP Mk2. Throughout their service they were mostly used in independent Royal Marine amphibious formations. They hd a draught of 75cms at the stern and were powered by twin Perkins 6 cylinder turbo diesel engines Four were used by the British Army's Royal Logistics Corps.
As of 2012, it appears the LCVP Mk4 has been withdrawn from service.
LCVP Mk5.
The LCVP Mk5 was built by Vosper Thornycroft and FBM Babcock Marine, with the first entering service in 1996. They represent a significant improvement in capability over the preceding Mk4s. Four of the vessels can transport a full Royal Marine company (around 140 troops). presently, the Mk5s operate from the amphibious warfare ships HMS "Ocean" (L12), HMS "Albion" (L14) and HMS "Bulwark" (L15).
In 2012, a total of 23 Mk5s were in service with pennants 9473, 9673 to 9676 and 9707 to 9724. However by 2014, LCVPs 9473, 9673, 9674 and 9708 have been withdrawn from service.

SCP – Containment Breach

SCP – Containment Breach is an indie supernatural horror video game developed by Joonas Rikkonen ("Regalis"). It is based on the "stories" of the SCP Foundation website.
Gameplay.
The main objective is to guide D-9341, a test subject, through the facility while trying to survive any hazards you come across. The game's main feature is the blinking mechanic.
Blinking is a basic mechanic that is measured by the blink bar in the HUD. It is important to keep in mind when encountering SCP-173, a statue that moves at high speeds whenever none are watching it, as with each blink SCP-173 will move closer to the player. The player can blink manually by pressing the spacebar and can also shut their eyes for an extended period of time by holding down the spacebar. This can prove to be useful if encountering SCP-096, a humanoid creature that will chase and kill the player if they view its face.
Decontamination gas appears throughout the game, and also causes the player to blink at a faster rate due to irritation of the eyes. The player should wear a gas mask in order to keep their eyes from burning. While the effects of the gas will wear off, SCP-173 tends to spawn in places where this gas appears.
D-9341 can sprint, crouch, as well as carry an inventory of up to 10 items.
One of the game's primary features is randomly generated rooms. The facility is divided into three areas: the Light Containment, Heavy Containment, and Entrance zones. Each of these areas contain their own specific randomly generated rooms with each zone being separated by a checkpoint area. The player starts off in the Light Containment zone which is used to hold SCPs that pose little threat, and that can be contained easily. The Heavy Containment zone is used to contain SCPs that can pose a much larger threat, and as a result, its pathways are made up of tunnels. The Entrance zone is the highest level of the facility. It's mainly composed of offices and contains all of the exits to the facility.
Along the way, the player can find a wide variety of items. These include a gas mask which can protect your eyes from gas, batteries which can be used to power specific electronics found throughout the facility, keycards ranging from access levels 1 to 5 that can open higher security doors, first aid kits which can heal wounds, an S-Navigator which can be used to navigate the rooms in the facility, a radio that can pick up transmissions on different channels, eyedrops which can slow down your blink timer, and many more.
Plot.
The game revolves around the SCP Foundation, a secret organization dedicated to containing anomalous artifacts and entities that can threaten the normality of our world. At some point before the events of the game, several of the Foundation's sites get broken into forcing many SCPs (the designation given to their contained anomalies) to be relocated to an unspecified site. A task force known as Nine-Tailed Fox is established shortly after to defend this site from any possible breaches in containment.
The player takes the role of D-9341, a Class-D test subject (which are death row inmates who agreed to work for the Foundation in exchange for their freedom after working for them for one month, when in reality, at the end of the month, they were either terminated and replaced with a new set of test subjects or had their memory reset) who is forced along with two other test subjects to perform tests on an entity known as SCP-173, a murderous sculpture which can move at high speeds when unobserved, but cannot move while in a direct line of sight.
During this testing routine, the Foundation begins to lose control of the site's electricity and remote control door system. The lights begin to flicker causing SCP-173 to kill the other two test subjects and escape into the ventilation system. An intercom then announces that several SCPs have breached containment, forcing them to put the site under lockdown. The player must then guide D-9341 around the facility while trying to survive being hunted by SCP-173 and later SCP-106, a ghostly entity resembling an elderly humanoid with the ability to abduct the player to a strange pocket dimension under its control.
As the player wanders through the facility, they begin to discover clues as to what caused the containment breach.
A monitor found in SCP-079's containment chamber reveals that SCP-079 (an artificial intelligence inhabiting an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer) is the cause of the power outage. The monitor shows a conversation between an unknown client and SCP-079, stating that they have given it direct access to the facility's power so that it could "get vengeance on the ones that imprisoned him".
It is unknown as to who gave SCP-079 access, but it is theorized that the Chaos Insurgency, which are an antagonist group to the Foundation, were the ones who gave 079 access with the help of Dr. Maynard, a new doctor at the SCP site who turns out to be an Insurgency spy.
The game currently has 4 different endings. The first one can be reached by heading to the Entrance zone of the facility, going up to the Electrical Center and de-activating the remote door control system. Once the player does this, they can head to SCP-079's containment chamber where it will propose a deal with D-9341. SCP-079 states that if he re-activates the door control system (which allows SCP-079 to control all of the doors in the facility) it will open the doors to Gate B, allowing D-9341 to escape the site. Once the player re-activates it they can access Gate B.
From this point two endings can be reached. Upon entering Gate B a voice over the intercom will state that SCP-682 has broken out and that they are going to detonate the Alpha Warheads in an attempt to destroy it. If the player de-activated the Alpha Warheads (which can be done in the warhead room found in the Heavy Containment zone) before exiting the facility then the detonation will be cancelled and an Apache will shoot down D-9341, killing him.
If the player did not de-activate the warheads then they will be detonated and the explosion will kill D-9341. At the end screen a radio transmission will be heard, as a radio operative from an apache requests the deployment of a task force to scout for remains at ground zero. However, the transmission is cut-off mid sentence as a large roar is heard, indicating that the nuclear blast was unsuccessful in destroying SCP-682.
Alternatively, the player can escape through Gate A. Two endings can be reached here depending on whether or not D-9341 contained SCP-106. If the player has not contained it then SCP-106 will break out at Gate A. A voice over the intercom will authorize the use of the H.I.D. (High Intensity Discharge) Turret to prevent SCP-106 from escaping. D-9341 will use this distraction to escape through a service tunnel, only to be stopped by a group of soldiers warping in front of him. The soldiers will say that D-9341 knows too much to be killed and they will warp him away collapsing the tunnel behind them.
If the player has contained SCP-106, then several task force units will engage D-9341 and command him to halt and announce what he knows. After being taken by the task force units, the game will then end and a recording will play of a report on D-9341. The report mentions D-9341's skills of overcoming hazardous threats that the containment breach produced and classification of D-9341 as an SCP subject is considered. This ending is most likely considered to be breaking the fourth wall. There is also a reference to quicksaves mentioned in the report.
Reception.
The game has received generally positive reviews.
Gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun said "It’s Warehouse 13 without the quips and the quirks but with a lot more panic, screaming and hiding from creatures made of teeth and wire" adding that "it has a fairly weak model and texture at the moment but hopefully it’ll turn into a massive collaboration". Edge Online gave the game a positive review, calling it an "indie title made in the low-end Blitz3D engine that casts a cheap-looking creature", but adding it "somehow manages to be scarier than most recent big-budget horror games combined."
The game was featured on PC Gamer's top 50 best free PC games at the number 22 spot, saying that "Containment Breach’s power is doubled by drawing on the SCP mythos: a set of invented (or are they?) internet stories about horrors and monsters locked up by a shadowy organization."

Lovin' the Ladies

"Lovin' the Ladies" is a 1930 romantic comedy film directed by Melville W. Brown, and starring Richard Dix, Lois Wilson and Allen Kearns. It made a profit of $65,000.
The film's screenplay was adapted by J. Walter Ruben, based on the 1919 Broadway play, "I Love You", which was written by William Le Baron, who produced this film. A younger Richard Dix starred in the play, which was produced by legendary movie cowboy G. M. Anderson.
Plot.
Peter Darby is an electrician sent on a call to the home of wealthy Jimmy Farnsworth. While there, Farnsworth is telling his friend, George Van Horne, that any two people can fall in love, under the right circumstances. When George expresses his skepticism, Jimmy bets him $5,000 that he can prove his contention. George agrees, on the condition that he can choose the two people, to which Jimmy also agrees. For the woman, much to the chagrin of Jimmy, George selects Betty Duncan, a bored socialite acquaintance of the two, who seems much more interested in solitary pursuits than men. When George is seemingly having difficulty deciding on the man, his eyes alight on Peter, who he selects.
Jimmy, eager to win the bet as well as prove his theory, is not content with simply allowing nature to take its course. He approaches Peter and gets him to agree to woo Betty, posing as a member of the upper classes, in exchange for $2,500 and Jimmy's financing of the wooing. When Jimmy takes Peter to be fitted with new clothes suitable for Jimmy's high society circle, Peter meets Joan Bently, a woman whom Jimmy has repeatedly asked to marry him without success. Mistaking her for the target of the bet, Peter becomes excited, but Jimmy fervently corrects him.
Under the pretense of being Jimmy's friend, Peter reluctantly sets about romancing Betty at Jimmy's estate. Jimmy's schemes to help the two to warm up, as he provides flowers, a violinist, and other mood enhancers, such as scenting the parlor with perfume, and leaving a collection of Shelley's poems out. However, Betty is more interested in Brooks, Jimmy's butler. As time goes on, Peter gives in to his strong attraction to Joan. At first believing he is just like all the other blase wealthy idlers of her acquaintance, she warms to him when he reveals his zest for life. Encouraged, he reveals his humble status and manages to persuade her to leave with him the next morning. However, when Jimmy tells her that Peter has been romancing Betty, she thinks he is just a lying womanizer. Peter forces Jimmy to admit in front of everyone what had really gone on, then leaves. He is delighted when he finds Joan waiting for him in the taxi.
Reception.
Box Office.
The film made a modest profit of $65,000.
Critical.
In his review of the film, the "New York Times" critic, Mordaunt Hall, gave the film a positive review, praising the acting of the players, and stating, "... what this talking film lacks in spontaneity it atones for in farcical situations. Its idea is unfailing as a comedy-froth, but pleasant enough and nicely acted by goodlooking players."

<doc id="36890786" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36890786" title="Capillary electrochromatography">
Capillary electrochromatography

Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) is a chromatographic technique in which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by electroosmosis. Capillary electrochromatography is a combination of two analytical techniques, High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes on the basis of their mass to charge ratio by passing a high voltage across ends of a capillary tube, which is filled with the analyte. High performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with stationary phase. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and mobile phase lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.
Principle.
Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) combines the principles used in HPLC and CE. The mobile phase is driven across the chromatographic bed using electroosmosis instead of pressure (as in HPLC). Electroosmosis is the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane or any other fluid conduit. Electroosmotic flow is caused by the Coulomb force induced by an electric field on net mobile electric charge in a solution. Under alkaline conditions, the surface silanol groups of the fused silica will become ionised leading to a negatively charged surface. This surface will have a layer of positively charged ions in close proximity which are relatively immobilised. This layer of ions is called the Stern layer. The thickness of the double layer is given by the formula:
Where:
When an electric field is applied to the fluid (usually via electrodes placed at inlets and outlets), the net charge in the electrical double layer is induced to move by the resulting Coulomb force. The resulting flow is termed electroosmotic flow. In CEC positive ions of the electrolyte added along with the analyte accumulate in the electrical double layer of the particles of the column packing on application of an electric field they move towards the cathode and drag the liquid mobile phase with them.
The relationship between the linear velocity u of the liquid in the capillary and the applied electric field is given by the Smoluchowski equation as follows:
Where:
Separation of components in CEC is based on interactions between the stationary phase and differential electrophoretic migration of solutes.
Instrumentation and working.
The basic components of an capillary electrochromatograph are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a packed capillary, electrodes, a high-voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. The capillary is packed with stationary phase. To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample and then returned to the source vial (sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, or siphoning). The migration of the analytes is then initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different migration times in an electropherogram.
Advantages.
Avoiding the use of pressure to introduce the mobile phase into the column, results in a number of important advantages. Firstly, the pressure driven flow rate across a column depends directly on the square of the particle diameter and inversely on the length of the column. This restricts the length of the column and size of the particle, particle size is seldom less than 3 micrometer and the length of the column is restricted to 25 cm. Electrically driven flow rate is independent of length of column and size .A second advantage of using electroosmosis to pass the mobile phase into the column is the plug like flow velocity profile of EOF reduces the solute dispersion in the column, increasing column efficiency.

Federico Visconti

Fedrico Visconti (1617–1693) was an Italian Cardinal and Archbishop of Milan from 1681 to 1693.
Early life.
Fedrico Visconti was born in Milan on 4 December 1617, to count Carlo of the House of Visconti, last of six brothers. He studied in the College of Brera in Milan and later he was admitted at the Collegio Borromeo in Pavia and graduated in law at the University of Bologna. Advised by his uncle Francesco Borromeo, bishop of Cremona, he entered in the clerical state and moved to Rome. However he soon returned to Milan, where he served as diocesan priest. In 1644 he became a lawyer, from 1646 to 1662 he was "primicerio" (third position of the chapter of the Cathedral of Milan), from 1651 to 1652 prefect of Biblioteca Ambrosiana.
In 1658 he was sent to Rome by the chapter of the Cathedral, where Pope Alexander VII appointed him referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature. Entered in the administration of the Papal States, he served as governor of Tivoli, Città di Castello and Montalto. Returned in 1667 to Rome, he became as "auditor" (judge) of the Roman Rota, a office he held until 1681.
Archbishop of Milan.
On 23 June 1681 Federico Visconti was appointed Archbishop of Milan. He was consecrated bishop on 10 August 1681 in Rome by the hands of Cardinal Gasparo di Carpegna. On 1 September of the same year he was appointed Cardinal Priest of Santi Bonifacio e Alessio, and he made his solemn entrance in Milan as Archbishop on next 11 January 1682.
Federico Visconti was a typical bishop shaped by the Counter-Reformation. He took very seriously his service, condemned the licentious uses of the population and fought the Protestantism in Valtellina, erecting a sanctuary in Lezzeno and forbidding almost any contact to the population with the Protestant soldiers who passed throughout North Italy.
Following the example of Saint Charles Borromeo, he visited, from 1682 to 1689, all the 67 pieves which composed the large diocese, and in September 1687 he celebrated the 37th diocesan synod.
Federico Visconti maintained good relations with the Spanish government (who ruled the Duchy of Milan), and with this aim he waived the right of asylum in the churches for the deserters, and he asked the population to support with offerings the Battle of Vienna against the Ottoman Empire.
He participated in the Conclaves of 1689 and 1691, but he was forced due an illness to left the Conclave before the election of the pope. He died in Milan on 7 January 1693, and his remains were buried in the North nave of the Cathedral of Milan.

You Can't Buy Luck

"You Can't Buy Luck" is a 1937 murder mystery film. It made a profit of $24,000.
Plot.
Superstitious New York gambler Joe Baldwin (Onslow Stevens), owner of the thoroughbred racing horse Sarcasm, believes that luck can be bought with charitable deeds. Before the Kentucky Derby, to "buy luck," he finances an expensive trip to Europe for gold-digger Jean Jason, his "good luck charm," not knowing she is taking her lover with her, gigolo and sometime artist Paul Vinette (Vinton Hayworth). He also gives his old friend Frank Brent cash to save his cab business and visits an orphanage in Louisville with his sister, where he meets Betty McKay (Helen Mack), a pretty teacher who scoffs at his philosophy. 
She scolds him for wishing for rain on the day of the Derby to aid his horse, who runs best on a muddy track, because the orphans plan an outdoor party. Although it rains as wished, Sarcasm loses the Derby, and Joe is convinced that it was because the orphans were pulling against him. In an attempt to repair the damage before the Preakness, Joe throws the orphans a lavish party, hiring clowns and other entertainment. To Betty's surprise, Joe is as excited as the children, and they fall in love. 
After Sarcasm wins the Preakness, Joe returns to New York, where Jean is back from Europe. Joe tells her that he will not be seeing her any more because he is going to marry Betty, and she cajoles $50,000 from him as a final "luck insurance" payment. Before Joe shows up with the check, however, Paul arrives at Jean's apartment. They argue when he sees that she plans to run out on him with the money. Jean threatens him with a gun, and during a scuffle, kills her. 
Joe arrives at Jean's building, where Paul is waiting outside. He lights the unsuspecting Joe's cigarette and gives him the matchbook, then telephones the police and, posing as Joe, "confesses" that he just murdered Jean. Joe is tried for Jean's murder and convicted on circumstantial evidence, but escapes before his final lockup. Using Frank's cab to get around, and with the help of Betty to question the many possible suspects, Joe tracks down Paul using the passenger lists of Jean's voyage. 
Paul discovers the ploy and has Joe apprehended. Joe convinces the police to question Paul. By matching partial fingerprints from the crime scene to those left by Paul at the police station, Paul is implicated in the murder and confesses. Sure now that luck cannot be bought, Joe embraces Betty.

Conditional noble

A conditional noble or predialist (, ) was a landowner in the Kingdom of Hungary who was obliged to render specific services to his lord in return for his landholding, in contrast with a "true nobleman of the realm" who held his estates free of such services. Most conditional nobles lived in the border territories of the kingdom, including Slavonia and Transylvania, but some of their groups possessed lands in estates of Roman Catholic prelates. Certain groups of conditional nobility, including the "ecclesiastic nobles" and the "nobles of Turopolje" preserved their specific status until the 19th century.
History.
Society in the early medieval Kingdom of Hungary was basically split into the two major groups: "freemen" "(liberi)" and "servants" "(servi)". Although legislation sharply distinguished these two categories (for instance, by prohibiting intermarriage), a wide group of "semi-free" people also existed. Furthermore, a man's legal status did not determine his economic position or occupation. Accordingly, it was not unusual for a freemen to serve in a lord's household without owning landed property nor for a servant to render military services to his lord in return for the lands he had received from him. 
Distinctions between freemen and servants startd to disappear in the 12th century, but in the early 13th century new borders were formed between those who rendered military services and those who only "did peasant work" (Pál Engel) . In the former group, "castle warriors" were those who served under the command of the "ispán" or head of a castle district in return for the lands they held in the royal estates attached to the castle, while "royal servants" were those who owed military service directly to the monarch. Royal servants enforced the confirmation of their liberties in 1222 when King Andrew II of Hungary issued his Golden Bull. One of the principal provisions of the document stipulated that royal servants were no longer obliged to accompany the king in a military campaign abroad "unless it be at his expense".
The emerging self-consciousness of the royal servants is demonstrated by their adoption of the "noble" denomination from the 1250s, in a period when the "exact nature of noble status and the basic privileges of the noble order were definitely laid down" (Pál Engel). Their newly confirmed status distinguished "true nobleman of the realm" from those who owned their estates in return for services to be rendered to the monarch or other lords. On the other hand, some groups of castle warriors began to call themselves "the freemen of the Holy King" "(liberi Sancti Regis)", suggesting that their liberties could be traced back to the time of St Stephen, the first king of Hungary Furthermore, certain groups of landowners who were obliged to render services to their lords received collective liberties in the second half of the 13th century. Even new groups of landowners with similar obligations appeared in the northern Carpathian regions and other border territories of the kingdom in the same period or some decades later.
The "nobility" of conditional nobles was rather local, which is demonstrated by such denominations as "nobles of Turóc" (Turiec, Slovakia) or "nobles of Szepes" (Spiš, Slovakia) (Martyn Rady). Accordingly, they usually had their own administrative units, local meetings and courts, separate from the counties and their general assemblies. For instance, the "predialists" of the archbishopric of Esztergom had a "seat" in Vajka (Vojka nad Dunajom, Slovakia) and later in Verebély (Vráble, Slovakia). Although conditional nobles were sometimes invited to the general assemblies, their court cases were usually heard at a separate meeting. For instance, Romanian "kenezes" attended the general meetings of the Transylvanian noblemen, Saxons and Székelys in 1291 and 1355, but otherwise a separate meeting was convoked for them by the deputy of the voivode of Transylvania.
Conditional nobles were legally distinguished from "familiares", that is, from noblemen who served a secular lord or a prelate (usually in exchange for a salary), but preserved their direct connection to the monarch. Nevertheless, in some cases "familiares" resigned from their "true noble" status in order to receive protection from more powerful lords, such as the ancestors of some nobles living on the estates of the bishops of Veszprém. On the other hand, conditional nobles whose estate was liberated from the obligations formerly attached to it acquired the status of "true noblemen".
Groups of conditional nobles.
Ecclesiastic nobles who owned landed property in the estates of the archbishops, bishops and other prelates of the realm emerged as a distinct group in the second half of the 13th century. They primarily owed military service to their lords. Ecclesiastic nobles in Slavonia sometime owned one or more villages, but those north of the river Dráva cultivated their "dwarf-holdings" themselves (Martyn Rady). The institution was abolished by decree in 1853.
The nobles of Turopolje descended from castle warriors Zagreb County in Slavonia acquired special privileges, including the right to elect their judges in the 1270s. They were also exempt from taxation. The "noble castle warriors" of Gorica and Rovišće were granted the right to be heard at the court of the "ispán" of the castle only when the monarch's envoy was also present, but they were to make an annual payment to the same "ispán". The "nobles of Dubica" had to pay an in-kind tax (primarily marten fur) to the prior of the Knights Templar (later of the Knights Hospitaller) who received the county from King Béla IV of Hungary in 1269.
"Sons of noble castle warriors" "(filii iobagionum)" was the denomination of conditional nobles in many counties in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia and the Zakarpattia District of Ukraine), including Bereg (Berehovo, Ukraine), Gömör (Gemer, Slovakia), Sáros (Šariš, Slovakia) and Turóc (Turiec, Slovakia). Some of them were descendants of former border guards of possible Kabar origin, but others descended from udvarniks settled at newly erected castles under King Béla IV with the obligation to render services to the castle. Most of them had merged into the "true nobility" by the middle of the 14th century. In contrast with them, the "ten-lanced nobles of Szepes preserved their special status up until 1804.
Romanian noble "kenezes" also formed a group of conditional nobles, since they were to render exactly specified services to the castles of the lands on which their estate was situated. They owned quite large properties (some of them inhabited by hundreds of peasants), and were organized into self-governing districts. The boyars of Fogaras enjoyed a similar status in the land of Fogaras (Făgăraș, Romania), held as a fief for decades at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries by the princes of Wallachia. Finally, the status of the Orthodox Romanian noble voivodes who held landed property in the estates of the Roman Catholic bishops of Várad (Oradea, Romania) and Transylvania was similar to that of ecclesiastic nobles.

The Nook, Isle of Man

The Nook (Middle English: a corner or recess) is situated on the primary A18 Mountain Road in the parish of Onchan in the Isle of Man between the 37th Milestone road-side marker on the Snaefell Mountain Course and the TT Grandstand on the primary A2 Glencrutchery Road in the town of Douglas.
The Nook along with the nearby Governor's Bridge road junction and hairpin bends is part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1920 for the Isle of Man TT and from 1923 for the Manx Grand Prix Races. The Nook was part of the Clypse Course for the Isle of Man TT races between 1954 and 1959. It is also part of the Willaston Circuit used for cycle racing, classic car racing and used as part of timed special stage for the Rally Isle of Man.
For the 1954 Isle of Man TT races, the approach to Governor's Bridge including "The Nook" corner on the A18 Bemahauge Road was widened to accommodate the re-introduced Sidecar TT on the Clypse Course. The Department of Transport announced a proposal to build a new section of road for the Mountain Course with a link road from The Nook to Governor's Bridge using parts of the pre-existing A18 Bemahague Road. This road widening scheme occurred between February and April 2008 with the removal of trees on the Bemahague Estate which includes Government House, the official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man TT Races and Manx Grand Prix continued to use the original A18 Bemahauge Road that runs parallel to the new link road from The Nook to the "Governor's Dip" for motor-cycle racing.

Timeline of the 2012 North Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 2012 North Indian Ocean cyclone season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated "ARB" by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated "BOB" by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. This timeline includes information that was operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the IMD, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has not been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, and dissipations during the season.
This season, 3 depressions developed out of the low pressure areas and the remnants of former tropical cyclones. 2 of those depressions strengthened into deep depressions, and both of those storms intensified further into Cyclonic Storms. The first depression of the season developed out of the remnants of Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi on October 10, 2012, very late into the 2012 cyclone season, about southeast of Kolkata, West Bengal. The depression brought high winds and heavy rains to much of Bangladesh, causing extensive damage. The storm killed a total of 30 people. On October 23, the second depression of the season formed. It developed out of a persistent low in the Arabian Sea. A day later, the depression became the first cyclonic storm of the season, and was named "Murjan". It became the first storm to impact the Horn of Africa since Bandu in 2010. Overall, Murjan lasted two and a half days before dissipating over Nugaal region in northeastern Somalia. Only two days later, the third depression of the season formed in southern Bay of Bengal. It eventually strengthened into Cyclonic Storm Nilam, and it made landfall over Southern India early on October 31. Moving further inland, the storm affected two states and caused widespread flooding. Thereafter, Nilam weakened gradually and dissipated on November 2.

He Knew Women

He Knew Women is a 1930 American comedy film, directed by F. Hugh Herbert, from a screenplay by him and William B. Jutte, which was adapted from S. N. Behrman's 1927 play, "The Second Man". It starred Lowell Sherman and Alice Joyce, in her second to last film role. The film just broke even.
Plot.
Geoffrey Clarke is a poor poet, who has his eyes on the fortune of a rich widow, Alice Frayne, in order to keep him in the lifestyle he feels he deserves. Geoffrey is pursued, however, by the young and lovely, yet poor, Monica Grey. Monica, in turn, is pursued by the chemist, Austin Lowe.
When Geoffrey tells Monica that she would be better off with Austin, she is disdainful of the suggestion. Undaunted, he sets the two of them up to have dinner at Geoffrey's apartment. During the dinner, Monica is completely unimpressed with Austin, but when she discovers that Alice has been financially supporting Geoffrey, out of spite she agrees to marry Austin. Regretting her decision, later, when she learns that Alice intends to marry Geoffrey, Monica becomes desperate and falsely accuses Geoffrey in front of the others of having ruined her. This causes Alice to break off her engagement with Geoffrey. However, it has a drastic effect on Austin, who gets a pistol and takes a very poorly aimed shot at Geoffrey. Standing up for her honor causes Monica to re-evaluate her feelings for Austin, and she agrees, this time for real, to marry him. When the falsity of Monica's claim is revealed, Geoffrey and Alice reconcile as well.
Reception.
Variety gave the film a positive review, complimenting the direction of Herbert, as well as the acting of Sherman and Dade, and saying of the overall production: "This is virtually a four-character picture and as near a play transcription for the screen as has been done. Despite all that and the four walls set up around the action, it holds the interest reasonably well, providing a few outstanding kicks."
Notes.
S. N. Behrman's play, "The Second Man", on which this screenplay is based, played from April through September in 1927 at The Guild Theater. It starred Lynn Fontanne and her husband, Alfred Lunt, the Tony Award winning Lunt and Fontanne duo.
A copy of this film is kept at the Library of Congress.

Balthasar Báthory

Balthasar Báthory de Somlyó (; 1560 – 11 September 1594) was a Transylvanian politician from the Báthory family, like his brother, prince Andrew Báthory, opponent of the Habsburgs in Transylvania.
Biography.
Balthasar was born around 1560 in a wealthy and powerful family as son of Hungarian captain Andrew Báthory and his wife Margarita Majláth de Szatmár. Balthasar was raised from a young age with his younger brother Andrew Báthory in Kraków, at the court of his uncle Stephen Báthory, who was King of Poland since 1576.
By the time of his birth, the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into three parts: A western under the control of the Habsburgs (who also had the title of King of Hungary), a central control of the Ottoman Empire, and in the form of oriental Principality of Transylvania, ruled by the Hungarian nobility. Stephen Báthory was not only king of Poland at that time, but earlier, in 1571, was elected Prince of Transylvania, which did not give up title even after leaving for Kraków. Since there, he ruled the two states as regent in Transylvania, leaving his older brother Christopher Báthory. The voivode died in 1581, after which Prince Stephen Báthory himself elected his nephew, the small child, 9-year-old noble: Sigismund Báthory.
Hoping that his family be consolidated into the power, and that the infant reached an older age to govern, Stephen continued to reign until his death in 1586. Sigismund reached the right age to govern itself without guardians in 1588, and that time Balthasar Báthory, when returned to Transylvania, become councilor of his cousin.
Later he joined the opposition of Sándor Kendi (his father-in-law), who refused to attack the Turks, but aimed to reach an amicable solution to the conflict. Unable to allow for this, the Holy Empire decided to extend its influence over Transylvania, to get rid of the faint young Prince. Kendi's opposition strengthened more increasingly by eruption of internal conflicts until May 1594. Balthasar was the responsible for the politics of Transylvania for a short time. In August of that same year, Sigismund regained power, and imprisoned all noble opponents including cousin Balthasar, who was later strangled in his cell.

Denny Sanford Premier Center

The Denny Sanford Premier Center is an indoor arena located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota that is currently under construction. Once completed in 2014, it will have a seating capacity of 12,000 spectators. The facility will be named after title sponsors First Premier Bank and T. Denny Sanford. It will replace Sioux Falls Arena as the main arena in Sioux Falls. The Denny Sanford Premier Center will be located in a parking lot next to the existing Sioux Falls Arena, Sioux Falls Convention Center, Howard Wood Field, and Sioux Falls Stadium. The existing Sioux Falls Arena will remain and will host smaller concerts and events, with the Denny Sanford Premier Center will host large scale concerts and sporting events.
History.
A replacement of the Sioux Falls Arena has been discussed since 1999, with numerous task forces formed and studies completed to determine the need for a new events center. The Sioux Falls Arena was built in 1961 when the population of Sioux Falls was 65,000. By 2000, the population had nearly doubled to 124,000 while updates to the Arena were few and far between. After years of arguments and meetings, the new events center was put to a public vote in a special election on November 8, 2011. By a vote of 23,284 to 16,807, Sioux Falls citizens passed the events center special ballot, allowing design and construction of a new events center to begin.
Events.
Eric Church and Dwight Yoakam will perform at the venue on December 6, 2014 as part of the The Outsiders World Tour.

Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club

The Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club, formerly the Gibraltar Yacht Club, was established by officers of the Royal Navy in 1829. It was one of the first yacht clubs founded outside of Britain. British monarchs and Gibraltarian governors have been patrons of the club; the first visit by a reigning monarch was in 1954. During the latter twentieth century, the naval presence waned and the membership of locals dominated. The club's sailing school was established in 2001, accredited as a teaching facility in 2004, and became a testing centre in 2010. The reclamation projects in the middle section of Gibraltar Harbour necessitated the club's move from 26 Queensway to temporary premises. A new facility is under construction.
History.
The Gibraltar Yacht Club was established in 1829 in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar by officers of the Royal Navy stationed at the garrison. It was one of the first yacht clubs to be founded outside of Britain; the Singapore Yacht Club was established three years earlier. The first mention of a meeting of the club appeared in the "Gibraltar Chronicle" on 15 July 1829: ""The members of the Gibraltar Yacht Club will hold a meeting at Griffiths Hotel on Friday 17th instant at 1 o’ clock p. m. when any officers of the Garrison wishing to join the Club are requested to attend."" The first meeting of the yacht club took place at the Griffiths Hotel in Commercial Square, now referred to as John Mackintosh Square and, colloquially, as the Piazza. Later, gatherings of the membership were at the Garrison Library. At the end of the nineteenth century, the club relocated to Gibraltar Harbour, near King's Bastion. During the late nineteenth century, those who wanted to register their yachts with the Gibraltar Yacht Club required approval of the Governor of Gibraltar.
While the earliest records of the yacht club have been lost, the club does have in its custody a notice of 27 October 1837 from the Admiralty to the Governor. In it, a warrant grants the members of the club permission to fly a "St. George’s or White Ensign and a cornet or burgee." A letter of 22 July 1842 then revokes that permission and instead authorizes wearing of the Blue Ensign.
The first regatta for which records exist is that of 22 July 1893. In addition to sailing, the schedule for that day featured swimming, water polo, rowing, and the greasy pole. In 1910, King George V, then the Prince of Wales, gave to the club a cup, now referred to as the King's Cup, for an annual sailing competition. The next year, the prince became the club's patron. More than two decades later, on 13 October 1933, the king bestowed the title "Royal" upon the Gibraltar Yacht Club. The first visit by a reigning monarch was in May 1954, as the then patron Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited the club after arriving in Gibraltar on the royal yacht HMY "Britannia". Prince Philip continues to be a member of the club. Membership in the club during its early years was limited to officers of the Royal Navy, and the Governor of Gibraltar was consistently one of its patrons. Other amusements afforded to the officers included the Royal Calpe Hunt and the Garrison Library. 
Over the course of the nineteenth century, there was a marked increase in the number of yacht clubs in the British Empire. While it was due in part to an increase in wealth of the middle class, the social prestige associated with sailing was a factor, particularly given the association with royalty, and its promotion by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The percentage of Gibraltarians in the yacht club increased slowly during the nineteenth century. However, during the latter part of the twentieth century, as the presence of the Royal Navy waned, the membership of locals increased more substantially. 
January 1991 marked the start of Europa 92, billed as the world's first "around the world rally," the first race of small yachts around the world. During the week prior to the start of the race, the Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club gave all the participants temporary membership privileges and served as the hosting club.
Twenty-first century.
The primary mission of the Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club is to promote sailing in the Gibraltar area. The organisation uses Victory Class yachts and 420s; it has 17 of the Victory Class yachts. Sailors compete for a total of 21 trophies during the course of the season, from May to October. The King's Cup is the most desirable trophy, awarded for the best performance of the season in Victory Class vessels. The United Kingdom's R.A.F. Sailing Association competes annually at the club. The Tango Laser Open is the final club competition of the summer and is held annually. It includes a competition for adults that is also open to non-club members. This draws a large number of competitors from Spain such as the yacht club of La Línea, across the border.
The fifteenth annual Gibraltar Regatta was organised by the Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club and sponsored by Beck's and the Gibraltar Sports and Leisure Authority. The event took place in the Bay of Gibraltar on the weekend of the 29th through 31 July 2011. Participants registered in one of four divisions, with awards given to the first three vessels in each division. An additional award was given to the vessel with the shortest elapsed time in the "Round the Rock" competition. In 2012, the Gibraltar Regatta was held the weekend of the 28th and 29 July. 
The club's sailing academy was founded in May 2001 and, in 2004, it was credentialed by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) as a teaching facility. The Teaching Centre is staffed by volunteers and financially supported by the yacht club. Lessons run from March to November, and are available to both members and nonmembers of the RGYC. Neophytes take a one week introductory course during the summer, with three such weeks available every year. In 2004, the club also became an RYA training facility for powerboating. Six years later, in 2010, the club became an ICC testing centre for both sailing and powerboating. Registrants can earn an International Certificate of Competence.
The eleventh annual Gibraltar Day was held in London on 18 October 2010. The front cover of the twelve page brochure distributed to those attending Gibraltar Day featured a colour photograph of Victory Class vessels of the Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club in the Bay of Gibraltar. The club participated in the 2011 Festival of the Seas, a fundraiser. 
December 2008 represented the last time that club members were able to set sail from the club. In early 2009, sand dredged from the seabed along the east side of Gibraltar was utilised to reclaim land in front of the yacht club. The project has been referred to as the Rooke reclamation or mid-harbour reclamation. The club relocated from 26 Queensway to temporary premises at 2 Queensway after the reclamation. Temporary mooring sites for the club were built behind what had been a Ministry of Defence health facility. The construction company Profield Contractors won the contract to construct a new club house and associated facilities on Coaling Island. In July 2011, it was announced that the government had included £1.5 million in the year's budget for relocation of the club. Their new location on Coaling Island was formerly a Ministry of Defence site for the Boat Squadron. In 2012, the Government of Gibraltar solicited bids for the ""Proposed Marine Works at the New Royal Gibraltar Yacht Club Phase 1, Sea Scouts and Duke of Edinburgh facilities"."

Summer Mortimer

Summer Ashley Mortimer (born April 22, 1993) is a Canadian para-swimmer who initially competed internationally for Team Canada, but as of 2014, switched to the Netherlands national Paralympic team. She has won four World Championship finals, before winning four medals at her first Paralympic Games, 2012 in London—two gold, one silver, and one bronze.
She has a SM10 classification. A high-level swimmer, Summer Mortimer competed in the 2008 Canadian Olympic trials. After a trampolining accident, she retrained as a para-swimmer. She began competing at an international level in 2010, setting multiple world records in the process. In the process of qualifying for the 2012 Paralympics, she broke one of her world records. Competing in six events, she won medals in all four of the individual competitions. Mortimer holds the world record in the S10 50 m Freestyle Long Course, and in the S10 100 m Freestyle Long Course, 100-metre backstroke, 50-metre and 200-metre backstroke. In 2013, she applied for the Netherlands national team, announcing her transferal in June 2014.
Career.
Swimming.
Daughter of Craig and Janice, she began swimming at age 2; Janice is co-owner of Oakville Swim Academy. At age nine, she began to swim competitively. As a member of the Hamilton Aquatic Club and Golden Horseshoe Aquatic Club, she was competing at a level high enough to participate in the 2008 Canadian Olympic trials for Beijing.
Para-swimming for Canada.
A serious injury while at a competitive trampolining event shattered the majority of bones in her feet; she was nationally ranked in the sport. As soon as she had recovered from her trampoline injury enough to begin trying to walk again, she began to relearn swimming.
Unaware the Worlds were a broadcast event, Mortimer was caught by surprise, and spontaneously stuck her tongue out at the camera. Her relaxed attitude continued at the Olympics, at which point she clarified that there may be "some underlying arrogance", she isn't consciously trying to send a message to others in her class. She wears an elastic band that she snaps, when thinking a negative thought; being "incredibly hard on myself", it helps her realize the frequency of times she thinks "down", in an effort to change her mental perspective.
As a former able-bodied competitive swimmer, she's annoyed by notions from some able-bodied swimmers that Paralympic swimming is a "joke". "The Paralympics are so much harder than the able-bodied side of sport. I know from first hand. It's way harder." She says she knows "truckloads of able-bodied athletes who constantly make fun of the Paralympics." She is optimistic of an attitude change, citing how much fellow medalist Benoit Huot has seen change since his first Paralympics, Sydney 2000.
World level competitions.
At the 2010 IPC Swimming World Championships, in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Mortimer won four gold medals and set five world records. In November that year, she won female Para-swimmer of the year, at Swimming Canada's The Big Splash.
At the 2012 Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Swimming Trials in Montreal in April, Mortimer aimed to lowered her world record in the 50 freestyle, from 28.30 seconds to somewhere near 28.27 seconds; she reached 28.17.
Between qualifiers and the Paralympics, she won the 100 metre backstroke in July at the Canada Cup. The result surprised Mortimer, having had a "rough time" with her feet the previous month. Mortimer was the winner in the women's 100m S10 at the Speedo Para-swimming CANAM in Winnipeg, also in July.
2012 London.
In all, Summer Mortimer was qualified to compete in six events at the 2012 London Paralympics: Women's 200m Ind. Medley – SM10, Women's 4x100m Freestyle Relay – 34 Points, Women's 4x100m Medley Relay – 34 Points, Women's 50m Freestyle – S10, Women's 100m Freestyle – S10, and Women's 100m Backstroke – S10. Going in, there was expectation that she would return as one of the most decorated Paralympians.
The first day of the competition, August 30, Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand won the 200 m individual medley SM10, Mortimer winning silver. For a half-hour before competition, Mortimer was "bauling her eyes out"; she told The Canadian Press that " here and meeting all these people made me realize I am so incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had as a result of my accident. I don’t know if this was part of the journey I was supposed to walk in life but I wouldn’t take it back for the world. On August 31, Mortimer won the gold in the S10 50-metre freestyle in 28.10 seconds. The performance was .07 faster than her previous record in April at the trials, .14 ahead of Pascoe. She recounted going into the race "a bit annoyed", "mad at anyone who was going to take it from me."
In the preliminaries for the Women's 100 metre backstroke S10, Mortimer placed third, hoping to be placed in a lane where she'd be apart from "the main people" in the finals, in an attempt to maintain focus. Mortimer won the gold in the finals on September 4. In the process, she set a new world record of 1 minute, 5.90 seconds. New Zealand's Sophie Pasco led at the turn, with a half-second advantage. Mortimer noted that the time beat her able-bodied times.
In the Women's 100m Freestyle S10, Mortimer finished third with +0.69, her final solo event. The event's gold and silver went to Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand and Elodie Lorandi, respectively. Canadian Aurelie Rivard finished fourth. Her bronze was Canada's only medal on day 9 of competition.
As part of the Canada women's 4x100m Freestyle Relay – 34 Point and 4x100m Medley Relay, she failed to earn any additional medallions. While the freestyle relay team clocked 4:38.23, only missing the Canadian record time by 0.22 seconds, set in 2000, they still placed 7th in the finals. Teamed with Katarina Roxon, Morgan Bird, and Brianna Nelson in the medley relay, they finished seventh of seven. Mortimer had a time of 32.35 for the 50 m and 1:06.37 in 100 m, ranking first in her leg.
At London 2012, Mortimer's four medals were the most of any Canadian athlete or para-athlete.
Post London.
After her final individual event at London 2012, she said that she intended to try for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, the 2015 Parapan American Games, and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro, but notes that she takes life year-by-year. From at least October 2012 to April 2013, she was taking time off to focus on her health.
Mortimer appeared in the Olympic Heroes Parade in Toronto. For the event, Paralympic athletes were given rooms at a hotel on the outskirts of Toronto, while Olympic athletes were put up downtown and given gifts. At a dinner event, they were relegated to another dining room. A Canadian Paralympic Committee spokesperson told "The Spectator" that they scrambled during the Paralympics to even get their athletes involved, and that given their limited funding, they could afford to provide the perks the Olympic athletes received.
She is a 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games ambassador, and has spoken at schools in this role. She receives an honorarium for these appearances, and hopes perhaps to land $3000 worth of speaking fees in 2012. She appeared live on CBC's "Play On! Street Hockey Championship" in Niagara Falls, assisting with the post-position draw at the Pattison Canadian International Championship Stakes, and in publicity photo shoots.
Competitive swimwear maker Arena sponsors Mortimer. In November 2012, Mortimer went public with her and her uncle's inability to find sponsorship, since beginning to attempt procurement since the 2010 Worlds. She pointed out that Paralympic athletes received no prize money, despite the thousands given by the government to winning Olympians and their coaches. Mortimer told "The Hamilton Spectator": "We get a pat on the back and a good job note from Stephen Harper. It's upsetting. Trust me, coming from being an able-bodied athlete to a Paralympian, it infuriates me." She receives just $3000 a year in funding from the government.
Para-swimming for the Netherlands.
In 2013, Mortimer applied to switch to the Netherlands national team; she has dual passports, as her mother is from the country. In June 2014, "Hamilton Spectator" revealed the switch. While day-to-day funding in the Netherlands is similar to funding in Canada, the country offers prize money; in the 2012 Paralympics, she would have won $60,000 for her gold medals alone. She will train in Amersfoort.
Awards.
The Big Splash (from Swimming Canada)
Ontario Sport Award (from Sport Alliance Ontario)
Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012)
She was one of three nominated for the 2013 Golden Horseshoe Athlete of the Year, for residents of Hamilton or Burlington, versus Melissa Tancredi and Cory Conacher, Tancredi won. Columnist Dave Feschuk of the "Toronto Star" listed Mortimer as a contender for the 2012 Lou Marsh Award.
Personal life.
In November 2008, shortly after not qualifying for the Olympics trampoline, 15-year-old Mortimer missed the sponge pit when bouncing on a mini-trampoline, falling 15 feet down onto a concrete pad. Mortimer's parents were watching in the audience at the competition, seeing her injury as it happened. The bones in Mortimer's feet were shattered, doctors suggested she would never stand again, and that amputation was likely. Mortimer was only made aware of the amputation possibility in 2011.
She spent six months in a wheelchair, and 18 months on crutches. Her right foot includes six screws and a plate, her left foot includes two screws; her ankles are continuously sore and sometimes lock up. Talking to The Canadian Press during the Paralympics, she noted that her feet were "killing" her. Her condition is degenerative. Her walking rehabilitation once out of the cast was in the water; she feels she wouldn't be able to walk if not for the water.
Her disability is generally not evident to spectators; the Canadian Press suggests that she walks with a "halfway normal gait."
"Sportsnet Magazine" chose Mortimer as one of their athletes for the 2013 "Beauty of Sport" edition, photographed in Las Vegas in a bikini. She hopes readers will become interested in Paralympic sport, and celebrate all athletes bodies.
As an artist, Mortimer illustrated "The Night I Met the Boogie Man", written by her twin sister, Julia Mortimer, has created murals and artwork for a fundraiser in benefit of Olympic and Paralympic athletes.
She is a graduate of Westmount Secondary School.

Nang Ta-khian

Nang Ta-khian (; "Lady of Ta-khian") is a female spirit of the folklore of Thailand. It manifests itself as a woman that haunts "Hopea odorata" trees. These are very large trees known as "Ta-khian" (ตะเคียน) in Thai, hence her name.
Legends.
The Nang Ta-khian belong to a type of spirits or fairies related to trees and known generically in Thai folklore as "Nang Mai" (นางไม้; "Lady of the Tree"). 
Legends in the Thai oral tradition say the spirit inhabits a Ta-khian tree and sometimes appears as a beautiful young woman wearing traditional Thai attire. It is generally a sylvan spirit, for the Ta-khian is a tall forest tree not naturally found near inhabited areas. As it has a large trunk and a wide-spreading root system, it is not planted close to homesteads.
In some parts of Thailand, the spirit has become a popular tree deity. Miracles are attributed to her power and trunks where lengths of colored silk are tied as an offering are an object of pilgrimage.
The tree is almost never felled for lumber, since the spirit will be furious and follow the wood. About the only place Ta-khian is used as lumber is in a Buddhist monastery, where the merit of the monks is considered sufficient to render the spirit harmless.
Modern adaptations.
This folk spirit is featured in the 2003 Thai film Ta-khian ("The Haunted Tree"), with Sorapong Chatree and 2010 movie Nang Ta-khian ("Takien: The Haunted Tree"). Nang Ta-khian has a role as well in the Nak animated movie.

<doc id="36891149" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36891149" title="Walthamstow by-election, 1910">
Walthamstow by-election, 1910

The Walthamstow by-election, 1910 was a parliamentary by-election held in England on 1 November 1910 for the House of Commons constituency of Walthamstow. It was then a division of Essex, but the area is now part of Greater London.
This was a ministerial by-election. The laws of the time required that an MP who had joined the government had to seek re-election, and the early stages of the campaign saw controversy about whether the election should be contested. However, the main issue in the election was the Osborne judgment, in which the courts had banned trade unions from imposing a political levy on their members. After a prolonged campaign, the outgoing Liberal MP John Simon was re-elected.
Vacancy.
The Liberal Party politician John Simon KC had been Walthamstow's Member of Parliament (MP) since 1906. He was appointed on 6 October 1910 as Solicitor General for England and Wales.
Provisions of the Regency Act 1707, which remained in force until amended in 1919 and repealed in 1926, provided that MPs appointed as ministers automatically vacated their seats in Parliament. They were then allowed to stand for re-election, in what were known as ministerial by-elections,
which were not usually contested by the other major parties.
"The Times" newspaper noted that the relevant Act had been passed in the reign of Queen Anne "to prevent the Court from swamping the House of Commons with placemen and pensioners", and described the process as "anomalous" and "indefensible" in the 20th century.
Choice of polling day.
There was some uncertainty in the constituency as to the procedure for elections when a seat was vacated during a parliamentary recess, when the writ could not be moved in the Commons in the usual way.
However, on 11 October "The Times" newspaper explained that the Speaker could not issue a writ of election until he had received a certificate signed by two MPs declaring that the member in question had accepted an office of profit under the crown, accompanied by a copy of the issue of the "London Gazette" in which the appointment was announced. Those formalities had already been complied with, the appointment having been gazetted on 6 October, and an election was expected before the recess ended.
On 14 October, the "London Gazette" carried the required notice from the Speaker, giving 6 days warning of his intention to issue a writ for the by-election.
On the 17th, the High Sheriff of Essex decided that polling would take place on Thursday 1 November.
The decision was formally announced on 21 October, when the date for nominations was set at 25 October.
The Liberals had preferred Saturday 29th, which would have been more convenient for commuters, whereas the Conservatives pointed out that Saturday was inconvenient for tradesmen.
This led to the Conservative candidate being heckled at public meetings, because a mid-week election would favour the Conservatives, and a public squabble developed between the two candidates. The Liberal agent swore an affidavit alleging that in negotiations with the High Sheriff over polling dates the Conservatives has repudiated an earlier agreement on Saturday polling, and on 30 October the Conservative candidate responded by releasing all the correspondence.
Candidates.
Ministers forced to seek re-election were often unopposed, as had happened at Reading earlier that year when Simon's predecessor Rufus Isaacs had been returned unopposed after his appointment as Solicitor General.
Some senior members local Conservatives wanted to follow the example set in Reading,
but on 8 October a majority of the local party selected as their candidate 41-year-old Stanley Johnson, who had been Simon's opponent at the last general election, in January 1910.
Johnson was a solicitor in the firm of Downer and Johnson, based in London Wall, and had been a member of Hackney Council for 9 years. He described his first priorities for the campaign as being support for the Osborne judgment, a case brought by a Walthamstow trade unionist which restricted the ability of unions to impose a political levy on their members. 
He also stressed his opposition to the payment of MPs, and proclaimed himself a "whole hogger" for tariff reform.
The Liberal candidate, 37-year-old Simon, was a barrister who had risen fast in politics. The son of a Congregationalist minister in Bath,
he was educated at Fettes College and then at Wadham College, before becoming a Fellow of All Souls. In 1903 he had been the British government's counsel in the Alaska boundary dispute, and he entered the Commons in 1906 at the age of 33, making a strong impression with his speeches. He became a Kings Counsel in 1908, at the unusually young age of 35, and developed a large practice, serving as standing counsel to the University of Oxford. At the time of the election, he was a widower with three children.
The constituency.
Walthamstow in 1910 was a very different area to when the constituency was created in 1885. The expansion of London had transformed it from a rural area of Essex to a mostly urban suburb of the capital. Brick-fields and market gardens had been replaced by rows of terraced houses for the 10,000 commuters who travelled each morning on the Great Eastern Railway from Hoe Street station to Liverpool Street station in London.
Constituency boundaries had not been revised since 1885, so this growth had left Walthamstow's electorate one of the largest in England. The number of voters had nearly quadrupled, from 11,233 in 1885 to 39,117 in 1910;
more people voted for the losing candidate in January 1910 than were on the electoral register in 1892. By contrast, the rural Saffron Walden division of Essex had seen its electorate fall slightly below the total of 9,306 who registered in 1885.
The dominance of commuting voters forced candidates to adopt a different style of campaigning than was usual elsewhere in England. In rural areas, candidates held meetings on village greens or at market fairs, while in industrial areas they held midday meetings at factory gates or at the pitheads. Neither approach was viable in Walthamstow, where electioneering took place in the evenings after the commuters had returned.
There remained a few agricultural workers at the Woodford end of the constituency, and some middle-class areas on the borders of Epping Forest, near Leytonstone and Woodford, but the electorate was mostly urban and working class. There were some poor districts in Walthamstow, but no slums. The working-class voters were well-housed, but mostly lived almost hand-to-mouth. House rents were quoted weekly, and most of the furniture was also rented. Tenure in these homes appears to have been short: during the by-election campaign, it was reported that 12,000 of the 39,000 voters had moved house since the electoral register was compiled in July 1909.
The reforms of 1885 had nearly doubled the number of people entitled to vote, but still fell a long way short of universal suffrage. Voting was subject to a property qualification which excluded 40% of adult men, and no women were allowed to vote until 1918.
The issues.
The electoral register had not been revised since the general election in January, but the issues had changed.
The controversy over the People's Budget was expected to remain a hot topic in the campaign, but the proposal to remove the veto power of the House of Lords had been taken to a constitutional conference in June in an attempt to find a compromise, 
removing it from the current debate. The new issue was the Osborne judgment.
Osborne himself was a porter at Clapton railway station, and secretary of the Walthamstow branch of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. He was a member of the local Liberal Association and had supported Simon at the last two elections.
The political funds run the unions had been used to pay a wage to Labour Members of Parliament, who at that time received no salary. Osborne and his colleagues in the Trade Union Political Freedom League wanted to end what they called the "barrier of Socialism" in trade unions, to allow political freedom to trade unionists who were Liberals or Conservatives. He supported the idea of paying MPs a salary, as an alternative to their funding by unions.
The campaign.
Simon's election address was issued on 10 October.
It consisted of only three paragraphs, which explained why he was seeking re-election, but included no statement of either his own political views or the programme of the government that he had just joined. He explained that omission in the second paragraph:
In January-last, after a long and arduous contest, you for the second time returned me by a large majority to the House of Commons. The views which I expressed then I still hold. These views are well known to you; and inasmuch as I am now appealing, after so short an interval, to precisely the same voters, you will not expect me in this document to set forth at length my political opinions.
The campaign began the same day, and "The Times" noted that the Liberals were better prepared. Both candidates held public meetings, and Simon's meeting at Woodford was chaired by the Conservative Andrew Johnson, who disapproved of the opposition to a ministerial re-election and quoted the vicar of Woodford as saying that the infliction of the contest was "hardly fair". On 13 October, "The Times" published a letter from the vicar of Walthamstow, H. D. Hampden, who regretted that a contest had been forced. Hampden wrote that Simon had made no enemies in the constituency, and that the by-election could have been a chance to thank the MP for his work rather than putting him to the trouble and expense of an election.
The following day, "The Times" published a letter from the vicar of Woodford, Henry Sanders, who supported Hampden, and said that opposition to the "futility of these needless and wasteful by-elections" was shared across supporters of all parties.
At that meeting in Woodford, and later in the day at Walthamstow, Simon noted that the Osborne judgment was "a kind of Walthamstow product" and that it was natural for it to be a concern during the election. He explained that as a law officer he could not speak freely on what would be done about the case, but defended his constituent Osborne as "a real trade unionist". He said that his main concern was that "the path to Parliament should be open to men without the distinction of class or income", and that it would not be right for any Liberal government to leave the matter unsettled.
In his election address, Johnson supported the Osborne judgment's ban on a political levy, saying that the union's "point of unity is not on political, but on industrial questions". He said that the ruling "secures the Imperial Parliament against the entering into it of men pledged actually or by implication to vote as ordered by more or less secret bodies by whom they are supported", and pledged "no compromise" in upholding it. He also opposed the payment of MPs.
On 12 October, Simon criticised Conservative politicians who claimed to support the entry of working-class people to Parliament, but seemed content that they had the right to enter, without removing the obstacles in their path. The same day, Johnson responded to criticism of his decision to contest the election, saying that the Osborne judgment was an important matter of domestic politics which had arisen in that constituency, and that as an industrial community they should have a chance of deciding on it.
Trade union and suffragist interventions.
Walthamstow trade unionists met on 14 October with the local branches of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Social Democratic Federation, to discuss the election. The delegates voted by 47 votes to 25 to oppose Simon's re-election unless he promised that a Bill to reverse the Osborne judgment would be introduced in the Commons. A delegation was sent to meet Simon.
The local ILP had already passed a similar motion, and confirmed that they would not accept the payment of MPs as a reversal of the judgment, and a member of the delegation confirmed that they did not seek a declaration from Simon alone, but a pledge from the government that the unions would be allowed absolute control of their own funds.
Meanwhile the Labour Party was preparing a manifesto on trade unions, in which it said that the Osborne judgment was proof that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor; the unions could not do their job unless they had the power to support MPs.
Osborne pronounced himself satisfied with Simon's answers to his questions, and promised his personal support for the Solicitor-General.
The delegation from the Trade Union and Socialist Election Committee met Simon on 19 October, after which he wrote to them, explaining that he was not a member of the Cabinet and could not commit the government.
He repeated his commitment to the payment of MPs, which both the Liberal and Labour parties had voted in 1906, but acknowledged that this might not be a complete solution. He also warned against supporting his opponent, writing that he would "be astonished if workmen in this division were so misled as to vote for 'Tariff and Tories'".
The Committee's response was that the government could have made a substantive response if it had wanted to, and that since it had not done so they would campaign against the government candidate.
Their manifesto, published on 24 October, called for voters to defeat Simon because of his failure to support the overturn of the judgment; but Simon's supporters said that this would make little difference, because these socialists had never voted Liberal.
Further opposition to Simon came from supporters of Women's suffrage (the right to vote in elections). The Women's Social and Political Union, the Women's Freedom League, and the Men's League for Women's Suffrage all advised electors to "keep the Liberal out".
Hundreds of special interest groups organised street-corner meetings, and the suffragists held a procession which included a prisoner on a lorry.
Campaign concludes.
When nominations were submitted on 26 October, there were nearly 100 nomination papers for Johnson, and 126 for Simon.
Simon's papers included one signed wholly by doctors, one from nonconformist ministers, and eight signed by trade unionists.
The committee of trade unionists had hoped that 1,000 or 2,000 voters would follow their recommendation to oppose Simon, but as the campaign concluded it appeared that their only about 200 voters would follow their lead. In the end, both candidates agreed that the dominant issue had been tariff reform; but "The Times" correspondent reported that the campaign had engaged "nobody but the partisan who is always ready for a fight.
The campaign ended on 31 October with mass meetings. A Conservative meeting of 6,000 people at the Walthamstow skating rink was addressed by Lord Charles Beresford, while Russell Rea MP spoke to a crowd of 10,000 at the Liberal meeting in the Walthamstow recreation ground.
Result.
The votes were counted on 2 November, and the result was declared from Walthamstow town hall at 1pm: Simon was re-elected.
The turnout had fallen by almost 9% since the January election, but Simon's majority had increased a little, from 2,195 votes in January to 2,766 in the by-election.
The declaration was followed by speeches from both candidates. The Liberal victory procession that evening was nearly a mile long, as Simon was drawn in an open carriage through the main streets.
Aftermath.
This was the last by-election before Parliament was dissolved on 28 November
for the general election in December 1910. Simon was returned, but Johnson did not contest that election. Johnson became Mayor of Hackney in 1914, and at the 1918 general election he defeated Simon in the newly created Walthamstow East constituency.
Johnson retired from Parliament at the 1924 election, but Simon returned in 1922 as MP for Spen Valley. He went on to become one of only three people to have served as Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, before being ennobled in 1940 as Viscount Simon, when he became Lord Chancellor.

Living on Love

Living on Love (1937) is a feature film released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film is a remake of the RKO film "Rafter Romance" (1933).
Preservation status.
This is one of the "lost RKO films" owned by Merian C. Cooper and only re-released in April 2007 when Turner Classic Movies acquired the rights and showed all six films on TCM. 
Cooper accused RKO of not paying him all the money contractually due for the films he produced in the 1930s. A settlement was reached in 1946, giving Cooper complete ownership of six RKO titles: 
According to an interview with a retired RKO executive, shown as a promo on TCM, Cooper withdrew the films, only allowing them to be shown on television in 1955-1956 in New York City. 
In 2006, Turner Classic Movies, which had acquired the rights to the six films after extensive legal negotiations, broadcast them on TCM in April 2007, their first full public exhibition in over 70 years. TCM, in association with the Library of Congress and the Brigham Young University Motion Picture Archive, had searched many film archives throughout the world to find copies of the films in order to create new 35mm prints.
Reception.
The film recorded a loss of $28,000 in its original release.
