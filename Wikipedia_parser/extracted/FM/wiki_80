Margaret (2009 film)

Margaret is a 2009 television film produced by Great Meadow Productions for the BBC. It is a fictionalisation of the life of Margaret Thatcher (played by Lindsay Duncan) and her fall from the premiership in the 1990 leadership election, with flashbacks telling the story of Thatcher's defeat of Edward Heath in the 1975 leadership election. It was first broadcast on 26 February 2009 on BBC Two. It was made by the same production company as the 2008 television film "The Long Walk to Finchley", which fictionalised the start of Thatcher's political career.
Production.
On 9 April 2008, it was announced that Duncan was to play Thatcher, and filming commenced in summer 2008.
Cast.
Hardy, Fox, Vansittart and Cochrane had all appeared in the 2002 TV production of The Falklands Play, by Ian Curteis, about an earlier period in Thatcher's premiership; although many political figures were featured in both films, none of the four actors played the same roles in both.
Allam and Sessions would go on to appear in the 2011 film "The Iron Lady" about Thatcher's rise to power, relationship with her husband, and life after politics.
Reception.
The "Guardian" critic praised the "deft casting" and stated that the flashbacks were "illuminating and sometimes entertaining" and that some episodes in the drama were "wholly imaginary and thoroughly un-Thatcherite, but ... around the mind like cigar smoke".
Media releases.
It is currently available for purchase in the UK.

Gibb River

The Gibb River is a river in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. 
The headwaters of the river rise between the Caroline and Gibb Ranges. The river flows in a northerly direction until merging with the Drysdale River, of which it is a tributary. Gibb River has three tributaries: North Creek, Plain Creek and Russ Creek.
The Gibb River was named in 1901 by the surveyor Charles Crossland during an expedition in the Kimberley area. It is named after geologist Andrew Gibb Maitland who had accompanied Crossland and was present when the river was first sighted. In turn, it gives its name to the Gibb River Road, a former cattle route that stretches almost 660 kilometres (410 mi) across he Kimberley between the towns of Derby and the Kununurra and Wyndham junction of the Great Northern Highway.
The traditional owners of the area that the river flows through are the Ngarinjin people.

RDLs.
Nicu Vlad is also the reason for which the flat-backed, semi-stiff legged barbell lift (with a form similar to a deadlift) came to be known as the Romanian deadlift.
As the story goes, he was seen by some American lifters doing the deadlifts in the Olympic training hall prior to either winning a medal, setting a world record or both. Since he is Romanian, the exercise got dubbed the Romanian deadlift, and that is the name most people know the exercise by.
As the exercise does not involve lifting the weight off the ground, it is not technically a deadlift, but rather a powerful compound accessory movement that strengthens the same muscles.

__NOTOC__
Nathaniel Rich (born March 5, 1980) is an American novelist and essayist. He is the author of the 2013 novel, "Odds Against Tomorrow", the 2008 novel, "The Mayor's Tongue" and the 2005 nonfiction book, "San Francisco Noir: The City in Film Noir from 1940 to the Present". Rich has written essays and criticism for "The New York Review of Books", "Vanity Fair", "The New York Times Magazine", "Harper's Magazine," "Rolling Stone," and "Slate."
Rich is an alumnus of Yale University, where he studied literature. After graduation he worked on the editorial staff of "The New York Review of Books." He moved to San Francisco to write "San Francisco Noir", which the "San Francisco Chronicle" named one of the best books of 2005. That year he was hired as an editor by "The Paris Review".
"The Mayor's Tongue" was described by Carolyn See in "The Washington Post" as a "playful, highly intellectual novel about serious subjects -- the failure of language, for one, and how we cope with that failure in order to keep ourselves sane." |
NPR's Alan Cheuse called "Odds Against Tomorrow" a "brilliantly conceived and extremely well-executed novel...a knockout of a book." Cathleen Schine wrote, in the New York Review of Books, "Let's just, right away, recognize how prescient this charming, terrifying, comic novel of apocalyptic manners is...Rich is a gifted caricaturist and a gifted apocalyptist. His descriptions of the vagaries of both nature and human nature are stark, fresh, and convincing, full of surprise and recognition as both good comedy and good terror must be."
Rich is the son of "New York Magazine" writer and former "New York Times" columnist Frank Rich, and brother of writer Simon Rich.

Unfaithful (House)

"Unfaithful" is the fifteenth episode of the fifth season of "House". It aired on February 16, 2009.
Plot.
A young priest, Fr. Daniel Bresson (played by Jimmi Simpson), runs a homeless shelter. After he gives a man a sweater to keep warm, Bresson begins drinking at a dangerous rate. He hears a knock at his door and opens it to find an apparition of Jesus Christ hovering a foot off the ground and bleeding.
Cuddy asks House to come to her baby daughter Rachel's simchat bat, a Jewish baby-naming ceremony, and House sarcastically refuses. In the emergency room, House takes the priest's case from Cameron, who tells him there is nothing to diagnose, as Bresson simply drank too much bourbon. House takes the case as a diversion for Kutner and Taub while he confronts Foreman and Thirteen about their relationship. While the team tests Bresson's EEG for epilepsy, House calls Foreman and Thirteen in. He gives them the option to "split or quit," as he feels their relationship is clouding their judgment. He tells them they have until the end of the case to decide.
While performing Bresson's EEG, Taub and Kutner learn more about him. Taub, intrigued by Bresson's frequent job relocation, asks him for an explanation. Bresson admits to having an alleged inappropriate relationship with a teenage boy a few years ago; once that was exposed, no church would keep him. Kutner and Taub report this to House, who declares the case over. During lunch, House and Wilson talk over Cuddy's invitation, and Wilson tries convincing House to go.
Foreman and Thirteen decide to "do nothing." Foreman says that House is just trying to get them to work harder. When they report their decision, House fires Foreman. When Taub and Kutner tell Bresson he is being discharged, he pleads to stay, saying he knows something is wrong. Kutner finds a black toe in Bresson's bed, which fell off his foot. House suspects carbon monoxide poisoning and orders them to put the priest in a hyperbaric chamber. Cuddy again asks House to come to the ceremony, and this time he agrees. Annoyed, she goes to Wilson and asks him to uninvite House, saying she does not want him there and that Wilson prodded him to go.
Bresson suffers an apparent heart attack in the hyperbaric chamber. Foreman asks Cuddy for a letter of recommendation, but she tells him she cannot give it to him because his breach of protocol during the drug trial put the hospital and Cuddy's reputations in jeopardy. House debates Bresson on God and faith while testing his lungs. Kutner apologizes for the pain as he pulls the catheter out, but Bresson says he did not feel pain. House discovers a new symptom: regional anesthesia. House orders a nerve conduction study. 
Taub and Kutner find an intercostal neuralgia affecting a nerve that runs along the ribs. Bresson's right eye loses sight, even though nothing is structurally wrong with it. With his heart rate down, sensory loss and progressive muscle weakness, the patient is shutting down. Based on the absence of white blood cells, House concludes it must be the spleen. Taub and Kutner discover that Bresson has pneumocystis, a parasite he contracted through the church holy water. Pneumocystis is virtually harmless, except to people with compromised immune systems. House concludes that Bresson has AIDS. Bresson tells the team not to test him for AIDS, as he does not believe it is true. 
Thirteen decides to quit in exchange for House offering Foreman his job back, since he cannot find one. Foreman disagrees, thinking he can handle it himself. Foreman asks House for his job behind Thirteen's back. House offers Foreman a decision between Thirteen or his job. He chooses his job. Taub goes to find the boy that Bresson allegedly molested to tell him he should get tested for AIDS. The boy, Ryan, is at first indifferent, but later visits Bresson and cries by his bedside, asking for forgiveness, thus hinting at the falsification of the molestation complaint. Bresson forgives him. Wilson tries to convince House to go to Rachel's ceremony again, saying that 'even if an absolute truth does exist, can't know all of it'. Wilson's comment triggers an epiphany, and after ignoring Bresson's hallucinations, House concludes that Bresson has Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a genetic condition with symptoms that mimic AIDS. 
Cuddy tells Cameron about the patient. Cameron suggests that Cuddy reinvite House to the ceremony, but she fails to do so. House sits in his apartment, drinking and playing the piano. Foreman is reading the paper when Thirteen walks in and smiles, taking a staged "Broadway-esque" bow, hinting at the fact that she and Foreman just played House. She and Foreman kiss. Meanwhile, the ceremony takes place at Cuddy's house.

Andre Hajdu

Andre Hajdu (; born 5 March 1932) is an Israeli composer and ethnomusicologist.
Biography.
Andre Hajdu was born on 5 March 1932 in Hungary.
Andre Hajdu studied at Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest with Endre Szervánszky and Ferenc Szabó (composition), Erno Szégedi (piano), and Zoltán Kodály (ethnomusicology). As a Kodály disciple, he was involved for two years in research about Gypsy musical culture and published several articles on this subject.
After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Hajdu escaped to Paris and continued his studies at the Conservatoire with Darius Milhaud (composition) and Olivier Messiaen (philosophy of music) and obtained the 1st prize in the discipline.
Since 1966, he has been living in Jerusalem. He taught at the Tel Aviv Music Academy from 1966 to 1991 and at Bar-Ilan University since 1970. He served as chairman in the Music Department there and founded a composition department.
He has also studied Jewish Klezmer and Hassidic repertories and published several articles on this subject. As a composer he was and is deeply involved in Jewish topics, not only on the usual folkloristic or liturgical levels, but also confronted more abstract subjects of Jewish thought (Oral Law, philosophical books of the Bible) as well as Jewish History.
A majority of works are dedicated to music-teaching, especially piano and theory through a creative approach (involving the player to the process of composing) e.g. Milky Way, Art of Piano-playing, Book of Challenges, Concerto for 10 young pianists. All this is connected with the practice of creative teaching in the School for Excellence in Jerusalem, an experimental school for a new approach to music teaching.
As an educator, Hajdu, through his devotion to teaching, has nurtured some of the leading talents of Israeli musicians; among his students are many prominent composers, including Gil Shohat, Yonatan Razel, Yoni Rechter, Shem Tov Levi, Matti Kovler and Matan Porat.
Discography.
These compositions were widely played in Israel and abroad by orchestras and ensembles such as

Schmachter See

Schmachter See is a lake near Binz on the German Baltic Sea island of Rügen. It lies within the county of Vorpommern-Rügen in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It has an elevation of 1.1 metres above sea level and its surface area is 1.18 km². It is part of the Schmachter See and Fangerien Nature Reserve. 
The lake has its origins in the Ice Age. At the end of the glacial period there was an ice front here. Today the lake has an area of about 118 hectares. Before about 14,000 years ago the lake, which was then still part of the Baltic Sea, had a depth of up to 15 metres. About 5,000 years ago the waterbody was cut off from the Baltic by the bar of the Schmale Heide. Its only link to the Baltic is the drainage ditch of the Ahlbeck stream. As a result of natural silting-up processes it is today a shallow lake. In the centre it has a depth of only one to two metres. In addition the lake has lost a lot of its former area. Originally it puportedly reached as far south as Nistelitz. The name of the lake comes from the settlement of Schmacht to the southwest, but which no longer lies on the lake shore. The Ahlbeck, which drains the lake into the Baltic Sea, was canalised in the 1950s. The mouth of the pipe or ditch is located on the beach of Binzer Strand and is marked by an information sign.
A variety of animal and plant species live on the lake and, including 40 species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. For example, the Bittern Reed warbler Greylag Goose, Goosander, Smew White-tailed Eagle and Osprey occur here.
The shores of the lake are mainly covered in beech woods. At the foot of the slopes are seepage springs. Close to the lake are alder carrs and marshes. The shore itself is mainly fringed by reeds and quaking bog vegetation. 
At the northern end the lake is the village of Binz. Here, there is a promenade and the "Park of Senses" ("Park der Sinne").
Restoration project.
For many years effluents were discharged into the lake from a since-closed sewage farm. In addition, fertiliser chemicals entered it as a result of agriculture. The lake thus suffered from eutrophication to such an extent that by 1990 the ecology had become unstable. It had caused heavy silting. As part of a project sponsored by the municipality of Binz and the East Rügen Rural Conservation Association ("Landschaftspflegeverband Ostrügen"), 300,000 cubic metres of lake mud will be removed. In addition, phosphorus will be removed from 1.45 million cubic metres of sea water.
After completion of the project, a nutrient-poor, macrophyte-dominated freshwater lake will be created.
In the course of renovation in 2008 piping for the canalised Ahlbeck stream was replaced. A total of 450 metres of iron pipe was laid from the Schmachter See to the seabed of the Baltic.

During the 1950s - and maybe before then and until closure - the morning express from Windermere to London Euston stopped at Crewe at 1:00 p.m., put in a call at Blisworth for a connection to Northampton and to make use of the water tower on the up platform, a further call at Bletchley at 3:15 p.m. and then ran non-stop to Euston.
The station closed on 4 January 1960. and was demolished soon after.

Oscar Peterson and Nelson Riddle

Oscar Peterson and Nelson Riddle is a 1963 album by Oscar Peterson with orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle. The album was produced by Norman Granz and released on Verve Records. 
The album was also reissued in 1984 as "Oscar Peterson: The Silver Collection" with four tracks added that were recorded by his Trio in 1964, "Con Alma", "Maids of Cadiz", "My Heart Stood Still" and "Woody 'n' You", but omitting track two of the recording with Riddle ("Judy").
The original album was remastered and rereleased by Verve in 2009.
Response.
"Billboard" magazine described the album as follows: "A neat teaming of talents here brings Peterson more strongly into the pop area than at any time in the past. Riddle's arrangements blend handsomely with their 10 celli, 5 horn and 5 flute voicings, with Peterson's perhaps underplayed pianistics here. There is, in fact, a kind of Claude Thornhill quality to these proceedings, making for strong mood as well as jazz buyer appeal."
The album was nominated at the 1965 Grammy Awards in the category of Best Instrumental Jazz Performance - Large Group or Soloist with Large Group.

A Scholte wave is a surface wave (interface wave) created by dynamic loads at an interface between a fluid and an elastic solid medium (such as an interface between water and sand). The wave is of maximum intensity at the interface and decreases exponentially away from the interface into both the fluid and the solid medium. It is named after J. G. Scholte who discovered it in 1947. This wave is similar to a Stoneley wave which propagates at a solid-solid interface, and Rayleigh wave which propagates at a vacuum-solid interface.

The Church of the Holy Family (; ) is a neogothic brick church in Kaliningrad. It was built in the Haberberg city district of Königsberg, near the Pregel river, between 1904 and 1907. The Kaliningrad authorities have refused to return the church to the Catholic community.
Architecture.
The church was designed by architect Friedrich Heitmann and was built for the Catholic immigrants that were coming to Königsberg. The church remained largely unharmed during World War II. It was used by the Red Army as a lazaret immediately after the war, and then as a fertilizer depot. In the beginning of the 1980s the church was restored a little, and began to function as the concert hall of the Kaliningrad Philharmonic. This made possible the installation of a new organ, which with its 44 registers and 3,600 pipes became a favourite of even the best organists of the Saint Petersburg music academy. The clock of the Kreuzkirche was placed in the tower.

Stoneley wave

A Stoneley wave is a high-amplitude surface wave (or interface wave) that typically propagates along a solid-solid interface. When found at a liquid-solid interface, this wave is referred to as a Scholte wave. The wave is of maximum intensity at the interface and decreases exponentially away from it. It is named after the British seismologist Dr. Robert Stoneley (1894 - 1976), Emeritus Professor of Seismology at the University of Cambridge, who discovered it in 1924.
Occurrence and Use.
Stoneley waves are most commonly generated during borehole sonic logging and vertical seismic profiling. They propagate along the walls of a fluid-filled borehole. They make up a large part of the low-frequency component of the signal from the seismic source and their attenuation is sensitive to fractures and formation permeability. Therefore, analysis of Stoneley waves can make it possible to estimate these rock properties. The standard data processing of sonic logs to derive wave velocity and energy content is explained in and.
Effects of Permeability on Stoneley Wave Propagation.
Permeability can influence Stoneley wave propagation in three ways. Stoneley waves can be partly reflected at sharp impedance contrasts such as fractures, lithology, or borehole diameter changes. Moreover, as formation permeability increases, Stoneley wave velocity decreases, thereby inducing dispersion. The third effect is the attenuation of Stoneley waves.

Polish resistance in France during World War II

After the fall of France, many Poles who were not involved in the regular Polish Army in France during World War II, or who were unable to reach the United Kingdom where the Polish Army in the United Kingdom had been formed, became the pillars of the Polish resistance in France.
Origin.
That resistance started to organize under the inspiration of Consul General Aleksander Kawałkowski alias Justyn, in agreement with the Polish government in exile in London, helped by an emissary Czesław Bitner. The organization was founded on 6 September 1941, in collaboration with the French Resistance. Its mission was intelligence, sabotage, writing and distribution of underground newspapers in Polish, and burning pro-Nazi German literature, such as newspapers, or biographies of fascism supporters. The ability to parachute consisted of 60 bases in 20 reception in the south, 41 in the North and Center, according to messages sent by the French section of the BBC. Officers, weapons, radio equipment, and explosives were thus parachuted.
The night of 22 to 23 July 1943, when Colonel Daniel Zdrojewski was dropped, marks the birth of the POWN - Polska Organizacja Walki o Niepodległości - Polish Organization for the Struggle for Independence. In 1943, the Organization had 4000 members.
Activities.
Colonel Zdrojewski was Chief of the Polish Military Operations in France. He was in close contact with General Marie-Pierre Koenig, commander in chief of the Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur (FFI). The relationship between the French and Poles, fighting a common enemy, were very friendly. There were Polish companies in the resistance, as part of FFI. The Organization's sophisticated sections included transport and delivery of equipment and men parachuted to their places of destination. Women and young Scouts incumbent liaison missions, intelligence, transport of underground newspapers, leaflets and so on. Intelligence units have sent information on 182 launchers V1 flying bombs and V2 which 162 were bombed by Allied aircraft. The mission of the Sabotage section was to destroy telephone lines and power lines, to draw up barricades on roads, destroy or move telephone poles. Their mission was also to cause or facilitate the desertion of forcibly enlisted Poles from the German army (Wehrmacht) or the Organization Todt. Thus 15 000 of the Wehrmacht and 10 000 from the Organization Todt were removed from the actual German. General Eisenhower felt that the activities of the Resistance was a contribution equivalent to 8 military divisions. The Polish units openly fought the Wehrmacht. The battalion "Lwów" fought in Cantal and Corrèze, "Warsaw" battalion was engaged in the operations of the Isère and the Alps (see Emile Garabiol). In July 1944 one month before the liberation of the Isère, the Polish students of the Lycée of Villard-de-Lans took part in combat against the Germans alongside the French resistance on the plateau of the Vercors. Of the 27 Poles, mostly aged 16 to 19 years, 11 died, as did 2 teachers and the doctor of the school.
Units of the POWN fought alongside FFI in the Departments of the Côte-d'Or, Jura and Saône et Loire. When the contact was established between the Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR) and POWN the battle groups headed by Colonel Zdrojewski were attached to the movement of FFI on the basis of an agreement with Lyon on 28 May 1944 between the General Chaban-Delmas, Chief Military Provisional Government of the Republic of France and General Zdrojewski.
Other Polish resistance groups in France.
POWN was not the only Polish group involved in the Resistance in France. Other resistance groups were similar to those issued by the French Communist Party as the Polish immigrant labor, the MOI. She maintained a correspondence with Fred (Alias Jacques Duclos). The group members of the Polish language MOI were mostly former soldiers of the International Brigades in Spain, Jarosław Dąbrowski Brigade (about 3000 men). The arrival of the POWN in the mining area of Nord Pas de Calais, led to a confrontation between supporters of the Polish government in exile in London and the MOI of the CPF. Poles were also members in the Youth Battalions. They would later became members of the Franc Tireurs Partisans (FTP) after the attack on the USSR by the armies of Hitler in June 1941.
Other units made of foreign Jews were active, with the identity or name "Jews born in Poland." In 1944, they began to train Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) who supported the policy of communism Poland, it was opposed to the POWN under the command of the Polish government in exile in London.
Members of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) (main stream political party in Poland prior to the war) had given birth early in 1941 in the Department du Nord Pas de Calais and two underground organizations, the Organization and S Orzel Bialy (White Eagle). Both organizations were designed to inform the Poles in France on military developments and spread the idea of resistance to the Germans.

3D television

3D television (3DTV) is television that conveys depth perception to the viewer by employing techniques such as stereoscopic display, multi-view display, 2D-plus-depth, or any other form of 3D display. Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses.
According to DisplaySearch, 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45 million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010.
History.
The stereoscope was first invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1838. It showed that when two pictures are viewed stereoscopically, they are combined by the brain to produce 3D depth perception. The stereoscope was improved by Louis Jules Duboscq, and a famous picture of Queen Victoria was displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1855 the Kinematoscope was invented. In the late 1890s, the British film pioneer William Friese-Greene filed a patent for a 3D movie process. On 10 June 1915, Edwin S. Porter and William E. Waddell presented tests in red-green anaglyph to an audience at the Astor Theater in New York City and in 1922 the first public 3D movie "The Power of Love" was displayed.
Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electro-mechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. In 1935 the first 3D color movie was produced. By the Second World War, stereoscopic 3D still cameras for personal use were already fairly common. In the 1950s, when TV became popular in the United States, many 3D movies were produced for cinema. The first such movie was "Bwana Devil" from United Artists that could be seen all across the US in 1952. One year later, in 1953, came the 3D movie "House of Wax" which also featured stereophonic sound. Alfred Hitchcock produced his film "Dial M for Murder" in 3D, but for the purpose of maximizing profits the movie was released in 2D because not all cinemas were able to display 3D films. The Soviet Union also developed 3D films, with "Robinzon Kruzo" being its first full-length 3D movie, in 1946.
Technologies.
There are several techniques to produce and display 3D moving pictures. The following are some of the technical details and methodologies employed in some of the more notable 3D movie systems that have been developed.
The future of 3D television is also emerging as time progresses. New technology like WindowWalls (wall-size displays) and Visible light communication are being implemented into 3D television as the demand for 3D TV increases. Scott Birnbaum, vice president of Samsung's LCD business, says that the demand for 3D TV will skyrocket in the next couple of years, fueled by televised sports. One might be able to obtain information directly onto their television due to new technologies like the Visible Light Communication that allows for this to happen because the LED lights transmit information by flickering at high frequencies.
Displaying technologies.
The basic requirement is to display offset images that are filtered separately to the left and right eye. Two strategies have been used to accomplish this: have the viewer wear eyeglasses to filter the separately offset images to each eye, or have the light source split the images directionally into the viewer's eyes (no glasses required). Common 3D display technology for projecting stereoscopic image pairs to the viewer include:
In a CEATEC 2011 exhibition, Hitachi released glasses-free 3D projection systems that use a set of 24 projectors, lenses, and translucent half mirrors to superimpose 3D images with a horizontal viewing angle of 60 degrees and a vertical viewing angle of 30 degrees. Besides Hitachi, Sony is also working on similar technologies.
Single-view displays project only one stereo pair at a time. Multi-view displays either use head tracking to change the view depending on the viewing angle, or simultaneous projection of multiple independent views of a scene for multiple viewers (automultiscopic). Such multiple views can be created on the fly using the 2D-plus-depth format.
Various other display techniques have been described, such as holography, volumetric display, and the Pulfrich effect; which was used in "Doctor Who" Dimensions in Time, in 1993, by "3rd Rock From The Sun" in 1997, and by the Discovery Channel's "Shark Week" in 2000.
Producing technologies.
Stereoscopy is the most widely accepted method for capturing and delivering 3D video. It involves capturing stereo pairs in a two-view setup, with cameras mounted side by side and separated by the same distance as is between a person's pupils. If we imagine projecting an object point in a scene along the line-of-sight for each eye, in turn; to a flat background screen, we may describe the location of this point mathematically using simple algebra. In rectangular coordinates with the screen lying in the Y-Z plane, with the Z axis upward and the Y axis to the right, with the viewer centered along the X axis; we find that the screen coordinates are simply the sum of two terms. One accounting for perspective and the other for binocular shift. Perspective modifies the Z and Y coordinates of the object point, by a factor of D/(D-x), while binocular shift contributes an additional term (to the Y coordinate only) of s*x/(2*(D-x)), where D is the distance from the selected system origin to the viewer (right between the eyes), s is the eye separation (about 7 centimeters), and x is the true x coordinate of the object point. The binocular shift is positive for the left-eye-view and negative for the right-eye-view. For very distant object points, it is obvious that the eyes will be looking along essentially the same line of sight. For very near objects, the eyes may become excessively "cross-eyed". However, for scenes in the greater portion of the field of view, a realistic image is readily achieved by superposition of the left and right images (using the polarization method or synchronized shutter-lens method) provided the viewer is not too near the screen and the left and right images are correctly positioned on the screen. Digital technology has largely eliminated inaccurate superposition that was a common problem during the era of traditional stereoscopic films.
Multi-view capture uses arrays of many cameras to capture a 3D scene through multiple independent video streams. Plenoptic cameras, which capture the light field of a scene, can also be used to capture multiple views with a single main lens. Depending on the camera setup, the resulting views can either be displayed on multi-view displays, or passed along for further image processing.
After capture, stereo or multi-view image data can be processed to extract 2D plus depth information for each view, effectively creating a device-independent representation of the original 3D scene. These data can be used to aid inter-view image compression or to generate stereoscopic pairs for multiple different view angles and screen sizes.
2D plus depth processing can be used to recreate 3D scenes even from a single view and convert legacy film and video material to a 3D look, though a convincing effect is harder to achieve and the resulting image will likely look like a cardboard miniature.
3D production.
Production of events such as live sports broadcasts in 3D differs from the methods used for 2D broadcasting. A high technical standard must be maintained because any mismatch in color, alignment, or focus between two cameras may destroy the 3D effect or produce discomfort in the viewer. Zoom lenses for each camera of a stereo pair must track over their full range of focal lengths.
Addition of graphical elements (such as a scoreboard, timers,or logos) to a 3D picture must place the synthesized elements at a suitable depth within the frame, so that viewers can comfortably view the added elements as well as the main picture. This requires more powerful computers to calculate the correct appearance of the graphical elements. For example, the line of scrimmage that appears as a projected yellow line on the field during an American football broadcast requires about one thousand times more processing power to produce in 3D compared to a 2D image.
Since 3D images are effectively more immersive than 2D broadcasts, fewer fast cuts between camera angles are needed. 3D National Football League broadcasts cut between cameras about one-fifth as often as in 2D broadcasting. Rapid cuts between two different viewpoints can be uncomfortable for the viewer, so directors may lengthen the transition or provide images with intermediate depth between two extremes to "rest" the viewers eyes. 3D images are most effective if the cameras are at a low angle of view, simulating presence of the viewer at the event; this can present problems with people or structures blocking the view of the event. While fewer camera locations are required, the overall number of cameras is similar to a 2D broadcast because each position needs two cameras. Other live sport events have additional factors that affect production; for example, an ice rink presents few cues for depth due to its uniform appearance.
TV sets.
These TV sets are high-end and generally include Ethernet, USB player and recorder, Bluetooth and USB Wi-Fi.
3D-ready TV sets.
3D-ready TV sets are those that can operate in 3D mode (in addition to regular 2D mode) using one of several display technologies to recreate a stereoscopic image. These TV sets usually support HDMI 1.4 and a minimum output refresh rate of 120 Hz; glasses may be sold separately.
Philips was developing a 3D television set that would be available for the consumer market by about 2011 without the need for special glasses (autostereoscopy). However it was canceled because of the slow adoption of customers going from 2D to 3D. (Citation needed)
In August 2010, Toshiba announced plans to bring a range of autosteroscopic TVs to market by the end of the year.
The Chinese manufacturer TCL Corporation has developed a LCD 3D TV called the TD-42F, which is currently available in China. This model uses a lenticular system and does not require any special glasses (autostereoscopy). It currently sells for approximately $20,000.
Onida, LG, Samsung, Sony, and Philips intend to increase their 3D TV offering with plans to make 3D TV sales account for over 50% of their respective TV distribution offering by 2012. It is expected that the screens will use a mixture of technologies until there is standardisation across the industry. Samsung offers the LED 7000, LCD 750, PDP 7000 TV sets and the Blu-ray 6900.
Full 3D TV sets.
Full 3D TV sets include Samsung Full HD 3D (1920x1080p, 600 Hz) and Panasonic Full HD 3D (1920x1080p, 600 Hz).
A September 2011 Cnet review touted Toshiba's 55ZL2 as "the future of television". Because of the demanding nature of auto-stereoscopic 3D technology, the display features a 3840x2160 display; however, there is no video content available at this resolution. That said, it utilizes a multi-core processor to provide excellent upscaling to the "4k2k" resolution. Using a directional lenticular lenslet filter, the display generates nine 3D views. This technology commonly creates deadspots, which Toshiba avoids by using an eye-tracking camera to adjust the image. The reviewers also note that the 3D resolution for a 1080p signal looks more like 720p and lacks parallax, which reduces immersion.
Standardization efforts.
The entertainment industry is expected to adopt a common and compatible standard for 3D in home electronics. To present faster frame rate in high definition to avoid judder (non-smooth, linear motion), enhancing 3-D film, televisions and broadcasting, other unresolved standards are the type of 3D glasses (passive or active), including bandwidth considerations, subtitles, recording format, and a Blu-ray standard. With improvements in digital technology, in the late 2000s, 3D movies have become more practical to produce and display, putting competitive pressure behind the creation of 3D television standards. There are several techniques for Stereoscopic Video Coding, and stereoscopic distribution formatting including anaglyph, quincunx, and 2D plus Delta.
Content providers, such as Disney, DreamWorks, and other Hollywood studios, and technology developers, such as Philips, asked SMPTE for the development of a 3DTV standard in order to avoid a battle of formats and to guarantee consumers that they will be able to view the 3D content they purchase and to provide them with 3D home solutions for all pockets. In August 2008, SMPTE established the "3-D Home Display Formats Task Force" to define the parameters of a stereoscopic 3D mastering standard for content viewed on any fixed device in the home, no matter the delivery channel. It explored the standards that need to be set for 3D content distributed via broadcast, cable, satellite, packaged media, and the Internet to be played-out on televisions, computer screens and other tethered displays. After six months, the committee produced a report to define the issues and challenges, minimum standards, and evaluation criteria, which the Society said would serve as a working document for SMPTE 3D standards efforts to follow. A follow-on effort to draft a standard for 3D content formats was expected to take another 18 to 30 months.
Production studios are developing an increasing number of 3D titles for the cinema and as many as a dozen companies are actively working on the core technology behind the product. Many have technologies available to demonstrate, but no clear road forward for a mainstream offering has emerged.
Under these circumstances, SMPTE's inaugural meeting was essentially a call for proposals for 3D television; more than 160 people from 80 companies signed up for this first meeting. Vendors that presented their respective technologies at the task force meeting included SENSIO Technologies, Philips, Dynamic Digital Depth (DDD), TDVision [http://www.tdvision.com/], and Real D, all of which had 3D distribution technologies.
There are many active 3D projects in SMPTE for both TV and filmmakers. The SMPTE 35PM40 Working Group decided (without influence from the SMPTE Board or any other external influence) that the good progress being made on 3D standards within other SMPTE groups (including the IMF Interoperable Master Format) means that its “overview” project would be best published as an Engineering Report. Broadcasters and other participants are still very active in 3D development, and SMPTE continues to be the forum where everyone from content creator to consumer manufacturer has a voice.
However, SMPTE is not the only 3D standards group. Other organizations such as the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), 3D@home Consortium, ITU and the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), at USC School of Cinematic Arts have created their own investigation groups and have already offered to collaborate to reach a common solution. The Digital TV Group (DTG), has committed to profiling a UK standard for 3DTV products and services. Other standard groups such as DVB, BDA, ARIB, ATSC, DVD Forum, IEC and others are to be involved in the process.
MPEG has been researching multi-view, stereoscopic, and 2D plus depth 3D video coding since the mid-1990s; the first result of this research is the Multiview Video Coding extension for MPEG-4 AVC that is currently undergoing standardization. MVC has been chosen by the Blu-ray disc association for 3D distribution. The format offers backwards compatibility with 2D Blu-ray players.
HDMI version 1.4, released in June 2009, defines a number of 3D transmission formats. The format "Frame Packing" (left and right image packed into one video frame with twice the normal bandwidth) is mandatory for HDMI 1.4 3D devices. All three resolutions (720p50, 720p60, and 1080p24) have to be supported by display devices, and at least one of those by playback devices. Other resolutions and formats are optional. While HDMI 1.4 devices will be capable of transmitting 3D pictures in full 1080p, HDMI 1.3 does not include such support. As an out-of-spec solution for the bitrate problem, a 3D image may be displayed at a lower resolution, like interlaced or at standard definition.
DVB 3D-TV standard.
DVB has established the DVB 3D-TV Specification. The following 3D-TV consumer configurations will be available to the public:
For the two broadcast scenarios above, initial requirements are for Pay-TV broadcasters to deliver 3D-TV services over existing HD broadcasting infrastructures, and to use existing receivers (with firmware upgrade, as required) to deliver 3D content to 3D-TV sets, via an HDMI or equivalent connection, if needed. This is termed Frame Compatible. There are a range of Frame Compatible formats. They include the Side by Side (SbS) format, the Top and Bottom (TaB) format, and others.
Broadcasts.

List of 3D Channels.
Standard HD channels have also broadcast in 3D. BBC HD occasionally broadcasts high profile events in 3D including the Wimbledon mens & ladies singles finals and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics.
3D episodes and shows.
There have been several notable examples in television where 3D episodes have been produced, typically as one hour specials or special events.
1980s.
The first-ever 3D broadcast in the UK was an episode of the weekly science magazine "The Real World", made by Television South and screened in the UK in February 1982. The program included excerpts of test footage shot by Philips in the Netherlands. Red/green 3D glasses were given away free with copies of the TV Times listings magazine, but the 3D sections of the programme were shown in monochrome. The experiment was repeated nationally in December 1982, with red/blue glasses allowing colour 3D to be shown for the first time. The programme was repeated the following weekend followed by a rare screening of the Western "Fort Ti" starring George Montgomery and Joan Vohs.
1990s.
In November 1993, the BBC announced a one-off week of 3D programming filmed using the pioneering Pulfrich 3D technique. 3D glasses were sold in shops around the UK, a percentage of the sales going to the Children In Need charity. The week's programming concluded with a screening of the 3D Doctor Who special Dimensions In Time as well as specially shot segments of Noel's House Party and the annual Children In Need charity appeal.
3D television episodes were a brief fad on U.S. television during the May 1997 sweeps. The sitcom "3rd Rock from the Sun" showed a two-part episode, "Nightmare On Dick Street", where several of the characters' dreams are shown in 3D. The episode cued its viewers to put on their 3D glasses (which used the Pulfrich effect) by including "3D on" and "3D off" icons in the corner of the screen as a way to alert them as to when the 3D sequences would start and finish. Customers were given free glasses courtesy of a joint venture between Little Caesars pizza and Barq's Root Beer. Also in May 1997, ABC had a special line-up of shows that showcased specific scenes in 3D. The shows included "Home Improvement", "Spin City", "The Drew Carey Show", "Ellen", "Family Matters", "Step by Step", "Sabrina, The Teenage Witch", and "America's Funniest Home Videos". Similar to "3rd Rock", an icon alerted viewers when to put on the 3D glasses. Customers were given free anaglyph glasses at Wendy's for the promotion. Nickelodeon had a special lineup of shows in 1997 that also showcased specific scenes in 3D promoted as Nogglevision; ChromaDepth was the technology of choice for Nickelodeon's 3D .
2000s.
Recent uses of 3D in television include the drama "Medium" and the comedy "Chuck" (Season 2, episode 12).
Channel 4 in the UK ran a short season of 3D programming in November 2009 including Derren Brown and The Queen in 3D. Unlike previous British 3D TV experiments, the programmes were transmitted in ColorCode 3D. 
2010s.
On 31 January 2010, BSKYB became the first broadcaster in the world to show a live sports event in 3D when Sky Sports screened a football match between Manchester United and Arsenal to a public audience in several selected pubs.

The screen made it to "The Guinness Book of World Records" as the world's biggest screen. The live 3D broadcast was provided by the company Viasat.
Health effects.
Some viewers have complained of headaches and eyestrain after watching 3D films. There have been several warnings, especially for the elderly. Motion sickness, in addition to other health concerns, is more easily induced by 3D presentations.
There are primarily two effects of 3D TV that are unnatural for the human vision: crosstalk between the eyes caused by imperfect image separation and the mismatch between convergence and accommodation caused by the difference between an object's perceived position in front of or behind the screen and the real origin of that light on the screen.
It is believed that approximately 12% of people are unable to properly see 3D images, owing to a variety of medical conditions. According to another experiment, up to 30% of people have very weak stereoscopic vision preventing depth perception based on stereo disparity. This nullifies or greatly decreases immersion effects of digital stereo to them.

Nonnensee

The Nonnensee is a lake in the borough of Bergen auf Rügen, Vorpommern-Rügen district, in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It is located northwest of the town of Bergen auf Rügen and is a very shallow lake. As a result, attempts were made as early as 1859/60 to drain the lake for agricultural land. Since about 1970 the lake was artificially drained and dried out. In 1993 the pumping station was shut and the lake re-established. Only a few tree stumps that jut out of the water, indicate that it was temporarily dry land. The lake is part of the protected area known as the North Rügen Bodden and Nonnensee ("Nordrügensche Bodden und Nonnensee") and is a breeding place and sanctuary for many bird species as well as a recreation area for the nearby town. For example, a five kilometre long circular path runs around the lake with benches and two bird hides from which the rich variety of bird life can be observed.
The lake lies at an elevation of 16.1 metres and has a surface area of 0.7 km².

Meteoalarm

www.meteoalarm.eu is the official website from Europe’s national weather services that will provide advice on exceptional weather. It is intended for anyone travelling through Europe. Pictograms and colour-coded maps of Europe show at a glance where the weather in the next 24 till 48 hours might be, or soon become, dangerous. The level of risk is colour-coded, based on likely damage, disruption and danger.
Thanks to the use of similar and easy pictograms and colour-coding everyone can instantly understand the weather messages, whichever country is involved and whatever language is spoken. Gales, torrential rain, snow and ice, thunder and lightning, fog and extreme temperatures are all indicated, as well as weather conditions that could lead to increased risk, such as storm surges and high waves, forest fires and avalanches. Behind the pictograms there is a link to the current warnings. More detailed information is given on the WebPages of the co-operating weather services. These are easy to visit by clicking on the country and then on the logo of the weather service.
Colours explained.
There are four colours to point out the weather conditions in a certain European country: green, yellow, orange and red.
If a country is coloured green, then there’s nothing to worry about.
This means potential danger. The weather is unlikely to be extreme but care is called for in activities that are dependent on the weather.
Danger. There is severe weather that may cause damage or accidents. The weather brings risks. It is wise to be careful and keep abreast of the latest developments in the weather. Take heed of advice given by the authorities.
Great danger from extremely severe weather. Major damage and accidents are likely, in many cases with threat to life and limb, over a wide area. It’s wise to be extremely careful, pay constant attention to bulletins and obey the instructions and advice given by the authorities. There may be exceptional measures taken.
"Especially for people who are colour-blind, the site has a greyscale map which translates the warning colours in different greyscales."
Member countries.
Meteoalarm.eu is developed by EUMETNET, the network of public European weather services who are members of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The weather service of Austria (Zentral Anstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik) is the responsible member for this project and does the technical realisation. The Dutch public weather service KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) gave close support. This project is officially called the "European Multiservice Meteorological Awareness Project" or "EMMA-project".
The member countries of www.meteoalarm.eu are: Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.
Award.
The EMMA-project received in October 2008 the EMS (European Meteorological Society) Outreach & Communication Award for the website www.meteoalarm.eu. The panel thought that this project was an excellent example of putting a bridge between weather services, science and society.
Usage and future developments.
The daily access rates reach 12 million per day during warning situations.
In the future the website will be expanding. Probably more countries will be participating. It is foreseen to connect with information providers and to disseminate weather warnings through SMS and email. A feedback feature with the possibility to present photographs from users might be a further step.

French Film

French Film is a 2008 British comedy film directed by Jackie Oudney and starring Anne-Marie Duff, Hugh Bonneville, Victoria Hamilton, Douglas Henshall and Eric Cantona. The film was shot in Spring 2007 at various locations around London including Waterloo station and the BFI Southbank.
Plot.
Two relationships in North London simultaneously draw to a close. Jed, a journalist is living with his long-term girlfriend, Cheryl, with the couple regularly seeing Jed's best friend Marcus and his girlfriend, Sophie. Compared to Marcus and Sophie, Jed and Cheryl's relationship is tired and dysfunctional which Jed tries to put right by suggesting marriage. When he asks her, Cheryl turns him down because of the lack of romantic chemistry in their relationship. In the meantime, Jed is preparing to interview the pretentious French film writer/director, Thierry Grimandi. Grimandi, who lives and works on the basis that he considers himself lucky "firstly because I am French, secondly because I make movies, and thirdly because I understand love" is shown regularly to give us the benefit of his advice.
Jed and Cheryl turn to a relationship counseller but when asked if he loves Cheryl, Jed can't bring himself to say "Yes", and instead covers up by saying of course, he "loves her TO BITS". Cheryl is unimpressed as Jed cannot declare his love without adding a qualification, and as they begin to drift apart, she rediscovers the pleasures of being more independent. Jed looks to his friend, Marcus for help and for advice from Grimandi who tries to school him in the French philosophy of love. The scenes as Jed travels around London on his bicycle cleverly give the city an appearance of Paris. In the meantime, Marcus meets an old girlfriend, keen on travel, rediscovering his youth and finding that the flame between them burns as brightly as ever. He resolves to leave Sophie and go away with his old flame.
Jed has long liked Sophie without realising that he was falling in love with her and even when Marcus and his new love leave London on the Eurostar to Paris, Jed lacks the courage to tell Sophie of his true feelings, even though she is aware of them herself. We see Jed undertaking the on-stage interview with Thierry Grimandi, for which he has been preparing and only then does he begin to understand his own feelings as he listens to the film director's pontifications. Jed rushes off to see Sophie, who greets him warmly, whilst we see Cheryl enjoying her new independence. We are left to assume that all live happily ever after...
Reception.
The film received an overall positive rating on the Rotten Tomatoes film review site, achieving 53% positive reviews. Reviews to the film were mixed, but many were negative. The "Daily Mail" described the film as "plodding and predictable - frightfully English, and not in a good way". The "Daily Telegraph" compared the dramatic function Cantona plays in the film as a man who reveals "some hidden truths - insights and wisdom denied to most men" to a similar role in the Ken Loach film "Looking for Eric" released at the same time.

Falstaff International Film Festival (FIFF) was a film festival that took place in Stratford-upon-Avon in 2009. During its inaugural year it was the largest film festival for rising talent and new cinema in the Midlands region of England. The festival supported commercial films, independent films, short films, as well as feature films
Purpose.
The festival was launched to reinvigorate the local filmmaking community following the short success of two previous international film festivals in the town. The festival also recognised the importance of William Shakespeare's influence on film and in entertainment, with Stratford-upon-Avon being his birthplace.
Festival 2009.
The first festival took place from November 14th to 20th of 2009 with entries from all over the world. The festival also relaunched the Midlands Short Filmmaking Competition that celebrated achievements from regional filmmakers. An awards ceremony concluded the festival.
Although film festivals in Stratford-upon-Avon have taken place consistently every two years no announcement has been made for a 2011 festival. The town is home to many types of festivals due to the popularity of the town and its tourist attractions. A suggestion has been made that the Stratford-upon-Avon Fringe Festival that was launched in 2010 may adopt the visual arts as part of its mandate.

<doc id="21576404" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21576404" title="Anostoma">
Anostoma

Anostoma, common name the up-mouth snails, is a genus of tropical air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Odontostomidae. Snails in this genus are found in Brazil.
Adult snails in this genus have an extremely unusual shell morphology: the aperture of the adult shell faces directly "upwards", in other words, in the same direction as the spire. This seemingly impossible arrangement is made possible because the adult shell is carried upside down. 
In 1901, the American malacologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry commented that the adult shell of "Anostoma" is "so bizarre that in the total absence of information upon its life history, no useful theory can be formulated to account for its peculiarities."
A very similar shell is found in the genus "Ringicella" Gray, 1847, which was previously considered to be merely a subgenus within "Anostoma", but it is now considered to be a genus in its own right.
How the shell is carried.
This is one of the most peculiar genera of land snails. The prominent feature of an upturned aperture (causing the adult snail to carry the shell spire down) is reflected in its scientific name "Anostoma": "ano", means up, or backwards, and "stoma" means mouth, from the Greek.
In this genus, the adult snails carry the shell completely upside down, with the umbilicus uppermost, and the spire facing downwards. To make this extraordinary feat possible, the mature aperture of the shell is aligned in the same plane as the rather low spire of the shell.
It appears that in juveniles, the shell is carried with the widest diameter vertically aligned, in other words, with the keel of the shell pointing up.
Shell description.
The width of adult shells varies from 23 to 45 mm.
Thomas Wyatt (1838) wrote about "Anostoma": "An extraordinary shell, sometimes called the antique lamp from its form. Shell orbicular, the spire convex and obtuse; aperture round, toothed within, grinning, turned upward to the spire; margin reflected."
The shell of "Anostoma" is heliciform, biconvex, solid, the axis hollow, but imperforate in the adult stage. The shell is composed of few whorls, the last straightened, turning toward the margin and upward. 
Before the last half whorl is formed, the shell is umbilicate, and judging by the growth-lines, the juvenile and subadult shell is carried with the equatorial plane nearly vertical. However, as the last half whorl starts to form, the direction of growth changes: it tilts to the right, not to the left as in the Helicidae, and subsequently that half whorl grows up across the base of the shell. The final aperture in the adult is slightly above the keel or widest diameter of the shell.
[[File:Anostoma aperture.jpg|right|thumb|A line drawing of the aperture of an adult shell of "Anostoma".
Sut = sutural fold
SP = suprapalatal fold
UP = upper palatal fold
LP = lower platal fold
B = basal fold
C = columellar lamella
IP = infraparietal lamella
P = parietal lamella
A = angular lamella]]
The apex of the shell is smooth and somewhat flattened. The peristome is expanded and reflexed. The semicircular aperture is turned upward, obstructed by numerous lamellae and folds. In the aperture of "Anostoma", the primitive condition of the parietal armature remains, the angular, parietal and infraparietal lamellae being all present and separate. In "Anostoma" the parietal lamella is the longest while in other Odontostomini the infraparietal lamella is the longest. The "teeth" of the aperture are entirely homologous with those of "Odontostomus".
The similar genus "Ringicella" has an additional feature on its shell: the angular lamella and upper suprapalatal fold are concrescent and form a perforation in the lip at its upper end.
Anatomy.
Pilsbry described the anatomy of what is now known as "Ringicella ringens". At the time that species was described as an "Anostoma", and Pilsbry (who was very thorough) did not make any comments that implied that there was any difference between the anatomy of that species and that of any of the other "Anostoma" species he examined. Thus, see Ringicella#Anatomy.
Anatomy of "Anostoma depressum" was examined by Harold Heath in 1914.
Distribution.
This genus of snails occurs in Brazil.
Species.
Species within this genus include:
Synonyms.
Very similar to the genus "Anostoma", the taxon "Ringicella" is currently considered to be a genus in its own right. Species that are now in the genus "Ringicella" were previously included in the genus "Anostoma".

Washington and Idaho Railway

The Washington and Idaho Railway is a shortline railroad that operates in the area south of Spokane, Washington, connecting the BNSF Railway at Marshall to Palouse, Washington, Harvard, Idaho, and Moscow, Idaho. It began operations in 2006 on ex-Northern Pacific Railway and Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway trackage formerly operated by the Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad, which had acquired it from the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1996.
History.
The Spokane and Palouse Railway, a predecessor of the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), completed a line from the NP's main line at Marshall south to Genesee, Idaho in 1888, and a branch from Pullman to Juliaetta, Idaho in 1891 (extended to Lewiston by the NP in 1898). The Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway (WI&M) finished its line in 1907, extending east from Palouse to Purdue, Idaho. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) gained control of the WI&M in 1962, and sold the property to the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), successor to the NP, in 1980. The BN sold the lines from Marshall to Arrow, Idaho and Palouse to Bovill, Idaho to the newly created Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad (PCC), which began operations in September 1996. It subsequently abandoned the ends from Harvard to Bovill and Moscow to Arrow, and in September 2006 the Washington and Idaho Railway began operating the remainder under contract. The Washington State Department of Transportation bought the trackage within that state in June 2007, and kept the Washington and Idaho Railway as the operator. It also has access to an ex-Union Pacific Railroad line west from Pullman to Risbeck (also formerly owned by the PCC) for railcar storage.

Ringicella

Ringicella is a genus of tropical air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Odontostomidae.
Adult snails of this genus have an extremely unusual shell morphology, very similar to that found in the genus "Anostoma" Fischer von Waldheim, 1807, of which this genus was previously considered to be merely a subgenus.
The adult snails in this genus carry their shells upside down, with the spire or apex at the bottom, and the umbilicus at the top.
Shell description.
The shell of "Ringicella" is very similar to that of "Anostoma".
Shells of the genus "Ringicella" have an additional feature: the angular lamella and upper suprapalatal fold are concrescent, forming a perforation in the lip at its upper end.
In addition, the apertural rim incorporates a small tube, which communicates with the interior of the shell.
The width of adult shells varies from 18 to 25 mm.
Anatomy.
This section is based on the anatomy of "Ringicella ringens", which is also valid for the genus "Anostoma" (according to 1901 information from Pilsbry).
Unlike the shell, the soft anatomy is not especially peculiar, in so far as it is known from Dr. Paul Fischer's (1857) account of "Ringicella ringens".
Radula.
The jaw and teeth are as they are in "Macrodontes". The radula of "Ringicella" (and also "Macrodontes") is rather aberrant for Bulimulinae: the central and lateral teeth have no side cusps, the marginals have an ectocone; the basal plate is short. The jaw is smooth, arcuate. The teeth are as in the terrestrial Holopoda (see taxonomy of Holopoda) generally, the centrals and laterals with single broad cusps, marginals short, with the ectocone developed.
Genitalia.
The genitalia are essentially similar to those of "Odontostomus". The genitalia are exceedingly lengthened in "Ringicella". The genitalia are of the haplogonous type, the long slender penis passing into a long vas deferens, upon which the penis retractor muscle is inserted; the duct of the globular spermatheca is extremely long. The elongation of the whole genital system is greater than in Helicoid snails generally, and doubtless correlated with the unusual length of the last whorl.
Araujo (1963) described male copulatory organs of "Ringicella ringens" as spirally coiled, that is different from previous description by Fischer and by Pilsbry.
Central nervous system.
The cerebral ganglia are more separated than usual in the Holopoda. The cerebral ganglia are connected by a short narrow commissure; the suboesophageal ganglia are as usual in the Bulimulinae.
Distribution.
This genus of snails occurs in Brazil.
Pilsbry (1901) mentioned "Ringicella carinatum" as also occurring in Colombia, in high forests of the Magdalena river basin at 1830 m (6000 feet) above sea level, but Vera Ardila (2008) considers the presence of the species in Colombia to be doubtful.

Carl Dahlén

Carl Dahlén (1770 – December 1, 1851) was a Swedish ballet dancer and choreographer, active first at the Royal Swedish Ballet at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm, and second at the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen at the Royal Danish Theatre in Denmark. He belonged to the first male Swedish stars at the Royal Swedish ballet.
He was made a figurante in the ballet 1785, a coryfee in 1789 and premier dancer in 1791. He participated in the pantomime ballet "Det dubbla giftermålet" by Jean-Rémy Marcadet opposite Margaretha Christina Hallongren, Hedda Hjortsberg, Joseph Saint-Fauraux Raimond and Carlo Caspare Simone Uttini the 1790–91 season. He was admired for his beauty and grace and was given attention by king Gustav III of Sweden. The circumstances of his departure from the Swedish ballet was well known. A nobleman from the royal court was sent to him with the message from the king, that he had been given a higher allowance; upon delivering the message, the courtier "allowed himself" a certain remarc in connection to this, which insulted Dahlen, who gave him a slap to the face. Dahlen then quickly left the capital in fear of the noblemans revenge. He was active at the ballet in Copenhagen for the rest of his career. He also composed his own ballet, Armida, which was performed in 1821–22. He retired in 1823. He married the Danish singer Johanna Elisabeth Morthorst who were active at the theatre in Copenhagen in 1784–1827.

Associated Press attributed responsibility for the executions to "rank-and-file soldiers carried out the massacre of their own accord, ignoring not only the normal rules of engagement but also their own command structure." The government of Mali published an announcement "expressing deep condolences, but stopping short of taking responsibility for the deaths."

Ashmoor Hockey Club

Ashmoor hockey Club was formed in 2003 and is based primarily in Ashburton, Devon. Since approximately 2007 Ashmoor have had to play their league matches at Isca College Exeter, because the 3G pitch at their home base of South Dartmoor Community College did not meet the new requirements of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) or England Hockey Board. They play in purple, green and white hooped socks, white shorts, and purple shirts. Ashmoor has established itself as a very strong team in Devon as well as a dominant force regionally and nationally. The Mens 1st team (formed when the club was established) has risen the equivalent of 8 divisions in their 7 seasons as a team winning 3 leagues and finishing strongly in the other seasons. The recently formed Ladies team comfortably won Channel 2B in their first season as a team. The majority of Ashmoor's success however comes from their junior teams. Different age groups have competed at numerous county, regional and national tournaments and finals, since the club's creation in 2003, in both indoor and outdoor hockey. The most notable successes have been the 5 National Indoor appearances and the National U15 Plate run that took them to a closely contested final showdown with Teddington Hockey Club (the oldest club in the world), unfortunately losing out 3 – 0. Many players have represented Devon county and played for the West of England teams as well as several players making the full England Junior squads, the Wales squads, and 6 being selected for the UK Lions. A lot of Ashmoor's success goes down to the quality coaching that junior and senior players receive and also the real 'community and family atmosphere' that the club is well renowned for. 
As of the 2013–14 season Ashmoor has four senior teams:

History.
During the Bronze Age - more than 3,000 years ago - clay was mined in the area of loam in order to produce pots and jars. Starting in 1840 the Kühnsche brickyard was extended by a clay and cement products factory. Following the bankruptcy of 1880, the factory building of 1883 was up until the 1960s as a day-and-garden "Seeschloß" used with dance hall and bowling alley. Today, no traces of the factory are found.
Another brickyard was built 1854th. It was modern and bigger and had a more effective ring oven which can have up to 12,000 burnt bricks daily. The brickyard was in operation until 1924. The 72 m high chimney was blown in 1932. A time to plant belonging building still stands in the Beneke Dorff Road 115, which is named after the former mill owners.
Famous buildings, which were built from the bricks of the local brickworks, are the Red City Hall and the City Hall Reinickendorfer.
By 1912, alake was eventually created by the slow flow of groundwater. It was 30 to 40 m deep. Other witnessed the two flooded former clay pits (about 50 × 50 × 50 m and 150 m). They are located west, 500 meters away. Several surrounding street names also reminiscent of the clay mining.
Geography.
The lake is located in Lübars, a locality belonging to the Berliner borough of Reinickendorf.
The shape of the lake resembles a trapezoid (geometry) from the well Südsüdostufer 300 m long, which is followed by the east at a right angle, a 150 m long beach and under which a 200 m long beach faces parallel. In the north-north-east is a well 200 m long beach, the final oblique side of the "trapezoid".
In the southern part of the bank overgrown with reeds and trees, steep and inaccessible and can not be swum. In the northern part, the banks are flat and occupied by 1926 built pool Lübars (lido Lübars). There are lawn, kept sandy beach and a few artificially fixed portions. The managed pool has basic facilities to bars, beach chair rentals and various sports and play facilities and the designated naturist area. The lake is accessible only through the pool.
There is an inflow about 75 meters away and about 4 to 5 acre lake Hermsdorfer. This in turn flows through the Tegeler Fliess, which ultimately results in Lake Tegel.

Orthodoxy - as practiced in Ghana. 
Noncanonical orthodoxy emerged in Ghana in 1932.<http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/church_history/anderson_ghana.htm The «African Universal Orthodox-Catholic Church» was organized by the charismatic African Bresi-Ando, but he and his followers vaguely knew the meaning of the term «Orthodoxy», and tried to find the true church. In 1972, Godfried Mantey and Kwame Joseph Labi, two of the church's youth leaders, read «The Orthodox Church» by Timothy (KALLISTOS) Ware which strengthened their church's religious quest. Two years later, Mantey and Labi met personally with representatives of the Orthodox world, and on 15 January 1978, Metropolitan Irineos, Metropolitan of Accra and All West Africa, (within the Patriarchate of Alexandria), made his first visit to the faithful of Ghana. By September 1982, the organization was admitted into the Orthodox communion within the Patriarchal Throne of Alexandria and All Africa. Now there is active missionary work, led by a resident archbishop. Thousands of Orthodox Christians from among the local population are served by 23 priests. A local Orthodox seminary is now open in Ghana.

Joseph Rosenberger

Joseph Rosenberger (יוסף בן משה הלוי) (died November 2/3, 1996) was an Austrian Jewish garment worker who, by founding the first "shatnes" laboratory in America, single-handedly introduced "shatnes"-checking in the United States. The lab he founded still exists at 203 Lee Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Biography.
Rosenberger arrived in the United States in 1940 after having spent 5 months in the Dachau concentration camp. From the time he arrived in America until 1944, he lived in a refugee home sponsored by the "Zeirei Agudah" at 616 Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Rosenberger's father had a clothing store in Austria and he was interested in fabrics from a very early age.
Rosenberger was approached by Moshe Neuman to find out how to best check garments for shatnes, a biblically forbidden mixture of wool and linen according to Jewish law. Rosenberger sought out garment dealers in both Williamsburg and the Lower East Side of Manhattan but found that there was both little knowledge and little interest in this area of Jewish law.
Armed with a passion, Rosenberger enrolled in Manhattan's Textile High School in order to learn all he could about linen. He coupled this with taking menial jobs in the garment industry in order to find the many uses that linen had in clothing manufacturing. He also searched the New York Public Library for information on testing for the presence of linen, but found that all current tests were either too slow or too expensive for him to employ with any hopes of encouraging others to accept his recommendations.
In under a year, Rosenberger developed a quick and inexpensive test for the presence of linen in a garment, but he still had to overcome the hurdle of convincing the Orthodox Jewish community of the importance of checking for "shatnes". Rosenberger was often booted out of synagogues and assembly halls with derision by the public who did not believe him to be genuine.
Things changed when Rosenberger met Mike Tress, who was in charge of Orthodox Youth Magazine. Tress was impressed with Rosenberger's willingness and offered him free advertising space in the magazine, along with free use of the office phones and copy machine. Rosenberger taught himself to type so as to be able to produce posters and other forms of reading material about the importance of checking for "shatnes".
Tress also introduced Rosenberger to Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein, spiritual leader of the West Side Institutional Synagogue, who had many congregants involved in the garment industry, including Alex Levy, owner of Crawford Clothes. Goldstein convinced Levy to lend Rosenberger $250 for advertising space in The Jewish Morning Journal. The advertisements states that free "shatnes" checking would be available at Crawford Clothes. Although only five customers came to have their garments checked that first week, Crawford Clothes' competitors feared that customers would see them as not providing the same level of service at Crawford. They sought out Rosenberger and arranged for him to check their customers' merchandise as well, and when people saw that the clothiers could no longer guarantee their clothes were free of "shatnes", Rosenberger's dream was realized; people became very interested in making sure that their clothing should not contain "shatnes".
Goldstein used his connections to network Rosenberger with the most influential Orthodox Jewish organizations of the time, such as the Agudas Israel and the National Council of Young Israel. Goldstein also penned a letter of endorsement in 1941 under the auspices of the Orthodox Union addressed to hundreds of congregational rabbis stressing the importance of informing their congregants of the need to have their garments checked for "shatnes".
Rosenberger . died on the 7th day of the Jewish lunar month of "Cheshvan".
Williamsburg shatnes laboratory.
In 1941, Rosenberger opened the first "shatnes" laboratory in North America in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.

List of winners of the Chicago Marathon

The Chicago Marathon, one of the six World Marathon Majors, has been contested by men and women annually since 1977. Since 1983, it has been held annually in October. The United States has been represented by the most Chicago Marathon winners (eight men and twelve women). After a seventh consecutive win by a Kenyan man in 2009, Kenyan men have won more times (ten) than men representing any other country. The United Kingdom is in third place in total victories (eight), victories by men (five) and victories by women (three). All four of Brazil's victors have been men, and all three of Portugal's winners have been women. The next edition of the race will be held in 2014.
The first six pairs of races were swept by the United States. Runners representing the United Kingdom won both races in 1996 (Paul Evans and Marian Sutton). Kenya has been victorious in both races twice (1998 and 2001) and is the most recent country to do so, with representatives Ben Kimondiu and Catherine Ndereba. Deena Kastor, the 2005 female winner, is the last victor from the host nation. Although four-time winner Khalid Khannouchi represented the United States during his 2000 and 2002 victories after becoming an American citizen, the last American-born male winner was Greg Meyer. 1979 winner Laura Michalek of the United States was just 15 years old.
Khannouchi's four victories is the most by any contestant. There have been several two-time winners including Khannouchi, five men and six women. Four of the five male two-time winners have been consecutive winners (most recently Evans Rutto in 2002 and 2003), and six of the seven two-time female victors have been consecutive (most recently Berhane Adere in 2006 and 2007). No one other than Khannouchi has won three races and no one has won three consecutively.
There have been two male and two female world records for the fastest marathon time set in the race. The United Kingdom has had both a male and a female fastest marathon world record in Chicago. The most recent fastest marathon world record was set by Paula Radcliffe, who succeeded Catherine Ndereba as a world record holder in 2002. Khannouchi set the last male fastest marathon world record in the Chicago Marathon in 1999. After Ndereba set the record in 2001, both the men's and women's current fastest marathon world records had been set in the Chicago Marathon.

Anthony Shepherd (born 16 November 1966 in Glasgow) is a Scottish former football player. He was a midfielder coming from the Celtic Boys Club.
Shepherd signed with the senior Celtic side in August 1983 and debuted at Parkhead in a 2-1 Scottish Cup victory over Queen’s Park on February 2, 1986 making both the goals in that game for Brian McClair and Roy Aitken. He was sent off in the 1986 Scottish League Cup Final when the referee assumed he had been struck by Shepherd from behind. When the referee accepted that he had been hit by a coin and not by Shepherd, he allowed Shepherd to remain on the field.
Shepherd struggled to hold down a first team place at Celtic and was sent on loan to Bristol City during the 1988/89 season. He left Celtic in 1989 and had spells with clubs including Carlisle United, Motherwell, Portadown and Cliftonville.

Wolf-baiting

Wolf-baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of wolves. 
Historically, the baiting of wolves was more in the context of training dogs for wolf hunting than public entertainment. Wolves would sometimes be caught, either at the end of hunts, or in set traps, and would be set upon by the dogs, usually as a way of helping them master their fear of the animal. When training young or inexperienced dogs, the wolf would be hamstrung. Accounts as to how wolves react to being attacked by dogs vary, though John James Audubon wrote that young wolves generally show submissive behaviour, while older wolves fight savagely. 
One of the earliest recorded incidents of wolf-baiting occurred during one of the Roman civil wars. The Dacians, hoping to take advantage of Rome's division, pressed their chieftain Scorlyo to launch an offensive. Scorlyo brought several dogs to the city square, which immediately began fighting one another. However, a captured wolf was brought in, to which the dogs ceased their fighting and attacked it. By this, Scorlyo intended to teach his people that whatever war a nation had within itself, it would always stand firm in attacking an outsider. However, wolves can be extremely dangerous opponents for dogs, even when outnumbered. Louis XIII of France once acquired an old wolf and set his best dogs on it three at a time. The wolf managed to kill twelve of them without sustaining any serious injury. The fighting styles of wolves and dogs differ significantly; while dogs typically limit themselves to attacking the head, neck and shoulder, wolves will make greater use of body blocks, and attack the extremities of their opponents. Theodore Roosevelt once wrote that he considered a large mastiff a match for a wolf only if the latter was a young or undersized Texas wolf, though he conceded that even if the dog was the heavier of the two, its teeth and claws would be very much smaller, weaker and its hide less tough.

Avitabatrachus uliana

Avitabatrachus uliana is the single species in the extinct genus Avitabatrachus, a genus of prehistoric frogs that lived in the Middle Cretaceous. Fossils of "A. uliana" were found in north-west Patagonia in Argentina. It was properly described in 2000 and was then concluded to be most closely related to Pipidae frogs and hence was included in Pipimorpha.
Etymology.
The genus name, "Avitabatrachus", is derived from the Greek "avita" meaning "ancient" and "batrachos" meaning "frog". It is called so because it is the oldest record of pipids in South America. The species name, "uliana", is named in honour of Miguel Uliana.

Aspidosaurus

Aspidosaurus is an extinct genus of dissorophoid temnospondyl within the family Dissorophidae. Like other dissorophids, "Aspidosaurus" species had a single row of plates formed by expansions of the neural spines.
In 1911, Paul Miller discovered the remains of various dissorophid bones in New Mexico that were attributed to a new species, "Aspidosaurus novomexicanus". The skull closely resembled that of a specimen of "Cacops aspidephorus" found in Texas but the arrangement of ridges in the otic region was different. The teeth found were slender and conical and all of an approximately equal size. The vertebral column, pelvis and limb bones were also similar but the new specimen was distinguished from "Cacops" by the armour, the single row of vertical plates that were originally attached to the neural spines of the vertebrae. "A. novomexicanus" was later attributed to the genus "Broiliellus". More recently, ""A." novomexicanus" has been removed from "Broiliellus" and classified as a closer relative of "Cacops". The original specimen is now housed in the University of California Museum of Paleontology and is referred to as the "Rio Arriba taxon" because of its uncertain phylogenetic placement.
Phylogeny.

Almasaurus

Almasaurus is an extinct genus of trematosaurian temnospondyl within the family Latiscopidae. It is known from several skulls and some postcranial material found from the Argana Formation in Morocco, which dates back to the Early Triassic. 
When it was first named in 1972, "Almasaurus" was placed within its own superfamily, the Almasauroidea. Although the related latiscopid "Latiscopus disjunctus" possesses exoccipitals that are underplated (a feature that suggests that it is a member of the family Trematosauridae) "Almasaurus" is not considered to be a trematosaurid because it lacks such underplating. "Almasaurus" was considered to be a capitosaurian by Warren & Black (1985) because it shared several characters with the group, including a deeply notched squamosal and a lacrimal flexure, while supposedly exhibiting none of the characters associated with trematosaurians. However, more recent studies have concluded that "Almasaurus" is either a temnospondyl more basal than the clade formed from the dichotomy between Capitosauria and Trematosauria or that the genus is closely related to the trematosaurian family Metoposauridae, perhaps being a sister taxon of it.
A temnospondyl genus described in 2000, "Rileymillerus", is thought to be closely related to "Almasaurus".

CS Gloria CTP Arad is a Romanian professional football club from Arad, founded in 1913. They currently play in the Liga IV in the 2012–13 season.
History.
The club was born on August 24, 1913. (Colours: yellow-blue). The man behind this ideea was dr. E. Veliciuiu and with the help of dr. Sever Miclea, dr. E. Crâsnic, R. Moldovan, Nestor Blaga, ing. Cărpișan, I. Goicea and Coriolan Lupșa, he saw it took shape. In 1922, the club merges with "CFR Arad" (founded in 1921) and takes on the name Gloria CFR Arad. The players that appeared then were: Kiss, Hustig, Magory, Pop I, Pop II, Szabó, Müller, Cioară, Cheța, Barbu II.
In 1923 the club succeeds to win the regional championship and qualifies for the final tournament, but it is eliminated in the quarter-finals by Chinezul Timişoara.
In 1929 it succeeds the same performance, this time being eliminated by Banatul Timişoara.
The club's best performance, before the divisional system was inaugurated, was obtained in 1930, when the team led by Virgil Economu plays the final against Juventus Bucureşti. The players that contributed, among others, were the following: Deciu, Albu, Cosma, Igna, Marienuț, Faur, Tisza.
Starting with 1932, until the interruption of the championship because of the war, the club played in the First division, with one exception, in 1939-1940. The standard team used in that period was: Fr. Theimler - Fr. Hustig, I. Volintir - C. Weichelt, Șt. Dobra, I. Lupaș - P. Igna, V. Tudor, Fr. Frentz, I. Marienuț, Gh. Mercea. We can also mention: Gh.

After the war, the club played for two years in the Second Division, but in 1949 the name of Gloria disappears from all records.
In 1969, Gloria re-appears in the Arad County Championship (Liga IV), and it succeeds to promote in the Third Division. It plays there until 1978, when it relegates back to the Fourth Division.
In the summer of 1978 a School Sports Club of high performance is founded, and takes Gloria`s name further.
In the recent years, the club is named Gloria CTP Arad and struggles in the Romanian Third Division, not succeeding very much.
In the summer of 2012 it relegated to the Liga IV.

Southern Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)

The Southern Theatre is an historic theater located at 21 East Main Street in downtown Columbus, Ohio. It opened on September 21, 1896 and is the oldest surviving theater in Central Ohio and one of the oldest in the state of Ohio. The Southern Theatre is currently owned and operated as a home for live concerts, plays and opera by CAPA (the Columbus Association for the Performing Arts). CAPA also manages several other venues in Columbus including the Ohio, the Palace, and the Lincoln Theatres.
History.
Design.
Between 1889 and 1893 a series of fires destroyed five downtown Columbus theaters. As a result, a group of businessmen decided to develop a new hotel and theater with modern construction and safety features on the southern edge of downtown. The building was called "The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House", and was designed by the local architectural firm of Dauben, Krumm, and Riebel. Construction began in 1894. Both the theater and the hotel were constructed of "fireproof" tile, brick, iron, steel, and concrete.
The theater's auditorium design was progressive for its day and was reminiscent of Louis H. Sullivan's 1891 Schiller Theatre in Chicago. From the proscenium opening, a series of concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, one of the first commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, generated its own power. Additionally, the building had three wells in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply. The theatre currently seats 933 and is an intimate "jewel box" type theater with two balconies.
In 1982, the Southern Theatre and its associated hotel were added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Use.
The Great Southern Theatre originally hosted theatrical touring productions. Sarah Bernhardt was just one of the famous performers to play the theater in its first two decades. In the 1910s and 1920s the theater, now called the Southern, featured first run silent films and live vaudeville. From the 1930s on, the Southern was a popular home for second-run double features. In the 1970s the theater briefly returned to first run fare as the Towne Cinema, showing black exploitation movies. Throughout the 1970s the Southern also hosted a weekly live Country Music Jamboree, sponsored by local radio station WMNI. 
The theater closed in 1979 and in 1986 was acquired by CAPA. After sitting empty for nearly two decades, the Southern was completely restored by CAPA in 1997-98 during an extensive 14-month rebuilding process. The newly restored Southern Theatre reopened on September 26, 1998.

Ålvik

Ålvik is a village in the municipality of Kvam in Hordaland county, Norway. The village "urban area" consists of the settlements of Ytre Ålvik og Indre Ålvik (outer and inner Ålvik) and Vikadal. The settlements are located on either side of a ridge with Vikadal in between. Indre Ålvik has been heavily industrialised since the early 1900s, when Bjølvefossen A/S was established. The village lies along the Ålvik bay on the northern shore of the Hardangerfjord. The village has a population (2013) of 488, giving the village a population density of . Ålvik Church is located in the village.
History.
The name "Ålvik" is probably derived from Old Norse word "ǫlr" which means "alder" and the word "vik" which means "bay". The settlement here dates back at least to 600-700 BC, as documented by bronze artifacts found in the Vikedal area. In medieval times, Ålvik belonged to the estates of Norheim in Norheimsund.
The foundations for Indre Ålvik as an industrial district were laid in 1905, when Bjølvefossen A/S was incorporated to exploit the Bjølvo waterfalls for hydroelectric energy. In 1907, the village still had only 74 inhabitants, as little activity took place until Bjølvefossen A/S was sold to Elektrokemisk A/S in 1913. After this, construction of the Bjølvefossen hydroelectric plant commenced. The construction was however stalled due to concession disputes, as it was claimed that the work on the plant had begun before Norwegian escheat laws had been put in force in 1907. 
The disputes were solved in 1916 and both the plant and factories were completed by 1919, producing calcium carbide for a brief time. The village's population briefly rose by 500 workers, but most left shortly thereafter, as financial problems and an accident destroying the pipelines that supplied water from the hydroelectric reservoir brought production to a halt. This forced Bjølvefossen A/S to default on large loans. Large-scale production was only resumed in 1928, when, after the pledgees had established contact with C. Tennant's Sons & Co., Bjølvefossen A/S was given major sales contracts for ferrosilicon to the British steel industry, in an effort to open a price war with the European ferrosilicon syndicate. Production was briefly hit by the Great depression, but quickly rebounded and a production line for ferrochrome was established in 1934, the same year that the company saw its first profit.
Ålvik gained a road connection to Bergen in 1937, when the Fyksesund Bridge was opened. Nearly all of the village's infrastructure was owned by Bjølvefossen A/S for a long time, to a great extent making it a company town, and it was a separate regulatory area until 1965.
In the 1950s several new furnaces for production of ferrochrome and ferrosilicon were installed. During the 1960s, Bjølvefossen struggled to remain competitive, yet was able to invest in new production facilities on both production lines. In the 1970s, however, new technology in steel production reduced demand for the low-carbon ferrochrome that was produced. Government environmental regulations also put pressure on the production economy. Employment at the plant thus peaked at about 600 in this decade, before ferrochrome production was discontinued on the old production line in 1979 and on the new in 1983. Ferrosilicon production was prioritised to comply with environmental standards, furnaces were rebuilt to a closed type, making it possible to recycle excess heat in a steam turbine and to remove all dust from the discharge fumes. The dust, silica slurry, was found to be a saleable product.
The 1970s saw the entrance of women into production positions at the plant. Before this, the female population of Ålvik was mostly engaged in housekeeping, although some positions were open to women in cleaning and clerk jobs, besides public services. The first women begun work in the packing facilities, and relatively few took positions at the furnaces.
In 2001, the owner, Elkem decided to lay off 100 of 245 workers at Bjølvefossen A/S.
Natural geography.
Ålvik is situated on the northern side of the Hardangerfjord, facing the deepest stretch of the fjord. Ålvik is divided by a ridge into two main settlements, Indre Ålvik and Ytre Ålvik. The name Ålvik denotes the two settlements as a unit.
The bedrock in the Ålvik area consists mainly of gabbro and granite from the Bergsdal field. The vegetation at sea level is sarmatic mixed forest, rich in alm. Mountainous forests are found at higher altitudes. The village has several populations of the orchid sword-leaved helleborine and a natural reserve containing an especially large population of taxus baccata.
Economy.
The former Bjølvefossen A/S is the village's main employer, it has historically dominated to such an extent that the village has been referred to as the most typical monotown in Norway. It is now a subsidiary of Elkem, "Elkem Bjølvefossen", which in turn is owned by China National Bluestar. In 2006 it was decided to move ferrosilicon production to Elkem Iceland, and at that time the plant had a staff of about 160. Elkem has since announced that the old production will be replaced by a process recycling waste from aluminium production, which will require a staff of about 60. However, as of March 2012, production was still running at full capacity, and hiring new staff was being discussed.
Bjølvo kraftverk, the hydroelectric plant originally built to power industrial production was returned to state ownership by escheat in 1964, and is now owned by Statkraft. The current, modernised plant, Nye Bjølvo, was completed in 2006 and at that time had the highest free-fall pressure shaft of any European hydroelectric plant, at more than 600 m. It has a yearly output of about 390 GWh. The plant exploits the reservoir Bjølsegrøvatnet, which has a regulated surface at 850–879 meters above sea level.
The municipality of Kvam runs the following public services in Ålvik: a kindergarten, a school covering the 1st through 7th grades, a medical office and a care home.
Cultural life and heritage.
The Ålvik Industrial Worker's Museum documents the village's labour heritage through the exposition of two restored worker's apartments typical to the 1920s and 50s, and is housed in an original neo-classical building. In a cooperation between Elkem Bjølvefossen and Kvam municipality, an artist's collective was established in one of Bjølvefossen's buildings. This arrangement has now expired, and its future is unclear. In a project developed in cooperation with the Bergen Academy of Arts and Design, a co-localised café and library was established in 2010. The village has a wealth of volunteer organisations, among them Ålvik Rock, which stages a Rock Festival each September.
After the completion of Nye Bjølvo hydroelectric plant, the old funicular became obsolete. It was originally built for construction and maintenance access to the original pipes leading water from the hydroelectric reservoir to the plant, and had a maximal inclination of 61 degrees along its 1500 meter course. It was discussed whether it could be conserved as part of the region's cultural heritage and run as a tourist attraction, but this proposal failed.

<doc id="21576982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21576982" title="Broomistega">
Broomistega

Broomistega is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian in the family Rhinesuchidae. It is known from one species, "Broomistega putterilli", which was named in 2000. Fossils are known from the Early Triassic "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group in the Karoo Basin of present-day South Africa, a region that had been an enclave of Gondwana. Specimens of "B. putterilli" were once thought to represent young individuals of another larger rhinesuchid such as "Uranocentrodon", but the species is now regarded as a paedomorphic taxon, possessing the features of juvenile rhinesuchids into adulthood.
In 2013, a well preserved skeleton of "Broomistega" was discovered alongside the skeleton of the cynodont "Thrinaxodon" (a mammal relative) in a cast of a burrow. The individual probably entered the burrow while the cynodont was in a state of aestivation (dormancy), and afterwards a flash flood filled the burrow with sediment to preserve both bodies together.
Paleobiology.
"Broomistega" is the only rhinesuchid known from the Triassic Period. Its presence in the Early Triassic indicates that rhinesuchids survived the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction about 252 million years ago. However, compared to the diversity of rhinesuchids that existed in the Permian Period, "Broomistega" is a very rare component of the Early Triassic Karoo fauna. It may have been the last surviving representative of the group, making it a relict taxon.
Association with "Thrinaxodon".
The most complete skeleton of "Broomistega", specimen BP/1/7200, was discovered in the sandstone cast of a burrow (BP/1/5558) after the cast was scanned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2013. The cast was first found in the Karoo Basin of South Africa by paleontologist James Kitching in 1975, but was left unprepared for many years. Part of a skull of a cynodont was exposed on the surface of the cast, allowing Kitching to attribute it to the genus "Thrinaxodon". Only after the synchrotron scanning was the "Broomistega" skeleton found. All bones are preserved except for a few phalanges of the right hind foot, and nearly all of the bones are articulated as they were in life. The skeletons do not show evidence of stiffening due to rigor mortis after death, but are pressed against the sides of the burrow as the animals would have been when alive. The skeleton of BP/1/7200 is preserved belly-up, resting on the right side of the "Thrinaxodon" skeleton. This position was probably the result of the individual being pushed on top of the "Thrinaxodon" by floodwater entering the burrow.
"Broomistega" is not thought to have been a burrowing animal and was instead semi-aquatic. Several specimens of "Thrinaxodon" are known from burrow casts but whether it dug burrows or simply occupied them after they were dug by other animals is debated. The "Thrinaxodon" individual preserved in BP/1/5558 was probably the original occupant of the burrow, and the "Broomistega" individual probably entered the burrow later. The joints of BP/1/7200 are not well developed, indicating that the individual was a juvenile with large amounts of cartilage in its skeleton. Several ribs on the right side of the skeleton are broken, indicating that the individual was severely injured before entering the burrow, probably by being crushed. The animal was still alive when it entered the burrow because the rib fractures show evidence of healing, but the injury probably impacted its ability to breath and to move about. Two holes are present on the skull roof of BP/1/7200. Although they resemble bite marks, they do not match with the teeth of the "Thrinaxodon" specimen.
The presence of two different species of large vertebrates in the same burrow is unusual. Modern examples of this association are usually the result of predator-prey interactions (for example, a predator storing the body of its prey in the burrow) or mutualistic relationships whereby the original occupant gains protection from predators by the presence of the second inhabitant. However, the benefit of cohabitation usually only works when there are multiple burrows, casting doubt on the possibility that the "Thrinaxodon" was benefiting from the presence of the "Broomistega". Because the "Broomistega" skeleton lacks any sign of damage caused by the "Thrinaxodon", the two were probably not predator and prey. The most likely explanation for the association as of 2013 is that the "Thrinaxodon" tolerated the "Broomistega" or was unable to remove it, possibly because it was aestivating. As is the case with many modern amphibians, the "Broomistega" probably entered the burrow to seek temporary shelter. During the Early Triassic the Karoo Basin was seasonally arid, so the "Thrinaxodon" may have been aestivating to conserve energy during a time when resource availability was low and the normally aquatic "Broomistega" may have entered to burrow to escape the hot and dry conditions of its environment.

Broiliellus

Broiliellus is an extinct genus of dissorophoid temnospondyl within the family Dissorophidae. "Broiliellus" is most closely related to the genus "Dissorophus", and both have been placed in the subfamily Dissorophinae. "Broiliellus" is known from three species from the Early Permian: the type species "Broiliellus texensis" and the species "Broiliellus brevis" and "Broiliellus olsoni". A fourth species, "Broiliellus novomexicanus", which was originally named "Aspidosaurus novomexicanus", is now thought to fall outside the genus as a member of the subfamily Cacopinae.
Phylogeny.
The phylogenetic analysis of Schoch (2012) found that "Broiliellus" was most closely related to "Dissorophus". However, the three species of "Broiliellus" did not form their own clade, but rather a polytomy (unresolved evolutionary relationship) with "Dissorophus".
Holmes, Berman & Anderson (2013) named a new species of "Broiliellus", "Broiliellus reiszi". They performed two phylogenetic analyses using the data matrix of Schoch (2012). In the second analysis the codings for ""B." novomexicanus" (i.e. Rio Arriba taxon) were not modified. This analysis yielded more resolved topology and a monophyletic "Broiliellus" with the exclusion of ""B." novomexicanus". Below is the cladogram from that analysis:

Bothriceps

Bothriceps is an extinct genus of stereospondyl temnospondyl. It is a member of the infraorder Trematosauria and is the most basal brachyopomorph known. It is one of the only brachyopomorph that lies outside the superfamily Brachyopoidea, which includes the families Brachyopidae and Chigutisauridae. It shares several similarities to "Keratobrachyops", another basal brachyopomorph, and may be closely related to or even synonymous with it.
The genus was named in 1859 by Thomas Henry Huxley with the description of its type species "B. australis" from the Early Triassic of Australia. It was originally assigned to the family Brachyopidae and was not reassigned to a more basal position until 2000, when the clade Brachyopomorpha was constructed to accommodate for it. The genus "Bothriceps" once included several species, but the only species assigned to it now is the type. "Bothriceps major", named in 1909, was reassigned to the family Rhytidosteidae as the type species the genus "Trucheosaurus" in 1998. The brachyopid "Platycepsion wilkinsoni" (then referred to as "Platyceps wilkinsoni") was reassigned to "Bothriceps" in 1890 and in 1969, but was placed back within the original genus in 1973.

Ruppiner See

Ruppiner See is a lake in Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Brandenburg, Germany. At an elevation of , its surface area is . 
History.
A Slavic fortification stood at the mouth of the Rhin on the northern shore. In the 12th century, the German settlement of Ruppin (now called Altruppin) was established next to it. A few decades later, Neuruppin was established on the southwest shore. A mill was built in Altfriesack, between the Ruppiner See and the Bützsee next to the Slavic settlement of Wustrau. The latter is probably the oldest settlement on the lake. Around the lake are other villages, which mostly now belong to the municipality of Neuruppin. Wustrau and Altfriesack now form one division in the municipality of Fehrbellin.
Economic and strategic importance.
The lake was strategically important as it was the center of the Slavic area. It was also of economic importance due to its fisheries and for transportation. The building of the Ruppiner Canal in 1788 increased its importance, as it was then connected to the Havel and thereby with Berlin.
Since 1898, a railroad causeway on the Kremmen–Wittstock line has cut the lake in two, 2.5 km from the north shore running east and west.
Today, the Ruppiner See is the reservoir for the wetlands known as the Rhinluch. Until the beginning of May, water is held there from the spring runoff. It is then released over the locks in Alt Friesack to prevent the wetlands from drying out. The management of this runoff has the potential for political conflict.

Batropetes

Batropetes is an extinct genus of brachystelechid microbrachomorphs. Although it was first classified as a reptile, "Batropetes" is now known to be a genus of microsaur amphibians. "Batropetes" lived during the Sakmarian stage of the Early Permian. Fossils attributable to the type species "B. fritschi" have been collected from the town of Freital in Saxony, Germany, near the city of Dresden. Additional material has been found from the Saar-Nahe Basin in southwestern Germany and has been assigned to a second species, "B. niederkirchensis".
Description.
"Batropetes" is small and short-bodied for a microsaur. The orbits are large and the skull is short. "Batropetes" possesses scales on its underside that are similar to those of reptiles.
"Batropetes" is distinguished from "Carrolla", another brachystelechid microsaur, by the presence of three cusps on the premaxillary and anterior dentary teeth. In "Carrolla", there are only two cusps. Additional diagnostic features seen in "Batropetes" include a supraoccipital bone that is not fused to the otic capsule, the presence of a retroarticular process (a projection at the back of the lower jaw), and two proximal bones in the tarsus.
Classification.
The first known material now attributed to the genus "Batropetes" was originally referred to the genus "Hyloplesion" in 1882. Several specimens from Freital were described under the name "Hyloplesion Fritschi" as small non-labyrinthodonts. Three years later, the specimens originally referred to as "Hyloplesion Fritschi" were reassigned by Carl Hermann Credner to the genus "Hylonomus" under the name "Hylonomus fritschia". Newly discovered specimens of other forms from the same locality led Credner to believe that two taxa existed. He named one, an amphibian, "Hylonomus geinitzi", and the other, a reptile, "Petrobates truncatus". 
Later preparation of the material examined by Credner through a technique of removing the soft bone from the surrounding matrix mechanically and casting the cavities in liquid latex has revealed more anatomical detail that suggested that three taxa were present in Freital, not two. A specimen previously referred to "Petrobates truncatus" was first considered by Robert L. Carroll and Pamela Gaskill in 1978 to be a microsaur rather than a reptile. It was considered distinct from "Petrobates", then considered a captorhinomorph, based only on the structure of the atlas. 
Of the three species represented in Frietal, "Hylonomus geinitzi", as described by Credner, has since been reassigned to the microsaur genus "Saxonerpeton", and "Petrobates truncatus" was designated as "Batropetes truncatus" by Carroll and Gaskill in 1971. Carroll and Gaskill still referred to "B. truncatus" as a captorhinomorph reptile. 
Carroll and Gaskill described a new microsaur in 1978 from Frietal, which they called "Brachystelechus fritschi". It was noted that the skull of "Brachystelechus" bore a striking resemblance to that of "Batropetes", which was considered to be unrelated. It differed from "Batropetes" in that it possessed an internarial bone which was not seen in known specimens of "Batropetes".
A newly discovered specimen of microsaur from the Saar-Nahe district in southwestern Germany has confirmed that "Brachystelechus" and "Batropetes" represent the same species. The characters that previously distinguished the two genera from one another are all found in one specimen, known as SMNS 55884, housed in the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart. This a complete specimen preserved in ventral view and consisting of a part and counter part. The skull roof was examined by excavating the matrix from the top of the block and exposing more anatomical features. The occipital condyle in SMNS 55884 clearly indicates that it is a microsaur rather than a captorhinomorph reptile. The occipital condyle was not noticeable in the specimen of "Brachystelechus". An interfrontal bone is seen in material once referred to "Brachystelechus" but not in any material known from specimens previously attributed to "Batropetes". This may be a result of poor preservation, or perhaps intraspecific variation. The parietals of the specimen are wide and the skull is short, both of which are features that associate it with the North American genera "Carrolla" and "Quasicaecilia". On the basis of these and other similarities, Carroll, who described the new material in 1991, constructed a new microbrachomorph family called the Brachystelechidae to include "Batropetes", "Carrolla", and "Quasicaecilia".
A 2013 study of "Batropetes" erected a new species, "Batropetes niederkirchensis", for specimen SMNS 55884. SMNS 55884 was noted to differ from the type specimen of "B. fritschi" in the number of presacral vertebrae, the width between the eye sockets, the shape of the prefrontal, postorbital, and scapulocoracoid bones, and the position of the obturator foramen in the hips.

Elfrather See

Elfrather See is a lake in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. At an elevation of 30 m, its surface area is .
The Elfrather lake, popularly known as E for short-sea, is located in the north east of the city of Krefeld on the border of the Elfrath district. The lake was created from a disused gravel pit, which has been filled with groundwater. The degradation was made in the Lower Rhine because of the low water level with typical wetness reduction construction of a dredger. The gravel was taken up in the 1970s for the construction of the A57 Highway, which was set up for the gravel pit as a place of central material supply. After the completion of the lake from the 1970s, it was expanded to its today's recreational area with many spacious lawns.
The lake is now Elfrather primarily a long race track. Swimming in the lake is actually banned because of boat traffic. There is a swimming lake next to the regatta course created specifically. On the sheltered by bushes and of the ways her non-accessible areas of the shore and the regatta course is nudist tolerated. Overall, the lake has a water area of , the water level is 30 m above sea level. It was not until the early 2000s, that the lake was completed. One problem was Vennikel Street, which had crossed the lake and is now demolished, to expand the regatta course to full length.
A variety of water sports has settled around the lake. The lake offers opportunities for rowers, sailors and windsurfers. Also for model boats, there is a separate area. There are courses available to obtained a license of regatta. For divers, the lake was long uninteresting, only the fire departments and various emergency services trained here regularly. A disused boat is sunk in the lake and is now a wreck for diving despite poor visibility. The DLRG (German Association to Save Life) the lifeguard of the German Red Cross in turn lead supervision on and around the lake.
The lake is separated from the regatta course. Around the lake there is a large lawn, which in summer is always well attended. The entrance to the lake is still free, is only for the parking demands in the summer months for a fee. Nearby there is a large playground, restrooms with showers and toilets, a kiosk and a barbecue area with built stone fireplaces. For kite flying, there is a specially reserved large meadow.

Artificial intelligence and law

Artificial intelligence and Law (AI and Law) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) mainly concerned with applications of AI to legal informatics problems and original research on those problems. It is also a field concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export original tools and techniques to the larger enterprise of AI, by concerning itself with automation in the legal domain (e.g. contributing to natural language processing, intelligent databases, and datamining), theories of legal decision making (e.g., contributing to knowledge representation and automated reasoning), and models of social organization based on the rule of law (e.g., contributing to multi-agent systems).
AI and Law was first introduced to the general public within the law field by L. Thorne McCarty's "Harvard Law Review" article in 1976, "Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning."
The main community of AI and Law convenes a biennial conference, The International Conference on AI and Law. There are related conferences, including JURIX (the Dutch Legal Informatics group), and researchers whose principal concerns are legal expert systems, multiagent systems, ontologies, defeasible reasoning, deontic logic, case-based reasoning, and social philosophy.
Because of the influence of Howard Turtle's WIN system (WestLaw's natural language query search interface to its citation database), and other legal research databases, AI and Law research was concerned with search, citation ranking, ontologies, semantic technologies (e.g., semantic web), and xml before many other communities.
Legal decisionmaking takes place in a constructed social world (as opposed to the naturalistic world that is subject to empirical investigation), so AI and Law has been less concerned with machine learning over continuous spaces than other areas of AI in recent decades.

Fellows &amp; Sons

Fellows & Sons is an auctioneers based in the heart of Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter They specialise in antique jewellery, wrist & pocket watches, silverware, coins & medals, furniture, toys, glassware and ceramics. Fellows was established in 1876 and is one of the United Kingdom's oldest and most respected firms of auctioneers and valuers.
History.
The company's origin can be traced back to the collapse of an order for bicycles in 1876. When William Henry Fellows, who was based in Digbeth, was left with the unwanted order he decided to sell the bicycles by auction. The family, who were also pawnbrokers, used auctions to sell uncollected pledges. William Henry Fellows was followed by his son Francis Henry Fellows – who was known as ‘Frank H’ – in Loveday Street. 
It was during the 1920s that the business grew, with Frank H selling items belonging to refugees escaping from the ravages of the Russian revolution. 
Frank H was in turn followed into the business by his two sons William and Albert Fellows, who ran the business from Greenfield Crescent in Edgbaston, Birmingham.
The brothers also saw a wide variety of goods from refugees from the Nazi persecution who were able to smuggle out some of their worldly wealth. Sales in this era also included lost property from the Royal Mail. 
William and Albert were followed into the business by Antony Fellows, the son of Albert, who based the company in Hagley Road, Birmingham. Fellows & Sons moved in 1990 to Augusta House in the Jewellery Quarter, the firm's current home. His daughter Jayne Fellows has taken over the running of the business with her husband Stephen Whittaker, who is the managing partner.
The couple have seen the company grow from five staff to twenty. The company now holds over 50 sales per year, more than half of which are for jewellery. This growth has been helped by the firm specialising in other niche markets such as watches, costume jewellery, toys, silver and furniture.
In 2007, Fellows expanded the company once more by opening an office in Mayfair, London, targeting new business in London and the south east.
Modern Technology.
One of the first auction houses in the UK to launch live internet bidding back in 1999.In 2008 Fellows introduced social bookmarking and RSS feeds onto its catalogues and website.
Valuers.
Fellows has a strong team of experienced valuers and auctioneers which includes Kevin Jackson. 
Kevin is a furniture and toy valuer with over eighteen years experience. He has worked for both television and local radio appearing on "Bargain Hunt", "Flog It", "House Call", Saga FM and Radio WM.
Charities.
Fellows carries out several auctions at fund raising events each year for various charities such as the NSPCC, Marie Curie, Alzheimer's Society and the Birmingham Children's Hospital. 
In November 2007, a collection of 24 Christmas cards sent from Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales to a founder member of the Prince of Wales's Committee, were donated to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Society. Four days before the sale the cards were withdrawn. The Alzheimer's Society had contacted Clarence House out of courtesy, but officials disapproved the auction as they regarded the cards as ‘personal and should not be in the public domain’.
Tommy Tranter.
As part of its services, Fellows carries out house clearances a source of much of the furniture it sells and also one of its more notable sales. Tommy Tranter was a local antiques dealer who lived in a large Victorian terraced house crammed with pictures, bronzes, music boxes, coloured glass and militaria. It took the valuers two days to empty the house due to the sheer volume of items and was split into a two day sale. 
A story had leaked that Tommy had died intestate and as a result Fellows were besieged by ‘wannabe’ Tranters. Fellows did however discover his sister who had been adopted at birth and she became a significant beneficiary of the value of her late brother's collections. 
The second day of the sale went live on local TV. Queues of people formed outside the auction house, each wanting an item from the Tommy Tranter collection. It was one of Fellows’ more famous sales.
Record Rolex Submariner.
Fellows recently sold a rare vintage Rolex Submariner - model number 5513 with movement calibre 1530. The model was sold in Fellows' Wrist & Pocket Watch auction in January 2009. It was estimated at £900 - £1,400 but surpassed this and was snapped up for a staggering £35,000 by a bidder in the room.
This particular model is highly collectable so it attracted a lot of interest from people around the world.
Staffordshire VAT Scam Assets Auctioned.
Fellows also recently sold watches belonging to Craig Johnson, Meaford Hall, Staffordshire currently serving 12 years for fraud and money laundering. He was the mastermind behind a mobile phone sales swindle which made a reported £138 million. Some of his assets included £200,000 worth of Rolex watches and jewellery. One of his watches sold for £37,000 breaking watch record prices at Fellows. The watch was a Rolex platinum and diamond set DayDate.

Czatkobatrachus is an extinct genus of prehistoric amphibian. It was erected in 1998. It is, with "Triadobatrachus", one of the two oldest known lissamphibians. More precisely, it is a member of Salientia; it is related to, but outside Anura, the taxon that includes all extant frogs. It is known only from the early Triassic of Poland. Its vertebral column may have been short as in other salientians, but the exact count is unknown. It had a short tail, and an elongated ilium.

<doc id="21577043" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21577043" title="Cryobatrachus">
Cryobatrachus

Cryobatrachus (from Greek, (krýos, "cold") and (batrakhos, "frog")) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian from the Early Triassic of Antarctica. The type species is "Cryobatrachus kitchingi". It is known from a partial skull and an imprint of the skull roof, both found in the Fremouw Formation of the Transantarctic Mountains at about 85° south latitude and described in 1974. Many small bone fragments have also been identified, although they cannot be attributed with certainty to "C. kitchingi". "Cryobatrachus" has been classified in the family Lydekkerinidae, as it is similar in appearance to the genus "Lydekkerina" from South Africa. Because only a small number of features distinguish it from other lydekkerinids, "Cryobatrachus kitchingi" has more recently been considered a "nomen dubium", meaning that its distinction from other better-known species may be unwarranted.
Discovery and specimens.
Fossils of "Cryobatrachus" were first found by South African paleontologist James Kitching in the austral summer of 1971–72 as part of an expedition headed by the Institute for Polar Studies at Ohio State University, now known as the Byrd Polar Research Center. Paleontologists Edwin Harris Colbert of the American Museum of Natural History and John Cosgriff of Wayne State University described these fossils in 1974, positing the new genus and species "Cryobatrachus kitchingi" with the specific name honoring Kitching. All specimens were uncovered from the lower part of the Fremouw Formation, which dates back to the Early Triassic. The holotype specimen, cataloged as AMNH 9503, is a partial skull with the ventral surface of the dermal bones present. The palate and braincase are not preserved. An additional paratype specimen called AMNH 9556 includes an impression of the skull roof, but no preserved bones. AMNH 9503 was found on Kitching Ridge (which is also named after James Kitching) near Shackleton Glacier, and AMNH 9556 was found on Mount Kenyon near McGregor Glacier. Two crushed skulls from Kitching Ridge were also considered possible specimens of "Cryobatrachus", as was part of an upper jaw from Halfmoon Bluff (which is on the opposite side of Shackleton Glacier as Kitching Ridge). Colbert and Cosgriff tentatively attributed six smaller fragments from Coalsack Bluff to "Cryobatrachus", including parts of lower jaw, the clavicle, and the interclavicle. Fifteen other Coalsack Bluff fragments, attributed as possible remains of "Cryobatrachus" based on their small size alone, were described. These bones included parts of the legs, hips, vertebrae, and skull. A 1977-78 expedition found a bone fragment on Collinson Ridge and an interclavicle on Shenk Peak southeast of the paratype locality on Mount Kenyon, both of which were referred to "Cryobatrachus" in 1984.
Description.
While most temnospondyls are characterized by features on the upper surface of the skull roof or the palate, only the underside of the skull roof is exposed in the holotype of "Cryobatrachus". This part of the skull is not very well known in other temnospondyls, since it is normally hidden by the palate. The rock encasing the upper surface of the holotype skull was not removed because of time constraints during the 1971-72 expedition and fear that the specimen might be damaged.
"Cryobatrachus" is most similar in appearance to the temnospondyl "Lydekkerina" from South Africa, and to several other temnospondyls in the family Lydekkerinidae such as "Limnoiketes". In all of these temnospondyls, the eye sockets are closer to the tip of the snout than they are to the back of the skull. The skull of "Cryobatrachus" is about long, smaller than those of "Lydekkerina", which are normally long. Unlike "Lydekkerina", "Cryobatrachus" has a slightly oval-shaped skull that is widest near its middle rather than at the very back. The eye sockets are spaced closer together than they are in "Lydekkerina". The parietal foramen, a small hole at the top of the skull behind the eyes, is oval-shaped rather than circular as in most other temnospondyls. A space in the squamosal bone called the otic notch extends far into the skull, as in other lydekkerinids and a similar group of Triassic temnospondyls called rhinesuchids. However, the notch in "Cryobatrachus" is unusual in that it is crescent- rather than oval-shaped and that it ends in a sharp point rather than a rounded margin. "Cryobatrachus" can be distinguished from another group of Triassic temnospondyls called capitosaurians in that its quadratojugal bones (which make up the back of the upper jaws) end at the level of the tabular horns (which project from the back of the skull roof). In most capitosaurians, the quadratojugals extend past the tabular horns.
As is the case in other lydekkerinids, "Cryobatrachus" lacks the deep grooves on the skull that support a lateral line sensory system in other temnospondyls. The paratype specimen of "Cryobatrachus" shows that the upper surface of the skull was covered in small pits, with only a shallow groove running between the eye sockets. The lack of a lateral line system in "Cryobatrachus" and other lydekkerinids is usually taken as evidence that they spent most of their time on land, since lateral lines are typically only present in aquatic animals that use them to detect vibrations in water.

Cordicephalus gracilis

Cordicephalus gracilis is the only species in the extinct genus "Cordicephalus", a genus of prehistoric frogs. Fossils of "C. gracilis" were found in a lacustrine deposit in Makhtesh Ramon called "Amphibian Hill" and it is believed they lived during the Lower Cretaceous.
When first described by Eviatar Nevo of the University of Haifa (in 1968) the genus "Cordicephalus" was thought to contain two species, "C. gracilis" and "C. longicostatus". Since then it was redescribed and it was determined that "C. gracilis" was the only species in the genus.
Etymology.
The genus' name derives from the Latin "cordi" (cor meaning heart) and "cephalus" (meaning head). The name comes from the heart-like shape of its skull. The species name, "gracilis", comes from the Latin for slender.
Description.
Like its close relatives, "C. gracilis" was fairly small, about in length. It had a flat skull which was almost as wide as it was long, features usually found in aquatic animals. Other features that support that view that "C. gracilis" had a mainly aquatic lifestyle is its short axial column as well as large foot bones which may imply extensive webbing.

Colosteus is an extinct genus of colosteid tetrapod from the Late Carboniferous (late Westphalian stage) of Ohio. Its remains have been found at the Linton site in Saline Township, Ohio, where it is one of the most common tetrapods, and at the Five Points site in Mahoning County, Ohio. It was an elongate, aquatic form with a flattened and pointed head, greatly reduced limbs, two premaxillary tusks, and heavy scalation. It would have reached about 1 m (3.2 ft) in length.
It was originally described by John Strong Newberry in 1856 as a new species of the palaeonisciform fish genus "Pygopterus". In 1869, Edward Drinker Cope erected a new genus of "batrachian", "Colosteus", containg the species "C. crassicutatus", "C. foveatus", and "C. marshii", based on Linton material lent to him by Newberry. Cope later realized that the holotype of his "Colosteus crassicutatus" was also the holotype of Newberry's earlier "Pygopterus scutellatus", and combined the two as "Colosteus scutellatus". "Colosteus foveatus" was later determined to be a junior synonym of "Isodectes obtusus", and "Colosteus marshii" was given its own genus, "Ptyonius"

Chitti annavaram

The Chitti annavaram temple, dedicated to Lord Sri Sathya narayana swamy, is situated in Madanapalle town of Andhra Pradesh in India.
Etymology.
"Anna" means "whatever you say or you desire" and "varam" means "boon", hence whatever you desire will be given as boon by the deity.
Temple.
Chitti Annavaram.
The distinctive feature of Chitti Annavaram is that adoration of Lord Sri Uma Maheshwara Swamy, Lord Sri Satyanarayana Swamy and Sri Ananta-lakshmi Ammavaru on one Peetham, which speaks of the one-ness of both Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu.
The most distinctive feature of Annavaram is the shrine to Lord Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy on the hill top. The name of the Goddess is Ananta-lakshmi Satyavathi Ammavaru.
This temple is the replica of the Sri Sathyanarayana swamy Temple which is situated in Annavaram, East Godavari District.The popularity and importance of the Annavaram temple situated in East Godavari District is considered as second only to Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. Lord Sri Sathya narayana swamy temple in Chitti Annavaram is similar in all aspects to that Annavaram temple which is situated East Godavari district.
Lord Sri Sathyanarayana Swamy Temple at Annavaram, East Godavari District.
The area is accessible by road, bus and rail lines. The temple itself can be reached by stairs, a covered path, or a goat trail.
The popularity and importance of the temple is gaining among the people who make pilgrimages to these temples. Festivals are celebrated year-round at this temple with great pomp and ceremony. Some of the popular festivals celebrated are the Kalyanam festival in May, Devi Navaratri festival in September, the Swayamvara Vardhanti of Sraavana Suddha Ekadashi Day, Srirama Kalyana, Kanakadurga Yatra, Prabha Utsavam, Teppa Utsavam and Jalatoranam.
The serene atmosphere of the temple and its surroundings captivate devotees of Lord Veera Venkata Satya-narayana Swamy. The prasadam (loosely translated as "blessed food") offered to the devotees has a wonderful taste that cannot be replicated.
History.
According to the Puranas, the presiding deity, Lord Sri Sathyanarayana Swamy, blesses the devotees with Anina Varam ("Wanted Boon"). It is commonly known now as Annavaram (EG Dist).
There is a history of Annavaram elsewhere; this temple was founded as a result of a dream inspiring members of the Akhila Brahmana Seva Samakya in dream during their stay in Annavaram (EG Dist) in connection with the Andhra Pradesh Brahmana Sabha. Planning began in 1999, with the Sri Gayathri Arsha Vidya Mandir Trust, and construction was completed in 2006.

Galverpeton

Galverpeton is an extinct genus of prehistoric salamander. It lived during the Barremian-Aptian stages in the Early Cretaceous, in what is now Western Europe. The type species, "Galverpeton ibericum", was described by Estes and Sanchíz in 1982. It was found in the El Castellar formation, part of the Galve fossil assemblage. The fossil is in the Institut Paleontologic Miquel Crusafont, Sabadell.
It is related to "Apricosiren", "Bishara", "Hylaeobatrachus", "Marmorerpeton", and "Ramonellus".

Callobatrachus

Callobatrachus is an extinct genus of discoglossoid anuran amphibian from the Early Cretaceous-age Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China. It was described in 1999 by K. Gao of the American Museum of Natural History and Y. Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Discovered in the Sihetun locality of the western part of Liaoning province, in the lower part of the Yixian Formation, the fossil dates to approximately 124.6 Ma. "Callobatrachus" is considered to be the most basal member of Discoglossidae based on phylogenetic analysis.
As frogs are rarely found as articulated skeletons in the fossil record, the discovery of this new taxon has provided important insight into anuran evolution.
The holotype, IVPP V11525, is known from a nearly complete skeleton exposed in a dorsal view on a shale slab. Its total body length (from snout to vent) is estimated at approximately 94 mm. It differs morphologically in many respects from all other discoglossoids, including the number of presacral vertebrae (9 instead of the usual 8) and other primitive characters. Although it had a mosaic of primitive and derived characters, it can be unequivocally placed as the most basal taxon of the clade. This shows that the taxon diverged early from the stem and evolved separately as a distinct lineage by the Early Cretaceous in East Asia.
The skull is described as being short and wide and is well preserved. The maxillary region is less well-preserved but it can be determined that each premaxilla bears 18-20 slender and conical teeth, and the maxilla bears approximately 40-50 fine pedicellate teeth. The vertebral column consists of nine presacral vertebrae, a single sacral vertebra, and a free urostyle. Three pairs of ribs were found associated with presacrals II-IV. The hind limbs are remarkably well-preserved and are slenderly built, with an approximate total length of 116 mm. Its hind feet have the phalangeal formula 2-2-3-4-3, with its fourth digit being the longest at 27 mm.
Before its description, "Callobatrachus" was announced in Chinese media as "sanyanlichan".

Calamops

Calamops is an extinct genus of large temnospondyl amphibian known from the base of the Solebury Member of the Late Triassic Newark basin of Pennsylvania, USA. "Calamops" was first named by Sinclair in 1917 and the type species is "Calamops paludosus". It was usually thought to be a metoposaurid of questionable validity as its holotype and only known specimen, which comprises three pieces of a left mandibular ramus, had never been prepared. Following a preparation and casting of the specimen, Hans-Dieter Sues and Rainer R. Schoch found in 2013 "Calamops" to represent a valid taxon of trematosauroid temnospondyls that can be diagnosed by several autapomorphies. It represents one of the geologically youngest known long-snouted trematosaurs and the first record of these temnospondyls from the Late Triassic of North America. It is also the oldest known tetrapod fossil from the Triassic of the Newark basin.

Maramureș

Maramureș (Romanian: "Maramureș"; ; ; ; ; ) is a geographical, historical and ethno-cultural region in northern Romania and western Ukraine. It is situated on the northeastern Carpathians, along the upper Tisa River; it covers the Maramureș Depression and the surrounding Carpathian mountains.
Alternatively, the name Maramureș is used for the Maramureș County of Romania, which contains the southern section of the historical region.
Geography.
Maramureș is a valley totally enclosed by mountains Oaș, Gutâi, Țibleș and Rodnei to the west and south, Maramureș Mountains and Ukrainian Carpathians ("Wooded Carpathians") to the east and north, with a thin opening at Khust. Several dozen small mountain rivers and creeks flow into the river Tisa. It is forested and not easily accessible.
The limits of the region are between the parallels of 47°33' N and 40°02' N and the meridians of 23°15' E and 25°03' E. Maramureș represents one of the largest depressions in the Carpathians, covering an area of about 10000 km².
Its length from Khust to Prislop Pass is about 150 km and width from North to South is up to 80 km.
The main mountain passes linking Maramureș with the neighboring regions are high and in the past were hardly accessible in the winter. Prislop Pass (1414m high) links the region in the east towards Moldavia, Dealul Ștefăniței (1254m) in the south towards Transylvania, Pintea Pass (987m) towards Baia Mare and Fărgău (587m) in the west towards Oaș Country, while Frasini Pass (Yasinia) (931m) links the region in the north to Galicia.
The mountains surrounding this region occupy more than half of the area. Several peaks reach 2000m, such as Pietrosul (2303m) in the Rodnei Mountains to the south and Hovârla (2061m) in Muntele Negru (Cernahora) to the north.
The heavy forested mountains sustain many protected species of plants, such as yew ("Taxus baccata"), larch ("Larix decidua"), Swiss pine ("Pinus cembra"), edelweiss ("Leontopodium alpinum"); and animals, such as lynx ("Lynx lynx"), chamois ("Rupicapra rupicapra"), alpine marmot ("Marmota marmota"), golden eagle ("Aquila chrysaetos"), and capercaillie ("Tetrao urogallus").
The last wisent from present day Romania territory, a symbol of Maramureş, was hunted to extinction in 1852. Lostriţa, a local variety of salmon, still live in the mountain rivers.
Several protected areas have been created in the Maramureș. Rodnei Mountains National Park was designated in 1930, Maramureș Mountains Natural Park in 2004 and there are many other caves, gorges, cliff formations and lakes that are officially protected areas.
History.
In ancient times, this area was settled by Celts, Dacians, Sarmatians and Germanic peoples. In the first century BC, it was part of the Dacian Kingdom under Burebista, while in the early Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Hunnic Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Kingdom of the Avars, the White Croatia and the Kievan Rus'.
The territory was part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century and was nominally divided between the Gyepű border region, comitatus of Szatmár and comitatus of Borsova. Later, the whole region was included into the comitatus of Máramaros. Initially, the inhabitants of the region were allowed to preserve their native political organization, the "Voevodates", which formed many small autonomous areas. The King long struggled to convince the Voivodes to accept the title of Count, with the implied losing independence in political and financial matters. During the Middle Ages, the people in many mountain villages, where each family by definition had a considerable domain, were called "nameşi", meaning free peasants taking pride in their family (the origin of the word is disputed, in the Kingdom of Hungary, free people possessing land were called "nemes" in Hungarian, in Romanian "neam" means extended family).
In the 16th century, medieval Kingdom of Hungary was invaded and destroyed by the Ottoman Empire, and area came under administration of the semi-independent Ottoman Principality of Transylvania and later (in the end of the 17th century) under administration of the Habsburg Monarchy (later known as the Austrian Empire). During Habsburg administration, region was firstly part of the Habsburg Principality of Transylvania, but was later (in 1732) included into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary and the region was included into the Transleithania or Hungarian part of the Monarchy and formed the Máramaros County.
After the First World War, the region was divided between Romania and Czechoslovakia at the territory of Hutsul Republic, while during World War II (from 1939/1940 to 1944), the whole area was controlled by Hungary. After World War II, the southern section remained within the Romanian borders and is now part of Maramureș County; the northern section was incorporated into the Soviet Union and is now part of Zakarpattia Oblast of independent Ukraine.
People.
In the southern area, the majority of the population are Romanians. There are also some Hungarians, Rusyns (Ukrainians), Zipser Germans, Jews, and Roma. In the northern area, the majority are Ukrainians, with smaller Romanian, Hungarian and German communities.
In the northern area most people speak Ukrainian language, while in the southern area most speak Romanian, which is why the region was split into two parts. Since the 1940s there have been villages cut in two by the state border. There are some villages in the north (within Ukraine) that have sizable Romanian population, as well as some villages in Romania that have sizable Ukrainian population.

William Feilding (British Army officer)

General The Honourable William Henry Adelbert Feilding (6 January 1836 – 25 March 1895) was a British soldier of the Coldstream Guards. 
Feilding was a son of William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh and his wife Lady Mary Elizabeth Kitty Moreton. He served in the Crimean War and was British commissioner to the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War. He was decorated in the field by General Chanzy with the Legion d'honneur for saving the wounded under fire in a burning hospital. He became a Colonel in the Coldstream Guards and was Inspector-General of the Recruiting HQ from 1891 to 1894. The town of Feilding in New Zealand was named after him.
In 1871, the Directors of the Emigrants and Colonists Aid Corporation began to look at selecting a block of land so they could proceed with their proposed emigration scheme for the labouring class. Feilding, a colonel at the time, and one of the Directors of the Corporation, was selected to travel to both Australia and New Zealand looking at possibilities. During his trip his social standing gave him an entree to the people who mattered in government circles in both countries. Finding the land and conditions of sale and settlement in Australia were not in line with the expectations of the Corporation, Feilding sailed for New Zealand and arrived in Auckland on 2 December 1871. By 12 December he was in Wellington and being put up at Government House at the invitation of Sir George Bowen Governor of New Zealand. By 11.30am that same morning, he was in discussion with "the ministers at the Government building" about possible blocks of land that might suit the Corporation. Co-operation was such that Feilding was able to request a rough draft of possible conditions the New Zealand Government would be prepared to offer the Corporation by the very next day.
Feilding journeyed by coach up the coast to Foxton near to mouth of the Manawatu River, where he was met by Arthur Halcombe whose job it was to escort him to view an area of inland Manawatu that the New Zealand Government had available for sale. On 15 December the two men left Foxton on horseback and rode to Palmerston North. After lunch they rode first to what is now the town of Ashhurst, then walked five miles to Manawatu Gorge where the first roadway through the gorge was being formed.
On Saturday 16 December Halcombe and Feilding rode through what was to become the Manchester Block. The two men were guided by James Whisker, who with his brother-in-law John Hughey leased land from the Ngati Kawhata on the banks of the Oroua River. Feilding spent the night at "Westoe" with Sir William Fox and his wife. During his exploration of the area Feilding spent several restless and feverish nights plagued by mosquitoes which bit him even through his corduroy trousers; he had to borrow a pair of slippers to be able to hobble around as his feet were so swollen. Back in Wellington on 20 December at the negotiating table, an agreement was made to purchase the 106,000 acre (400 km²) Manchester Block for the price of £75,000 from the Wellington Provincial Government. Recruiting of emigrants could now begin in England.
Colonel Feilding came back to New Zealand to visit the new settlement of Feilding for the first time in 1875. Immigrants had been arriving for a year and life had been a struggle for them. A horribly wet winter had made conditions even more miserable for those who had been expecting green fields and landscape similar to what they had left behind in England. Feilding spoke to an open air meeting of settlers from the veranda of the Corporation's office, giving practical advice on coming to terms with their life, and sympathy for those who had found the going tough. He tried to sort out any immediate grievances and problems that he could.
Great progress followed and in 1895 when Feilding - by then General Feilding - made his next and last visit to the town named after him, he was able to view a thriving settlement. He stayed at Mrs Martha Hastie's Feilding Hotel, then a substantial two-storeyed wooden building with fifty rooms for guests, a sample room, a big dining room, and an adjoining assembly room. There was also a large orchard. Feilding must have felt satisfied to see the swampy clearing he had ridden though only twenty-four years before was now an established little town.
Feilding died of cholera in Bangkok and is buried in the Bangkok Protestant Cemetery. 
Feilding married Charlotte Leighton, daughter of Sir Baldwin Leighton, 7th Baronet.

Indobrachyops

Indobrachyops is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian from the Early Triassic of India. It is known from a nearly complete fossil skull that was first described by paleontologists Friedrich von Huene and M. R. Sahni in 1958 from the Panchet Formation in Raniganj Coalfield. "Indobrachyops" belongs to a group of mostly semi-aquatic temnospondyls called Stereospondyli, but its exact placement within the group has been uncertain since its first description. 
Classification.
Huene and Sahni considered "Indobrachyops" to be part of the family Brachyopidae, which includes several aquatic temnospondyls with large rounded heads. However, later studies noted several features of "Indobrachyops" that set it apart from brachyopids, including closely spaced nostrils and a different pattern of pits and grooves on the skull roof. In 1979, J. W. Cosgriff and J. M. Zawiskie placed "Indobrachyops" in a new family called Indobrachyopidae along with the poorly known temnospondyls "Mahavisaurus" and "Rewana". The lacrimal bone in the skull is an important feature in classifying stereospondyls, but its presence has been difficult to judge in the single known skull of "Indobrachyops". One study suggested that it lacked a lacrimal, which it used as evidence to reclassify "Indobrachyops" within the family Rhytidosteidae. In 1998 paleontologists Anne Warren and Claudia Marsicano proposed that it did have a lacrimal, albeit a very small one that suggested a primitive position for "Indobrachyops" within Rhytidosteidae. A phylogenetic analysis of rhytidosteids by Marsicano and Sérgio Dias-da-Silva in 2011 supported the inclusion of "Indobrachyops" within Rhytidosteidae. The analysis went against Warren and Marsicano's 1998 findings by placing "Indobrachyops" as one of the most derived rhytidosteids. Marsicano and Sérgio Dias-da-Silva classified the genus within a new subfamily of rhytidosteids, Derwentiinae. Below is a cladogram from their study:

Hyperokynodon

Hyperokynodon is an extinct genus of trematosaurian temnospondyl within the family Trematosauridae. Fossils have been found in Germany. While most trematosaurids existed during the Early Triassic, "Hyperokynodon" has been found in Late Triassic deposits, making it the youngest known trematosaurid. "Hyperokyodon" was known since 1852, but it was not identified as a trematosaurid until 1987. The type and only species is "H. keuperinus".
Description.
"Hyperokynodon" is known only from two specimens: a holotype snout and a cast of the underside of the skull roof. The holotype was found in Heilbronn, Germany, in the mid-1800s. It likely came from deposits in the Wartberg, a mountain that had several active quarries at the time. The cast, known as SMNS 55910, was found in a sandstone quarry east of the city of Heilbronn. SMNS 55910 is an impression of the underside of the skull table and includes parts of the palate and the edge of the orbit.
Based on the cast, the total skull length is estimated to have been around . The total body length based on related trematosaurs is estimated to have been to . Like other trematosaurids, "Hyperokynodon" has a narrow skull. The back portion, however, is unusually narrow, approaching that of "Cosgriffius", a lonchorhynchine trematosaurid with a very narrow skull. The snout is moderately elongated with a wide tip. The anterior palatal openings, two holes at the front of the palate, are widely spaced. The vomerine and palatal fangs, two sets of teeth on the roof of the mouth, are very large and laterally compressed. "Hyperokynodon" shares several characteristics with the related "Tertrema", such as the absence of teeth between the choanae.
Classification.
The fragmentary nature of specimens belonging to "Hyperokynodon" has led to difficulty in classification. The genus was placed in the capitosaur family Mastodonsauroidea for many decades. In 1987, it was given a more specific classification as a tertremine trematosaurid.
German paleontologist Eberhard Fraas referred SMNS 55910 to the metoposaur "Metopias" in 1889. Schoch "et al." (2002) considered the cast to belong to "H. keuperinus" because it was the only other trematosaurid known from Heilbronn. Schoch "et al." also raised the possibility that it was a lonchorhynchine, which would imply that both the lonchorhynchine and tertremine lineages survived into the Late Triassic. Schoch "et al." considered the cast to belong to a tertremine, however, because of its large size and distinctive features.

Elswick Ordnance Company

The Elswick Ordnance Company (sometimes referred to as Elswick Ordnance Works, but usually as "EOC") was a British armaments manufacturing company of the late 19th and early 20th century
History.
Originally created in 1859 to separate William Armstrong's armaments business from his other business interests, to avoid a conflict of interest as Armstrong was then Engineer of Rifled Ordnance for the War Office and the company's main customer was the British Government. Armstrong held no financial interest in the company until 1864 when he left Government service, and Elswick Ordnance was re-united with the main Armstrong businesses to form Sir W.G. Armstrong & Company. EOC was then the armaments branch of W.G. Armstrong & Company and later of Armstrong Whitworth.
EOC's main customer in its early years was the British Government, but the Government abandoned "Armstrong guns" in the mid-1860s due to dissatisfaction with Armstrong's breech mechanism, and instead built its own rifled muzzle-loaders at Woolwich Arsenal ("Woolwich guns") until 1880. This forced EOC to survive on export orders for both muzzle-loaders and breech-loaders until the 1880s when the British Government again began buying guns from EOC, this time rifled breech-loaders with more robust interrupted screw breech mechanisms such as the de Bange system and its successors.
Elswick Ordnance was a major arms developer before and during World War I. The ordnance and ammunition it manufactured for the British Government were stamped EOC, while guns made for export were usually marked "W.G. Armstrong".

The Feisnecksee or Feisneck is a lake on the southeastern perimeter of the town of Waren in Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It lies at an elevation of 62.1 metres and its surface area is 1.94 km².
The Feisnecksee is joined to the Binnenmüritz to the northwest by a very narrow, shallow and unnavigable ditch. The road runs over a small bridge here that is only wide enough for large vehicles to pass in one direction at a time. The land bridge is about 150 metres wide at this point. The lake is a typical, glacial tunnel valley lake and is divided by a neck and the larger Burgwall Island into a north and south basins. It is about 3,100 metres long and 600 metres wide. Near the southern half is the Waren quarter of Damerow. The lakeshore is completely surrounded by a belt of reed and is also wooded in the south. In the north half of the lake is a bathing area. Fishing is only allowed by special permit because the lake lies in the national park.

The Tiefwarensee is a lake on the northeastern perimeter of the town of Waren (Müritz) in the district of Mecklenburgische Seenplatte in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The lake is separated from the Binnenmüritz to the southwest by a 300 metre wide isthmus. The lake is a glacial tunnel valley lake nestling in an ice-age formed meltwater channel, that runs into Lake Müritz from the north. It has one sizeable bay on its southern shore. It is roughly 2,600 metres long and 780 metres wide. Waren's town centre lies on the southern shore of the lake. The lake thus plays a central role as a recreation area for Waren. For example, there is a canoe and boat hire service on the lake and fishing is also allowed. The Tiefwarensee belongs to the "Torgelower See" nature reserve, and its northeastern shore is part of the Ostufer Tiefwaren – Falkenhäger Bruch Nature Reserve. Power boats and windsurfing are not permitted.

Lydekkerina

Lydekkerina is an extinct genus of stereospondyl temnospondyl. It is the type genus of the family Lydekkerinidae. Fossils have been collected from Early Triassic deposits in South Africa and Australia. The type species is "L. huxleyi", first described in 1889. While most other stereospondyls were semiaquatic, "Lydekkerina" was exclusively terrestrial.
Description.
"Lydekkerina" was a relatively small temnospondyl, growing up to around in length. Skulls range in length from in the smallest known individual to up to in larger individuals. The skull is wedge-shaped and has a parabolic outline with convex lateral margins. Shallow pits cover the surface of the skull. Teeth line the palate as well as the jaws, and some skulls even bear large ectopterygoid tusks on the underside of the skull.
"Lydekkerina" can be distinguished from other lydekkerinids on the basis of several skull characteristics. One such feature is the presence of vomerine shagreen, tiny bumps covering the bones of the palate. An opening at the tip of the palate called the anterior palatal vacuity is divided by two projections of the skull roof, a second distinctive feature of the genus. Moreover, distinctive ridges are present on the underside of the skull roof around the eye sockets, probably to provide structural support.
History and classification.
"Lydekkerina huxleyi" was first briefly described as a species of "Bothriceps" by Richard Lydekker in 1889. The specific name honors Thomas Henry Huxley, an English biologist who named the genus "Bothriceps" in 1859 from material in Australia. Robert Broom, a South African paleontologist, provided a more accurate description of the species in 1915 and reassigned it to the new genus "Lydekkerina", named after Lydekker.
"Lydekkerina" is one of the most common temnospondyls found from the Permo-Triassic Karoo Basin of South Africa. Many fossils have been found from the "Lystrosaurus" Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group. Many, however, are poorly preserved, being crushed or deformed. The variable conditions of specimens has resulted in confusion in identification. Some paleontologists have proposed that variations in skull shape among specimens represent deformities rather than true morphologies. Therefore, characteristics that distinguish different lydekkerinids from one another may be the results of preservation, not taxonomic distinctness. In 2006, it was proposed that the South African lydekkerinids "Limnoiketes" and "Broomulus" were synonymous with "Lydekkerina" for this reason.
A second species of "Lydekkerina", "L. putterilli", was named by Broom in 1930. Its description was based on a small partial skull from the Permian "Dicynodon" Assemblage Zone. It was later considered to be a juvenile rhinesuchid related to "Uranocentrodon". In 2000, "L. putterilli" was assigned to its own genus, "Broomistega".
Broom described a third species, "L. kitchingi", from the "Dicynodon" Assemblage Zone in 1950. In 1996 it was reassigned as a juvenile form of the rhinesuchid "Muchocephalus". In 2003, both "L. kitchingi" and "Muchocephalus" were synonymized with "Laccosaurus".
Temnospondyl remains from the Early Triassic Rewan Formation of Queensland, Australia, were described in 2006 and assigned to "Lydekkerina huxleyi". These remains possess characters diagnostic of "Lydekkerina" such as the ridges underneath the skull roof and the vomerine shagreen.
Paleobiology.
Because the bones of "Lydekkerina" are more heavily ossified than other stereospondyls, it is thought to have been terrestrial. Large bony projections on the skeleton likely served as attachments for strong muscles. Joints between bones were well-developed, enabling effective locomotion on land. The sensory system of pressure-sensitive sulci across the skull is poorly developed, suggesting that "Lydekkerina" had little use for these organs in a land environment. The skeleton of "Lydekkerina" is similar to those of early stereospondyl relatives such as the archegosauroids, but bears little resemblance to those of the exclusively terrestrial Permian temnospondyls.

Kourerpeton

Kourerpeton is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl. Fossils of "Kourerpeton" were discovered in a window of a barber's shop in either Bisbee or Mesa, Arizona. "Kourerpeton" was named in 1976, with the type and only species being "K. bradyi". It was originally assigned to the monotypic family Kourerpetidae, which has been alternatively spelled Kourerpetontidae.
Age and location.
Because it was not found "in situ", the provenance and age of "Kourerpeton" is unknown. The fossils are rumored to have been from the Glen Rose Formation near Glen Rose, Texas. Olson and Lammers (1976) discredited this idea because they noted that the Glen Rose Formation is Cretaceous in age, and therefore not a likely source for a temnospondyl. Several studies have claimed that it is Permian or Early Triassic in age. Warren (1999) suggested that "Kourerpeton" is from an unknown Guadalupian (Middle Permian) to Early Triassic locality in North America, or possibly even from a locality outside North America. Milner and Sequeira (2004) have proposed that "Kourerpeton" may have been from the Early Permian San Angelo Formation in Texas, which has also been the source of the tupilakosaurid "Slaugenhopia". The San Angelo Formation is in close proximity to the Glen Rose Formation, occurring in a north-south belt across north-central Texas about west of Glen Rose.
Classification.
"Kourerpeton" is usually classified in its own dvinosaurian family, the Kourerpetidae. Milner and Sequeira (2004) suggested that "Kourerpeton" may be a tupilakosaurid based on similarities with the genus "Slaugenhopia". Like "Slaugenhopia", "Kourerpeton" possesses enlarged postorbitals and reduced postfrontals, bones that form the portion of the skull roof above the eye sockets. Both "Kourerpeton" and "Slaugenhopia" possess incomplete-ring intercentra, which form the cenra of vertebrae. The pleurocentra, which also comprise the centra, are slender and crescentic in both genera. Unlike "Slaugenhopia", "Kourerpeton" lacks an incisure, or notch, on the pterygoid bone of the palate. In "Slaugenhopia", this incisure appears as a deep notch in the posterior margin of the central palate. In "Kourerpeton", the posterior edge of the skull table is strongly undulated, and has a medial concavity. This is unlike "Slaugenhopia", which has a relatively straight skull roof margin. Based on these differences, Milner and Sequeira (2004) considered "Kourerpeton" to be a primitive stem-tupilakosaurid.

Tony Kaldas

Tony Kaldas (in Arabic طونى قلدس ) is a young Egyptian singer, trained for both opera and Arabic, classical and light singing. He was featured in concerts in Egypt.
Biography.
Tony Kaldas, was born in Cairo, Egypt 1984, in the heart of Cairo in Al Zaher, from a Greek-Egyptian mother and an Egyptian-Palestinian father. Since childhood, the family was keen to educate the children about famous singers and musicians from around the Arab world; voices of Asmahan, Um Kalthoum, Abdel Wahab, Fairouz and Farid al-Atrash were constantly heard in the house. The father was an engineer who loved art and enjoyed painting at home, but also admired various families of music, movies and theatre and filled his library with collections of books and records. The father's passion for poetry and reading also reflected in full collections of poetry for Ahmed Shawky, Hafez Ibrahim, Nizar Kabbani and el Khayyam. The mother was a dedicated housewife, and mother of three who tended the children with good education. Her knowledge of many languages also introduced the English, French and Greek music and poetry to the house.
Tony was the last child, after an older brother and sister. During his early childhood his favorite activity was dancing to music and waking up early to play his favorite records, which helped him decide his own taste and favorites from the vast genres available at home. His father encouraged this talent by enrolling him in violin classes. Violin training was the critical element to learning to read scores; a key enabler for entry into professional singing later on.
French schooling was the standard in the family, and Tony joined the College des Frères. School enabled Tony to join a young Choir since early years, which was the first start into singing. Quickly, Tony's talent showed in the Choir and eventually he was assigned solo singing. His mentors encouraged him to seek ways to develop this talent further.
After finishing high school, Tony went to studying engineering, reducing the study of music to a part-time activity temporarily. Graduating with honors.
Tony decided to take his music education to a professional level, and was able to do that through joining the independent Open Course at the Cairo Opera House; following in the footsteps of his favorite singer Asmahan who used her Opera training as a unique capacity in Arabic singing unequalled till today. His first teacher Dr. Taheya Shams el Din discovered his special talent and gave him special attention and complex arias and operas to practice using his unique voice, which she identified to be bari-tenor or dramatic tenor – a voice that combines the high range of musical notes of a tenor, yet with the depth of a baritone voice. She supported him further by introducing him to various pieces of music and presenting him at the Opera House Open Course recitals and which led to his first public performance at Ghouri House as part of the Charles Aznavour celebration sponsored by the Ministry of Culture.
Dr. Iman Moustafa took Tony under her auspices following Dr. Taheya, and started helping him discover new ranges in his voice, including exploration of his extreme upper range – the counter-tenor – which gave him stronger control over his voice range. Eventually, she gave him full support during his first public performances. Tony’s favorite singing style, however, tended away from opera and more towards classical Arabic and light which dominated his latest performances at the Opera House Gomhoreya Theatre and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.
Tony voice's ability reached high ability to interpret difficult genres and various styles from all over the world supported by his big register as a baritenor
Besides singing, Tony learnt to play the guitar. He was able to demonstrate strong skill to both sing and play the guitar during one of his recent concerts.
Tony is also a big fan of literature. His library features a collection of classical literature books such as Homer, Dante and Shakespeare full works. Tony also reads in Sufism, poetry and philosophy, which all shaped his choice of singing lyrics and topics of his concerts. Gibran Khalil Gibran’s Sufi poems were of particular interest as featured in his concerts.
Career.
Tony sang cover versions of songs sung by the Arabic Super-stars :Fairuz, Abdel Halim Hafez, Mohamed Abdel Wahab, Umm Kulthum, Nour el Hoda etc... and from the Worldwide he used to sing for Charles Aznavour, Édith Piaf, Mireille Mathieu, Frédéric François, Jacques Brel, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, etc..

Augmented tuning

An augmented tuning is a tuning system for musical instruments that is associated with augmented triads, that is a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth. The augmented fifth is constructed by stacking the major third with another major third. Consequently, all of the intervals are major thirds.
Augmented tunings are used for stringed instruments, especially guitars, and for wind instruments. For guitars, augmented tunings are called major thirds tunings.
Instruments.
Guitar.
Major-thirds (M3) tunings are unconventional open tunings, in which the open strings form an augmented triad; in M3 tunings, the "augmented" fifth replaces the "perfect" fifth of the major triad of conventional open-tunings. Consequently M3 tunings are also called (open) "augmented-fifth tunings" (in French ""La guitare #5, majeure quinte augmentée""). Unfortunately, the open augmented-chord sounds dissonant to audiences who are accustomed to standard tuning.
Wind.
For a diatonic wind instrument (such as a harmonica or accordion), the blow notes repeat a sequence of
(perhaps shifted to begin with E♭ or with G) and draw notes follow a repeating sequence of
though perhaps with a different initial sequence.

West Cork oil spill

The West Cork oil spill was an oil spill off the southern coast of Ireland. The spill was first identified by the European Maritime Safety Agency's CleanSeaNet satellite monitoring system on 14 February 2009. An Irish Air Corps marine patrol aircraft first spotted the slick around the which was undergoing refuelling around the same time. The Russian Navy have since accepted responsibility for the incident. The oil spill began heading eastwards and broke up. Whilst there were fears that the spill would wash up on the coast of south eastern Ireland or Wales this is no longer the case due to the spill breaking up.
Discovery.
On 14 February 2009, the Irish Coast Guard received a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) satellite surveillance report indicating the presence of pollution off the south coast of Ireland. The Coast Guard dispatched an Irish Air Corps CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft to investigate which confirmed the presence of oil on the surface of the sea around a Russian Navy oil tanker and the "Admiral Kuznetsov" aircraft carrier. The spill was located in international waters 80 km (50 mi) south of Fastnet Rock, Ireland's most southwesterly point, and spread over an area measuring 6.4 km (4 mi) by 8 km (5 mi).
On 16 February, the Russian naval attaché in Ireland confirmed that the carrier had been carrying out replenishment of fuel at sea from a Russian supply tanker. The attaché confirmed an internal investigation is being carried out into the cause of the incident and said that Russian aerial surveillance considered that approximately 300 tonnes of oil was on the sea surface but could not tell how this happened or whether it was from their refuelling operations. The Russian Navy offered no explanation for the presence of the oil but began an internal investigation into the matter. Admiral Korolev, the commander of the Russian ships has stated that the refuelling proceeded in a routine manner and that there had been no leaks. The Russian Navy says that it is willing to share data in an attempt to identify the origin of the spill which it says is "not catastrophic in nature and does not present a threat to the coastal environment". The "Admiral Kuznetsov" is normally accompanied by at least one ocean-going tug in case of breakdown. On this occasion, she was also accompanied by the . The carrier was en route to its home port following exercises in the Mediterranean Sea where, on 6 January, it suffered a fire which resulted in the death of one sailor.
The British Coastguard initially estimated the quantity of oil spilled as around 1,000 tonnes, later revised down to 522 and then to 300 tonnes, a figure with which the Irish Department of Transport agreed. If the original 1,000 tonnes estimate was proven accurate then this oil spill would be the biggest to have affected Great Britain and Ireland since the ran aground near Milford Haven in 1996.
Slick movement.
Late on 17 February 2009, the estimated amount of oil was revised downwards to 522 tonnes and it was off the Irish coast. The slick had broken into three streams and was moving eastwards along Ireland's south coast, at a distance of around 48–64 km (30-40 mi) offshore. On 18 February changing wind patterns and unexpected mild weather had pushed the oil slick, which had not moved significantly since the evening before, further from shore. The Irish Coast Guard ran computer simulations of the spill and expected some oil to dissolve or evaporate. Depending on weather conditions, the spill could have washed up onto the Irish south-east coast in late February and may hit Wales shortly after. On 20 February, however, the spill was reported to be moving very slowly eastwards and the Irish Coast Guard said that it was possible that the slick may avoid the Irish coast completely, owing to favourable winds. By 23 February the spill was moving eastwards at just five nautical miles per day and was south of Cork harbour and continuing to disperse. As of 25 February the slick is expected to move northwards and away from the Irish coastline whilst continuing to disperse and break up. The Coast Guard no longer expects the slick to make landfall before disintegrating unless wind direction and speed change unexpectedly.
Environmental impact.
The spill threatens birds, dolphins, porpoises and seals that are native to Ireland's south coast. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) Aquaculture division called on the relevant local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that shellfish farmers in counties Cork, Wexford and Waterford were protected. According to the IFA, over 25% of national production of mussels and oysters are cultivated in this area. The Bord Iascaigh Mhara (Irish Fisheries Board) is also testing wild and farmed shellfish on the southern coast as a precautionary measure. Both the Irish and Russian authorities have stated that so far the spill has not affected fishing areas or coastal habitats.
Responses.
Irish Coast Guard.
Both , a British destroyer, and , an Irish Naval Service vessel responded to the scene. The Russian vessels left the area around 18 February, having completed refuelling. Samples of the oil were taken for analysis at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's (MCA) labs in Edinburgh, and Ireland has requested samples of oils carried on board the Russian vessels from the Russian Embassy in Dublin. The Irish Coast Guard contracted a tug, the "Celtic Isle", equipped with oil dispersal equipment from a Cork based company. The tug assessed and attempted to deploy skimmers on 18 February, but the Irish Coast Guard director has said that international experience showed that success could be very limited. “Unless this fuel oil can be sprayed within the first day of a spill, it is very difficult to deal with, and collection at sea has a success rate of about 1%”. The "Celtic Isle" was stood down by 26 February after recovery of the oil met with little success. The EMSA’s pollution response vessel for this Atlantic region, the "Galway Fisher", also made its way to Cork to take on board anti-pollution equipment and remain on stand-by. The MCA laboratory confirmed that the oil involved was a light crude oil on 21 or 22 February. Further test results announced on 26 February revealed the oil to have come from Russia.
Local authorities.
It was reported that both the British and Irish governments had drafted emergency plans for the cleaning of any affected coasts. Oil washed up in Ireland was due to be recovered mechanically by local authorities using bulldozers and skimmers with the assistance and supervision of the Coast Guard. By 23 February it was reported that none of the Wexford, Waterford or Cork local authorities had completed oil pollution response plans as required by law since 1999, but Wexford's plan was almost complete.
Russian Navy.
On 20 February the Russian military stated that it believed that the spill might have been caused during cleaning of the deck of the "Admiral Kuznetsov". They dispatched a high-level diplomatic delegation to Ireland to discuss the impact of the spill. The delegation included experts in the field and Vice-Admiral Popov, the deputy commander of the Russian Navy. They met with the Irish Minister of State for the Department of Transport, Noel Ahern, and Irish Coast Guard officials on 23 February. The discussions included an assessment of the cost of recovery of the oil and the determination of liability for the spill.
On 24 February, 10 days after the initial spill, the Russian delegation admitted, with extreme regret, responsibility for the incident. The high-level Russian military delegation told the Irish Coast Guard that the incident may have occurred when bilges were inadvertently pumped out 80 km southeast of Fastnet Rock. The Russian internal investigation stated that "technical malfunction and human error" were the causes of the spill. The Irish and Russian governments still disagree over the size of the spill. The Russian Navy estimates it at 20 to 30 tons whilst the Irish Coast Guard estimates 300 tons.
The Irish Coast Guard expressed disappointment that notification of the pollution incident had not been made earlier as earlier notification would have facilitated spraying and reduced potential risk. However, Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds said he accepted the delegation’s explanation. The total cost of the monitoring operation is estimated at €250,000, which the Russian Federation may contribute towards. This will depend on bilateral discussions between the Russian Federation and the Irish Government.

Seznam.cz

Seznam.cz (or just "Seznam", which means "list" in English) is a web portal and search engine in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1996 by Ivo Lukačovič in Prague as the first web portal in the Czech Republic. Seznam started with a search engine and an internet version of yellow pages. Today, Seznam runs more than 15 different web services and associated brands. Seznam had more than 4 million exclusive visitors per month at the end of 2008. Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are Seznam homepage, Seznam Email, Seznam Search and Seznam yellow pages.
In the Czech market, Seznam.cz was until 2008 in competition with the portals Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz. These two portals, despite merging in 2008, no longer appear likely to overcome Seznam in the near future. Seznam's biggest competitor now appears to be global Google, especially in the area of full-text search.
As of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam is the second internet search engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%).
Seznam, like four other companies in the world, was for a long time the number one search engine in its region. Other such search engines are Baidu (China), Naver (South Korea), Yahoo Japan (Japan) and Yandex (Russia).
Since 2011, Seznam has used as its slogan a Czech rhyme "Seznam - najdu tam, co hledám" ("Seznam - I find there, what I search for"). Prior to this its slogan was "Seznam - najdu tam, co neznám" ("Seznam - I find there, what I don't know").
History.
Founded by Ivo Lukačovič in 1996, Seznam began as the first internet yellow pages and search engine in the Czech Republic. Ivo started his business with 50,000 CZK he had saved up. In 1998, Seznam added email to its portfolio, with email accounts running on the "@seznam.cz" domain. Since then, more brands and services have come on-line. Since 2001, Seznam has included financial, social and political news, TV programs, weather forecasts, dictionaries, maps and community services.
In 2000, Spray International, a Swedish web portal company, invested in Seznam. At that time Seznam became a joint stock company. Until 2000, Ivo Lukačovič was self-employed and Seznam was his own sole business. With the investment, it is estimated that Spray International acquired around 30% share of Seznam. Exact numbers are not known, as Lukačovič and Seznam officials have never released any details about the transaction. What has been confirmed, though, is that Ivo Lukačovič retained at least 70% of Seznam stock after the investment.
Spray acquired a stake in Seznam with the intention of making an IPO; however, Spray never reached that goal. After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Spray abandoned the idea. There are rumors about Spray defaulting on its obligations to Ivo Lukačovič by not making an IPO. In 2003, Ivo Lukačovič increased the base capital of Seznam without Spray and became 70% owner of Seznam. Since 2003, Ivo Lukačovič has remained the controlling shareholder of Seznam.
Until 2003, Seznam had been using a fulltext engine from the Czech company Jyxo; however, in 2005, Seznam replaced that search engine with its own technology. Also in 2005, Seznam acquired the Czech firm ATC which was, among other ventures, running the email server Email.cz. Email services Email.cz and Seznam.cz have now merged.
In 2006, Seznam moved its headquarters from Prague Košíře to a more prominent location in the Prague Anděl. That year, Ivo Lukačovič gave up the day-to-day business direction of Seznam, and Pavel Zima became CEO. In the Fall of 2006, Seznam acquired all email users from another web portal, "Czech On Line", with the domain "@post.cz".
Seznam bought 50% of Global Inspiration, a Czech company running a video portal Stream.cz, similar to the global YouTube in 2007. Lycos Europe (a subsequent incarnation of Spray International) sold its 30% share in Seznam to Tiger Holding and Miura International. Lycos received more than 1.7 billion CZK from this transaction.
In 2008, the Czech media reported on alleged meetings between Seznam and Goldman Sachs representatives to find a buyer for Seznam. Ivo Lukačovič and Seznam representatives denied this. Such speculation ended with the start of the financial crisis in Europe in late 2008.
Assessment.
Seznam uses its own ranking scale for web pages, called S-Rank. It is a similar to PageRank with a range from 0 to 10.

Diane Holland

Diane Holland (28 February 1930 – 24 January 2009) was a British actress.
She was unmarried and trained as a dancer before being given the part of Yvonne Stewart-Hargreaves in "Hi-de-Hi!" (1980) by her brother-in-law, Jimmy Perry. Jimmy, who co-wrote "Hi-de-hi!", married Diane's sister Gilda, and saw Diane's talent. She also played the recurring role of Sarah Maynard in "Crossroads" from 1964-70.
At the peak of "Hi-de-Hi!" in the '80s, Diane received a letter from a troop in the Falklands and it "just snowballed". She became a forces sweetheart. 
Following "Hi-de-Hi!", in 1990, she appeared in Central Television's comedy "The Upper Hand".
Diane also played, in 1992 and 1993, the notoriously outrageous female Magistrate, Celia Littlewood, in "Grace and Favour", the sequel to the long running comedy, "Are You Being Served". One of her last appearances included "The Nutcracker" in Covent Garden. She also appeared in "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em" as a maternity hospital receptionist.
She lived in Godstone, Surrey and died on 24 January 2009 at the age of 78 after suffering from bronchial pneumonia. The news of her death was not made public until more than three weeks later.

<doc id="21577374" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21577374" title="Rhynchonkos">
Rhynchonkos

Rhynchonkos is an extinct genus of microsaur. It is the only member of the family Goniorhynchidae. Originally known as "Goniorhynchus", it was renamed in 1981. The type and only species is "R. stovalli", found from the Early Permian Hennesey Formation in Cleveland County, Oklahoma. "Rhynchonkos" shares many similarities with "Eocaecilia", an early caecilian from the Early Jurassic of Arizona. The close similarity between "Rhynchonkos" and "Eocaecilia" may be an indication that caecilians are descendants of microsaurs. However, such a relationship is no longer widely accepted.
Description.
"Rhynchonkos" has an elongated body with at least 37 presacral vertebrae. Most vertebrae have ribs. Unlike other microsaurs, the atlas of "Rhynchonkos" lacks ribs. Both "Rhynchonkos" and "Euryodus" have atlases that bear a strong resemblance to those of nectrideans. Like nectrideans, the arch of the atlas is attached to the centrum, although this is likely the result of convergence. 
The skull is triangular in dorsal view. The limbs are very small. It has a pointed, overhanging snout that extends beyond the tooth row. There are five or six premaxillary teeth and sixteen maxillary teeth, all of which are narrow and peg-shaped. The palate also has teeth, with rows on the ectopterygoid, palatine, and vomer. The bones of the skull roof are similar to those of gymnarthrids. There are two rows of teeth adjacent to one another in the lower jaw, with a marginal row on the dentary and an inner row on the coronoid.
Classification.
"Rhynchonkos" was first described as "Goniorhynchus" by Olson (1970). However, the name "Goniorhynchus" was preoccupied by an Indian moth named in 1896. Because of this preoccupation, it was renamed "Rhynchonkos" by Schultze and Foreman (1981). "Rhynchonkos" was first described as a gymnarthrid, but has since been placed in its own family, Goniorhynchidae. Goniorhynchidae was named before "Rhynchonkos" was given as a replacement name for the genus, and the name Rhynchonkidae has been used as a replacement name for the family in some studies.
Relationship to caecilians.
"Rhynchonkos" shares many features with the early caecilian "Eocaecilia", including an elongated snout, small limbs, and a similar skull. Based on these features, caecilians seemed to have originated from "Rhynchonkos" or another closely related microsaur. Carroll and Currie (1975), the first to suggest this possible relationship, noted similarities in temporal fenestration, palatal structure, braincase composition, and mandibular dentition. In the temporal region of the skulls of "Rhynchonkos" and caecilians, the number of bones are reduced. Both "Rhynchonkos" and caecilians possess a primitive combination of palatal bones, including the ectopterygoid. The two taxa also have rows of teeth on the palate in addition to the marginal rows on the maxilla and premaxilla. Carrol and Currie also mentioned that "Rhynchonkos" and caecilians have a pleurosphenoid that joins the otic-occipital portion of the braincase with the sphenethmoid, a characteristic which they considered unique among amphibians. The adjacent tooth rows on the coronoid and the dentary of "Rhynchonkos" were also considered a characteristic that linked it with caecilians. 
Despite these similarities, many of the characteristics that suggested a close relationship between "Rhynchonkos" and caecilians have since been considered primitive, convergent, or indeterminate. For example, tooth rows on the palate have evolved multiple times independently in early amphibians. The general appearance of "Rhynchonkos" is similar to that of caecilians, but is also similar to other amphibians that have independently developed elongated bodies. Adelospondyls, lysorophians, aïstopods, and some salamanders all have an increased number of vertebrae that lengthen the body. Reduced limbs are seen in many aquatic or burrowing amphibians, and are not unique to microsaurs and caecilians.

A single specimen is known, collected from the Texas Permian redbeds by Charles Hazelius Sternberg in 1917. It was originally identified as a specimen of the gymnarthrid microsaur "Cardiocephalus". The skull is small, less than in length, and the otic capsule (a hollow region of bone encapsulating the inner ear) is very large in comparison to the rest of the skull. The skull of "Quasicaecilia" superficially resembles those of extant but unrelated caecilians, hence the genus name. "Quasicaecilia" was assigned to the new family Brachystelechidae in 1991 along with the genera "Batropetes" and "Carrolla".

The fossil frogs are assumed to have died following a degassing event (possibly of CO2) by the volcano.
The existence of fossil specimens was discovered accidentally in the late 1970s during prospecting of the volcanic kimberlite pipe for diamonds by de Beers Mining Company. Specimens of "Vulcanobatrachus mandelai" are curated by Iziko Museums, Gardens, Cape Town.

"Xenotosuchus" in life.
Like many mastodontosaurids, it was a large animal with a large head. It's amphibian life history meant that the distinct shape of the skull roof would change from a general tadpole-like skull type through to the distinct adult shape. The head bones are covered in large pits and grooves, indicating extensive dermal armour on the head. Both the upper and lower jaw had tusks, those of the upper jaw being situated on a 2nd row of teeth on the vomer and palatine bone. Contrary to related forms like "Mastodonsaurus", the tusks of the lower jaw were of moderate size and did not penetrate the premaxilla.

Warren and Trumbull Railroad

The Warren and Trumbull Railroad is a part of the Ohio Central Railroad System, which was bought by Genesee & Wyoming Inc. in 2008, operating three lines in and near Warren. It began operations in 1994 on a line formerly operated by CSX Transportation, and expanded in 1996 on two ex-Conrail lines.
All WTRM-operated lines are owned by the nonprofit Economic Development Rail II Corporation (EDR-II). The WTRM however owns several lines that are leased to the affiliated Youngstown Belt Railroad.
History.
The first line of the WTRM extended from a CSX connection at Deforest Junction, near Deforest Road, through Warren to the Warren Steel plant. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved abandonment by CSX in 1993, after which the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Corporation formed EDR-II to buy the ex-Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, which had been built by the Painesville and Youngstown Railroad in the 1870s; the WTRM began operations in March 1994. EDR-II subsequently acquired two lines from Conrail in 1996, with operation by the WTRM under trackage rights. One line, extending north from a Conrail (now Youngstown Belt Railroad, with Norfolk Southern Railway trackage rights) connection in Warren, was opened in 1873 by the Ashtabula, Youngstown and Pittsburgh Railroad, a Pennsylvania Railroad predecessor, and the other, extending west from the same junction, and crossing the original line in Warren, was opened by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, an Erie Railroad predecessor, as part of a main line to Dayton in 1863. The original line (ex-B&O) south of the crossing with the new east-west line (ex-Erie) was abandoned the next year, since all traffic was overhead, and had moved to the new lines.
The WTRM bought outright a number of lines in 1996, and later that year leased a connecting ex-B&O line near Youngstown from CSX. Effective January 1, 1997, the Youngstown Belt Railroad began operating this trackage under lease.

Pangerpeton is an extinct genus of amphibian. Its monotypic species is "Pangerpeton sinensis".
"Pangerpeton" is a metamorphosed, primitive salamander from the ?Late Jurassic Daohugou fossil bed near Wubaiding Village of Lingyuan City, Liaoning Province, China. 
Yuan Wang and Susan E. Evans (2006) named this new taxon with a phylogenetic analysis of caudates at familial level including fossil taxa, such as "Marmorerpeton", "Karaurus", "Jeholotriton", "Chunerpeton", "Liaoxitriton", "Iridotriton", and "Valdotriton". The analysis placed "Pangerpeton" as a sister taxon to "Jeholotriton" from the equivalent fossil bed, and the two are close to the base of crown−group Urodela either just outside it or just within.
This Jurassic amphibian is characterized by its short trunk (only 14 presacrals) and short and wide head, giving a fat body shape, from which the genus name was derived ("Pang" means fat in Chinese).

Norah Elam

Norah Elam also known as Norah Dacre Fox, (née Norah Doherty, 1878–1961) was a radical feminist, militant suffragette, anti-vivisectionist and fascist in the United Kingdom. Born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1878 to John and Charlotte Doherty, she emigrated to England with her family and by 1891 was living in London. Norah married Charles Richard Dacre Fox in 1909.
Political activity.
Mrs Dacre Fox was a prominent member of the Women's Social and Political Union and served as general secretary. Between May and July 1914 she was imprisoned three times in Holloway Prison for 'acts of terrorism'; she received a WSPU hunger strike medal with three bars.
In 1918 she stood as an independent candidate in Richmond (Surrey) for election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom but was not elected. The same year Norah campaigned for the internment of enemy aliens in collaboration with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Norah Elam stated publicly in "The Times" that she was never a member of the Women's Freedom League (contrary to some reports).
Norah Elam claimed to be a founding member of the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society (LPAVS). Documentary evidence of this has not been found, but it is known that she was a member from about the time of its inception circa 1900. In the 1930s she had published under the auspices of the LPAVS two pamphlets: "The MRC: What it is and How it Works" and "The Vitamin Survey". The pamphlets were widely distributed throughout the UK, including public libraries.
By the 1930s, Norah had separated from her husband, and was living with Edward Descou Dudley Vallance Elam whose surname she adopted. They lived in Sussex where they were active in the local Conservative Party however they defected to Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists soon after its creation in 1932 and Norah became prominent in the women's section. Norah was a frequent contributor to the Fascist press and in 1937 was put forward as a candidate for the British Union of Fascists for the Northampton constituency, but, because of the war, the election never took place. Mosley used Norah's suffragette past to counter the criticism that National Socialism was anti-feminist saying that her prospective candidacy "killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back in the home". In 1940 Norah and Dudley Elam were arrested as Defence Regulation 18B detainees and Norah was interned in Holloway Prison with several other female fascists including Diana Mosley.
Family.
She had one son, Evelyn (born 1922). Her granddaughter, Angela McPherson, described in a BBC documentary that she had no idea until 2002 of the role Elam played at the centre of the fascist movement. Angela knew that Elam had been a suffragette who claimed to have been close to the Pankhursts; a sudden decision to search online for information about Norah Elam started to throw up information she had not been aware of. Angela felt that she had subconsciously blocked out disturbing memories of the stories her grandmother told her as a child, which were to affect her family. She described Elam as a "dreadful racist." They feel that she emotionally damaged her son, turning him into a "bullying misogynist" imitation of Norah's own father. A biography "Mosley's Old Suffragette" has been written by Susan McPherson and Angela McPherson.

Trimerorhachis

Trimerorhachis is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl within the family Trimerorhachidae. It is known from the Early Permian of the southwestern United States, with most fossil specimens having been found in Texas (its fossils are very common in the north-central part of the state). The type species of "Trimerorhachis", "T. insignis", was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. Cope named a second species from Texas, "T. mesops", in 1896. The species "T. rogersi" (named in 1955) and "T. greggi" (named in 2013) are also from Texas, and the species "T. sandovalensis" (named in 1980) is from New Mexico.
Description.
The length of the largest specimens of "Trimerorhachis" is estimated to have been almost a metre (3.3 feet) in length. "Trimerorhachis" has a large triangular head with upward-facing eyes positioned near the front of the skull. The trunk is long and the limbs are relatively short. The presence of a branchial apparatus indicates that "Trimerorhachis" had external gills in life, much like the modern axolotl. The body of "Trimerorhachis" is also completely covered by small and very thin osteoderms, which overlap and can be up to 20 layers thick. These osteoderms act as an armor-like covering, especially around the tail. Their weight may have helped "Trimerorhachis" sink to the bottom of lakes and rivers where it would feed.
History.
"Trimerorhachis" was first described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. Specimens are often preserved as masses of bones that are mixed together and densely packed in slabs of rock. Fossils are rarely found in articulation, although a slab of rock has been found with sixteen skulls and their associated vertebrae in an intact position. Most of these fossils preserve skulls and dorsal vertebrae, but rarely any other bones. Paleontologist S.W. Williston of the University of Chicago commented in 1915 that "it will only be by the fortunate discovery of a connected skeleton that the tail, ribs, and feet will be made known." A nearly complete specimen was discovered the following year near Seymour, Texas, and Williston was able to describe the entire postcranial skeleton of "Trimerorhachis".
In 1955, paleontologist Edwin Harris Colbert described the scales of "Trimerorhachis". He noted that they were oval-shaped and overlapping and that each had a base layer of longitudinal striations covered by another layer ring-like ridges, the growth rings of the scales. The scales were more similar to fish scales than they were to reptile scales. In 1979, paleontologist Everett C. Olson claimed that there were no such scales in "Trimerorhachis", and that Colbert was incorrect in his interpretation of the body covering of "Trimerorhachis".
A second species called "T. sandovalensis" was named from New Mexico in 1980. A nearly complete skeleton from the Abo Formation near Jemez Springs has been designated the holotype, but other fossils of the species are found throughout the state, giving it a wide distribution.
Paleobiology.
Environment.
"Trimerorhachis" was a fully aquatic temnospondyl. Like most dvinosaurs, it had external gills. The interclavicle and clavicle of the pectoral girdle are both very large, a feature that is shared with other aquatic temnospondyls. Many bones are poorly ossified, indicating that "Trimerorhachis" was poorly suited for movement on land. "Trimerorhachis" was probably an aquatic predator that fed on fish and small vertebrates.
During the Early Permian, the area of New Mexico and Texas was a broad coastal plain that stretched from an ocean in the south to highlands in the north. Other common animals that lived alongside "Trimerorhachis" included lungfish and crossopterygians, the lepospondyl "Diplocaulus", and the large sail-backed synapsid "Dimetrodon".
Brooding.
Small bones that likely belong to immature "Trimerorhachis" individuals have been found in the pharyngeal pouches of larger "Trimerorhachis" specimens. At first these bones were thought to be part of the branchial arches which surround the pouch, or remains of prey that had just been eaten before the animal died. If "Trimerorhachis" was a mouth brooder, the closest living analogue would be Darwin's Frog, which broods its young in its vocal sac. The bones in "Trimerorhachis" belong to juveniles that were much larger than those of Darwin's Frog, however. The young of the Gastric-brooding frog of Australia are comparable in size to those of "Trimerorhachis" but are brooded in the stomach rather than the throat. The number of brooded young in Darwin's Frog and the Gastric-brooding frog is also much higher than that of "Trimerorhachis", as only a few individuals can be distinguished in the collection of bones. The only living amphibian that raises similarly sized young is the Golden coquí, although it does so through ovovivipary rather than brooding.
Another possible explanation for the small bones is that they were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch during fossilization. If this was the case, "Trimerorhachis" may have eaten its young instead of brooding them. This type of cannibalism is widespread in living amphibians, and most likely occurred among some prehistoric amphibians as well.

Thoosuchus

Thoosuchus is an extinct genus of basal trematosauroid trematosaurian temnospondyl. Fossils have been found from Russia and date back to the Early Triassic. It is the type genus of the family Thoosuchidae, formerly called the subfamily Thoosuchinae and placed within Benthosuchidae. The benthosuchids were originally composed of the majority of basal trematosaurian forms regarded as the ancestors of the trematosaurids. Although the genus was first named in 1940, material from one species, "E. yakovlevi", was originally tentatively referred to "Trematosuchus" in 1926.
For its family, "Thoosuchus" was fairly small, reaching a little over 60 cm with a 15 cm skull.
"Thoosuchus" superficially resembles the more derived trematosaurids, but can be distinguished from them on the basis of a deep, narrowing otic notch. It had widely spaced orbits and a moderately elongated skull roof that was well ornamented with ridges and grooves, especially on the parietals. This ornamentation is also a characteristic of trematosaurids and has been described as representing a "zone of intensive growth". The well developed lateral line system of "Thoosuchus" is indicative of its presumed aquatic lifestyle.

Utaherpeton

Utaherpeton is an extinct genus of lepospondyl amphibian from the Carboniferous of Utah. It is one of the oldest and possibly one of the most basal ("primitive") known lepospondyls. The genus is monotypic, including only the type species Utaherpeton franklini. "Utaherpeton" was named in 1991 from the Manning Canyon Shale Formation, which dates to the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary. It was originally classified within Microsauria, a group of superficially lizard- and salamander-like lepospondyls that is now no longer considered to be a valid clade or evolutionary grouping, but rather an evolutionary grade consisting of the most basal lepospondyls. "Utaherpeton" has been proposed as both the most basal lepospondyl and the oldest "microsaur", although more derived lepospondyls are known from earlier in the Carboniferous. However, its position within Lepospondyli remains uncertain due to the incomplete preservation of the only known specimen. The inclusion of "Utaherpeton" in various phylogenetic analyses has resulted in multiple phylogenies (hypotheses of evolutionary relationships) that are very different from one another, making it a significant taxon in terms of understanding the interrelationships of lepospondyls.
Description.
Like many other lepospondyls, "Utaherpeton" is salamander-like in appearance. It has an elongated body made up of 26 presacral (neck and back) vertebrae. The total body length excluding the tail is about . The forelimbs are markedly smaller than the hind limbs and the hind feet are unusual in that they are larger than the rest of the hind limbs. A unique anatomical feature that distinguishes "Utaherpeton" from other "microsaur" lepospondyls is a connection between the prefrontal and premaxilla bones at the front of the skull.
Classification.
When "Utaherpeton" was first described in 1991, it was tentatively classified within a group of "microsaurs" called Microbrachomorpha, which included the better-known "Microbrachis". A 2001 phylogenetic analysis found "Utaherpeton" to be the most basal lepospondyl, followed by the "microsaur" "Hyloplesion", which has also been considered a microbrachomorph. However, Microbrachomorpha was not recognized as a true clade because "Microbrachis" was found to be more deeply nested within Lepospondyli, more closely related to derived lepospondyls like nectrideans and aïstopods than to other "microsaurs". A 2004 analysis including "Utaherpeton" produced a very different phylogeny for lepospondyls, placing aïstopods and nectrideans as the most basal lepospondyls, followed by a paraphyletic assemblage of "microsaurs". "Utaherpeton" was still recovered as one of the most basal "microsaurs", but not as the most basal lepospondyl. Tentative support for a close relationship between "Utaherpeton" and "Microbrachis" was also found. In a 2010 analysis, all "microsaurs" except "Utaherpeton" were recovered within a monophyletic group, but "Utaherpeton" was found to be the most basal member of a separate clade that included all other lepospondyls.

Survivor Philippines

Survivor Philippines is the Philippine version of the television series "Survivor", which was originally based from the show, "Expedition Robinson" created in 1997 by Charlie Parsons. The series premiered on September 15, 2008 on GMA Network. The show is currently hosted by Richard Gutierrez. The first two seasons were hosted by Paolo Bediones. It is aired by GMA Network on weekday nights during the primetime Telebabad timeslot. Since , it is shown internationally through GMA Pinoy TV except in North America, due to Castaway Television's contract with CBS that prevents other countries' versions of the series to be aired in that region.
Like many of its counterparts, the show has a set number of contestants stranded on an isolated area for a pre-determined number of days until one remains and is given the title "Pinoy Sole Survivor" ("Celebrity Sole Survivor" for the celebrity editions). Aside from the title, the winner also receives P3,000,000 (around US$65,000), the largest ever cash prize in the history of Philippine reality game shows.
The show's tagline is ""Pautakan, Pagalingan, Patatagan"", the Filipino translation of the U.S. version's ""Outwit, Outplay, Outlast"". The show, in general, refers their fans as a ""Katribo"", which means ""tribemate"" in English.
Format.
In the game, a number of contestants, referred in the show as the "castaways", are split into tribes and assigned separate camps at the filming's location, typically a tropical setting. As a tribe, the castaways must survive the elements, construct shelter, build fire, look for water, and scrounge for food and other necessities for the entire filming period, around 39 days (36 in recent celebrity seasons). In the first half of the game, the tribes face off in challenges, some for rewards of food, shelter, or luxury items, while others are for immunity, preventing the winning tribe from having to go to the next Tribal Council. Tribes that do go to Tribal Council discuss the events of the last few days with the host asking questions, and then must vote out one of their own players, eliminating them from the game.
In the second half of the game, the tribes are merged into a single tribe. Challenges are played at an individual level for individual rewards and immunity. At subsequent Tribal Councils, those eliminated start to form the jury, who sit in on all subsequent Tribal Councils but otherwise do not participate. When only two or three castaways remain, those castaways attend a final Tribal Council, where the jury is given the opportunity to ask them questions. After this, the jury members then vote to decide which of the remaining castaways should be declared Sole Survivor.
Seasons.
Season details.
There have been four seasons of the show:
Deviations.
While the show was aired on a daily basis rather than once a week, all elements of the "Survivor" franchise were otherwise present. The show uses the theme music for the British version composed by Russ Landau, who made the "Ancient Voices" series of theme scores for the American version. It has further been re-arranged and added with tribal and ethnic flavors by local Filipino composer Diwa de Leon and chant vocals were performed by Evan Britanico.
One unique difference in this franchise is in the status of castaways who are evacuated to the hospital nearest to the setting of the game. Instead of being declared as eliminated at the point of evacuation, a castaway being sent to the hospital due to apparent injury or ailment is reminded to return to the game within 24 hours; otherwise, they are officially declared as eliminated from the game. One exception was with "Survivor Philippines: Celebrity Doubles Showdown" castaway, Stef Prescott, who had been brought to a hospital in Manila after she was bitten by a Philippine cobra at Bulan camp. She was on treatment and observation for two days. Throughout the two day absence from the game, she missed the actual Tribal Shuffle twist, a Tribal Immunity Challenge, and a Tribal Council. She came back on Day 13. Of the eight castaways across four seasons so far who were sent to the hospital with this reminder, all returned to the game, with one (Niña Ortiz from the first season) deciding to leave soon after her return from the hospital due to injury.
Another deviation in this franchise is the choice of the merge name, which is done beforehand by the producers. The merged tribe's name normally follows the naming pattern of those of the initial competing tribes. Many other "Survivor" versions usually let members of the new merged tribe make up their new tribal name.
In another deviation, the reunion specials were pre-recorded and were aired in the first Sunday after the final results were announced, which commonly happened in Fridays. One exception was with the reunion special of the fourth season, to be aired in the second Sunday after the live finale. In the American editions, the reunion special is usually aired live immediately after the final results are announced.
Television ratings.
Television ratings are gathered from two major sources, namely from "AGB Nielsen Philippines" and "Kantar Media–TNS". "AGB Nielsen Philippines" covers Mega Manila only, while "Kantar Media–TNS" covers most of the Philippines.

Presseabteilung

The Presseabteilung was a press department created shortly after the German occupation of Norway in April 1940. Through the department, Germans controlled the content of Norwegian newspapers.
Both the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling and the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Enlightenment wanted to control newspapers, but the German occupants used the press department to get the final power of decision. The department consisted of bureaus for general press policy, daily newspapers, illustrated press, culture and economy journalism, news and information.
The work was based on political control of the press, meaning direct interference, closing, firing of editors and journalists, and even arrests.
Oslo papers that were being published got the messages of what to print through the daily press conferences, other papers got classified daily orders by telephone or teleprinter, the latter an innovation brought to Norwegian newspapers by the Germans. Orders went into detail about how the occupant power wanted each piece of news handled, as well as what events were not to be covered at all. NS papers were also established. The largest and best known was "Fritt Folk" ("Free People"), which took over the offices of "Arbeiderbladet" after this Oslo paper was closed down in August 1940.
Several papers that refused to follow guidelines were shut down for longer or shorter periods. Some were made subject to prior restraint rather than the normal censorship after the fact. However, perhaps the most effective sanction was paper rationing.
The department managed to reduce the number of publications, which made its censorship work easier. Towns that had more than one newspaper before the war, were usually left with one.

Slaugenhopia

Slaugenhopia is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl within the family Tupilakosauridae. Fossils have been found from the Early Permian San Angelo Formation in Texas. The type and only species, "S. texensis", was named in 1962. It may be closely related to the dvinosaur "Kourerpeton". "Slaugenhopia" was once classified as a trimerorhachid but is now classified as a tupilakosaurid.
Description and history.
"Slaugenhopia" was found from the San Angelo Formation within the Kahn Quarry of Driver Ranch in Knox County, Texas. Although it was known only from fragments, paleontologist Everett C. Olson reconstructed the entire skull when he named the genus in 1962. He placed the genus in the dvinosaur family Trimerorhachidae and thought that it was intermediate between the dvinosaurs "Trimerorhachis" and "Dvinosaurus" based on the shape of the skull. A mandible that was found earlier in Little Croton Creek was also referred to "Slaugenhopia".
"Slaugenhopia" continued to be classified as a trimerorhachid until 1999 when a new dvinosaur called "Thabanchuia" was named from South Africa. "Thabanchuia" is a member of the family Tupilakosauridae and shares many similarities with "Slaugenhopia". Because of these similarities, "Slaugenhopia" is now considered a tupilakosaurid.
Defining characteristics of "Slaugenhopia" include a notch in the pterygoid bone of the palate called the pterygoid incisure; the wideness of a projection of bone in the palate called the cultriform process, a wide contact between the parasphenoid and basisphenoid bones on the underside of the skull, and uniquely "L"-shaped postparietal bones at the back of the skull. Another Early Permian dvinosaur called "Kourerpeton" is also known from Texas and may be related to "Slaugenhopia". Both dvinosaurs have an enlarged postorbital bone and a small postfrontal bone near the eye sockets. They also have similar vertebrae, with ring-like intercentra and small, crescent-shaped pleurocentra. While the posterior margin of the skull is relatively straight in "Slaugenhopia", the same margin is curved and irregular in "Kourerpeton". "Kourerpeton" also lacks the pterygoid incisure of "Slaugenhopia", which is characteristic of other tupilakosaurids as well. Based on these differences, "Kourerpeton" is probably a basal relative of tupilakosaurids, including "Slaugenhopia".

Stegops is an extinct genus of euskelian temnospondyl from the Late Carboniferous of the eastern United States. Fossils are known from the Pennsylvanian coal deposits of Linton, Ohio. It was once classified in the eryopoid family Zatrachydidae because it and other zatrachydids have spikes extending from the margins of its skull, but it is now classified as a dissorophoid that independently evolved spikes. "Stegops" was first named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1885, with his description of the type species "Stegops divaricata". Cope had also named a species of "Sauropleura" from Linton in 1875, which he called "Sauropleura newberryi". This species was later synonymized with "Stegops divaricata" when the type specimen of "S. newberryi" was prepared and found to be a large specimen of "Stegops". 
Phylogeny.
"Stegops" was included in a phylogenetic analysis in 2006. It was placed in the clade Dissorophoidea, but because it shared features with both of the two main dissorophoid groups, Amphibamidae and Olsoniformes, its exact placement within Dissorophoidea is uncertain.

Purpose-guided education

Purpose-guided education prioritizes intrinsic motivation and helps students to become more engaged in learning experiences through connecting their beliefs and life goals to curricular requirements. Jerry Pattengale first coined the phrase “purpose-guided education”, and began its application at Indiana Wesleyan University in 1997. The graduation rates increased over 20% during the next ten years, and ensuing publications, collaborative research projects, and other scholarly activities gained national attention. The Center for Life Calling and Leadership is perhaps the most visible manifestation of this educational philosophy. Key books include "Why I Teach", "The Purpose-Guided Student", "The Explorer’s Guide", and the basic thesis of "Educating Students Purposefully". Pattengale began questioning aspects of the prevailing approach to student success, as noted in “Student Success or Student Non-Dissatisfaction”. Through surveying over 400 institutions he discovered that over 90% of them based their student success approach on student satisfaction surveys and external issues instead of intrinsic motivation. The original application of this student success approach is found in The Purpose-Guided Student.
Purpose-guided education as a response to limited student success models.
Pattengale contends that “Students are most at-risk when they have no clear understanding of the relevance of college to life after or outside of college. It is important to help alleviate obstacles to educational pursuits, and to address areas of dissatisfaction." However, as noted in "The Purpose-Guided Student", a fundamental objective should be for students to learn about their values and develop a sense of purpose. He argues that this sense of direction will overshadow dissatisfactions and help to sustain them in their challenges. This notion is similar to the maxim of the late Chip Anderson, co-author of Gallup’s "StrengthsQuest", “If the Why is big enough, the How will show up.”
The application of Purpose-Guided Education to the college student success discussion reflects a general theme among recent best-sellers and trends.
A battery of popular books reflects this idea of “beginning with the end in mind,” as Steven Covey champions in his Seven Habits for Highly Successful People. An increasing number of teachers and professors are shoving aside mainstay “student success” curriculum and making room for this Coveyistic genre. Themes throughout the texts of popular writers like John Maxwell, “Dr. Phil” and Parker Palmer imbibe this notion of “alignment,” or “merging” a person’s core with an articulated life purpose. Likewise, Alfie Kohn’s provocative best-seller, "Punished by Rewards", candidly chastises educators for focusing on external issues and incentives instead of intrinsic concerns. Denise Clark Pope’s "Doing School" likewise challenges the current educational steps to academic “success”, a notion also implied in "My Freshman Year".
Purpose in the history of education.
The irony of purpose-guided education, which Pattengale notes, is that it’s actually reclaiming the foundational tenets of education. Socrates’ mantra was that “The unexamined life is not worth living.” This examination, as outlined in "The Purpose-Guided Student", needs to occur against the backdrop of questions about the human condition, similar to those raised in the classics, and in recent thoughtful works dealing with the same. This need for a knowledge base in the purpose-guided model, making the best decisions based on the best available information, in endorsed in many corners of higher education. For example, Robert Maynard Hutchins, closely associated with the Great Books movement, was leery of any social or institutional commitments fueled by zeal without knowledge, and the latter came most notably through a study of the great thinkers through the ages—the “great conversation.” In 1970, he cautioned educators:
It is the absence of anything relevant in the current program of the multiversity that has produced this demand for relevance on the part of the young. When young people are asked, "What are you interested in?" they answer that they are interested in justice, they want justice for the Negro, they want justice for the Third World. If you say, "Well, what is justice?" they haven't any idea …. They are ignorant of the fact that there is a Great Conversation echoing back through history on the subject of justice.
During the Middle Ages the trivium and quadrivium provided the curricular knowledge base to study Theology, “the Queen of the sciences.” Students were preparing to understand more fully their place in this world, and doing so through a deeper understanding of a higher (supernatural) power. In today’s universities, as UCLA’s H.E.R.I. reports on spirituality outline, the majority of students in the first decade of the 21st century place top importance on spirituality, though the shift has changed considerably from the Judeo-Christian version to a more general spirituality. Nonetheless, there is a heightened interest (like the Middle Ages) in understanding one’s place in this world. Numerous studies are trying to find the place once again in education for these metaphysical questions in the curriculum, and while there is a common theme among these “Why” questions, there is a wide range of suggested solutions. Some recent studies want merely to raise the questions, like Anthony Kronman’s "Education’s End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life". While this basic question resonates with purpose-guided education, Kronman’s solutions differ drastically in not providing a format for students to find, articulate and pursue their life purpose after the questions are raised. Recent scholarly works more aligned with purpose-guided education are Christian Smith’s "Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of America’s Teenagers" and "The Schooled Heart: Moral Formation in American Higher Education" by Douglas Henry and Michael Beaty.
Purpose-guided education at Indiana Wesleyan University.
During the 1980s, considerable focus in education was placed on a student’s vocation (instead of career) and aligning life goals with curricular choices instead of following traditional majors without understanding one’s passions. Many schools, like Indiana Wesleyan University, began to focus on “whole-person development,” and became ripe for the research and development of a coherent educational philosophy based on the notion of purpose. The Lilly Endowment, Inc. funded a major Program for the Theological Exploration of Vocation initiative for universities to assist with helping students to understand better their life calling, or vocation. Indiana Wesleyan University was one of the recipients of these grants, and the $5 million grant helped with the intense research and development underpinning purpose-guided education, and especially with the founding of the Center for Life Calling and Leadership, a general education curriculum with “Becoming Worldchangers” as its main course, a humanities-based first-year seminar. The entire education experience at Indiana Wesleyan is based on “World Changing Outcomes,” and involves learning experiences involving both faculty and student development, and includes a Dean of Mentoring and a Mentor Residence Hall.
A longevity study of 1700 students conducted in conjunction with Indiana University’s Research Center validated the value of the purpose-guided curriculum, with positive odds ratios for every cohort studied, and some as high as 12% more likely to succeed than those not in the purpose-guided track. Today, all IWU students go through some key aspect of the purpose-guided programs. Four key purpose-guided initiatives converged to aid student success efforts, and simultaneously to garner selection among the twelve “founding” (original) institutions in the Foundations of Excellence project. These included the mentoring program, the first-year seminar, the Center for Life Calling and Leadership, and most recently, the Mentoring Hall. A dean and associate dean of mentoring were added in 1999 and 2001. The first-year seminar is required of all new students, included transfers. The Center for Life Calling and Leadership, with the aid of the Lilly Endowment, has become a true local, community, and national center. It provides a variety of services, including a curriculum and advising for all pre-declared students.

Surfing in Madeira

Surfing first started in the Portuguese island of Madeira in the 1970s off the villages of Paul do Mar, Jardim do Mar and Punta Pequena. Almost every surfspot is rocky and powerful. No waves seem to break under six feet in the winter months. Madeira did not really come to the attention of foreign surfers until articles in surfing magazines in the mid-1990s. Since 1996, top Portuguese surfers from the mainland compete in the Madeira regional edition of the 'Billabong' Challenge.
In 2001, the World Big Wave Championships were held in Madeira.
One of the more memorable sessions in the history of Madeira surfing occurred on January 25, 1995 at Jardim Do Mar. Portuguese big wave legend Jose Seabra and the Californian artist/rapper/surfer Ithaka (musician) rode absolutely flawless waves up to eight meters on the face by themselves with no other surfers in the water. Photographs of the session by João Valente have appeared in publications around the world including the cover of Surf Portugal Magazine. The conditions which were some of the cleanest and glassiest ever recorded at the classic big wave point break, inspired Ithaka to write the song Seabra Is Mad as well a being nominated for "Song Of The Year" at that year's annual Premios Blitz (the Portuguese equivalent of The Grammy Awards). Ithaka also wrote two other songs inspired by surfing in Madeira, "Eden By The Sea" (also from the album, Stellafly and "Been Four Years" (album Flowers And The Color Of Paint). In 2012, Paul Mandaca, a Brazilian Blues rock performer used a version of Eden By The Sea as the title track of his debut album.
Madeira's surfspots.
Paul do Mar: this surfspot according to surf experts The World Big Wave Championships 2001 was held at Paul do Mar.
Ponta Pequena: another perfect right-hander. Punta Pequena is situated between Jardim do Mar and Paul do Mar
Lugar de Baixo: really hollow and fast.
Sao Vicente: on the north coast is a calmer spot suitable for beginners and intermediate surfers. Here a surf school is based.
Jardim do Mar: the right-hander. Surfing at Jardim is only for the experienced as the waves break large. They start at around two metres and reeling right-handers can reach five metres sweeping along the rocky point.
Jardim do Mar was documented in Jacob Holcomb's film "Lost Jewel of the Atlantic".
The beaches off Funchal, Madeira’s capital, sometimes have fun left-handers.

A Second Face

A Second Face is an independently produced adventure game that was developed by Jospin Le Woltaire in 2008 and released as freeware. It contains elements of fantasy but also science-fiction, however it also unifies them with elements of classic Cyberpunk and overtones of Enlightenment Thought.
Plot.
The story is set on a tide locked planet. The sun-facing side is inhabited by the Strefis, the illuminated ones, while the dark side is populated by the Ugeltz, the people of night. No Ugeltz has ever seen a Strefis however each civilisation remembers the other, in legends. Ugk, the sovereign of the dark realm, has summoned his two sons Rabokk and Torg to send them on a quest that solves the energy problem of the dark side. The dark society depends on a substance called Margin, that is the only energy source and also the main currency of the realm. This substance is running out, because it can't be harvested any longer. Ugk hopes to find a solution for this problem by looking for the legendary realm of light, which could be a new energy source. He offers his position to the son who will succeed in finding the Realm of Light.
History.
"A Second Face" was scripted in Adventure Game Studio, with puzzles invented during the scripting process. Le Woltaire improvised much of this, starting with some backgrounds and characters until he got ideas for the plot and puzzles. Then the main cut-scenes were written to model the basic plot structure, and then the game was developed non-linearly. "Drawing, CAD-modelling, dramaturgy and scripting were mixed together which was a good way for me to make things grow together."
Character design began with a charcoal sketch, then coloured with watercolours. These were scanned and reduced in size to make the characters more detailed. Locations were also sketched, then used as a background reference for 3D-CAD models. These were then digitally edited to match the tone and style of the characters. Characters and locations were hand animated with photoediting software, and limited to six frames to make a compromise between economy and fluid motion.
Le Woltaire was influenced by a city map of ancient Babylonia for the design for City of Ugeltz.
Gameplay.
The plot develops with cinematic cutscenes and gameplay, controlled with a verb coin interface and an inventory-based action system that follows the tradition of classic point and click games. A characteristic text box makes open dialogues with other game figures possible when a single word is entered.
Awards.
"A Second Face" received 15 nominations for the AGS Award 2008. It received a total of three awards named "Best Game 2008", "Best Story 2008" and "Best Backgrounds 2008".

Heistadmoen

Heistadmoen is a Norwegian military encampment in Kongsberg, in the county of Buskerud, Norway. Heistadmoen currently provides able quarters for the Telemark and Buskerud Home Guard District ("Telemark og Buskerud Heimevernsdistrikt"). The camp is large and modern, most of the buildings have been recently refurbished. The camp is also used by other departments for training and shooting.
History.
There were scattered activity on site dating from 1909 when the Telemark Infantry Regiment was based there. The earliest buildings were relocated from the Gråtenmoen area in Skien. The principal function was to provide better protection for the Kongsberg Weapons Factory.
During World War II, Telemark Infantry Regiment capitulated to the invading German Army without a fight on 13 April 1940 due to the threat of German bombing. A number of officers and crew took arms and continued the defense in Telemark. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the German Military built up most of the camp with labor provided by Soviet prisoners of war. After the war ended in 1945, the camp housed German prisoners of war, guarded by U.S. and British soldiers. 
From 1946 to 1952 continued training of infantry battalions of the Tysklandsbrigaden, the Norwegian army's contribution to the Allied occupation force in Germany. In 1994, the new Battalion Telemark created Heistadmoen. The Battalion was moved to Camp Rena during August 2001. It was next occupied by His Majesty the King's Guard 6 Company, which later was also moved to Camp Rena.
Telemark Regiment was laid down on 1 January 2003, and Heistadmoen camp was transferred to the Telemark and Buskerud Home Guard District The facilities are presently available for the use of all districts surrounding the Oslo Fjord. The Telemark Battalion, Krigsskolen Military Academy, National Guard and local police are the principal users. About half the camp is scheduled to be sold, when National Guard does not need buildings.

H (1990 film)

H is a 1990 Canadian film written, directed, and produced by Darrell Wasyk.
Plot summary.
"H" is about two heroin addicts, Michele, Pascale Montpetit and Snake, Martin Neufeld, who struggle to withdraw from the drug. They do it “cold turkey”. Snake nails the apartment door shut: they are determined to come clean. Michele awakens to discover she has been “betrayed” by her lover and is trapped. Barricaded in their apartment, they become each other’s hostage. As the days go by, their resolve ebbs and flows as they dig deeper and deeper into themselves. The hook to heroin addiction is the false sense of immunity to the state at large but as withdrawal starts, this cocooned existence abruptly unravels. Reality sharpens, intensifies, and re-awakens. Sensations flare, as Michele and Snake scrape at the walls, the camera becomes a monitor, never once leaving the apartment. When almost totally withdrawn, Snake discovers a forgotten stash. They are faced with the ultimate question: “Do we really have control over our addictions?”

Farmington Community Library

Farmington Community Library is a public library system in Farmington Hills, Michigan in Greater Detroit. The main library is in Farmington Hills and one of the branches is in Farmington, Michigan.
Locations.
The Main Library is located at 32737 West 12 Mile Road. This is between Farmington and Orchard Lake Roads on the south side of 12 Mile, next to the Farmington Hills Post office.
The Farmington Branch is located at 23500 Liberty Street, one block west of Farmington Road and one block south of Grand River. It is at the corner of Liberty and State Streets, next door to the Farmington City Hall.
Hours of operation for both branches.
Both branches are open every day of the week. They are open Monday through Thursday from 9 am to 9 pm Fridays and Saturdays are open from 10 am to 6 pm, and from 1 pm to 5 pm on Sundays.
History.
The early years.
In March 1913, the Farmington Township board asked some women of the Ladies Literary Society to start a library. Members of the Ladies Literary Society were wives of leading Farmington business and professional men, these ladies would be the official group in charge of the library. The first library was housed in a classroom in the Baptist Church. The women rented the room for $12 a year, started with 800 books and $140 for the first year. The library operated with the money from the Library Association and the money the women were able to raise from fund-raising entertainment and lectures. There were also some funds coming for the Township Board. In 1919, when the war ended, Farmington added onto the Township Hall and a room for the library was created on the north side of the building. Soon the book collection grew to 4,500 volumes, and the need for increased library services and larger facilities became greater. Later, when the U.S. built the new post office in 1958, this same building became the downtown Farmington library. Before long, this building was too small for all the books and a proposal was passed to build a building in the north part of Farmington
The 12 Mile branch.
The plans for construction of the Twelve Mile building were being designed, but the problem of money kept it at a standstill. Applications for federal funds were being rejected and construction cost was beginning to add up. In October, 1968, the plans for the library were suspended. It wasn’t until January 1970, that the decision to continue with the building of the library was decided. However, all the money was used to build the library and there wasn’t any money for books to fill the library. In addition, parts of the basement would go unfinished to bring the cost down. To raise money to add books and furnishings, a gift drive was held. The Farmington Jaycees and the Farmington Rotary Club were major contributors to the gift drive. The Farmington Jaycees decided to finish the children’s room and the Farmington Rotary Club donated money to help finish the Quiet Room. The Farmington Public Library was finished in June 1972. It opened to serve, particularly, the northern part of the community. With three floors, the Library was . The library included reference areas, fiction and non-fiction areas, a lounge, Quiet Room and Children’s Room which consumed the top floors. The lower floor had a meeting room and the Oakland County Sub Regional Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.
The Downtown branch.
The Twelve Mile branch was growing fast and contained over 22,000 books. It was time for the small library to gain another branch. It was decided to build the new branch in downtown Farmington, at the corner of State and Liberty Streets. It took time, but the land needed to build the new branch was obtained in February, 1974. Soon after, an agreement was made to give the libraries standardized names. The Public Library was called the Farmington Hills Branch and the District Library was called the Farmington Branch. In December, 1975, the Farmington branch was ready for business. The lower level became the Children’s Room and the upper level included the fiction and non-fiction areas, and it also contained a quiet room.
Growth.
In January 2003, the Farmington Hills Library went through a renovation, and about was added. A new computer lab and commons area was added and included new computers. Also, wireless internet was added and was now accessible at any study table. The entire lower lever of the building is taken up by the Children Department. The Children’s Department contains a Smart Start center. The center has fully interactive reading readiness activities.
Governance.
The Farmington Community Library is governed by a Board of Trustees. The Library’s Board is composed of eight members, each being nominated either by Farmington or Farmington Hills (four members each). Board meetings are held the second Thursday of each month at the main library in Farmington Hills and the meetings are open to the public. The Board of Trustees establishes, maintains and operates the libraries, can appoint or remove a librarian, and can supervise and control the Library’s property.

Chameria Battalion

The Chameria battalion () was a battalion of the National Anti-Fascist Liberation Army of Albania during the Second World War. It was formed from the organized resistance groups of Cham Albanians on 15 June 1943 and was renamed as the IV Chameria Group () on October 1943, which ceased to exist after the Liberation of Albania. It included at the time of its creation more than 500 armed troops, the vast majority of whom were Albanians from the Greek part of Chameria region and the rest from the Albanian part, and about 40 members of the Greek minority in Albania.
Background.
On April 7, 1939 Italian troops invaded Albania. The operation was led by General Alfredo Guzzoni. Despite some stubborn resistance by some patriots, especially at Durrës, the Italians made short work of the Albanians. Durrës was captured on April 7, Tirana the following day, Shkodër and Gjirokastër on April 9, and almost the entire country by April 10. 
Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son Leka fled to Greece and eventually to London. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to depose Zog and unite the nation with Italy "in personal union" by offering the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III.
Formation and renaming.
In 15 June 1943, members of unorganized resistance groups in Southern Albania and Northwestern Greece decided to create the Chameria battalion, during the meeting of the "Regional Committee of the National Anti-fascist Liberation Army" in Konispol. The decision was adopted on June 30, 1943, when three resistance groups were united. These groups included the Tahsini group based in Konispol, the Father Stathi Melani group based in Filiates, and the Alush Taka group based in Paramithia. Each group numbered about 170-180 members, from which only 75 were not Cham Albanians, of whom 35 were from Delvinë and 40 were members of the Greek minority in Albania.
This battalion was the first big partisan organization in the Gjirokastër County (which at that time included Gjirokastër, Sarandë and Delvinë districts) and head as leader Haki Rushit Shehu from Konispol and as group leaders, Taho Mehmet Sejko from Filiates, Lefter Miço Talo from Ampelia (), Ali Demi from Filiates and as political commissar, Qazim Kondi from Polyneri ().
On October 10, 1943, the battalion was renamed as "IV Chameria Group ", which had more than 2 thousand troops, about half of them were Cham Albanians, and the rest Albanians and Greeks from southern Albania.
Contribution to the war.
Chameria battalion was one of the main contributors in resistance to Italian and German forces in southern Albania. Four major battles are recorded to this battalion. At the end of 1943, a group of Cham Albanians, led by Ali Demi, attacked a German garrison, in Vlora, Albania, killing 39 German troops and losing 12 members of the battalion, including Ali Demi himself.
The second major operation was after September 8, 1943, when Italy capitulated, "Chameria battalion" entered Delvinë and disarmed the local regiment of the Italian Army, on September 12, 1943.
The Italian source (G. Bonomi - Sacrificio italiano in terra albanese - La Prora; T. Scanagatta - Gli ultimi trenta giorini della divisione "Perugia" - Hoepli; and others) reports that on September 12, 1943 in Delvine there was only the 2nd battalion of 129 Infantry Regiment "Perugia". Not the whole regiment. And the battalion left Delvine, full armed, to "Argirocastro" called back from the Commander of the Division Gen. Chiminello. The same for the 3rd battalion in Giorgiokat. 
The third operation was in the region between Konispol and Sagiada, on the next day, when they tried to disarm the local regiment of the Italian army in Saranda. They were forced to back in Sagiada by the Italian army, but in a counter-offensive managed to seize the regiment, disarm them and take all army equipments of the regiment in Saranda.
The same Italian source reports that In Saranda on September 13, 1943 there was no Regiment but 3.500 Italian soldier from many different corps. All of them left to Corfù 09/13/1943. There was no fight with the Chameria Battalion 
The fourth and final major operation occurred in the end October 1, 1943, when Chameria battalion managed to trap a squadre of German troops in the road between Filiates and Konispol and killed 12 Germans, taking their equipments.
After being transformed into the "IV Chameria Group", its members took part in operations of the VI, VII, VIII and XII brigades of the Albanian National Liberation Army not only in Albania, but also in Kosovo, Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia.
Aftermath.
IV "Ali Demi" battalion.
In 1944, Greek People's Liberation Army asked Cham Albanians living in Greece to create a battalion and to enlist in its ranks. Having a good relation with the Albanian Army, ELAS's and NAFLA's officers managed to persuade Chams to create armed forces under the ELAS army.
In May 1944, a group of local Cham Albanians, under the lead of "Chameria battalion" soldiers created the battalion named after Ali Demi, in the village Milea (), which was included in the 15th regiment of Greek People's Liberation Army. At the time of its creation, it comprised 460 partisans, consisting of both Cham Albanians and Greeks. "Ali Demi" battalion was the second largest of ELAS in the area of Epirus.
Being formed at the end of the war, the battalion had no considerable contribution in the liberation of Greece. More than 60 Chams were killed during a battle with German forces in Igoumenitsa. Other Cham Albanians were enlisted in VI, VII, IX and XI brigade of Greek People's Liberation Army, and fought in different mixed battalions of ELAS.
After the war.
In an attempt to establish an ethnically pure border region, the Chams were evicted from northern Greece by guerrilla forces under the command of General Napoleon Zervas acting under the instructions of allied officers.
Muslim Cham Albanians that fled in Albania, were organised as refugees by the communist-led Albanian government. They formed a congress in 1946, adopted a memorandum, accused Greece for their persecution, and asked the international community to react in order to return to their homeland and to acquire reparations.
After their expulsion, the these vets of ELAS, and the Cham Albanians from Greece, who took part in Chameria battalion formed in Albania the "National Anti-Fascist Cham Committee", which was disbanded in 1947, when Cham Albanians lost their refugee status.

Jason Foundation

The Jason Foundation is a US organization that provides curriculum material to schools, parents and other teens about how teen suicide can be preventable. The Jason Foundation wants to send out awareness of the "silent epidemic" that is teen suicide. The Jason Foundation was started in 1997 after the suicide of Jason Flatt, a 16 year-old from Nashville, Tennessee.
Jason's Story.
Jason's father, Clark Flatt, wrote a letter to anyone interested in learning about how to help youth suicide. In the letter Jason's father reveals that Jason was a normal 16 year old boy, who enjoyed hanging with friends, playing sports and was a B-average student. Sadly, on July 16, 1997 Jason became the next statistic in youth suicide. After Jason's death, his father began researching about youth suicide, with the intention of discovering effective methods of suicide prevention. The Jason Foundation was created to help stop this silent epidemic.
Students' Help.
The Jason Foundation has created a system for the youth of today to help prevent another person from taking their life. One part of this is the use of the "LIFE" model, which is an anagram for: 
<br>• Listen to your friends when they need to talk about problems or thoughts of suicide.
<br>• Insist that they be honest with you.
<br>• Feelings—share them with each other.
<br>• Extend a helping hand and go with them to get a responsible adult involved to help. 
This method was created as a way to approach an endangered teen in a non-threatening way about the teen's actions or thoughts. The Jason Foundation stresses that if someone knows about their friend thinking about suicide to never keep it to oneself, communicate the problem to a parent, a school guidance counselor, or a teacher about what was heard.
Parents' Help.
The Jason Foundation believes that there are effective ways for a parent to help a child not become another victim of youth suicide. The Jason Foundation promotes the idea of educating oneself about the problem and the signs of concern, and the tools that can be used for suicide prevention. JF encourages parents to approach school systems to incorporate JF ideals and methods into school curricula, and to provide teachers with the tools to help with this issue. JF stresses that watching and listening to children is a huge in helping awareness of potential problems that may eventually lead to self-harm. JF believes that parents who talk to their child and allow their child to express his or her feelings are better equipped to help with the development of coping mechanisms. Also, the parent with a strong concern about their child can always seek professional help.
A Promise For Tomorrow.
A school-based curriculum unit of study suitable for grades 7 through 12. It can be taught as a stand- alone program or as an objective within another discipline like health and wellness. The students are given information about the problem of youth suicide and strategies to recognize and help a friend who may be at risk. The underlying lesson is that a responsible adult must be told of the concerns so that appropriate help can be found. The program contains easy to follow lesson plans, a discussion DVD and activities for students.
The Promise Program.
At the end of your education about what the Jason Foundation is trying to accomplish the learner is presented with a little card. This card is a promise, on the card there is a little paragraph stating "I promise to be here for my friends. I will watch for any behavior that concerns me and I will TALK, LISTEN and RESPOND using the LIFE model. I won’t be silent." and then the student signs their name. The card also has the LIFE method on how to help and warning signs. The warning signs or signs of concern which are:
<br>• Depression
<br>• Abrupt changes in behavior
<br>• Mood swings
<br>• Crying spells
<br>• Recent grief or losses
<br>• Changes in school performance
<br>• Giving away treasured belongings
<br>• Suicidal threats
<br>• Hopelessness
<br>All the things on this card are put on there to help out a teen in need. When given this card the participant must take this seriously or else the education was for nothing, the pledge not only keeps yourself alive but it has the ability to help save another life.
Teen Suicide Facts.
People do not hear much about youth suicide that is why the Jason Foundation calls it a silent epidemic because it does not appear on peoples radar as a problem. In the USA teen suicide is the second leading cause of death for college aged youth and for kids ranging from the ages of 15-19. Each week the US loses approximately 100+ people to youth suicide, also according to the NMHA, four out of five people who attempt suicide have given clear warnings, which is why the Jason Foundation has brought awareness to those warnings by giving teens and adults the Promise Program Card.

Tarjeta de Identificación Consular Guatemalteca (TICG) is Guatemala's consular identification card also known as the Guatemalan CID card. Guatemala began issuing this card in the United States in August 2002 following the lead of the Mexican government's foreign consular agents in the U.S. who began lobbying U.S. states, municipalities and financial institutions to accept the Mexican CID card in March 2002.
Unlike Mexico's CID card application process, Guatemala requires a valid Guatemalan passport which is checked against Guatemala’s

Think Detroit PAL

Think Detroit PAL is a nonprofit organization that organizes youth football, basketball, baseball, track, soccer and many other recreational sport leagues around the city of Detroit, MI. Each sport league lasts for 8–12 weeks for kids ages 7–14. Think Detroit PAL allows inner city youth to participate in summer, winter, spring or fall activities and programs to help kids build character and get kids active and social at a young age.
History.
Think Detroit PAL was formed on March 1, 2006 with the merging of the Think Detroit|Think Detroit Inc. organization and the Detroit Police Athletic League (PAL). The purpose of this merger between the two leading youth organizations in the city of Detroit was designed to accomplish the goal of "serving more kids through better programs."
Registration.
Registration for one of Think Detroit's PAL Athletic programs includes a copy of your child's original birth certificate and a small fee. Participants can register through an independent team, such as a school or local club, or individually.
Programming.
Think Detroit PAL runs recreation sports and school leagues for over twelve different sports. In the football program, Think Detroit PAL hosts an annual league championship at Ford Field, where over 6,000 spectators and supporters come to watch games and participate in the festivities. In addition, Think Detroit PAL hosts a cheerleading competition, various camps, clinics and academies.
Volunteer.
Because Think Detroit PAL is a nonprofit organization, it cannot afford to hire coaches for all the teams it supports. Therefore the continuation of the Think Detroit PAL organization relies on the nearly 1,500 volunteers that dedicate their time to coach or participate in Think Detroit PAL's programs. Each volunteer coach must participate in the IMPACT coaches training program. Volunteer coaches must also learn all the rules and guidelines of the sport they are volunteering to coach and be able to pass a criminal background check to ensure a safe environment around the children.
Events.
Think Detroit Pal hosts a variety of [special events[ throughout the year. Think Detroit PAL is one of the charities that benefits from the North American International Auto Show charity preview at Cobo Hall. In addition, Paul W. Smith hosts the Annual Paul W. Smith Golf Classic to benefit Think Detroit PAL and the organization participates in the Detroit Free Press/Flagstar Bank Marathon.

Sarchinger Weiher is a lake in Landkreis Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. At an elevation of 330 metres, its surface area is 0.28 square kilometers.
The lake is a flooded gravel-pit. In the surrounding area, there are several small lakes created by gravel quarrying.
The north-western, north-eastern, and south-western banks were filled up with sand to create a beach and make the water shallow for children. On these banks, there are also kiosks, lavatories and official fireplaces for barbecues. The further lakesides are planted with trees and shrubs to provide sufficient shade.
In the middle of the southern half of the lake, there is a small island which over the last years and decades became a breeding zone for rare birds, e.g. the black-crowned Night Heron. The island is still freely accessible.

Eurasian Adam

Eurasian Adam (also known as Australian/Eurasian Adam or Out of Africa Adam) or Y Chromosome Noah is a name given to the man who was the common "male-line" (patrilineal) ancestor of all men with the single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation on the Y chromosome known as "M168". The qualifier "Eurasian" is quite inaccurate as his descendants include most Africans. In other words he is the most recent common patrilineal ancestor of all men in Haplogroup CT, the world's largest haplogroup including most Africans and everyone else, which is defined by having a common ancestor who had M168. 
According to current research, he probably lived in Africa and his descendants and his male line descendants are the only prehistoric one to survive outside of Africa into modern times. They dominate the male population of Africa as well.
This term was developed in imitation of the concept of the more well-known "Y-chromosomal Adam" indicating his important status as a second major point in human patrilineal history. However it is important to keep in mind that:

Embedded hypervisor

Software virtualization has been a major topic in the enterprise space for quite some time, but has become an important technology for embedded systems only starting around 2010. The use of virtualization and its implementation in the form of a hypervisor in embedded systems are very different from enterprise applications.
An effective implementation of an embedded hypervisor must deal with a number of issues specific to such applications. These issues include the highly integrated nature of embedded systems, the requirement for isolated functional blocks within the system to communicate rapidly, the need for real-time/deterministic performance, the resource-constrained target environment and the wide range of security and reliability requirements.
Definitions.
Hypervisor.
A hypervisor provides a software virtualization environment in which other software, including operating systems, can run with the appearance of full access to the underlying system hardware, but in fact such access is under the complete control of the hypervisor. The software running in such a hypervisor managed environment is said to be executing within a virtual machine (VM). Multiple VMs may be managed simultaneously by a hypervisor. Hypervisors are generally classed as type 1 or type 2, depending on whether the hypervisor is running in supervisor mode or privileged mode on “bare metal” (type 1) or is itself hosted by an operating system (type 2).
Embedded hypervisor.
An embedded hypervisor is a type 1 hypervisor that supports the requirements of embedded systems development and is designed into the embedded device from the outset, rather than loaded subsequent to device deployment. The requirements for a hypervisor architecture suitable for embedded applications are quite distinct from hypervisors aimed at enterprise applications, which have a fundamentally different set of requirements. See references & for a more detailed discussion. These requirements are summarized below.
Implementation.
To meet the requirements typical of most embedded applications, an embedded hypervisor must provide multiple VMs, each of which is essentially indistinguishable from the underlying hardware to which the virtualised software needs access. This ensures that the embedded code that runs on the real machine will run on the virtual machine and vice versa. The size and efficiency of the implementation is also an issue for an embedded hypervisor, as it needs to maintain as closely as possible the native speed, real-time response and determinism and power efficiency of the underlying hardware platform.
Implementations for embedded systems applications have been most commonly based on the use of a microkernel or small separation kernel, with virtualization built-in as an integral capability. This was introduced with PikeOS in 2005. Examples of these approaches have been produced by companies such as Open Kernel Labs (microkernel) and LynuxWorks (small separation kernel). VirtualLogix appears to take the position that an approach based on a dedicated Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) would be even smaller and more efficient. This issue is the subject of some ongoing debate; see references, &. However, the main point at issue is the same on all sides of the discussion – the speed and size of the implementation (for a given level of functionality) are of major importance. For example: " . . . hypervisors for embedded use must be real-time capable, as well as resource-miserly." 
The small code size generated by these approaches is of such great importance since system resources such as memory are typically highly constrained in embedded applications, compared to enterprise systems. Thus embedded hypervisors usually have a memory footprint from several tens to several hundred kilobytes, depending on the efficiency of the implementation and the level of functionality provided. An implementation requiring several megabytes of memory (or more) is generally not acceptable.
The small size of the hypervisor also provides the basis for a minimal trusted computing base (TCB). This TCB is the only part of the entire system code which is allowed to run in privileged mode, thus enhancing the inherent security of the system. The amount of trusted user-mode code can be kept to an absolute minimum with this approach. This is in contrast to type 2 hypervisors, which are commonly designed to be used with a guest OS underneath any other software.
This approach also means that the TCB can be made highly secure & reliable. Standard software-engineering techniques, such as code inspections and systematic testing, can be used to reduce the number of bugs in such a small code base to a tiny fraction of the defects that must be expected for a hypervisor and guest OS combination that may be 100,000–300,000 lines in total.
One of the most important functions required in an embedded hypervisor is a secure message-passing mechanism, which is needed to support real-time communication between processes. In the embedded environment, a system will typically have a number of closely coupled tasks, some of which may require secure isolation from each other. In a virtualized environment, the embedded hypervisor will support and enforce this isolation between multiple VMs. These VMs will therefore require access to a mechanism that provides low-latency communication between the tasks.
An inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism can be used to provide these functions, as well as invoking all system services, and implemented in a manner which ensures that the desired level of VM isolation is maintained. Also, due to its significant impact on system performance, such an IPC mechanism should be highly optimised for minimal latency.
Lastly, an embedded hypervisor needs to be in complete control of system resources, including memory accesses, to ensure that software cannot break out of the VM. So an embedded hypervisor requires the target CPU to provide memory management support (typically using an MMU). However, unlike the enterprise space, a number of processors aimed at embedded applications do not provide such support, so selection of a suitable target architecture able to support a Type 1 hypervisor may be an issue.
Use cases.
Some of the most common use cases for an embedded hypervisor are:
1. OS independence
Designers of embedded systems may have many hardware drivers and system services which are specific to a target platform. If support for more than one OS is required on the platform, either concurrently or consecutively using a common hardware design, an embedded hypervisor can greatly simplify the task. Such drivers and system services can be implemented just once for the virtualized environment; these services are then available to any hosted OS. This level of abstraction also allows the embedded developer to implement or change a driver or service in either hardware or software at any point, without this being apparent to the hosted OS.
2. Support for multiple operating systems on a single processor
Typically this is used to run a real-time operating system (RTOS) for low-level real-time functionality (such as the communication stack) while at the same time running a general purpose OS, (GPOS) like Linux or Windows, to support user applications, such as a web browser or calendar. The objective might be to upgrade an existing design without the added complexity of a second processor, or simply to minimize the bill of materials (BoM).
3. System security
An embedded hypervisor is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem defined by the developer, so that a compromised subsystem cannot interfere with other subsystems. For example, an encryption subsystem needs to be strongly shielded from attack to prevent leaking the information the encryption is supposed to protect. As the embedded hypervisor can encapsulate a subsystem in a VM, it can then enforce the required security policies for communication to and from that subsystem.
4. System reliability
The encapsulation of a subsystem components into a VM ensures that failure of any subsystem cannot impact other subsystems. This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from a subsystem in one VM to a subsystem in another VM, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection. This can be particularly important for embedded device drivers, as this is where the highest density of fault conditions is seen to occur, and is thus the most common cause of OS failure and system instability. It also allows the encapsulation of operating systems that were not necessarily built to the reliability standards demanded of the new system design.
5. Dynamic update of system software
Subsystem software or applications can be securely updated and tested for integrity, by downloading to a secure VM before “going live” in an executing system. Even if this process then fails, the system can revert to its former state by restarting the original software subsystem/application, without halting system operation.
6. Legacy code re-use
Virtualization allows legacy embedded code to be used with the OS environment it has been developed and validated with, while freeing the developer to use a different OS environment in a separate VM for new services and applications. Legacy embedded code, written for a particular system configuration may assume exclusive control of all system resources of memory, I/O and processor. This code base can be re-used unchanged on alternative system configurations of I/O and memory through the use of a VM to present a resource map and functionality that is consistent with the original system configuration, effectively de-coupling the legacy code from the specifics of a new or modified hardware design.
Where access to the operating system source code is available, paravirtualization is commonly used to virtualize the OS’s on processors without hardware virtualization support, and thus the applications supported by the OS can also run unmodified and without re-compilation in new hardware platform designs.
Even without source access, legacy binary code can be executed in systems running on processors with hardware virtualization support such as the AMD-V, Intel VT technologies and the latest ARM processors with virtualization support. The legacy binary code could run completely unmodified in a VM with all resource mapping handled by the embedded hypervisor, assuming the system hardware provides equivalent functionality.
7. IP protection
Valuable proprietary IP may need protection from theft or misuse when an embedded platform is being shipped for further development work by (for example) an OEM customer. An embedded hypervisor makes it possible to restrict access by other system software components to a specific part of the system containing IP that needs to be protected.
8. Software license segregation
Software IP operating under one licensing scheme can be separated from other software IP operating under a different scheme. For example, the embedded hypervisor can provide an isolated execution environment for proprietary software sharing the processor with open source software subject to the GPL.
9. Migration of applications from uni-core to multi-core systems
As new processors utilise multi-core architectures to increase performance, the embedded hypervisor can manage the underlying architecture and present a uni-processor environment to legacy applications and operating systems while efficiently using the new multiprocessor system design. In this way a change in hardware environment does not require a change to the existing software.

Though Prescott made her acting debut in a single episode of the BBC soap opera "Doctors" ("Dare, Double Dare, Truth") along with sister Kathryn in 2008, it wasn't until the following year when she appeared as Katie Fitch in the third series of "Skins" that she made a breakthrough in acting. She and her sister, who plays Katie's identical twin Emily Fitch on the show, began filming the third series of "Skins" in July 2008 and went on to reprise their roles for the fourth series of the show as well.
Since the show's format is limited to only two series per "generation" of characters, neither Prescott nor her co-stars joined the fifth series as a major part of the cast.
In relation to her work with "Skins", Prescott has appeared as a correspondent at open auditions for the show, the official "Skins Parties", and at Channel 4's T4 On The Beach with the cast on a number of occasions.
Following her completion with the "Skins" series Prescott expressed worry for her future in acting, however she has brushed it off as a reasonably common fear and has expressed strong interest in starring in the American television show Desperate Housewives, of which she is a fan. On her sister's official blog Kathryn revealed that the siblings may take a gap year to possibly volunteer with an animal sanctuary in Malaysia or Florida.
Prescott was included in AfterEllen's "Hot 100 List" for 2010 ranking at #68 for sexiest women.
In 2011 Prescott once again made it into the AfterEllen's "Hot 100 List" ranking at #87 for sexiest women.
Megan was recently cast as Jade Podfer on the British drama show called Holby City and in a horror movie .

Villages of Portland

The Isle of Portland, Dorset, contains eight settlements, the largest being Fortuneswell in Underhill and Easton in Tophill. Castletown and Chiswell are the other villages in Underhill, and Weston, Southwell, Wakeham and the Grove occupy Tophill.
Villages.
Southwell.
Southwell (pronounced ) is a small coastal village in Tophill on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, between Portland Bill and the village of Easton. Like many of the other villages on Portland, Southwell has commercial industry (Southwell Business Park). The village has one Primary School, Southwell County Primary School. 
Easton.
Easton is the second largest of eight villages on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The village is situated on the top of the island or Tophill, in the English Channel, and was where the Easton Massacre took place. The village has a small square with many shops and shopping arcade, a Secondary school, four churches, a small park, and other amenities. Easton is also the location of Portland Young Offenders Institution. At the south end of Easton is Portland Museum.
Along with Fortuneswell, Easton is the main hub of the Isle of Portland's activities.
Fortuneswell.
Fortuneswell (pronounced ) is the largest of eight villages on the Isle of Portland, just off the coast of Dorset in the English Channel. The village lies on steeply sloping land on the northern edge of the island (Underhill), where Chesil Beach, the tombolo which connects the island to the mainland, joins the island.
The village has a main shopping street with several shops.
The nearby villages of Chiswell and Castletown almost merge into Fortuneswell, as they share the limited space on the northern slopes of the island. However, Fortuneswell occupies the steepest land far above sea level, whereas Castletown and Chiswell occupy flat land close to sea level, next to Portland Harbour and Chesil Beach respectively.
Weston.
Weston is a village in Tophill on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is on the outskirts of the main village Easton, and near also to the village of Southwell. Weston contains a Roman Villa - one of the few archaeological sites on the Isle of Portland, which is opposite the Royal Manor Arts College.
Castletown.
Castletown is a small village in Underhill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. It has a sandy beach and has a working port, Portland Port. The village itself is on the shores of Portland Harbour, and includes Portland Castle and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy. The village has a long naval history, and the Royal Navy had a base in the harbour until 1999. Now Portland Port is commercial, whilst still servicing and berthing Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships.
Chiswell.
Chiswell (pronounced or ; rarely Chesilton) is a small fishing village at the southern end of Chesil Beach, in Underhill. The small bay at Chiswell is called Chesil Cove.
The village itself is indistinguishable from Fortuneswell, the largest village on the island, as the two settlements are very close. However this distinction can be made: Chiswell occupies flat land close to sea level, whereas Fortuneswell's streets wind up and down the steep hills.
Over the centuries Chiswell has battled with the sea and has been regularly flooded during rough winter storms which can over top the high Chesil Beach which protects the village. Flood defences installed during the 1980s have alleviated the problems and there has not been widescale flooding since. 
Wakeham.
Wakeham is a small village near the village of Easton, in Tophill on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England.
The Grove.
The Grove is a small village near Easton containing HMP Portland, the Young Offenders Institution.

Expert Committee on Questions of Population and Racial Policy

The Expert Committee on Questions of Population and Racial Policy () was a Nazi Germany committee formed on 2 June 1933 that planned Nazi racial policy. On July 14, 1933, the committee's recommendations were made law as the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring, or the "Sterilization Law".
The committee was organized by Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, and brought together many important Nazi figures on racial theory, including Ernst Rudin, Alfred Ploetz, Arthur Gutt, Heinrich Himmler, Fritz Thyssen, Fritz Lenz, Friedrich Burgdorfer, Walther Darre, Hans F. K. Günther, Charlotte von Hadeln, Bodo Spiethoff, Paul Schultze-Naumburg, Gerhard Wagner, and Baldur von Schirach.
Preceding Weimar Republic committee.
The Nazi's expert committee replaced the old "Reichsausschuss fur Bevolkerungsfragen", established by Frick's predecessor, Carl Severing. Only one member of the new committee—Friedrich Burgdorfer—was also on the old committee.
Findings.
At the first meeting, Frick gave a speech calling for a new German population policy. He argued the declining birthrate would weaken the quantity and quality of the race. Germany at that time had been facing an increasingly older population, and Jews were immigrating in large numbers. Frick argued this would lead to "degenerate" offspring. He also warned the number of "genetically diseased" were growing because of a lack of a government racial policy. He estimated—conservatively, in his opinion—the number of Germans with genetic defects to be at 500,000. "Some experts," he said, "consider the true figure to be as high as 20 percent of the German population."
Sterilization law.
Because of the findings of the committee, the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring was passed. The law allowed the compulsory sterilization of any citizen who in the opinion of a "Genetic Health Court" suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders. Under this law, Nazi doctors sterilized nearly 400,000 people.

Death (protopunk band)

Death is a garage rock and protopunk band formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1971 by brothers Bobby (bass, vocals), David (guitar), and Dannis (drums) Hackney. The black trio started out as a funk band but switched to rock after seeing a concert by The Who. Seeing Alice Cooper play was also an inspiration. Music critic Peter Margasak retrospectively wrote that David "pushed the group in a hard-rock direction that presaged punk, and while this certainly didn’t help them find a following in the mid-70s, today it makes them look like visionaries." The band broke up by 1977 but reformed in 2009 when the Drag City label released their 70s demos for the first time. 
History.
In 1964, the three young Hackney brothers (David, Bobby and Dannis) were sat down by their father to witness The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The following day, David found a discarded guitar in an alley and set about learning to play. Brothers Bobby and Dannis soon followed suit and they began playing music together.
The brothers practiced and recorded early demos in a room in the family home and performed their earliest gigs from their garage. Originally calling themselves Rock Fire Funk Express, guitarist David convinced his brothers to change the name of the band to Death. "His concept was spinning death from the negative to the positive. It was a hard sell," Bobby Hackney recalled in 2010.
In 1975 at Detroit’s United Sound Studios with engineer Jim Vitti, they recorded seven songs written by David and Bobby. According to the Hackney family, Columbia Records president Clive Davis funded the recording sessions, but implored the band to change its name to something more commercially palatable than Death. When the Hackneys refused, Davis ceased his support. The band only recorded seven songs instead of the planned dozen. The following year they self-released (on their label Tryangle) a single taken from the sessions: "Politicians in My Eyes" b/w "Keep on Knocking," in a run of just 500 copies.
The Hackney brothers ended the band in 1977. The brothers then moved to Burlington, Vermont and released two albums of gospel rock as The 4th Movement in the early 1980s. David moved back to Detroit in 1982, and died of lung cancer in 2000. Bobby and Dannis still reside in Vermont and lead the reggae band Lambsbread.
In 2008 the sons of Bobby Hackney (Julian, Urian, and Bobby Jr.) started a band called Rough Francis, covering the songs of Death after discovering the old recordings in their parents' attic. In 2009, Drag City Records released all seven Death songs from their 1975 United Sound sessions on CD and LP under the title "...For the Whole World to See". In September 2009, a reformed Death played three shows with original members Bobby and Dannis Hackney, with Lambsbread guitarist Bobbie Duncan taking the place of the late David Hackney.
In 2010, their song "Freakin' Out" was used in an episode of the television program "How I Met Your Mother" entitled "False Positive" (Season 6, Episode 12). During a 2010 performance at the Boomslang Festival in Lexington, Kentucky the band announced that Drag City would release a new album with demos and rough cuts that predate the 1975 sessions. The album "Spiritual • Mental • Physical" was released in January 2011. In 2011, their song "You're A Prisoner" was used in the film "Kill the Irishman". An independent documentary film about the band titled "A Band Called Death", directed by Jeff Howlett and Mark Covino, was released in 2012.

Rhônexpress

Rhônexpress is an express train line which links downtown Lyon, France with its airport, Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport, and the TGV train station located there. The passage from the airport to the city's business center at Part-Dieu Villette (Lyon-Part-Dieu railway station) by way of Vaulx-en-Velin – La Soie (transfer to Metro Line A) and Meyzieu ZI lasts roughly half an hour. It opened on 9 August 2010. The Conseil général of the Rhône franchised the operation of this line for 30 years to Rhônexpress, a consortium including VINCI (28.2%), Veolia Transport (28.2%), Vossloh Infrastructure Service (4.2%), Cegelec Centre Est (2.8%) and the Caisse des dépôts et consignations.
The route is served by 6 trams, which were built by the Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail. The route has a length of and it takes 29 minutes to go from Part-Dieu to the airport; service is every 15 minutes at peak times. Tickets cost €15 one way and €26 round trip, and are cheaper when purchased online. The project included building of new track, while remainder of the route runs along the tracks of the existing T3 tram line, which is built with passing tracks to allow express service. The service is independently run and is not a part of the TCL system, although it appears on TCL maps.
Stations.
Rhônexpress uses the infrastructures of the line T3 built by Sytral (in French, Syndicat mixte des Transports pour le Rhône et l'Agglomération Lyonnaise) up through Meyzieu (a hub for commuters with a large surface parking lot available). From there, all track used was built specifically for the Rhônexpress all the way to Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. There are only four stops:
Rolling stock.
The rolling stock was chosen after a tender, taking into account the technical criteria (speed up to 100 km/h), robustness, security and compatibility with the common use of infrastructure by the T3 line, economic (capacity adapted to the traffic and prospects for their development) as well as comfort and aesthetics.
These six trainset Tango 12 were provided by the Swiss manufacturer Stadler and built at the factory in Berlin Weiden.
The interior and exterior design of the trains for Stadler Tango was created by the agency RCP Design Global (Tours), who had already built the tramways of Le Mans, Angers and Paris.

Hoxie House (ca. 1675) in Sandwich, Massachusetts is one of the oldest houses on Cape Cod and one the oldest surviving houses in Massachusetts.
The saltbox house was built in the mid-seventeenth century and occupied around 1675 by Rev. John Smith, his wife Susanna and their 13 children. Smith served as pastor of the Separatist First Church of Sandwich church from 1673 until 1689. He also served as a representative to the legislature and recommended tolerance of the Quakers, a religious minority in the area. 
In the mid-nineteenth century, Abraham Hoxie, a whaling captain, purchased the property. The town of Sandwich acquired the home in the 1950s and restored the building.
