Le testament de la tante Caroline

Le testament de la tante Caroline ("Aunt Caroline's Will") is an opéra bouffe or operetta by composer Albert Roussel and librettist Nino (pseudonym of Michel Veber). The original production was in the Czech language (prepared by Julie Reisserová) and in three acts, but the work was later revised into a one act operetta in the French language. The operetta tells the story of a family who is caught in a difficult set of circumstances surrounding the contents of a will and the dispersal of a vast fortune. The work premiered in Olomouc on 14 November 1936.
History.
"Le testament de la tante Caroline" was composed by Roussel in 1932-1933. The comic operetta was a departure from his earlier works which were all of a serious nature. Roussel acknowledged that the works of composers Arthur Honegger and Jacques Ibert had influenced him to pursue writing a comic opera as they had been successful both critically and financially. He described the operetta as "a sort of opérette-bouffe whose characters are almost entirely grotesque and who should be played without any fear of exaggerating their effect".
The opera premiered at the opera house in Olomouc on 14 November 1936 (as "Testament Tetý Karoliny") to somewhat cool reviews. Although Roussel intended for the work to be "clear, pleasant and accessible", the critics felt he had difficulty in "adapting himself to simplicity". In reaction to this criticism, Roussel significantly revised the operetta by cutting it from three acts to just one act. This reduced version was used for the opera's French premiere at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 11 March 1937. The revised version was sung in French, while the original 3-act version was performed in Czech. A production in German was mounted in Prague in 1937.
Synopsis.
The operetta begins in a Paris apartment where the future heirs of Aunt Caroline’s vast wealth are waiting for the reading of her will. In attendance are Caroline’s two nieces, sisters Christine and Naomi, and their husbands Jobard and Ferdinand. The four dream about the inheritance and what they can do with all of that money. The will, however, does not meet with the expectations of the two couples. The money is left not to Caroline's nieces, but their first-born sons. Further, the will stipulates that the couples must produce a son within the next year, or the money will be given away to the Salvation Army. Unfortunately, both Jobard and Ferdinand are infertile and so the nieces decide to get pregnant via a fortune teller and the family's chauffeur, respectively. However, in the tradition of the French operetta, the plot ends with an unexpected ironic twist. A third niece, who is an old maid and an apparent model of respectability and virtue, reveals that she is in fact the mother of the family's chauffer, Noël. As her illegitimate son, Noël collects the money to the chagrin of the others.

Khan Sulayman Pasha

Khan Sulayman Pasha () is a large khan in the Old City of Damascus. Located in the walled city of Damascus on the eastern side of the Street Called Straight, facing Suq al-Khayyatin and Al-Buzuriyah Souq. It was built and named after Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, the governor of Damascus, in 1732-36. The khan is popularly known as "Khan al-Hamasina" because traders from Homs used to rent its shops and warehouses.
Architecture.
The "khan" is rectangular in plan and is composed of two levels of rooms overlooking a courtyard that was originally roofed with twin domes. The courtyard is twice as long as it is wide. It is framed by six arches, two along the long sides and one on the short sides, that span the two floors raised on six pillars. These arches used to support the domes, which sat on pendentives. 
Shops occupy the lower floor of the khan. They open onto the courtyard with arched doorways and windows, and with round windows located between two archways. The upper floor is composed of individual rooms accessed from a gallery that wraps the courtyard on four sides. The khan is built with alternating courses of limestone and basalt. 
The "khan" lost its intense activity towards the end of the nineteenth century and has since been used as a storage space and as a traditional nut-roastery factory.

Atlanta Pride, also colloquially (and formerly) called the Atlanta Gay Pride Festival, is a week-long annual lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) pride parade held in Atlanta, Georgia (United States). Established in 1971, it is one of the oldest pride parades in the United States. According to the Atlanta Pride Committee as of 2007, attendance was averaging around 200,000. Until 2008, it was held in Piedmont Park in Midtown Atlanta. In 2008 large events were banned from Piedmont Park due to drought conditions, so Atlanta Pride was held in the Civic Center. In 2009 it returned to Piedmont Park, but kept the October date due to more favorable autumn weather and the difficulty in performing adequate fundraising in only nine months.
Held in October to coincide with "National Coming Out Day," The Atlanta Pride festival is preceded by a variety of events that begin in June to celebrate the Stonewall riots. In addition, Atlanta's Out on Film gay film festival offers a weeklong selection of LGBT films by, for and about the LGBT community. While a separate event, Out on Film runs in conjunction with Atlanta Pride.

<doc id="21456938" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21456938" title="Glee (TV series)">
Glee (TV series)

Glee is an American musical comedy-drama television series that airs on the Fox network in the United States. It focuses on the fictitious William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions, which competes on the show choir competition circuit while its disparate members deal with relationships, sexuality, social issues, and learning to become an effective team. The initial twelve-member cast included club director and Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and eight club members played by Dianna Agron, Chris Colfer, Kevin McHale, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber Riley, Mark Salling, and Jenna Ushkowitz. In subsequent seasons, the main cast has expanded to fourteen and fifteen members.
The series was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, the last of whom first conceived of "Glee" as a film. The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk initially served as the show's main directors. The pilot episode was broadcast on May 19, 2009, and the first season aired from September 9, 2009, to June 8, 2010. Subsequent seasons aired in September through May; the fifth season premiered on September 26, 2013, and a sixth season has already been commissioned. "Glee" features on-screen performance-based musical numbers that are selected by Murphy, who aims to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, and produced by Adam Anders and Peer Åström. Songs covered in the show are released through the iTunes Store during the week of broadcast, and a series of "Glee" albums have been released by Columbia Records. The music of "Glee" has been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an iPad application, and karaoke games for the Wii. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting; a concert film based on the 2011 tour, "", was produced by Murphy and Fox and directed by Kevin Tancharoen.
During its first season, "Glee" received generally favorable reviews from critics, with Metacritic's weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on eighteen critical reviews. The season was nominated for nineteen Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, six Satellite Awards and fifty-seven other awards, with wins including the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, and Emmy awards for Jane Lynch, guest-star Neil Patrick Harris and Murphy's direction of the pilot episode. In 2011, the show once again won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, and Jane Lynch and Chris Colfer won Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and Gwyneth Paltrow won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The show was also chosen by Fox to fill the coveted time slot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011.
On October 17, 2013, in the wake of the death of Cory Monteith three months earlier, and a week after his tribute episode "The Quarterback" was aired, Murphy announced that the sixth season would be the final season of the series.
Production.
Conception.
Ian Brennan conceived "Glee" based on his own experience as a member of the Prospect High School show choir in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He initially envisioned "Glee" as a film, rather than a television series, and wrote the first draft in August 2005 with the aid of "Screenwriting for Dummies". He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years. Mike Novick, a television producer and a friend of Brennan's from Los Angeles, was a member of the same gym as Ryan Murphy, and gave him a copy of Brennan's script. Murphy had been in a show choir in college, and felt he could relate to the script. Murphy and his "Nip/Tuck" colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that "Glee" be produced as a television show. The script was entirely rewritten, and was picked up by Fox within fifteen hours of being received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the network's success with "American Idol". "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein", he said. Murphy and Falchuk became the show's executive producers and showrunners, Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a producer. Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing "all the episodes".
"Glee" is set at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself grew up in Indiana, and recalled childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is filmed at Paramount Studios and Helen Bernstein High School in Hollywood. Murphy has said that he has never seen a "High School Musical" film, to which "Glee" has been compared, and that his interest lay in creating a "postmodern musical," rather than "doing a show where people burst into song," drawing more heavily on the format of "Chicago". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why "Idol" worked. It's pure escapism," he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.
Writing.
The three creators—Murphy, Falchuk, and Brennan—plan the stories together. For the first two seasons, they were the only writers, and after taking joint credit for the pilot episode and the episode that opened the fall 2009 season, they began rotating taking a single auctorial credit, based in large part on the person "who’s taken the lead in story breaking or who wrote a draft". Brennan noted that the writing process is "fast and loose, with the emphasis on fast", and quotes Murphy as having said, in terms of their roles in episode creation, "I'm sort of the brain. Brad's sort of the heart. Ian's sort of the funny bone", which Brennan says "is true in a lot of ways". Some of the characters are written more by one writer than by the others. Brennan writes most of Sue's material, and Falchuk frequently writes the scenes between Kurt and Burt Hummel, though Murphy contributes a great deal to Kurt.
Starting with season three, a writing staff of six was hired: Ali Adler, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Marti Noxon, Michael Hitchcock, Matt Hodgson and Ross Maxwell. The season's fourth episode, "Pot o' Gold", was written by Adler, the first not credited to the show's three creators.
Adler and Noxon did not return for the show's fourth season and instead "House" writers Russel Friend and Garrett Lerner, and Stacy Traub were hired.
Music and choreography.
The series features numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and has said that he strives to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy ("Glee" creator) and told him a couple of things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.
Murphy was surprised at the ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including Bryan Adams, Guns N' Roses and Coldplay; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing "Glee" the rights to their catalog. Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of "Glee" had never requested permission from him and urged them to "pick up the phone". Composer and musician Billy Joel offered many of his songs for use on the show, and other artists have offered use of their songs for free. A series of "Glee" soundtrack albums have been released through Columbia Records. Songs featured on the show are available for digital download through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later. "Glee" music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom have begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, "Loser Like Me" and "Get It Right", on the March 15, 2011 episode.
"Glee" is choreographed by Zach Woodlee and features four to eight production numbers per episode. Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P. J. Bloom, and music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom rearranges it for the "Glee" cast. Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins six to eight weeks before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins. Each episode costs at least $3 million to produce, and can take up to ten days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography. In late 2010, Bloom reported the process has been even shorter; "as quick as a few weeks". For the second season, the creators were offered listens of upcoming songs in advance by publishers and record labels, with production occurring even before song rights are cleared.
Promotion.
Prior to the second episode's premiere, "Glee"'s cast went on tour at several Hot Topic stores across the nation. The cast sang the U.S. national anthem at the third game of the 2009 World Series. Macy's invited them to perform at the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but host broadcaster NBC declined because "Glee" aired on a rival network. Murphy commented on the cast's exclusion: "I completely understand NBC's position, and look forward to seeing a Jay Leno float."
The show's success sent the cast on a concert tour, Glee Live! In Concert! after the first season's wrapup. They visited Phoenix, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. The cast also recorded a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas", which was released as a single in late 2009 but didn't appear in the show until "A Very Glee Christmas" on December 10, 2010. Morrison, Lynch, Michele, Monteith, and Colfer reprised their roles as Will, Sue, Rachel, Finn, and Kurt respectively for a cameo appearance in an episode of "The Cleveland Show" that aired January 16, 2011. Michele, Monteith, and Riley appeared as campers in the twenty-second season premiere of "The Simpsons".
Lynch, Colfer, Monteith, and Riley appeared at the 2010 MTV VMAs on September 12, 2010. When Agron, Michele, and Monteith posed for a set of risqué photos for the November 2010 edition of "GQ" magazine, Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized the show; PTC president Tim Winter commented that "Glee" has many young fans, and that "by authorizing this kind of near-pornographic display, the creators of the program have established their intentions on the show’s direction. And it isn't good for families."
The promotional posters for the first season have the show's stars using their right hands to make an "L" to fill in the "L" of the word "Glee". The second season's promotional posters have the stars throwing slushies at the camera in pairs. The third season's promotional posters have the stars getting dodgeballs thrown at them by Sue Sylvester. While the cast concert tour, Glee Live! In Concert!, began on May 15, 2010, and presented concerts in four cities in the US that month, the second edition, with an almost-entirely new set list, toured for four weeks in the US and Canada from May 21 through June 18, 2011, and followed with twelve days in England and Ireland, from June 22 through July 3, 2011. The cast also performed on the seventh season of "The X Factor" on December 5, 2010.
Cast and characters.
In casting "Glee", Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in "Hairspray" and "The Light in the Piazza"; Lea Michele, who starred in "Spring Awakening"; and Jenna Ushkowitz, who had been in the Broadway revival of "The King and I".
Actors lacking theatrical experience needed to demonstrate, during their auditions, that they could also sing and dance. Chris Colfer had no previous professional experience, but Murphy wrote in the character Kurt Hummel for him. Jayma Mays auditioned with the song "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from "The Rocky Horror Show", while Cory Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" of REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling". Kevin McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously been part of the group Not Like Them. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R&B. Even the musical theatre stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." Jane Lynch was originally supposed to have a recurring role, but was made a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through. The cast is contracted for a potential three "Glee" films, with their contract stating that "actor hereby grants Fox three exclusive, irrevocable options to engage actor in up to, respectively, three feature-length motion pictures." Murphy said in December 2010 that he wasn't interested in doing a "Glee" movie "as a story", and added, "I might do it as a live concert thing." "", filmed during the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour, was released on August 12, 2011.
"Glee" has featured as many as fifteen main roles with star billing, after starting with twelve. Morrison plays Will Schuester, McKinley High's Spanish teacher, who becomes glee-club director and hopes to restore it to its former glory. Lynch plays Sue Sylvester, head coach of the "Cheerios" cheerleading squad, and the Glee Club's nemesis. Mays appears as Emma Pillsbury, the school's mysophobic guidance counselor who has feelings for Will, and Jessalyn Gilsig plays Terri Schuester, Will's wife whom he eventually divorces after five years of marriage and the discovery that she has faked being pregnant instead of revealing she had suffered a false pregnancy. Michele plays Rachel Berry, talented star of the glee club who is often bullied by the Cheerios and football players, but grows closer to them as the show progresses. Rachel has an on-and-off relationship with Finn Hudson starting in season one; they become engaged in season three. Monteith played Finn, star quarterback of the school's football team who risks alienation by his friends after joining the glee club. Also in the club are Amber Riley as Mercedes Jones, a fashion-conscious diva who initially resents having to sing back-up; Colfer as Kurt Hummel, a fashionable gay male countertenor; McHale as Artie Abrams, a guitar player and paraplegic; and Ushkowitz as Tina Cohen-Chang, an Asian American student with a fake speech impediment. Dianna Agron plays Quinn Fabray, Finn's cheerleader girlfriend, who later joins the glee club to keep an eye on him. Mark Salling plays Noah "Puck" Puckerman, a good friend of Finn's on the football team who at first disapproves of Finn joining the glee club, but later joins it himself. Naya Rivera and Heather Morris, who portray Cheerios and glee club vocalists Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce respectively, were originally recurring actors, but were promoted to series regulars in the second season. Mike O'Malley, who plays Kurt's father Burt Hummel, also became a series regular on season two. Gilsig and O'Malley no longer appear on the list of starring actors at the beginning of the third season, though O'Malley will be appearing as a recurring guest star in at least six episodes during the season. Two actors were promoted to series regulars as of the third season: Harry Shum, Jr. as football player and glee club member Mike Chang and Darren Criss as former Dalton Academy Warbler and new club member Blaine Anderson, both of whom started as recurring actors, Shum in the first season and Criss in the second. For the fourth season, Chord Overstreet, who started as a recurring actor in the second season, playing glee club member Sam Evans, was promoted to the main cast, while Agron and Mays were credited as recurring guest stars.
Many of the original characters graduated from McKinley High at the end of the third season. Murphy said, "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch will remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—will likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [tweet,] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." He then continued: "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes."
On June 28, 2013, the media reported that Morris, Riley, Salling, and Shum would be changing from starring status to guest starring roles for the fifth season, and on the following day that Jacob Artist, Melissa Benoist, Blake Jenner, Alex Newell and Becca Tobin, who play Jake Puckerman, Marley Rose, Ryder Lynn, Wade "Unique" Adams and Kitty Wilde, respectively, were all being promoted to the show's main cast.
On July 13, 2013, Monteith was found dead in his room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia. An autopsy completed on July 15 indicated that he died of alcohol and heroin overdose. On July 20, 2013, Ryan Murphy said in various media outlets that Cory would have a tribute in season five's third episode, which would deal with the death of Monteith's character, Finn.
On July 30, 2013, Mays confirmed that she will depart the show after the fifth season to work on other projects, but stated that she would be open to returning as a guest star in the future.
On July 7, 2014, it was confirmed that Rivera would be demoted to a recurring status for the sixth and final season, by her request.
Broadcast.
The first season of "Glee" consists of twenty-two episodes. The pilot episode was originally broadcast on May 19, 2009. The series returned on September 9, 2009, airing an additional twelve episodes on Wednesdays in the 9:00 pm timeslot until December 9, 2009, for a total of thirteen episodes. On September 21, 2009, nine more episodes were ordered for the first season by Fox, and the first of these episodes was broadcast on April 13, 2010. These episodes aired on Tuesday evenings at 9:00 pm. On January 11, 2010, it was announced that Fox had commissioned a second season of the show. The second season began production in June 2010. Season two began on September 21, 2010, airing in the 8:00 pm time slot on Tuesdays, and consists of twenty-two episodes. The show was chosen by Fox to fill the coveted timeslot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011, and the network originally planned to move the show to the 9:00 pm time slot on Wednesdays following the post–Super Bowl broadcast. However, Fox later revised its schedule, leaving "Glee" on Tuesdays in order to concentrate on building up its weaker Wednesday and Thursday line-ups. A third season was ordered by Fox on May 23, 2010, before the end of the first season. The early renewal of the show allowed the production team to cut costs and to plan ahead when writing scripts. The third season broadcasts remained in the show's Tuesday 8:00 pm time slot, and began airing on September 20, 2011. The show's fourth season changed both date and time of broadcast: it moved to Thursdays in the 9:00 pm time slot, and aired after that evening's 8:00 pm music competition "results" shows—"The X Factor" in the fall and "American Idol" in midseason. The show was renewed for both a fifth and sixth season at the same time, on April 19, 2013.
"Glee" has been syndicated for broadcast in many countries worldwide, including Australia, where cast members visited to promote the show prior to its September 2009 debut on Network Ten.

It is broadcast in South Africa, where Fox beams the episodes directly to the M-Net broadcast center in Johannesburg rather than delivering the tapes. In addition, it airs in the United Kingdom, where E4 broadcast the first two seasons, showing episodes months after they were first aired in the US. Sky1 broadcast the series starting with the third season, airing episodes two days after their US broadcast. Asian countries that broadcast "Glee" include Bangladesh, the Philippines, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Reception.
Critical reception.
"Glee" received a Metacritic score of 77 out of 100 in its first season, based on reviews by eighteen critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". It was praised by critics in several round-up reviews of 2009 in television. James Poniewozik of "Time" ranked it the eighth best television show of the year, commenting: "when "Glee" works—which is often—it is transcendent, tear-jerking and thrilling like nothing else on TV." "Entertainment Weekly" Ken Tucker ranked it ninth, calling it "Hands down the year's most novel show also its least likely success", Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that while ordinarily "Glee" premise would have been "a recipe for disaster", the show has "such quirky charm and bravado that it is impossible not to get swept up". Reviews for subsequent seasons on Metacritic, reflecting their initial episodes, were not quite as good—the second season's score was 76 out of 100 from eleven reviews, and the fourth season received a score of 73 out of 100 from six reviews.
Nancy Gibbs of "Time" magazine wrote that she had heard the series described as "anti-Christian" by a youth minister, and commented: It is easy to see his point, if you look at the specifics. [...] The students lie, they cheat, they steal, they lust, they lace the bake-sale cupcakes with pot in order to give the student body a severe case of the munchies. Nearly all the Ten Commandments get violated at one point or another, while the audience is invited to laugh at people's pain and folly and humiliation. ... It insults kids to suggest that simply watching Characters Behaving Badly onscreen means they'll take that as permission to do the same themselves. [...] And it's set in high school, meaning it's about a journey not just to college and career but to identity and conviction, the price of popularity, the compromises we must make between what we want and what we need."
"Variety" Brian Lowry was critical of the show's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues and deeming the adult cast "over-the-top buffoons", with the exception of Mays' Emma, who he felt offered "modest redemption". Though he praised Colfer and Michele's performances, Lowry wrote that the show's talent was squandered by its "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone", deeming the series a "one-hit wonder". Following the show's mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while "Glee" "remains a frustrating mess at times", its "vibrant musical numbers and talented cast have consistently kept it on TiVo must list" conceding that "even with its flaws, TV would be poorer without "Glee"."
As "Glee" initial success pulled in a large audience, John Doyle of "The Globe and Mail" wrote that the early shows "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids had a kind of square naïveté." Doyle notes that the early success took "Glee" away from its original characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. "The gaiety is gone from "Glee". You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago". Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe similarly wrote that "It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once made it so addictive".
Music.
The show's musical performances have been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million copies of "Glee" cast single releases purchased digitally, and over eleven million albums purchased worldwide through October 2011. In 2009, the "Glee" cast had twenty-five singles chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100, the most by any artist since The Beatles had thirty-one songs in the chart in 1964; in 2010, it placed eighty singles on the "Billboard" Hot 100, far outstripping the previous record. In February 2011, "Glee" surpassed Elvis Presley as the act with the most songs placed on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, though fewer than one-fourth of them have charted for more than one week. The cast performance of "Don't Stop Believin' was certified gold on October 13, 2009, achieving over 500,000 digital sales, and on March 16, 2011, received platinum certification for having sales of over a million. The series' cover version had a positive effect on sales of Rihanna's "Take a Bow", which increased by 189 percent after the song was covered in the "Glee" episode "Showmance".
However, there has also been critical condemnation of the cast performances. Jon Dolan of "Rolling Stone" commented that Matthew Morrison "couldn't rap his way out of a 98° rehearsal", and Allmusic's Andrew Leahey wrote that Cory Monteith and Dianna Agron "can't sing nearly as well as their co-stars". E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its "overproduced soundtrack" and complained that many songs rely too heavily on the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune: "For every too-brief moment of Lea Michele sounding raw—and lovely—on a "What a Girl Wants", or Monteith singing a perfectly credible REO Speedwagon in the shower, there's Michele and Monteith sounding like 1990s-era Cher on "No Air", or Monteith sounding like the Monteith XRZ-200 on the out-of-the-shower version of "Can't Fight This Feeling".
During the second season, Rob Sheffield for "Rolling Stone" noted the Britney Spears and "Rocky Horror" tribute episodes as examples when he lauded "Glee" and its choice of music. He praised Murphy for his selection and resurrection of "forgotten" pop songs and compared the show's uniqueness to "MTV in its prime" as the embodiment of popular culture.
Some artists, including Slash, Kings of Leon and Foo Fighters, have declined to have their songs used on the show. Murphy has been publicly critical of these refusals, which has led to exchanges in the press between him and a number of artists. A slated cover of Sir Mix-a-Lot's "Baby Got Back" in the season four episode "Sadie Hawkins" has been criticized as allegedly copying a rendition of the song by Jonathan Coulton without his permission. Side-by-Side comparison shows the waveforms appear remarkably similar. Other artists have come forward with allegations of plagiarism in light of this development.
It was reported that musician Prince was unimpressed about Glee covering his hit "Kiss", and that he had not authorised this.
Fandom.
Fans of "Glee" are commonly referred to as "gleeks", a portmanteau of "glee" and "geek". Fox ran a "Biggest GLEEK" competition, measuring fans' "Glee"-related activity on social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace, and found that the growth of the fanbase outpaced the network's science-fiction shows. The cast's Hot Topic tour was titled "The Gleek Tour". "Glee" is one of the most tweeted-about TV shows. In 2011, it was the top trending US TV show. On IMDb, "Glee" is the seventh highest ranking TV series of the period 2002–2012. Fans have recreated many of its musical numbers in tribute to the show, sharing them on YouTube. Based on this trend, show producers included instrumental versions of some songs on the show's soundtracks.
Similarly, "Glee" fans have created portmanteaus of character couples, such as "Finchel" for Finn and Rachel, "Klaine" for Kurt and Blaine, and "Brittana" for Brittany and Santana. This fact has been referenced in various second season episodes, notably "Furt", which is itself a coinage for the new stepbrothers Finn and Kurt, and "Rumours".

Viewing figures rose to 11.07 million viewers for the season finale, giving "Glee" the highest finale rating for a new show in the 2009–10 television season. Only the first twenty episodes of the first season were accounted for when calculating the season average due to the final two episodes airing outside the traditional sweeps period.

In January 2010, it was announced that open auditions would be held for three new roles to be introduced in "Glee" second season. They were open to amateurs and professionals aged sixteen to twenty-six, and were intended to be the subject of a multi-part television special, set to air in the lead-in to the second season premiere in fall 2010, with the new cast members revealed in the first episode. Murphy commented: "Anybody and everybody now has a chance to be on a show about talented underdogs. We want to be the first interactive musical comedy on television." On June 22, 2010, Josef Adalian of "New York" magazine revealed that the reality show would not go ahead, due to Murphy's desire to concentrate on the main series, and fear that the distraction of the reality show may damage "Glee". Adalian reported that the production team would still choose several winners from the entrants and invite them to appear on "Glee" for at least one episode. In June 2010, it was announced that Oxygen would host a reality series set to air in June 2011, featuring performers competing for a spot on Glee.

On June 7, 2010, UK broadcaster Channel 4 aired "" on its E4 station. The documentary explored the American show choir phenomenon which inspired "Glee". Narrated by Nick Grimshaw, it went behind the scenes with real-life glee clubs and detailed celebrity show choir alumni including Lance Bass, Ashton Kutcher, Blake Lively and Anne Hathaway. It was selected as recommended viewing by "The Guardian", with the comment: "it's a fascinating look at the real-life New Directions, and it's equally as crackers as its TV champion." The newspaper's Lucy Mangan reviewed the documentary positively, writing: "It will, one way or another, fill your heart to bursting", and commenting that: ""Glee", it turns out, is not a gloriously ridiculous, highly polished piece of escapism. It is cinéma vérité." It was watched by 411,000 viewers, a 2.3% audience share.
In summer 2010, Channel 5 in the United Kingdom aired "Don't Stop Believing", a reality talent show inspired by "Glee" success.

Solo singers were also sought to join a group to represent the United Kingdom on the American glee club circuit. Five's controller Richard Woolfe stated: "There's an explosion in musical performance groups and "Don't Stop Believing" will tap into that exciting groundswell." The show was hosted by Emma Bunton, who told "The Belfast Telegraph" that she is a "huge fan" of "Glee". The show's judges were former "EastEnders" actress Tamsin Outhwaite, Blue member Duncan James, singer Anastacia and "High School Musical" choreographer Charles "Chucky" Klapow.

Francisco de Berganza

Fray Francisco de Berganza y Arce (10 April 1663 – 29 April 1738), better known as Padre Berganza, was a Spanish Benedictine monk and medievalist. Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo called him "la lumbrera intelectual de su siglo" ("the brightest intellect of his age"). 
He was the son of Francisco de Berganza and Jacinta de Arce, baptised in the parish church of Santibánez de Zarzaguda, though his family was from Gumiel de Izán. On 5 February 1682 he took the Benedictine habit at the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña, making his profession a short while later, on 21 March. He was shortly thereafter sent to study at San Vicente de Salamanca, where he spent twelve years before returning to Cardeña. There he became chief preacher and finally abbot, from 1721 to 1725. He died suddenly during suppertime at the convent of San Martín de Madrid. 
As a historian he was innovative and modern, rejecting traditional methods of historical inquiry, he turned to the direct study of the documents. His "Antigüedades de España" brought to light many documents, including many from the archives of Cardeña, that had not until then been publicised. It was published in two volumes, the second at Madrid from 1719–21. He uncovered many forgeries that exposed traditional narrative of the origins of Castile and the unity of Spain. Posthumously at Madrid in 1729 was published his "Ferreras convencido", a revision of the history of Ferreras.

Li Qi (military governor)

Li Qi (李錡) (741 – December 3, 807) was a military governor ("Jiedushi") of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, governing Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). In 807, he rebelled against the authority of Emperor Xianzong, but he was quickly defeated and captured by his own subordinates who turned against him, and he was delivered to the capital Chang'an and executed.
Background and service during Emperor Dezong's reign.
Li Qi was born in 741, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His father Li Ruoyou (李若幽), who was later renamed Li Guozhen (李國貞) by Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, was a member of Tang Dynasty's imperial Li clan — his fifth-generation ancestor was one of the contributors to Tang's establishment, Li Shentong (李神通) the Prince of Huai'an, a cousin of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu. During the reign of Emperor Suzong, Li Guozhen was killed by soldier mutineers in the service of the imperial cause and, because of Li Guozhen's contributions, Emperor Suzong's grandson Emperor Dezong, during middle of the "Zhenyuan" era (785-805), had Li Qi serve as the prefect of Hu Prefecture (湖州, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang) and then Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang).
As Li Qi often sent bribes to Emperor Dezong's close associate Li Qiyun (李齊運), in 799, Li Qi, who was then referred to as the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) was further made the prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and governor (觀察使, "Guanchashi") of Zhexi Circuit (浙西, headquartered at Run Prefecture) as well as the director of salt and iron monopolies (鹽鐵使, "Yantieshi"). He further made tributes to Emperor Dezong, drawing Emperor Dezong's favor. As he knew he had Emperor Dezong's favor, he became arrogant and unrestrained in his behavior, and it was said that he seized the salaries of his subordinates and often killed them without good cause. A civilian from Zhexi Circuit, Cui Shanzhen (崔善貞) submitted a petition to Emperor Dezong pointing out the harm that several of Emperor Dezong's policies were having on the people, and in the petition, he accused Li Qi of crimes. Emperor Dezong read the petition and was displeased. He ordered Cui arrested and delivered to Li Qi. Li Qi, in anticipation of Cui's arrival, dug a large hole in the ground, and when Cui arrived, he had Cui thrown into the hole and buried alive.
It was also around this time that Li Qi, trying to ensure his future safety, began to expand his forces. In particular, he selected the strongest archers and made them into a special Wanqiang Corps (挽強), while selected the ethnically Xiongnu or Xi soldiers and made them into a special Fanluo Corps (蕃落). The Wanqiang and Fanluo soldiers were paid 10 times as much as the regular soldiers, in order to garner their loyalty. They referred to him as their adopted father. It was also said that he often forced women from good households to become his concubines (one of those concubines, a Lady Zheng, would later enter the imperial palace and become the mother of Emperor Xuānzong.) Li Qi's staff members Lu Tan (盧坦) and Li Yue (李約), after being unable to persuade him to curb his actions, left his staff.
During Emperor Shunzong's reign.
Emperor Dezong died in 805, and his son Emperor Shunzong took the throne. Soon after Emperor Shunzong became emperor, he made Li Qi the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (i.e., Zhexi) but stripped him of the position of director of salt and iron monopolies, transferring the position to the chancellor Du You. It was said that while Li Qi thus lost the lucrative economic responsibilities, he gained a military command, and therefore did not resist the orders.
During Emperor Xianzong's reign.
Later in 805, Emperor Shunzong, who was seriously ill, yielded the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong. By this point, it was commonly thought that Li Qi would eventually rebel — so much so that when the official Du Jian (杜兼) was made the prefect of Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) late in 805, Du declined on the basis that he believed that Li Qi would soon rebel and that Du and his clan would be killed in the rebellion. Emperor Xianzong accepted Du's rationale and kept him at the imperial government.
After the rebellious general Liu Pi, who occupied Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) was defeated and killed by imperial forces in 806, however, many regional governors became apprehensive and offered to pay homage to the new emperor. Li Qi also did so in 807, and Emperor Xianzong agreed and sent a eunuch to Zhenhai's capital Jingkou to comfort Li Qi and his soldiers. However, although Li Qi made his assistant Wang Dan (王儋) acting military governor in his anticipated absence, he did not actually intend to depart for the capital Chang'an, so he delayed his departure several times, despite urgings by the imperial eunuch and Wang for him to depart. Li Qi instead submitted a petition claiming illness and asking to delay the journey to 808. When Emperor Xianzong requested the chancellors' comments, Wu Yuanheng pointed out that Emperor Xianzong needed to assert imperial authority — and that Li Qi's offer to pay homage to him and then refusal to do so was a challenge to imperial authority. Emperor Xianzong agreed, and issued an edict summoning Li Qi to Chang'an. Li Qi, unable to think of anything else, decided to rebel. Meanwhile, Li Qi was also angered by how Wang, after being made acting military governor, was making decisions that changed his policies, and thus incited the soldiers to kill Wang. On a day when Wang and the imperial eunuch were meeting him, he had some several soldiers proclaim, "Who is this Wang Dan who dares to give orders?" The soldiers rushed into the headquarters and killed Wang, eating his body. When the officer Zhao Qi (趙琦) tried to comfort and stop the soldiers, the soldiers also killed Zhao and ate his body. When the soldiers dragged the imperial eunuch out, Li Qi pretended to be surprised and personally went to rescue the eunuch.
Meanwhile, on November 8, 807, Emperor Xianzong, issued an edict recalling Li Qi to serve as "Zuo Pushe" (左僕射), one of the heads of the executive bureaus of government (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng") and naming the official Li Yuansu (李元素) as his replacement as military governor of Zhenghai. The next day, Li Qi submitted a report claiming that a mutiny had led to Wang's and Zhao's deaths, apparently seeking to be allowed to remain. Meanwhile, though, he also secretly ordered five military officers that he had stationed at five prefectures under his jurisdiction — Su, Chang, Hu, Hang, and Mu (睦州, in modern Hangzhou) — to kill the prefects and seize control, and further ordered his officer Yu Boliang (庾伯良) to prepare Shitou in anticipation of an imperial attack. However, Yan Fang (顏防) the prefect of Chang Prefecture had already heard of this and killed the officer Li Qi sent to monitor him, Li Shen (李深). Yan sent communiques to the other four prefectures ordering the other four prefects to attack the rebels, and those prefects were also able to defeat Li Qi's officers, except for Li Su (李素) the prefect of Su Prefecture, who was captured by Li Qi's officer Yao Zhi'an (姚志安).
On November 14, Emperor Xianzong issued an edict stripping Li Qi of his titles and of his imperial clan membership. He ordered seven circuits around Li Qi's to converge on Zhenhai. Meanwhile, Li Qi was intending to attack and capture Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) due to Xuan's prosperity, and he gave 3,000 soldiers to his officers Zhang Ziliang (張子良), Li Fengxian (李奉仙), and Tian Chaoqing (田少卿) to have them attack Xuan Prefecture. However, the three of them knew that Li Qi could not stand long, and they conspired with Li Qi's nephew Pei Xingli (裴行立) to act against Li Qi. The night after they departed Run Prefecture, they informed their soldiers their intentions, and the soldiers followed them back to Run Prefecture and attacked the city. When Li Qi heard that Zhang had turned against him, he initially angrily ordered resistance, but when he heard that Pei joined Zhang as well, he became saddened and found the situation hopeless; instead, he escaped and tried to hide. When one of his officers, Li Jun (李均), tried to resist with 300 Wanqiang soldiers, Pei defeated and killed Li Jun. Li Qi was captured and delivered to Chang'an. The Wanqiang and Fanluo soldiers, hearing this, all committed suicide.
The chancellors initially discussed executing Li Qi's cousins. The official Jiang Ai (蔣乂) pointed out that Li Qi's cousins were all Li Shentong's descendants and should not suffer this kind of fate. When the chancellors discussed alternatively that Li Qi's brothers be executed, Jiang further pointed out how Li Guozhen had died in imperial service, and that his descendants should be allowed to survive. The chancellors agreed and only exiled Li Qi's cousins.
On December 3, Li Qi arrived at Chang'an. Emperor Xianzong personally questioned him as to why he rebelled. Li Qi responded, "I did not want to rebel. It was Zhang Ziliang and others like him who told me to rebel." Emperor Xianzong responded, "You are the commander. If Zhang and the others were plotting treason, why did you not execute them and then come to see me?" Li Qi was unable to respond, and he was executed with his son Li Shihui (李師回) by being cut in half at the waist. His assets were confiscated by the imperial treasury; in substitution, because Li Qi's wealth came from the people, the people of Zhenhai were exempted from taxation that year.

Sauerbruch Hutton

Sauerbruch Hutton is an architecture practice based in Berlin, Germany. It was founded by Matthias Sauerbruch and Louisa Hutton in 1989. The firm creates functional, sensual and conscientious architecture with individuality and personality. The practice is noted for its synthesis of colour in the design process, and for the use of fluid curvilinear forms. The firm’s architecture is also known for its technical innovation and environmental sustainability, particularly double-skin facades on tall buildings, with the GSW Headquarters in Berlin (1991) and KfW Westarkade (2010) in Frankfurt as examples.
The practice is led by Matthias Sauerbruch, Louisa Hutton and Juan Lucas Young.
Beginnings.
Matthias Sauerbruch (b. 1955) studied architecture at Berlin’s "Hochschule der Künste" (now Berlin University of the Arts) and at the Architectural Association in London, graduating in 1984. He has worked at Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture in London, leading the House at Checkpoint Charlie project. He has maintained an involvement in teaching throughout his professional career, having held professorships at the University of Virginia, the State Academy of Art and Design in Stuttgart and Berlin Technical University. In 2005 he was appointed Kenzo Tange Visiting Design Critic at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He is a grandson of the surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch.
Louisa Hutton (b. 1957) completed her undergraduate degree at Bristol University and later graduated from the Architectural Association. She worked at the offices of Alison and Peter Smithson and has taught at the AA, the University of Virginia and Harvard University.
Early work.
The firm’s first offices were located in London, where both founders were engaged in teaching roles. Many of their first commissions were in relatively confined urban areas, such as L House in London. A typical Victorian terrace, this was the practice’s first essay in applied colour. The architects used colour to visually expand the cramped spaces.
The firm completed competition entries for Paternoster Square in London (1989), Tokyo International Forum (1989) and the Junction Building in Birmingham (1989). These schemes all offered socio-culturally and environmentally sustainable alternatives to the conventions in architecture and planning at the time.
The GSW Headquarters.
The GSW Headquarters is situated 250 meters from Checkpoint Charlie. It was the first tall building to rise in Berlin after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The winning competition proposal by Sauerbruch Hutton was a critique of the "Critical reconstruction" established by Hans Stimmann, Berlin's building director from 1991 to 2006.
The GSW Headquarters has double-skinned facades. The system of blinds on the west facade plays an important role in controlling solar gains and reduces the use of artificial heating and cooling. Polychromy was a key feature of the blinds.
Recent works.
Their work for GSW gained Sauerbruch Hutton considerable renown and established their worldwide reputation. In the works that followed, they continued to develop their use of colour as a building material on projects throughout Europe. The Federal Environmental Agency in Dessau (2005), among their largest projects to date, uses coloured panels which pick out colours from surrounding buildings to help root the massive scheme. A serpentine plan fosters a personal, corporeal perception of the building as one walks along its length – an uncommonly sensuous gesture for an office building.
An inventive spirit pervades all of the practice’s work, resulting in a portfolio of prototypical and thoroughly original architecture. Printed glass emerged as one of the practice’s main research interests, with their Pharmacological Research Laboratories (2002) and Jessop West (2008) testing new potential for the material. In 2008, with the Brandhorst Museum, Sauerbruch Hutton also began exploring the applications of glazed ceramic as a construction material.
In the last decade the practice has worked outside of Germany on projects in England, Finland, France, Italy and the Netherlands. The studio’s contribution to Maciachini, a large urban renewal scheme in Milan, opened in May 2010.
Recognition.
For their work, Louisa Hutton and Matthias Sauerbruch were awarded the Erich Schelling Prize for Architecture (1998). The firm also won the Fritz Schumacher Prize in 2003. They have received other awards for individual buildings.

Sir Henry Baker, 2nd Baronet

Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Loraine Baker, 2nd Baronet CB (3 January 1787 – 2 November 1859) was an officer of the British Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars against France and her allies, and also in the War of 1812 against the United States.
Biography.
Baker was born in Nancy, France, the eldest surviving son of Sir Robert Baker, Bt., and Dinah Hayley, the daughter of William Hayley, Alderman and MP for the City of London.
Baker entered the Royal Navy in December 1797 as a first class volunteer aboard the frigate "Unite" under the command of Captain Charles Rowley. He then served aboard the brig-sloop under Captains Charles Wollaston and James Brisbane, before returning to Captain Rowley to serve as a midshipman in , all in home waters, until the peace of 1802.
In July 1802 he joined under Captain Bendall Robert Littlehales, and after taking part in the capture of Saint Lucia under Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, he and Littlehales returned home aboard the hired brig "Morne Fortunee" with despatches in June 1803. He was then attached to , Captain the Honourable Alexander Cochrane, but soon returned to the West Indies to serve aboard under Captain John Bligh in operations at Saint-Domingue. Baker took part in the blockade of Cape François; the capture of Fort Dauphin, where two forts and a 28-gun ship "La Sagesse", were taken; and the surrender of the French squadron with the remains of General Rochambeau's army on board.
On 16 July 1804 Baker followed Captain Bligh into the frigate with the rank of acting-lieutenant. In March 1805 he was transferred 18-gun "Reynard" under the command of Captain Jeremiah Coghlan. On 20 March the "Reynard" destroyed a large French privateer "General Ernouf", as a result of which Baker's commission was confirmed and backdated to 18 October 1804. In December 1805 he joined the "Fortunée" under Captain Henry Vansittart, then from May 1806 served aboard "Mediator" under Captain William Furlong Wise as first lieutenant. He took part in the capture of several privateers, and the storming of the fort at Samaná on 14 February 1807. He then served aboard , the flagship of Rear-Admiral James Richard Dacres.
Baker returned home in late 1807 and joined the under Captain William Roberts, then under Captain Rowley again, and under George Sayer. In August 1809, he took charge of a gun-boat, and was particularly mentioned by Sir George Cockburn for his part at the bombardment of Vlissingen during the Walcheren Campaign. On 15 August 1810, he assumed command of a 10-gun schooner named "Anholt", and served as second in command under Captain James Wilkes Maurice at the defence of Anholt, in March 1811 when that island was attacked by a Danish force at least four times larger than the British garrison. Baker in "Anholt" played a major part in the defeat of the enemy by bearing down along the northern shore of the island, and placing them between two fires. This was acknowledged, on his arrival in England with despatches, by promotion to the rank of commander dated 8 April 1811.
On 28 October 1812 Baker was appointed to command of the brig , and on 18 March 1814 to the brig-sloop , both on the North America Station. In August 1814 he took part in operations on the Potomac River; at the capture of Fort Washington, and the capitulation of Alexandria. In the despatches of Captain James Alexander Gordon, he was praised for his conduct, particularly for his part in preventing the grounded from falling into the hands of the enemy. Following the surrender of Guadeloupe in August 1815, in which he also took part, he was received promotion to post-captain, backdated to 13 June 1815, and about the same time made a Companion of the Bath.
On 27 June 1820 he married Louisa Ann Williams, the daughter of William Williams of Belmont House, South Lambeth, formerly MP for Weymouth, and had two sons and five daughters. He succeeded his father as second baronet on 4 February 1826.
On 29 July 1840, Baker was selected by Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Digby, Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, to be his flag captain in the at Sheerness. In October 1841, a few days after transferring with Digby to "Camperdown", while in attendance on the Lords of the Admiralty, he unfortunately broke his leg and received other severe injuries. He resigned the command of "Camperdown" in December, and on 19 January 1842 was granted a pension of £180. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 6 November 1850, and to vice-admiral on 9 July 1857. Vice-Admiral Baker died on 2 November 1859.

Willingway Hospital

Willingway Hospital, located in Statesboro, Georgia, is a privately owned hospital which specializes in treating alcoholism and drug addiction. The treatment modality at Willingway Hospital is based on the principles of the twelve-step program, Alcoholics Anonymous. It is referred to by many as “The Betty Ford Center of the South.”
Programs.
Willingway offers the following levels of care:
Patients are evaluated and placed in the level of care most appropriate for their needs. Each patient’s program is completely individualized.
Facts and Figures.
Willingway is licensed as a specialized hospital by the Georgia Department of Human Resources and is accredited by JCAHO. The average length of stay is 25.62 days. The number of annual admits totals at 512. Approximately 33% of all patients are female, and 12% are under the age of 25.
History.
Although Willingway was not established until 1971, its story began in 1959 when Dr. John Mooney and his wife Dot, recovering from alcoholism themselves, began taking alcoholics into their home in hopes of showing them a new way of life. Their hopes were realized, and seemingly hopeless men and women found themselves free from alcoholic bondage as a result of the care given to them by the doctor and his wife. As word spread about the Mooneys, it became evident that the house on Lee Street simply didn’t have enough room for all those seeking treatment. As a result, they began building Willingway, a 40-bed facility. Willingway became a licensed hospital on August 11, 1971. John Mooney stepped down as Director of Willingway in 1982. However, the couple’s four children, Al, Jimmy, Bobby, and Carol Lind still make up the hospital’s Board of Directors.
The oldest son, Al, is co-author of "The Recovery Book", known by many as the Bible of addiction medicine.
Community.
Many patients that go to Willingway Hospital end up staying in Statesboro and becoming active members of their community. Georgia Southern University, also located in Statesboro, GA, and the Willingway Foundation (Willingway’s nonprofit organization) teamed up in an effort to create a Center for Addiction Recovery on Georgia Southern University’s campus. The center provides all recovering alcoholics and drug addicts with the opportunity to maximize their college experience while minimizing their risk of returning to old behaviors. The Center for Addiction Recovery is modeled after a federally funded program currently in place at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX. The center offers scholarship opportunities, admissions guidance, 12-step meetings, and many other resources.

The Princeton University Glee Club is the oldest singing group in existence at Princeton. It was founded in 1874 by Andrew Fleming West '74, who later became the first Dean of the Graduate College. The Glee Club is currently celebrating its 139th season of concerts.
In 1907 Charles E. Burnham was the first professional musician to lead the Glee Club. He was succeeded in 1918 by Alexander Russell, who served until 1934, when the Glee Club became a responsibility of the music faculty. James Giddings became director in 1934, Timothy Cheney in 1940, J. Merrill Knapp in 1941, Russell Ames Cook in 1943, J. Merrill Knapp again in 1946, Elliot Forbes in 1952, Carl Weinrich in 1953, Walter L. Nollner in 1958, William Trego in 1992, Richard Tang Yuk in 1994, Robert Isaacs in 2009, and Gabriel Crouch since 2010.
On the eve of the College football games in 1913, the Glee Club held its first concerts with the Glee Clubs of Harvard and Yale Universities, beginning a tradition of joint concerts that have continued to this day.
The Princeton University Glee Club was involved in some remarkable projects in the 1930s. They gave the American Premiere of Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex" with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1931; performances of Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder" and Wagner's "Parsifal" in 1932 and 1933; Bach's "Mass in B Minor" at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1935; and with the Vassar College Choir, gave the first United States performance of Jean Philippe Rameau's "Castor et Pollux" in 1937.
The Glee Club continued to sing with women's choral groups from Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges until a mixed Princeton chorus was formed after the advent of coeducation.
From 1958 to 1992 Walter L. Nollner led the Glee Club, giving him the honor of the longest tenure of any previous conductor. Under his direction the choir traveled outside the United States for the first time, establishing a pattern of international concert tours to Europe, Asia, South America and the South Pacific, including two around-the-world tours. In honour of Professor Nollner's service to the Glee Club, an endowment fund has been established in his name to assist the Glee Club with its yearly operations. The Nollner Endowment Fund was officially launched in February 1999.
The Glee Club has continued their tradition of overseas concert tours (most recently traveling to Buenos Aires, Paris, Leipzig and Prague) and expanded the repertoire to include more works of the twentieth-century. The Glee Club presents several concerts every year in the spectacular acoustic of Alexander Hall on the Princeton campus. They perform a major oratorio each spring with professional soloists and orchestra. Recent masterworks performed include Orff's Carmina Burana, Mendelssohn's "Elijah", Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" and "Mass in B minor", Mozart's "Requiem", and Honneger's "Le Roi David".

Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle (Jackson, Mississippi)

The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter the Apostle is the seat of the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Mississippi. The cathedral is named for Saint Peter the Apostle.
History.
The Diocese of Natchez was created July 28, 1837, and included all of Mississippi. In 1841, Bishop John J. Chanche arrived in Natchez and set out to construct parishes. The Mississippi legislature granted land to several congregations in Jackson and Bishop Chanche dedicated the new Catholic church at Court and President Streets to Saint Peter the Apostle on August 23, 1846.
The wood-frame church was burned during the Civil War by General William Tecumseh Sherman in 1862 and the congregation met in various locations around the city. A second structure also burned. Work on the current structure began in 1897 and it was dedicated June 3, 1900. It is constructed in a modified Gothic design of brick with a cruciform floor plan. The front facade features a square tower topped with a spire that reaches a height of .
In 1948, the administrative center of the Diocese of Natchez was transferred to Jackson and the see was renamed the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson. In February 1957, the church was raised to the rank of co-cathedral and when part of the territory was split to form the Diocese of Biloxi in 1977, St. Peter's was named as cathedral of the Diocese of Jackson.
In 1988, the church's Kilgen organ was replaced with a two-manual/26-rank instrument by Rieger Orgelbau of Austria. The organ is dedicated to the memory of Bishop Joseph Brunini, who served from 1968 to 1984.
The cathedral was renovated in the 1980s, and in 1998, an activities building to house offices, a parish hall and classrooms was added in a style that blends with the design of the church. In 2010, the church underwent major renovations. The steeple was rebuilt and sheathed in copper and slate, and capped with a new cross. The roof of the main building was repaired and brick was tuckpointed. Stained glass windows and their frames were cleaned, sealed and covered with protective glass and electrical and sound systems were upgraded. Earlier inspections of the tower and steeple revealed dry rot, leaks, termite damage and other structural problems which were made worse by damage sustained during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The Cathedral of Saint Peter the Apostle is the seat of the Bishop of Jackson, Mississippi, and holds daily and weekly masses in English and Spanish.

Stephen Cosgrove (writer)

Stephen Cosgrove, born July 26, 1945, is a children's author and toy designer. He is known for the "Serendipity" series of children's books, which formed the basis for 26-episode anime series "Serendipity the Pink Dragon".
Early life & education.
Cosgrove was born in Metaline Falls, Washington and raised in Kennewick, Washington, then Burley and Boise, Idaho. He attended Borah High School in Boise, Idaho. Growing up, Cosgrove was greatly influenced by Aesop’s Fables.
In 1963, he received a scholarship for and attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri.
Writing career.
In 1973, Cosgrove teamed with illustrator Robin James, and wrote his first four books which began the Serendipity Series: "Serendipity", "Wheedle on the Needle", "The Dream Tree", and "The Muffin Muncher". His goal in writing these books was to create interesting, fun, affordable books that contained a moral in each story. The next year, a large New York publishing company offered Stephen a contract, but he refused and continued on in his search for a publisher. Three months later, Cosgrove established his own publishing company, Serendipity Press, where he was the author, publisher, shipping clerk, and janitor.
In 1978, after selling over 3 million books, Cosgrove sold Serendipity Press to Penguin/Putnam and began focusing on multi-media literature for children.
In 1990, Cosgrove and Wendy Edelson were awarded the Silver Jubilee Honor by the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association (PNBA) for "Ira Woodworthy".
In 2002, Cosgrove created the websites Web-pop, Book-pop, and Chatty Hattie where children can read stories online with colorful and interactive illustrations. Two years later, in 2004, he created the website BuggBooks, where children can have stories read to them by the author.
Currently, Stephen Cosgrove has written around 325 books, ranging from picture books for younger children to young adult novels.

Bacterial cellular morphologies

Bacteria are classified by direct examination with the light microscope through its morphology and aggregation.
The basic forms are spheres (coccus) and round-ended cylinders (bacillus). But there may be others such as helically twisted cylinders (spirochetes), cylinders curved in one plane (Selenomonads) and unusual morphologies (such as the square Archaea Haloquadratum). They also conform diplos, tetrads, staphylos, streptos, palizadas etc.
Coccus.
A coccus (plural "cocci", from the Latin "coccinus" (scarlet) and derived from the Greek "kokkos" (berry)) is any microorganism (usually bacteria) whose overall shape is spherical or nearly spherical. Describing a bacterium as a coccus, or sphere, distinguishes it from bacillus, or rod. This is the first of many taxonomic traits for identifying and classifying a bacterium according to binomial nomenclature.
Aggregations.
Aggregations of coccoid bacteria often occur and these forms have specific names as well; listed here are the basic forms as well as representative bacterial genera:
Diplococcus.
A diplococcus (plural "diplococci") is a round bacterium (a coccus) that typically occurs in pairs of two joined cells. Examples are "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Moraxella catarrhalis", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae" and "Neisseria meningitidis".
Its name comes from diplo, meaning double, and coccus, meaning berry. This is because berries are round, like a diplococcus, and diplococci come in pairs of two.
In former times, a bacterial genus "Diplococcus" was recognized, but it is not used anymore.
Coccobacillus.
A coccobacillus (plural "coccobacilli") is a type of rod-shaped bacteria. The word "coccobacillus" reflects an intermediate shape between "coccus" (spherical) and "bacillus" (elongated). Coccobacilli rods are so short and wide that they resemble cocci. "Haemophilus influenzae" and "Chlamydia trachomatis" are coccobacilli. "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans" is a gram negative coccobacillus which is prevalent in subgingival plaques. "Acinetobacter" strains may grow on solid media as coccobacilli.
"Coxiella burnetti" is also a coccobacillus.
Clinical significance.
Important human pathogens caused by coccoid bacteria include staphylococci infections, some types of food poisoning, some urinary tract infections, toxic shock syndrome, gonorrhea, as well as some forms of meningitis, throat infections, pneumonias, and sinusitis.
Bacillus.
Although "Bacillus", capitalized and italicized, specifically refers to the genus, the word bacillus (plural "bacilli") may also be used to describe any rod-shaped bacterium, and in this sense, bacilli are found in many different taxonomic groups of bacteria. There is no connection between the shape of a bacterium and its colors in the Gram staining.
Bacilli are usually solitary, but can combine to form diplobacilli, streptobacilli, and palisades.
MacConkey agar can be used to distinguish among Gram negative bacilli.

Diplomatic Protection Squad

The Diplomatic Protection Squad (DPS) is a branch of the New Zealand Police that provides personal security for both national and visiting VIPs. National VIPs protected include the Prime Minister, the Governor General, Ministers of the Crown, and the Leader of the Opposition, both within New Zealand and abroad. Previous visiting VIPs afforded DPS protection have included Tiger Woods during the 2002 New Zealand Open, and FBI Director Robert Mueller.
The squad is based in the capital Wellington, where the majority of foreign diplomatic missions are. Officers are experienced members of the New Zealand Police, who pass the DPS course at the Royal New Zealand Police College. The course has training on topics such as diplomatic immunity and unarmed combat. Squad members usually operate in plain clothes, and both genders can be squad members.
The New Zealand Police established the DPS in the mid-1970s, to meet New Zealand's obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Consular Relations.
In the 2011-12 financial year the squad spent approximately $5.2 million - $1.1 million over budget.
Equipment.
The DPS routinely carry firearms, in contrast to the regular police which generally do not. A 1993 report for the U.S. World Factbook of Criminal Justice Systems stated DPS officers have access to semi-automatic machine pistols.
In May 2008, the DPS were testing a Holden Captiva SUV, to replace the unmarked Holden sedans in use at the time.
Incidents.
When the Prime Minister travels by road the DPS normally have a vehicle following behind, closer than is generally safe, to prevent other vehicles getting in between. The close proximity of the escort vehicle has caused a few minor nose-to-tail accidents, such as twice in six weeks during 2000, and on Ponsonby Road on 9 December 2005.

Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team

The Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team is an award presented annually by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) and Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS). It was first awarded at the 1st Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony, held in 1974 when the award was originally called Outstanding Individual Director for a Drama Series. Therefore, between 1974 and 1978; the award only honored individual directors. In 1979, the award was renamed Outstanding Direction for a Drama Series before using its current title years later. Since then, the award has honored the performances of the entire directing team participating in a form of a daytime drama. The awards ceremony was not aired on television in 1983 and 1984, having been criticized for lack of integrity. The Emmy was named after an "Immy," an affectionate term used to refer to the image orthicon camera tube. The statuette was designed by Louis McManus, who modeled the award after his wife, Dorothy. The Emmy statuette is fifteen inches tall from base to tip, weighs five pounds and is composed of iron, pewter, zinc and gold.
Richard Dunlap has received the most wins for his direction on "The Young and the Restless", with a total of two. The soap opera holds the record for the most awards, winning on thirteen occasions (including Dunlap's wins), also "The Bold and the Beautiful" tied in 2011 with the soap, which was the first tie in this category.

Khan Tuman (building)

Khan Tuman () is a large khan is located in the village of Khan Tuman, about fifteen kilometers south of Aleppo, on the west bank of the Quweiq River. It was built in 1189 by Ayyubid Emir Tuman Nuri as a rural khan to protect travelers on the trade route linking the Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea. A second khan was added abutting its southern wall in 1478 by Mamluk Sultan Qaitbey (1468–1496). In 1652 Ipshir Pasha, governor of Aleppo until 1654 consolidated the khans to provide a safer shelter for travelers. Only a portion of the Mamluk khan remains today, after the complex was partly demolished to accommodate the Latakia-Aleppo railroad in 1970.
Architecture.
The twelfth century khan was built with large stone blocks and consisted of a rectangular courtyard measuring about thirty by twenty meters, surrounded by a vaulted hall on all sides. The southern wing was divided into four sections; the vaulted entry vestibule at center, with a room to its west and a two room mosque with a mihrab to its east. The vaulted hall enveloping the courtyard was accessed through two archways on each courtyard wall, while the room to the west of the entrance was accessed through the entryway and through the courtyard. The mosque was primarily entered from the entry vestibule and also opened onto a small chamber to its east entered from the courtyard. To the north, the hall was roofed with cross vaults resting on rectangular pillars embedded in its northern wall. Its east and west wings were roofed with longitudinal barrel vaults. After the construction of a khan abutting its southern wall, the primary street entrance for the first khan shifted to its northern wall. 
Built in 1478 the Mamluk khan was also organized around a courtyard, with rooms accessed through an arcade. It was accessed from its south side through a barrel-vaulted gatehouse projecting into the courtyard. 
In 1652, according to an inscription now lost, Ipshir Pasha made several modifications. He constructed waterworks and provided Khan Tuman with a qastal or fountain located in the south khan to the east of the gatehouse. The fountain, which has remained, is two steps down from the courtyard, with an archway supported on two engaged columns in the shape of interlaced ropes. Its operation was supported by the income of a stable, a coffeehouse and two shops built on the second floor of the northern khan, and seventeen rental rooms, built on the second floor of the southern khan. Ipshir Pasha also built arched "iwans" flanked by rooms above the gatehouses of the south and north khans, and paved the prayer hall of the north khan entrance.

Victory Square, Kaliningrad

Victory Square (, "Ploshchad Pobedy") is a central square in Kaliningrad.
Prior to 1945, the square was part of Königsberg, Germany. Steindamm Gate, part of the city's northwestern Baroque city walls, was dismantled in 1912 to allow development of the area between Steindamm and the Hufen suburbs. The road leading from central Königsberg to Mittelhufen was known first as Kaiser-Wilhelm-Damm in honor of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. After the abdication of the House of Hohenzollern in 1918, the road was renamed to Hansaring and the prominent square nearby to Hansaplatz, honoring the city's participation in the Hanseatic League from 1339-1579. The square was then renamed Adolf-Hitler-Platz in 1934 to honor the Nazi leader. East of the square were the grounds of the Ostmesse trade fair. Königsberg was transferred to the Soviet Union in 1945 and then renamed Kaliningrad.
While most of central Königsberg was destroyed during World War II, the northern suburban area around the square survived intact. Post-war Kaliningrad developed around the square, which was renamed Victory Square to honor the Russian victory. Many banks, shops, malls, and the city government are in the vicinity of the square. The Kaliningrad Severny railway station, formerly the Königsberg Nordbahnhof built in 1930, is a business centre. The Handelshof or Stadthaus, built by Hanns Hopp in 1923, still functions as the seat of the city administration as Kaliningrad City Hall. Kaliningrad State Technical University is located in the former provincial court, while the FSB have offices in the former police headquarters.
During the celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of the city in 2005 the square was thoroughly renovated. A new fountain was placed in the centre and the new Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was consecrated in the same year. The statue of Lenin, previously in front of the cathedral, was removed from the square and in 2006 placed at another site in Kaliningrad.

Speculoscopy

Speculoscopy is a procedure in which a special blue-white light (Speculite) is used to examine the cervix for cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions. 
Acetic acid is applied to the cervix, it is let sit for 60 seconds, then the cervix is examined with 4-6x magnification. The light is generated by a chemiluminescent light stick, which is attached to the inner side of the upper blade of the vaginal speculum by an adhesive strip. The test can be used to complement a pap smear in screening of cervical cancer. A negative speculoscopy, along with a negative pap smear provides greater assurance of absence of disease.
It was developed in 1988. It was FDA approved as an add-on to Pap smear screening in 1995.
At this time there is no CPT/HCPCS code for this and most medical insurance companies do not cover this procedure.
Light strip provides light for 15–20 minutes.

Unnatural Love

"Unnatural Love" is the fifth episode of the second season of the HBO comedy series "Flight of the Conchords", and the seventeenth episode overall. It first aired on February 15, 2009. The episode was directed by Michel Gondry and written by Iain Morris and Damon Beesley. Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the band Flight of the Conchords star as fictional versions of themselves. The plot focuses on Jemaine's forbidden romance with the Australian Keitha (Sarah Wynter), which chagrins his fellow New Zealanders Bret and Murray (Rhys Darby), the band's manager.
"Unnatural Love" was well received by critics. It earned Clement a 2009 Emmy nomination for Best Comedy Actor and received two Creative Arts Emmy nominations, one for Outstanding Sound Mixing and one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for the song "Carol Brown". The two songs featured in the episode, "Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)" and "Carol Brown", were well received critically and subsequently appeared on the album "I Told You I Was Freaky".
Plot.
Flight of the Conchords manager Murray (Rhys Darby) brings a reluctant Bret (Bret McKenzie) and Jemaine (Jemaine Clement) to a nightclub to experience "dancing music", recruiting their friend Dave (Arj Barker) to compel them inside. Finding the club overpopulated with men, the three sing "Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)". Jemaine goes home with a woman (Sarah Wynter), but when he awakes the next morning, he finds himself surrounded by Australian memorabilia. He suspects he has slept with an Australian, a major taboo for New Zealanders, and attempts to sneak out, calling Bret for help when he cannot unlock the door. However, the woman catches him, introducing herself as Keitha, a rough, crude Australian.
Keitha asks Jemaine to stay longer, but he leaves and goes straight to the doctor for a checkup. Later, at a band meeting with Murray, Bret reveals Jemaine's escapade. Bret and Murray express their shock and dismay, even contemplating temporarily ejecting Jemaine from the band. Murray asks Jemaine if he still has his wallet; as it happens Jemaine has left his wallet in Keitha's apartment. He goes back to retrieve it, and questions Keitha over tea about her family background to determine exactly how Australian she is. She explains that she is quite Australian, proudly descended from criminals. She invites him back to bed.
Jemaine and Keitha start dating. He introduces her to Bret and Murray, but they refuse to accept her. Later, Bret unsuccessfully attempts to fool Jemaine by poorly mimicking Keitha's voice and leaving a fake break-up message on the answering machine. Jemaine goes to Keitha's apartment, where he learns her two Australian housemates similarly disprove of him (though Keitha states this is not because he is from New Zealand, but because they consider him a "dick" and not attractive enough for her). Nonetheless, Keitha still likes Jemaine. Jemaine sings "Carol Brown".
Jemaine and Keitha decide to elope to New Jersey, with the assistance of Dave, who approves of their forbidden love, comparing it to "that movie, Interracial Hole Stretchers 2". However, Keitha fails to show up at their predetermined meeting spot. Jemaine realizes something is amiss when the carriage driver explains he cannot go to New Jersey, despite Keitha's earlier claims. Jemaine rushes home, where he discovers Keitha and her friends have cleaned out the apartment and duct taped Bret to the door.
Production.
"Unnatural Love" was written by Iain Morris and Damon Beesley, who also wrote the Season 1 episode "The Actor". It was directed by Michel Gondry, who brought his characteristic visual style to the episode, particularly the music scenes.
The bouncer at the night club who leads the conga line during "Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor" is Randy Jones, the original cowboy from the disco group Village People.
The khaki shirt and shorts that Jemaine is wearing when Bret and Murray first meet Keitha is a reference to Steve Irwin.
When Jemaine calls Bret the morning after sleeping with Keitha, Bret is reading A. W. B. Powell's "Native Animals of New Zealand", a commonly used reference book in New Zealand classrooms. The book is an iconic piece of kiwiana and is frequently cited as an inspiration by New Zealand visual artists.
Songs.
The following songs appear in this episode:
"Too Many Dicks (On the Dance Floor)".
After Dave asks Bret and Jemaine to give him more space on the dance floor, the band sings this dance track about a nightclub populated by too many men. Arj Barker as Dave provides a guest rap.
Flight of the Conchords included "Too Many Dicks" on their 2009 album "I Told You I Was Freaky", and several reviewers singled it out for praise. Jamie Crossan of NME called the song "undeniably the highlight" of the album. Jason Lymangrover of AllMusic similarly considered it one of the album's stronger tracks. David Gassman of PopMatters particularly praised Arj Barker's guest appearance as elevating the song's humor. Zach Kelly of Pitchfork approvingly called "Too Many Dicks" a "trashy B-more club bounce" that worked even outside the context of the episode. Similarly, Maddy Costa of "The Guardian" found it one of the songs that holds up well regardless of prior knowledge of its musical references or the episode. On the other hand, Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" considered the song "hilarious in the context of the T.V. show", but believed it ran together with other similar songs when devoid of the visuals.
"Carol Brown".
Jemaine's budding romance with Keitha inspires him to sing "Carol Brown". In the lyrics Jemaine details the various ways his previous girlfriends left him, including the titular Carol Brown, who "just took a bus out of town". He is accompanied by a chorus of all his ex-girlfriends, who appear in video projected behind him to sing about his many deficiencies as a boyfriend. Jemaine and Bret play contraptions consisting of guitar necks attached to video editing equipment; Bret's device affects the scene as he moves its controls.
The song was written by Clement and McKenzie with series co-creator James Bobin. Sia Furler, Alison Sudol, Inara George, Nadia Ackerman, Jo Bobin, and Victoria Bobin provide vocals for the chorus of ex-girlfriends.
"Carol Brown" earned "Flight of the Conchords" a Creative Arts Emmy nomination for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2009. Television critic Alan Sepinwall enjoyed both songs, but considered the "Carol Brown" sequence "perfection", finding that director Michel Gondry's handling of the visuals complemented the music particularly well. The Conchords included "Carol Brown" on "I Told You I Was Freaky", and several reviewers identified it as a highlight of the album. Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" called it "the album's masterpiece", writing that its "fun mash-up of lo-fi alterna-folk Casio tones and swell Burt Bacharach backing vocals" humorously undercut the downbeat subject matter. Huw Jones of Slant Magazine called the song "conceivably the Conchords' most formidable piece of songwriting to date". Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" called it one of Flight of the Conchords' "best individual tracks". Mike Diver of BBC Music found it one of the album's better songs, calling it "subdued of arrangement and all the more delightful for it". Jamie Crossan of NME praised it as "lush LOLsome twee pop". Zeth Lundy of the "Boston Phoenix" commended "Carol Brown" for emphasizing songwriting more than other "Weird Al-style" musical parodies on the album.
Broadcast and reception.
"Unnatural Love" first aired on HBO February 15, 2009. It received over 826,000 viewers. The episode was well received by critics. "Time" television critic James Poniewozik gave it an "honorable mention" in his list of the best television episodes of 2009, the only "Flight of the Conchords" episode he included. Critic Alan Sepinwall wrote in "The Star-Ledger" that both the comedy and music in "Unnatural Love" represented "Flight of the Conchords" "functioning at peak level", finding that the strong songs and their associated video sequences set the episode above others of the second season. He also appreciated Gondry's direction and the humorously stereotyped characterization of Keitha, as well as the "unexpected judgmental side" she exposed in Bret. Similarly, Kyle Ryan of "The A.V. Club" considered the music to be an improvement over previous Season 2 episodes. He further praised the Australian jokes and the contributions of Gondry and Arj Barker, giving the episode an A-. Matt Fowler of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, praising the over-the-top portrayal of the Australian-New Zealand discord and the song "Carol Brown".
"Unnatural Love" earned Clement a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009. It also earned two Creative Arts Emmy nominations, one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for "Carol Brown", and a second for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation.

Al-Omari Mosque (Bosra)

The Al-Omari Mosque () is an early Islamic-era mosque in the Roman city of Bosra, Syria. The mosque is one of the oldest surviving mosques in Islamic history. It was founded by Caliph Umar, who led the Muslim conquest of Syria. The mosque was completed in 721 by the Caliph Yazid II and renovated and expanded in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by the Ayyubids who also fortified the Roman theatre and baths.
Architecture.
The mosque's plan is arranged around an enclosed courtyard wrapped with a single arcade on the eastern and western sides and a double arcade on the southern side that leads to the prayer hall. The courtyard was originally used as a market and sleeping area for traveling caravans on the trade routes across Syria, especially on the annual pilgrimage roads to Mecca. The mosque has one of the earliest examples of an Umayyad square minaret, which was repeated in the other great Umayyad mosques in Damascus and Aleppo.

Navajosuchus

Navajosuchus is an extinct genus of alligatorine crocodylian. Its fossils have been found in the Paleocene-age Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico (United States). It was named in 1942 by Charles C. Mook, and the original type species was "N. novomexicanus". "N. novomexicanus" was based on AMNH 5186, a partial skull collected in 1913. Later research showed that "Navajosuchus novomexicanus" was the same as the earlier-named "Allognathosuchus mooki". However, "A. mooki" may or may not belong to the genus "Allognathosuchus", and if it does not, the name of the crocodilian would become "Navajosuchus mooki". Under whichever name is used, this animal would have been a generalized predator of the Nacimiento floodplains. It was the most common Nacimiento Formation crocodilian, found in both the Puercan and Torrejonian faunal assemblages.

Acqua pazza (wine)

The drink acqua pazza is a type of wine by-product made by peasants in the Tuscan region of Italy from the leftovers of wine production. Also called acquarello, mezzone, or vinello, it has been described as "a watered down wine of second choice" by Apergi and Bianco (1991, 87).
Origin.
In Tuscany, the "mezzadria" peasants were involved in wine production, but most of the wine produced went to the landlord. This leaving little for them to drink, they would supply themselves with wine by mixing the stems, seeds, and pomace left over from the wine production with large quantities of water, bringing it to a boil, then hermetically sealing it in a terracotta vase and letting it ferment for several days. It was then drunk as it was, slightly effervescent.

MickDeth

Mick Richard Morris (March 9, 1978 – June 2, 2013) better known as MickDeth, was an American bassist and guitarist. He was a part of the bands Eighteen Visions, Clear and Misfits cover band, Die Die My Darling.
Biography.
He was raised in Utah, along with his three sisters and brother, by his grandparents. At an early age, he adopted the straight edge lifestyle, having grown up in an environment where drugs were very prominent in his life. With such things surrounding his world, Morris decided that he did not want a part of it, ever. As Mick made mention, "Living in Salt Lake City, if you wear anything 'satanic'—even Straight edge because in Salt Lake, that is considered a gang—you can be kicked out of school." Morris attended Highland High School. During his time at Highland High School, he was in the band Elsewhere. Morris dropped out of high school to pursue his music career, originally supposed to graduate in 1996. Though he returned to get his diploma, and graduated when he was 20, in 1998.
MickDeth got into music early on in life. Ever since he saw Metallica's video for their 1989 single "One", he knew he wanted to play music. His father was always supportive of him, playing the guitar himself. He picked up the guitar when he was twelve years old. Morris has been listening to classic rock, punk, 1980s metal, thrash and death metal, hardcore, and gangster rap.
He had been getting tattoos since he turned twenty. His first tattoo was "Drug Free" on his forearm in Milwaukee on Clear's second tour. He stated that he has almost 100 skulls and 200 letters on his body. His most notable tattoos were "Lifeless" across his knuckles, paying tribute to a fellow SLC band, and a portrait of Dimebag Darrell on his calf done by Kat Von D (which was briefly shown on the show "Miami Ink").
When Morris moved to California, he held a job at Paul Frank from 2000 until 2003 (when Eighteen Visions became a full-time band). He has modeled for To Die For Clothing as well as Shockhound.com.
Morris was also a judge for the seventh annual Independent Music Awards.
More recently on his Twitter profile, he announced that he had not been straight edge for two years.
Clear.
Clear (originally XclearX) was a straight edge hardcore band from the mid 1990s out of Salt Lake City. MickDeth had always been a fan of the band, going to all of their shows. One day in 1997, Morris received a phone call and was asked to try out for the band when their previous guitarist left. They wrote and recorded a full-length, "Deeper Than Blood", which was released in 1999. After Josh left Clear, they added a replacement guitarists and did another tour. After that tour, Mick announced that it was his turn to part ways with the band, mostly for musical differences and stating that they were not really writing songs anymore. Once Mick left the band in 2000, Clear decided not to continue on without him. In February 2007, Clear played a reunion show on February 16, 2007 at the SLUG 18th anniversary show. On the day of the show, Mick stated that he's "never felt the same passion for another band that I felt for Clear."
Eighteen Visions.
In late 1999 and early 2000, Clear and Eighteen Visions did an east coast tour together. Six months later, he got a phone call from singer James Hart asking him if he wanted to join the band as bass player. Mick immediately said yes, packed his things up and moved out to California. Before joining Eighteen Visions, Mick had never played bass in his life. During his time in Eighteen Visions, Mick recorded five albums with them. They toured the world, gaining fame and fans. After recording Obsession, they signed to major label Epic Records. On April 9, 2007, Mick announced that Eighteen Visions was no longer.
Other bands.
Elsewhere.
Elsewhere was a shoegazing, goth rock band from Salt Lake City that started in high school. Mick has described it to be similar to The Cure and Joy Division. They were on the label Eden's Watchtower.
Die Die My Darling.
Die Die My Darling is a Misfits cover band from Orange County. Mick took a part of Die Die My Darling with fellow Eighteen Visions member Ken Floyd, Bleeding Through's Brandan Schieppati and ex-Burn It Down member, Ryan Downey. Mick played two of three shows with the band, one in 2003 at the Show Case Theatre in Corona, CA and one in 2005 at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA.
Bleeding Through.
Morris filled in on bass for Bleeding Through during 2002 for their record Portrait of the Goddess album. He toured with them in 2002, appearing on the Hellfest '02, Furnace Fest 2002 and Bleeding Through's Wolves Among Sheep DVDs.
Post Eighteen Visions.
Since the breakup of Eighteen Visions, Mick has toured with Hatebreed as their guitar tech on Ozzfest in 2007, on their spring–summer tour of 2008 and their Mexico City show in early 2009. He was working for shockhound (a part of Hot Topic) and he sold clothes as well as occasionally his old equipment on eBay and craigslist.
Dethless Clothing.
In 2007, Mick started Dethless Clothing. A couple of months after the breakup of Eighteen Visions, Dethless seemed to be finished before it really took off due to personal and financial restraints. On February 21, 2009, Mick announced via MySpace that Dethless Clothing is back in full swing starting with pre-orders on April 1, 2009. Starting April 1, 2009 at midnight a link was set up on the Dethless MySpace to pre-order the first run of blood splatter Dethless shirts. Also, a website is under construction for Dethless Clothing.
Death.
On June 2, 2013, Morris died in his sleep from a pre-existing heart condition. He had been in and out of the hospital recently but had been released, according to former co-workers. He is survived by his soulmate Ashley Jade Thewlis, who was also the mother of his two year old son Jude Ashton Morris, and his family.

Brazilian Workers Confederation

The Brazilian Workers Confederation (; abbreviated COB) is the first trade union of workers from Brazil. Founded in 1906, after intense union activity, its membership declined dramatically in the 1930s due to a split brought on by internal conflict and government repression, until it was revived in 1986.
Inspired by the French CGT, the COB was created from revolutionary unionist perspective. The COB is associated with the International Workers Association (, AIT).
History.
Foundation, rise and fall.
The COB was founded in 1906 in the Congress of Workers of Brazil, which determined the start of its operation for 1908. Inspired by the model of the French "Confédération générale du travail", which was then loyal to the First International unionism had its temporary headquarters in the streets of the Hospice, 156 in Rio de Janeiro, and its secretary general at that time was Ramiro Moreira Lobo.
He had a role in the general strike in São Paulo in July 1917. Their militancy was intense, because the Brazilian trade union movement was influenced by a significant revolutionary unions and anarchists, led especially by the section of the COB of São Paulo (FOSP), until it began to decline after 1935 with the dictatorship of Gertulio Vargas and because most of the unions began to be controlled by political parties, to disappear in practice. After this there remained small libertarian but only workers from the mid-1970s began to regain some its presence in the labor movement.
Reactivation and relaunch.
Due to the existence of trade unionism by the Coptic and in control of left-wing political parties, organizations were formed for the freedom of trade union militancy through the so-called "opposition agreement". Some of the anarchist workers' groups participated in such competitions through the union of Oposição a Libertarian Coletivo Estrutura Association, Cloe, and CLOS, or Libertarian Coletivo of Oposição Association, who served between 1979 and 1984.
At the congress of the formation of CUT (in which various factions joined unions), the proposals were rejected CLOS, that's when it dissociates itself from this which was now being copte by the Workers' Party. From this fact articulate regional groups to guide the regional Protest Days Libertarias who were preparing for further decisions by the Anarchist Congress 100 years from May 1, making the emergence in 1986 the Movement for revival of the CBD / AIT.
Principles and organization.
Today the union is reducing its anarcho-syndicalist organization and opposes criticism of institutionalized bureaucratic unions, to these states that are delineated by an authoritarian and partisanship unable to express the reality interests of the working class. For this reason, the COB promotes a fair pay adjustment that ensures the needs of life and calls for the reduction of shift for all job categories, with the intention of establishing the conditions for release of workers in the domain of state and the government as well as political parties that support them.
It is made up mostly of independent trade unions "sindivários," union of arts and crafts style of the various unions for various Spanish or Argentine resistance societies, these unions are established in various cities, the COB integrates its while two regional federations that are FOSP (Federação Operária São Paulo) and FORGS (Federação Operária do Rio Grande do Sul) also profile anarchist. In the confederation political parties unable to participate nor affiliated to them. Currently both the federations as the regional confederation are in the process of restructuring and activation. The COB is linked to the reconstruction process of the Continental American Workers Association (ACAT) and is part of the International Workers Association (AIT), the latter is the largest international trade union anarchists.
Federations.
Operária Federação de São Paulo (FOSP), Federation of Labor of São Paulo, is a former workers' organization paulistas now has been reactivated, with the FOSP there Workers' Federation Rio Grande do Sul (FORGS) which has the same federal status. Were based mostly anarchists at the time suggested that the general strike as a means of struggle. They hold the banner of the First International "The emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves." Are formed by "sindivários" and are currently undergoing restructuring and activation with Confederação Brasileira Operária are part of that.

Analytic confidence

Analytic confidence is a rating employed by intelligence analysts to convey doubt to decision makers about a statement of estimative probability. The need for analytic confidence ratings arise from analysts' imperfect knowledge of a conceptual model. An analytic confidence rating pairs with a statement using a word of estimative probability to form a complete analytic statement. Scientific methods for determining analytic confidence remain in infancy.
Levels of Analytic Confidence in National Security Reports.
In an effort to apply more rigorous standards to National Intelligence Estimates, the National Intelligence Council includes explanations of the three levels of analytic confidence made in estimative statements.
Analytic Confidence's Origins and Early History.
Analytic confidence beginnings coincide with the cognitive psychology movement, especially in psychological decision theory. This branch of psychology did not set out to study analytic confidence as it pertains to intelligence reporting. Rather, the advances in cognitive psychology established a groundwork for understanding well calibrated confidence levels in decision making.
Early accounts of explaining analytic confidence focused on certainty forecasts, as opposed to the overall confidence the analyst had in the analysis itself. This highlights the degree of confusion among scholars about the difference between psychological and analytic confidence. Analysts often lessened certainty statements when confronted with challenging analysis, instead of proscribing a level of analytic confidence to explain those concerns. By lessening certainty levels due to a lack of confidence, a dangerous possibility of misrepresenting the target existed.
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and Analytic Confidence.
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes some guidelines for conveying the analytic confidence in an intelligence product. The summary document states each review should include, among other things, whether the product or products concerned were based on all sources of available intelligence, properly describe the quality and reliability of underlying sources, properly caveat and express uncertainties or confidence in analytic judgments, and properly distinguish between underlying intelligence and the assumptions and judgments of analysts.
Mercyhurst College and Analytic Confidence.
Mercyhurst College students use the Peterson Table of Analytic Confidence Assessment to determine the level of analytic confidence in their estimative statements. The table outlines certain areas in the intelligence cycle important to determining analytic confidence. The key areas of the table include the use of a structured method, overall source reliability, source corroboration and agreement, level of expertise on the subject or topic, amount of peer collaboration, task complexity, and time pressure.

The "Umineko no Naku Koro ni" visual novel series is produced by the Japanese dōjin soft maker 07th Expansion, and are playable on Microsoft Windows PCs. The games take place on the fictional Japanese island Rokkenjima. The head of a wealthy family named Kinzo Ushiromiya, who lives on and owns Rokkenjima, is near death, and eight of his family members arrive on the island to discuss how Kinzo's assets will be divided once he is dead. Also on the island are three family members who live there, five of Kinzo's servants, and his personal physician at the beginning of the story. After the eight family members arrive, a typhoon traps them on the island and shortly after people start to get mysteriously murdered.
"Umineko no Naku Koro ni" is a series of murder mystery visual novels that requires relatively little player interaction as most of the gameplay is composed of reading text which signifies either dialogue between characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist who the player assumes. The games use intermissions where the player can obtain several tips which allow the player to read various supplementary information that may or may not be useful in solving the mystery. The series debuted in Japan in August 2007 with "Legend of the Golden Witch", the first in the series of eight games, ending with "Twilight of the Golden Witch" in December 2010. The first four games share the title "Umineko no Naku Koro ni", but the fifth through eighth games have the common title "Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru". An additional fandisc titled "Umineko no Naku Koro ni Tsubasa" was released in December 2010, and was the final game in the series produced by 07th Expansion. Alchemist released a PlayStation 3 port of the first four games and 07th Expansion released a dōjin fighting game titled "Ougon Musou Kyoku", both in December 2010.

Slippery Rock Brook

Slippery Rock Brook is a tributary of the Passaic River in Passaic County, New Jersey in the United States.
Slippery Rock Brook flows north as it drains part of the western flank of First Watchung Mountain. Traveling south from its confluence with the Passaic River, it passes through the city of Paterson and the borough of Woodland Park.
Course.
Slippery Rock Brook arises south of Weasel Drift Road in Woodland Park and travels north into Garret Mountain Reservation, forming the elongated Barbour Pond, a by natural lake. Turning west, the brook travels a short distance before forming the New Street Reservoir and Highland Lake, both man-made ponds.
At Highland Lake the brook turns north again, flowing under Interstate 80 as it enters Paterson. The brook takes on an urban appearance as it winds its last half mile to the Passaic River with its mouth in Pennington Park. The confluence with the Passaic occurs almost directly opposite the mouth of Molly Ann Brook, with Slippery Rock Brook's mouth approximately upstream.
Ecology.
The majority of Slippery Rock Brook’s riparian corridor has been overrun by urbanization, but a significant section remains intact through Garret Mountain Reservation. South of Barbour Pond, the brook passes through a ravine shaded by a stand of yellow birch and witch-hazel. Rhododendrons and trout lily are known to line the banks along this section of the brook, adding vibrant colors to the riparian environment during the flowering season in May.

Cypress is a former provincial electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. This district was created before the 3rd Saskatchewan general election in 1912 as "Gull Lake". Since the district encompassed most of the Saskatchewan side of the Cypress Hills, the riding was renamed "Cypress" in 1917. Redrawn and renamed "Shaunavon" before 1934, the constituency was abolished before the 9th Saskatchewan general election in 1938.
It is now part of the Cypress Hills and Wood River constituencies.

Jund Qinnasrin

Jund Qinnasrin (, "military district of Qinnasrin") was one of five sub-provinces of Syria under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphate, organized soon after the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century CE. Initially, its capital was Qinnasrin, but as the city declined in population and wealth, the capital was moved to Aleppo. By 985, the district's principal towns were Manbij, Iskandarun, Hamah, Shaizar, Ma'arrat al-Numan, Sumaisat, Jusiya, Wadi-Butnam, Rafaniyya, Lajjun, Mar'ash, Qinnasrin, al-Tinah, Balis, and Suwadiyyah.
History.
Originally a part of Jund Hims, the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I established the Jund Qinnasrin when he defeated Ali and subsequently detached the people of that area from their allegiance to him. 9th century Muslim historian al-Biladhuri says, however, that it was Muawiya's successor Yazid I who founded the district after separating northern territories from Jund Hims. The newly established district was named after the ancient town of Qinnasrin which was located within its boundaries. Under the Umayyads, Jund Qinnasrin composed of three districts: Antioch, Aleppo, and Manbij. 
After caliph al-Mansur's conquests of southern Anatolia, Syria's northern frontiers were considerably extended and in 786, during the reign of the Harun al-Rashid, the now-overgrown Jund Qinnasrin was subdivided. The area toward the northern frontier, comprising the territories of Antioch and the lands east towards Aleppo were split from the district to form Jund al-'Awasim. For the remainder of the Abbasid period, Jund Qinnasrin consisted of the cities of Aleppo (the capital of the district), Qinnasrin and the lands around them, as well as the Sarmin territory.

Conversion of Kartli (chronicle)

The Conversion of Kartli (, transliterated as "mok’ts’evay k’art’lisay") is the earliest surviving medieval Georgian historical compendium, independent from The Georgian Chronicles, the major corpus historicum of medieval Georgia. Written in the 7th and 9th centuries, this chronicle follows the history of Kartli (a core Georgian region known to the Classical authors as Iberia; sometimes archaically referred to all of Georgia) from the earliest times to the 7th century, making a particular focus on Christianization of Georgians by Saint Nino early in the 4th century.
Codices.
The autograph of "The Conversion of Kartli" (CoK) has not survived and until recently there were only two manuscripts which have been extensively studied. These are the codices of Shatberdi and Chelishi.
The Shatberdi Codex, the oldest of the extant CoK manuscripts, was copied in 973 under the supervision of the monk John at the Georgian monastery of Shatberdi in what is now northeastern Turkey. It was discovered in 1888 and published in 1890 by the Georgian scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili. The second variant, Chelishi Codex, so named after a monastery in Georgia where it was found in 1903, was copied in the 14th or 15th century. Following the 1975 fire at Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt, at least two hitherto unknown variants of CoK were discovered among a large number of Georgian manuscripts mainly dated to the 9th/10th century. They have not yet been completely studied, though.
The Shatberdi and Chelishi codices are basically linguistically similar and nearly contemporaneous. The latter, however, contains substantial variations including a number of elaborated passages. Its narrative is longer, but somewhat disfigured orthographically and phonetically by an anonymous copyist. Many passages of the Shatberdi Codex are more informative, but these details are probably later insertions as suggested by the occurrence of the word Baghdad, a post-8th century toponym.
The Shatberdi codex cites some of its sources (such as "a brief account of the conversion of Kartli" by Grigol the Deacon) most of which did not survive and are otherwise unknown. Modern specialists have also proposed Pseudo-Callisthenes’ apocryphal Alexander romance and Alexander of Cyprus’ "Chronica" as possible sources used by the authors of CoK. The work itself was exploited and some of its components were reworked by the later Georgian authors such as Leontius of Ruisi (11th century) and Arsenius the Metaphrast (12th century).
For all its contradictions – the elements of folklore, and religious reminiscences – "The Conversion of Kartli" is an essential historical source. It further possesses a detailed relative and absolute chronology, unparallel in hagiographic and patristic literature of Georgia. The noticeable influence of CoK on subsequent Georgian historical works proves the crucial role this work played in establishing a sense of Christian identity of medieval Georgia.
Component texts.
"The Conversion of Kartli" consists of two major components. The first one is conventionally known as "The Chronicle" (ქრონიკა, "k’ronika"), a brief history of Kartli from the mythic expedition by Alexander the Great into Georgian lands down to the 7th century. Its core text, The Conversion of Kartli, from which the corpus derives its title, relates the story of proselytizing mission by St. Nino, who is also the subject of the last component of CoK, the hagiographic "Life of Nino" (ცხოვრება წმიდა ნინოსი, "ts’xovreba ts’mida ninosi"). The basic text is accompanied by the lists of the kings, presiding princes and prelates of Kartli.

Palatinate-Lautern was a state of the Holy Roman Empire based around Kaiserslautern and Neustadt an der Weinstrasse in the south of modern Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
Palatinate-Lautern was partitioned from the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1576 after the death of Frederick III, Elector Palatine for his younger son John Casimir. John Casimir accepted Huguenot refugees from France and Calvinist exiles from the Palatinate, making it a Calvinist stronghold. John Casimir was convinced by Queen Elizabeth I of England to establish the Protestant League in Germany against the Catholic states and the Holy Roman Emperor, making it one of the most influential states in its day. John Casimir died in 1592 without heirs, so Palatinate-Lautern was returned to the Palatinate.

John Casimir, Count Palatine of Lautern

John Casimir () (7 March 1543 – 16 January 1592) was the Count Palatine of Lautern from 1576 until 1593.
Life.
John Casimir was born in Simmern as the third son of Frederick III, Elector Palatine. In 1570 John Casimir was married to Elizabeth of Saxony, daughter of Duke Augustus and a granddaughter of King Christian III of Denmark. The marriage was purely political as Frederick wanted to spread Calvinism in Lutheran Saxony, and was unhappy. Elizabeth was placed under house arrest and was banned from walking outside in the sun. She eventually died in Kaiserslautern on 2 April 1590.
His father sent him to France in 1567 to assist the Huguenots. In March 1571 John Casimir moved to Kaiserslautern. In 1576 John Casimir was again sent to France. His father died that year and John Casimir succeeded him in his territories around Kaiserslautern. John Casimir was Calvinist like his father, but his elder brother Louis who succeeded as Elector Palatine was raised a Lutheran. Many theologians at the University of Heidelberg moved to Kaiserslautern, and in 1578 John Casimir founded the Collegium Casimirianum for them. Philip Sidney, an ambassador of Queen Elizabeth I of England, convinced John Casimir to begin the formation of a league of the Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire.

Palatinate-Lützelstein

Palatinate-Lützelstein was an ephemeral state of the Holy Roman Empire based around La Petite-Pierre (), located in the Vosges Mountains, in the present-day Bas-Rhin département of the Alsace region in northeastern France.
Lützelstein Castle, erected by the Counts of Blieskastel at a mountain pass to Lorraine, and the surrounding territory originally were a fief of the Bishopric of Strasbourg. Held by the elder House of Leiningen, who had accepted the suzerainty of the Electorate of the Palatinate, the lands were seized as a reverted fief by the mighty Wittelsbach Elector Palatine Frederick I upon the extinction of the Leiningen counts in 1462.
In the course of a 1553 re-arrangement of the Palatinate territories, Lützelstein was allotted to Count Palatine Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, who ceded the estates to his uncle Count Palatine Rupert of Veldenz. His son Count Palatine George John I of Veldenz founded the town of Phalsbourg ("Pfalzburg"), which he nevertheless was forced to pledge to Duke Charles III of Lorraine shortly afterwards.
Upon the death of Count Palatine George John I in 1592, Palatinate-Veldenz was administrated by his widow Princess Anna Maria of Sweden, until in 1598 her sons divided their heritage. Palatinate-Lützelstein was created for Count Palatine John Augustus, who had received the Alsacien territories around Lützelstein.
John Augustus himself died without issue in 1611 and was succeeded by his younger brother Count Palatine George John II of Guttenberg, who renamed the united state Palatinate-Lützelstein-Guttenberg. As he himself left no surviving children upon his death in 1654, his territory fell back to Palatinate-Veldenz.
With the Alsace region, the Lützelstein territory was annexed by France according to the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick following the Nine Years' War of the Palatinate Succession, and finally incorporated into the Bas-Rhin département in 1801.

Palatinate-Mosbach was a state of the Holy Roman Empire based around Mosbach and Eberbach in the north of modern Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
Palatinate-Mosbach was created in 1410 out of the partition of the Palatinate after the death of King Rupert III for his son Otto. In 1448 Otto inherited half of Palatinate-Neumarkt and purchased the other half, and renamed his state Palatinate-Mosbach-Neumarkt.

Life.
Otto was born in Mosbach in 1390 as the youngest son of Rupert III of the Palatinate, King of Germany. In 1410 after the death of his father, the territories of the Palatinate were divided between his four sons; Otto received the territory around Mosbach and Eberbach. He made Mosbach his capital and began the construction of a new residence there. Otto became the regent of the Electorate of the Palatinate and guardian of his nephew Louis IV after his brother Louis III returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem seriously ill and died soon after. He held the regency until 1442.
In 1448 he inherited half of the territory of the extinct Palatinate-Neumarkt line and purchased the other half from his brother Stephen, and he also established a residence in Neumarkt. Otto died in Reichenbach am Regen in 1461 and was buried in the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenbach.
Marriage.
Otto married Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (1413 - 20 July 1444), daughter of duke Henry XVI in January in 1430 and had the following children:

Living River Siam

Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; formerly South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a Thai non-governmental organization (NGO) which analyzes the impact of Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research of indigenous peoples to give Thai villagers the power to document the influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document the effects of the dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.
Pak Mun Dam protests.
Living River Siam was launched on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, by a group of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support an occupation of the Pak Mun Dam site by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly became the focus of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and was the focus of the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on an everyday basis.
On June 16, 2001, the Thai government under Thaksin Shinawatra agreed to open the sluice gates of the Pak Mun Dam for four months to allow studies to be conducted on its social impact; this was later extended to thirteen months. Coinciding with this agreement, the government announced that official studies would be conducted by Ubon Ratchathani University and a private team contracted by the National Economic and Social Development Board. The university received a budget of 10 million baht (roughly $280,000 USD), and the government contractors, alleged to be the same group that recommended damming another river, received 94 million baht (roughly $2,700,000 USD), raising suspicions. Villagers felt the outside academics would not be able to make an objective or accurate study of the river because they were unfamiliar with local fish migration and habitats.
Thai Baan research.
In response, Living River Siam developed "Ngan Wijai Thai Baan" (งานวิจัยไทบ้าน), or "research by Thai villagers". This sort of research is meant to circumvent the traditional approach to anthropological study by allowing villagers to investigate and document, with their own language and on their own terms, every aspect of their life on the river. The only function of the overseeing organization is to compile the villagers' data and publish it for others to read. Living River Siam refers to this in English as "Thai Baan research".
The Mun River research documented the spawning grounds, migration patterns, habitats, and preferred baits of 137 species of fish. Originally, there were 265 species in the river; 220 of these disappeared when the river was dammed, and only 92 reappeared when the sluice gates were opened, meaning that the diversity of the Mun ecosystem had already been severely reduced by the dam. There were 104 species that migrated between the Mekong and Mun rivers, meaning the dam endangered the Mekong's ecosystem as well. Thai villagers took photos of all of the fish and counted the number of fish caught before and after the opening of the gates. Over 200 villagers volunteered for the study, and divided themselves up into groups to survey the sub-ecosystems of rapids, channels, eddies, small waterfalls, drinking wells, "don" islands, "bok hin" pools, "khum" pools, "wang" pools, "huu" holes, "lhum hin" stone pockets, "kon" shallows, "kan" underwater rapids, and "luang" fishing grounds.
The use of small and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. Researchers found that while the less common large fish are sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers consisted mostly of small fish which can be caught in both the wet and dry seasons. Small fish are eaten, sold for money, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.
The villages documented changes in their towns as a result of the opening of the sluice gates. Fishermen who had been forced to leave for the city returned to their homes, the increase in fish caused a boom in the rural economy, in fishing and tourism. Villagers were able to hold religious ceremonies in important riverside spaces.
Government reaction and other responses.
The results of the Thai Baan research were supported by several academics, including Niti Pawakapan of Chulalongkorn University. The Ubon Ratchathani University study also recommended keeping the sluice gates open for at least five years. However, the Thai government rejected all of the studies for unclear reasons and instead conducted a three-day opinion poll of a random sample of Thais, after which it decided that the gates would stay closed for eight out of twelve months of the year. In 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont decided to close the gates permanently, citing an alleged secret agreement between thousands of villagers and the Internal Security Operations Command.
The response from non-governmental organizations has been more favorable. The Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), an international alliance managed by the United Nations Development Programme and World Conservation Union, has published a study on the methodology of Thai Baan research and coordinated their own study in Sri Songkham district in 2004, concluding that it was more useful than top-down styles of village research. The study overseen by the MWBP was cited in an academic journal and submitted to an international conference. Living River Siam's spokesperson Pianporn Deetes was invited to a United Nations Environment Programme conference on dams.
In 2002 the Thai government’s department of irrigation met the demands of Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with a promise to halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with cautious optimism. To circumvent the issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced plans to build a series of dams on Burma's Salween River along its border with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son province.
Additional research.
Since 2004, Living River Siam has employed its research methods in other threatened locations across rural Thailand.
Amphoe Chiang Khong.
The Mekong River remained free of dams until 1993 because of its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course of some of its branches. In 2004, the Thai government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which Thai Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional Thai Baan surveys from 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the blasting of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the Thai government suspended blasting on one of the rapids, the Khon Pi Luang.
Kaeng Sua Ten.
In 2006, in response to renewed plans for dam construction in Kaeng Sua Ten, Living River Siam released a report on the people of Sa-iap, Amphoe Song, Phrae Province (part of Mae Yom National Park), based on their own experiences and history. It was called Chaobaan research, but the methodology was equivalent to the Thai Baan research. The report examined the ecosystem of the residents of Sa-iap, the vegetables and fungi they subsisted on, medicinal herbs they used, local fauna, wood resources, and their culture.
The report divided Sa-iap history into four periods. Before 1937, the village was self-sustaining and used both farming and gathering for the overwhelming majority of its needs. In 1937, the Thai government allowed private companies to log the forest, destroying part of the villages' infrastructure. In 1957, the villagers entered the employ of the logging companies, causing internal and external conflict as well as increased reliance on unsustainable practices. Finally, in 1991 the villagers formed a conservation group, the Forest Lover Group, which the Chaobaan researchers agreed cut down on conflict. The mood of the villages has returned to one of mutual assistance and traditional customs.
Rasi Salai Dam.
The Rasi Salai Dam was completed in 1994, around the same time as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.
Mekong flooding.
In 2005, and again in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, damaging hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as the primary cause of the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams had little to do with the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.
Seminars, coordination, and publications.
Beginning in 2006, Living River Siam began training other grassroots organizations in Thai Baan research, beginning with the Vietnam Rivers Network and expanding to a Chinese group in 2007. In 2008 they worked with the Burma Rivers Network to conduct research on the Salween River. They also assisted a United Nations-funded NGO, the Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), with running Thai Baan research in 2004. Living River Siam, along with the MWBP, organizes cross-basin coordination between Thai Baan research groups.
Living River Siam has compiled the research and oral accounts of Thai villagers into many publications, which they make available on their website. Its published books document local knowledge about fish, the results of village research, a how-to manual for Thai Baan research, and citizens' guides to defending Thai rivers and communities. They also have produced posters of fish species and dams, pamphlets on fishing gear, and short documentaries about the river.

Otto II, Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt

Otto II Mathematicus (26 June 1435 – 8 June 1499) was the Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt from 1461 until 1499.
Life.
Otto was born in 1435 as the eldest son of Otto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt. He succeeded his father in 1461 and spent most of his life in Neumarkt. He managed to end the controversy of Wolfstein, a castle and city opposite Neumarkt with the same rights which was ruled by the House of Wolfstein, after acquiring the pawned castle from the Neuschönenbergs. Otto II also had a strong interest in astronomy and mathematics, which led to his title "Mathematicus", and he established an observatory on the castle at Neumarkt. In 1490 he retired all active rulership over Mosbach-Neumarkt to Philip, Elector Palatine, and spent the remainder of his life in scientific pursuits.
Otto died in Neumarkt in 1499 childless and was buried in the Church of St Maria. Mosbach-Neumarkt passed to the Electoral Palatinate after his death.

Ray Johnston

Raymond "Ray" Stephen Johnston (born 5 May 1981, in Bristol, England) is an English football goalkeeper most recently with Tiverton Town.
Johnston started his career as a youth team player for Bristol Rovers, where he eventually signed professional terms in 1998. Despite being a former England schoolboy international, Johnston could only manage to appear in one league game with The Pirates, a 4-3 victory against Macclesfield Town in 1999.
He joined Bath City in 2002, appearing in 6 games. He was the backup to first choice keeper Mark Hervin. An injury at the start of the 2003 season left Johnston 3rd choice so he chose transfer to Bishop Sutton.
Along the way, Johnston found small roles with Weston-super-Mare and Frome Town.
Ray joined Clevedon Town at the start of the 2005 season and played in 41 league games for them, appearing in an additional 9 cup games. While Johnston was the first choice keeper for Clevedon, he led them to promotion to the Southern Football League Premier Division. He was inexplicably released before the start of the next season.
Johnston found his way back to Frome Town in October 2006, but was once again out the door before the season was over in 2007. It was reported that Gloucester City put in a seven day's notice for him on 29 January 2007 and he joined up with The Tigers soon after. His debut with Gloucester came on 3 February 2007.
Eventually Johnston found himself at Tiverton Town, but was released by manager Martyn Rogers upon the signing of Steve Book and Johnston's inability to fully recover from an Achilles tendon tear and ankle problems.
In 2011 Johnston became manager of Toolstation Western League Division One side Portishead Town.
At the beginning of the 2012-2013, Johnston took over as manager of Wells City FC, in the Toolstation Western League Premier Division.

Cortinarius triumphans

Cortinarius triumphans, also known as the birch webcap, or yellow girdled webcap is a basidiomycete mushroom of the genus "Cortinarius" found in Europe. It is regarded as edible by some authorities, although others call it suspect and it resembles inedible species.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838; its generic name derived from the Latin "cortina" "veil", and the specific "triumphans" "triumphing". It is considered the same species as "Cortinarius crocolitus" Quélet by some authorities. It is a member of the subgenus "Phlegmacium" within the genus "Cortinarius"; mushrooms of this group have sticky (or slimy in wet weather) caps and dry stipes.
Description.
It has a 5–12 cm (2–5 in) diameter cap which is yellowish in colour-darker in the centre and paler on the edges. The stipe is 7–17 cm (3–7 in) high and 1–2.5 cm (0.4–1 in) thick and swollen at the base, and is white up top and yellow lower down and bears the tan or brown remnants of the veil. The adnate gills, which are hidden by a cream or white veil when young, are cream or lilac early on, and darken with the spores, which give a rusty coloured spore print. The almond-shaped spores measure 10–12.5 × 5.5–7 µm. The flesh is cream-coloured and the taste mild.
Distribution and habitat.
"Cortinarius triumphans" appears under birch trees in autumn (fall) in Europe, and Asia where it is widespread, but local. It is also reported from north eastern North America. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with birch trees ("Betula").
Edibility.
Although some mushroom guides list it as edible, others treat it with suspicion, as many webcaps have been found to have toxins, not in the least the similarly brown-coloured lethal webcaps. This being the case, it is probably best to avoid it. Thomas Laessoe's 1998 book 'Mushrooms', describes the taste as bitter, with a not unpleasant smell.

Alexander of Cyprus

Alexander of Cyprus or Alexander Cyprius, perhaps also known as Alexander the Monk or Alexander Monachus, was apparently a 6th-century Cypriot monk active in the cloister near the sanctuary of St. Barnabas in Salaminia or Constantina. He also had as one of his aims the authentication of the ecclesiastical independence of Cyprus.
Date and Work.
Alexander seems to have lived any time between the mid-6th century and the 9th century. The Byzantinist Alexander Kazhdan roundly argued that the traditional view of placing him in the mid-6th century was not necessarily valid. Cyril Mango and John W. Nesbitt maintain that he was a 6th-century author, according to his literary interests.
He composed a treatise called "on the finding of the cross" (de inventatione sanctae crucis), covering the history of Christianity from the emperor Tiberius to the discovery of the cross by Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great. There is also a Georgian version of this work.
Identification.
Nothing is known about the life of Alexander. Some scholars identify him with Alexander the Monk, the author of an enkomion of the apostle Barnabas: but Kazhdan views this identification as arbitrary.

John E. Connelly

John Edward Connelly (August 1926-May 16, 2009) founded the Gateway Clipper Fleet in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pioneered riverboat casino gambling along the Mississippi River via his President Casinos empire, and founded a fleet of ships operating out of Chelsea Piers in New York City.
Early life.
Connelly was born in Pennsylvania. His parents died when he was 16. He was a coal miner and edited a newspaper at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1940s he was a Congressional assistant for Congressman Harry J. Davenport.
Pittsburgh businesses.
Incentive marketing.
In the early 1950s he founded J. Edward Connelly in Pittsburgh, which pioneered the concept of incentive marketing, or giving away products at banks and super markets in order to attract business. He was called the father of the practice and was called to testify before Congress after merchants complained it was an unfair practice.
Gateway Clipper.
While being treasurer of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority which was cleaning up Pittsburgh rivers he came up with concept of starting excursion boats to show that the rivers around Pittsburgh had been cleaned up. In 1958 he started the Gateway Clipper Fleet.
He acquired the Sheraton Hotel at Station Square in 1981.
In 1971 he was the Democratic nominee in a race to replace Representative Robert Corbett who had died in office. He lost to John Heinz.
Riverboat Expansion.
Chelsea Piers in New York City.
In 1983 Connelly acquired control of World Yacht, a dinner cruise company in New York City founded by Neil Heap and Peter Simonetta in 1969. Connelly got access to three berths in the Chelsea Piers and was instrumental in its redevelopment. He expanded the fleet to three boats. In 1988 World Yacht was purchased by Circle Line for $35 Million.
St. Louis, Missouri.
In 1981 he acquired the largest excursion ship plying the Mississippi River -- the SS Admiral in St. Louis, Missouri from Streckfus Steamers. He sold it to investors in 1982. He began managing it again in 1988 and reacquired it in 1990.
He also acquired the excursion boats Huck Finn and Becky Thacher as well as the Robert E. Lee floating restaurant. All of the boats formed a steamship row docked at the foot of the Gateway Arch.
President Casinos.
In 1990 he acquired the "President" which was on the National Register of Historic Places in Davenport, Iowa. He also acquired the Blackhawk Hotel in downtown Davenport which is also on the National Register.
Iowa was the first state to legalize riverboat gambling in modern times and the President became one of the first casinos to open.
In 1992 he acquired the President Casino Broadwater Resort in Biloxi, Mississippi. It was the second casino on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi.
In 1992 he formed President Casinos.
In 1993 he converted the Admiral in St. Louis to be one of the first casinos in Missouri after that state legalized gambling.
As a pioneer in gambling in three states, stock soared. He held one third of the company stock and he was worth $107 million. His total net worth of $370 million had him on the Forbes list of richest Americans. He entered the bidding to bring an expansion team to St. Louis after the St. Louis football Cardinals left the city.
However the stock soon plummeted as Illinois legalized riverboat gambling and more casino competition arose. Further complicating matters the Great Flood of 1993 forced the lengthy closure of the casinos. By 1996 his share of stock was valued at $14.7 million. He cut the pledge to $7 million and received a contract to exclusively sell reproductions of Vatican art in the United States. However the deal was eventually halted after he could not market the art beyond Pittsburgh.
His Mississippi efforts were challenged by Jack E. Pratt of the Pratt Hotel Corporation which said it had the rights to develop the Broadwater Resort. Although the case was dismissed Connelly paid out $1 million. He sold the Iowa casino after Illinois legalized gambling on its side of the river.
In 1993 it entered into an agreement with the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Tribe to develop a landbased casino in the Catskill Mountains in New York. It would lose $4.1 million on the project which was never built.
It entered into a planned casino in Gary, Indiana which fell through. It lost $11 million when a proposed casino in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania fell through. In 1995 it closed its money losing casino in Tunica, Mississippi. The company pitched a casino plying the waters of New York City which never materialized.
The company ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002 and has now divested itself of all its gambling operations.
Competency hearing.
In 2006 he was the subject of a family battle with his adoptive daughter Audree Wirginis to wrest control of the company on the basis competence. He was ultimately removed as chairman of his companies.
Philanthropies.
In the early 1990s he pledged $13 million of the $20 million required to build the Domus Sanctae Marthae, a hotel at the Vatican where cardinals and other dignitaries would stay on visits to the Vatican (and where they stay during elections of Popes). When he made the pledge his shares of President Casinos were worth $107 million but by 1996 his share of stock was valued at $14.7 million. He cut the pledge to $7 million and received a contract to exclusively sell reproductions of Vatican art in the United States. However the deal was eventually halted after he could not market the art beyond Pittsburgh.
His donations to Saint Louis University resulted in the school renaming the main dividing street for the campus from "West Pine Mall Boulevard" to "John E. Connelly Mall".

Cervicography

Cervicography is a diagnostic medical procedure in which a non-physician takes pictures of the cervix and submits them to a physician for interpretation. Other related procedures are speculoscopy and colposcopy. The procedure is considered a screening test for cervical cancer and is complementary to Pap smear. The technique was initially developed by Adolf Stafl, MD, of Medical College of Wisconsin in 1981.
Unlike colposcopy, cervicography does not have a current CPT/HCPCS code and typically is not covered by most medical insurance companies. (Cervicography was given a Category III CPT code of 0003T, but this was discontinued in 2006.)
Cervicography is no more sensitive than Pap smear screening, and has a higher false positive rate (thus increasing the number of colposcopies needed).
Whether cervicography could have a role in countries where Pap smear screening programs are not in place depends on cost effectiveness and remained to be determined as of 1998. A 2005 study found the sensitivity and specificity of cervicography for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to be 72.3% and 93.2% respectively; however, a 2007 study criticized the sensitivity figure as "likely... inflated" because the "gold standard" of colposcopy/biopsy may have missed cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

In 1563 he married Anne of Sweden, the daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden, beginning a long-running connection between the Electorate of the Palatinate and Sweden. In 1553 after the Heidelberg War of Succession which regulated the mutual inheritance of all the lines of the House of Wittelsbach, George John obtained the County of Lützelstein. He attempted to develop his Alsatian territories to be the focus of his state, which led to him building the city of Phalsbourg (Pfalzburg) in 1570 and populating it with Protestant refugeees from the Duchy of Lorraine. The project was so grand and unaffordable that in 1583 he was forced to sell the city and half the County of Lützelstein to Lorraine.

Ricardo Martínez de Hoyos

Ricardo Martínez de Hoyos (b. October 28, 1918 - d. January 11, 2009) was a Mexican painter noted for his figurative work on unreal atmospheres. He was one of several children from a very large family to make a mark in his field, along with Oliverio in sculpture and Jorge in acting. His work was exhibited in various parts of the world, featured in collective tours of Mexican art. Individually, he exhibited mostly in Mexico including important venues such as the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Palacio de Bellas Artes, which held a tribute to the artist in 1994. Since his death, a cultural center named after him has been established in the historic center of Mexico City.
Life.
Martínez was born on Calle de Madrid, near Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City. He was the thirteenth of sixteen children born to Nester Martínez Perales from Nuevo León and Elena de Hoyos de la Garz from Coahuila. Several of his brothers became notable: Oliverio for sculpture, Enrico and Homero in architecture and Jorge became a known actor.
In 1925, he began his education at the Alberto Correa primary school, but three years later, the family went to live in San Antonio, Texas, where his mother had relatives.(foundacion) The family remained for four years, returning to Mexico in 1932 because of the Great Depression . This experience made Martínez learn English fluently and a fan of works by authors Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, William Faulkner, John Dos Passos and Walt Whitman . He returned to school in Mexico, attending Orientación middle school in 1935 then graduating to the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria in 1938. In 1939 he founded a group called the Amigos de la Conservación de los Frescos de José Clemente Orozco in high school to protect the school’s murals from vandalism. To please his parents, Martínez then went to study law at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México but dropped out months later to pursue painting. He then registered to enter the Academy of San Carlos, but lasted only a day as he did not like its norms and values.
Martínez began to draw early in his childhood. From 1934 to 1935, he older brother Oliverio was hired as a sculptor to work on the Monumento a la Revolución. Ricardo accompanied him, keeping busy creating drawings, which Oliverio would then show proudly to his colleagues. Oliverio taught the basics of painting to Ricardo who produced his first in 1939. Shortly after this Oliverio died of an illness. Except for a course at the Galería de Arte Mexicano, Martínez is a self-taught painter, using art books with the works of European and Mexican masters as a guide, including a 1934 book in English called “The materials of the artist Max Doerner” . 
Martínez had a reputation for being introverted and modest, even reclusive, which he denied. However, despite this, Martínez had many friends and connections not only in the art world but in the political one as well. While visiting his brother on the Monumento project, he met sculptor Francisco Zúñiga and later he met Juan Soriano through gallery owner Inés Amor, who stated that Soriano did all the talking in that friendship. His main political connections were through two fellow students from law school Luis Echeverría Alvarez and José López Portillo, both of whom went on to become president of Mexico. Both were also supportive of Martínez’s decision to move into painting. Echeverría gave him money from that destined to buy a suit, so that Martínez could buy his first oils. When Martínez needed a base to grind pigments, López Portillo took apart a French bureau from his family’s home to donate the marble top. Martín conserved that top for the rest of his life. However, despite this strong friendship with the two, Martínez never visited Los Pinos, the Mexican presidential residence.
After he began his art career, he established his first studio in his family’s home in 1940. In 1943, he moved to a new studio in Colonia Anzures, becoming the neighbor and friend of Federico Cantú. He built his final studio on Calle de Etna, living and working there for the rest of his life.
In 1969 he traveled to Europe visiting England, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, visiting museums. Another of his influences, pre Hispanic sculpture, was represented in his home with a collection of 300 artifacts.
Martínez met his wife Zarina Lacy at the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico and they married in 1949. The couple had two children Pablo, now the head of the Ricado Martínez Foundation and Zarina, who lives in Paris.
Martínez died of cardiac and respiratory arrest, while hospitalized with pneumonia at the age of eighty.
Career.
Martínez began his art career in 1940 and worked until his death, leaving a number of unfinished works. His work was exhibited in various locations in Mexico as well as abroad. Most of his individual exhibitions were in Mexico City, with others in the United States and Brazil. He had his first exhibition in Guadalajara in 1944, organized by María Asúnsolo, a known supporter of the arts. In break into the Mexico City market, Martínez compiled a series of oils, tempera and drawings for the Galería de Arte Mexicano directed by Inés Amor. He then showed with this gallery frequently in his early career (1944, 1945, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1964), the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center (1948-1949) along with the Galería de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City (1956), The Contemporaries in New York (1959, 1960, 1961, 1964), the Phoenix Art Museum (1966), the Sindin Gallery in New York (1976) and Club de Banqueros de México in Mexico City (2000), as well as prestigious showings at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1969 and 1974 and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1984 and 1994. The 1994 show was an anthology of is work as well as a national event to honor the artist. His work featured prominently in collective exhibitions of Mexican art in countries such as the United States, Guatemala, Sweden, Peru, Great Britain, Argentina, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Poland and El Salvador. One major collective exhibition was “Masterpieces of Mexican Art” which toured the United States and Europe from 1961 to 1963.
His works can be found in public and private collections around the world. In Mexico, his works are part of the collections of the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Bancomer Foundation, the Galería de Arte Moderno and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. One collection abroad with a work is that of the Vatican, given as a gift to Pope Paul IV by then Mexican president Echeverría.
In addition to painting, Martínez illustrated books, mostly by writer friends. These include Muerte sin fin by José Gorostiza, Junta de sombras by Alfonso Reyes, Poemas mexicanos by Francisco Giner de los Ríos, Epigrama Americanos by Enrique Díez Canedo, Juego de pobres by José Bonifaz Nuño and Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo . His work has been published in thirty four books both before and after his death. He created the sets for the dance piece Xochipili Macuilxoxohitl by Carlos Chavez in 1948, when he began teaching classes in painting at the Fine Arts Center in Colorado Spring. He then taught in San Diego and then back in Mexico City, counting artists such as Lucinda Urrusti, Susan Sollins, and Gerardo López Bonilla among his students. 
Martínez’s first recognition for his work was the Raúl Beillers Prize in 1967, followed by the Moinho Santista Prize at the Sao Paulo Biennial in 1971. He was named a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana In 1993, the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes named him an Artist Emeritus and his had a major retrospective and homage at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1994. In 2008, the Mexican capital awarded him the Medalla de la Ciudad de México and named him a distinguished citizen. After his death, there was a retrospective of his work at the Museo de la Ciudad de México in 2012, the same year that the Ricardo Martínez Cultural Center was established in the former Variedades cinema on Avenida Juárez in the historic center of Mexico City.
Artistry.
Martínez was a figurative painter, who incorporation the various artistic tendencies that existed during his lifetime, but was not a follower of any.
Because Martínez was self-demanding and not anxious to begin showing his work, he took time to develop his techniques in color and composition, giving his early works maturity. These works were still lifes, landscapes, and depictions of indigenous people and children, often with nationalistic elements. This shows the influence of Mexican muralism, mostly through his associations with Juan Soriano, Jesús Guerrero Galván and later Federico Cantú. 
However, Martínez never copied the style of the muralists and early began experimenting with different techniques such as tempera, gouache and watercolors, as well as stylistic elements from Surrealism and non-narrative figurative works. This moved him into the category of the Generación de la Ruptura although he never openly opposed the work of the Mexican muralism movement.
His work from the 1940s into the 1950s, shows influence from surrealism. By the end of the 1960s, his worked was characterized by the inclusion of unreal atmospheres which consisted of interplay of light and color concentrations. His figures show influence from pre Hispanic art, especially figures, simplifying them and giving them a sculpted quality. These figures were often oversized and or sensual nudes.
His years of pictoral research of the European masters gave him significant technical mastery, and a knowledge of space in which large monochrome or bichrome zones gave his form a monumental feel, with volumes interacting with light and shade in an abstract manner. In some works, light seems to originate from the background and in others light is employed to illuminate faces and accent sublime emotions.

Midtown Farmers' Market

The Midtown Farmers Market is a seasonal open-air farmers market in the Midtown area of south Minneapolis. Established in 2003, the market is held Saturdays from May through October, and Tuesdays from June through October in a parking lot in the Corcoran neighborhood. The market is a project of the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization, and is known for a selection of locally-produced and organic fare. All of the products sold at the market are grown or produced in Minnesota or Wisconsin by the individual vendors. At the peak of the season, the Saturday market hosts over 70 vendors and draws over 60,000 shoppers each season. 
In addition to the usual cash, shoppers can also pay using credit cards or EBT (food stamp) cards. Customers wishing to use these alternative forms of payment use credit card processing machines at a central booth to buy wooden tokens, which can be spent as cash throughout the market. The Midtown Farmers Market was the first in Minnesota to offer an EBT payment option. 
Mission.
The mission of the Midtown Farmers Market is to create a vibrant forum in south Minneapolis that connects community residents and nearby rural food producers in a mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchange.
History and location.
Since 2003, the Midtown Farmers Market (MFM) has connected locally produced food and goods with 40,000 customers per season at 2225 East Lake Street on a surface parking lot owned by Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS). The Midtown Farmers Market was conceived by local residents and is operated by the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization (CNO). The Midtown Farmers Market was a key element of the Corcoran Midtown Revival Plan. The MFM currently operates one day a week from May to June, and two days a week from June through October.
The market site offers parking and bicycle racks. The Lake Street Station of the METRO Blue Line is immediately adjacent to the market site, and several Metro Transit bus routes stop near the site. 
The market was awarded the title of "Best Farmers Market" by "City Pages" in 2004.
Preserving the Midtown Farmers Market.
The Midtown Farmers Market was a key element of the Corcoran Midtown Revival Plan, which called for a mix of housing, retail/office, structured/underground parking, and public open space. This citizen-generated Plan was adopted by the City Council as part of the Minneapolis Plan in 2002.
Given development pressures and the pending sale of the 6-1/2 acre site by the school district, residents look forward to the opportunity to realize the Plan and create a permanent home for the Midtown Farmers Market at 2225 East Lake on a public square, plaza, or mall shared within a larger mixed-use, transit oriented development adjacent to the Lake Street LRT station, with nearby connections to the Midtown Greenway bikeway, bus transit, and a proposed Midtown Greenway trolley line.
The Midtown Farmers Market is secure at 2225 East Lake Street—its home of 7 seasons—and will be part of the future redevelopment of the site. This was the message from Mark Bollinger, Executive Director of Facilities for Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), when he attended the April 19, 2010 meeting of Corcoran’s Land Use and Transportation and Housing committees. MPS owns the building and 6-1/2 acre site and is currently preparing a request for proposals (RFP) for its sale and redevelopment.

Of Mice and Men (play)

Of Mice and Men is a play adapted from John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name. The play, which predates the Tony Awards and the Drama Desk Awards, earned the 1938 New York Drama Critics' Circle Best Play. Its revivals failed to earn Tony or Drama Desk recognition.
Background.
The 1937 production opened while the novel was still on best seller lists. At the time, George S. Kaufman was the top director in the country.
Plot.
George, an affable migrant farm worker, and Lennie, a towering simple-minded pleasantly humble young man, are the subjects. They are bound by George's devotion and Lennie's "pathetic helplessness". George's guardianship keeps Lennie out of trouble, but we soon see this is a slippery slope. Lennie's displays of love result in several deaths ranging from mice and puppies to a beautiful woman. Eventually, in the face of a lynch mob, George kills Lennie to put him out of his misery.
Productions.
Steinbeck adapted the play from the novel.
The play had its world premiere circa October 1937 by the San Francisco Theatre Union The play premiered on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre on November 23, 1937 and closed in May 1938 after 207 performances. Directed by George S. Kaufman, the cast starred Broderick Crawford as Lennie and Wallace Ford as George. In 1939 the production was moved to Los Angeles, still with Wallace Ford in the role of George, but with Lon Chaney, Jr., taking on the role of Lennie. Chaney's performance in the role resulted in his casting in the movie.
There have been several revivals, with another Broadway revival scheduled for 2014, directed by Anna D. Shapiro with James Franco (George), Chris O'Dowd (Lennie)and Leighton Meester (Curley’s Wife).
Historical casting.
The following tables show the casts of the principal original productions:
Awards.
The production was chosen as Best Play in 1938 by the New York Drama Critics' Circle. The 2014 production earned two Tony Award nominations at the 68th Tony Awards (O'Dowd - Leading Actor and Japhy Weideman - Lighting Design).
Critical review.
Brooks Atkinson of "The New York Times" wrote "...Steinbeck has caught on paper two odd and lovable farm vagrants whose fate is implicit in their characters."

Pisharikavu

Pisharikavu Temple is a temple located at Koyilandy, Kozhikode district, Kerala, India
Myth about the temple.
Centuries before remaining members of the "Ettuveettil" family after conspiracy against Marthanda verma settled down in the village named Kollam near present day Koilandy in Calicut district. They were rich diamond merchants. One of family member prayed and did tapas to please goddess Badhra Kali. One night the goddess Sri Porkali (the family goddess of Ettuveettil pilla's) appeared in his dream and gave him a very special sword named "Nandhakam" and told him to pray her in the form of this sword and she will answer all his prayers and also asked him to go to his home town. He went back to his hometown and built a temple and started worshiping the Nandakkam sword. The family by the grace of mother Badhra Kali became very rich and powerful. They paid Samoothiri-King of kozhikode and brought a land there and settled down there with their family and built a beautiful temple here and worshiped the Nandakkam sword, it is believed that 8 family have migrated from south, namely Kiziyil, Vazhayil, Elayedathu, Echarathil, Punathil, Nanothu, Mundakil, Erothu. Native people called them "vyapari"(merchants) at that time. Later name changed to "Ravari" in colloquial language. The community is existing even now and they have special rights for conducting festival called "Kaliyattam".

Scrapbook (album)

Scrapbook is an album by American jazz bassist and composer William Parker's Violin Trio featuring Billy Bang which was recorded in 2002 and released on the Thirsty Ear label.
Reception.
In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states "This is a restrained and lovely album that possesses real firepower in places, but it's almost never necessary because the level of communication runs so deep between these players that everything feels light as a breeze, poignant as a memory, and as fresh as a wound" "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" observed "There is plenty of open improvisation to be found but it's the structure of these six songs that is intriguing".
The All About Jazz review said the album "combines the raw sounds of the blues, spirituals, and funk with a keen sense of adventurous experimentation". JazzTimes enthused "This CD can easily sit alongside Parker's recent and equally brilliant quartet recording, "O'Neal's Porch.".

Astrological Straits

Astrological Straits is the debut full-length studio album by American recording artist Zach Hill. It was released on August 12, 2008 by Anticon and Ipecac Records.
Critical reception.
"Astrological Straits" has received generally favorable reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album received a metascore of 72, based on six reviews. Michael Patrick Brady of The Phoenix called the album an "unrestrained torrent of challenging yet tuneful rock" and pointed out that this album served as an outlet for Hill's "abstract ideas". Marc Masters of Pitchfork Media found that Hill's drumming dominated the album. He compared the sound to the work of Liars, Boredoms, Lightning Bolt and Frank Zappa while comparing his vocals on the track "Hindsight Is Nowhere" to those of Angus Andrew, vocalist of Liars. John Bohannon of PopMatters complimented the melodies on the album while he criticized the "bombardment of snare drum and obnoxious electronic tones" as well as the choice of including Les Claypool in the album. Nick Greer of Sputnikmusic called Hill's drumming "virtuostic, strange, and interesting" while describing his vocals as compressed and monotonous. He compared the guitar sounds on the album to those of Hella's Spencer Seim's work with added "strange slides and electronic, microtonal blurs". Greer appreciated the more pop-driven songs to more experimental ones and called parts of the album "nearly unlistenable".

Be Like That

"Be Like That" is the title of a song recorded by the American post-grunge band 3 Doors Down. It was released in June 2001 as the fourth single from the album, "The Better Life". It peaked at #24 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. for the week ending November 10, 2001. A version of the song with minor lyrical changes was made, for the movie "American Pie 2", and was featured on the movie's soundtrack.
Music video.
A video was also made for this version directed by Liz Friedlander.
Content.
"This song," says 3DD lead singer Brad Arnold, "was strange, because I wrote the verses and the choruses at two completely different times. And I couldn't think of the verse for the chorus, or the chorus for the verse." Until one night driving home from band practice, the singer had an epiphany, "and I was sitting in my car singing, and I put those two together, and I was like, Duh. And I went home and just got a three chord structure going for the melody of it, and took it to practice the next day, and I asked Chris to make something out of it, and he came back the next day and he had it, and it just went from there."
Arnold confesses to having no ability to play guitar, so when he writes a song, it's more like "chicken pecking" notes, and it can be a long process. According to Arnold, this song is about following your dreams. "And I know everybody has 'em. It's not also just about following your dreams, though. It's kind of a little bit about dreams that you've missed, and a little notion of regret, also."
The person in the first verse of the song is fictional, and Arnold left it open to interpretation on whether that person is older or younger. He explains: "It's just kind of an idea. And it's kind of weird. Maybe it doesn't have a perfect string full of lyrics in that first verse, and for me I've never thought it had a perfect one, because it's almost suggesting that it's an older person, but in a lot of ways it's kind of suggesting it's a younger person. But I left it like that because I want things to be like that. I want it to be like it would be interpreted a lot of different ways. I don't do it so much anymore, but I used to think that when I write lyrics, I tried to do every line to where it could be taken more than one way. And my thought process behind that was, Well, if I can get two meanings out of it, then there are countless meanings out there for somebody else to apply it to their own life."
He also offers this bit of philosophy: "The difference in a good song and a great song, to me, is the difference in a good book and a good movie: They're both telling you the same story. They both have the same outcome. But whereas the movie is telling you exactly what to see and be heard, the book kind of lets you see whatever your mind comes up with, and it makes it a lot more applicable to your life in a lot of ways."

Jack Bradley (footballer)

John "Jack" Bradley (27 November 1916 – 14 December 2002) was an English footballer who played as an inside forward for various clubs in the 1930s and 1940s, including Swindon Town, Southampton and Bolton Wanderers.
Playing career.
Bradley was born in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire and, after playing youth football with South Kirkby Colliery, he joined Huddersfield Town in November 1935. He did not make any first team appearances for Huddersfield, and in August 1936 he was transferred to Swindon Town of the Third Division South.
Bradley spent two seasons with Swindon, making 25 league appearances in which he scored six goals. In the FA Cup he scored twice in a 6–0 victory over Dulwich Hamlet in the First Round on 28 November 1936. The following season, he went one better scoring a hat trick (including two penalties) in a 4–3 win over Gillingham on 27 November 1937, his 21st birthday.
In June 1938, he moved to Chelsea but again made no first team appearances before being transferred to Southampton in May 1939.
Southampton.
He joined Southampton in readiness for the 1939–40 season, but had not broken into the first team before League football was abandoned following the outbreak of the Second World War. At the start of the war, he joined the Police War Reserve and remained in Southampton, playing in the Football League South war leagues. 
In 1940, Bradley joined the Royal Air Force and his postings took him all over England. During the war he guested for several clubs, including Reading, Luton Town, Blackpool, Millwall, Aldershot, Rotherham United, Hereford United and Rochdale.
He returned to The Dell in 1945 and was soon scoring regularly in the League South in 1945–46, with 14 goals from 25 league appearances, plus two in the FA Cup. According to Holley & Chalk, Bradley was "big and strong, (with) a powerful left foot that he put to good use during his short spell with the Saints".
On the resumption of League football in 1946, Bradley became the established inside left, with either Doug McGibbon or George Lewis at centre-forward. The outside left position was filled in turn by Bobby Veck, Wilf Grant and Eric Day as manager Bill Dodgin was assembling a team to try to gain promotion from the Second Division. Bradley finished his first League season with the "Saints" as joint top-scorer (with George Lewis) on 15 goals, as Southampton finished a lowly 14th.
In June 1947, the Saints went to Germany where they played a "Liberation Day" match against a local side. During this tour, Bradley's drinking upset manager Dodgin; Bradley in turn complained that Dodgin's coaching methods, involving the use of a blackboard, were ""too fussy"". Although Bradley started the 1947–48 season in blistering form, scoring in each of the opening five matches with seven goals in all, Dodgin could not forgive what he saw as a serious flouting of club discipline and in October Bradley was transferred to Bolton Wanderers for a fee of £8000, plus Billy Wrigglesworth coming in the opposite direction.
Bolton Wanderers.
At Burnden Park he finally got his chance to play in the First Division. He soon became established at inside left, alongside future international players such as Nat Lofthouse, Malcolm Barrass and Willie Moir. Despite this array of talent, Bolton struggled in the First Division, finishing each of Bradley's three seasons in the lower half of the table. 
Speaking in 1996, Lofthouse remembered his former team-mate: ""By God! Jack Bradley had the best left foot I've ever seen in my life"."
By November 1950, Bradley had lost his place to Harry Webster and was transferred to Norwich City, where he made only six appearances over the next two seasons before dropping out of the Football League.
Coaching with Great Yarmouth Town.
In July 1952, Bradley took up the post of player-manager of Great Yarmouth Town of the Eastern Counties League. Whilst the "Bloaters" achieved little in the league under Bradley's management, finishing fifth in his first two seasons, they had some success in the FA Cup.
In 1952–53, Great Yarmouth reached the Second Round proper for the first time ever, where they were defeated 2–1 by Wrexham. The following season, Great Yarmouth pulled off a giant-killing act, by defeating Crystal Palace of the Third Division South 1–0, with the goal being scored by Derrick Rackham in the sixth minute, before going out to Barrow in the Second Round.
After football.
Bradley resigned from the managerial post at Great Yarmouth in 1955, but remained in Norfolk, becoming the licencee of the Jolly Farmers pub in the village of Ormesby St Margaret near Great Yarmouth where he remained for 27 years.
Following his death in 2002, his ashes were scattered on the Great Yarmouth pitch at The Wellesley Recreation Ground.
Family.
Jack's father, Martin (1886–1958) played at inside forward for Grimsby Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol Rovers between 1907 and 1914.
His uncle was James Bradley (1881–1954), who was a member of Liverpool's Championship winning side of 1905–06 and also played for Stoke in the 1890s.

Church of the Holy Apostles, Athens

The Church of the Holy Apostles, also known as Holy Apostles of Solaki () or Agii Apostoli (), is located in the Ancient Agora of Athens, Greece, and can be dated to around the late 10th century.
History.
"Solakis" may be the family name of those who sponsored a later renovation of the church, or from "Solaki" for the densely populated area around the church in the 19th century.
The church is particularly significant as the only monument in the Agora, other than the Temple of Hephaestus, to survive intact since its foundation, and for its architecture: it was the first significant church of the middle Byzantine period in Athens, and marks the beginning of the so-called "Athenian type", successfully combining the simple four-pier with the cross-in-square forms. The church was built partly over a 2nd-century "nymphaion", and was restored to its original form between 1954 and 1957.
From evidence of various repairs and reconstructions, four distinct building phases can be distinguished. The original floorplan is a cross with apses on four sides and a narthex on the west side, with four columns supporting a dome. The altar and floor were originally of marble. Tiles on the outer walls have Kufic-like decorative patterns.
A few surviving wall paintings in the central aisle date to the 17th century, and paintings from nearby churches were also placed elsewhere within the church.

Alice of Saluzzo, Countess of Arundel

Alice of Saluzzo, Countess of Arundel (died 25 September 1292), also known as Alesia di Saluzzo, was an Italian-born noblewoman and an English countess. She was a daughter of Thomas I of Saluzzo, and the wife of Richard Fitzalan, 8th Earl of Arundel. Alice was one of the first Italian women to marry into an English noble family. She assumed the title of Countess of Arundel in 1289.
Family.
Alesia was born on an unknown date in Saluzzo (present-day Province of Cuneo, Piedmont); the second eldest daughter of Thomas I, 4th Margrave of Saluzzo, and Luigia di Ceva (died 22 August 1291/1293), daughter of Giorgio, Marquis of Ceva and Menzia d'Este. Alesia had fifteen siblings. Her father was a very wealthy and cultured nobleman under whose rule Saluzzo achieved a prosperity, freedom, and greatness it had never known previously. 
Marriage and issue.
Sometime before 1285, Alice married Richard Fitzalan, feudal Lord of Clun and Oswestry in the Welsh Marches, the son of John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel and Isabella Mortimer. Richard would succeed to the title of Earl of Arundel in 1289, thus making Alice the 8th Countess of Arundel. Along with her aunt, Alasia of Saluzzo who married Edmund de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln in 1247, Alice was one of the first Italian women to marry into an English noble family. Her marriage had been arranged by the late King Henry III's widowed Queen consort Eleanor of Provence. 
Richard and Alice's principal residence was Marlborough Castle in Wiltshire, but Richard also held Arundel Castle in Sussex and the castles of Clun and Oswestry in Shropshire. Her husband was knighted by King Edward I in 1289, and fought in the Welsh Wars (1288–1294), and later in the Scottish Wars. The marriage produced four children:
Alice died on 25 September 1292 and was buried in Haughmond Abbey, Shropshire. Her husband Richard died in 1302 and was buried alongside Alice. In 1341, provision was made for twelve candles to be burned beside their tombs. The Abbey is now a ruin as the result of a fire during the English Civil War. Her many descendants included the Dukes of Norfolk, the English queen consorts of Henry VIII, Sir Winston Churchill, Diana, Princess of Wales, and the current British Royal Family.

Tariq Farid was born in Sahiwal, Pakistan, in 1969, the oldest of six children of Ghulam and Salma Farid. His father emigrated to the United States in the 1970s, working in Connecticut as a machinist. Tariq Farid arrived in the United States with the rest of the family in 1981, when he was 11 years old. As a teenager, Tariq mowed lawns and worked in a McDonald’s restaurant. In 1986, when he was 17, the family bought and began operating a flower shop in East Haven, Connecticut. While working in the family business, which expanded to additional locations, Tariq developed a computerized point of sale system for floral shops, and struck out on his own in 1991 in a business selling computer systems to flower retailers.

In 2006, Farid also launched the franchise concept Frutation by Edible Arrangements out of his desire to provide consumers an “on-the-go” option.
In 2010, Edible Arrangements faced dissatisfaction from some of its franchisees. In January 2010, more than 270 franchisees presented Farid with individual letters expressing opposition to corporate policies and practices that they considered to be harmful to their individual franchised businesses. The franchisees formed an association known as "EA Independent Franchisees Association, LLC", or "EAIFA" and hired an attorney to represent them in possible litigation. On September 20, 2010 the group filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of 170 franchisees, alleging that several changes the company made in its franchise agreements were unfair or violated contractual obligations to the franchisees. Edible Arrangements International, responded to inquiries about the lawsuit by saying that they strongly disagreed with the accusations and would vigorously defend the complaint. The company subsequently initiated a motion in the courts to dismiss the case, but this attempt was denied by a District of Connecticut judge on July 19, 2011 and the franchisees were granted authority to pursue the case on all claims.
Civic activities.
A Muslim, Farid is founder, together with his brothers, of the Salma K. Farid Academy, an Islamic school in Hamden, Connecticut that opened in October 2008. It is named in honor of Farid's mother, who died in 2005.

Kalaat es Senam, Kalaat Senan, or Kalâat Snan (Arabic: قلعة سنان) is a town in western Tunisia in the Kef Governorate. It is the administrative center of Kalaat Senan Delegation and had 5,044 inhabitants ( census). The town is a market town for the agriculture in the area, where wheat and oats are grown and cattle and sheep are grazed.
Kalaat es Senam is named after the nearby fortress (qalat) built upon the Jugurtha Tableland (a mesa). The Jugurtha Tableland at an altitude of 1,255 m covers an area of 80 hectares and rises 200 m vertically above its base. The fortress on its flat top was reconstructed by the 18th Century local leader "Senan", a rebel whose long resistant to the troops of the Bey of Tunis gave the town and area its name. Local drinking water comes from the Ain Senan spring at the edge of the Jugurtha Tableland. 
Senan was not the first to occupy a fortress there. Jugurtha, who gave the mesa his name, used it to hold off the Roman legions in his long war with them, 112 to 105 B.C. Legend holds that Masinissa, the first king of Numidia and ancestor of the Kabyle people, built the first fortress there around 200 B.C.

William McAloney

William Simpson "Bill" McAloney GC, OBE (12 May 1910 – 31 August 1995) was a senior engineering officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and an Australian exchange recipient of the George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth. Born in Adelaide, he worked as a mechanic before enlisting in the RAAF as an aircraft engine fitter in 1936. In August the following year, he attempted to rescue the pilot of a crashed Hawker Demon aircraft engulfed in flames at an airfield in Hamilton, Victoria. The first on scene, McAloney rushed into the wreckage in an effort to extract the unconscious pilot. The pilot's leg was trapped, however, and while struggling to free it one of the wing tanks burst, knocking McAloney unconscious. McAloney was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns and spent the next month in hospital. He was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal for his actions in the rescue attempt.
McAloney sufficiently recovered to return to his work in the RAAF, and during the Second World War was primarily involved in engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia. Commissioned as a flying officer in 1942, he saw service in Dutch New Guinea during late 1944. He received a permanent commission in the RAAF in 1948, and was advanced to squadron leader in 1950. During the Malayan Emergency, he served as technical officer to both No. 90 Wing and No. 1 Squadron, based in Singapore. In 1960, he was made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts in the post. McAloney retired in 1966 with the honorary rank of group captain. In 1971, the Albert Medal was discontinued and living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; McAloney took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the latter. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.
Early life.
McAloney was born on 12 May 1910 in Adelaide, South Australia, the eldest son of William Samuel McAloney and his wife Mary (née Murphy). The young McAloney was educated at Thebarton Technical High School and the Adelaide School of Mines. In 1925, McAloney registered for compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Force, serving as a private with the 43rd Battalion until November 1929. During this time, he gained employment as an automotive mechanic with Vrai Ltd, where he received on-the-job training in place of a formal apprenticeship. McAloney was employed with Vrai for three years, before he took a position with Adelaide Car Service.
In 1931, McAloney purchased a garage and engineering workshop in Wirrulla. He operated the establishment for the next five years, the business conducting work on various types of vehicle including cars, trucks and tractors. However, the business ultimately experienced financial difficulties and was forced to close. In a ceremony on 24 June 1935, McAloney wed Dora Winifred Johnson; the couple later had four daughters and three sons.
Military career.
Airman and Albert Medal.
In light of his business closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero fitter and turner before being attached to No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in a maintenance role within the unit, working on the Jupiter Gipsy and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.
On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon aircraft of No. 1 Squadron were on a training flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage in an effort to extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.
Although McAloney's rescue attempt was unsuccessful, the president of the RAAF court of inquiry into the incident, Squadron Leader Charles Eaton, noted his "conspicuous gallantry" and the coroner publicly commended McAloney's actions. McAloney's efforts that day were ultimately recognised with the award of the Albert Medal, the announcement of which was widely circulated in the media. The notification and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in the "London Gazette" on 18 February 1938, reading:
The award of McAloney's Albert Medal is unique, as he is the only member of the RAAF to receive the decoration. The award also proved to be the last Albert Medal bestowed upon a living Australian, with all such subsequent presentations until the medal's discontinuation in 1971 being posthumous.
Second World War.
McAloney was presented with his Albert Medal by the acting governor-general of Australia, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, in a ceremony at Parliament House, Melbourne, on 31 May 1938. McAloney recovered sufficiently from his injuries to return to his duties with the RAAF, and in September was attached to No. 1 Aircraft Depot for a period of three months. During this time he was promoted to leading aircraftman, before returning to service with No. 1 Squadron. He was formally transferred to No. 1 Aircraft Depot from August 1939, and was advanced to corporal on 1 September that year. With the outbreak of the Second World War, McAloney received a rapid series of promotions over the following eighteen months, first to sergeant in April 1940, flight sergeant in March 1941, and finally to warrant officer in February 1942. He was primarily consigned to engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia during the conflict. After making sergeant, he became No. 1 Aircraft Depot's non-commissioned officer in charge of overhaul and test work on the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. His duties were expanded with his March 1941 promotion to include the overhaul, inspection and testing of both the Kestrel and Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engines.
In August 1941, McAloney was posted to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In this capacity he advised on the procurement of equipment and spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer. Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs and served as a liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.
Promoted to temporary flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney was sent to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and gas turbine jet engines. The following November, he was dispatched to Dutch New Guinea to rectify issues being experienced with Pratt & Whitney engines in operations by aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force. He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No. 1 Communication Unit.
Post-war and senior engineering officer.
In mid-1946, McAloney was involved in an investigation into a series of engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and transport units throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the technical officer to the Changi-based No. 90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency. The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No. 90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No. 1 Squadron, then operating out of Tengah.
McAloney returned to Australia in August 1953, his next appointment being to the staff at the Department of Air in Melbourne. He possessed complete administrative control over matters pertaining to aircraft engines in this post, including the acquisition, repairs, modifications and financial expenditure on such. In 1956, he completed a course in industrial mobilisation, later undertaking a unit in industrial electronics. With his January 1957 promotion to wing commander, McAloney was transferred to Maintenance Command, where he held a policy formulation position responsible for the servicing of aircraft. He served three years in this post, being made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) in October 1960. The function of ARDU was to test aircraft from local and overseas manufacturers, evaluating whether they were suitable for acquisition by the RAAF. McAloney's role focused on the supervision of maintenance for test aircraft, along with completing modifications and fitting specialised equipment trialled at ARDU. The introduction into service of the Mirage IIIO fighter coincided with his time in this post. He was set to retire from the RAAF on reaching the age limit in 1964, but his appointment was extended a further two years owing to the shortage of technical officers. For his service with ARDU, McAloney was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year Honours List. The recommendation for the honour credited McAloney with enhancing the safety record at ARDU, and commended his constant efforts during the adoption of the Mirage and his actions to ensure the serviceability of the diverse variety of aircraft at the unit. He retired from the RAAF on 9 December 1966 and, in recognition of his 30 years of service, was granted the honorary rank of group captain.
Later life.
McAloney retired to his home in Sandringham, Victoria, where he indulged his passions in gardening and golf. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that living recipients of the decoration would be invited to exchange their medals for the George Cross, and henceforth formally become recipients of the latter award. All six living Australian Albert Medal recipients at the time opted to accept the offer, McAloney and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Stanley Gibbs, Robert Kavanaugh, Dick Richards and McAloney, were presented with their George Crosses at an investiture ceremony in Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 July 1972.
Aged 85, Bill McAloney died on 31 August 1995; the 58th anniversary of his rescue attempt. Remembered as "pleasant and fatherly – almost gracious", he was survived by his wife and six of their seven children. Two of McAloney's sons served with the Australian Army in the Vietnam War, Paul Simpson completing two tours as a corporal with the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and John Douglas as a lieutenant with the 4th and 5th Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment. John McAloney was decorated with the Military Cross for rescuing one of his men who had been wounded, and then personally clearing several caves defended by Viet Cong despite sustaining a wound himself. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in the mid-1980s before his death in 1991.

Findlay Napier

Findlay Napier, (born November 1978, Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scottish musician, guitarist and songwriter.
Biography.
Napier was born in Glasgow in November 1978 and that winter, during coldest winter on record, his parents moved to Grantown on Spey. It was there that he would spend the rest of his life until 1996 when he moved back to Glasgow to join the first ever intake of the BA (Scottish Music) course at the RSAMD.
It is somewhat of a miracle that Napier is a musician at all. After a disastrous false start with piano lessons he had all but given up on music. It was only after attending Feis Spe (part of Feisan nan Gaidhael) that his love of music was rekindled. In 1994 he was invited to a Feis for teenagers in Fort William that brought together young traditional musicians from across the Highlands and Islands. It was there he was introduced to piper Dougie Pincock and Jim Hunter who encouraged him to give up on percussion, learn to play the guitar and start singing. Later Jim Hunter would encourage Napier to start writing songs.
After graduating from the RSAMD in 1999 he played with a series of Scottish traditional music bands in Glasgow. In 2000 he had been working as Margaret Bennett's accompanist and had toured with her in Scotland and France. After working on the "In the Sunny Long Ago" with producer Martyn Bennett he was invited by Gillian Frame, Hamish Napier and Simon McKerrell to join Back of the Moon. That year Back of the Moon recorded their debut album "Gillian Frame and Back of the Moon".
Back of the Moon toured extensively from 2000 till 2007 releasing three albums and finishing with a final gig in the Kennedy Centre in Washington, D.C. on 21 November 2007.
While recording Back of the Moon's second album at Watercolour Music in Ardgour Findlay was approached by producer and engineer Nick Turner to begin a Song Writing project which they later named "Queen Anne's Revenge". They began writing on the evening of 14 December 2003 (Nick's 42nd Birthday) and had written four songs by the next morning including "Ship in a Bottle" and "Out All Night".
Before the demise of Back of the Moon, Napier began working on a project called Findlay Napier and the Bar Room Mountaineers at first this project was to bridge the gap between the traditional roots of Back of the Moon and the contemporary song and arrangements of Queen Anne's Revenge. However as the project developed it moved further from traditional material towards the contemporary Indie Folk sound they are known for today.
Findlay has hosted the 'Late Night Session' at Celtic Connections for the last two years and is the organiser of Hazy Recollections a mini festival that celebrates and connects acts whose music meets at the boundaries of the indie, folk and roots scenes.

Rebecca Lusterio

Rebecca Lusterio (born on December 3, 1989, in Balicasag Island, Bohol, Philippines) is a Gawad Urian and FAMAS award-winning Filipino actress.
Biography.
Rebeca Lusterio or Bikay for short, made an abrupt transition to show business when was cast in the movie Muro-Ami in 1999. She was chosen out of the many kids who auditioned for the role of "Kalbo". Bikay who grew up in the Balicasag Island, the movie Muro Ami depicted her prowess in swimming. The film is depicts one of the worst forms of child labor in the illegal fishing system. Fredo is the ruthless captain of 150 Muro Ami divers. The illegal fishing is done by pounding and crushing corals underwater to scare the fishes and luring them towards the nets. With a high quota to meet, Fredo forces the divers mostly children, to accomplish at least eight dives a day to meet their goal before the millennium. Tired and harassed after the burdening task being given to them, the children have to make do in subhuman conditions in the Aurora, the Muro Ami boat. They sleep in rat-infested bunks and are fed only twice a day. Life above the boat is much worse than the suffering the children encounter beneath the sea. For every dive, a child's life is perilously in danger. For her role, she was hailed as the Philippines best child actress by the FAMAS and STARS Awards.
She had TV appearances in Manila but she got frustrated by some producers’ false promises and decided to go home to Bohol to continue her studies at the Saint Augustine Academy in Panglao.
Five years after, she was wowed viewers with her role in the Visayan movie Panaghoy sa Suba (The Call of the River), a romantic film shot in Bohol with Visayan dialogues, Cebuano to be exact, with English subtitles during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II.
In 2004 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), she grabbed the Best Supporting Actress Award over veteran screen actors Jacklyn Jose, Angelu de Leon and Caridad Sanchez.
In Panaghoy, Bikay is one of the most moving characters - as the brave and obedient younger sister of Duroy (Cesar Montano) who closes the film with poetry. For an actor who never had any formal acting workshop, Bikay delivered a powerful performance, not allowing herself to be overshadowed in any scene by the more experienced ones like Daria Ramirez and Montano, who also directed the film. Even just her cry of “Nanay!” (mother) haunted everyone in the audience.
According to Ricky Lo, in his Funfare column on January 5, 2005, he reported why Bikay didn’t make it to get her award. “ It would have been her moment of glory, a victory over heavyweight opponents, but where oh where was Rebecca Lusterio during the 2004 Metro Filmfest’s Gabi ng Parangal last Dec. 29 at the Aliw Theater where she was named Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Cesar Montano’s Panaghoy sa Suba? She was in Bohol, selling seashells in her native Balicasag Island in Panglao. According to Funfare contributor and journalist Leo Udtohan, Rebecca, whom he fondly calls Bikay, would have loved to be at the awards night but, sob and sigh, she didn’t have the money to buy a ticket (plane or boat fare) to Manila and a nice enough dress to wear in an affair where everybody displays his or her sartorial best – or worst.”
Bikay is the fourth among five children of a poor couple. Her father, Verano, is a fisherman; while her mother, Helen, makes souvenir items out of seashells which she and Rebecca sell at the Alona Beach (Panglao). Bikay and her family temporarily stayed in a P600 rented house in Tawala, also in Panglao. They left Balicasag for greener pastures.
Because Bikay is low-key and self-effacing, hardly anybody knows that she’s an award-winning 
In 2004, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran through the Rev. Fr. Edwin A. Lao, O.P., rector and president, offered a full-scholarship to Bikay after she was appeared in Ricky Lo’s column. She is now a 4th year Masscom student. Bikay commutes from Bacoor (Cavite) to the Letran campus in Intramuros during school days.
In 2005, under CM Productions again (Cesar Montano with wife actress Sunshine Cruz) was part of the movie Ligalig as a film entry in the MMFF 2006. Like perhaps a lucky charm, Rebecca is once again in the festival-Cesar Montano film.
Bikay finally got her degree in AB Communication Arts last April 27, 2010 at SMX Mall of Asia as a scholar of Colegio de San Juan de Letran Manila.
Awards and achievements.
Lusterio won five awards and one nomination.
Facts.
• Discovered by Marilou Diaz-Abaya.
• Cesar Montano always casts her in films he produced. Cesar was impressed with Rebecca when they did Muro-ami (1999).
• She appeared in a musical video prepared by the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Federation headed by SK National President Jane Censoria Cajes. The musical video pays tribute to the young Boholano achievers in the Bohol Youth Week on May 26, 2008.

Richard W. Haines

Richard W. Haines (born 1957) is an American independent genre filmmaker and film historian best known for his cult movies "Space Avenger" in Technicolor, "Run for Cover" in 3-D, and "Splatter University", and the book "Technicolor Movies".
Biography.
A 1979 graduate of the film school at NYU, Haines' first job was as an assistant editor for the low-budget 1980 exploitation film "Mother's Day", directed by Charles Kaufman. This job led to a six-year association with Troma Entertainment as the company's post-production supervisor when Charles Kaufman sent Haines over to his brother Lloyd Kaufman after Haines satisfied them with his editing and sound editing work on the film.
Haines edited several films for Troma including the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger". 
During this period Haines also made his feature directorial debut independently with the widely known 1984 slasher film "Splatter University". A testament to the cult popularity of "Splatter University" is the reference by the character Randy Meeks (played by Jamie Kennedy) in a phone conversation in Wes Craven's "Scream 2" (1997). A slasher film with rare social and religious commentary as one of the more recent print reviews states, "Even some of the lesser ones have something interesting to offer, trying to go beyond the usual hack and slash routine. One such film surprisingly enough, is "Splatter University"..."
Following the commercial success of his first feature, Haines wrote a script titled "Atomic High School", which he set up at Troma to direct as a work for hire under the title "Class of Nuke 'Em High" (1986). Following completion of "Class of Nuke 'Em High", Haines left the exploitation field to form his own company, New Wave Film Distribution, Inc., which specializes in low-budget mainstream genre films. Haines retained complete creative control on all subsequent features producing, directing, writing, editing and marketing his productions.
The satirically violent sci-fi comedy "Space Avenger" (1989, co-written with Lynwood Sawyer) was the first film Haines made after going out on his own. The film was produced by the film restorer Robert A. Harris. "Space Avenger" received much attention within the film industry for being printed in the dye transfer Technicolor process, which yielded vibrant primary colors that never faded. Haines traveled to China to make prints of the film in the dye transfer "Glorious Technicolor" which was covered by "The Hollywood Reporter", "Variety" and "Entertainment Tonight". The film was retitled "Alien Space Avenger" for its home video release.
Haines donated a Technicolor print to the George Eastman House archive as an example of dye transfer printing.
Haines' next project was the 1994 sci-fi thriller "Head Games", followed the by action film "Run for Cover" (1995), which starred Adam West and featured the final film appearance of Viveca Lindfors. The film also included cameos from various well-known New York personalities such as Ed Koch and Rev. Al Sharpton. "Run for Cover" was shot in the Stereovision 3-D process and was the most successful film to ever play in Russia, as it had a five-year run. It was also premiered in Israel as part of a 3-D Festival Haines co-sponsored. Haines also co-sponsored a Technicolor Festival at the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill, New York.
Haines is the author of two books, "Technicolor Movies" (1993) and "The Moviegoing Experience, 1968-2001" (2003), and several articles published in "Wide Gauge Film and Video Monthly" and "The Perfect Vision". The former is in its second printing. Haines was also the illustrator for the 2002 children's book "Animal Kingdumb", written by his father, Richard D. Haines.
Haines' most recent features include the film noir "Unsavory Characters" (2001), the political satire "Soft Money" (2005), and a return to the horror genre, where he began his career, with "What Really Frightens You" (2008).
In 2012, Haines became a novelist. His first book, "Production Value", was released by Pigtown books. It's a thriller with a movie theme. His second novel, "Reel Danger", was released in 2013 also by Pigtown. It became part of his "24 Frames Per Second" suspense stories with continuing show biz characters based on people he worked with over the decades.

Fermín Toro y Blanco (Caracas- El Valle, 14 July 1806 - Caracas, 23 December 1865) was a Venezuelan humanist, politician, diplomat and author. Among his many public positions he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, President of the National Convention of 1858, President of the Chamber of Deputies and Plenipotenciary Minister to the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Colombia. Together with the Spanish queen Isabel II he signed in 1846 the Treaty of Recognition of Venezuela's Independence by Spain, the former colonial metropolis, which he had partially negotiated. He also negotiated border delimitations with Colombia and relevant political issues with European capitals. He is remember for his writings, oratorical skills and moral streght against dictatorship. Even though he was the author of the first Venezuelan novel he is better known for his economic and political essays. He is considered by many as the best orator in Venezuela's parliamentary history. His remains were located at the Panteón Nacional on 23 April 1876. He was related to Francisco Rodríguez del Toro and Fernando Rodríguez del Toro, important figures of the Venezuelan Independence and to María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro, the wife of Simón Bolívar. Several universities and schools have been named in his honour, including the Liceo Fermin Toro, Venezuela's largest and more prestigious public school. He has been the object of several biographies.

New international division of labour

In economics the new international division of labor (NIDL) is an outcome of globalization. The term was coined by theorists seeking to explain the spatial shift of manufacturing industries from advanced capitalist countries to developing countries—an ongoing geographic reorganization of production, which finds its origins in ideas about a global division of labor. It is a spatial division of labor which occurs when the process of production is no longer confined to national economies. Under the “old” international division of labor, until around 1970, underdeveloped areas were incorporated into the world economy principally as suppliers of minerals and agricultural commodities. However, as developing economies are merged into the world economy, more production takes place in these economies. 
This has led to a trend of transference, or what is also known as the "global industrial shift", in which production processes are relocated from developed countries (the USA, Europe and Japan) to developing countries in Asia (for example China, Vietnam and India) and Latin America. This is because companies search for the cheapest locations to manufacture and assemble components, so low-cost labour-intensive parts of the manufacturing process are shifted to the developing world where costs are substantially lower. Companies do so by taking advantage of transportation and communications technology, as well as fragmentation and locational flexibility of production. From 1953 to the late 1990s, the industrialized economies' share of world manufacturing output declined from 95% to 77%, and the developing economies’ share more than quadrupled from 5% to 23%.

Orange below world GDP (PPP) per capita]] 
The resultant division of labor across continents closely follows the North–South socio-economic and political divide wherein the North—with one quarter of the world population—controls four fifths of the world income while the South—with three quarters of the world populations—has access to one fifth of the world income.

Alien Abduction (2005 film)

Alien Abduction is a 2005 science-fiction horror film produced by The Asylum, and one of few by the same studio not produced to capitalize on the release of another film. It was released with the tagline: "The war of the worlds has just begun!", referencing the 1898 novel "The War of the Worlds" by H.G. Wells, which would be adapted to film by The Asylum two months later.
Plot.
The film begins with a group of carefree teenagers on a camping trip. As they spend the night drinking and hanging out, a light appears overhead.
Jean is the first to notice something wrong when she videotapes a UFO overhead. At first her friends do not believe her and are not convinced about the tape. That night while they are sitting around the campfire the aliens attack. Four flee for their lives, Jean still clutching the camera, but cannot escape and they are suddenly abducted by a UFO. They wake up in a cell on the ship. Jean uses the camera's night vision to explore the alien glyphs and passages. They eventually rounded up and pushed into a room where they are tied down and vivisected.
Jean awakens in a hospital, suffering from terrible flashbacks. That night a shadowy figure sneaks into her room and staples something into the back of her neck, causing the flashbacks to stop and leaving Jean with no memory of the abduction.
Jean is questioned by a staff psychiatrist, Dr. Booker, who reveals that she is in a special facility for UFO abductees. She has to remain there until they are certain that she can resume a normal life. The military attache, Commander Shakti, wants her lobotomized. Jean breaks into another wing of the hospital to find her friends and discovers that part of the hospital is reserved for mutants, the insane and the lobotomized. She sees a woman having her skull drilled. Jean is then captured by Shakti and given electric shock therapy until she is unconscious. When she wakes up, Shakti interrogates her and then sends her to an execution room. Jean lobotomizes the nurse instead and disguises the nurse as herself, by covering her with gore. She wanders around the basement, looking for a way out through the vents, until she finds an empty storage room. She explores the area, eventually finding her things in a box labelled with her name. She also finds her video camera with the tape missing, but still with its memory stick. She replays the video and is shocked to see the entire abduction on tape. She escapes the storage room, killing a guard on the way. She also sees and tapes a scientist tending alien larvae in a lab and a scientist masturbating the aliens' genitals to extract sperm.
Jean breaks into a worker's locker room and disguises herself. There she runs into her doctor Thomas. She finds out the aliens have escaped and are infecting the facility.
When the infected are killed alien larva cracks out of their skulls and escape. Jean and Thomas try to save her friends but they are a mess and Todd barely remembers Jean. Jean just gets them to safety when Todd turns on them. Thomas shows Jean the way out and reveals that the hospital is actually part of the alien ship. Todd kills Britney and Thomas and an alien larva bursts out of Thomas' head just as he dies. Jean is captured by an adult alien, but she shoots it in the throat.
Later, Jean finds herself in another lab, looking at a series of human clones of her and her friends. Shakti explains that Jean died in the abduction and she was a clone. Jean, furiously kills her clone by pulling out its umbilical cord. Dr. Brooks fakes removing jean's memory suppression chip, used to keep her memory erased before returning her home. Shakti orders the clones of her friends be resurrected as well. However, since Dr. Brooks faked the procedure Jean's memory was never erased.
Jean, Todd, Bud and Britney suddenly find themselves hiking in the woods on a sunny day, when a search and rescue helicopter spots them. They tell rescue team that they are fine. An army officer asks Jean: "Where have you been for the last two weeks?" The movie ends with Jean giving him a look.

2nd Rugby-Bundesliga

The 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga is the second-highest level of Germany's Rugby union league system, organised by the German Rugby Federation. Its set below the Rugby-Bundesliga, the top-tier of German rugby, and above the Rugby-Regionalliga, the third tier.
The league was undergoing a major revamp for the 2012-13 season with the number of clubs expanded from 20 to 24 and the league divided into four regional divisions of six teams each. Above the 2nd Bundesliga the Bundesliga was organised in a similar fashion.
History.
The Second Bundesligas were formed after the German reunion in the early 1990s, originally as four regional leagues, North, East, West and South. Later, the four leagues were merged to form the current two leagues, South/West and North/East. 
Since 2002, the two champions of the leagues play a 2nd Bundesliga championship final which also determines the club promoted to the Bundesliga.
The bottom clubs in the league are relegated to the Rugby-Regionalliga, the third tier of rugby in Germany. The top-teams of the Regionalliga are promoted in turn.
The two leagues cover the following states:
In the 2008-09 season, only nine of the sixteen German states have clubs at this level. Bremen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia and Saarland have no 2nd Bundesliga club.
With the RC Luxembourg, a team from Luxembourg, a non-German side competes in the league. The inclusion of this side in the 2009 promotion round to the 2nd Bundesliga caused some debate in regards to its legality, as the club had not qualified through the German league system and was not a member of any of the German regional rugby federations. However, RC Luxembourg's application was declared valid in regards to the German rugby federations rules and regulations and the team finished second in the promotion round, earning a place in the 2nd Bundesliga for 2009-10.
As a sign of the gap between the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga, TSV Victoria Linden, who only won the 2009-10 North/East division in the last round of the championship, declined promotion, citing the additional cost of travelling and the limited player pool as their reason. The South/West champion, Stuttgarter RC, has also indicated that it would not take up promotion, leaving the Bundesliga with only eight clubs for the next season. It also meant, for the first time ever, that no club from Hanover would compete at the top level of German rugby. "DSV 78" protested the decision to reduce the league to eight teams again and thereby relegating the club. For the 2nd Bundesliga, this also meant, only one team each would be promoted to the two regional divisions to keep the strength at ten teams per league. In the North/East, this was SC Siemensstadt, the club being directly promoted, while, in the South/West, TV Pforzheim won the promotion tournament of the five southern Regionalliga champions in Nuremberg on 12 June 2010.
On 22 August 2011, five days before the 2011-12 season start, the RG Heidelberg withdrew its reserve team from the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga South/West, citing inability to guarantee a full player squad for the whole season and thereby forcing the South/West division to compete with nine clubs only. The Berliner RC II withdrew during the season, also citing a lack of players as the reason while the RU Hohen Neuendorf was disqualified after not fielding a team in two league games.
In mid-July 2012 the "Deutsche Rugby Tag", the annual general meeting of the "DRV" decided to approve a league reform proposed by German international Manuel Wilhelm. The new system saw the number of clubs in the 2nd Bundesliga increased from 20 to 24 and the league divided into four regional divisions of six clubs each. One of the main aims of the reform was to reduce the number of kilometres travlled by individual teams and therefore reduce the travel expenses. The system will remain mostly unchanged for the 2013-14 season. The only changes will be a play-off between the fourth and fifth placed teams in each group after the first stage to determine the clubs advancing to the second stage. The championship play-offs after the second stage will be reduced from sixteen to twelve clubs with the top two teams in each group advancing directly to the quarter finals while the remaining eight will play a wild card round to determine the other four quarter finalists.
2nd Bundesliga champions until 2001.
Before the establishment of the single-division Bundesliga, the two 2nd Bundesligas determined their champion in the autumn half of the season before splitting each division into two groups, the upper half playing for Bundesliga promotion together with the bottom clubs of the Bundesliga, and the lower half against 2nd Bundesliga relegation. Teams from the two regional divisions did not meet and now country-wide 2nd Bundesliga championship as such was played. The autumn champions were:
Placings in the 2nd Bundesliga since 2001.
Since 1998, the following clubs have played in the league. From 1999 to 2001, the league consisted of two regional divisions of six teams each. After an autumn (A) round, the top three from each group would reach the championship finals round in spring (S). The bottom three, together with the top three from each of the two 2nd Bundesligas would play a promotion round in spring with the top three in each group playing in the Bundesliga the following autumn. In 1997-98 and from 2001 to 2012, the league has been played in a single-division format. Since 2012 it has been divided into a first (I) and second round (II), followed by play-offs:

Paul Allen Nicholls (10 November 1946 – 17 January 2009) was an Australian sportsman who represented Western Australia at first-class cricket during the 1970s and played Australian rules football with the East Fremantle Football Club. 
Nicholls, a right-arm offspinner, started his career in the 1971/72 Sheffield Shield season and featured in the Western Australian side for much of the following two competitions. He then spent over four years out of the team before returning in 1977/78, but re-cement his place as the state's premier spinner.
He claimed eight wickets on his first-class debut, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, including a five wicket haul in the second innings. Despite his efforts, Western Australia lost the match by 25 runs.
Nicholls spent the 1972 and 1973 English summers playing for the Haslingden Cricket Club in the Lancashire League.
Nicholls was also a good Australian rules footballer and played for East Fremantle in the Western Australian Football League. He holds a place in the club's history for his performance in the 1974 WAFL Grand Final where he kicked four goals from full-forward to help East Fremantle defeat Perth.
Later in his life, Nicholls was a successful magistrate in Western Australia before he died in 2009, after losing his battle with cancer.

Fibular hemimelia

Fibular hemimelia or longitudinal fibular deficiency is "the congenital absence of the fibula and it is the most common congenital absence of long bone of the extremities." It is the shortening of the fibula at birth, or the complete lack thereof. In humans, the disorder can be noted by ultrasound in utero to prepare for amputation after birth or complex bone lengthening surgery. The amputation usually takes place at six months with removal of portions of the legs to prepare them for prosthetic use. The other treatments which include repeated corrective osteotomies and leg-lengthening surgery are costly and associated with residual deformity.
Characteristics.
Characteristics are:
Partial or total absence of fibula is among the most frequent limb anomalies. It is the most common long bone deficiency and is the most common skeletal deformity in the leg. It most often is unilateral (present only on one side). Paraxial fibular hemimelia is the most common manifestation in which only the postaxial portion of the limb is affected. It is commonly seen as complete terminal deficiency, where the lateral rays of the foot are also affected. Hemimelia can also be intercalary in which case the foot remains unaffected. Although the missing bone is easily identified, this condition is not simply a missing bone. Males are affected twice as often as females in most series.
Causes.
The cause of fibular hemimelia is unclear. Purportedly, there have been some incidents of genetic distribution in a family; however, this does not account for all cases. Maternal viral infections, embryonic trauma, teratogenic environmental exposures or vascular dysgenesis (failure of the embryo to form a satisfactory blood supply) between four and seven weeks gestation are considered possible causes.

1991 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs for the National Hockey League (NHL) championship began on April 3, 1991, following the 1990–91 regular season. The sixteen teams that qualified, from the top four teams of the four divisions, played best-of-seven series with re-seeding after the division finals. The Conference Champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup.
This was the first of 23 consecutive years in which the Detroit Red Wings have qualified for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Their streak is the fifth longest in NHL history, and the longest active playoff appearance streak in the four major American professional sports.
The finals concluded on May 25 with the Pittsburgh Penguins winning the Stanley Cup, defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the final series four games to two. Pittsburgh forward Mario Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.
This was the first NHL playoffs without any series sweeps since the 1972-73 season.
Playoff seeding and format.
In the 1990–91 season, teams qualified based on their division standing at the end of the regular season. Playoffs then proceeded among the top four teams in each division, providing a division winner. The two division winners of each conference then played off to provide a conference winner. The two conference winners then played off in the final to produce a Stanley Cup champion.

1989 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs, the championship of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 5, after the conclusion of the 1988–89 NHL season. This was the final year that all of the Division Semifinals began with teams playing the first four games in a span of five days. The playoffs concluded on May 25 with the champion Calgary Flames defeating the Montreal Canadiens 4–2 to win the Stanley Cup Final series four games to two.
Series.
The 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs featured two Canadian hockey teams, the Montreal Canadiens and the Calgary Flames. Montreal finished the regular season with 115 points, only two behind the league leader Calgary. They had last faced each other in 1986, with Montreal winning in five games. Calgary was only the second opposing team in NHL history to win a Stanley Cup at the Montreal Forum (the New York Rangers defeated the Montreal Maroons in 1928) and the first to do so against the Canadiens.
Flames defenceman Al MacInnis won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, while Lanny McDonald, who ended the regular season with exactly 500 goals, got his name on the Cup in his last ever NHL game. Flames co-owner Sonia Scurfield became the first Canadian woman to have her name inscribed on the Stanley Cup.
On their way to the finals, Montreal lost only three games while eliminating the Hartford Whalers, Boston Bruins, and Philadelphia Flyers. Calgary survived a seven-game series with the Vancouver Canucks before sweeping the Los Angeles Kings and eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five to reach the Cup finals.
Wayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings met the defending champion Oilers in the first round. The previous season saw the Oilers sweep the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals as Gretzky earned the Conn Smythe Trophy, setting playoff records for playoff assists, assists in a finals series and points in a finals series.
On August 9, 1988, the Oilers traded Gretzky to the Kings. The Gretzky-led Kings and Oilers (with many veteran super-stars) met in the first round of the Smythe Division playoffs. In seven games, Gretzky and the Kings defeated the defending Stanley Cup champions after falling behind 3 games to 1. In the second round Gretzky and the Kings were swept by the eventual champion Calgary Flames in four games.
Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall became the first netminder to shoot and score a goal in the playoffs, a shorthanded, empty-net score in Game 5 of the Patrick Division Semifinal against the Washington Capitals. One round later, Mario Lemieux torched the Flyers for an NHL-record five goals and eight points in a 10–7 Pittsburgh win in Game 5 of the Patrick Division finals. Hextall then made headlines in the Wales Conference Finals, attacking Montreal's Chris Chelios in the late stages of Game 6 as retribution for Chelios' unpenalized hit on Flyers forward Brian Propp in Game 1. Hextall received a 12-game suspension at the start of the 1989–90 NHL season for his actions.
Former Flyers head coach Mike Keenan led Chicago to the Campbell Conference finals in his first year behind the bench. The Hawks, with 66 points, had the fewest points of any playoff team that season (and tied in the overall standings with New Jersey, a fifth-place team in the Patrick Division), yet upset first-place Detroit and then St. Louis before bowing to Calgary.
This was the only time that Bryan Trottier missed the playoffs in his entire career; he did not play in the 1992-93 season.
Division semifinals.
Smythe Division.
(1) Calgary Flames vs. (4) Vancouver Canucks.
Going into this series, many people expected that the Flames would defeat the Canucks in four or five games, due to Calgary having a 43-point edge in the regular season. Instead, Vancouver would take Calgary to seven games. The seventh game would go into overtime, both teams having great chances, the best being a breakaway for Canucks' captain Stan Smyl, only for Mike Vernon to make the save. Joel Otto scored the winner (via a deflection from his skate) with :39 left in the first overtime to send the Flames into the Smythe Division Final.
Stanley Cup Final.
The Stanley Cup Final was decided between the two teams with the best records of the 1988–89 NHL regular season. Co-captain Lanny McDonald scored the second Flames goal in game six. This turned out to be the last goal in his Hockey Hall of Fame career, as he retired during the following off-season. Doug Gilmour scored two goals in the third period, including the eventual game and Cup winner to cement the victory for the Flames.
As of 2013, this is the most recent all-Canadian final.

Visarga

Visarga (IAST: ') ( Tamil-aytam) meaning "sending forth, discharge". In Sanskrit phonology ("shiksha"), ' (also called, equivalently, "" by earlier grammarians) is the name of a phone, , written as:
Visarga is an allophone of and in pausa (at the end of an utterance). Since is a common inflectional suffix (of nominative singular, second person singular, etc.), visarga appears frequently in Sanskrit texts. In the traditional order of Sanskrit sounds, visarga together with anusvāra appears between vowels and stop consonants.
The precise pronunciation of visarga in Vedic texts may vary between Śākhās. Some pronounce a slight echo of the preceding vowel after the fricative, for example will be pronounced , and will be pronounced .
Types of Visarga.
According to Sanskrit phonologists, the visarga has two allophones, namely जिह्वामूलीय (Jihvāmūlīya or the gutteral visarga) and उपध्मानीय (Upadhmānīya or the fricative visarge). It is in fact the latter which we commonly find in writing resembling the punctuation mark of colon or as two tiny circles one above the other. This form is retained by most Indian scripts to date. The former is pronounced before the letters क, ख, प and फ. e.g. तव पितामहः कः | (Who is your grand father?) पक्षिणः खे उत्पतन्ति |(Birds fly in the sky) भोः पाहि (Sir, save me) तपःफलम् (Result of penances) etc. The Jihvāmūlīya visarga is written as two crescent-shaped semi-circles one above the other, facing the top and bottom respectively. This mode of showing the grammatical rule pertaining to the Jihvāmūlīya is still extant in the Telugu script while the allophone was completely lost in all other Indian scripts.
Tamil.
In Tamil, the visarga is called "āytam", written ஃ. Apart from a modern use as a diacritic to write foreign sounds, it is archaic and employed only in idiomatic and fossilized words such as அஃது("adhu" - "there"), இஃது ("idhu" - "here") etc. It is mentioned in the earliest available Tamil grammatical treatise, "Tolkāppiyam" (1:1:2), where it is categorized as an allophone ("cārpezuttu" "dependent sound"). 
As stated by Krishnamurti (Krishnamurti:2003 p154 ) "The properties of "āytam", as described by "Tolkāppiyam", were: (1) it occurred after a short vowel and before a stop (voiceless), and its place of articulation is like that of the stop. In other words, ஃ assimilates to the following voiceless stop".
Burmese.
In the Burmese script, the visarga (variously called "shay ga pauk", "wizza pauk", or "shay zi" and represented with two dots to the right of the letter as ), when used with joined to a letter, creates the high tone.
Japanese.
Motoori Norinaga invented a mark for visarga which he used in a book about Indian orthography.

Aldo Ferrer

Aldo Ferrer (born April 15, 1927) is an Argentine economist and policy maker. Ferrer is one of the leading proponents of economic nationalism in Argentina.
Life and times.
Early career.
Aldo Ferrer was born in Buenos Aires in 1927, and enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires School of Economics, where he received a Doctorate in 1953. He served as adviser to the UN Secretariat as a doctoral student under Professor Raúl Prebisch, and his dissertation, "The State and Economic Development", earned him early repute as a defender of industrial protectionism. Ferrer was named economic policy attaché to the Argentine Embassy in London in 1956 and in 1957 co-founded the Argentine Association of Political Economy. Following the progressive UCRI's victory at the polls in 1958, the new Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Oscar Alende, named Ferrer Minister of the Economy, from which Ferrer promoted increased spending in infrastructure and needed flood control works, for example.
His turn as chief economist for Argentina's largest province (home to over a third of the population) gave Ferrer national stature, though it also left him out of the halls of power after the UCRI's standard-bearer, President Arturo Frondizi, was forced to resign by conservative opponents in 1962. Ferrer returned to academia as Professor of Economics at the University of La Plata and at the University of Buenos Aires. In this capacity, he created a new, fourth edition of the well-known textbook, "The Argentine Economy" (translated into English at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967). Appointed a committee-member in U.S. President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, he was also invited as a founding member of the Latin American Social Science Council (CLACSO), an NGO created in 1967 in a consultative capacity to UNESCO.
The nation's top economist.
Growing instability in Argentina led to the removal of General Juan Carlos Onganía as President in June 1970. His replacement, General Roberto M. Levingston, had become a supporter of the Alliance for Progress during his turn in the Frondizi administration as head of Army Intelligence and while stationed in the Argentine Embassy in Washington, DC. Careful to placate conservatives, he appointed an "inflation hawk," Carlos Moyano Llerena, as Minister of the Economy; but, instead relied on the head of the new Ministry of Production, Aldo Ferrer, as his chief economic policy maker. Announcing new subsidies for industry, requirements for a higher domestic component in autos and other large consumer durables and the creation of a national small-business lender (BANADE), Ferrer secured increased collective bargaining rights for Argentine labor (the bast-paid and most-unionized in Latin America at the time) and became a household word in Argentina with his ads encouraging consumers to "compre nacional!" ("buy domestic").
Having entered a mild recession following a boom in 1968-69, growth reaccelerated in late 1970 and early 1971, despite the worst drought since 1952. Ferrer presented President Levingston a five-year plan in September in the hope of giving his new program a permanence seldom seem in Argentine policy and it earned him appointment as full Minister of the Economy in October, as well as the support of former President Arturo Frondizi and of economist Rogelio Frigerio, a pro-development businessman close to Frondizi. Levingston's political designs, the most controversial of which was to be the replacement of Argentina's myriad political parties with four Presidentially-sanctioned alliances, led to his replacement in March 1971 and, though Ferrer was retained by the new President, Alejandro Lanusse, the controversy helped lead to the economist's own dismissal in late May.
Later career.
Ferrer returned to academia and to his work with CLACSO, writing an economic history, "The Postwar", in 1982. Following a financial collapse, Argentina's last dictatorship called for elections in 1983. The winner, Raúl Alfonsín of the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), appointed Ferrer President of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires, the public, second-largest bank in Argentina. Limited by a shortfall in confidence in the Argentine banking system (whose deposits were dwarfed by Argentine deposits abroad) and growing differences with Alfonsín's conservative economists, Ferrer resigned in 1987.
Contributing regularly to the Economy section of "Clarín", Argentina's most important newsdaily, he became an increasingly renowned opponent of globalization, capturing what he saw as its contradictions in "A History of Globalization" in 1996, and criticizing its dependence on slave labor in "From Columbus to the Internet: Globalization in Latin America" (2000). He organized like-minded economists in his new NGO, Grupo Fénix the same year, and published "Living Within Our Means", an appeal for alternatives to dependence on foreign investment. 
The May 2003 election of center-left Peronist Néstor Kirchner following the worst economic debacle in Argentina since 1930 left free market and pro-globalization economists without the friends in Argentine government they had enjoyed for over a decade, leading to increasing state intervention in the Argentine economy. Among the results was the 2004 establishment of Enarsa, a public energy company commissioned to increase oil and gas production and to alleviate future electricity shortages such as the one Argentina suffered in April of that year. He was appointed to the company's Board of Directors in March 2006. 
Ferrer was named editor-in-chief of "Buenos Aires Económico", a local business and current affairs daily, in 2008, and in December 2010, was appointed Ambassador to France by President Cristina Kirchner.
